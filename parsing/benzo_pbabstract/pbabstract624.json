    "0": "Zopiclone (ZPC; RP 27,267), which is chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines (BZD), was found to have a similar pharmacological profile and to possess in man hypnotic activity similar to that of some BZD such as nitrazepam. It was, therefore, interesting to study the interaction of ZPC with rat brain receptors and specially with the so-called 'BZD receptors'. ZPC possesses in three rat brain regions a high affinity for BZD receptors: its Ki values measured against [3H]-flunitrazepam are 24 nM in the cerebral cortex, 31 nM in the cerebellum, and 36 nM in the hippocampus. No other brain receptors such as gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, dopamine receptor, serotonin and noradrenergic receptors are reached by ZPC. Moreover, ZPC seems to bind only to brain BZD receptors and, contrarily to some BZD such as flunitrazepam, it does not reach the peripheral renal BZD-binding sites. The synthesis of [3H]-ZPC has permitted a more in-depth study of the interaction of ZPC with brain receptors. The high affinity of ZPC has been confirmed by equilibrium-binding studies (KD = 13 +/- 4 nM in rat hippocampus) and the study of the modulating effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid and barbiturates on ZPC binding has revealed some differences between ZPC and BZD. It could, therefore, be postulated that ZPC might bind in rat brain to sites which do not correspond exactly to BZD sites.", 
    "1": "Senescent mice showed attenuation of habituation in locomotor activity and marked deficit in the motor performance requiring limb coordination. Also, the binding of 3H-diazepam to the crude synaptosomal fraction prepared from cerebral cortex of the senescent mice was significantly altered. The binding maximum (Bmax) was significantly greater in the aged (23-26 months) mice, but no change was found in the apparent dissociation constant (Kd). Senescent related changes appear to include neurochemical alteration of the endogenous benzodiazepine system (increased receptor sites without any change in receptor affinity) and, perhaps, related physiological deficits in the limb coordination and/or strength.", 
    "2": "1. The GABA agonist muscimol and the benzodiazepine diazepam both decrease dopamine (DA) release in the rat nigrostriatal pathway. 2. These actions are reversed by the GABA antagonist picrotoxin and in the case of diazepam, by the benzodiazepine antagonist RO151788. 3. Our data support an inhibitory GABAergic regulation of nigrostriatal DA neurons and indicate the presence of a GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex on these neurons.", 
    "3": "1. The inhibition of specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding to rat cortical membrane preparations (benzodiazepine receptors) by a series of amide derivatives of beta-carboline and tetrahydro-beta-carboline related to the ethyl ester of beta-carboline 3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) was measured. 2. beta-Carboline amides which are unsaturated in the C ring of the beta-carboline nucleus were the most potent inhibitors of benzodiazepine receptor binding. 3. Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon moiety in the aliphatic amide side chain beyond two carbon atoms decreased potency.", 
    "4": "Benzodiazepine receptors in the ovine frontal cortex were present at 56 days gestation and developed slowly until 96 days when the number increased rapidly, reaching adult levels by 120 days gestation. Scatchard analysis of 3H-diazepam specifically bound to cortical membranes suggested high (KD approximately equal to 2.0 nM) and low (KD approximately equal to 20.0 nM) affinity benzodiazepine receptors at all stages of development. Whereas the affinity of these receptors for 3H-diazepam did not alter during development, the number of both high and low affinity receptors increased significantly between 56 and 120 days gestation. The number of low affinity receptors were higher in late gestation and early neonatal life than in adulthood. The functional state of these receptors as determined by sensitivity to GABA did not alter during development. However, in the adult, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam, and 1-methylisoguanosine were more potent in displacing 3H-diazepam at the low affinity than the high affinity receptor, whereas chlordiazepoxide and diazepam had greater potency at the high affinity binding site. Development of the benzodiazepine receptor in the majority of other brain regions studied occurred primarily after 68 days gestation, as was the case in frontal cortex. In contrast, hindbrain and midbrain benzodiazepine receptors had reached adult levels by 68 days gestation.", 
    "5": "The changes in the number and sensitivity of benzodiazepine and GABA binding sites in the rat retina during postnatal development, adulthood and ageing and their functional relationship at different ages have been studied. Data indicate an increase in the total number of both GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites with age. In contrast, the activation of retinal benzodiazepine receptor binding by GABA is significantly reduced in aged rats with respect to young adult and newborn rats. Moreover, the activation of retinal benzodiazepine receptor binding induced by dark exposure of the animals is present in young adult rats but is lost in aged rats. These results suggest that in the retina of aged rats there is an increase of GABA and benzodiazepine receptors which have lost their functional connection.", 
    "6": "Both the anticonvulsant and sedative effects of diazepam (5 mg/kg) were reversed by subsequent administration of the suggested specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. In contrast neither the seizure threshold raising or sedative effect of melatonin (200 mg/kg) was reversed by Ro 15-1788. Ro 15-1788 had no effect on the convulsant action of the benzodiazepine Ro 05-3663. These data therefore argue against the suggestion that melatonin produces its sedative and anticonvulsant effects in vivo by interacting with the benzodiazepine receptor, and also strengthens the suggestion that Ro 05-3663 does not act at this site. The use of Ro 15-1788 in demonstrating whether a drug acts in vivo at the benzodiazepine site to produce a pharmacological response is discussed.", 
    "7": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a two-lever food-reinforced procedure to discriminate between the effect of saline and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg). After acquisition of this discrimination, the ability of morphine to generalize, and naloxone to antagonize the diazepam discriminative stimulus was tested. The rats did not generalize the effect of morphine, and naloxone did not antagonize the diazepam discriminative stimulus whether it was given prior or subsequent to diazepam. These data suggest a lack of involvement of endorphins in mediating the discriminative stimulus property of diazepam.", 
    "8": "The antagonism of the anticonflict effect of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) by beta-carboline carboxylic acid ethyl ester (BCCE), Ro 15-1788 and ACTH(4--10) has been evaluated in the Geller-Seifter rat conflict test in which CDP increases punished (conflict), but not unpunished responding. BCCE (0.5--10 micrograms ICV) produced a dose-dependent reduction in the anticonflict activity of CDP. This was also significantly reduced by Ro 15-1788 (25 mg/kg IP) and a high dose of ACTH(4--10) (5 micrograms ICV). None of these test compounds had a marked direct effect on punished or unpunished responding in the dose used. These experiments provide further physiological support for the suggestion from binding studies that BCCE and Ro 15-1788 act on benzodiazepine receptors. However, the ability of ACTH(4--10) to reduce the anticonflict effect of CDP may be by some other, possibly opioid, mechanism.", 
    "9": "Avermectin B1a (AVM) is a macrolide derived from Streptomyces avermitilis. It possesses potent anthelmintic and insecticidal activities. It immobilizes nematodes by blocking the signal transmission from the central command interneurons to the peripheral motoneurons; this block can be reversed by the chloride ion channel blocker picrotoxin. The arthropods are paralyzed by AVM through drug inhibition of both inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic potentials at the neuromuscular junctions. The mechanism of action is reduction of the muscle membrane resistance by opening the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-controlled chloride ion channels in the membrane--an action also inhibitable by picrotoxin. AVM has specific and high-affinity binding sites in the mammalian brain synaptic membrane. The sites are concentrated in the cerebellum and closely associated with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ion channel complex. GABA release from brain synaptosomes is specifically stimulated by AVM. The density of available postsynaptic GABA receptors is increased by AVM--a process which requires chloride ion and is inhibited by picrotoxin. AVM also stimulates benzodiazepine binding and potentiates the in vivo diazepam activity of muscle relaxation. These findings add up to a conclusive demonstration of the mechanism of AVM action as a potentiation of the GABA action. They also point out the research on GABA nerve in invertebrates as an attractive approach to chemotherapy against nematodes and insects and suggest AVM as a very useful tool in isolating GABA receptors and in-depth understanding of GABA function.", 
    "10": "In neurological and behavioral studies in mice, rats, dogs and squirrel monkeys, the imidazobenzodiazepinone Ro 15-1788 acted as a potent benzodiazepine antagonist. The antagonistic activity was both preventive and curative and seen at doses at which no intrinsic effects were detected. It was highly selective in that it acted against CNS effects induced by benzodiazepines but not against those produced by other depressants, such as phenobarbitone, meprobamate, ethanol, and valproate. The onset of action was rapid even after oral administration. Depending on the animal species studied, the antagonistic effects lasted from a few hours to 1 day. The acute and subacute toxicity of Ro 15-1788 was found to be very low. Benzodiazepine-like effects were not seen.", 
    "11": "In chronically implanted awake rats, microinjections of chlordiazepoxide (5 x 10(-7) M) into the dorsal raph\u00e9 significantly attenuated the inhibition of lever-pressing for food elicited by a signal of punishment. This effect is abolished by prior application of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the dorsal raph\u00e9 (3 weeks after the infusion of the neurotoxin, dorsal raph\u00e9 tryptophan hydroxylase activity was reduced to 25% of control values). Furthermore, the disinhibitory effect of intra raph\u00e9 chlordiazepoxide can be mimicked or potentiated by intra raph\u00e9 dorsalis application of serotonin (10(-7) or 10(-8) M, respectively). Further evidence for a crucial interaction between benzodiazepines and serotoninergic processes are provided by in vitro experiments showing that chlordiazepoxide or diazepam (10(-5) M) are able to facilitate the K+-evoked [3H]serotonin release from rat midbrain slices. Finally, a high density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was found in the dorsal (and the median) raph\u00e9 nucleus, the Kd and Bmax values being not altered by prior infusion of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. These in vitro data suggest possible means by which intra raph\u00e9 (and perhaps peripherally administered) benzodiazepines may affect the activity of serotoninergic neurons and thereby produce their effects on experimental anxiety.", 
    "12": "The therapeutic efficacy of ranitidine, pirenzepine, cimetidine and placebo in the 28 day treatment of duodenal ulcer was evaluated through an open randomized study performed in 120 patients. At the end of treatment, ranitidine, pirenzepine and cimetidine demonstrated a significantly higher efficacy on ulcer healing as well as on symptom relief in comparison with placebo (P less than 0.05). Data regarding cimetidine and ranitidine failed to reveal significant differences: pirenzepine, on the contrary, when compared with both the H2 blockers employed showed a slower effect on symptom disappearance. As far as functional data are concerned, placebo administration did not induce any variation of secretory or gastrinemic behaviour: on the contrary, after the end of ranitidine and cimetidine treatment a significant decrease of BAO and of MAO were found, failing to reveal any serum gastrin variation. After pirenzepine therapy no differences in the acid secretory behaviour were seen, while a significant increase of fasting gastrinemia was observed.", 
    "13": "Two sensitive and specific methods are presented for the determination of 6-OH-tetrahydronorharmane (6-OH-THN, 6-OH-THBC) and harmane (1-Me-BC). The concentration of 6-OH-THN in blood platelets from men was found 5.19 +/- 0.57 ng (mean +/- SEM) per 10(9) platelets, of acute schizophrenic patients 2.66 +/- 0.38 ng per 10(9) platelets, p less than 0.02, and in rats 6 - 13 ng x 10(9) platelets. The concentration of harmane in the urine of rats was measured 9.72 +/- 1.56 ng per 16 h. A load with ethanol caused an increased excretion of the beta-carboline in some rats. In pharmacological experiments substantial evidence was detected for a correlation between the (3H)-flunitrazepam displacing potency and the conflict-augmenting effects of beta-carbolines. Furthermore, a good correlation was found between the results of binding experiments and the antagonism of the beta-carbolines with respect to the activating effect of low doses of diazepam. No such correlation exists for the sedative effect.", 
    "14": "A number of centrally active benzodiazepines lowered baseline serum prolactin concentrations after oral administration to male rats. The increase of circulating prolactin levels elicited by oral administration of various neuroleptic agents was also reduced by prior or simultaneous oral administration of several benzodiazepines in a dose-dependent manner. Since both effects were prevented by simultaneous administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 they are probably mediated by central benzodiazepine receptors which interfere with aminergic mechanisms governing serum prolactin.", 
    "15": "Depolarization-induced release of [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]-GABA) from preloaded slices of rat cerebral cortex was inhibited by muscimol and THIP in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibition of release was prevented by the GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin. These results confirm previous reports postulating the existence of GABA autoreceptors on GABAergic terminals. Since benzodiazepines are known to facilitate post-synaptic GABA actions, the effect of flunitrazepam on the inhibition of GABA release mediated through the autoreceptors has been examined. At a concentration of 1 microM or 10 microM, flunitrazepam had no effect on the IC50 values for muscimol or THIP in inhibiting stimulated GABA release. It thus seems that GABA autoreceptors are not functionally coupled to benzodiazepine receptors in rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "16": "The benzodiazepine receptor from rat brain was solubilised and purified 5200-fold by affinity chromatography. The affinity column contained an immobilized benzodiazepine (delorazepam) and biospecific elution with 6 mM-chlorazepate was achieved. The purified receptor is apparently homogeneous in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native protein had a molecular weight of 240,000, and the subunit one of 60,000. The dissociation constant (KD) is 8 nM for [3H]diazepam. A correlation exists between the value of affinity obtained for benzodiazepine derivatives and their known pharmacological effectiveness.", 
    "17": "The interaction of diazepam and diphenylhydantoin on locomotor activity and rearing behavior was studied in mice. Pretreatment of mice with diphenylhydantoin (4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg) significantly reversed the stimulatory effects of low doses of diazepam and considerably increased the depressant effects of the benzodiazepine on locomotor activity and rearing. Neither diazepam (up to 4.0 mg/kg), diphenylhydantoin (8.0 mg/kg) alone, nor combined treatment with both drugs affected brain GABA level and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity at any dosage used. The present behavioral and biochemical data suggests that some of the pharmacological effects of diazepam need not be related to GABAergic mechanisms.", 
    "18": "Two distinct benzodiazepine receptors are solubilized differentially by various detergents. The receptor sites that resist solubilization, designated type I, are most highly concentrated in the cerebellum and corpus striatum whereas the more readily solubilized receptors, type II, are most enriched in the hippocampus. The type I receptors display higher affinity for beta-carboline esters and a triazolopyridazine whereas several benzodiazepines do not differentiate the two receptors. The type I receptors can be solubilized with 2% Triton X-100/1 M NaCl; they retain the same drug specificity as in the particulate state.", 
    "19": "Mammalian and non-mammalian species engage in aggressive behavior toward animate and inanimate targets when exposed to intermittent access to a positive reinforcer. This behavior, called extinction- or schedule-induced aggression, typically includes a biting or striking topography that inflicts damage on a target. This paper critically reviews research and theoretical issues concerning such aggression and suggests directions for future investigation.", 
    "20": "Clonazepam and chlordiazepoxide were administered chronically in increasing doses for three weeks in two different strains of mice. Forebrain [3H]diazepam binding was assayed in groups of mice sacrificed at 2, 26, 50 hr and 10 days following the last dose. Scatchard and single point analyses revealed a significant decrease in the number of [3H]diazepam binding sites [Bmax] which persisted for at least two days following chronic clonazepam treatment. The Bmax changes observed following chlordiazepoxide treatment were less pronounced than those elicited by clonazepam. No significant changes in receptor binding affinity (Kd) were detected with either drug. In the clonazepam-treated animals, Bmax values returned to normal by day 10 after drug treatment. Chronic benzodiazepine administration therefore induced a decrease in the apparent number of benzodiazepine binding sites in the mouse forebrain. The magnitude and duration of the observed subsensitivity appears to depend on the potency of the administered benzodiazepine.", 
    "21": "High affinity [3H]muscimol receptors were analyzed in the forebrain and cerebellum of mice that had been treated on a chronic regimen with chlordiazepoxide and clonazepam. In the forebrain, only clonazepam induced an increase in the number of muscimol binding sites 2 hr after drug treatment. In the cerebellum, both the chlordiazepoxide and clonazepam-treated animals showed an increased number of muscimol binding sites 2 hr after drug treatment. At 26 hr after drug treatment, only the clonazepam-treated animals still revealed an increased number of cerebellar muscimol binding sites. Chronic benzodiazepine administration, therefore, induced an increase in the apparent number of high affinity muscimol binding sites in both the forebrain and cerebellum.", 
    "22": "The effects of combined administration of ethanol (4 g/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 12.5 mg/kg) on mouse brain c-AMP and c-GMP levels were investigated in order to test the hypothesis that the supra-additive effect of CDP on ethanol sleep time may be related to a supra-additive alteration in brain cyclic nucleotide levels induced by the combined drugs. Ethanol alone or CDP by itself did not cause any change in brain c-AMP levels, except for a transient decrease in the cerebral cortex and midbrain at 0.5 hr after ethanol injection, as well as a transient increase in the cerebellum at 0.5 hr after CDP injection. The combined drug treatment did not result in a supra-additive effect on c-AMP levels. On the other hand, c-GMP levels were depressed significantly for 4 hr after ethanol injection especially in the cerebellum. The mice regained the righting reflex when the c-GMP levels were still about 30 per cent of control values. Ethanol and CDP together induced a supra-additive decrease of c-GMP concentrations in the cerebellum at 2 and 4 hr. This resulted in a lengthened period (about 2.5 hr) during which the cerebellar c-GMP levels were below 30 per cent of control values, and this interval coincided with the increase in sleep time, suggesting a possible relationship between these two factors. Injection of ethanol and N-demethyl-chlordiazepoxide (NDCDP) simultaneously (the latter being a metabolite of CDP) also elicited a more than additive depression of cerebellar c-GMP levels at 4 hr. These data suggest that NDCDP or its metabolite could be responsible for the supra-additive effect of CDP on the ethanol-induced decrease in cerebellar c-GMP levels.", 
    "23": "Repeated seizures, whether induced by kindling or electroshock, result in increased numbers of benzodiazepine receptors in hippocampal formation membranes. We sought to determine the cellular constituents containing the receptor increases. Binding studies of microdissected samples localized the receptor increases to fascia dentata. [3H]Flunitrazepam autoradiographic studies showed increases of silver grain density over the granule cell and molecular layers of fascia dentata but not in other regions of hippocampal formation. Destruction of granule cells by colchicine or neonatal x-irradiation was associated with marked decrease of benzodiazepine receptor binding. Together, these results provide evidence for localization of the receptor increases to the somata and dendritic tree of the granule cells. We suggest that this cellular localization may provide a clue to the network of altered neural circuitry underlying amygdala kindling.", 
    "24": "The pharmacological effects of an association represented by a myolitic agent (otilonium bromide) and a benzodiazepine (diazepam) were investigated on different in vitro preparations and on one in vivo test. In the isolated preparations both drugs administered alone showed a remarkable inhibitory effect on the motility of different areas of the digestive system both spontaneous and evoked by different stimulatory agents. Association of the two compounds gave rise to additive effects or actually to a potentiating effect according to the different tissues and animal species. Negative interference was never observed. The same was true also in the in vivo preparation (\"in situ\" rat pylorus). The significance and the importance of these observations are discussed also in the light of the relevant clinical implications.", 
    "25": "This study examined the effects of various drug treatments (IP injections) proposed to modify central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) activity on a conditioned suppression of drinking behavior in water-deprived rats. The subjects were trained to drink their daily water requirement during a 10-min session. Intermittent tone periods of 7 s were then introduced, the last 5 s of which the drinking tube was electrified. The animals gradually suppressed tube contacts during the tone to a low constant level within 2 weeks of training. Diazepam increased punished responding dramatically. The 5-HT antagonists methysergide (1 - 18 mg/kg), cyproheptadine (1 - 18 mg/kg), metergoline (0.25 - 2.0 mg/kg) and cinanserin (10 - mg/kg) failed to induce large, reliable increases in punished responding. When a low dose of diazepam was combined with 5-HT antagonists, only one treatment, methysergide at 3 mg/kg, potentiated the anticonflict activity of diazepam. Acute or chronic treatment with PCPA increased behavior suppressed by punishment, but this effect was weak, brief, and poorly related to the depletion of brain 5-HT. LSD (0.3 - 100 microgram/kg) administered 1, 10, or 30 min before the test was ineffective in overcoming suppression by punishment. Mescaline (6 - 30 mg/kg) had no significant effect on punished responding. 5-HTP (18 mg/kg) decreased the number of shocks accepted, but not after pretreating with carbidopa. Pretreatment with carbidopa plus 5-HTP potentiated the anticonflict effect of diazepam. The 5-HT agonist mCPP (0.25 - 2.0 mg/kg) enhanced suppression due to punishment, but only in doses that interfered with unpunished responding. The 5-HT-releasing agent fenfluramine (0.25 - 1.0 mg/kg) did not affect this behavior. Amitriptyline pretreatment in a dose not affecting unpunished behavior (5.6 mg/kg) potentiated the diazepam-induced increase in punished responding. These results are difficult to reconcile with the proposal that suppression of behavior consequent to punishment is related to brain 5-HT activity.", 
    "26": "GABA-ergic systems are involved in all the main functions of the brain. In most brain regions impairment of this system produces epileptic activity. GABA-mediated inhibitory function can be enhanced by drugs of at least seven different types. They act on the metabolism or synaptic release of GABA, or its reuptake into neurones of glia, or on various components of the GABA receptor complex (GABA recognition site, \"benzodiazepine\" receptor or chloride ionophore). Among such compounds, those which act most specifically and potently on GABA receptors remain primarily research tools. Among compounds in clinical use, valproate, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsant barbiturates al enhance GABA-mediated inhibition. In the future, new inhibitors of GABA uptake, new GABA agonists and potent inhibitors of GABA-transaminase are likely to become available. Trials of drugs enhancing GABA-ergic function have been made in a wide variety of neurological disorders. In most forms of epilepsy a therapeutic effect is evident. Real benefit from GABA therapies has not been demonstrated in the principal disorders of movement (Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, dystonias), except in so far as they have a myoclonic or paroxysmal component. Among psychiatric disorders the acute symptoms of schizophrenia are exacerbated by enhanced GABA-ergic function. Abstinence syndromes (alcohol, barbiturate or narcotic withdrawal) are ameliorated by drugs enhancing GABA-ergic function, and there is some evidence for a beneficial action in anxiety states and mania. Attempts to relate the molecular neurobiology of GABA with clinical pharmacology are of very recent origin. Improved understanding of the variety of GABA receptor mechanisms will provide the key to the more selective pharmacological manipulations that are required for therapeutic success.", 
    "27": "1. Normal and chlordiazepoxide (0.4 mg/kg/day, per os) treated cats were trained on a symmetric go-no go successive discrimination task with positive reinforcement. 2. The treatment impaired the acquisition, but not the performance once the task was learned. 3. Serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and noradrenaline were assayed in 12 brain areas in trained cats, and in normal and treated cats which did not undergo the training. 4. The treatment produced localized changes in the serotonin: 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ratio and the noradrenaline level; these effects were modified by the training. 5. The drug induced an acquisition deficit rather than a general behavioral disinhibition, and produced neurochemical effects which were dependent upon the brain area, the treatment duration and the behavioral state.", 
    "28": "Three separate in vitro admixture experiments were accomplished with bleomycin and other common parenteral medications. Bleomycin was assayed by a radioimmunoassay procedure. Bleomycin was found to be compatible with a majority of drugs including the aminoglycoside antibiotics, the vinca alkaloid antineoplastics, the antimetabolite fluorouracil, several phosphate salt corticosteroids, diphenhydramine and the anticoagulant heparin sulfate. Incompatible admixtures include the acidic cephalosporin and penicillin-derived antibiotics, the antineoplastics, methotrexate, and mitomycin C, the sodium succinate salt of hydrocortisone as well as ascorbic acid (vitamin C).", 
    "29": "1. The effects of drugs has been studied on escape behaviour of rats following electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey, in order to assess the feasibility of using the latency to escape as a measure of experimental anxiety. 2. Escape latencies were decreased by methysergide and cyproheptadine, whilst lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) increased the latencies. 3. ACTH marginally decreased escape latencies, and did not alter the response to lorazepam. 4. Difficulties associated with using this paradigm to detect anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects of drugs are discussed.", 
    "30": "Three benzodiazepine derivatives are currently indicated specifically for the treatment of insomnia in the United States. Flurazepam is biotransformed to at least two rapidly appearing and rapidly eliminated intermediate metabolites which probably contribute to sleep induction. The final metabolite, desalkylflurazepam, appears slowly, but has a long half-life ranging from 40 to 150 h. This metabolite accumulates extensively during multiple dosage. Temazepam is a slowly absorbed drug and has an intermediate half-life in the range of 10-20 h. Triazolam has an intermediate absorption rate, but is rapidly eliminated (half-life 1.5-5 h) making it essentially non-accumulating. Understanding of the pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepine hypnotics can contribute to understanding of their clinical properties.", 
    "31": "Zopiclone (RP 27 267) is an hypnotic with a chemical structure different from that of the benzodiazepines (BZD) or barbiturates. Studies of zopiclone in classical psycho-pharmacological tests, in comparison with BZD and barbiturates, have shown that it exhibits the five main types of activity considered as characteristic of the pharmacological profile of BZD and partly of that of barbiturates (anticonvulsant, myorelaxant, antiaggressive, sedative-hypnotic and 'anticonflict'). However, like BZD, zopiclone differs from barbiturates by a high safety margin. Electrophysiological studies performed in cats have shown that zopiclone induces modifications in sleep-wakefulness pattern which are close to those observed with BZD, specially with nitrazepam. Moreover, zopiclone increases the threshold for arousal by reticular formation stimulation, rather more than nitrazepam, but with a shorter duration of action. The short duration of action of zopiclone has been demonstrated in other species using different tests.", 
    "32": "We carried out a randomized double-blind study. This was a crossover design with two periods of 2 days each with one compound (either zopiclone or triazolam). The next 2 days of active trial periods the patients were allowed to choose the preferred coloured capsule of which both neither the patients nor the investigators knew about its real contents. 40 volunteers were chosen from our patients suffering from chronic alcoholism who just finished their detoxification. There were given coloured coded capsules, each of them containing either 0.25 mg triazolam or 3.75 mg zopiclone. The capsules should be swallowed when patients felt a desire for alcohol. The maximal dosage was 8 capsules per day (2.0 mg triazolam and 30 mg zopiclone). There was a significant difference of degrees of freedom and probability at a level of 0.0005 for the items of the Addiction Research Centre Inventory and a level of 0.0005 for the items of the 'profile of mood states'. None of the volunteers developed a special desire for zopiclone after withdrawal of the medication.", 
    "33": "The reinforcing properties of zopiclone (3.75 mg) and triazolam (0.25 mg) and their side effects were studied in a double-blind crossover design, followed by forced choice in 40 volunteers taken from a population of chronic alcoholic inpatients who had just completed withdrawal from alcohol. After initial interview when the physician checked if the inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, patients were submitted to the following assessments: profile of mood states (POMS), ARCI subscales (items of scales No. 452, 129, 125, and 52), drug record form and vital signs, SESI (side effect checklist), preference form, subjective effect scale (subscale 220 of the ARCI), and withdrawal assessment. No difference between the drugs could be found on the POMS, ARCI or in the drug intake. There was a difference in patients' drug preference for triazolam in comparison to zopiclone. Zopiclone, like triazolam, may induce some feelings similar to those obtained with alcohol. Side effects noticed by patients were of mild to moderate degree and harmless.", 
    "34": "In an experimental analog of verbal examinations, the call-up situation, the effects of two dosages of a tranquillizing agent (lopirazepam) are compared to placebo treatment. 72 male and female, healthy, young volunteers have been randomly assigned to 12 groups of 6 subjects each. Pulse frequency and performance were registered. The results indicated differential drug effects which were interpreted according to the hypotheses of 'differential effects of social stressors'. If a situation was highly challenging for a subject, the application of a tranquillizer in an adequately high dosage enabled him to perform well in spite of or because of strong increases in pulse frequency.", 
    "35": "A survey of the literature over 10 years (1970--1980) shows that the phenomenon of 'rebound' can appear after withdrawal of a large number of drugs belonging to various chemical classes and also, as a physiologic compensatory mechanism of the central nervous system, without drugs. Among the various drugs, benzodiazepine hypnotics are also mentioned in problems related to 'rebound' (insomnia, anxiety). Controversial opinions are expressed regarding the appearance of rebound insomnia or anxiety. It seems that those authors who believe in the existence of rebound relate it either to therapy with high doses of drugs or to hypnotics with short to intermediate half-life.", 
    "36": "Over the past five years, the mechanisms of action of several classes of antianxiety drugs have been clarified. Benzodiazepines, triazolopyridazines, and barbiturates seem to produce their anxiolytic effects by interacting with a specific high affinity receptor (viz. benzodiazepine receptor) in the brain. The benzodiazepine receptor is functionally and perhaps structurally coupled to a receptor for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA as well as a chloride channel or ionophore. Taken together, this receptor \"complex\" may mediate the behavioral effects of a number of chemically diverse antianxiety agents. Evidence for the role of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-chloride ionophore complex inthe mechanism of action of minor tranquilizers and a possible interaction with the novel anxiolytic buspirone is discussed.", 
    "37": "Clinical trials have indicated that buspirone (Buspar) is effective in the treatment of anxiety with efficacy and dosage comparable to diazepam. Until recently it has been thought that antianxiety drugs must alter benzodiazepine receptor binding in vitro. However, buspirone lacks any structural similarity to te benzodiazepines and does not interact with the benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) axis. Specifically, buspirone neither stimulates nor inhibits [3H]benzodiazepine binding, does not affect the influence o GABA or halide anions on benzodiazepine binding, and does not interfere with GABA binding or uptake. Behavioral testing has revealed that buspirone does not produce muscle weakness, does not control seizures, does not potentiate the impairment of psychophysiological function or lethality produced by administration of CNS depressants, does not produce sedation/hypnosis and does not appear to possess any abuse potential or liability for physical dependence. Thus, buspirone has been termed an anxioselective agent. Buspirone appears to only interact with the dopaminergic system with reasonable potency and exhibits properties of both a dopamine agonist and a dopamine antagonist. This suggests that dopamine is implicated in the etiology and expression of anxiety. A discussion of this implication is presented with a review of the clinical efficacy of nonbenzodiazepine drugs, especially dopamine agonists and dopamine antagonists, in the management of anxiety. In addition, neuropharmacological studies which have investigated the role of dopamine in animal models of anxiety are considered. Finally, the multiplicity of dopamine receptors and their regional localization in the brain are considered in the formulation of an hypothesis which features a role for the dopaminergic agents in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety.", 
    "38": "Five observations in adult subjects (4 female, 1 male) in which the administration of chlordesmethyldiazepam (2-4 mg/day) alone, or in association with other psychodrugs has demonstrated a specific anti-erotic action, with a short therapeutic latency period, reversible, and not found in other benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, lorazepam, flunitrazepam, prazepam) which the patients had previously taken, are presented in detail. One of the cases was diagnosed with Cl\u00e9rambault Syndrome of seven years' duration [Acta psychiat. belg., 82, 555-564 (1982)].", 
    "39": "The capacity of the benzodiazepine drugs to produce dependence and addiction has been associated with what has recently been recognized as a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment may show a spectrum of symptoms similar to those observed from withdrawal of alcohol or barbiturates. Such reactions have been reported with and are reviewed for the following drugs: chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, and clobazam. Generally, the higher the dose and the longer the benzodiazepine is taken, the greater the risk of developing withdrawal symptoms. However, withdrawal symptoms may occur in patients receiving recommended doses and/or short-term therapy. Although most withdrawal reactions have been reported with the long-acting benzodiazepines having psychoactive metabolites, reactions may also occur with the short-acting agents. In contrast, rebound insomnia occurs with greater frequency and severity with the short-acting agents. Benzodiazepine therapy should be stopped as early as possible, with tapering after moderate dose and/or prolonged use therapy.", 
    "40": "Studies were made of the effects of the benzodiazepines clonazepam (Cz), flunitrazepam (Fz) and Diazepam (Dz) on the spontaneous release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the anterior horn of the lateral cerebral ventricle of cats superficially anaesthetized with urethane. The amount of released ACh was determined in 15-min samples by a bioassay on a segment from isolated guinea-pig ileum. It was found that benzodiazepines applied i.p. in doses of: 5 mg/kg (Dz), 10 mg/kg (Cz) and 0.5 mg/kg (Fz) decreased the ACh release in the effluent flowing out through the cannulated aqueduct. If the released ACh in the sample taken immediately before the administration of benzodiazepine was considered to be 100 per cent its amount in the samples after injection of benzodiazepine changed as follows (in per cent): for Dz - 34.2, 70.2, 65.7, 40; for Cz - 46.3, 33.1, 26, 50.6; and for Fz - 46.1, 46.1, 28.2, 39.4. It is assumed that the benzodiazepine-induced reduced release of ACh from the caudate nucleus--a main structure participating in the building up of the anterior horn of the lateral cerebral ventricle--is a manifestation of inhibition of ACh turnover which might be due to inhibition of the activity of the serotoninergic neurons in the raphe nuclei. The decreased ACh release might also be due to inhibition by benzodiazepines of the Ca2+-dependent release of ACh.", 
    "41": "An evaluation of the anticonvulsant effect of five kinds of benzodiazepine derivatives using amygdaloid-kindled rats yielded the following pharmacological properties of benzodiazepine derivatives: (1) Bromazepam, lorazepam and nitrazepam block the behavioral seizure response and also shorten the after-discharge duration simultaneously in both primary and secondary epileptogenic foci. (2) Diazepam has little effect on shortening the after-discharge duration at least in the primary epileptogenic focus though it blocks the behavioral seizure response. (3) Although clonazepam can block the behavioral seizure response and shorten the after-discharge duration, further investigations are necessary to define its efficacy.", 
    "42": "It has been found that a short period of severe intoxication with ethanol produces a marked reduction of adrenal catecholamines. Animals so treated demonstrate moderate to severe withdrawal signs. Accordingly, adrenal and urinary catecholamines were determined in rats undergoing withdrawal after treatment with several drugs known to modify sympathetic function. The depressant diazepam obtained withdrawal severity without altering peripheral catecholamines, propranolol reduced urinary catecholamines and transiently ameliorated withdrawal, whereas hexamethonium elevated urinary catecholamines and enhanced the severity of withdrawal. No drug treatment modified adrenal catecholamine levels. In this model the attenuation of adrenergic function has no consistent influence on the manifestation of withdrawal after ethanol.", 
    "43": "The effects of benzodiazepine (mainly diazepam) on the following central action of narcotic analgesics were tested: antinociceptive action (Randall-Selitto and hot plate tests), hypermotility, inhibition of methylphenidate stereotypy, catalepsy. Diazepam, in doses not affecting the pain threshold markedly potentiated morphine, codeine, etorphine, pentazocine and fentanyl antinociception. Hypermotility produced by morphine and fentanyl was inhibited by pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and clonazepam. Diazepam potentiated the inhibitory effect of opiates on methylphenidate-induced stereotyped gnawing in mice and increased the catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl in rats. In all experiments the effects of diazepam were suppressed by the substances which impair GABA-ergic neurotransmission: bicuculline and picrotoxin. Obtained results indicate that benzodiazepine potentiate the antinociceptive and cataleptogenic effects of opiates and their inhibitory influence on methylphenidate stereotypy. However, these drugs antagonize locomotor hyperactivity in mice. All these actions seem to be related to facilitation of GABA-ergic neurotransmission by benzodiazepines.", 
    "44": "The effects of triazolam (0.25 mg) or flurazepam (15 mg) were evaluated in 13 elderly (ages 64-79) insomniacs. Subjects were reasonably healthy, ambulatory, and complained of disturbed sleep. Sleep apnea syndromes were ruled out by nocturnal polysomnogram. Sleep, daytime sleepiness [Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS)], performance, and mood [Profile of Mood States (POMS)] were assessed on five consecutive days. Placebo was given on nights 1 and 2; active medications were given on nights 3-5. Sleep time was increased by approximately 1 h in both groups. MSLT showed increased sleepiness with flurazepam and decreased sleepiness with triazolam. MSLT scores were unrelated to nocturnal sleep parameters in the flurazepam group and showed a pattern of correlation, though nonsignificant, in the triazolam group. Vigilance was impaired with flurazepam and unchanged with triazolam. Other performance tests showed slight improvement or no change with drugs. Mood tended to be improved after flurazepam ingestion and unchanged after triazolam. These findings suggest that, although both compounds improve nocturnal sleep in elderly insomniacs, there is significant residual sedation with flurazepam and improved daytime alertness with triazolam. Neither compound had a significant effect on nocturnal respiration in these non-sleep-apneic elderly subjects.", 
    "45": "1. Evaluation of the side effects of psychoactive drugs presents a special statistical situation because many of the symptoms of psychiatric disorders are also potential side effects. 2. Reported incidences of adverse events can be viewed as being a combination of psychoactive drug effects, disease state effects and other concomitant effects. 3. An intriguing statistical problem is to develop methodology to separate these effects. 4. This paper discussed four methodologies for estimating incidence of side effects assessed with a symptom and side effect check list.", 
    "46": "1. Twenty-nine patients with anxiety neurosis who had completed a one week placebo, three week active drug study on either halazepam or oxazepam were observed for eight weeks for withdrawal effects. Half of the patients received a placebo for the first two weeks of the withdrawal study and half had all medication abruptly stopped. 2. There was no significant difference in the pattern of withdrawal between halazepam, an intermediate range benzodiazepine, and oxazepam, a short acting benzodiazepine. 3. Withdrawal symptoms were apparent, maximally between week 1 and 2 together with possible rebound effects. 4. Patients who received placebo had significantly less severe withdrawal symptoms than those who had their medication abruptly discontinued.", 
    "47": "1. The effects of five benzodiazepines (Ro 21-3981, flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide, medazepam and clozapine) on GABA-mediated electrically-evoked cortical inhibition were tested. 2. These five drugs were chosen because their solubility in water allows their microiontophoresis and because their relative affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor in rat brain membranes have been measured. 3. When tested with equal iontophoretic doses in 11 different neurons, the degree of potentiation of electrically evoked cortical inhibition produced by these benzodiazepines correlated significantly (r = -0.60704; p less than 0.01; phi = 33) with the logarithm of the Ki values of these drugs for inhibiting specific 3H-diazepam binding to rat brain membranes. 4. When tested with iontophoretic doses which were directly proportional to their Ki values for inhibiting 3H-diazepam binding to rat brain membranes, these benzodiazepines produced very similar potentiations of electrically evoked cortical inhibition.", 
    "48": "Benzodiazepine receptor binding and the concentration of the free tissue GABA, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, and 13 other amino acids were estimated in specimens of cerebral cortex and cerebellum taken from normal foetuses and from perinatal and postnatal infants and adults postmortem. Compared with the ontogenetic increase, previously reported, in [3H]muscimol binding, that of [3H]flunitrazepam binding developed more rapidly in the cerebellum and less rapidly in the cerebral cortex. The concentration of GABA in both brain parts increased with age more rapidly than did that of glutamate decarboxylase activity. The overall pattern of developmental changes in the amino acid concentrations in the human brain showed many similarities with those reported in the brains of experimental animals. The concentration of the amino acids associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle increased with age. Although the general downward trend in the levels of essential amino acids (with the exception of Met) was also evident in the human cerebral cortex, this was not the case in the cerebellum where the concentrations of most amino acids were relatively low in the foetus whereas the concentrations exceeded the cerebral cortical levels in the adult.", 
    "49": "Post-IHD episode memory problems and their correlates were investigated among 157 male ischemic heart disease patients under the age of 65. Twenty-five per cent of these patients reported memory difficulties originating during the year following admission to hospital. Of the wide variety of socio-demographic factors, measures of disease severity, and lifestyle variables evaluated, only three differentiated those patients with post-IHD episode memory problems from patients with no memory difficulties. These three were: quitting smoking during the year following hospitalization, using psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines), and having high psychosocial stress levels one year after discharge. Further analysis revealed that stress was related to memory problems primarily because stressed patients were more likely to use psychotropic drugs. It was suggested that the relationship between quitting smoking and memory problems could be explained by reference to two contradictory effects of tobacco use: a short-acting memory facilitating effect due to nicotine and a longer lasting memory impairment due to smoking-related atherosclerosis which might persist long after giving up smoking.", 
    "50": "The effect of antiepileptic drugs on the EEG was studied in a review of 23 controlled trials with therapeutic drug monitoring and serial EEG observations. There is a good correlation of suppression of paroxysmal discharges and an increase in the plasma concentrations of diazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, alone or in combination with phenobarbital or primidone. The correlation is variable during treatment with carbamazepine and in patients with focal discharge receiving sodium valproate or a delayed response to sodium valproate treatment. An increase in beta activity is correlated with a raised plasma concentration of clonazepam, phenytoin and phenobarbital, but not in all patients receiving these drugs. The degree and the localization of cerebral impairment seem to influence the drug-induced fast EEG response. Slowing of background occurs with high plasma concentrations of diazepam, phenytoin, alone or in combination with phenobarbital or primidone. The correlation of paroxysmal discharges with clinical seizure frequency is good for phenobarbital, phenytoin, alone or in combination. The correlation is variable for carbamazepine and the delayed response to sodium valproate. A slowing of background activity is correlated with clinical drug toxicity due to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and primidone treatment in most patients.", 
    "51": "Quantitative EEG measures provide reliable, non-invasive indices of CNS effects of drugs in man. In pharmaco-EEG studies of CNS-active substances, we found that EEG changes correlated with blood drug levels within individuals over time, and showed the correlation to be replicable. Across individuals at single times, however, correlations were not evident. In seeking relationships across subjects, techniques which adjust for EEG baseline differences between subjects are under investigation.", 
    "52": "Unanaesthetized spinal cats were used to assess the effects of several central depressant drugs on GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition. Benzodiazepines enhance GABAergic inhibition by interaction with specific receptors in the spinal cord. Phenobarbital facilitates GABAergic inhibition by a mechanism unrelated to that of benzodiazepines, perhaps by an effect on the Cl- ionophore within the GABA-benzodiazepine-barbiturate receptor complex. A similar mechanism or the inhibition of GABA re-uptake might be responsible for the facilitating effect of valproate on GABA transmission. By selectively inhibiting GABA transaminase, L-cycloserine presumably increases the amount of GABA available for release.", 
    "53": "In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 60 insomniac patients (including 41 aged 65 or older), 15 mg of quazepam was compared with placebo as a hypnotic. Patients received treatment for five consecutive nights after an initial three-night baseline period. Data on efficacy and safety were collected via postsleep questionnaires, physical and neurological examinations, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, and routine laboratory tests. According to patient's reports, the quantity and quality of sleep were significantly better (P less than 0.01) in the quazepam-treated group than in the group receiving the placebo. The physician also rated quazepam the better treatment. Eleven patients, six receiving quazepam and five receiving the placebo, had adverse experiences, including ataxia, which was observed in two quazepam-treated and one place-bo-treated patient. The resuls confirm that quazepam in a dosage of 15 mg/night is safe and that it is more effective than placebo in treating insomnia in older patients.", 
    "54": "In an initial interview, 20 volunteer subjects provided 32 personal constructs of anxiety, using Kelly's repertory grid technique. The bipolar ends of the anxiety constructs were then separated by 10-point rating scales. Subjects could then indicate the degree of anxiety feeling on their own personal constructs. The 20 subjects were divided into high and low trait-anxiety sub-groups, on the basis of Speilberger trait-anxiety (personality) scores. Subjects were administered acute single doses of 20 mg clobazam or matching placebo, in a counterbalanced double-blind design. Anxiety levels on the individual personal constructs of anxiety were measured 2 h after drug administration. There was a significant ANOVA interaction effect between drug condition and trait-anxiety. Of the ten subjects in the high trait-anxiety sub-group, eight demonstrated reduced levels of personal construct anxiety under clobazam (three significantly). In contrast, of the ten subjects in the low trait-anxiety sub-group, nine demonstrated increased levels of personal construct anxiety (eight significantly). The present results are discussed in relation to previous similar findings. Clobazam and other benzodiazepine derivatives (such as diazepam) are effective anxiolytics with the clinically anxious and with normal volunteers having high trait-anxiety personalities. However, normal subjects with low trait-anxiety personalities often produce paradoxical increases in anxiety feelings.", 
    "55": "This study evaluated contingent reinforcement for benzodiazepine-free urines as a therapeutic intervention for promoting reduced use of supplemental benzodiazepine drugs among methadone maintenance outpatients. Ten methadone maintenance patients were selected for participation on the basis of positive urinalysis results. During a 12-week intervention period these patients were offered clinic privileges, including monetary payments or methadone take-home doses, contingent on benzodiazepine negative urinalysis test results. Eight of ten participants responded to the intervention with at least 2.5 weeks of consecutive clean urines. An increase in benzodiazepine-negative tests during the contingent reinforcement period was significant for the group as a whole. The results suggest that more widespread application of contingent reinforcement procedures may be warranted in drug abuse treatment clinics.", 
    "56": "Two groups of 30 outpatients, each with various types of anxiety and sleep-disturbance, were treated with 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4(3H,5H)-dione (Clobazam, Frisium 20) for 28 days. The double-blind, randomized study was designed to find out whether there is a significant difference between the application of the drug in the morning (group A) or at night (group B). The results of 22 patients of group A and 24 of group B could be evaluated. The following tests had been made at the beginning, after 1,2 and 4 weeks of treatment, respectively: 1. Clinical global impression (CGI) of therapeutic effect and side-effects. 2. Symptoms of psychic and somatic anxiety (HAM-A). 3. Sleep (documented by self-rating and investigator). 4. Daytime-drowsiness/dizziness (self-rating scale). 5. Choice reaction time (CRT) tested between 8 and 9 a.m. on the same day once a week. 6. Critical flicker fusion (CFF) tested between 8 and 9 a.m. on the same day once a week. Sleep and daytime-drowsiness/dizziness have been tested daily within the first week. Significant therapeutic improvement could be stated after 4-week treatment by the CGI-test. The CFF-frequency as indicator for vigilance rose to a significantly higher level while the reaction time in the CRT-test was simultaneously reduced. This result was in accordance with earlier studies. Both groups compared with each other, however, did not differ significantly in any of the parameters used. Symptoms of psychic and somatic anxiety have been reduced significantly in both groups after the first, second and fourth week. There was however one remarkable difference between both groups: this refers to the psychic anxiety factor (HAM-A) only. Here the patients of group B (clobazam in the morning) showed better results than the others. This phenomenon may be due to elevated serum levels during daytime. Therefore we recommend in case of predominant psychic anxiety clobazam to be taken in the morning or in divided doses in the morning and in the evening.", 
    "57": "7-Chloro-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-5-(o-fluorophenyl)-1, 3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-thione (Sch 16134, quazepam) demonstrated high safety and effective hypnotic properties. Toxicity of quazepam in mice was extremely low at the largest doses administered of 5000 mg/kg p.o. and 1370 mg/kg i.p. as compared to LD50 values for flurazepam of 756 (635-889) mg/kg p.o. and 254 (234-280) mg/kg i.p. In cats, quazepam did not produce overt toxicity even at the highest dose administered, 1000 mg/kg p.o., whereas death occurred after the administration of flurazepam at a median dose of 250 mg/kg p.o. In addition, flurazepam produced central excitation and convulsions. Quazepam did not affect hemodynamic parameters in conscious dogs and anesthetized cats. Autonomic functions were virtually unaffected by the drug in anesthetized cats. In interaction studies in mice, quazepam did not interact with cimetidine while it potentiated the sedative activity of alpha-methyldopa, ethanol and propranolol. The CNS depressant properties of quazepam were further investigated by studying its effects on spontaneous motor activity in mice and EEG pattern in immobilized cats. In mice, quazepam reduced locomotor activity at doses which did not impair motor coordination thus differing from flurazepam which did. In the EEG study, quazepam produced a slow wave EEG pattern comparable to that of physiological sleep, while flurazepam induced a similar EEG activity which alternated with a fast frequency pattern of moderate amplitude. Quazepam also showed potent anticonvulsant activity. These results suggest that quazepam is likely to be a safe and effective sleep-promoting agent.", 
    "58": "7-Chloro-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-5-(o-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1, 4-benzodiazepine-2-thione (Sch 16134, quazepam) is a new hypnotic drug with demonstrated clinical efficacy. Quazepam has been shown in our laboratories to have potent hypnotic activity and fewer side effects at effective doses than flurazepam, which was studied concurrently. Hypnotic potency was estimated in mice via antagonism of electroshock-induced convulsions (ECS), potentiation of hexobarbital-induced sleeping time, and chlorprothixene potentiation. The respective oral ED50's (95% fiducial limits) in the 3 tests were 0.9 (0.4-2.0), 0.5 (0.3-0.8) and 0.05 (0.02-0.08) mg/kg for quazepam and 1.6 (1.1-2.3), 0.6 (0.4-1.0) and 0.11 (0.07-0.42) mg/kg for flurazepam. The duration of action of quazepam as measured by antagonism of ECS in mice was similar to that of flurazepam at equi-effective doses but quazepam had a faster onset. When potential tolerance to hypnotic efficacy was studied, quazepam did not show tolerance after dosing 20 mg/kg p.o. twice daily (b.i.d.) for 5 days, whereas tolerance was seen with flurazepam at equi-effective doses b.i.d. for 5 days. In conscious, unrestrained squirrel monkeys and cats, quazepam produced sedation with less ataxia and less evidence of CNS stimulant action than flurazepam. On the basis of the aforementioned studies, quazepam should be an effective hypnotic with less potential for ataxia, paradoxical excitation, and tolerance than flurazepam.", 
    "59": "In the present review the effects of 1,3-dimethyl-5-amino-adamantane (DMAA, D-145, Memantine, Memantine) on various neurotransmitter systems were presented. The most marked effect of DMAA seems to be the stimulation of dopaminergic neurons as reflected by the respective behavioural changes and biochemical effects. The stimulatory action on noradrenaline and serotonin neurons (at least partially indirectly through the activation of dopamine system) as well as on GABA neurons is apparent. No direct effects on Dopamine, alpha 1, alpha 2, Serotonin, GABA, benzodiazepine and opiate receptors were found. DMAA can be assigned to a new class of compounds which act mainly as dopaminomimetics, but its mode of action is apparently different from those of amphetamine or apomorphine. It differs quantitatively and qualitatively from amantadine, another derivative of adamantane.", 
    "60": "A group of 410 primarily anxious psychiatric outpatients treated with chlordiazepoxide, 244 treated with diazepam, and 537 receiving placebo were asked to report any significant favorable or unfavorable life events which occurred during both the first and the second 2 weeks of a 4-week double-blind drug trial. The frequency with which favorable and unfavorable events were reported did not differ across medication groups. However, patients reporting unfavorable events showed significantly less improvement after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment than did patients reporting no events or patients reporting favorable events. The amount of improvement experienced by patients reporting positive events did not differ significantly from that of patients reporting no events. The size of the impact of reported events upon outcome did not vary with treatment agents. Essentially similar results were obtained when data based on 2- and 4-week patient improvement ratings were analyzed. It was concluded that the occurrence of significant life events during the course of drug trials of the type involved here did not affect the sensitivity with which drug-placebo differences could be detected.", 
    "61": "Using Geller and Seifter's conflict behaviour test, ketazolam in rat increases the rate of responses emitted both with and without punishment. Nortriptyline decrease the non-punished component of the schedule without influencing the punished one. With combined treatment, nortriptyline does not modify the effects of ketazolam on punished responses while nortriptyline, 1 h after administration, decreases, though not significantly, the facilitating action of ketazolam. After 24 h it significantly increases the depressant action of this benzodiazepine. The results suggest that with the combination tricyclic anti-depressant-benzodiazepine, as with these two categories of drugs, there is not always an increase in disinhibiting action, while depressant action has characteristics closely dependent on the properties of the benzodiazepine used.", 
    "62": "The efficacy and safety of 15 mg quazepam was compared with placebo in 57 geriatric outpatients with insomnia. The study was double-blind, with treatments randomly assigned to patients. Placebo was taken by all patients for the first 3 nights followed by either placebo or quazepam for 5 nights. Post-sleep questionnaires were completed each day and the physician and patients rated the treatment at the end of the study. Quazepam was significantly better than placebo on all measures of efficacy. Indices of sleep quantity and quality showed that 15 mg quazepam produced significantly greater improvement in sleep than placebo on the first night of treatment and for the treatment period as a whole. There were no reports of unexpected or serious adverse experiences, and quazepam did not cause ataxia or impairment of motor co-ordination in any patient.", 
    "63": "A study was carried out to assess the effect of maternal administration of 5 mg lorazepam orally 1 hour before induction of labour on the well-being of healthy babies at term, as judged by neonatal feeding behaviour. The results, compared in 18 bottle-fed neonates of mothers in the lorazepam group and 20 from the control group of mothers who received no pre-induction medication, showed that lorazepam had no significant effect on the volume of milk taken or the duration of the feeding process during the first 48 hours of life.", 
    "64": "Bromazepam was administered in a single dose of 1.5 mg one-half hour before bedtime to study its short-term action and the effect of its discontinuation on the sleep of 6 children suffering from night terrors. On the third night of the drug's administration, a statistically significant reduction in slow-wave sleep was observed which was maintained after the drug had been discontinued. The other sleep parameters were not significantly affected, although a slight increase in REM sleep was seen after discontinuation of bromazepam, with a statistically significant increase in the second third of the night on the first 2 nights 'off medication'. A comparison of the individual nights yielded no significant change in heart rate, although certain internal changes were observed during the second night 'on medication' and during the nights 'off medication'. These changes can be explained by the changing relationship between cardiac variability and sleep organization. There were insufficient episodes of night terror during the short duration of the study to allow any conclusions to be drawn on the effect of the drug on this aspect.", 
    "65": "9 normal subjects were tested on a large battery of tests the morning after a hypnotic dose of flunitrazepam (0.5 mg and 1 mg) and a placebo. Each drug was given for 8 nights and assessments were made 10 and 13 h later on days 1, 4 and 8. Self-ratings of sleep were made every morning. The tests comprised mood and bodily symptom self-ratings, taping rate, visual reaction time, symbol copying and substitution tests, critical flicker fusion threshold, digit span and cancellation test. The EEG was recorded under eyes open and eyes closed conditions and analysed using broad waveband filters. Subjectively, the 0.5 mg dose was associated with increased alertness, contentment and calmness, the 1 mg dose with minimal decrease in alertness and contentment. Sleep onset was accelerated by flunitrazepam initially but effects on quality of sleep were not major due to subject selection. The 1 mg dose occasionally impaired performance on tapping, symbol copying and substitution and critical flicker fusion. The 0.5 mg dose marginally impaired symbol substitution and improved symbol copying. The EEG showed definite dose-related effects which tended to increase over the 8 nights of ingestion of the drug. It is concluded that whereas the 1 mg dose may sometimes be associated with definite residual effects the next day, the 0.5 mg dose possesses positive qualities in producing useful subjective effects the next day without appreciable impairment of psychological performance.", 
    "66": "1. Adenosine and its analogs depress the firing of neurons in various brain regions. The primary mode of action of adenosine in exerting this effect appears to be the depression of transmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals. This is a result of reduced calcium mobilization. 2. Adenosine uptake inhibitors and deaminase inhibitors depress the firing of central neurons. Adenosine antagonists, caffeine and theophylline, excite central neurons. Adenosine is therefore likely to be released in sufficient quantities to exert an ongoing modulation of synaptic transmission in the intact brain. 3. A number of groups of centrally active drugs inhibit adenosine uptake by brain synaptosomal preparations. These include the benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, various other sedatives and hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, some steroids, diphenylhydantoin, puromycin and toyocamycin. 4. It is proposed that many agents with anxiolytic, sedative, analgesic or anti-convulsant actions may achieve their effects by inhibiting adenosine uptake and thus potentiating extracellular adenosine levels. 5. Morphine also elevates extracellular adenosine levels but achieves this by enhancing adenosine release.", 
    "67": "In 3 double-blind randomized trials, clorazepate was compared to placebo in post-infarction and pre-infarction patients, and diazepam was compared to placebo added to verapamil. There was a significant reduction in trinitrate requirement in the first clorazepate study but not in the second nor in the third, although this has not yet been completed. Taking all 3 trials together, there were 5 cases of myocardial infarction in 63 patients treated with placebo but no cases in 64 patients treated with the anti-anxiety drugs (p less than 0.05). Relief of anxiety was accompanied by reduction in the anginal attack rate with both active and placebo medications. In further similar studies in hypertension, relief of anxiety was also accompanied by reduction in blood pressure. However, in a 4-way comparison between lorazepam, bendrofluazide, lorazepam plus bendrofluazide and placebo, mean normotensive levels were only achieved in patients treated with the combination of anti-anxiety and antihypertensive medication.", 
    "68": "The correcting action of sydnocarb on the side effects of phenazepam was studied in experimental and clinical conditions. The effect of sydnocarb on the myorelaxant, hypnotic, and tranquilizing effects of phenazepam was determined on 144 mice and 87 rats. Comparative clinical trials of phenazepam with regard to the same effects were carried out on 102 patients with anxious-depressive states. The patients received phenazepam both in combination with sydnocarb and alone. The experiments and the clinical trials have shown that sydnocarb reduces the myorelaxant and hypnotic effects of phenazepam without influencing its tranquilizing action. The phenazepam: sydnocarb ratio optimal for correcting the side effects of the tranquilizer was found to range with 1: 1.25 to 1:2.5."
