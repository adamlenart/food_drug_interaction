    "0": "The anxiolytic activity of methylclonazepam was compared to lorazepam and placebo in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study, using a latin square design, in 18 inpatients meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorders. Patients presented at least 1 year of symptomatology and had a minimum score of 20 on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, despite chronic anxiolytic pharmacotherapy. Daily dosage was flexible, from three to six tablets of methylclonazepam 1 mg, lorazepam 2.5 mg, or placebo. Clinical evaluation included Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI), a side-effects checklist, completed every 2 days, and the global preference of the patient for one of the treatment periods. Results showed a highly significant superiority of both benzodiazepines over placebo on the Hamilton Scale (P less than 0.000001) and CGI (P less than 0.001), and also a significant superiority of methylclonazepam over lorazepam on the Hamilton Scale (P less than 0.01), CGI-1 (P less than 0.01), and in the number of patient preferences (14 versus 1; P less than 0.001), with no significant differences in side-effects or related to position in the trial. These results support the value of the cross-over design in chronic and severe anxious inpatients for the demonstration of differences in efficacy between anxiolytic pharmacotherapies.", 
    "1": "Sleep-wakefulness patterns recorded following 1 night total sleep deprivation were studied in 15 normal subjects and in 252 epileptic patients. The patients were taking various types and combinations of antiepileptic medication. Sleep deprivation caused a reduction in sleep latency and an increase in NREM stage 3 + 4 sleep. This effect persisted in patients treated with valproate sodium and/or carbamazepine. In patients treated with diphenylhydantoin light NREM 1 + 2 sleep increased. In those treated with antiepileptics + chlorazepate, both an increase in NREM 1 + 2 and NREM 3 + 4 sleep was seen. The former probably reflects a benzodiazepine effect, the latter is due to a sleep deprivation effect. In patients treated with antiepileptics + clonazepam, a benzodiazepine effect predominated.", 
    "2": "Amino acid concentrations were measured in the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of the mouse brain before and during seizures induced by isoniazid (250 mg/kg i.p.), an inhibitor of L-glutamate-1-decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15: GAD). Valproate sodium and diazepam dose-dependently delay the onset of convulsive fits caused by isoniazid. However, neither diazepam nor valproate prevented the decrease in GABA concentrations produced by isoniazid alone. Also, these antiepileptic drugs did not modify the rate of GABA depletion elicited by isoniazid. These results, observed in four different brain structures, strengthen those first obtained with beta-vinyllactic acid, another inhibitor of GAD.", 
    "3": "The effects of phenobarbital, clonazepam, valproic acid, ethosuximide, and phenytoin were examined in pigeons performing under a delayed matching-to-sample procedure. Clonazepam, valproic acid, ethosuximide, and phenytoin typically reduced the rate of responding to the sample stimulus, whereas phenobarbital usually increased response rates at high doses. Phenobarbital, clonazepam, and valproic acid produced generally dose-dependent decreases in accuracy; ethosuximide and phenytoin failed to do so. These results suggest that there are qualitative as well as quantitative differences in the effects of anticonvulsant drugs under the delayed matching-to-sample procedure.", 
    "4": "Pavlovian control of tolerance to the sedative and hypothermic effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) was demonstrated in two experiments. In Experiment I, drug-experienced rats were repeatedly treated with CDP (30 mg/kg) in one environment (CS+); on alternate days, they were given saline injections in a different environment (CS-). Duration of sleeping and inactivity were used as measures of sedation. A comparable conditioning procedure was used in Experiment II, but tolerance to the hypothermic effect of CDP was the dependent measure. During tolerance testing, rats from both Experiments I and II were given CDP in one of three environments, CS+, CS-, or a novel environment (CSnov). In Experiment I, rats were equally tolerant in all three test environments when duration of sleep was assessed. However, when inactivity was used as the measure of tolerance, rats showed tolerance in CS+ and CS-, and significantly less tolerance in CSnov. Drug-naive controls showed similar nontolerant responses to CDP in all environments, thus ruling out the possibility that the effect of sedation was mediated nonassociatively. In Experiment II, drug-experienced rats showed tolerance to CDP-induced hypothermia in CS+ and CS- but less tolerance in CSnov. A compensatory hyperthermia was observed when these rats were given saline in CS+. There was some evidence for a generalization gradient in the conditional control of tolerance in both experiments.", 
    "5": "In order to assess the role played by serotonin (5-HT) in subjective anxiety, three groups of 12 healthy volunteers were given 12 mg metergoline (MET), 10 mg diazepam (DZ) or placebo (PB), under double-blind conditions, and submitted to a simulated public speaking (SPS) test. MET increased state-anxiety scores, measured by Spielberg's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The effect of MET was significantly different from both the PB and DZ groups immediately before the SPS test (prestress) as well as 24 h after medication, and from the DZ group only, 2.5 h after the test (poststress). In contrast, DZ did not significantly affect subjective anxiety. The SPS test significantly increased anxiety in DZ- or PB-treated subjects as compared to prestress scores, whereas the increases in the MET group were not significant, probably because pretest levels were already high. No drug effect on heart rate, skin electrical conductance and quality of sleep during the night following medication was found. In addition, the drugs did not cause bodily symptoms that could secondarily affect mood. Since MET is a 5-HT receptor antagonist, active on the central nervous system, an inhibitory role of 5-HT on subjective anxiety might be suggested.", 
    "6": "Seventeen normal, healthy adults were trained to discriminate between orally administered d-amphetamine (AMP; 10 mg) and placebo. Standardized subjective effects questionnaires were used to examine the relationship between the subjective and discriminative stimulus effects of AMP. Seven of the subjects were able to learn the discrimination reliably. These seven \"discriminators\" did not differ from the ten \"nondiscriminators\" in their subjective ratings of mood in the absence of drug. Discriminators were generally more sensitive than nondiscriminators to the subjective effects of AMP, although this difference in sensitivity reached statistical significance only for ratings of \"hungry.\" Stimulus substitution was tested in the the discriminators with other doses of AMP (2.5 and 5 mg) and with 10 mg diazepam. The discriminative stimulus properties of AMP were dose-dependent, with 5 mg being the threshold dose. In five of the seven subjects the discriminative stimulus properties of diazepam did not substitute for those of AMP. The results demonstrate that the experimental paradigm can be used successfully to study the discriminative stimulus properties of drugs directly in humans.", 
    "7": "Tocainide (W-36095, Xylotocan) is a derivative of lidocaine which is applied clinically as a cardiac antiarrhythmic. In addition, it diminishes the severity of symptoms in neurological disorders such as myotonia and paramyotonia and in patients with torticollis spasmodicus it brings about a distinct reduction in the tension of the neck muscles. It was investigated whether in reducing the tonus in torticollis spasmodicus tocainide could be acting on the central nervous system. The binding affinity of the substance to the dopamine, serotonin, opiate, GABA and benzodiazepine receptors was measured without finding any significant affinities. In addition, the effect of tocainide on the concentration of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (noradrenaline), dopamine, serotonin and histamine were investigated in rat brain, and it was found that tocainide induces a significant increase in dopamine and serotonin concentrations. This lead to the conclusion that, in addition to its antiarrhythmic effects, tocainide acts on the central nervous system.", 
    "8": "Although maternal aggression in rats is confined to a restricted post-partum period, the high and stable aggression level and the constancy of its behavioural structure make it an attractive experimental procedure for studying the behavioural effects of psychotropic drugs. Female rats were tested against naive male intruder rats for 5 or 10 min on post-partum days 3-9, during which aggression is stable. Chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, orally) had a biphasic effect on aggression; it increased aggression considerably at 5 and (to a lesser extent) at 10 mg/kg. At 20 mg/kg aggression returned to control level. CDP shortened the latency to the first attack at 5 mg/kg, but not at higher dosages. CDP enhanced aggression, particularly in the first 2 min of an encounter. It did not change the structure of the aggressive behaviour, but did induce a dose-dependent increase in feeding. Fluprazine (Flu; 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg IP), a specific antiaggressive (serenic) drug, induced a dose-dependent decrease in aggression and exerted its largest effect in the first 2 min of an encounter. In accordance with the reduced aggression, latencies to the first attack increased. Maternal aggression in rats represents an extension to other (male) aggression paradigms in psychopharmacology. First, it has no male counterpart. Secondly, the hormonal mechanisms underlying this behaviour differ from those of male aggression. Thirdly, the morphology of maternal aggression is different from that shown in male models of agonistic behaviour (e.g. resident-intruder). These features make maternal aggression an attractive paradigm for pharmacological studies of female behaviour.", 
    "9": "The daytime psychomotor performance of 12 healthy subjects of mean age 81.4 years was examined in a double-blind crossover study following single and repeated nightly doses of nitrazepam 5 mg, lormetazepam 1 mg, and placebo. Accuracy of performance on the Gibson spiral maze was unaffected by both drugs. On a reciprocal tapping task, speed was similarly unaffected. However, while neither drug significantly impaired accuracy on reciprocal tapping after the first dose, nitrazepam, but not lormetazepam, significantly reduced overall accuracy after seven consecutive doses, an effect consistent with drug accumulation.", 
    "10": "The role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in mediating the stress response was studied using a behavioral test in which anxiety or conflict influence performance. Rats implanted with intraventricular cannulae were tested in a Geller-Seifter conflict test modified for incremental shock. CRF produced a dose-dependent attenuation of punished and nonpunished responding in the conflict test. Chlordiazepoxide increased punished, but not unpunished, responding and produced a dose-dependent reversal of CRF-induced response suppression. CRF had no effect on tail flick or hot-plate analgesia tests. The results support the hypothesis that CRF produces behavioral effects consistent with \"anxiety\" or an increased responsiveness to stress.", 
    "11": "There were marked strain differences in the duration of the protective effects of diazepam against the convulsant actions of penylenetetrazole and picrotoxin in mice. In no case was significant protection found at 12 h or longer, regardless of whether the incidence of or the latencies to myoclonus or tonic-clonic convulsions were considered. These behavioural differences could not be explained simply in terms of strain differences in benzodiazepine metabolism or in percent of receptor occupancy, as determined by the fractional displacement of 3H-flunitrazepam binding in vivo. It is suggested that there might be strain differences in the percent of receptor occupancy needed in order to produce an anticonvulsant effect.", 
    "12": "A conveyor belt task for assessing visuo-motor coordination in the marmoset is described. Animals are motivated by apple, a preferred food, under a state of minimal food deprivation. The apparatus used was designed to test animals within their home cages and not restrained in any way, thus avoiding possible confounding factors associated with restraint stress. Stable baseline levels of performance were reached by all animals in a median of 24 sessions. Performance was shown to be differentially sensitive to the effects of four psychoactive drugs. Moderate doses of diazepam, chlorpromazine and pentobarbital disrupted visuo-motor coordination in a dose-related manner. The possibility that disruption of performance observed at higher doses may have resulted from non-specific actions of these drugs such as decreases in feeding motivation were not supported by results from ancillary experiments. Changes in performance characteristic of high dose effects were similar in nature to changes observed when the degree of task difficulty was increased. Doses of d-amphetamine up to and including those reported to produce signs of stereotypy failed to influence performance. The potential of the conveyor belt task for measuring visuo-motor coordination in both primate and rodent species is discussed.", 
    "13": "Diazepam self-administration was studied in rhesus monkeys under several conditions of availability. Lever-press responding was maintained in twelve monkeys under a fixed-ratio 10 (FR 10) schedule of IV cocaine or pentobarbital delivery in daily sessions of 1-3 h duration. Each of several doses of diazepam (0.012-0.4 mg/kg/infusion) or vehicle was periodically substituted for 5-14 consecutive sessions. Between each substitution, responding was maintained by the baseline drug (cocaine or pentobarbital). Another procedure was to decrease the response requirement for drug delivery to a fixed-ratio one (FR 1). In three of eleven monkeys studied under conditions of a cocaine baseline and the FR 10 schedule, responding was maintained by diazepam and was inversely related to dose. In each of five monkeys tested in a similar manner but with a pentobarbital baseline, at least one dose of diazepam maintained responding above vehicle levels. Three of these monkeys had previously failed to self-administer diazepam under the cocaine baseline condition. Subsequently when two of these monkeys were returned to the cocaine baseline, diazepam was not self-administered above vehicle levels. Under FR 1 conditions of substitution, vehicle and pentobarbital intake increased in each monkey tested and cocaine intake increased in two of four monkeys. Diazepam self-administration also increased but did not exceed vehicle levels under the FR 1 schedule. However, in two monkeys the number of diazepam infusions was increased compared to the FR 10 substitution condition. These results emphasize the importance of testing drugs under several conditions to determine their relative dependence potential.", 
    "14": "The imidazodiazepine Ro 15-1788 is a proposed benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Recently however, behavioural effects of Ro 15-1788 have been demonstrated. In the present study, rats (n = 12) were trained to discriminate Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg, IP, t = 15 min) from vehicle in a two-lever food-reinforced procedure. All rats showed a reliable discrimination (mean injection-appropriate lever responding greater than 85%) after about 60 daily training sessions. Drug stimulus control was evidenced by an orderly generalization gradient obtained with 0.01-30 mg/kg Ro 15-1788 (ED50 for stimulus generalization: 0.12 mg/kg). Since even low doses of Ro 15-1788 have discriminative effects in the rat, it is concluded that Ro 15-1788 may have potent behavioural activity.", 
    "15": "Critical flicker-fusion frequency (CFF) has often been applied to psychotropic drug evaluation as a measure of cortical arousal. There are several variables that must be considered for proper conclusions to be obtained from CFF experimental data. Psychological variables such as subject response bias are especially difficult to control. We studied the effects of single oral doses of 10 mg diazepam and 10 mg amphetamine sulfate on CFF values obtained by a block up-down spatial forced-choice method on 13 healthy volunteers (seven males and six females). Signal detection theory was also used to obtain the non-parametric value P(A) as a measure of sensory function and B as a measure of the psychological function of response bias. As a group, amphetamine increased CFF (Hz) and P(A) and diazepam decreased CFF (Hz) and P(A), with the most significant effects observed at 2 and 3 h after drug administration. B scores showed more individual variation with a trend towards a low score, or a tendency to report more flicker responses after diazepam. Separated by sex, the males had a higher percentage of subjects that demonstrated a reduction of CFF after diazepam, while the females had a higher percentage that demonstrated an increase in CFF after amphetamine. The results suggest that CFF changes following diazepam and amphetamine are mostly changes in sensory function and not changes in response bias. It is possible to apply signal detection theory to flicker-fusion studies and the accounting of bias by controlling, measuring or eliminating it is essential in interpretation of CFF data.", 
    "16": "Ten normal male volunteers were administered oral diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) or placebo followed 45 min later by IV naloxone (1.2 mg) or placebo. Diazepam produced a marked decrement in performance on tests of memory, visual psychomotor skills, reaction time, and time production. Naloxone alone had no effect on these measures and failed to interact with the diazepam. These findings do not support a role of the endogenous opioid system in normal human cognitive processes or in the behavioral effects of diazepam.", 
    "17": "Forty-six patients with various forms of endogenous depression were treated by night sleep deprivation (NSD) which was used as the cardinal method of treatment. A single session of NSD induced a considerable clinical improvement lasting 2-3 days in the majority of patients. Repetition of the procedure (3-6 times with a 2-3 day interval) led to a significant and stable clinical improvement in 32 of the 46 patients. The highest effect of treatment was observed in such symptoms as depression and suicidal tendencies, whereas in patients with vital anxiety, the efficacy of NSD was considerably lower. Individuals with the duration of the phase under one month and the greatest reduction of the symptomatology after the recovery night showed the greatest response to the treatment. Favourable prognostic signs included such symptoms as psychomotor inhibition, lassitude and apathy, although the tempo of their reduction in the process of treatment considerably lagged behind improvement in the general mood, sleep and regress of autonomous disorders. Activation of the noradrenergic system is assumed to be one of the main mechanisms of NSD action.", 
    "18": "Rats were trained to respond to one of two levers under a random ratio schedule of food reinforcement. Which of the levers was correct was redetermined before each response and signalled by a light. The effects of d-amphetamine (0.2-3.2 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (1-8 mg/kg), and the neuroleptic alpha-flupenthixol (0.03-0.33 mg/kg) on the efficiency of rats tracking this visual cue were examined. d-Amphetamine increased the proportion of responses made on the correct lever at low and intermediate doses, but reduced the proportion at 3.2 mg/kg. At the highest dose, chlordiazepoxide produced a small increase in this measure, together with a reduction in response rate, but alpha-flupenthixol had no effect, even at a dose reducing response rate. Low doses of amphetamine also increased switching between the levers, producing a proportionately greater increase in switching from the correct lever to the incorrect lever than vice versa. The results are interpreted as showing that d-amphetamine facilitates tracking performance as a result of its action of enhancing response switching, and supporting the hypothesis that facilitation of performance by amphetamine-like drugs depends on the effect of the drug on response output coinciding with task requirements.", 
    "19": "The influence of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 on the convulsant properties of flurazepam (FLZ) was studied in rats. Animals were prepared with chronic epidural electrodes for EEG recording and respiratory rates were recorded via a rubber bulb connected to a pressure transducer. FLZ convulsive thresholds were determined by continuous IV infusion in the presence and absence of Ro 15-1788 pretreatment. All animals receiving the FLZ infusion experienced convulsions preceded by dose-dependent reduction of respiratory rate. Pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 substantially reduced the FLZ convulsive threshold, suggesting a blockade of the depressant (anticonvulsant) aspect of the FLZ effect, thus, augmenting a convulsant effect at a separate receptor. An alternate hypothesis is that Ro 15-1788 may increase the affinity or intrinsic activity of the receptor responsible for the convulsant aspect of FLZ. Ro 15-1788 did not appear to alter the respiratory rate depressant effect of FLZ, although early onset of convulsions in the pretreated animals precluded measurement of respiration at the higher dose of FLZ allowable in animals that were not pretreated with the antagonist.", 
    "20": "One-third of Wistar rats bred in our laboratory present recurrent seizures whose EEG and clinical symptomatology resemble those of human petit mal. Bilateral cortical synchronous spike- and wave discharges (7-11 c/s; 200-600 microV, lasting 0.5 to 40 s) accompany behavioral arrest and are associated frequently with facial myoclonia. These seizures, observed as long as the animals survive, appear spontaneously and seem to be unrelated to surgical procedures. Antiepileptics in common clinical use were tested. Ethosuximide (greater than 12.5 mg/kg), diazepam (greater than 0.5 mg/kg), trimethadione and sodium valproate (greater than 50 mg/kg) suppressed these discharges in a dose related manner. Carbamazepine and phenytoin were ineffective or aggravated the seizures. Phenobarbital, effective at 2.5 to 10 mg/kg, was ineffective at 20 mg/kg. The similar effects of these antiepileptics on both the rats' seizures and human petit mal confirm the hypothesis that this phenomenon constitutes a valid pharmacological model of petit mal epilepsy. Its predictive value appears to be superior to that of other currently used models.", 
    "21": "The EEG effects of diazepam and pentobarbital at the level of cerebello-rubral pathways (i.e., cerebellar cortex, interposed, fastigial and red nuclei) were studied. The drugs elicited a slowing of frequency and an enhancement of the voltage of the waves at the level of cerebellar and red nucleus leads. The effect was antagonized by picrotoxin or pentamethylenetetrazole, while ethyl - 8 - fluoro - 5,6 - dihydro - methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazol [1,5 a][1,4]benzodiazepin-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788) antagonized only the effect of diazepam. The relationships between the EEG alterations and the behavioural effects of diazepam and pentobarbital, which are endowed with muscle relaxing, sedative-anesthetic and anticonvulsant activity, are discussed.", 
    "22": "General anesthesia was induced in eight subjects by the slow IV injection of 60 mg diazepam. During the anesthetic effect, the EEG was characterized by 3-5 Hz high voltage activity. Immediate recovery of consciousness and reversal of the EEG pattern to fast low voltage activity was obtained after the IV injection of 60 mg aminophylline. On the other hand, three diazepam-treated subjects who received IV saline instead of aminophylline recovered from anesthesia 73-120 min after saline.", 
    "23": "The present study was designed to assess the discriminative stimulus properties of cocaine in pigeons. Six pigeons were trained to discriminate IM injections of cocaine (2 mg/kg) from saline with responding maintained under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food delivery. Cocaine, d-amphetamine, and l-cathinone substituted completely for the training dose of cocaine in all pigeons. When nicotine (0.25-4.0 mg/kg), apomorphine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), procaine (4-32 mg/kg), and lidocaine (4-16 mg/kg) were substituted, both partial substitutions and individual differences between pigeons were observed. Oxazepam (0.5-4.0 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (2-8 mg/kg) failed to substitute for the training dose of cocaine. Discriminative stimulus control by cocaine was greatest when the drug was administered 10-40 min prior to the session and the effects disappeared after 2 h. The substitution results indicate drug class specificity of the cocaine cue but, in addition, suggest its multidimensional nature.", 
    "24": "Weanling rats were treated with diazepam, apomorphine, and haloperidol to study the influence of the dopamine (DA) system on the audiogenic immobility reaction and open field locomotory behavior. Treatment with diazepam (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent shortening of the duration of the immobility response. Treatment with apomorphine (0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/kg) shortened both the immobility reaction and the latency to leave the spot where the animal was first placed in the open field (latency for first crossing). Locomotor activity increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Both grooming and rearing showed biphasic dose response curves, with a maximum occurring at the 0.125 mg/dose for grooming and at the 0.25 mg/dose for rearing. Haloperidol (0.06 mg/kg) exerted opposite effects to those of apomorphine, but also produced increased running during the auditory stimulation (flight distance). Using the immobility reaction as an expression of fear, we concluded that activation of the DA system decreases while inhibition of the DA system increases fear. It was hypothesized that the DA system exerts an inhibitory function in the expression of fear.", 
    "25": "The effects on body temperature of the benzodiazepine contragonists FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) and DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-7-oxo-4H-imidazo-(1,5-a)(1,4)benzod iazepin e -3-carboxylate) and the benzodiazepine agonist, flurazepam, were investigated in mice. Both of the contragonists and flurazepam reduced the body temperature. The antagonist Ro 15-1788 did not alter body temperature alone but significantly antagonised the effects of FG 7142 and of flurazepam. The effects of the latter two drugs on locomotor activity in animals in a familiar environment were also investigated. Flurazepam reduced the activity counts in these circumstances but FG 7142 did not cause a significant change, at doses which considerably reduced body temperature. The drug FG 7142 also reduced the body temperature in rats. The effects on body temperature of the benzodiazepine contragonists and flurazepam were unusual in that they were changes in the same direction, both antagonised by Ro 15-1788. However, they differed in that while the effects of flurazepam on locomotor activity might contribute to its hypothermic effect this did not appear to be the case for FG 7142.", 
    "26": "Following a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg, the pharmacokinetics of Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, have been investigated in 20 healthy male volunteers. In random order injection of Ro 15-1788 has been preceded (5 min) by intravenous dosing with 0.06 mg/kg of lormetazepam (n = 6), 0.03 mg/kg of flunitrazepam (n = 8) or placebo (n = 6). The rapid elimination of the antagonist could be characterized by an elimination half-life between 0.9 to 1.4 h and a total plasma clearance of 727 to 1440 ml/min. These single dose studies indicate that the disposition of Ro 15-1788 was not affected by the acute coadministration of both benzodiazepines.", 
    "27": "The kinetic profiles of diazepam (DZP) were investigated in plasma, erythrocytes, and discrete brain areas in the rat, and the effects of valproic acid (VPA), given as sodium valproate, on kinetic parameters were analyzed. The experiments were performed on two groups of rats treated daily for 15 days, the first receiving only DZP (5 mg/kg/day i.m.), the second treated with DZP (5 mg/kg/day i.m.) and VPA (200 mg/kg/day i.p.). Our results indicate that VPA influences the plasma-protein binding and erythrocyte levels of DZP, as well as its kinetic profile. These data are discussed with regard to the modifications observed in the different brain areas (cerebellum, hippocampus, whole cortex, and pons-medulla) during administration of VPA and DZP. The results presented in this study offer evidence that VPA exerts a peculiar action on the \"impregnation\" and kinetics of DZP in the CNS, and therefore these findings may be of importance in clinical pharmacology and treatment of epilepsies.", 
    "28": "One or more drugs were detected in 81 percent of 440 male drivers, aged 15-34, killed in motor vehicle crashes in California; two or more drugs were detected in 43 percent. Alcohol, the most frequently found drug, was detected in 70 percent of the drivers, marijuana in 37 percent, and cocaine in 11 percent. Each of 24 other drugs was detected in fewer than 5 percent. Except for alcohol, drugs were infrequently found alone; typically, they were found in combination with high blood alcohol concentrations. The causal role of drugs in crashes was assessed by comparing drivers with and without drugs in terms of their responsibility for the crash. Alcohol was associated with increased crash responsibility; the role of other drugs could not be adequately determined.", 
    "29": "We studied 41 consecutive patients receiving intravenous (IV) diazepam in the preoperative holding area to evaluate whether low-dose IV lidocaine could ameliorate pain of the diazepam injection. In a double-blind trial we found 1 cc of 1% lidocaine effective versus placebo at lowering the incidence of pain from 80% to 5% (P less than .001) and recommend its routine use as an antecedent to IV diazepam.", 
    "30": "Imipramine, phenelzine and alprazolam have each been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of panic disorder and in agoraphobia with panic attacks. Clonazepam, a 1,4 benzodiazepine derivative used mainly in neurology as an anti-epileptic, has specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties which would make it an advantageous antipanic agent. We report 8 cases of recurrent panic attacks which were successfully treated with clonazepam.", 
    "31": "Febrile seizures are a common problem. Simple febrile seizures usually occur in otherwise normal children and are brief, generalized, and relatively benign. First febrile seizures should be evaluated by a physician to rule out serious underlying disease. A careful history and thorough physical exam are essential. Routine laboratory evaluation of simple febrile seizures is seldom helpful. Other laboratory tests to determine the source of fever or cause of seizures should be obtained when specifically indicated. Although the threshold for performing a lumbar puncture should be low, it is not mandatory to obtain one in every case of simple febrile seizures. Treatment of most simple febrile seizures consists of fever control and parental counseling. Chronic anticonvulsant therapy should be limited to special circumstances.", 
    "32": "The evaluation and treatment of sleep disorders represent an important area of research and clinical practice. Attempts to improve disturbed sleep are often needed, and treatment of the primary disorder associated with the insomnia, rather than the symptom of sleep disturbance, is always desirable. Our insight into sleep physiology and homeostasis is, however, rather limited. There may be several causative factors behind sleeping problems, and the treatment must be chosen accordingly. Of the drugs marketed, benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice, but other types of drugs are often useful in selected patients. The pharmacological profiles of the various types of benzodiazepines differ markedly from one another. The rate of distribution of the drug determines the duration of effects after a single dose whereas the elimination half-life is the determining factor during continuous intake. A treatment programme based on the individual patient and the type of sleep disturbance is usually necessary. An understanding of the quality and occurrence of such phenomena as carry-over, withdrawal and rebound effects as well as dependence problems reduces treatment complications and unnecessary use of sleeping pills. A good patient/doctor relationship is also needed to minimize the potential risks as well as the unnecessary use of hypnotic drugs.", 
    "33": "In 1983, approximately 40 000 patients in France and 5 760 patients in Switzerland suffered from cerebral palsy, representing more than 0.1% of their respective populations. The functional disability of these patients is particularly impressive and emphasizes the medical, social and economic importance of this problem. The term cerebral palsy is restricted to non-progressive disorders of motor function, already observed at an early age and due to cerebral lesions. These motor disorders can be of paretic, dystonic and dyskinetic nature. Their epidemiology, classification, etiology, pathology, early diagnosis and evolution are extensively reviewed by Th. Deonna. The difficulty in evaluation of treatment is the absence of a generally accepted rating scale. G. Broggi has proposed one on the basis of a large experience which could serve in the future for more objective evaluation. This monograph is devoted to the functional neurosurgical treatment of cerebral palsy. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation are part of the basic treatment of cerebral palsy, and must be continued after any neurosurgical treatment. Various conservative methods of treatment and their neurophysiological rationale are mentioned by P. Claverie. Some technical devices which improve the neurological deficits and facilitate rehabilitation are presented. Radiculotomies and neurotomies are probably the oldest neurosurgical operations for the treatment of spasticity. The neurophysiological and neuroanatomical basis of this therapeutic approach are treated in the review of the material from the neurosurgical department of Montpellier. Sixty cases were collected and the results analysed according to the type of operation (posterior radiculotomy, anterior radiculotomy, mixed) performed. Stereotactic thalamotomies and subthalamotomies are believed to be the best neurosurgical method to treat the tremor and improve other dyskinesias and hyperkinesias. The technique and a personal review of 49 cases of cerebral palsy are presented. The long-term follow-up in this study demonstrates that this type of operation markedly improves the functional disability of patients with moderate hyperkinesias, moderately improves patients severely affected, but also demonstrates that possible side effects cannot be ignored. Review of the literature indicates the difficulty in interpretation of results due to a lack of objective evaluation. Nevertheless, stereotactic thalamotomy can still be recommended when tremor and rigidity are the most prominent symptoms. Stereotactic dentatotomies in the treatment of spasticity were very popular 20 years ago, but have been largely forgotten for nearly a decade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Baclofen (25 to 60 mg per day) and diazepam (10 to 40 mg per day) were evaluated for spasticity reduction in a double-blind, crossover study in 13 patients over a period of 19 weeks. Both drugs produced overall improvement and there was no significant difference in preference for one or other treatment. Side-effects, especially excessive daytime sedation, were more common in the diazepam group. In a companion baclofen long-term study, 18 spastic patients were treated with baclofen for an average of 4 years. Baclofen discontinuation in this group resulted in a worsening of spastic signs and symptoms in 16 patients, with no evidence of drug tolerance even after many years of baclofen therapy.", 
    "35": "Benzodiazepines are presently the most widely prescribed drugs. They are considered as safe drugs although there is appreciable evidence from animal experiments as well as from epidemiological evaluations that they act as teratogens. The pertinent literature is subjected to a synopsis with results from pharmacological, biochemical and behavioral research. Recent views of the mechanisms of teratogenic action serve to propose several points of attack where benzodiazepines can disturb the development of the central nervous system. This attack can take place during organogenesis, during early differentiation of neural anlagen after neural tube closure or during biochemical differentiation of the brain. It is suggested that intake of benzodiazepines at any time during pregnancy may result in visible malformations, in functional deficits or in behavioral anomalies of the exposed children.", 
    "36": "Recurrence rates of chronic duodenal ulcer after initial therapy with pirenzepine or cimetidine were investigated in a prospective, randomized trial with a total of 80 patients. After 12 weeks of therapy with pirenzepine (50 mg b.i.d) or cimetidine (200 mg t.i.d. + 400 mg nocte) 68,7% and 88,5% respectively were healed (chi 2 = 3,97; p less than 0,05). These patients showed recurrences in 73,6% after pirenzepine and in 84,6% after cimetidine during a six months observation period. This difference is not statistically significant, nor was life table analysis capable to show any difference in the relapse pattern between the two groups.", 
    "37": "One hundred and thirteen patients diagnosed as suffering from one of four common psychosomatic syndromes (psychogenic headache, cardiac neurosis, functional disturbance of the colon, or pruritus) were treated by two groups of general practitioners with flupenthixol or diazepam or sulpiride. Flupenthixol was compared with diazepam in 58 patients in one group of Belgian practices, and with sulpiride in 55 patients in another group of practices and assessed over a 4-week period for therapeutic response and adverse effects. Flupenthixol was given in a dosage of 0.5 to 2 mg a day, diazepam in a dosage of 2.5 to 10 mg a day and sulpiride 100 to 200 mg a day, in identical capsules. In the flupenthixol/diazepam comparison, there were 7 drop-outs (3 flupenthixol, 4 diazepam). Marked or moderate reduction in global assessment of illness occurred in both treatment groups, but there was no significant difference in the therapeutic effect of the two drugs. The incidence of side-effects was low and similar in the two groups. In the flupenthixol/sulpiride comparison, there were 10 drop-outs (7 flupenthixol, 3 sulpiride). A significant reduction in symptoms occurred in both treatment groups, but this was more rapid in the flupenthixol group. Side-effects were infrequent and mild in both groups.", 
    "38": "Seventy-one patients undergoing withdrawal from alcohol were randomly assigned to treatment with oral bromocriptine, chlormethiazole or chlordiazepoxide. Forty-one percent had alcoholic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis. Patients were stratified into two groups: major and minor withdrawal symptoms. The latter group included a placebo tratment. Bromocriptine was ineffective in treating withdrawal symptoms, whilst chlormethiazole and chlordiazepoxide were equally effective. These findings do not support the evidence from animal and clinical studies suggesting that the disturbances in the dopaminergic system found in alcohol dependence and withdrawal can be reversed by dopamine agonists.", 
    "39": "The interaction of phenylbutazone and diazepam with smectite were studied in in-vivo and in-vitro. The kinetics of both drugs were investigated in healthy subjects after oral administration as monotherapy or in association with smectite. Smectite did not substantially alter the kinetics of phenylbutazone, whereas the peak plasma concentration of diazepam was reduced to 91%, and the time of peak concentration was prolonged by 153% of the control values. The in-vitro investigations were conducted at pH 5.5 and 8 and showed that there was no interaction between phenylbutazone and smectite, but that it adsorbed diazepam. The findings suggest that smectite delays the absorption of basic drugs and does not alter the absorption kinetics of acidic drugs.", 
    "40": "Nine healthy volunteers in a double-blind, cross-over trial received diazepam (DZ) 10 mg, lorazepam (LZ) 2.5 mg, or placebo (P). Serum benzodiazepine (BZ) was bioassayed (radioreceptor method) and psychomotor tests were carried out on Day 1 (before and 1 h after the first dose) and on Day 4 (before and after the fifth dose). In each session alcohol 1 g/kg was administered 1.5 h after drug intake and the measurements were repeated twice. Serum BZ concentrations, expressed as DZ equivalents (microgram/l), ranged from 390 to 440 and from 990 to 1240 measured 2 h 45 min after the first doses of DZ and LZ, respectively. On Day 1 BZ alone impaired psychomotor skills. LZ affected performance more in objective tests, but DZ was subjectively rated as causing more drowsiness. After the intake of alcohol, all groups showed impairment in various tests. The rank order was LZ + alcohol greater than DZ + alcohol greater than P + alcohol. Residual BZ activity on Day 4, measured 18 h after the fourth dose, averaged 290 and 450 micrograms/l after DZ and LZ, respectively. At the same time slight residual exophoria was found after both BZs. Tolerance to BZs on Day 4 was unambiguous only when drug effects were related to the bioassayed serum levels. The combined action of BZs and alcohol was similar on Days 1 and 4. However, a tendency to an increased drug-alcohol interaction during advanced treatment with DZ was seen in the body sway test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "In a double-blind crossover trial, the hypnotic efficacy and acceptability of oxazepam Expidet, a fast-dissolving tablet, was compared to placebo in patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. Patients received 30 mg oxazepam Expidet or placebo the night before their operation and the alternate medication the night after. A sleep questionnaire was completed the morning after both nights and acceptability was assessed the morning after the second night. Data were available for analysis on seventy-two patients aged 18-50 years. There was a significant improvement in sleep onset and quality and less awakenings after oxazepam compared to placebo (p less than or equal to 0.01). There was no significant difference in the occurrence or type of dreams, or morning-after symptoms. There was a significant preference for oxazepam compared to placebo and for the fast-dissolving Expidet form compared to conventional tablets or capsules (p less than or equal to 0.01). There were no adverse reactions in the oxazepam group. It was concluded that oxazepam Expidet was an effective and acceptable hypnotic in this group of patients.", 
    "42": "Four hundred and thirty-four patients suffering from mild to moderate depression were recruited into a double-blind multicentre general practice study and randomly received either Limbitrol (25 mg amitriptyline and 10 mg chlordiazepoxide) or amitriptyline 25 mg in matching white capsules given as a single night-time dose. The dose was titrated to a maximum of four capsules per night. Patients were assessed on entry and at 7-day intervals for depressive state (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), cardiovascular effect and side-effects for 28 days. Self-assessments of depression and anxiety using the Leeds Scale were made in the form of a patient questionnaire. Both groups showed significant improvement at each visit and significantly more patients improved after 7 days in the Limbitrol group. There was no significant difference in treatment over all between groups, in the incidence of side-effects, or in the effects on the heart.", 
    "43": "A sequential sample of 101 patients hospitalized for ethanol withdrawal and requiring sedation for evolving withdrawal syndromes was assigned randomly according to a double-blind protocol to treatment with either alprazolam or chlordiazepoxide administered orally. The data from one patient were unevaluable due to acute bleeding, leaving a sample of 100 (50 in each condition). At discharge, three independent ratings of diaphoresis, tremor, hallucinations, nausea/vomiting, and overall severity of withdrawal were obtained, and the occurrence of delirium tremens and grand mal seizures was noted. Patients also completed the Beck Depression Inventory, and their disposition following discharge was recorded. There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups on any of the dependent variables studied. It was concluded that the choice between alprazolam and chlordiazepoxide for managing ethanol withdrawal should be based on criteria other than efficacy of control. Potential antidepressant effects and drug kinetics were suggested as the basis for rational decision-making.", 
    "44": "The growing experimental evidence that early developmental exposure to centrally acting drugs (particularly during a period of development defined by the presence of appropriate receptors) can induce persisting neural and functional alterations in the offspring necessitates a careful evaluation of this literature with respect to its relevancy to humans. The experimental evidence suggests that functional alterations will be selective and defined by the neurochemical anatomy of the specific sites upon which the drugs act. Additionally, functional alterations may not be expressed until well into childhood or later. A major problem consequent to prenatal drug exposure may be a difficulty for the organism to meet specific challenges. Such information should guide future clinical investigations.", 
    "45": "Fifty out-patients with an active, endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer were entered a double-blind trial of ranitidine + prazepam or ranitidine + placebo. Two drop-outs occurred in the prazepam group and 1 in the placebo group. After 28 days of treatment, the ulcer had healed in 95.6% of the patients on ranitidine + prazepam and 75% of the patients on ranitidine + placebo (p = 0.03). Sleepiness was the most frequent side effect, reported by 8 subjects in the prazepam group and by 1 subject in the placebo group. It is concluded that prazepam can be usefully combined with ranitidine in the short-term treatment of duodenal ulcer.", 
    "46": "The secretion of various pancreatic hormones (insulin, glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide) is affected to a different extent by the cholinergic system. In 7 healthy subjects the effects of treatment for 1 week with pirenzepine, an anticholinergic drug selective for muscarinic receptors, on basal secretion of these hormones and on that induced by i.v. glucose (IVGTT) and arginine were evaluated. The drug did not reduce basal levels of insulin and glucagon whereas it caused an appreciable reduction in basal pancreatic polypeptide (PP). The responses of insulin and blood glucose to IVGTT and to arginine were not changed by treatment, nor was that of plasma glucagon to arginine. The infusion of arginine did induce an increase in PP level, which reached a statistically significant maximum at 90 min. This response was not particularly different after administration of pirenzepine. Thus, the results confirm the finding that arginine stimulates PP secretion in vivo and that pirenzepine reduces the basal level of the hormone, whereas it did not appear to affect the response to arginine. The findings exclude any direct action of the drug on insulin or glucagon secretion or on glucose metabolism in general.", 
    "47": "A double-blind crossover trial was carried out on the sleep-inducing activity of a new preparation (oral drops) of lormetazepam versus placebo. Twenty patients were included and requested to subjectively evaluate their sleep, both by analogue scales and semiquantitative ratings, during 2-night administration of the two products. Also, the usual parameters, sleep duration, sleep latency and number of awakenings were evaluated. Lormetazepam drops appeared to exert the same actions as the capsules' preparation, being significantly different from those of the placebo.", 
    "48": "The general anesthetic course has been made acceptably safe with the development of modern anesthetic agents and techniques and increased capabilities for monitoring patient organ systems. Each area of surgery has features unique to its specialty. Consideration of these aspects when planning an anesthetic and surgical course, as well as the importance of the team effort, cannot be overemphasized.", 
    "49": "The effect of experimentally induced hyperinsulinemia on body composition was studied in rats with food intakes precisely controlled by intragastric feeding and physical activity manipulated by sedation with chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 38) were fitted surgically with gastrostomy tubes. After 8 days the animals were divided into four groups. Group 1 received daily injections of protamine-zinc insulin; group 2 received daily injections of saline; group 3 received the same insulin doses as group 1 plus daily administration of CDP mixed with the diet; group 4 received daily injections of saline plus CDP in the diet. All groups were tubefed identical amounts of semiliquid diet via gastrostomy. Physical activity was measured by electronic monitor. After 4 wk the rats were killed. The insulin-treated groups (1 and 3) had significantly larger fat depots and larger mean fat cell size than the noninsulin-treated groups (2 and 4). This increase in fat occurred concurrently with a decrease in carcass protein and water. Physical activity, as measured, was unaltered by insulin but was significantly reduced by CDP. Treatment with CDP only increased the dorsal fat depot and liver weight but had no significant effect on total dissected fat depots and had a reductive effect on carcass protein. In conclusion insulin treatment enhanced the efficiency of conversion of energy intake into fat energy stores.", 
    "50": "Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) injected intracerebroventricularly in doses from 15-150 pmoles (10-1000 nanograms) produced a prolonged locomotor activation in rats previously habituated to a test cage environment. This CRF activation persisted following hypophysectomy, opiate-receptor blockade and low dose dopamine receptor blockade suggesting a unique mechanism of action. In aversive, stressful situations such as a novel open field test and an operant conflict test CRF produced behavioral changes consistent with increased \"emotionality.\" In the rat conflict test, this \"anxiogenic\" effect of CRF could be reversed by low doses of the anti-anxiety drug chlordiazepoxide. These results suggest that CRF liberated directly into the central nervous system may have an endocoid action important for mobilizing behavioral responses to stress.", 
    "51": "The effects of premedication on anaesthesia with propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg were assessed. One hundred and twenty female patients were randomized into one of three groups of 40 who received either no premedication, diazepam 10 mg orally, or pethidine 50-75 mg intramuscularly (i.m.) and atropine 0.6 mg i.m. Propofol 2.5 mg/kg was found to be a reliable induction dose. Premedication did not affect the induction time nor the incidence of side effects which occurred in 19% of patients. Apnoea occurred in 44% of patients but was not related to premedication, nor was arterial hypotension. Pain on injection was rare in the antecubital fossa but was a frequent occurrence (30%) in the dorsum of the hand. Recovery was rapid and characterized by lack of emetic sequelae; only one patient had nausea and there was no vomiting. The site of injection was examined postoperatively and venous sequelae were rare.", 
    "52": "Patients undergoing coronary artery surgery run a certain risk of developing myocardial infarction in situations with increased myocardial oxygen demand due to e.g. elevations in heart rate and blood pressure. After cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) there is, however, also the risk of graft occlusion. The present study evaluated the haemodynamic effects of a sequential anaesthesiological technique using halothane 0.5-1.5% in combination with 50% nitrous oxide and droperidol 0.1 mg X kg b.w.-1 before CPB followed by fentanyl 0.2 mg X h-1 in continuous i.v. infusion and diazepam 10-15 mg during and after bypass. Fourteen patients were studied. In seven patients (Group I) halothane was discontinued immediately before CPB and in the following seven patients (Group II) 10-15 min before bypass. The aim was to depress moderately the inotropic state before bypass and to have a normalized myocardial oxygen demand after CPB in order to promote a good flow in the grafts. In Group II mean left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) was 0.54-0.79 J X m-2 after bypass as compared to 0.45-0.51 before at comparable filling pressure. Mean left ventricular power index (LVPI) increased from 0.42-0.55 W X m-2 before to 0.73-1.08 after CPB. The patients in Group I showed a similar pattern although with a less marked difference in LVSWI and LVPI values before and after bypass. No correlation was seen between oxygen delivery and oxygen uptake either below or above an oxygen delivery of 15 mmol X min-1 X m-2.", 
    "53": "The wake and sleep-onset times of a patient with a sleep-wake cycle longer than 24 hr were recorded by the patient for 4 years. During this time, the patient found himself unable to maintain a 24-hr sleep-wake schedule. When treated with 1-2 mg clonazepam, taken nightly, he was able to become entrained to a 24-hr day. Despite entrainment of his sleep-wake cycle, the patient reported depression, lack of motivation and fatigue and chose not to continue taking the drug.", 
    "54": "We studied metabolic, endocrine, and environmental factors in 59 women who had delivered a child with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL +/- CP) and compared these values with those of 56 mothers of unaffected children. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to race, age, weight, height, education, parity, menstrual history, medical illnesses, or the use of contraceptives, tobacco, alcohol, or caffeine. All patients had a normal XX karyotype confirmed by the fluorescent banding technique. The two groups demonstrated no significant difference in test results of serum chemistries, glucose tolerance, serum or erythrocyte folate, vitamin A, carotene, corticoids, prolactin T4, free T4, urine 17-ketosteroids, 17-hydroxysteroids, total estrogens, or pregnanediol. Urinalyses revealed no group differences in the presence of barbiturates, amphetamines, salicylates, or benzodiazepines. The percentage of immunologic studies reflecting susceptibility to toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalic inclusion disease, and herpes was not different between the two groups. The only statistically significant metabolic differences between the two groups were serum alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, creatinine clearance, and creatinine clearance/m2. Phenytoin pharmacokinetics and urinary metabolic patterns were compared in a subgroup of ten mothers of affected children and ten mothers from the control group. No significant differences were observed. However, a brief course of phenytoin treatment induced a greater inhibition of the folate tolerance test in controls than in mothers of children with clefts.", 
    "55": "Acute toxicity testing in-vivo seeks a new approach minimising the number of animals used and increasing the number of quantitative and qualitative observations. The measurement of grip strength of mice (forelimbs), a classical tool for the evaluation of muscular force and the emitted heat measurement, as a tool for evaluation of basic metabolism, have been used. The aim of acute toxicity was, up to now, to determine LD50 level or eventually a minimal lethal dose. These non-invasive tests give an idea of general health condition and allow the determination of the minimal toxic dose while in the search for the minimal lethal dose. A computer-assisted grip strength test and an infrared thermometry test have been developed and calibrated with Na+ pentobarbital, theophylline and diazepam given once orally or intraperitoneally to 10 male NMRI (MAI) mice/dose. The tests were performed within one hour after administration and daily until the values of the surviving animals went back to normal. Dose-response curves were obtained and plotted against control animals (n = 10). Oral and intraperitoneal administration in ascending doses of Na+-pentobarbital, theophylline and diazepam (i.p. only) up to the lethal level have a parallel influence on grip strength and heat emission; the correlation with mortality is clear for Na+-pentobarbital and diazepam but not for theophylline.", 
    "56": "Patients suffering from depression (mostly depressive neurosis) were admitted to a double-blind study which compared the efficacy of a combination of nomifensine and clobazam with mianserin. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression Scale, physician's assessments, Global Improvement and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale for side-effects. Assessments were made before admission to the trial and on days 3, 7, 14 and 21. Forty patients were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. A case is made against polypharmacy and in particular against the use of benzodiazepine combinations in depression. Nineteen patients on nomifensine-clobazam and 14 on mianserin completed the three-week trial. At 7, 14 and 21 days, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total scores were significantly improved for mianserin when compared with nomifensine-clobazam. Similarly, at 7 and 14 days the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) total scores were significantly better for mianserin than for the nomifensine-clobazam combination. There were also significant improvements for mianserin on the HDRS sub-scales of anxiety somatization, cognitive disturbance and sleep disturbance. There were no significant differences for HDRS somatic symptoms between treatment groups. Drowsiness was the most common side-effect in both groups. The incidence of total side-effects was 74% for nomifensine-clobazam and 71% for the mianserin group.", 
    "57": "There have been recent findings of gastric cancer in patients treated with cimetidine but too soon after treatment for that drug to have had a pathogenetic role. Ranitidine has been shown to induce slight changes in the gastric mucosa. In 117 patients with gastric ulcer followed-up in some cases for 24 months, five cases of cancer were detected, one after more than a year of follow-up. The numbers were too small to allow any conclusion to be drawn regarding relationships with medication. No significant differences in incidence of gastric epithelial dysplasia between control patients and patients treated with cimetidine or ranitidine were found. No dysplastic lesions were seen during a brief follow-up of 19 duodenal ulcer patients and a few gastric ulcer patients treated with pirenzepine but the data is too limited to allow conclusions to be drawn.", 
    "58": "A benzodiazepine drug, clobazam, was evaluated in 14 refractory epileptic patients, nine of whom received the drug double-blind. Ten patients have been given clobazam long enough to assess results. Four showed marked benefit, four failed to respond and two showed a transient benefit which was maintained by dose changes of both clobazam and clonazepam. Side effects were minimal; doses ranged from 15 to 60 mg per day. Clobazam may have place in the treatment of the Lennox Gastaut syndrome and other types of refractory seizures.", 
    "59": "Both prednisone and cytostatic drugs have an ulcerogenic effect on digestive mucosa. The protective action of the antisecretory drugs pirenzepine and ranitidine are compared against gastroduodenal lesions induced by antiblastic therapy. Twenty patients affected with lymphoproliferative disorders were endoscopically examined: none of them suffered from gastric or duodenal peptic ulcers or erosions. Ten out of the 20 patients received pirenzepine 100 mg/die/p.o. and the other 10 received ranitidine 300 mg/die/p.o. The study was performed according to a double-blind, randomized sequence. The antisecretory medication was administered together with antitumoral therapy for periods of 3-6 months. Four patients died of haematological complications before the course of treatment was completed. A further endoscopic examination was performed at the end of treatment: no patient showed evidence of gastric or duodenal peptic ulcers or erosions. Among the pirenzepine-treated cases, 1 out of the 7 evaluable patients showed a histological worsening of a pre-existing gastritis, while a slight duodenitis was observed in 1 out of the 9 ranitidine-treated patients. The comparable effectiveness of the two drugs is probably related to their antisecretory action, but cytoprotective mechanisms cannot be excluded.", 
    "60": "The novel antimuscarinic compound pirenzepine (PZ) has generated considerable interest in the basis and the implications of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) heterogeneity. [3H]PZ has been used extensively to identify and characterize the putative M1 (high affinity for PZ) mAChR subtype, which predominates in central nervous system (CNS) and ganglia. The heterogeneity sensed by PZ is not identical to the heterogeneity sensed by agonists. Differences in effector coupling do not necessarily provide a simple explanation for the molecular basis of these putative M1 and M2 subtypes. Therapeutic and untoward effects of muscarinic drugs may be mediated by independent mAChR subpopulations which may be pharmacologically exploited to produce more highly selective as well as efficacious new drugs.", 
    "61": "The muscarinic cholinergic innervation of the rat gastric mucosa was investigated by localizing the muscarinic receptors using a tritiated muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine. Radioautography was performed by freeze drying stomach tissue, which was then embedded in Epon and wet sectioned with ethylene glycol, and dry mounting on emulsion film by the wire-loop method to prevent loss of the labelled substance during fixation and the radioautographic procedure. Light and electron microscopy showed that the specific pirenzepine-binding sites were localized predominantly on parietal cells, chief cells and perivascular plexuses. Analysis of the grain distribution on parietal cells revealed that the silver grains corresponding to the pirenzepine-binding sites were mainly on the basolateral plasma membrane. On the other hand, the surface mucous or mucous neck cells had few pirenzepine-binding sites.", 
    "62": "Several compounds acting on the cholinergic system at different levels were tested for their stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the isolated lower esophageal sphincter (LES) of the rat. Results obtained with acetylcholine, bethanechol and compound McN-A343 on the one hand and atropine, pirenzepine, ganglion blocking agents and tetrodotoxin on the other, suggested that LES contraction was associated mainly with the stimulation of post-synaptic muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors (both ganglionic and muscular) seem to have a minor role, if any.", 
    "63": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of atropine with those of placebo and pirenzepine on food-induced gastrin release, and gastric and acid secretion. Three groups of subjects were studied: 8 healthy volunteers; 8 duodenal ulcer patients, and 6 vagotomized patients. Gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin were studied in each subject on 3 different days, after placebo, atropine or pirenzepine, given in random order. In each group, acid secretion was significantly depressed by atropine and pirenzepine. Unlike pirenzepine, atropine induced a significantly increase in serum gastrin in both healthy volunteers and duodenal ulcer patients. None of the treatments caused differences in gastrin response in vagotomized patients.", 
    "64": "Analgesia and sedation for patients in intensive care units (ICU) who require mechanical ventilation are most commonly provided by intermittent i.v. injections of opiates and benzodiazepines. However, the technique has a number of disadvantages. Also, in many cases these drugs are inadequate, even in large doses, and muscle relaxants may be necessary for patient respirator coordination. The analgesic effect of epidural and intrathecal morphine was studied in 24 ICU patients requiring controlled ventilation. In spite of large doses of phenoperidine, diazepam and a number of other analgesics and sedatives, all patients were restless, agitated and coordinated poorly with the respirator. Through an indwelling epidural catheter morphine (4 mg) was injected intermittently as required in 11 patients and as a continuous infusion (20-40 mg/day) in five patients. In eight patients morphine (2-4 mg) was injected intrathecally as a single injection. Both epidural and intrathecal morphine gave potent analgesia and good patient respirator coordination. The duration of analgesia was shortest after intermittent injections of epidural morphine and longest after intrathecal morphine. However, continuous infusion of morphine in the epidural catheter appears to be the most practical method. In patients with multiple trauma and in patients where frequent assessment of the level of consciousness is important this technique is superior to parenteral analgesic sedative combinations. Intrathecal morphine may be indicated in patients in a compromised position. The daily analgesic requirement can be reduced by about 10-100 times by the use of epidural and intrathecal morphine respectively.", 
    "65": "We studied the effects of atropine and pirenzepine on acid secretion induced by electrical vagal stimulation (EVS) and on healing of gastric ulcers after mucosal excision in rats. Both atropine (50, 125, and 250 micrograms/kg/hr) and pirenzepine (2.5, 5.0, and 12.5 mg/kg/hr), administered intraperitoneally, inhibited vagally stimulated acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Pirenzepine given at a rate of 0.25 mg/kg/hr had no effect on the acid secretory response to EVS. Either atropine (125 micrograms/kg/hr) or pirenzepine (2.5 mg/kg/hr) given for one week caused an inhibition of approximately 80% in acid secretory response to EVS. The antisecretory dosage of pirenzepine caused a significant reduction in the surface area of the ulcer by the seventh postoperative day, whereas neither the antisecretory dosage of atropine nor the nonantisecretory dosage of pirenzepine significantly affected the size of the ulcer. We conclude that an antisecretory dosage of pirenzepine accelerates the healing of gastric ulcers produced in rats.", 
    "66": "Using the classical muscarinic antagonist 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine as radioligand and unlabelled pirenzepine (PZ) as displacing agent, a heterogeneous muscarinic receptor population consisting of about 70% M1-receptors and 30% M2-receptor, can be demonstrated in crude membranes of calf sympathetic ganglia. In the same preparation only low and variable specific binding is detectable when 3H-PZ is used as marker ligand. The situation clearly improves when synaptosomes are prepared from the ganglia. Then binding of 3H-PZ can be measured with a favourable specific to non specific binding ratio and with features compatible with the selective labelling of ganglionic M1-receptor sites. It is concluded that the 3H-PZ binding assay in synaptosomes of autonomic ganglia is a novel method for the characterization of the peripheral M1-receptor.", 
    "67": "Longitudinal muscle strips of the guinea-pig ileum were incubated with [3H]choline and the effects of muscarinic agonists on smooth muscle contraction and on spontaneous and electrically-evoked outflow of tritium were studied. Muscarine and pilocarpine concentration-dependently increased both muscle contraction and spontaneous outflow of [3H]ACh, and inhibited the electrically-evoked outflow of [3H]ACh. The increase in spontaneous outflow was prevented by tetrodotoxin and scopolamine, but not by hexamethonium. Oxotremorine (1-100 microM) did not increase the spontaneous outflow of tritium. Pirenzepine in concentrations of 10 and 100 nM hardly affected the muscle contractions induced by pilocarpine, but significantly antagonized the pilocarpine-evoked increases in [3H]ACh outflow. Likewise, pirenzepine (100 nM) antagonized more effectively the enhancement by muscarine of spontaneous outflow than the inhibitory effect of muscarine on the electrically-evoked release of [3H]ACh. Scopolamine (1 and 10 nM) antagonized to a similar extent the effects of pilocarpine on spontaneous outflow of [3H]ACh and on muscle contraction. The results suggest that the cholinergic nerves of the myenteric plexus are endowed with excitatory (ganglionic) and inhibitory (prejunctional) muscarine receptors which modulate the release of ACh and which differ in their affinities to pirenzepine.", 
    "68": "The muscarinic receptor mediating vasodilatation of the rabbit aorta and dog femoral artery has been assessed using muscarinic antagonists. With the exception of pirenzepine, the antagonist affinities were similar to those reported for the ileal receptors and dissimilar to those reported for the atrial receptors. Pirenzepine exhibited an affinity (7.54) intermediate between that reported for the CNS receptors (8.4) and that reported for the ileal receptors (6.77). This value for pirenzepine was confirmed using acetylcholine as the agonist and using the dog femoral artery as the vascular tissue. It is concluded that the muscarinic receptor profile mediating vasodilatation is not easily accommodated into the current receptor classification.", 
    "69": "The Computer-Automated Structure Evaluation Program, a new expert system capable of automatically developing relevant descriptors for structure-activity relationships, has been used to analyze experimental anticonvulsant activity data of a series of 1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one derivatives. Some significant correlations are observed between the activity of 99 benzodiazepines against pentylenetetrazole and some relevant molecular fragments identified by the program. The utility of the observed relationships and the predictive power of the method are discussed.", 
    "70": "The relationship between structure, in vivo activity, and in vitro activity of some analogues of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist piperidine-4-sulphonic acid (P4S) was studied. The syntheses of 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-sulphonic acid (DH-P4S) and (RS)-pyrrolidin-3-yl-methanesulphonamide (PMSA-amide) are described. Like P4S, its unsaturated analogue DH-P4S and the five-ring isomer (RS)-pyrrolidin-3-yl-methanesulphonic acid (PMSA) were bicuculline methochloride (BMC)-sensitive inhibitors of the firing of neurones in the cat spinal cord. Whereas isonipecotic acid was less potent than its unsaturated analogue isoguvacine as a GABA-mimetic and as an inhibitor of GABA binding, the opposite relative potencies of P4S and DH-P4S were observed, P4S being proportionally more potent than DH-P4S. In contrast with P4S and DH-P4S, PMSA, which is an analogue of the potent GABA uptake inhibitor and BMC-sensitive GABA-mimetic homo-beta-proline, was a relatively weak inhibitor of GABA uptake in vitro. PMSA-amide was more than two orders of magnitude weaker than PMSA as an inhibitor of GABA binding and did not significantly affect GABA uptake in vitro. The effects of 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid (3-APS), PMSA, P4S, and DH-P4S on the binding of [3H]diazepam in vitro at 30 degrees C, in the presence or absence of chloride ions, were studied and compared with those of the structurally related amino acids GABA, homo-beta-proline, isonipecotic acid, and isoguvacine. Under these conditions the aminosulphonic acids were weaker than the respective amino acids in enhancing [3H]diazepam binding, the difference being more pronounced in the absence of chloride.", 
    "71": "The pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs used for the treatment of human epilepsies is reviewed for dogs and cats. In dogs, especially phenobarbital and primidone must be regarded as useful drugs for chronic treatment on account of their elimination rate and bioavailability. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid and benzodiazepines are eliminated so rapidly that a therapeutic value cannot be expected. In cats, phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid and diazepam must be regarded as suited for chronic treatment, but there is a definite lack of clinical experience. Phenobarbital and primidone are useful for treatment of clonic-tonic generalized seizures (grand mal) in dogs. The effect of primidone depends mostly on its metabolite phenobarbital. Since primidone, given in high dosage for longer periods of time, gives rise to liver damage, phenobarbital is regarded as the drug of first choice. A status epilepticus may be treated by i.v. injection of diazepam, clonazepam, phenytoin or lidocaine. In cats with grand mal, treatment with daily doses of about 1 mg/kg diazepam may be tried. It proved effective for longer time periods without development of tolerance. There is no reliable clinical experience with other drugs in this species.", 
    "72": "A technique for the management of pain and anxiety during pacemaker implantation, electrophysiologic studies, and related procedures is described. The technique involves the intravenous administration of small amounts of the narcotic agonist-antagonist nalbuphine and the benzodiazepine diazepam. The small amounts of medication used induce relaxation while allowing the patient to interact and cooperate during the procedure. The absence of side effects facilitates outpatient treatment. This method of pain management not only improves the quality of patient care but also encourages earlier hospital discharge.", 
    "73": "Sixty patients (age-range one month to 14 years) with other types of epilepsy than infantile spasms were treated with clonazepam. Disappearance of seizures and normalization of abnormal EEG with disappearance of seizures were recognized in 77% and 50%, respectively. Seizures disappeared in 71% of the patients with generalized seizures and 89% of partial seizures. Improvement of abnormal EEG was noticed in 76% of diffuse paroxysms and in 67% of focal paroxysms. In excellent cases, mean effective dosages were 0.086 +/- 0.021 mg/kg/day in infants and 0.057 +/- 0.022 mg/kg/day in schoolchildren, this difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.005). The incidence of side effects such as drowsiness and ataxia was only 5%.", 
    "74": "Clonazepam, a unique benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant and serotonin enhancing capacity, can be used in conjunction with conventional psychopharmacologic agents to treat a variety of psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and psychotic mania. Three representative case studies are presented and specific guidelines for the use of clonazepam are discussed.", 
    "75": "The effect of the duration of isolation periods on the development of tolerance to sodium barbital was studied in mice. The HD50 values for pentobarbital-induced hypnosis were higher in all mice that were long-term treated with sodium pentobarbital, whether or not they were isolated or in groups. Diazepam HD50s were higher in mice isolated and long-term treated with sodium barbital for 38 days and in grouped animals treated with the barbiturate for 20 and 30 days. Social isolation for 8 weeks plus 23 days increased the pentobarbital hypnotic dose (HD50). These data show that social isolation increased the rate of tolerance acquisition to sodium barbital by mice.", 
    "76": "The article describes analytical data for the detection of midazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam, 4-hydroxymidazolam and alpha, 4-dihydroxymidazolam, as well as important pharmacokinetic properties. Extraction from biological specimens is also reported.", 
    "77": "Gas-chromatographically determined serum concentrations of midazolam were recorded before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients scheduled for a coronary artery bypass grafting operation. Following single 0.075 mg/kg (n = 6) and 0.15 mg/kg (n = 6) intravenous injections of midazolam, a mean distribution phase half-life of 3.4 and 4.4 min respectively was calculated. At the establishment of the bypass, a rapid drop in the concentration of midazolam was observed followed by a significant increase in concentration during the postperfusion period. The apparent mean elimination phase half-life (281 min) of midazolam was longer than that (about 120 min) measured in earlier works in young, healthy subjects. Thus the metabolism of midazolam during the postperfusion period appears to be slower.", 
    "78": "Seventy Syrian golden hamsters bearing SC transplants of Greene melanoma were used to evaluate the degree of tumour uptake of several 11C-radiopharmaceuticals selected for their potential specificity for melanoma. Tissue distribution studies were performed at 30 and 60 min after IV injection of 11C-compounds and compared with the 24-h uptake of 67Ga-citrate. Gamma camera images were also compared. The highest tumour uptake at 1 h was observed with 11C-methionine (2.42% +/- 0.72%) and although activity in liver, spleen and kidney exceeded that in melanoma the tumour was demonstrated on gamma camera imaging. Melanoma localisation of 11C-chlorpromazine, 11C-flunitrazepam and 11C-ketanserine was comparable at 1% of the dose injected per gram of tumour. High activity in other organs, particularly liver, exceeded uptake in melanoma and attempts at tumour imaging were unsuccessful. Tumour accumulation of 11C-methiodide quinuclidinyl benzylate (MQNB), an 11C-imidazobenzodiazepine (Ro-15-1788) and 14C-pimozide was low and imaging studies were not attempted. None of the 11C-radiopharmaceuticals evaluated for melanoma affinity matched that of 67Ga-citrate. The 24-h tumour uptake of 67Ga-citrate was 4.07% +/- 1.37% dose injected per gram which allowed delineation of the melanoma by gamma camera imaging."
