    "0": "Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder related to hypo-functioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission. N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDA-R) positive modulators were reported to reduce schizophrenia symptoms. However, their efficacy is low and inconsistent. We developed a novel antipsychotic possessing an olanzapine moiety linked to the positive modulator of glutamate NMDA-R sarcosine (PGW5) and characterized the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel molecule in-vivo using MK-801 and in-vitro using receptor binding analysis. We investigated the pharmacological activity of PGW5 (olanzapine linked to sarcosinyl moiety) in male mice (BALB/c or C57BL). In an open field test, up to 50mg/kg PGW5 did not affect motility while higher doses were sedative. PGW5 (25-50mg/kg po) antagonized MK-801 (0.15 mg/kg ip) and amphetamine-induced (5mg/kg ip) hyperactivity. PGW5 (25mg/kg po/d) treatment for 15 or 22 days exhibited antidepressant and anxiolytic activity in mice. Moreover, PGW5, but not olanzapine, attenuated phencyclidine (PCP)-induced deficits of social preference in mice and promoted the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in the hippocampus. Mice treated with PGW5 (25 and 50mg/kg/d) for 28 days did not show toxic effects in terms of weight gain and blood-chemistry analysis.", 
    "1": "PGW5 is a novel and safe antipsychotic, efficacious against schizophrenia-like positive and negative symptoms at nonsedative doses. The drug shows anxiolytic and antidepressant activity, and improves impaired social performance in phencyclidine (PCP) treated mice. The mechanism underlying its activity seems to involve potentiation of NMDA receptor as well as stimulation of brain BDNF and GAD67 expression.", 
    "2": "A man in his twenties was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his late teens. The night before his death, his family reported he drank a large amount of water, vomited, collapsed, and snored loudly while sleeping, but they did not view the event seriously as he did it routinely. The following morning, he was found dead. Autopsy revealed hyponatremia by water intoxication as the cause of death. Water intoxication has various causes. In this case, 610 ng/mL olanzapine was detected in serum samples. Although this concentration is not as high as the fatal concentrations reported in past studies, it might have caused some adverse effects. Furthermore, the observation that excessive drinking behavior started after the dose of olanzapine was increased suggests a possibility that olanzapine aggravated water intoxication.", 
    "3": "Recent evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might be linked with adverse cardiac events, but a causal relationship is unproven.", 
    "4": "We applied the self-matched case series method to two studies using population-based health care data from Ontario, Canada between 1996 and 2008. The first included subjects aged 66 years or older hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction within 12 weeks following initiation of PPI, while the second included subjects hospitalized for heart failure. In both studies we designated the primary risk interval as the initial 4 weeks of therapy and the control interval as the final 4 weeks. To test the specificity of our findings we examined use of histamine H2 receptor antagonists and benzodiazepines, drugs with no plausible causal link to adverse cardiac events.", 
    "5": "During the 13-year study period, we identified 5550 hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and 6003 admissions for heart failure within 12 weeks of commencing PPI therapy. In the main analyses, we found that initiation of a PPI was associated with a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 1.9) and heart failure (odds ratio 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 1.9). However, secondary analyses revealed similar risk estimates histamine H2 receptor antagonists and benzodiazepines, drugs with no known or suspected association with adverse cardiac events.", 
    "6": "PPIs are associated with a short-term risk of adverse cardiac events, but similar associations are seen with other drugs exhibiting no known cardiac toxicity. Collectively these observations suggest that the association between PPIs and adverse cardiac events does not represent reflect cause-and-effect.", 
    "7": "It is well accepted that insulin-induced hypoglycemia can result in seizures. However, the effects of the seizures, as well as possible treatment strategies, have yet to be elucidated, particularly in juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Here we establish a model of diabetes in young rats, to examine the consequences of severe hypoglycemia in this age group; particularly seizures and mortality. Diabetes was induced in post-weaned 22-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by streptozotocin (STZ) administered intraperitoneally (IP). Insulin IP (15 U/kg), in rats fasted (14-16 hours), induced hypoglycemia, defined as <3.5 mM blood glucose (BG), in 68% of diabetic (STZ) and 86% of control rats (CON). Seizures occurred in 86% of STZ and all CON rats that reached hypoglycemic levels with mortality only occurring post-seizure. The fasting BG levels were significantly higher in STZ (12.4 \u00b1 1.3 mM) than in CON rodents (6.3 \u00b1 0.3 mM), resulting in earlier onset of hypoglycemia and seizures in the CON group. However, the BG at seizure onset was statistically similar between STZ (1.8 \u00b1 0.2 mM) and CON animals (1.6 \u00b1 0.1 mM) as well as between those that survived (S+S) and those that died (S+M) post-seizure. Despite this, the S+M group underwent a significantly greater number of seizure events than the S+S group. 25% glucose administered at seizure onset and repeated with recurrent seizures was not sufficient to mitigate these continued convulsions. Combining glucose with diazepam and phenytoin significantly decreased post-treatment seizures, but not mortality. Intracranial electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded in 10 CON and 9 STZ animals. Predictive EEG changes were not observed in these animals that underwent seizures. Fluorojade staining revealed damaged cells in non-seizing STZ animals and in STZ and CON animals post-seizure. In summary, this model of hypoglycemia and seizures in juvenile diabetic rats provides a paradigm for further study of underlying mechanisms. Our data demonstrate that severe hypoglycemia (<2.0 mM) is a necessary precondition for seizures, and the increased frequency of these seizures is associated with mortality.", 
    "8": "In most western industrialised countries, second generation (atypical) antipsychotics are recommended as first-line drug treatments for people with schizophrenia. In this review, we specifically examine how the efficacy and tolerability of one such agent - aripiprazole - differs from that of other comparable second generation antipsychotics.",

The overall number of participants leaving studies early was 30% to 40%, limiting validity (no differences between groups).When compared with clozapine, there were no significant differences for global state (no clinically significant response, n = 2132, 29 RCTs, low quality evidence); mental state (BPRS, n = 426, 5 RCTs, very low quality evidence); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 240, 3 RCTs, very low quality evidence). Quality of life score using the WHO-QOL-100 scale demonstrated significant difference, favouring aripiprazole (n = 132, 2 RCTs, RR 2.59 CI 1.43 to 3.74, very low quality evidence). General extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were no different between groups (n = 520, 8 RCTs,very low quality evidence). No study reported general functioning or service use.When compared with quetiapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 991, 12 RCTs, low quality evidence); mental state (PANSS positive symptoms, n = 583, 7 RCTs, very low quality evidence); leaving the study early for any reason (n = 168, 2 RCTs, very low quality evidence), or general EPS symptoms (n = 348, 4 RCTs, very low quality evidence). Results were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for quality of life (WHO-QOL-100 total score, n = 100, 1 RCT, MD 2.60 CI 1.31 to 3.89, very low quality evidence). No study reported general functioning or service use.When compared with risperidone, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 6381, 80 RCTs, low quality evidence); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 1239, 12 RCTs, very low quality evidence). Data were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for improvement in mental state using the BPRS (n = 570, 5 RCTs, MD 1.33 CI 2.24 to 0.42, very low quality evidence); with higher adverse effects seen in participants receiving risperidone of general EPS symptoms (n = 2605, 31 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.31 to 0.50, low quality evidence).

Weight gain was significantly greater in people receiving aripiprazole (n = 232, 3 RCTs, RR 4.01 CI 1.10 to 14.60, very low quality evidence). No study reported general functioning, quality of life or service use.When compared with olanzapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 1739, 11 RCTs, very low quality evidence); mental state using PANSS (n = 1500, 11 RCTs, very low quality evidence); or quality of life using the GQOLI-74 scale (n = 68, 1 RCT, very low quality of evidence). Significantly more people receiving aripiprazole left the study early due to any reason (n = 2331, 9 RCTs, RR 1.15 CI 1.05 to 1.25, low quality evidence) and significantly more people receiving olanzapine gained weight (n = 1538, 9 RCTs, RR 0.25 CI 0.15 to 0.43, very low quality evidence). None of the included studies provided outcome data for the comparisons of 'service use' or 'general functioning'.", 
    "14": "Information on all comparisons is of limited quality, is incomplete and problematic to apply clinically. The quality of the evidence is all low or very low.

Long-term data are sparse and there is considerable scope for another update of this review as new data emerge from ongoing larger, independent pragmatic trials.", 
    "15": "The risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) rises with increasing age. In the field of ADRs, drug-nutrient interactions (DNIs) are a relatively unexplored area. More knowledge will contribute to the simple prevention of this type of ADR. As the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly is high, the primary objective of this review is to evaluate the literature on the relationship between drug use and vitamin D status, focusing on medicines commonly used by the elderly. PubMed was searched for human epidemiological and clinical studies published until early 2013, investigating the relationship between vitamin D blood levels and use of drugs from one of the following groups: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), biguanides, vitamin K antagonists, platelet aggregation inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, statins, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants. A total of 63 publications were identified. Thiazide diuretics, statins, and calcium channel blocking agents were the most frequently studied drug groups. Associations between thiazides and vitamin D were mixed (n = 22), statins had no or positive associations (n = 16) and calcium blockers were not associated or were negatively associated with vitamin D (n = 10). In conclusion, several knowledge gaps exist on the relationship between drug use and vitamin D blood levels. Available data are scarce (particularly for the aged), study characteristics are highly variable, and found associations may be confounded by, amongst other things, the underlying disease. Nonetheless, this review provides a basis for future research on ADRs that contribute to nutrient deficiencies.", 
    "16": "Ingesting ethanol (EtOH) at low doses during social drinking is a common human behavior for its facilitating effects on social interactions. However, low-dose EtOH may have also detrimental effects that so far are underexplored. Here we sought to test the effects of low-dose EtOH on long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in human motor cortex. Previous cellular experiments showed that low-dose EtOH potentiates extrasynaptic GABAAR and reduces NMDAR-mediated currents, processes that would limit the expression of LTP. Paired associative transcranial magnetic stimulation (PASLTP) was employed in nine healthy subjects for induction of LTP-like plasticity, indexed by a long-term increase in motor-evoked potential input-output curves. Synaptic \u03b11-GABAAR function was measured by saccadic peak velocity (SPV). Very low doses of EtOH (resulting in blood concentrations of <5 mM) suppressed LTP-like plasticity but did not affect SPV when compared with a placebo condition. In contrast, 1 mg of alprazolam, a classical benzodiazepine, or 10 mg of zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, decreased SPV but did not significantly affect LTP-like plasticity when compared with placebo. This double dissociation of low-dose EtOH vs alprazolam/zolpidem effects is best explained by the putatively high affinity of EtOH but not alprazolam/zolpidem to extrasynaptic GABAARs and to NMDARs. Findings suggest that enhancement of extrasynaptic GABAAR-mediated tonic inhibition and/or reduction of NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission by EtOH blocks LTP-like plasticity in human cortex at very low doses that are easily reached during social drinking. Therefore, low-dose EtOH may jeopardize LTP-dependent processes, such as learning and memory formation.", 
    "17": "Sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis is a powerful and essential tool for metabolite identification in drug discovery and development. An MS(2) (or tandem, MS/MS) mass spectrum is acquired from the fragmentation of a precursor ion by multiple methods including information-dependent acquisition (IDA), SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra), and MS(All) (also called MS(E)) techniques. We compared these three techniques in their capabilities to produce comprehensive MS(2) data by assessing both metabolite MS(2) acquisition hit rate and the quality of MS(2) spectra. Rat liver microsomal incubations from eight test compounds were analyzed with four methods (IDA, MMDF (multiple mass defect filters)-IDA, SWATH, or MS(All)) using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-qudrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF MS) platform. A combined total of 227 drug-related materials (DRM) were detected from all eight test article incubations, and among those, 5% and 4% of DRM were not triggered for MS(2) acquisition with IDA and MMDF-IDA methods, respectively. When the same samples were spiked to an equal volume of blank rat urine (urine sample), the DRM without MS(2) acquisition increased to 29% and 18%, correspondingly. In contrast, 100% of DRM in both matrixes were subjected to MS(2) acquisition with either the SWATH or MS(All) method. However, the quality of the acquired MS(2) spectra decreased in the order of IDA, SWATH, and MS(All) methods. An average of 10, 9, and 6 out of 10 most abundant ions in MS(2) spectra were the real product ions of DRM detected in microsomal samples from IDA, SWATH, and MS(All) methods, respectively. The corresponding numbers declined to 9, 6, and 3 in the urine samples. Overall, IDA-based methods acquired qualitatively better MS(2) spectra but with a lower MS(2) acquisition hit rate than the other two methods. SWATH outperformed the MS(All) method given its better quality of MS(2) spectra with an identical MS(2) acquisition hit rate.", 
    "18": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent chronic condition. It causes discomfort in the lower limbs with an urge to move the legs and sometimes paresthesias. It's frequently associated with sleep and mood disorders causing a significant impact on quality of life. There are four clinical criteria to diagnose it. Treatment includes management of reversible factors and if needed symptomatic treatment. Depending on symptoms severity, non-drug measures can be tried. First-line medication treatment should be dopaminergic agonists. Second-line treatments include, anticonvulsivants (gabapentine), benzodiazepine (clonazepam) or opioids based on predominant symptoms. Difficult cases should be referred to a specialist.", 
    "19": "Research was conducted on ventilated patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) under identical circumstances; patients were divided into two groups (subsequently proved statistically identical as to age and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II [SAPS II]). One group was treated with positive suggestions for 15-20 min a day based on a predetermined scheme, but tailored to the individual patient, while the control group received no auxiliary psychological treatment. Our goal was to test the effects of positive communication in this special clinical situation. In this section of the research, the subsequent data collection was aimed to reveal whether any change in drug need could be demonstrated upon the influence of suggestions as compared to the control group. Owing to the strict recruitment criteria, a relatively small sample (suggestion group n = 15, control group n = 10) was available during the approximately nine-month period of research. As an outcome of suggestions, there was a significant drop in benzodiazepine (p < 0.005), opioid (p < 0.001), and the \u03b12-agonist (p < 0.05) intake. All this justifies the presence of therapeutic suggestions among the therapies used in ICUs. However, repeating the trial on a larger sample of patients would be recommended.", 
    "20": "Anaesthesia is required for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (A-fib) to achieve patient comfort and immobilization to avoid map shifts. This study compared the analgesic and sedative efficacies of dexmedetomidine-remifentanil with those of midazolam-remifentanil for catheter ablation of A-fib.", 
    "21": "Ninety patients were randomized to receive either intermittent midazolam boluses (1-2 mg) with 3.6-7.2 \u00b5g/kg/h of remifentanil (MR group) or dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 \u00b5g/kg/h after a loading dose of 1 \u00b5g/kg with 1.2-2.4 \u00b5g/kg/h of remifentanil (DR group). The sedation level assessed by the Ramsay sedation and bispectral index scores, haemodynamic variables, pain score (10-point numerical scale), and satisfaction levels of the patients and cardiologists (5-point numerical scale) were recorded. The Ramsay sedation score was significantly higher, and the bispectral index score was lower in the DR group (P< 0.001) compared with the MR group starting 10 min after drug administration. The incidence of desaturation (SpO2 < 90%) was significantly greater in the MR group compared with the DR group (15 vs. 1, P < 0.001). The pain score was significantly lower (1.72 \u00b1 1.65 vs. 0.95 \u00b1 1.10, P = 0.021), and the satisfaction levels of interventionists were significantly higher (2.50 \u00b1 0.71 vs. 3.00 \u00b1 0.63, P = 0.001) in the DR group compared with the MR group.", 
    "22": "The combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil provided deeper sedation, less respiratory depression, better analgesia, and higher satisfaction for the interventionist during catheter ablation of A-fib compared with midazolam plus remifentanil, even at a lower dose of remifentanil.", 
    "23": "Rates of illicit drug use and drug-related deaths have continuously increased in developed countries since the 1960s even though the patterns of use and thus the related mortality differ from region to region. In Europe heroin is the drug most often implicated in overdoses. The decedents are most often male, between 20 and 30 years of age and have a long history of drug use. According to the majority of available studies a concomitant use of alcohol and benzodiazepines is one of the risk factors of heroin overdose. In our study we have examined the basic demographic and toxicological features of illicit drug related death cases in Budapest, Hungary between 1994 and 2012. Drug overdose death cases have been divided into two subgroups according to the substances responsible for the death of the subjects: an opioid group and a non-opioid group. The huge majority (87.9%) of decedents died due to heroin overdose and were male (87%). There has been a significant increase in the mean age of the opioid group for the past 19 years. The majority of heroin overdose cases (58%) has had no other psychofarmacons present at the toxicological examination. We have found a slight but significant positive correlation (p=0.0204, r=0.349) between the number of heroin overdose death cases and the mean concentration of street level purity heroin. Most of the examined demographic and toxicological features of the population studied have been in concordance with data previously reported. However, in contrast to other studies we report a strikingly high proportion of \"pure\" heroin overdose cases where no other psychoactive substances were found. The reason for this is currently unknown; we can only speculate that it can be related to the fact that heroin is used and abused differently from other countries. The remarkable phenomenon of the \"ageing\" of heroin users may also support a change in the drug use habits of the youngest population. The emergence and spread of new designer drugs also change the mortality characteristics of the youngest abusers and pose a new challenge for researchers.",

The aim of this review is to collect and interpret the latest opinions in the development, the underlying mechanisms and therapy of addiction as a disease of central nervous system. The neurocircuitry, the transmitters and the epigenetics of addiction are discussed.", 
    "25": "Azacitidine is widely used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). The analysis of azacitidine in biological samples is subject to interference by endogenous compounds. Previously reported high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) bioanalytical assays for azacitidine suffer from expensive sample preparation procedures or from long separation times to achieve the required selectivity. Herein, supercritical fluid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) was explored as a more promising technique for the selective analysis of structure-like or chiral drugs in biological matrices. In this study, a simple, rapid and specific SFC/MS/MS analytical method was developed for the determination of azacitidine levels in rat plasma. Azacitidine was completely separated from the endogenous compounds on an ACQUITY UPLC\u2122 BEH C18 column (100 mm\u00d73.0 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm; Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) using isocratic elution with CO2/methanol as the mobile phase. The single-run analysis time was as short as 3.5 min. The sample preparation for protein removal was accomplished using a simple methanol precipitation method. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of azacitidine was 20 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 15%, and the relative error (RE) was within \u00b115% for the medium- and high-concentration quality control (QC) samples and within \u00b120% for the low-concentration QC samples. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats following the intravenous administration of azacitidine.", 
    "26": "The drug duloxetine (Cymbalta(\u00ae)) is a newer antidepressant which has been available in Australia since 2008. Duloxetine is a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which is associated with adverse effects in the first 6 weeks of therapy, including tachycardia and worsening symptoms in people with advanced heart failure. It is also associated with serotonin toxicity in combination with certain drugs. Few reports have been published in the toxicology literature regarding duloxetine and its prevalence in coroners' cases. This study documents the prevalence of duloxetine in coronial cases between 2009 and 2012 and seeks to better understand the role of duloxetine in deaths where concomitant use with other drugs may cause adverse outcomes. Duloxetine was analyzed in blood specimens taken for the purpose of assisting the pathologist in determining a cause of death and analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method employed for overnight screening. There were 34 cases where duloxetine was detected of which 19 were attributed to drug toxicity. The median femoral blood concentration in the cohort was 0.14 mg/L (range 0.01-1.42 mg/L). Many deaths involved the concomitant use of numerous other medications; up to 13 other drugs were co-detected in a case. Over half of the deaths were attributed to fatal combined drug toxicity. SSRIs and venlafaxine that may have increased the risk of serotonin toxicity in combination with duloxetine were detected in five cases. Metoclopramide, contraindicated with duloxetine use, was detected in two cases. NSAIDs (n=11), antipsychotics (n=15) and benzodiazepines (n=14) were also commonly co-detected. Heart disease was observed in over 40% of the cohort, mostly in the form of coronary artery disease or cardiomegaly. Death involving duloxetine alone was uncommon (n=4); however with certain comorbidities and co-administered drugs, the risk of a fatal event is increased, particularly in the setting of other pro-serotonergic agents. In deaths where duloxetine is detected and the cause of death is believed to be natural or unascertained, it is essential that other serotonin drugs or inappropriate drug combinations be examined for their possible contribution to death.", 
    "27": "This paper presents, for the first time, community-wide estimation of drug and pharmaceuticals consumption in England using wastewater analysis and a large number of compounds. Among groups of compounds studied were: stimulants, hallucinogens and their metabolites, opioids, morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and others. Obtained results showed the usefulness of wastewater analysis in order to provide estimates of local community drug consumption. It is noticeable that where target compounds could be compared to NHS prescription statistics, good comparisons were apparent between the two sets of data. These compounds include oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, methadone, tramadol, temazepam and diazepam. Whereas, discrepancies were observed for propoxyphene, codeine, dosulepin and venlafaxine (over-estimations in each case except codeine). Potential reasons for discrepancies include: sales of drugs sold without prescription and not included within NHS data, abuse of a drug with the compound trafficked through illegal sources, different consumption patterns in different areas, direct disposal leading to over estimations when using parent compound as the drug target residue and excretion factors not being representative of the local community. It is noticeable that using a metabolite (and not a parent drug) as a biomarker leads to higher certainty of obtained estimates. With regard to illicit drugs, consistent and logical results were reported. Monitoring of these compounds over a one week period highlighted the expected recreational use of many of these drugs (e.g. cocaine and MDMA) and the more consistent use of others (e.g. methadone).", 
    "28": "The bacterium Micromonospora sp. RV115, isolated from a marine sponge, produces the unusual metabolite diazepinomicin, a prenylated benzodiazepine derivative. We have cloned the prenyltransferase gene dzmP from this organism, expressed it in Escherichia coli, and the resulting His8-tagged protein was purified and investigated biochemically. It was found to catalyze the farnesylation of the amide nitrogen of dibenzodiazepinone. DzmP belongs to the ABBA prenyltransferases and is the first member of this superfamily which utilizes farnesyl diphosphate as genuine substrate. All previously discovered members utilize either dimethylallyl diphosphate (C5) or geranyl diphosphate (C10). Another putative diazepinomicin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the genome of Streptomyces griseoflavus T\u00fc4000, suggesting that the formation of diazepinomicin is not restricted to the genus Micromonospora. The gene cluster contains a gene ssrg_00986 with 61.4% identity (amino acid level) to dzmP. The gene was expressed in E. coli, and the purified protein showed similar catalytic properties as DzmP. Both enzymes also accepted other phenolic or phenazine substrates. ABBA prenyltransferases are useful tools for chemoenzymatic synthesis, due to their nature as soluble, stable biocatalysts. The discovery of DzmP and Ssrg_00986 extends the isoprenoid substrate range of this superfamily. The observed prenylation of an amide nitrogen is an unusual biochemical reaction.",

In this case series, we present four critically ill children with neuroblastoma who were diagnosed with delirium in the post-operative period. In all four patients, the diagnosis of delirium facilitated targeted intervention and improvement.

    "30": "Noninferiority analysis is a statistical method of growing importance in comparative effectiveness research that has rarely been used in psychopharmacology. This method is used here to evaluate whether first-generation antipsychotics are clinically not inferior to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) using data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). A conservative noninferiority margin (NIM) on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was derived from the smallest published value for the minimal clinically important difference, further reduced by 25%. This NIM was used to assess whether perphenazine is noninferior to olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine on the basis of the 95% confidence intervals of differences in mean PANSS outcomes (N = 1049). Perphenazine was noninferior to all three SGAs during 18 months of intention-to-treat analysis and in several subanalyses. Noninferiority can be evaluated from studies designed as superiority trials. Power was available in the CATIE to conduct noninferiority analysis.", 
    "31": "Phenols are well known noxious compounds, which are often found in various water sources. A novel analytical method has been researched and developed based on the properties of hemin-graphene hybrid nanosheets (H-GNs). These nanosheets were synthesized using a wet-chemical method, and they have peroxidase-like activity. Also, in the presence of H2O2, the nanosheets are efficient catalysts for the oxidation of the substrate, 4-aminoantipine (4-AP), and the phenols. The products of such an oxidation reaction are the colored quinone-imines (benzodiazepines). Importantly, these products enabled the differentiation of the three common phenols - pyrocatechol, resorcin and hydroquinone, with the use of a novel, spectroscopic method, which was developed for the simultaneous determination of the above three analytes. This spectroscopic method produced linear calibrations for the pyrocatechol (0.4-4.0 mg L(-1)), resorcin (0.2-2.0 mg L(-1)) and hydroquinone (0.8-8.0 mg L(-1)) analytes. In addition, kinetic and spectral data, obtained from the formation of the colored benzodiazepines, were used to establish multi-variate calibrations for the prediction of the three phenol analytes found in various kinds of water; partial least squares (PLS), principal component regression (PCR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were used and the PLS model performed best.",

    "36": "Midazolam (MDL) was known to act through stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors (GABA). Whether midazolam affects ion currents and membrane potential in neurons remains largely unclear. Electrophysiological studies of midazolam actions were performed in differentiated motor neuron-like (NSC-34 and NG108-15) cells. Midazolam suppressed the amplitude of delayed rectifier K(+) current (IK(DR)) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 10.4 \u00b5M. Addition of midazolam was noted to enhance the rate of IK(DR) inactivation. On the basis of minimal binding scheme, midazolam-induced block of IK(DR) was quantitatively provided with a dissociation constant of 9.8 \u00b5M. Recovery of IK(DR) from inactivation in the presence of midazolam was fitted by a single exponential. midazolam had no effect on M-type or erg-mediated K(+) current in these cells. Midazaolam (30 \u00b5M) suppressed the peak amplitude of voltage-gated Na(+) current (INa) with no change in the current-voltage relationships of this current. Inactivation kinetics of INa remained unaltered in the presence of this agent. In current-clamp configuration, midazolam (30 \u00b5M) prolonged the duration of action potentials (APs) and reduce AP amplitude. Similarly, in differentiated NG108-15 cells, the exposure to midazolam also suppressed IK(DR) with a concomitant increase in current inactivation. Midazolam can act as an open-channel blocker of delayed-rectifier K(+) channels in these cells. The synergistic blocking effects on IK(DR) and INa may contribute to the underlying mechanisms through which midazolam affects neuronal function in vivo.",

An anesthesiologist may be presented with a well-motivated breast-feeding mother who wishes to breast-feed her infant in the perioperative period. Administration of anesthesia entails acute administration of drugs with potential for sedation and respiratory effects on the nursing infant. The short-term use of these drugs minimizes the possibility of these effects. The aim should be to minimize the use of narcotics and benzodiazepines, use shorter acting agents, use regional anesthesia where possible and avoid agents with active metabolites. Frequent clinical assessments of the nursing infant are important. Available literature does suggest that although the currently available anesthetic and analgesic drugs are transferred in the breast milk, the amounts transferred are almost always clinically insignificant and pose little or no risk to the nursing infant.",

Eighty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the nonstressed groups or the 3-day restraint shock PTSD rodent model groups. There were four groups within the nonstressed rats (control, THP, midazolam, and midazolam with THP) and four groups within the stressed rats (control, THP, midazolam, and midazolam with THP). After injection the subjects were euthanized and the amygdala and hippocampus were sent for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction gene expression analysis. Of the genes interrogated, 17 genes in the amygdala and 18 genes in the hippocampus were found to have significant changes in gene expression and regulation. Significant transcriptional fold changes were found in important genes involved in dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter systems. The results provide quantifiable data demonstrating gene expression changes in PTSD-stressed and nonstressed rats receiving various treatments. These findings contribute important data to the limited molecular details pertaining to the neurobiology of PTSD.",

The supposed localization of this disorder is a short arm of chromosome 11 (11p 15.5). Its prevalence is 1:13 per 700 newborns. West syndrome is an age-dependent epileptic syndrome related to a group of infantile epileptic encephalopathies and characterized by a triad of basic symptoms: series of infantile spasms, psychomotor retardation and severe paroxysmal EEG changes. The incidence of West syndrome is estimated at 1 case per 2,000-4,000 newborns. The article describes a rare clinical case: a combination of BWS with one of the types of infantile epileptic encephalopathies--West syndrome. A detailed analysis of the West syndrome progression in a female patient with BWS is given, the tactics of antiepileptic therapy is analyzed, and its complexity in terms of metabolic disorders caused by the presence of a genetic syndrome in a patient is shown. The results of a long catamnesis are described. The figures are the fragments of native electroencephalograms at the eruptive phase of West syndrome and against the background of a long-term remission. When describing the clinical case in detail, the authors actively discuss the obtained information and available literature data.

    "64": "Aims: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of severe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms and to identify factors associated with PTSD in survivors of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment following traumatic injury. Methods: Fifty-two patients who were admitted to an ICU through the emergency ward following traumatic injury were prospectively followed. Information on injury severity and ICU treatment were obtained through medical records. Demographic information and measures of acute stress symptoms, experienced social support, coping style, sense of coherence (SOC) and locus of control were assessed within one-month post-accident (T1). At the six months follow-up (T2), PTSD was assessed with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Results: In the six months follow-up, 10 respondents (19.2%) had HTQ total scores reaching a level suggestive of PTSD (N\u2009=\u200952), and 11 respondents (21%) had symptom levels indicating subclinical PTSD. Female, five illness factors: coma time, mechanical ventilation, sedation, benzodiazepine, pain relieving medication, and four psychological factors: symptoms of acute stress (T1), fear of death and/or feeling completely helpless and powerless in relation to the accident and/or ICU (T1), SOC (T1) and more external locus of control (T1) correlated significantly with PTSD symptoms at T2. In the linear regression analysis, female, length of sedation, dissociation (T1), hypervigilance (T1), and external locus of control predicted 58% of the variation of PTSD. Conclusions: High levels of PTSD symptoms occurred in 19.2% of respondents in six months following traumatic injury requiring ICU admission. Screening for the variables gender, length of sedation, dissociation, hypervigilance, and locus of control after ICU admission following traumatic injuries may help to predict who will develop PTSD.",

Effects of midazolam on the proliferation and apoptosis of JeKo-1 cells were observed by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Effect of midazolam on the expression of BCL-2, cytochrome C (Cyto-C), pro-caspase-9, pro-caspase-8 and pro-caspase-3 protein were detected by Western blot. The results showed that midazolam could inhibit the growth of JeKo-1 cells significantly and the concentration of 50% growth inhibition (IC50) at 48 hours was approximately 40 \u00b5mol/L. After treatment with 20, 40, 80 \u00b5mol/L midazolam for 48 hours, a dose-dependent apoptosis of JeKo-1 cells could be observed. Meanwhile, a dose-dependent reduction of BCL-2, pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3 protein expression and increase of Cyto-C protein expression in JeKo-1 cells were found, but the expression of pro-caspase-8 protein did not change. It is concluded that midazolam possibly initiates the mitochondrial pathway, not the death receptor pathway, by reducing the expression of BCL-2, leading in turn to the releasing of Cyto-C in mitochondria, then activating caspase-9 and caspase-3 protein, triggers the caspase cascade, and induces the apoptosis of JeKo-1 cells ultimately.",

The present study aimed to reveal the molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the effects of BZs in the hippocampus (HIP), an area involved in drug-related plasticity, by investigating the regulation of immediate early genes following BZ administration. Previous studies have demonstrated that both brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and c-Fos contribute to memory- and abuse-related processes that occur within the HIP, and their expression is altered in response to BZ exposure. In the current study, mice received acute or repeated administration of BZs and HIP tissue was analyzed for alterations in BDNF and c-Fos expression. Although no significant changes in BDNF or c-Fos were observed in response to twice-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of diazepam (10 mg/kg + 5 mg/kg) or zolpidem (ZP; 2.5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg/kg), acute i.p. administration of both triazolam (0.03 mg/kg) and ZP (1.0 mg/kg) decreased BDNF protein levels within the HIP relative to vehicle, without any effect on c-Fos. ZP specifically reduced exon IV-containing BDNF transcripts with a concomitant increase in the association of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) with BDNF promoter IV, suggesting that MeCP2 activity at this promoter may represent a ZP-specific mechanism for reducing BDNF expression. ZP also increased the association of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) with BDNF promoter I. Future work should examine the interaction between ZP and DNA as the cause for altered gene expression in the HIP, given that BZs can enter the nucleus and intercalate into DNA directly.",

    "94": "Portosystemic or type C hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication and an indicator of a worsening prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis. It is characterized by alterations in cognition, consciousness, and motor function. Usually type C HE occurs episodically. However, a few patients also present with chronic progressive symptoms of central nervous system dysfunction. In these cases motor symptoms most often exceed cognitive dysfunction and alterations of consciousness. The most frequent features of these chronic progressive forms of HE are acquired hepatocerebral degeneration and hepatic myelopathy. Current hypotheses about the pathophysiology of type C HE are based on the finding that symptoms occur in the presence of hyperammonemia, especially, but are amplified by accompanying factors such as inflammation, hyponatremia, or the application of benzodiazepines, for example. Accordingly, therapy aims at the reduction of ammonia production and absorption, and, since most of the HE episodes are provoked by nutritional protein overload, gastrointestinal bleeds, infection, medication (especially sedatives or diuretics) or constipation, by treatment of the provoking factor. Of note, this approach does not work in acquired hepatocerebral degeneration and hepatic myelopathy. Here liver transplantation should be considered early in the course of the disease.",

    "96": "An integrated automated approach has been developed for the direct determination of drug concentrations using a SCAP DBS system for online extraction and analysis of dried blood spots (DBS) from DBS paper cards to a multidimensional liquid chromatography system coupled to a high-resolution QTOF mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). An accurate, precise, selective, and sensitive two-dimensional liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (2D LC-HRMS) assay was developed and validated using small volumes of rat blood (approximately 1.25 \u03bcL) from a 2 mm DBS punch. The methodology was validated according to internationally accepted regulated bioanalysis acceptance criteria in order to establish the validity of the combination of online DBS assay and use of HRMS for quantitative bioanalysis. The fully automated procedure exhibited acceptable linearity (r(2) > 0.997) over the concentration range of 5 to 1000 ng/mL. Intra- and interday precision and accuracy runs indicated relative errors less than 20% at the LLOQ level and less than 15% at all other levels. The direct extraction and analysis of DBS samples resulted in a 5-fold improvement in assay sensitivity compared to conventional off-line extraction of punched DBS samples. In addition, the impact of blood hematocrit (Hct) on accurate quantification of the studied drugs also was evaluated, comparing Hct values of 30% and 60% against standards prepared at 45%. Hematocrit experiments show that Hct can influence the accuracy of drugs quantified by DBS and needs to be thoroughly evaluated prior to committing to validating a DBS assay. The online DBS system coupled to the LC-HRMS was then successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats after administration of a single dose of 5 and 10 mg/kg for midazolam and desipramine, respectively.", 
    "97": "Approximately 2% to 9% of patients seen in a family physician's office have alcohol dependence. These patients are at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome if they abruptly abstain from alcohol use. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome begins six to 24 hours after the last intake of alcohol, and the signs and symptoms include tremors, agitation, nausea, sweating, vomiting, hallucinations, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension, delirium, and seizures. Treatment aims to minimize symptoms, prevent complications, and facilitate continued abstinence from alcohol. Patients with mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be treated as outpatients, which minimizes expense and allows for less interruption of work and family life. Patients with severe symptoms or who are at high risk of complications should receive inpatient treatment. In addition to supportive therapy, benzodiazepines, either in a fixed-dose or symptom-triggered schedule, are recommended. Medication should be given at the onset of symptoms and continued until symptoms subside. Other medications, including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, and gabapentin, have less abuse potential but do not prevent seizures. Typically, physicians should see these patients daily until symptoms subside. Although effective treatment is an initial step in recovery, long-term success depends on facilitating the patient's entry into ongoing treatment.", 
    "98": "The phylum Arthropoda includes arachnids and insects. Although their bites typically cause only local reactions, some species are venomous or transmit disease. The two medically important spiders in the United States are widow spiders (Latrodectus), the bite of which causes intense muscle spasms, and the brown recluse (Loxosceles), which may cause skin necrosis. Widow bites usually respond to narcotics, benzodiazepines, or, when necessary, antivenom. Most recluse bites resolve uneventfully without aggressive therapy and require only wound care and minor debridement. Tick bites can transmit diseases only after prolonged attachment to the host. Treatment of clothing with permethrin and proper tick removal greatly reduce the risk of infection. Ticks of medical importance in the United States include the black-legged tick, the Lone Star tick, and the American dog tick. The prophylactic use of a single dose of doxycycline for Lyme disease may be justified in high-risk areas of the country when an attached, engorged black-legged tick is removed. Bites from fleas, bedbugs, biting flies, and mosquitoes present as nonspecific pruritic pink papules, but the history and location of the bite can assist with diagnosis. Flea bites are usually on ankles, whereas mosquito bites are on exposed skin, and chigger bites tend to be along the sock and belt lines. Antihistamines are usually the only treatment required for insect bites; however, severe mosquito reactions (skeeter syndrome) may require prednisone. Applying insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) 10% to 35% or picaridin 20% is the best method for preventing bites.", 
    "99": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in an estimated 8% of men and 20% of women who are exposed to traumatic events. PTSD is a trauma- and stress-related disorder associated with significant psychosocial morbidity, substance abuse, and other negative physical health outcomes. The hallmarks of PTSD include exposure to a traumatic event; reexperiencing the event or intrusion symptoms; avoidance of people, places, or things that serve as a reminder of the trauma; negative mood and thoughts associated with the trauma; and chronic hyperarousal symptoms. Self-report questionnaires can assist clinicians in identifying anxiety problems associated with traumatic events. For patients who meet criteria for PTSD, trauma-focused psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy improve symptoms. Benzodiazepines and atypical antipsychotics are not recommended because studies have shown that adverse effects outweigh potential health benefits. Primary care physicians should monitor patients with PTSD for comorbid conditions such as substance abuse, mood disorders, and suicidality, and should refer patients to behavioral health specialists and support groups when appropriate.",

The dysfunction of serotoninergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, abnormal regulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), disturbance of cellular plasticity including reduced neurogenesis, or chronic inflammation connected with high oxidative damage play a crucial role in the development of anxiety and depression. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of atenolol alone and in combination with alprazolam/escitalopram on anxiety, depression and oxidative stress. Wistar albino rats were subjected to 21 day treatment of drugs then exposed to elevated-plus maze (EPM) and modified forced swim test (MFST), and oxidative stress markers were estimated in isolated brain tissue of all groups. The results indicated that atenolol in combination with alprazolam/escitalopram exhibited antidepressant effects by significantly decreasing the immobility and increasing the swimming behavior in the MFST and anti-anxiety effects by increasing the percentage preference and number of open arm entries as well as time spent in open arm in EPM. Pretreatment with atenolol alone and combination with alprazolam/escitalopram also ameliorated tissue glutathione (GSH) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level significantly which explore antioxidant properties of drugs, and combination augments the therapeutic response of monotherapy in depression. In conclusion behavioral and biological findings indicate that the combination of atenolol with alprazolam/escitalopram has the potential of being highly efficacious in treating anxiety and depressive disorders as well as oxidative stress.",

    "137": "Although benzodiazepines (BZDs) offer a wide spectrum of antiepileptic activity against diverse types of epileptic seizures, their use in the treatment of epilepsy is limited because of adverse effects, loss of efficacy (tolerance), and development of physical and psychological dependence. BZDs act as positive allosteric modulators of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by binding to the BZD recognition site (\"BZD receptor\") of the GABAA receptor. Traditional BZDs such as diazepam or clonazepam act as full agonists at this site, so that one strategy to resolve the disadvantages of these compounds would be the development of partial agonists with lower intrinsic efficacy at the BZD site of the GABAA receptor. Several BZD site partial or subtype selective compounds, including bretazenil, abecarnil, or alpidem, have been developed as anxioselective anxiolytic drugs, but epilepsy was not a target indication for such compounds. More recently, the imidazolone derivatives imepitoin (ELB138) and ELB139 were shown to act as low-affinity partial agonists at the BZD site of the GABAA receptor, and imepitoin was developed for the treatment of epilepsy. Imepitoin displayed a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity in diverse seizure and epilepsy models at tolerable doses, and, as expected from its mechanism of action, lacked tolerance and abuse liability in rodent and primate models. The more favorable pharmacokinetic profile of imepitoin in dogs versus humans led to the decision to develop imepitoin for the treatment of canine epilepsy. Based on randomized controlled trials that demonstrated antiepileptic efficacy and high tolerability and safety in epileptic dogs, the drug was recently approved for this indication in Europe. Hopefully, the favorable profile of imepitoin for the treatment of epilepsy in dogs will reactivate the interest in partial BZD site agonists as new treatments for human epilepsy.",

The severity of adverse effects, particularly those associated with the central nervous system, may be greater in older adults. Therefore, close monitoring is typically recommended when benzodiazepines are used by older adults. In addition, several reviews and guidelines recommend that the use of long-acting benzodiazepines by older adults be avoided. High utilization by older adults and documented safety concerns indicate that a review of the evidence on the use of benzodiazepines by older adults is warranted.",

The reactivation-extinction procedure has attracted the attention of basic and clinical researchers due to its potential clinical value for the treatment of psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and drug abuse disorders. However, mixed results have been achieved so far in replicating and understanding this paradigm. It has been proposed that memory destabilization could be critical in this sense. Using contextual fear conditioning in rats and midazolam as an amnesic agent, we first determined what reactivation conditions are necessary to destabilize the mnemonic trace. After establishing the conditions for memory destabilization, a series of experiments was conducted to determine if destabilization is critical for the success of the reactivation-extinction procedure. Data confirmed the importance of memory destabilization prior to extinction inside the reconsolidation window to attenuate spontaneous recovery and retard reacquisition of conditioned fear. The present report offers a candidate explanation of the discrepancy in results obtained with the reactivation-extinction procedure by different laboratories.",

    "155": "Discontinuation effects following cessation of 12 and 24 wk of pregabalin treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were evaluated in a placebo- and lorazepam-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial conducted in 16 countries. The study design consisted of two 12-wk treatment periods (periods 1 and 2), each followed by a 1-wk taper and two post-discontinuation assessments, one immediately following the taper and one 1-wk post-taper. Patients were assigned to receive an initially flexible dose of pregabalin 450-600 mg/d, pregabalin 150-300 mg/d, or lorazepam 3-4 mg/d for 6 wk; responders continued fixed-dose therapy for 6 additional weeks. Patients entering period 2 continued on the same fixed dose or switched to placebo. Discontinuation effects were evaluated with the Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC) and reported discontinuation-emergent signs and symptoms. Rebound anxiety was measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. GAD symptoms improved with all treatments and improvements were maintained over 12 and 24 wk. Low levels of discontinuation symptoms were evident in all treatment groups. For patients who received active treatment during both periods, mean (95% confidence interval) increases on the PWC from last visit on active treatment to the second post-discontinuation assessment were: pregabalin 450-600 mg/d: 2.8 (1.6-3.9), pregabalin 150-300 mg/d: 1.7 (0.7-2.8), lorazepam 3-4 mg/d: 2.2 (1.0-3.5). Rates of rebound anxiety were also low at both 12 and 24 wk (0-6%). This suggests that risk of discontinuation symptoms and rebound anxiety are low for pregabalin after 12 and 24 wk of treatment.", 
    "156": "Olanzapine (Olz) is one of the most effective antipsychotic drugs commonly used for treating schizophrenia. Unfortunately, Olz administration is associated with severe weight gain and metabolic disturbances. Both patients and clinicians are highly interested in the development of new antipsychotics which are as effective as atypical antipsychotics but which have a lower propensity to induce metabolic side effects. In the present study, we examined two new derivatives of Olz; OlzEt (2-ethyl-4-(4'-methylpiperazin-1'-yl)-10Hbenzo[b]thieno[2,3-e][1,4]diazepine), and OlzHomo (2-ethyl-4-(4'-methyl-1',4'-diazepan-1'-yl)-10H-benzo[b]thieno[2,3-e] [1,4]diazepine), for their tendency to induce weight gain in rats. Weight gain and metabolic changes were measured in female Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were treated orally with Olz, OlzEt, OlzHomo (3 or 6 mg/kg/day), or vehicle (n\u200a=\u200a8), three times daily at eight-hour intervals for 5 weeks. Furthermore, a phencyclidine (PCP)-treated rat model was used to examine the prevention of PCP-induced hyperlocomotor activity relevant for schizophrenia therapy. Male Sprague Dawley rats were pre-treated with a single dose (3 mg/kg/day) of Olz, OlzEt, OlzHomo, or vehicle (n\u200a=\u200a12), for 2 weeks. Locomotor activity was recorded following a subcutaneous injection with either saline or PCP (10 mg/kg). Olz was found to induce weight gain, hyperphagia, visceral fat accumulation, and metabolic changes associated with reduced histamatergic H1 receptor density in the hypothalamus of treated rats. In contrast, OlzEt and OlzHomo presented promising antipsychotic effects, which did not induce weight gain or fat deposition in the treated animals. Behavioural analysis showed OlzEt to attenuate PCP-induced hyperactivity to a level similar to that of Olz; however, OlzHomo showed a lower propensity to inhibit these stereotyped behaviours. Our data suggest that the therapeutic effectiveness of OlzHomo may be delivered at a higher dose than that of Olz and OlzEt. Overall, OlzEt and OlzHomo may offer a better pharmacological profile than Olz for treating patients with schizophrenia. Clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis.",

However, baclofen is known to induce a neuroadaptation process, which may be identified by the occurrence of a specific baclofen withdrawal syndrome (BWS), that is, confusion, agitation, seizures, and delirium. The same set of symptoms characterizes alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), which could lead to mistaking BWS for AWS in some situations. We report the cases of 3 patients under a chronic baclofen treatment for AUD. The patients emergently presented with a clinical state of confusion that was initially diagnosed and treated as AWS, with limited effect of benzodiazepines. Retrospectively, using a validated algorithm for assessing drug-induced withdrawal, we determined that all of these clinical cases were consistent with BWS. Both AWS and BWS should be considered in the case of acute confusion or delirium occurring in patients treated with baclofen for AUD. Moreover, further research should investigate to what extent GABA-A and GABA-B induce shared or distinct neuroadaptation processes and withdrawal syndromes.",

Medications that reduce glutamate release or block NMDA overactivation have shown efficacy for treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Dextromethorphan (DXM), a widely used antitussive drug, is a low-affinity, noncompetitive NMDA antagonist with potential neuroprotective properties. This study, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design, examined the benefit of DXM in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol-dependent patients admitted for detoxification treatment and experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal, as measured by a score greater than 10 on the revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar), were randomly assigned to receive either DXM 360 mg/d or an identical placebo for 7 days in a double-blind manner. All subjects received a concurrent dose of lorazepam 2 mg along with the initial administration of DXM or placebo and were given additional lorazepam (1 mg) as a rescue medication according to the symptom-triggered detoxification protocol. Outcome measures consisted of the mean total dose of lorazepam received, the sequential scores on the CIWA-Ar, and craving assessed by the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale. Forty subjects completed the study, 18 in the DXM group and 22 in the placebo group. We found that compared with placebo, DXM use was not associated with lower lorazepam doses to control alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The progression in CIWA-Ar and Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale scores was also comparable between the 2 groups. Our preliminary results do not support the efficacy of high-dose DXM in reducing the need of benzodiazepines to treat withdrawal symptoms in alcohol-dependent patients.",

This retrospective analysis included all patients 18 years and younger, who were admitted and discharged from a child and adolescent tertiary care inpatient psychiatric facility between May 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009. Data for medications at admission were obtained using a province-wide network that links all pharmacies in British Columbia, Canada to a central set of data systems, whereas data for medications at discharge were obtained using the Department of Pharmacy's (British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) inpatient computer database. Apart from antipsychotics, overall drug use included antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, stimulants, and sleep medications. Referral and discharge diagnoses were also examined. During the study period, 335 patients were admitted and discharged from the tertiary care inpatient psychiatric facility. Significantly, more patients were prescribed with an antipsychotic at the time of discharge from hospital compared with that of the time when they were admitted to hospital (51.6% vs 30.7%; P < 0.0001).

    "173": "This work was performed to characterize the possible mechanisms involved in the anxiolytic-like activity of gallic acid (GA) in the rat elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Male Wistar rats were acutely treated with a single dose of GA (10-500 mg/kg, i.p.) or diazepam and buspirone, 30 min prior to behavioral assessment in the EPM, open-field and rotarod tests. Treatment with GA markedly produced an increase in the time spent and entries in the open arms of EPM at doses of 30 and 300 mg/kg, respectively. These effects were comparable to those of the diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and buspirone (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Pretreatment with benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (3 mg/kg, i.p.) partially blocked the anxiolytic-like effect of GA. However, an increase in the time spent and entries in the open arms of EPM observed with GA treatment were significantly inhibited by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). In the open-field test, only GA at a dose of 500 mg/kg decreased locomotor activity in rats. Moreover, GA (10-300 mg/kg, i.p.) or diazepam and buspirone did not alter motor coordination in the rotarod test. These results indicate that GA is an effective anxiolytic agent at low doses, while at the highest dose it has sedative effect. Also this study suggests that the anxiolytic-like activity of GA is primarily mediated by the 5-HT1A but not benzodiazepine receptors.",

In case of refractory status epilepticus, 34% of physicians would give three doses of benzodiazepine, whereas 19% did not know what to do. These results suggest poor adherence to national protocol.", 
    "203": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless, flammable, extremely hazardous gas with a \"rotten egg\" smell. The human body produces small amounts of H2S and uses it as a signaling molecule. The cocktail method was used to evaluate the influence of H2S on the activities of CYP450 in rats, which were reflected by the changes of pharmacokinetic parameters of five specific probe drugs: bupropion, metroprolol, midazolam, omeprazole and tolbutamide, respectively. The rats were randomly divided into two groups, control group and H2S group. The H2S group rats were given 5 mg/kg NaHS by oral administration once a day for seven days. The mixture of five probes was given to rats through oral administration and the blood samples were obtained at a series of time-points through the caudal vein. The concentrations of probe drugs in rat plasma were measured by LC-MS. In comparing the H2S group with the control group, there was a statistically pharmacokinetics difference for midazolam and tolbutamide; the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was decreased for midazolam (p < 0.05) and increased for tolbutamide (p < 0.05); while there was no statistical pharmacokinetics difference for bupropion, metroprolol and omeprazole. H2S could not influence the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in rats, while H2S could induce the activity of CYP3A4 and inhibit the activity of CYP2C9 in rats.", 
    "204": "The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD2-4 inhibitors hold therapeutic promise in preclinical models of hematologic malignancies. However, translation of these data to molecules suitable for clinical development has yet to be accomplished. Herein we expand the mechanistic understanding of BET inhibitors in multiple myeloma by using the chemical probe molecule I-BET151. I-BET151 induces apoptosis and exerts strong antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo. This is associated with contrasting effects on oncogenic MYC and HEXIM1, an inhibitor of the transcriptional activator P-TEFb. I-BET151 causes transcriptional repression of MYC and MYC-dependent programs by abrogating recruitment to the chromatin of the P-TEFb component CDK9 in a BRD2-4-dependent manner. In contrast, transcriptional upregulation of HEXIM1 is BRD2-4 independent. Finally, preclinical studies show that I-BET762 has a favorable pharmacologic profile as an oral agent and that it inhibits myeloma cell proliferation, resulting in survival advantage in a systemic myeloma xenograft model. These data provide a strong rationale for extending the clinical testing of the novel antimyeloma agent I-BET762 and reveal insights into biologic pathways required for myeloma cell proliferation.",

The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence and severity of fatigue among non-dialysis-dependent CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, to examine the association of fatigue with subjective and objective sleep quality, and to identify other modifiable factors associated with fatigue.", 
    "206": "A cross-sectional survey of 87 non-dialysis-dependent CKD (eGFR \u226445 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and 86 ESRD patients was done using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) and 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) vitality scale. Higher FACIT-F score denoted less fatigue. Objective sleep was assessed using in-home polysomnography. Predictors of fatigue were determined using a linear regression model.", 
    "207": "The mean FACIT-F score among all participants was 34.5 \u00b1 11.0. Mean scores were similar among CKD and ESRD groups (34.25 \u00b1 11.28 vs. 34.73 \u00b1 10.86; p = 0.73). On univariate analyses, patients with higher levels of fatigue were more likely to have cardiovascular disease, benzodiazepine use, depressive symptoms, and slightly lower hemoglobin and serum albumin levels. There was no significant association between severity of sleep apnea and level of fatigue (Apnea Hypopnea Index 20.1 \u00b1 27.6 vs. 20.3 \u00b1 22.0; p = 0.69). Presence of cardiovascular disease, low serum albumin, depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome were independently associated with greater fatigue in multivariable regression models. The FACIT-F score correlated closely with the SF-36 vitality score (r = 0.81, p < 0.0001).",

    "213": "A simple and rapid liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantitation of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in human plasma using Olanzapine-d3 and Fluoxetine-d5 HCl as internal standard (IS), respectively. After solid phase extraction of the plasma samples on Waters Oasis HLB Catridges, Olanzapine, Fluoxetine and IS were chromatographed on Thermo Hypersil Gold C18 (50 mm \u00d7 4.6 mmi.d., 5 \u03bcm) analytical column with isocratic elution using methanol: 2mM Ammonium acetate buffer (90:10). Quantitation was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer employing electrospray ionization technique and operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and positive ion mode with transitions at 313/256 for Olanzapine and 310/148 for Fluoxetine. The total chromatographic run time was 2.0 min and calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.10-20.00 ng/mL for Olanzapine and 0.50-50.00 ng/mL for Fluoxetine. The method was validated for selectivity, sensitivity, recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision and stability studies. The recoveries obtained for the Olanzapine and its IS was \u226587% and Fluoxetine and its IS was \u226591%. Recoveries obtained were consistent and reproducible. Inter-batch and intra-batch coefficient of variation across three validation runs (LLOQ, LQC, MQC1, MQC and HQC) was less than 3.6 for Olanzapine and less than 5.2% for Fluoxetine. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of fixed dose combination of Olanzapine/Fluoxetine in healthy male volunteers.", 
    "214": "Carbamazepine (CBZ) is the gold standard antiepileptic drug (AED) for focal onset seizures. Despite CBZ being the benchmark AED, with readily available therapeutic drug monitoring, patients presenting with recurrent secondarily generalized tonic-clonic (or cluster) seizures or generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus (SE) are primarily treated with other long-acting agents. The aim of the study was to examine the potential use of rectal (PR) CBZ as alternative long-acting treatment to parenteral AEDs following the termination of cluster seizures or SE with acute intravenous therapies. Oral CBZ syrup was given PR using 400-mg equivalent aliquots. Serum CBZ levels were requested after administration to confirm achievement of minimum therapeutic levels (total CBZ>20\u03bcmol\u00b7L(-1)). Where levels were subtherapeutic, the procedure was repeated using 400-mg CBZ bolus aliquots until therapeutic levels were achieved. Seven patients received PR CBZ to manage cluster seizures or SE following the initial termination of acute seizures with IV therapies including benzodiazepines. Six patients had no prior history of seizures, and 1 patient with a prior history was not taking AED therapy at the time of presentation. All patients subsequently remained seizure-free, and therapeutic CBZ levels were achieved in 6 of the 7 subjects within 5-10h of initial CBZ dosing. In conclusion, the present study reports 7 patients who were safely and effectively treated with PR CBZ, which proved to be a viable and safe alternative to parenteral AEDs for maintenance of seizure freedom.", 
    "215": "This work aimed at designing a formulation based on nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for transdermal co-administration of olanzapine and simvastatin, using passive and active strategies in a combined in vitro/in vivo development approach. NLC were prepared by two distinct methods, namely solvent emulsification-evaporation (SE/E) and high pressure homogenization (HPH). HPH was selected on the basis of a better performance in terms of drug loading and in vitro permeation rate. Several mathematical models were used to elucidate the release mechanisms from lipid nanoparticles. In vitro release kinetics was shown to be driven by diffusion, but other mechanisms were also present, and supported the feasibility of using NLC for sustained drug delivery. The in vitro skin studies showed that the chemical penetration enhancers, limonene and ethanol, added to the NLC formulations, promoted a synergistic permeation enhancement of both drugs, with olanzapine exhibiting a higher permeation than simvastatin. Transdermal administration to rats resulted in steady-state levels reached at around 10h and maintained for 48h, again with olanzapine exhibiting a better permeation rate. The pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that the NLC dispersion displayed a better in vivo performance than the gel, which was consistent with the in vitro results. These differences were, however, negligible in the flux values, supporting the use of gel as a final, more convenient, formulation. The in vivo experiments in rats correlated well with in vitro findings and revealed that the combined use of ethanol and limonene, incorporated in the NLC formulation, provided the main driving force for drug permeation. The Dermaroller\u00ae pretreatment did not significantly enhance drug permeation, supporting the use of passive methods as suitable for a transdermal delivery system. Furthermore, this work may provide a promising proof-of-concept for further clinical application in the treatment of schizophrenia and associated disorders, combined with dyslipidemia.", 
    "216": "Phytol, a branched chain unsaturated alcohol, is particularly interesting because it is an isolated compound from essential oils of different medicinal plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anxiolytic-like effects of phytol in animal models to clarify their possible action mechanism. After acute intraperitoneal treatment with phytol at doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg behavioral models of open-field, elevated-plus-maze, rota-rod, light-dark, marble-burying and pentobarbital sleeping time tests were utilized. In open field test, phytol (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) [p<0.01] increased the number of crossings and rearings. However, the number of groomings [p<0.01] was reduced. Likewise, the number of entries and the time spent in light space were increased [p<0.01] while the number of marble-burying was decreased [p<0.001], in elevated-plus-maze, light-dark and marble-burying tests, respectively. In motor activity test, phytol (75 mg/kg) impaired the rota-rod performance of mice [p<0.01]. In pentobarbital sleeping time test, phytol 75 mg/kg decreased for latency of sleeping and phytol (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) increased the sleep time when compared to negative control [p<0.05]. All these effects were reversed by pre-treatment with flumazenil (2.5mg/kg, i.p.), similarly to those observed with diazepam (2mg/kg, i.p.; positive control) suggesting that the phytol presents mechanism of action by interaction with the GABAergic system. These findings suggest that acute administration of phytol exerts an anxiolytic-like effect on mice. Furthermore, suppose that phytol interacts with GABAA receptor, probably at the receptor subtypes that mediate benzodiazepines effects, to produce sedative and anxiolytic activities.",

This project extends the results of the National Institute of Mental Health-funded 2009 Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) psychopharmacologic treatment recommendations. The authors reviewed the literature on switching antipsychotics, focusing on randomized controlled trials published since the 2009 Schizophrenia PORT. The studies reviewed support a recommendation that an elective switch from higher to lower metabolic risk antipsychotics can produce weight and lipid benefits without significant risk of clinical deterioration. Evidence also suggests that certain antipsychotic switches may improve other adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin elevation. In deciding to make an elective change of antipsychotic medication, it is important to conduct a careful risk/benefit assessment with the patient. Before initiating a switch, patients should be educated about what to expect during the process. Studies also support gradual discontinuation of the current medication in order to minimize problems early in the switching process.",

Different GPs varied in the extent to which they were willing to prescribe benzodiazepines, and individual GPs' approaches also varied. GPs were ambivalent in their attitude towards prescribing benzodiazepines and inconsistently applied management strategies for their use. This was due to the changing context of prescribing, differing perceptions of the role and responsibility of the GP, variation in GPs' attitudes to benzodiazepines, perceived lack of alternative treatment options, GPs' perception of patient expectations and the doctor-patient relationship. GPs faced different challenges in managing initiation, continuation and withdrawal of benzodiazepines.",
