    "5": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an etiologically heterogeneous syndrome defined by cognitive impairment in advance of dementia. We previously reported in a retrospective analysis that daily 3 - 9 mg of a fast-release melatonin preparation given p. o. at bedtime for up to 3 years significantly improved cognitive and emotional performance and daily sleep/wake cycle in MCI patients. In a follow up of that study we now report data from another series of 96 MCI outpatients, 61 of who had received daily 3 - 24 mg of a fast-release melatonin preparation p. o. at bedtime for 15 to 60 months. Melatonin was given in addition to the standard medication prescribed by the attending psychiatrist. Patients treated with melatonin exhibited significantly better performance in Mini-Mental State Examination and the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale. After application of a neuropsychological battery comprising a Mattis\u00b4 test, Digit-symbol test, Trail A and B tasks and the Rey\u00b4s verbal test, better performance was found in melatonin-treated patients for every parameter tested. Abnormally high Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased in melatonin-treated patients, concomitantly with the improvement in the quality of sleep and wakefulness. The comparison of the medication profile in both groups of MCI patients indicated that 9.8% in the melatonin group received benzodiazepines vs. 62.8% in the non-melatonin group. The results further support that melatonin can be a useful add-on drug for treating MCI in a clinic environment.", 
    "6": "Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy can successfully be performed by applying moderate (conscious) sedation. Moderate sedation, using midazolam and an opioid, is the standard method of sedation, although propofol is increasingly being used in many countries because the satisfaction of endoscopists with propofol sedation is greater compared with their satisfaction with conventional sedation. Moreover, the use of propofol is currently preferred for the endoscopic sedation of patients with advanced liver disease due to its short biologic half-life and, consequently, its low risk of inducing hepatic encephalopathy. In the future, propofol could become the preferred sedation agent, especially for routine colonoscopy. Midazolam is the benzodiazepine of choice because of its shorter duration of action and better pharmacokinetic profile compared with diazepam. Among opioids, pethidine and fentanyl are the most popular. A number of other substances have been tested in several clinical trials with promising results. Among them, newer opioids, such as remifentanil, enable a faster recovery. The controversy regarding the administration of sedation by an endoscopist or an experienced nurse, as well as the optimal staffing of endoscopy units, continues to be a matter of discussion. Safe sedation in special clinical circumstances, such as in the cases of obese, pregnant, and elderly individuals, as well as patients with chronic lung, renal or liver disease, requires modification of the dose of the drugs used for sedation. In the great majority of patients, sedation under the supervision of a properly trained endoscopist remains the standard practice worldwide. In this review, an overview of the current knowledge concerning sedation during digestive endoscopy will be provided based on the data in the current literature.", 
    "7": "We investigated the mechanisms of ritonavir-mediated enhancement effect on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir using in vivo probes for CYP3A4 (midazolam), p-glycoprotein (fexofenadine), and OATP1B1 (pravastatin) following oral micro/small dosing. A cocktail of the drugs (2\u2009mg of saquinavir, 100\u2009\u00b5g of each probe) was administered to eight healthy volunteers (phase 1), and then coadministered with 20\u2009mg (phase 2) and 100\u2009mg (phase 3) of ritonavir. Plasma concentrations of the drugs were measured by validated LC-MS/MS methods. The mean plasma AUC0-24 (pg\u2009hour/mL) of saquinavir at phases 1, 2, and 3 was 101, 2\u2009540, and 23\u2009900 (P\u2009<\u2009.01), respectively. The relative area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)0-24 ratios of midazolam and fexofenadine at phases 1, 2, and 3 were 1:5.9:14.7 (P\u2009<\u2009.01), and 1:1.4:2.2 (P\u2009<\u2009.01-.05), respectively. In contrast, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Inhibition of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A-mediated metabolism, and intestinal p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of saquinavir, but not OATP1B1, is involved in the enhancement mechanism. Micro/small dosing is useful for examining the mechanism of drug interactions without safety concern.", 
    "8": "Neocortical neurons mediate the sedative and anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines. These agents enhance synaptic inhibition via positive modulation of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors harboring \u03b11-, \u03b12-, \u03b13- or \u03b15-protein subunits. Benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors containing the \u03b15-subunit are abundant in the neocortex, but their impact in controlling neuronal firing patterns is unknown. Here we studied how the discharge rates of cortical neurons are modified by a positive (SH-053-2'F-R-CH3) and a negative (L 655,708) \u03b15-subunit-preferring allosteric modulator in comparison to diazepam, the classical non-selective benzodiazepine. Drug actions were characterized in slice cultures from wild-type and \u03b15(H105R) knock-in mice by performing extracellular multi-unit-recordings. In knock-in mice, receptors containing the \u03b15 subunit are insensitive to benzodiazepines. The non-selective positive allosteric modulator diazepam decreased the discharge rates of neocortical neurons during episodes of ongoing neuronal activity (up states). In contrast to diazepam, the \u03b15-preferring positive modulator SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 accelerated action potential firing during up states. This promoting action was absent in slices from \u03b15(H105R) mice, confirming that it is mediated by the \u03b15-subunit. Consistent with these observations, the negative \u03b15-selective modulator L 655,708 inhibited up state action potential activity in slices from wild-type mice. The opposing actions of diazepam and SH-053-2'F-R-CH3, which both enhance GABAA receptor function but differ in subtype-selectivity, uncovers contrasting roles of GABAA receptor subtypes in controlling the firing rates of cortical neurons. These findings may have important implications for the design of novel anaesthetic and anticonvulsant benzodiazepines displaying an improved efficacy and fewer side effects.", 
    "9": "Voxel based morphometry (VBM) is a widely used technique for studying the structure of the brain. Direct comparisons between the results obtained using VBM and the underlying histology are limited, however. To circumvent the problems inherent in comparing VBM data in vivo with tissue samples that must generally be obtained post-mortem, we chose to consider GABAA receptors, measured using (18)F-flumazenil PET (18F-FMZ-PET), as non-invasive neural markers to be compared with VBM data. Consistent with previous cortical thickness findings, GABAA receptor binding potential (BPND) was found to correlate positively across regions with grey matter (GM) density. These findings confirm that there is a general positive relationship between MRI-based GM density measures and GABAA receptor BPND on a region-by-region basis (i.e., regions with more GM tend to also have higher BPND).",

None of these patients underwent intubation, defibrillation, cardioversion, pacing, fluid resuscitation, inotropic support or dialysis. Of the 32 patients, 17 (53%) were treated with physostigmine because of confusion, three of whom had previously received intravenous benzodiazepines. No patient could be effectively treated with benzodiazepines alone. There was no mortality, and all the patients were discharged within 3 days. None of them re-attended the emergency department within 1 week of discharge.

    "16": "Shigyakusan is a traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine used to treat inflammatory conditions such as cholecystitis and gastritis as well as psychiatric disorders. This study examined the anxiolytic-like effect of Shigyakusan extract (SS), and evaluated the activity of the main compound. Three behavioral tests in mice were used to evaluate the activity of SS. Samples were administered orally over a 10-day period. A light and dark box (LDB) test was performed on the 8th day, while an open field (OF) test was done on the 9th day, and an elevated plus maze (EPM) test was performed on the 10th day. Diazepam (DZ), a typical anxiolytic drug, was used as the positive control. Administration of 10 mg/kg DZ resulted in a significant anxiolytic-like effect in the LDB and EPM tests, while administration of 0.3 g/kg SS resulted in a weak anxiolytic-like effect. In the OF test, while DZ caused a significant reduction of locomotor activity, SS did not cause any changes compared to the water controls. This suggests that locomotor activity may be a side effect of DZ, and thus SS, which lacks this response, may be a more useful treatment. Quantitative analysis performed to clarify the activity of the main compound also determined that SS contained 51.4 mg/g naringin, which also has been reported to have anxiolytic-like activity. Since these results suggested that this compound might be responsible for the activity of SS, we subsequently examined the oral administration of a similar dose of naringin. Although we observed a tendency for a weak anxiolytic-like effect, this effect was not greater than that seen for SS.", 
    "17": "We have analyzed the effect of palmitoleic acid on short-term food intake in male rats. Administration of omega-7 palmitoleic acid by oral gavage significantly decreased food intake compared to palmitic acid, omega-9 oleic acid, or a vehicle control. Palmitoleic acid exhibited a dose-dependent effect in this context and did not cause general malaise. A triglyceride form of palmitoleate also decreased food intake, whereas olive oil, which is rich in oleic acid, did not. Palmitoleic acid accumulated within the small intestine in a dose-dependent fashion and elevated levels of the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Both protein and mRNA levels of CCK were affected in this context. The suppression of food intake by palmitoleic acid was attenuated by intravenous injection of devazepide, a selective peripheral CCK receptor antagonist. Palmitoleic acid did not alter the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) target genes, and a PPAR\u03b1 antagonist did not affect palmitoleic acid-induced satiety. This suggests that the PPAR\u03b1 pathway might not be involved in suppressing food intake in response to palmitoleic acid. We have shown that orally administered palmitoleic acid induced satiety, enhanced the release of satiety hormones in rats.", 
    "18": "\u03b3-Aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor activation is a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of drug addiction, pain, anxiety, and depression. However, full agonists of this receptor induce side-effects, such as sedation, muscle relaxation, tolerance, and cognitive disruption. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the GABAB receptor may have similar therapeutic effects as agonists with superior side-effect profiles. The present study behaviorally characterized N-([1R,2R,4S]-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)-2-methyl-5-(4-[trifluoromethyl]phenyl)-4-pyrimidinamine (BHF177), a GABAB receptor PAM, in mouse models of anxiety-like behavior, learning and memory. In addition, the effects of BHF177 were compared with the agonist baclofen. Unlike the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide, baclofen (0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and BHF177 (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, orally) had no effect on anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, light/dark box, or Vogel conflict test. Baclofen increased punished drinking in the Vogel conflict test, but this effect may be attributable to the analgesic actions of baclofen. At the highest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg), baclofen-treated mice exhibited sedation-like effects (i.e., reduced locomotor activity) across many of the tests, whereas BHF177-treated mice exhibited no sedation-like effects. BHF177 exhibited pro-convulsion properties only in mice, but not in rats, indicating that this effect may be species-specific. At doses that were not sedative or pro-convulsant, baclofen and BHF177 had no selective effects on fear memory retrieval in contextual and cued fear conditioning or spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze. These data suggest that BHF177 has little sedative activity, no anxiolytic-like profile, and minimal impairment of learning and memory in mice.", 
    "19": "The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and FT-Raman spectra of 8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine (8C1M6PB) have been recorded in the range of 4000-400 and 4000-100 cm(-1), respectively. A detailed interpretation of the vibrational spectra of this compound has been made on the basis of the calculated potential energy distribution (PED). The equilibrium geometries, harmonic frequencies, infrared intensities and Raman scattering activities were calculated by Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional B3LYP method with the 6-31G (d,p) basis set. The vibrational frequencies were calculated in all these methods and were compared with the experimental frequencies which yield good agreement between observed and calculated frequencies. The first order hyperpolarizability (\u03b2total) of this molecular system and related properties (\u03b2, \u03bc, and \u0394\u03b1) are calculated using HF/6-31G (d,p) and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) methods based on the finite-field approach. The calculated Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energies show that charge transfer occurs in the molecule. Stability of the molecule arising from hyper conjugative interactions, charge delocalization has been analyzed using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. Conformation analysis was carried for 8C1M6PB by Potential energy surface scan to find all possible conformers with B3LYP method using 6-31G (d,p) basis set. The entropy of the title compound is also performed at HF/6-31G (d,p) and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels of theory. In addition, the thermodynamic properties of the compound were calculated at different temperatures and corresponding relations between the properties and temperature were also studied.",

The aim of this study was to examine the association between the use of different classes of psychotropic medications, especially short acting benzodiazepines, and the frequency of falling in elderly. Study design This retrospective cohort study was performed with patients who visited the day clinic of the department of geriatric medicine of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands between 1 January 2011 and 1 April 2012. Measurements Frequencies of falling in the past year and medication use were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the frequency of falling in the past year and the use of psychotropic medications.", 
    "21": "During this period 404 patients were included and 238 (58.9%) of them had experienced one or more falls in the past year. After multivariate adjustment, frequent falls remained significantly associated with exposure to psychotropic medications (odds ratio [OR] 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-3.28), antipsychotics (OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.27-10.33), hypnotics and anxiolytics (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.05-3.11), short-acting benzodiazepines or Z-drugs (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.10-3.42) and antidepressants (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.33-4.16).", 
    "22": "This study confirms that taking psychotropic medication, including short-acting benzodiazepines, strongly increases the frequency of falls in elderly. This relation should be explicitly recognized by doctors prescribing for older people, and by older people themselves. If possible such medication should be avoided for elderly patients especially with other risk factors for falling.", 
    "23": "Anxiety disorders are among the most frequent psychiatric disorders. With regard to pharmacological treatment, antidepressants, the calcium modulator pregabalin and benzodiazepines are recommended according to current treatment guidelines. With regard to acute states of anxiety, so far practically only benzodiazepines provide an immediate anxiolytic effect. However, the risk of tolerance and dependency limits the use of this class of medication. Therefore, there is still a need for alternative pharmacologic strategies. Increasing evidence points towards anxiety-reducing properties of atypical antipsychotics, particularly quetiapine. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the putative acute anxiolytic effects of this compound, choosing the induction of acute anxiety in patients with specific phobia as a model for the evaluation of ad-hoc anxiolytic properties in a proof-of-concept approach. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 58 patients with arachnophobia were treated with a single dose of quetiapine XR or placebo prior to a virtual reality spider challenge procedure. Treatment effects were monitored using rating scales for acute anxiety as well as measurements of heart rate and skin conductance. Overall, quetiapine showed significant anxiolytic effects compared to placebo. However, effects were not seen on the primary outcome measure (VAS Anxiety), but were limited to somatic anxiety symptoms. Additionally, a significant reduction of skin conductance was observed. Further exploratory analyses hint towards a mediating role of the (COMT) val158met genotype on treatment response. The present results thus suggest a possible suitability of quetiapine in the acute treatment of anxiety, particularly with regard to somatic symptoms.",

Oocyte of Xenopus laevis is one of the most frequently used heterologous expression systems, which are used to design and analyze specific combinations of GABA A receptor subunits. In oocytes, a certain GABA A receptor function is studied only by comparing the amplitude of the response to GABA and other drugs by physiological and pharmacological methods. According to the studies on Xenopus laevis oocytes, the \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32S receptor combination is mostly used. The \u03b11-containing receptors mediate sedative and anticonvulsant acts. The results of studies on oocytes show that PKA, NKCC1, P2X3 receptors, and GABA A receptor-associated protein, etc., are existing systems that show different reactivity to the GABA A receptors. The GABA A receptor subunits contain distinct binding sites for BZDs, neurosteroids, general anesthetics, etc., which are responsible for the numerous functions of the GABA A receptor. A variety of other drugs, such as topiramate, TG41, (+)- and (-)-borneol, apigenin, and 6-methylflavone could also have modulatory effects on the GABA A receptors. Some of the different models and hypotheses on GABA A receptor structure and function have been achieved by using the two-electrode voltage clamp method in oocytes.",

Despite their widespread use concerns remain over their long-term safety through both neuronal and non-neuronal effects. We conducted a systematic review to identify vulnerable populations of patients who may be at increased risk of harm from benzodiazepines. We identified three potentially \"at risk\" groups of patients, those with renal disease, lung disease and those recently hospitalised. However methodological limitations including selection bias, vague descriptors of benzodiazepine use and inappropriate grouping together of benzodiazepines with other medications, precluded definitive conclusions. Future studies should concentrate on these groups to identify the long-term safety of benzodiazepines in these patient groups.",

It has beneficial effects on both positive and negative symptoms, an early onset of antipsychotic action and a favourable side effect profile. On the other hand, olanzapine has many reports of causing weight gain, glucose metabolism disturbances and lipidosis. We carried out blood tests (leptin, adiponectin, remnant-like lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C), total cholesterol, HbA1C, 75-OGTT and etc.) on patients with schizophrenia who had taken olanzapine. As a result, leptin, neutral lipid and RLP-C were significantly correlated by BMI. (The average blood test data and BMI revealed a normal range). Most analysis results of the lipoprotein fraction by a polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis method were normal patterns. Furthermore, the serum insulin concentrations from 75 g glucose tolerance (75 g-OGTT) 30 minutes later, in one third of patients receiving olanzapine, registered more than 100 microU/ml. The mechanism of the insulin secretion rise by olannzapine is unknown. Olanzapine may impair glucose tolerance due in part to increased insulin resistance. These findings do not necessarily imply that olanzapine is directly associated with a risk of impairment of weight gain, glucose metabolism disturbances and lipidosis. These results suggest that it is useful to promote diet cure and exercise therapy with patients with high BMI levels.", 
    "30": "Since the late 1980s, grapefruit juice has been known to affect the metabolism of certain drugs. Several serious adverse effects involving drug interactions with grapefruit juice have been published in detail. The components of grapefruit juice vary considerably depending on the variety, maturity and origin of the fruit, local climatic conditions, and the manufacturing process. No single component accounts for all observed interactions. Other grapefruit products are also occasionally implicated, including preserves, lyophylised grapefruit juice, powdered whole grapefruit, grapefruit seed extract, and zest. Clinical reports of drug interactions with grapefruit juice are supported by pharmacokinetic studies, each usually involving about 10 healthy volunteers, in which the probable clinical consequences were extrapolated from the observed plasma concentrations. Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4, the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme most often involved in drug metabolism. This increases plasma concentrations of the drugs concerned, creating a risk of overdose and dose-dependent adverse effects. Grapefruit juice also inhibits several other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, but they are less frequently implicated in interactions with clinical consequences. Drugs interacting with grapefruit and inducing serious clinical consequences (confirmed or very probable) include: immunosuppressants, some statins, benzodiazepines, most calcium channel blockers, indinavir and carbamazepine. There are large inter-individual differences in enzyme efficiency. Along with the variable composition of grapefruit juice, this makes it difficult to predict the magnitude and clinical consequences of drug interactions with grapefruit juice in a given patient. There is increasing evidence that transporter proteins such as organic anion transporters and P-glycoprotein are involved in interactions between drugs and grapefruit juice. In practice, numerous drugs interact with grapefruit juice. Although only a few reports involving severe clinical consequences have been published, they suggest that grapefruit juice should be avoided during drug therapy, especially when the drug has a narrow therapeutic margin or carries a risk of serious dose-dependent adverse effects. Patients should be informed of this risk whenever a drug is prescribed or dispensed.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the expression of CYP3A is affected by a high-fat diet. In addition, we examined whether the type of diet given to mice could produce changes in the expression level and activity of CYP3A. Mice were fed a purified diet containing 10 kcal% lard (control group) or 60 kcal% lard (HF group) or regular mouse chow containing 13 kcal% of fat (MF group) for 4 weeks. No significant differences were observed in the hepatic CYP3A protein expression level between the HF group and the control group. The CYP3A protein expression in the MF group was significantly higher than that observed in the control group. In the MF group, the area under the curve (AUC) of intraperitoneally administered triazolam was lower. Because lithocholic acid (LCA) is known to increase hepatic CYP3A expression, the levels of Clostridium sordellii and LCA in the feces were measured. In the MF group, the levels of Clostridium sordellii and LCA were higher. It has been demonstrated that a high-fat diet does not cause any changes in hepatic CYP3A expression. In addition, the different diets caused alterations in the enteric environment, which triggered changes in CYP3A expression.

The field of psychopharmacology has essentially ignored that simple but illustrative experiment in the intervening time. The present study reproduces principle elements of Galzigna's experiment and expands the scope to include the antipsychotic medications olanzapine and minocycline. The rate of reaction was slow, with maximal yield of black polymer being achieved by 4, 10 and 7 days with chlorpromazine, olanzapine and minocycline, respectively. Changing the pH was most informative for chlorpromazine and minocycline reactions, where yield increased sharply between pH 6.1 and 6.9, and decreased slightly between pH 6.9 and 7.8, consistent with reaction profiles expected for aromatic substitution. Preincubation of olanzapine with iodine doubled the polymer yield, facilitated by the addition of iodine to the aromatic ring and presumably followed by its departure as a \"leaving group\". Increasing the salt concentration 1.5-fold depressed yields for all three drugs, most likely via ionic shielding of charged functional groups, diminishing reactivity. The results are discussed in regards to the mechanism of action of antipsychotic medications, casting doubt on commonly held theories. The time course of the chemical reactions presented here and the concentrations required, are much more consistent with clinical results than are models concerning receptor-mediated mechanisms. Furthermore, minocycline was effective in this model, but does not appear to have affinity for the primary receptor families thought by many to mediate antipsychotic efficacy.",

A selective area of brain injury has never been reported with methadone use. We present a case of a 23-year-old man who had acute necrosis of the bilateral globi pallidi in the brain and systemic rhabdomyolysis after ingesting methadone and nasally insufflating alprazolam.

Less is known about the role of these receptors in anxiety-like states. Here we investigate how two distinct anxiolytic agents, buspirone, a partial 5-HT(1A) agonist, and diazepam, a benzodiazepine, influence phosphorylation of GluA1 subunits of AMPA receptors at the potentiating residue Ser(845) and Ser(831) in corticolimbic regions. To test the functional relevance of these changes, phosphomutant GluA1 mice lacking phosphorylatable Ser(845) and Ser(831) were examined in relevant behavioural paradigms. These mutant mice exhibited a reduced anxiety-like phenotype in the light/dark exploration task and elevated plus maze, but not in the novelty induced hypophagia paradigm. These data indicate that reduced potentiation of the AMPA receptor signalling, via decreased GluA1 phoshorylation, is specifically involved in approach-avoidance based paradigms relevant for anxiety-like behaviours.",

The methods of positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), Wechsler memory scale-4th edition (WMS-IV) and event-related potential (ERP) were used to study the effects of olanzapine on the cognitive function in the first-episode schizophrenic patients. We performed multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial to study the cognitive functioning in Han Chinese first-episode schizophrenic patients in a 12-week treatment regime with olanzapine (129 cases) or placebo (132 cases). The results showed that (1) the patients with first-episode schizophrenia showed significant deficits in the long-term memory, short-term memory, immediate memory and memory quotient by WMS-IV assessment, and decreases the total scores, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology by PANSS assessment; (2) olanzapine could significantly improve the PANSS scores including total scores, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology in the first-episode schizophrenic patients; (3) olanzapine could significantly improve the short-term memory, immediate memory and memory quotient in the first-episode schizophrenic patients; and (3) although the latencies of P(2), N(2) and P(3) were significantly prolonged, P(2) and P(3) amplitudes were decreased and the latencies of N(1) did not change, olanzapine did not influence any P(300) items in the first-episode schizophrenic patients.

    "76": "Antipsychotic drugs are increasingly used in children and adolescents to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the long-term effects of early life antipsychotic drug (APD) treatment. Most APDs are potent antagonists or partial agonists of dopamine (DA) D\u2082 receptors; atypical APDs also have multiple serotonergic activities. DA and serotonin regulate many neurodevelopmental processes. Thus, early life APD treatment can, potentially, perturb these processes, causing long-term behavioural and neurobiological sequelae. We treated adolescent, male rats with olanzapine (Ola) on post-natal days 28-49, under dosing conditions that approximate those employed therapeutically in humans. As adults, they exhibited enhanced conditioned place preference for amphetamine, as compared to vehicle-treated rats. In the nucleus accumbens core, DA D\u2081 receptor binding was reduced, D\u2082 binding was increased and DA release evoked by electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area was reduced. Thus, adolescent Ola treatment enduringly alters a key behavioural response to rewarding stimuli and modifies DAergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens. The persistence of these changes suggests that even limited periods of early life Ola treatment may induce enduring changes in other reward-related behaviours and in behavioural and neurobiological responses to therapeutic and illicit psychotropic drugs. These results underscore the importance of improved understanding of the enduring sequelae of paediatric APD treatment as a basis for weighing the benefits and risks of adolescent APD therapy, especially prophylactic treatment in high-risk, asymptomatic patients.",

Electroconvulsive therapy and pharmacotherapy are each efficacious in the treatment of PD. Expert guidelines recommend the combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medications in the acute pharmacologic treatment of PD. However, little is known about the continuation treatment of PD. Of particular concern, it is not known whether antipsychotic medication needs to be continued once an episode of PD responds to pharmacotherapy. This issue has profound clinical importance. On the one hand, the unnecessary continuation of antipsychotic medication exposes a patient to adverse effects, such as weight gain and metabolic disturbance. On the other hand, premature discontinuation of antipsychotic medication has the potential risk of early relapse of a severe disorder.",

Individuals aged 18-85 years with unipolar psychotic depression receive up to 12 weeks of open-label treatment with sertraline and olanzapine. Participants who achieve remission of psychosis and remission/near-remission of depressive symptoms continue with 8 weeks of open-label treatment to ensure stability of remission.

Although adult zebrafish have been recently used to study epileptic seizures, a thorough characterization of the PTZ-induced seizures in this animal model is missing. The goal of this study was to perform a detailed temporal behavior profile characterization of PTZ-induced seizure in adult zebrafish. The behavioral profile during 20 min of PTZ immersion (5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mM) was characterized by stages defined as scores: (0) short swim, (1) increased swimming activity and high frequency of opercular movement, (2) erratic movements, (3) circular movements, (4) clonic seizure-like behavior, (5) fall to the bottom of the tank and tonic seizure-like behavior, (6) death. Animals exposed to distinct PTZ concentrations presented different seizure profiles, intensities and latencies to reach all scores. Only animals immersed into 15 mM PTZ showed an increased time to return to the normal behavior (score 0), after exposure. Total mortality rate at 10 and 15 mM were 33% and 50%, respectively. Considering all behavioral parameters, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mM PTZ, induced seizures with low, intermediate, and high severity, respectively. Pretreatment with diazepam (DZP) significantly attenuated seizure severity. Finally, the brain PTZ levels in adult zebrafish immersed into the chemoconvulsant solution at 5 and 10 mM were comparable to those described for the rodent model, with a peak after a 20-min of exposure. The PTZ brain levels observed after 2.5-min PTZ exposure and after 60-min removal from exposure were similar. Altogether, our results showed a detailed temporal behavioral characterization of a PTZ epileptic seizure model in adult zebrafish. These behavioral analyses and the simple method for PTZ quantification could be considered as important tools for future investigations and translational research.",

Recent studies have shown that the ligands of translocator protein (TSPO, 18 kDa), a peripheral receptor for benzodiazepine, modulate inflammatory pain. Here, we report that TSPO was upregulated in astrocytes and microglia in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of rats following L5 spinal nerve ligation (L5 SNL), lasting until the vanishing of the behavioral signs of neuropathic pain (\u223c50 d). Importantly, a single intrathecal injection of specific TSPO agonists Ro5-4864 or FGIN-1-27 at 7 and 21 d after L5 SNL depressed the established mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia dramatically, and the effect was abolished by pretreatment with AMG, a neurosteroid synthesis inhibitor. Mechanically, Ro5-4864 substantially inhibited spinal astrocytes but not microglia, and reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in vivo and in vitro. The anti-neuroinflammatory effect was also prevented by AMG. Interestingly, TSPO expression returned to control levels or decreased substantially, when neuropathic pain healed naturally or was reversed by Ro5-4864, suggesting that the role of TSPO upregulation might be to promote recovery from the neurological disorder. Finally, the neuropathic pain and the upregulation of TSPO by L5 SNL were prevented by pharmacological blockage of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These data suggested that TSPO might be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.",

The purpose of this study is to illustrate the developmental processes involved in creation of a pediatric PBPK model incorporating existing adult drug data. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine utilized in both adults and children, was used as an example. A population-PBPK model was developed in PK-Sim v4.2\u00ae and scaled to account for age-related changes in size and composition of tissue compartments, protein binding, and growth/maturation of elimination processes. Dose (milligrams per kilogram) requirements for children aged 0-18 years were calculated based on simulations that achieved targeted exposures based on adult references. Predictive accuracy of the PBPK model for producing comparable plasma concentrations among 63 pediatric subjects was assessed using average-fold error (AFE). Estimates of clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V(ss)) were compared with observed values for a subset of 15 children using fold error (FE). Pediatric dose requirements in young children (1-3 years) exceeded adult levels on a linear weight-adjusted (milligrams per kilogram) basis. AFE values for model-derived concentration estimates were within 1.5- and 2-fold deviation from observed values for 73% and 92% of patients, respectively. For CL, 60% and 80% of predictions were within 1.5 and 2 FE, respectively. Comparatively, predictions of V(ss) were more accurate with 80% and 100% of estimates within 1.5 and 2 FE, respectively. Using the presented workflow, the developed pediatric model estimated lorazepam pharmacokinetics in children as a function of age.", 
    "100": "The interaction between oxazepam and C\u2086\u2080 fullerene was explored using first-principles vdW-DF calculations. It was found that oxazepam binds weakly to the fullerene cage via its carbonyl group. The binding of oxazepam to C\u2086\u2080 is affected drastically by nonlocal dispersion interactions, while vdW forces affect the corresponding geometries only a little. Furthermore, aqueous solution affects the geometries of the oxazepam approaching to fullerene slightly, while oxazepam binds slightly farther away from the nanocage. The results presented provide evidence for the applicability of the vdW-DF method and serve as a practical benchmark for the investigation of host-guest interactions in biological systems.", 
    "101": "A new process for obtaining dibenzo[c,f][1,2,5]thiadiazepines (DBTDs) and their effects on GABA(A) receptors of guinea pig myenteric neurons are described. Synthesis of DBTD derivatives began with two commercial aromatic compounds. An azide group was obtained after two sequential reactions, and the central ring was closed via a nitrene to obtain the tricyclic sulfonamides (DBTDs). Whole-cell recordings showed that DBTDs application did not affect the holding current but inhibited the currents induced by GABA (I(GABA)), which are mediated by GABA(A) receptors. These DBTDs effects reached their maximum 3 min after application and were: (i) reversible, (ii) concentration-dependent (with a rank order of potency of 2c = 2d > 2b), (iii) mediated by a non-competitive antagonism, and (iv) only observed when applied extracellularly. Picrotoxin (which binds in the channel mouth) and DBTDs effects were not modified when both substances were simultaneous applied. Our results indicate that DBTD acted on the extracellular domain of GABA(A) channels but independent of the picrotoxin, benzodiazepine, and GABA binding sites. DBTDs used here could be the initial model for synthesizing new GABA(A) receptor inhibitors with a potential to be used as antidotes for positive modulators of these receptors or to induce experimental epilepsy.",

Baseline BMI was associated with subsequent weight change irrespective of the antipsychotic given. Specifically, a smaller proportion of patients gained \u22657% baseline bodyweight, and a greater proportion of patients lost \u22657% baseline bodyweight with increasing baseline BMI. For olanzapine (the antipsychotic associated with highest mean weight gain in the total drug cohort), the percentage of patients gaining \u22657% baseline weight was 45% (95% CI: 43-48) in the underweight/normal weight BMI cohort and 20% (95% CI: 15-27) in the obese BMI cohort; 7% (95% CI: 6-8) of the underweight/normal cohort and 19% (95% CI: 13-27) of the obese cohort lost \u22657% baseline weight. BMI has an association with the likelihood of weight gain or loss and should be considered in analyses of antipsychotic weight change.",

However, the results have not been consistent and the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been elucidated. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate verbal and nonverbal cognition (using visuospatial processing tests) in patients treated with clozapine (initially treatment resistant) and those treated with other second-generation antipsychotics, relative healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we examined neural correlates of visuospatial processing in the three groups.",

The fMRI data were analysed separately in each group using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM5).", 
    "105": "Overall, schizophrenia patients exhibited deficit on verbal and nonverbal processing relative to the healthy controls, but we observed some interesting differences between the two groups of patients. Specifically, the NTR group performed better than the TR-C group on the Block Design and the Raven's Progressive Matrices. With respect to brain function during mental rotation, the NTR group showed significant activations in regions of the temporal and occipital cortex, whereas the TR-C patients did not. The relative deactivations associated with the task were also more robust in NTR compared to the other group of patients, despite a similar performance.", 
    "106": "Present results suggest better visuospatial processing in the NTR relative to the TR-C group. This difference could be attributed to the treatment resistance itself or a lack of beneficial effect of clozapine relative to other atypical antipsychotics in ameliorating nonverbal abilities. Future studies of the relationship between clozapine and cognition, as well as between treatment resistance and cognition, are warranted.", 
    "107": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and recurrent brain disorder that requires continuous, long-term treatment with antipsychotic medication to minimize relapse and provide clinical benefit to patients. For patients with schizophrenia, non-adherence to medication is a major risk factor for relapse and re-hospitalization. Long-acting injectable formulations of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs-LAIs) provide constant medication delivery and the potential for improved adherence. Currently, three drugs are available for the treatment of schizophrenia, risperidone longacting injectable, olanzapine pamoate and paliperidone palmitate. Several studies have also demonstrated efficacy and safety of such drugs in patients with acute schizophrenia. In the present paper the literature on LAI atypical antipsychotics will be reviewed and practical advice will be given concerning the use of these drugs in the clinical practice.",

In our previous study, SMI was shown to differentially affect CYP3A4-mediated 1'-hydroxylation and 4-hydroxylation of midazolam (MDZ). The present study was conducted to identify the active components in SMI responsible for the differential effects on MDZ metabolism, using in vitro incubation systems (rat and human liver microsomes and a recombinant CYP3A4 system) to measure 1'-hydroxylation and 4-hydroxylation of MDZ. First, different fractions of SMI were obtained by gradient elution on an solid phase extraction system and individually tested for their effects on MDZ metabolism. The results demonstrated that lipid-soluble constituents were likely to be the predominant active components of SMI. Second, the possible active components were gradually separated on an high-performance liquid chromatography system under different conditions and individually tested in vitro for their effects on MDZ metabolism. Third, the active component obtained in the above experiment was collected and subjected to structural analysis, and identified as panaxytriol (PXT). Finally, it was validated that PXT had significant differential effects on 1'-hydroxylation and 4-hydroxylation of MDZ in various in vitro systems that were similar to those of SMI. We conclude that PXT is the constituent of SMI responsible for the differential effects on CYP3A4-mediated 1'-hydroxylation and 4-hydroxylation of MDZ.",

In preclinical studies, it reduced cocaine self-administration following both acute and chronic treatment in rhesus monkeys. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of chronic buspirone treatment on self-administration of intravenous (IV) nicotine and IV nicotine+cocaine combinations. Five cocaine-experienced adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to self-administer nicotine or nicotine+cocaine combinations, and food pellets (1\u2009g) during four 1-h daily sessions under a second-order schedule of reinforcement (FR 2 (VR16:S)). Each nicotine+cocaine combination maintained significantly higher levels of drug self-administration than nicotine or cocaine alone (P<0.05-0.001).

Despite these positive outcomes, there were many methodological shortcomings in the studies reviewed, including insufficient information about randomization generation and absence of allocation concealment, lack of blinding and no placebo control, absence of intention-to-treat analysis and lack of follow-ups, selective publishing and reporting, and small number of sample sizes. A number of clinical heterogeneity such as diagnosis, intervention, control, and outcome measures were also reviewed. Only 3 trials reported adverse events, whereas the other 9 trials did not provide the safety information.", 
    "144": "Despite the apparent reported positive findings, there is insufficient evidence to support efficacy of SZRD for insomnia due to the poor methodological quality and the small number of trials of the included studies. SZRD seems generally safe, but is insufficient evidence to make conclusions on the safety because fewer studies reported the adverse events. Further large sample-size and well-designed RCTs are needed.", 
    "145": "Office-based plastic surgery procedures continue to increase in popularity and a range of anesthetic techniques can be utilized, from light conscious sedation to general anesthesia requiring intubation. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is well suited for the office environment because it allows for moderate to deep sedation without the need for intubation.",

    "147": "A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who underwent surgical procedures performed by 2 senior surgeons at American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities-certified outpatient operating rooms between 2003 and 2011. TIVA was always administered by a board-certified anesthesiologist because it required the use of propofol. Conscious sedation with midazolam and fentanyl was always administered by the plastic surgeon. Patient outcomes and complications were analyzed to assess the safety of TIVA in an office operating room.", 
    "148": "A total of 2611 procedures were performed on 2006 patients. No deaths, cardiac events, or transfers to the hospital occurred in any patients, regardless of the type of sedation utilized. Six hundred forty-two patients were given TIVA, which included propofol and/or ketamine, in addition to midazolam and fentanyl. The remaining 1364 patients received conscious sedation. There was 1 documented case (0.05%; 1/2006) of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism in a patient who had an implant exchange under TIVA; this patient was taking oral contraceptive pills at the time of surgery.", 
    "149": "Office-based surgery is an attractive option for many patients. This review suggests that a variety of procedures can be performed in a safe manner under TIVA. Although patient selection for outpatient surgery is paramount, TIVA offsets the risks of general anesthesia and is associated with minimal postoperative complications.",

    "151": "Neonatal seizures can be classified as tonic, clonic, myoclonic, and subtle. A clinical diagnosis is not easy as seizures are usually subtle in neonates. In the majority of newborn infants seizures are subclinical. On the other hand, not all abnormal movements identified by clinicians as clinical seizures are accompanied by electroencephalographic seizure discharges in the EEG. Precise incidence is difficult to delineate and depends on study population and criteria used for diagnosis of seizures. Controversy exists as to whether neonatal seizures themselves cause damage to the developing brain, or if the damage is primarily due to the underlying cause of the seizures. As a result of this controversy there is ongoing discussion whether all seizures (both clinical and subclinical) should be treated. In addition, when (sub)clinical seizures are treated, there is no consensus about the most appropriate treatment for neonatal seizures and how to assess the efficacy of treatment. Current therapeutic options to treat neonatal seizures (i.e. primarily first-generation antiepileptic drugs [AEDs]) are relatively ineffective. In practice, phenobarbital still remains the drug of first choice for EEG confirmed or suspected seizures. Benzodiazepines are also used in (phenobarbital) refractory cases. Several (small) studies indicate that lidocaine is an effective drug for refractory seizures as second- or third-line treatment. Although data are scarce, some AEDs with a wide acceptance in adult and pediatric neurology practice are being used to treat neonatal seizures (i.e. second-generation AEDs). These drugs are chemically different from all first-generation AEDs and they have an effect on other pathways so they provide new pharmacological targets for controlling seizures in newborns. Levetiracetam, topiramate, felbamate, bumetanide, lamotrigine and vigabatrin are examples of these second-generation AEDs. There is an urgent need for prospective, randomized, controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of these second-generation AEDs in neonates. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current knowledge of diagnosis, the effect on brain injury, and the treatment of neonatal seizures.",

The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential anxiolytic effect of 5TIO1 in animal models. In the elevated plus-maze test, 5TIO1 (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p) increased the time of permanence and the number of entries in the open arms. In the light/dark box test, 5TIO1 at dose of 0.1 mg/kg (i.p) also showed anxiolytic-like effect indicated by an increase in the time spent in the light box, similar to diazepam 2.0 mg/kg (i.p). 5TIO1 groups did not change locomotor and coordination activities in open field and rotarod tests, respectively, when compared to vehicle. Dose dependent process was not observed and the anxiolytic effects demonstrated were not completely reversed by flumazenil 25 mg/kg (i.p). Our results suggest that 5TIO1 can bind with other receptors, besides the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptor in mouse brain.", 
    "153": "Delirious mania is a severe but under-recognized neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by the rapid onset of delirium, mania, and psychosis, not associated with a prior toxicity, physical illness, or mental disorder. Catatonia is often a prominent feature of the syndrome. While initially believed to be rare, recent reports suggest that delirious mania may constitute up to 15% of all acute mania cases. When delirious mania is unrecognized or improperly treated, it can progress rapidly in severity and can become life-threatening. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of delirious mania and includes a detailed case report. Delirious mania is robustly responsive to high-dose lorazepam or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); thus, early recognition and definitive treatment can be life-saving.",

After 1 month on CLB, 15 patients (32.6%) became seizure-free and 10 patients (21.7%) had 50% or greater seizure reduction. Response to CLB was not significantly associated with age, sex, or etiology (symptomatic or not). Five (10.8%) of 46 patients maintained seizure remission for more than 12 months. Tolerance developed in 48.0% of initial responders, and the 3-year retention rate by the Kaplan-Meier method was 76.6%.

    "159": "Although several lines of evidence have recently implicated orexins and their receptors in fear and anxiety, there is also a growing number of apparently inconsistent and/or negative findings. In the present study, we have used ethological methods to comprehensively profile the behavioural effects of the orexin-1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 (3-30 mg/kg) in mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze. Two experiments were performed, the first involving test-na\u00efve animals and the second using prior undrugged experience of the maze to induce a qualitatively different emotional response to that seen on first exposure. In Experiment 1, a reference benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide, CDP, 15 mg/kg) produced a robust anxioselective profile comprising substantial increases in open arm exploration and reduced risk assessment without any signiifcant change in general activity levels. In contrast, SB-334867 failed to produce any behavioural effects over the dose range tested. In Experiment 2, 5 min undrugged experience of the maze 24h prior to testing increased open arm avoidance and abolished the anxiolytic efficacy of CDP. Despite this altered baseline, SB-334867 again failed to alter plus-maze behaviour. These findings agree with several recent reports that orexin receptor antagonists, such as SB-334867 and almorexant, do not alter basal anxiety levels in rats but markedly contrast with the anxiolytic-like effects of the same agents when anxiety levels have been exacerbated by fear conditioning, drug challenge or hypercapnia. This unique pattern of activity suggests that orexin receptor antagonists may have therapeutic value in those clinical anxiety disorders characterised by intense emotional arousal.", 
    "160": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurrent, anxiety-producing thoughts accompanied by unwanted, overwhelming urges to perform ritualistic behaviors. Pharmacological treatments for this disorder (serotonin uptake inhibitors) are problematic because there is a 6-8 week delayed onset and half of the patients do not adequately respond. The present study evaluated whether Ritualistic Chewing Behaviors (RCBs) induced by the serotonin agonist mCPP in the rat is a behavioral model for OCD. The effects upon the RCBs induced by mCPP (1 mg/kg) were evaluated following treatments with either the serotonin antagonist mianserin (3 mg/kg), the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (1 mg/kg), the GABA modulator diazepam (10 mg/kg), or the serotonin uptake inhibitors clomipramine and fluvoxamine (15 mg/kg). The response to mCPP was blocked by acute treatment with mianserin, but not with acute haloperidol or diazepam. Further experiments revealed that the effects of mCPP were blocked by chronic, but not acute, treatment with clomipramine and fluvoxamine. A time-course demonstrated that 14 days of chronic treatment were required for blockade of the mCPP-evoked response. The current study demonstrates that mCPP-evoked RCBs may be a rodent model for OCD that can be used to predict the clinical efficacy and time course of novel OCD treatment. Future investigations may be able to use the current model as a tool for bench-marking corresponding changes in other measures of neurological activity that may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying OCD.", 
    "161": "The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of the use of desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP) among drivers apprehended on suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) and the prevalence of the drug in post-mortem cases in Finland. Serum samples from drivers apprehended on suspicion of DUID and blood samples from post-mortem cases in Finland between October 2010 and May 2012 were analysed for the presence of desoxypipradrol. All samples were analysed for desoxypipradrol by mass spectrometric methods following comprehensive drug screening. Psychomotor performance of subjects was assessed by a clinician. There were 106 positive desoxypipradrol samples from apprehended drivers (1.7% of all confirmed DUID cases) in the study period. In most cases amphetamine and/or benzodiazepines were also present. The median (range) desoxypipradrol concentration was 0.073 mg/L (0.006-0.890 mg/L). The presence of other psychoactive drugs confounded assessment of the effect of desoxypipradrol on psychomotor performance except for one case in which it was the only drug present at pharmacologically active levels. Desoxypipradrol was found in 5 autopsy cases (0.05% of the investigated cases) and thought to contribute to death in two of these. Even though there are few data available on the pharmacology of desoxypipradrol, based on our findings, and the growing number of users, it is reasonable to assume that desoxypipradrol - a long-acting psychostimulant with dangerous side effects has an increasing detrimental impact on traffic safety in Finland. However, it was only rarely found to be the cause of death in post-mortem cases.",

We focused on hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study potential associations with renal function, comorbidity, and medication. The adjusted mortality also was determined for each electrolyte disorder.", 
    "164": "A total of 776 subjects (15.0%) had at least 1 electrolyte disorder, with hyponatremia (7.7%) and hypernatremia (3.4%) being most common. Diabetes mellitus was identified as an independent risk factor for hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia, whereas hypertension was associated with hypokalemia. Diuretics were independently associated with several electrolyte disorders: thiazide diuretics (hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), loop diuretics (hypernatremia, hypokalemia), and potassium-sparing diuretics (hyponatremia). The use of benzodiazepines also was associated with hyponatremia. Hyponatremic subjects who used both thiazides and benzodiazepines had a 3 mmol/L lower serum sodium concentration than subjects using 1 or none of these drugs (P < .001). Hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia were independently associated with an increased mortality risk.", 
    "165": "Electrolyte disorders are common among older community subjects and mainly associated with diabetes mellitus and diuretics. Subjects who used both thiazides and benzodiazepines had a more severe degree of hyponatremia. Because even mild electrolyte disorders were associated with mortality, monitoring of electrolytes and discontinuation of offending drugs may improve outcomes.", 
    "166": "Methadone may cause respiratory depression and fatalities. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines in methadone-treated patients for chronic pain or as maintenance therapy for opiate abuse is common. However, the exact contribution of benzodiazepines to methadone-induced respiratory toxicity remains debatable.", 
    "167": "We investigated the respiratory effects of the combination diazepam (20mg/kg)/methadone (5mg/kg) in the rat, focusing on methadone concentration/effect relationships. Respiratory effects were studied using arterial blood gases and whole-body plethysmography. Plasma concentrations of both R- and S-methadone enantiomers were measured using high-performance liquid chiral chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. To clarify mechanisms of diazepam/methadone interaction, methadone metabolism was investigated in vitro using rat liver microsomes.", 
    "168": "Diazepam/methadone co-administration significantly increased methadone-related effects on inspiratory time (p<0.001) but did not significantly alter the other respiratory parameters when compared with methadone alone, despite significant increase in the area under the curve of plasma R-methadone concentrations measured during 240 min (p<0.05). Diazepam/methadone co-incubation with microsomes in vitro resulted in a significant inhibition of methadone metabolism (p<0.01), with 50%-inhibitory diazepam concentrations of 25.02 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcmol/L and 25.18 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcmol/L for R- and S-methadone, respectively.",

The aim of this study was to explore if GABA(A) receptor density is altered in post-mortem brains of anxiety-prone Cloninger type 1 and socially hostile type 2 alcoholic subtypes when compared to controls. The GABA(A) binding site density was measured by whole-hemisphere autoradiography with tritium labeled flunitrazepam ([(3)H]flunitrazepam) from 17 alcoholic (nine type 1, eight type 2) and 10 non-alcoholic post-mortem brains, using cold flumazepam as a competitive ligand. A total of eight specific brain areas were examined. Alcoholics displayed a significantly (p < 0.001, bootstrap type generalizing estimating equations model) reduced [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding site density when compared to controls. When localized, type 2 alcoholics displayed a significantly (p \u2264 0.05) reduced [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding site density in the internal globus pallidus, the gyrus dentatus and the hippocampus, whereas type 1 alcoholics differed from controls in the internal globus pallidus and the hippocampus. While previous reports have demonstrated significant alterations in dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors between type 1 and type 2 alcoholics among these same subjects, we observed no statistically significant difference in [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding site densities between the Cloninger type 1 and type 2 alcoholics.",

Intravenous injection of M(2) receptor blocker gallamine produced no changes in cardiac chronotropy. In contrast, M(1) receptor blocker pirenzepine and M(3) receptor blocker 4DAMP provoked bradycardia. These data attest to the involvement of M(1) and especially M(3) cholinergic receptors in the regulation of cardiac chronotropy in rat pups, which confirms the view on pronounced species-specific and age-related peculiarities in the heart control mechanisms.", 
    "180": "Conscious sedation has been the standard of care for many years for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. As procedures have become more complex and lengthy, additional medications became essential for adequate sedation. Often time's deep sedation is required for procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiography which necessitates higher doses of narcotics and benzodiazepines or even use of other medications such as ketamine. Given its pharmacologic properties, propofol was rapidly adopted worldwide to gastrointestinal endoscopy for complex procedures and more recently to routine upper and lower endoscopy. Many studies have shown superiority for both the physician and patient compared to standard sedation. Nevertheless, its use remains highly controversial. A number of studies worldwide show that propofol can be given safely by endoscopists or nurses when well trained. Despite this wealth of data, at many centers its use has been prohibited unless administered by anesthesiology. In this commentary, we review the use of anesthesia support for endoscopy in the United States based on recent data and its implications for gastroenterologists worldwide.",

    "184": "Some second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) increase insulin resistance and fat oxidation, but counter intuitively they do not activate lipolysis. This seems unsustainable for meeting energy demands. Here, we measured dose-dependent effects of SGAs on rates of oxygen consumption (VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and physical activity in C57BL/6J mice. The role of H1-histamine receptors and consequences of blocking fat oxidation were also examined. Olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine (2.5-10mg/kg) elicited rapid drops in dark-cycle RER (~0.7) within minutes, whereas aripiprazole exerted only modest changes. Higher doses of olanzapine decreased VO2, and this was associated with accumulation of glucose in plasma. Clozapine and risperidone also lowered VO2, in contrast to aripiprazole, whereas all decreased physical activity. Astemizole and terfenadine had no significant effects on RER, VO2, or physical activity. The VO2 and RER effects appear independent of sedation/physical activity or H1-receptors. CPT-1 inhibitors can enhance muscle glucose utilization and prevent fat oxidation. However, after etomoxir (2 \u00d7 30 mg/kg), a low dose of olanzapine that did not significantly affect VO2 by itself caused precipitous drops in VO2 and body temperature, leading to death within hours or a moribund state requiring euthanasia. One 30 mg/kg dose of either etomoxir or 2-tetradecylglycidate followed by olanzapine, risperidone, or clozapine, but not aripiprazole, dramatically lowered VO2 and body temperature. Thus, mice treated with some SGAs shift their fuel utilization to mostly fat but are unable to either switch back to glucose or meet their energy demands when either higher doses are used or when fat oxidation is blocked.",

Anaesthesia was safely induced with three successive intravenous (IV) boluses of diazepam (10 mg) and ketamine (100 mg) until the trachea could be intubated. Anaesthesia was adequately maintained with isoflurane-inoxygen (mean end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 1.1% \u00b1 0.2%) on a circle anaesthetic machine with carbon dioxide absorption and an intravenous infusion of ketamine and medetomidine at a mean rate of 0.02 mg/kg/min and 0.02 \u00b5g/kg/min, respectively. Mean values recorded during anaesthesia and surgery were heart rate (56.9 \u00b1 11 beats/min), mean arterial blood pressure (6.16 kPa \u00b1 1.75 kPa), end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (6.23 kPa \u00b1 0.30 kPa). Abdominal gas distension contributed to hypoventilation that resulted in hypercapnoea, confirmed by arterial blood gas analysis (PaCO2 14.69 kPa), which required controlled ventilation for correction. Blood volume was maintained with the intravenous infusion of a balanced electrolyte solution at 10 mL/kg/h and blood pressure supported with a continuous infusion of dobutamine and phenylephrine. Duration of anaesthesia was 3.5 h. It was concluded that anaesthesia was safely induced in a compromised white rhinoceros calf with a combination of diazepam and ketamine.

Each mixture was administered intramuscularly.Under standard operating room conditions, general anaesthesia was not observed in group C (normal saline alone). In group D, sedation and muscle relaxation without complete loss of consciousness was observed. Induction time of anaesthesia in group KD was significantly quicker than group K (p &lt; 0.05). Duration of anaesthesia in group KD was significantly longer than group K (p &lt; 0.05). Recovery took longer in group KD in comparison with group K, but the difference was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). The birds in group KD were calm and sedated, with good muscle relaxation, whilst in group K the birds were excited and showed a drop in body temperature.According to the results of this study, the combination of low dose ketamine hydrochloride (HCL) and diazepam overcame the adverse effects of ketamine alone. This combination produced a more rapid induction of anaesthesia, as well as an increase in anaesthesia duration, with good muscle relaxation and a smooth and slow recovery. Use of a combination of ketamine HCL given at 10 mg/kg and diazepam given at 0.2 mg/kg for anaesthesia in pigeons is therefore recommended.", 
    "192": "The ventilatory effects of intravenous midazolam (MDZ) were evaluated in isoflurane- anaesthetised goats. Eight female goats aged 2-3 years were fasted from food and water for 12 h. Anaesthesia was then induced using a face mask with isoflurane in oxygen, whilst the trachea was intubated with a cuffed tracheal tube and anaesthesia maintained with isoflurane at 1.5% end-tidal concentration. Ventilation was spontaneous. The goats were treated with either a saline placebo (PLC) or MDZ intravenously at 0.2 mg/kg. Analysis of variance for repeated measures was used for the analysis of data. Significance was taken at the 0.05 level. Differences between treatments were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05) for tidal volume, ventilation rate, tidal volume/kg (VT/kg) and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure. Within treatments, VT and VT/kg differed 5 min after MDZ administration; this was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). The occurrence of apnoea in the MDZ-treated goats was statistically significant (p = 0.04) compared with the PLC treated goats. Intravenous MDZ at 0.2 mg/kg administered to isoflurane-anaesthetised goats may result in transient apnoea and a mild decrease in VT and VT/kg."
