To investigate the association between treatment-emergent weight gain and therapeutic improvement across placebo and active treatments, and to examine the association between reported treatment-emergent weight changes and the treatments' reported efficacy. Data from a randomized, double-blind trial comparing treatment of schizophrenia with placebo and olanzapine were used to correlate weight change and change in psychopathology. Additionally, we correlated effect sizes of the efficacy of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol and placebo (reported in meta-analytical reviews), with their reported weight changes. Weight gain significantly correlated with clinical improvements for placebo and olanzapine. The correlation between treatments' efficacy and corresponding weight changes was high (r 0.88, p 0.05). Treatment-emergent weight gain appears to be an important marker of symptom reduction, and may not be exclusively attributable to pharmacological perturbations.", 
    "1": "Verbal and physical aggressive behaviours are among the most disturbing and distressing behaviours displayed by older patients in long-term care facilities. Aggressive behaviour (AB) is often the reason for using physical or chemical restraints with nursing home residents and is a major concern for caregivers. AB is associated with increased health care costs due to staff turnover and absenteeism.", 
    "2": "The goals of this secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study are to determine the prevalence of verbal and physical aggressive behaviours and to identify associated factors among older adults in long-term care facilities in the Quebec City area (n = 2,332).", 
    "3": "The same percentage of older adults displayed physical aggressive behaviour (21.2%) or verbal aggressive behaviour (21.5%), whereas 11.2% displayed both types of aggressive behaviour. Factors associated with aggressive behaviour (both verbal and physical) were male gender, neuroleptic drug use, mild and severe cognitive impairment, insomnia, psychological distress, and physical restraints. Factors associated with physical aggressive behaviour were older age, male gender, neuroleptic drug use, mild or severe cognitive impairment, insomnia and psychological distress. Finally, factors associated with verbal aggressive behaviour were benzodiazepine and neuroleptic drug use, functional dependency, mild or severe cognitive impairment and insomnia.", 
    "4": "Cognitive impairment severity is the most significant predisposing factor for aggressive behaviour among older adults in long-term care facilities in the Quebec City area. Physical and chemical restraints were also significantly associated with AB. Based on these results, we suggest that caregivers should provide care to older adults with AB using approaches such as the progressively lowered stress threshold model and reactance theory which stress the importance of paying attention to the severity of cognitive impairment and avoiding the use of chemical or physical restraints.", 
    "5": "Acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder require rapid and effective relief. Bipolar depression is a major component of the bipolar disorder spectrum. Existing treatment options for bipolar depression include lithium, lamotrigine and conventional antidepressants. However, lithium is more effective in treating mania or hypomania than depression, both acutely and prophylactically, lamotrigine has only been demonstrated to be effective in one adequately powered study in acute bipolar I depression, and conventional antidepressants have been associated with emergent mania and cycle acceleration. Symptomatic outpatients can expect to spend, on average, 33% of their time in the depressive phase compared with 11% in the manic phase. Consequently, there is a need for additional agents to effectively treat bipolar depression. The atypical agents olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine have demonstrated efficacy against the manic phase of bipolar disorder and appear also to have potential in the depressive phase. Olanzapine monotherapy significantly improved depressive symptoms compared with placebo in patients with bipolar disorder in an 8-week randomized, controlled clinical study, but the magnitude of the clinical effect was small. The observed improvement in depressive symptoms became moderately large when olanzapine was combined with the antidepressant fluoxetine. Quetiapine monotherapy also resulted in significant improvements compared with placebo in patients with either bipolar I or bipolar II disorder in another 8-week randomized, controlled clinical study, but the effect size was large. A 6-month open-label study of risperidone added to ongoing therapy demonstrated improvements in depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders experiencing a manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive episode. The receptor-binding profile of these agents supports a role in the treatment of depressive symptoms and clinical data are beginning to emerge of their efficacy in both the acute and maintenance setting.", 
    "6": "There is increasing evidence that compounds with selectivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) alpha2- and/or alpha3-subtypes may retain the desirable anxiolytic activity of nonselective benzodiazepines but possess an improved side effect profile. Herein we describe a novel series of GABA(A) alpha2/alpha3 subtype-selective agonists leading to the identification of the development candidate 17, a nonsedating anxiolytic in preclinical animal assays.", 
    "7": "The effects of (R)- and (S)-ibuprofen on the binding of benzodiazepines to human serum albumin (HSA) were examined by biointeraction chromatography. The displacement of benzodiazepines from HSA by (R)- and (S)-ibuprofen was found to involve negative allosteric interactions (or possible direct competition) for most (R)-benzodiazepines. However, (S)-benzodiazepines gave positive or negative allosteric effects and direct competition when displaced by (R)- or (S)-ibuprofen. Association equilibrium constants and coupling constants measured for these effects indicated that they involved two classes of ibuprofen binding regions (i.e., low- and high-affinity sites). Based on these results, a model was proposed to explain the binding of benzodiazepines to HSA and their interactions with ibuprofen. This model gave good agreement with previous reports examining the binding of benzodiazepines to HSA.",

We undertook this study to assess the sedative drug doses administered during bronchoscopy in lung transplant recipients and to assess if there is a change in the dosage requirements over time following lung transplantation.", 
    "9": "In all, 773 transbronchial biopsy procedures performed via flexible bronchoscopy were analyzed in 140 consecutive lung transplant recipients. Conscious sedation was achieved with intermittent boluses of intravenous midazolam and fentanyl. Intravenous propofol boluses of 10 to 30 mg were administered when optimal sedation was not achieved with midazolam doses of 0.20 to 0.25 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 to 2.5 micrograms/kg.", 
    "10": "Mean doses of midazolam and fentanyl administered were 0.15+/-0.07 mg/kg (range 0.02 to 0.44 mg/kg) and 1.8+/-0.8 micrograms/kg (range 0.1 to 6.67 micrograms/kg) respectively. Midazolam and fentanyl doses administered to patients with cystic fibrosis were the highest compared to those with other disease types (P<0.0001). Examining the sedative doses administered over time following transplantation, there was a significant linear (P<0.001) and quadratic (P=0.0023) effect of time for midazolam and a significant linear (P=0.003) and a trend (P=0.08) for a quadratic effect for fentanyl. Propofol was effectively used in seven lung transplant recipients in whom adequate sedation could not be achieved with high doses of midazolam and fentanyl.",

This variation in sedation practice is greater than any other culturally based variation in the technical performance of endoscopy. This article sequentially reviews the technical performance of colonoscopy in patients who undergo unsedated colonoscopy, sedation with narcotics and benzodiazepines, and deep sedation with propofol. For each of these approaches to colonoscopy, the advantages and disadvantages also are listed and discussed.", 
    "13": "Status epilepticus and encephalopathy have been reported with use of cephalosporins in patients with renal failure. We here report the case of a 79-year-old patient with normal renal function who developed subtle mental status changes during cefepime therapy for urinary tract infection. Emergent electroencephalography revealed evidence of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), which responded initially to lorazepam. Later, the patient's NCSE gradually resolved only after cefepime was discontinued, with mental status returning to baseline as the electroencephalography changes resolved. It should be recognized that cefepime therapy can cause NCSE even in the presence of normal renal function. Measurement of serum concentrations and changes in dosing guidelines can probably prevent NCSE during cefepime therapy.", 
    "14": "In cerebellum, 75% of all GABAA receptors contain alpha1 subunits. Here, we investigated compensatory changes in GABAA receptor subunit expression and composition in alpha1 subunit-knockout mice. In these mice the total number of cerebellar GABAA receptors was reduced by 46%. Whereas the number of receptors containing alpha6 subunits was unchanged, the total amount of alpha6 subunits was significantly elevated. RT-PCR showed no increase of alpha6 mRNA levels, arguing against increased biosynthesis of these subunits. Elevated levels of alpha6 subunits in alpha1 -/- mice might thus have been caused by an increased incorporation of unassembled alpha6 subunits, replacing alpha1 subunits in alpha1alpha6betagamma2 or alpha1alpha6betadelta receptors, thus rescuing alpha6 subunits from degradation. Elevated levels of alpha3 and alpha4 subunits in the cerebellum of alpha1 -/- mice possibly can be explained similarly. Finally, a small amount of receptors containing no gamma or delta subunits was identified in these mice. Results suggest a total loss of GABAA receptors in cell types where alpha1 was the only alpha subunit expressed and a partial compensation for receptor loss in cell types containing other alpha subunits. Our results do not support a significant compensatory synthesis of other GABAA receptor subunits in the cerebellum of alpha1 -/- mice.", 
    "15": "The toxicity of a series of GABAlytics (11 drugs) representing different pharmacological groups was evaluated in comparative experiments on Daphnia magna Straus and white mice. A high degree of correlation was established between the toxicity of GABA antagonists studied in daphnia and mice. The pharmacological analysis of the interaction of agonists and antagonists of GABA/benzodiazepine/ionophore-receptor complex--the competitive ligands for various binding sites--was carried out. It is suggested that the ability of GABA agonists to prevent the action of GABA antagonists in whole organism is mainly determined by their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features, rather than by direct competition for binding sites within the receptor complex.", 
    "16": "Interceptive stimulus properties of mexidol (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and phenazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) were compared using the standard operant model of liquid-reinforced drug discrimination (DD) procedure in male albino rats. Successful DD development has been shown in 100% of phenazepam-pretreated rats, while only 10% of mexidol-treated animals demonstrated DD. In the case of a high stimulus control, both mexidol and phenazepam DD manifestations showed high reproducibility (not less than 80% adequate reactions) and stability. The results suggest that mexidol, while possessing interceptive stimulus properties, belongs to the group of moderately discriminated psychotropic drugs.",

    "18": "In this observational study, the charts of all consecutive patients undergoing mechanical ventilation requiring tracheotomy over a 14-month period in our 18-bed tertiary care ICU were reviewed retrospectively. Patients' sedation levels (according to the Riker's 7-level sedation-agitation score) and intravenous (fentanyl and midazolam) and oral (clorazepate and haloperidol) sedative administration were measured daily during the 7 days before and after tracheotomy. We also recorded patients for whom chair positioning and oral alimentation became possible in the days following tracheotomy.", 
    "19": "None.", 
    "20": "Tracheotomy was performed on 72 (23.1%) of the 312 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for > or = 48 hrs. After tracheotomy, median (25th, 75th percentiles) fentanyl and midazolam administration decreased from 866 (191, 1672) to 71 (3, 426) microg/(patient.day) and from 44 (16, 128) to 7 (1, 42) mg/(patient.day) (p < .001), respectively. Concomitant median time spent heavily sedated decreased from 7 (3, 17) to 1 (0, 6) hrs/day (p < .001), with no increase in agitation time. During the 7 days following tracheotomy, partial oral alimentation became possible for 35 patients (48.6%) and out-of-bed positioning became possible for 16 patients (22.2%).", 
    "21": "On the basis of these observations, we conclude that tracheotomized mechanically ventilated ICU patients required less intravenous sedative administration, spent less time heavily sedated, and achieved more autonomy earlier.", 
    "22": "Reported are three patients with ictal monoparesis of an arm. In the hemisphere contralateral to the monoparesis, ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the centroparietal area, and a well-circumscribed lesion was commonly present in the primary arm somatosensory area (SI). In the presence of an SI lesion, the epileptic activity at the sensorimotor area could lead to selective or predominant activation of the inhibitory motor system.", 
    "23": "To assess the molecular effects of the antiepileptic drug clobazam (CLB, 1,5-benzodiazepine), a benzodiazepine effective in the management of epilepsy, we performed a series of experiments using rats with chronic, spontaneous recurrent seizures induced by amygdalar injection of FeCl(3). Experimental animals were treated for 14 days with CLB. We then measured the expression of glutamate and GABA transporter proteins and evaluated the changes that occurred in these proteins using both experimental and control animals. CLB treatment was associated with an increase in the production of GLT-1 in the contra-lateral hippocampus of animals receiving amygdalar FeCl(3) and CLB treatment. CLB treatment up-regulated the GABA transporter GAT3 in the contra-lateral hippocampus of animals with chronic, recurrent seizures. In contrast, CLB had no effect on the expression of EAAC1 and GAT1 in the hippocampus or the cortex in control animal groups. Chronic epileptogenesis may be associated with down-regulation of the production of glial excitatory amino acid transporters, GLAST and GLT-1, proteins that cause increase in the basal extracellular concentrations of glutamate. Elevated GABA transporter expression results in increased reverse transport of GABA to the extracellular space during periods of excitation. In addition to allosteric activation of GABA(A) receptors, this study suggests that CLB might exhibit its antiepileptic action by increasing GLT-1 expression and GAT3 in the hippocampus of rats with chronic seizures.", 
    "24": "The incidence of convulsive status epilepticus in children is approximately 20-50/100,000/year, and is an emergency requiring prompt medical intervention. Prolonged seizures lasting over 5 min are unlikely to stop spontaneously, and time-to-treatment influences treatment response. Prolonged seizures should thus be treated as early status epilepticus. Mortality and morbidity increase significantly with the length of ongoing seizure activity, especially after 60 min. Benzodiazepines remain the first-line drug therapy due to their rapid onset of action. Recent studies imply that buccal midazolam is more effective and easier to administer than rectal diazepam. Phenytoin/fosphenytoin and phenobarbital administered intravenously remain the second-line treatments of choice, whilst barbiturates and midazolam as intravenous anesthetics are used for third-line treatment. Electroencephalogram monitoring is essential to evaluate the electrophysiologic treatment response and depth of anesthesia, especially in refractory status epilepticus. In the future, more individualized protocols and pathways are needed in order to optimize treatment responses. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate new treatment protocols, which should not only stop the seizures more effectively but also be safer and include some neuroprotective elements to halt the cascade of neuronal injury and minimize the risk for neurologic morbidity caused by the convulsive status epilepticus.", 
    "25": "The point mutation H101R in the alpha1-subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors is known to abolish effects by benzodiazepine diazepam. This mutation and homologous mutations in other alpha-subunits have been used to quantify receptor pentamers containing two different alpha-subunit isoforms, and to study the role of alpha-subunit isoforms in the response of mice to diazepam. Both types of study assumed implicitly or explicitly that this mutation strongly affects assembly with the gamma2-subunit. Here, we investigated the assembly properties of mutated in comparison with wild-type subunits, and demonstrate that alpha1H101R has similar assembly properties as wild-type alpha1.", 
    "26": "Motor function abnormalities are a key feature of cerebral palsy. Spasticity is one of the main motor abnormalities seen in children with cerebral palsy. Spasticity is a velocity dependent increased resistance to movement. While in some children, spasticity may adversely impact the motor abilities, in others, it may help maintain posture and ability to ambulate. Thus, treatment to reduce spasticity requires careful consideration of various factors. Non-pharmacologic interventions used to reduce spasticity include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, use of adaptive equipment, various orthopedic surgical procedures and neurosurgical procedures. Pharmacologic interventions used for reducing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy reviewed in this article include oral administration of baclofen, diazepam, dantrolene and tizanidine, intrathecal baclofen, and local injections of botulinum toxin, phenol, and alcohol.", 
    "27": "GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha(1), beta(2), gamma(1) subunits are expressed in only a few areas of the brain and thus represent interesting drug targets. The pharmacological properties of this receptor subtype, however, are largely unknown. In the present study, we expressed alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(1)-GABA(A) receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzed their modulation by 21 ligands from 12 structural classes making use of the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method and a fast perfusion system. Modulation of GABA-induced chloride currents (I(GABA)) was studied at GABA concentrations eliciting 5 to 10% of the maximal response. Triazolam, clotiazepam, midazolam, 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10-octahydro-cyclohepta-(b)pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyridin-3-one (CGS 20625), 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-one (CGS 9896), diazepam, zolpidem, and bretazenil at 1 microM concentrations were able to significantly (>20%) enhance I(GABA) in alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(1) receptors. Methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, 3-methyl-6-[3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine (Cl 218,872), clobazam, flumazenil, 5-(6-ethyl-7-methoxy-5-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)-3-methyl-[1,2,4]-oxadiazole (Ru 33203), 2-phenyl-4-(3-ethyl-piperidinyl)-quinoline (PK 9084), flurazepam, ethyl-7-methoxy-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate (l-655,708), 2-(6-ethyl-7-methoxy-5-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)-4-methyl-thiazole (Ru 33356), and 6-ethyl-7-methoxy-5-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)phenylmethanone (Ru 32698) (1 microM each) had no significant effect, and flunitrazepam and 2-phenyl-4-(4-ethyl-piperidinyl)-quinoline (PK 8165) inhibited I(GABA). The most potent compounds triazolam, clotiazepam, midazolam, and CGS 20625 were investigated in more detail on alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(1) and alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) receptors. The potency and efficiency of these compounds for modulating I(GABA) was smaller for alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(1) than for alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) receptors, and their effects on alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(1) could not be blocked by flumazenil. CGS 20625 displayed the highest efficiency by enhancing at 100 microM I(GABA) (alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)) by 775 +/- 17% versus 526 +/- 14% I(GABA) (alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(1)) and 157 +/- 17% I(GABA) (alpha(1)beta(2)) (p < 0.05). These data provide new insight into the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors containing gamma(1) subunits and may aid in the design of specific ligands for this receptor subtype.", 
    "28": "Nonhuman and human studies have shown that benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor agonists can modify aggressive behaviour. However, it is unknown whether flumazenil, a BZD receptor antagonist, enhances or inhibits aggressive behaviour. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of acute administrations of flumazenil on aggressive responding in adult humans. Six adult males with histories of childhood conduct disorder (DSM IV R) participated in experimental sessions. Aggression was measured using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP; Cherek 1992), which provided subjects with aggressive and monetary-reinforced response options. Acute doses of flumazenil (2 and 3mg) did not produce statistically significant changes in either monetary-reinforced responding or aggressive responding. The analysis of individual subjects data revealed that aggressive responses varied across subjects. The results are discussed in terms of individual differences based on the previous history of BZD abuse. Additional laboratory research is needed to better clarify the behavioural mechanisms by which BZD receptor antagonists modify human aggressive responding.", 
    "29": "Gender differences in the discriminative stimulus properties of drugs of abuse have sometimes been reported, although we have previously found no differences in subjective or discriminative responses in human subjects acquiring an alcohol discrimination. The aim of the present work was to determine if there were gender differences in the effects of lorazepam, a benzodiazepine-receptor agonist which substituted for the alcohol stimulus in trained social drinkers. Volunteers who had already acquired an alcohol (0.2g/kg) placebo discrimination were administered (double-blind) either placebo (nine females, nine males) or lorazepam 2mg (six females, six males). They then sampled a series of five drinks and rated each one for likeness to the training stimulus (the generalization response). In addition they completed rating scales for subjective effects and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Lorazepam substituted for the alcohol stimulus equally in both sexes and increased associated scores for lightheadedness. Females however, showed a much greater DSST performance impairment following lorazepam, compared with males. This effect was independent of body weight differences and sedation. These results are discussed in the light of current knowledge of gender differences in response to drugs of abuse and suggest that the stimulus and cognitive effects of benzodiazepine-receptor agonists are modulated by different brain mechanisms.", 
    "30": "Centrally mediated seizures and convulsions are common consequences of exposure to organophosphates (OPs). These seizures rapidly progress to status epilepticus (SE) and contribute to profound brain injury. Effective management of these seizures is critical for minimization of brain damage. Nasal application of midazolam (1.5 mg/kg) after 5 min of sarin-induced electrographic seizure activity (EGSA) ameliorated EGSA and convulsive behavior (238 +/- 90 s). Identical treatment after 30 min was not sufficient to ameliorate ECoG paradoxical activity and convulsive behavior. Nasal midazolam (1.5 mg/kg), together with scopolamine (1 mg/kg, im) after 5 min of EGSA, exerted a powerful and rapid anticonvulsant effect (53 +/- 10 s). Delaying the same treatment to 30 min of EGSA leads to attenuation of paroxysmal ECoG activity in all cases but total cessation of paroxysmal activity was not observed in most animals tested. Cognitive tests utilizing the Morris Water Maze demonstrated that nasal midazolam alone or together with scopolamine (im), administered after 5 min of convulsions, abolished the effect of sarin on learning. Both these treatments, when given after 30 min of convulsions, only decreased the sarin-induced learning impairments. Whereas rats which were not subject to the anticonvulsant agents did not show any memory for the platform location, both treatments (at 5 min as well as at 30 min) completely abolished the memory deficits. Both treatments equally blocked the impairment of reversal learning when given at 5 min. However, when administered after 30 min, midazolam alone reversed the impairments in reversal learning, while midazolam with scopolamine did not. Rats exposed to sarin and treated with the therapeutic regimen with the exclusion of midazolam exhibited severe brain lesions that encountered the hippocampus, pyriform cortex, and thalamus. Nasal midazolam at 5 min prevented brain damage, while delaying the midazolam treatment to 30 min of EGSA resulted in brain damage. The addition of scopolamine to midazolam did not alter the above observation. In summary, nasal midazolam treatment briefly after initiation of OP-induced seizure leads to cessation of EGSA and prevented brain lesions and behavioral deficiencies in the rat model.", 
    "31": "Mouse pleurisy induced by carrageenan is used to determine the mechanism of anti-inflammatory action of 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2 (Ro5-4864). Pre-treatment with Ro5-4864 inhibits different inflammatory parameters, such as neutrophil influx, MPO activity and NO levels in the early phase (4 h), as well as mononuclear cells and ADA activity in the late phase (48 h) of pleurisy. dl-Aminoglutethimide, inhibitor of steroidal synthesis, reverted the effect of Ro5-4864 on these different inflammatory parameters. Our results suggest that anti-inflammatory action of Ro5-4864 may be partly due to its capacity to inhibit leukocyte migration, as well as leukocyte activation and formation of NO by a mechanism dependent on glucocorticoids.", 
    "32": "Even though propofol has better recovery profile than traditional agents, its use is limited because of the perception of increased complication rates.

Of these, 634 received propofol, and 527 received midazolam, meperidine, and/or fentanyl. Most of the included studies were randomized trials of moderate quality and nonsignificant heterogeneity (Cochran Q = 4.81, P = .90). Compared with traditional sedative agents, the pooled odds ratio with the use of propofol for developing hypoxia or hypotension for all the procedures combined was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-1.24); for EGD, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.33-2.17); for colonoscopy, 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.79); and for ERCP/EUS, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.38-3.01).",

    "36": "Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed to juvenile psychiatric patients, though their cerebral effects during development are incompletely described. Accordingly, we studied the effects of repeated treatment with dissimilar antipsychotic drugs on dopamine (DA) receptors in juvenile vs. adult rats. Tissue levels of DA receptor types (D1, D2, D3, and D4) in forebrain regions of juvenile rats were quantified after 3 weeks of daily treatment with representative first- (fluphenazine) and second-generation (clozapine and olanzapine) antipsychotics, and compared with similarly treated adult rats examined in previous studies. Fluphenazine, clozapine, and olanzapine all decreased D1 receptors in dorsolateral frontal and medial prefrontal cortex (MPC) of juvenile, but not adult rats. Conversely, all three test agents increased D2 labeling in MPC of adult, but not young animals. Fluphenazine and olanzapine, but not clozapine, also increased D2 receptor levels in hippocampus, and D4 levels in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate-putamen (CPu) in both juvenile and adult brain. D3 receptors were not altered by any treatment in any brain region at either age. Only some DA receptor adaptations to antipsychotic treatment are shared by developing and mature animals. Developmental differences in DA receptor responses may account for differences in clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs between young and adult psychiatric patients.", 
    "37": "Concomitant abuse of buprenorphine (BPN) and benzodiazepines (BZD) may relate to a pharmacodynamic interaction between the two. The objective of the present work was to investigate the acute and chronic effects of clorazepate (CRZ) alone or in combination with BPN on selective kappa opiate tritiated ligand [3H]-U69 593 and delta opiate radioligand [3H]-deltorphine II binding in the rat brain. Bmax (maximal receptor density) and Kd (the dissociation constant) were directly determined at different brain regions of interest (ROI) selected for high densities of kappa and/or delta receptors in rats treated with BPN and/or CRZ. The agents were administered either once or for 21 consecutive days. Differences in Bmax and Kd (for both specific ligands) were related to drug treatment and receptor location. Globally, single BPN administration induced no changes in kappa or delta opiate receptor binding, whereas repeated BPN administration up-regulated kappa receptor density and decreased delta affinity. At the kappa receptor level, repeated administration of CRZ acted only on Kd, whereas the delta receptor was up-regulated. Repeated addition of CRZ to BPN had no effect on kappa receptor Bmax versus chronic controls. By significantly decreasing Bmax, CRZ nullified the effect of chronic BPN on the kappa receptor. The modifications were strongest in the nucleus accumbens, where both types of receptor occur. Treatments had region-selective effects in some brain areas, such as the amygdala, periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus and caudate putamen. Increased mu and delta receptor densities would be expected to provide reinforcement by enhancing reward, and impairment of kappa receptor availability would be expected to decrease aversion. The effects described are likely to influence addictive behavior among people abusing BZD and BPN.",

Statistics show that about 85% of all blood samples sent for toxicological analysis have one or more banned substances present. Amphetamine is by far the leading drug of abuse in Sweden and was identified in about 50-60% of all DUID suspects either alone or together with other controlled substances. The next most frequently encountered illicit drug was tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), with positive findings in about 20-25% of cases. Various prescription drugs, mainly sedative-hypnotics like diazepam and flunitrazepam, were also highly prevalent and these occurred mostly together with illicit substances. Opiates, such as 6-acetyl morphine and morphine, the metabolites of heroin, were high on the list of substances identified. Most DUID suspects in Sweden were men (85%) who were poly-drug users combining illicit substances, like amphetamine and/or cannabis, with a prescription medication such as various benzodiazepines.", 
    "42": "Sweden's zero-concentration limit has done nothing to reduce DUID or deter the typical offender because recidivism is high in this population of individuals (40-50%). Indeed, many traffic delinquents in Sweden are criminal elements in society with previous convictions for drunk and/or drugged driving as well as other offenses. The spectrum of drugs identified in blood samples from DUID suspects has not changed much since the zero-limit law was introduced.", 
    "43": "Benzodiazepine binding sites are present on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in hippocampal neurons. Diazepam is known to potentiate the amplitude and prolong the decay of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In this study, benzodiazepine involvement in long-term potentiation (LTP) of the IPSC was examined. Whole-cell recordings of IPSCs were made from rat hippocampal CA1 neurons in a slice preparation. LTP was induced by a tetanic stimulation in the stratum radiatum (2 trains of 100 Hz for 1 s, 20 s inter-train interval) while pharmacologically blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors. During LTP, the amplitude of the IPSCs was potentiated in the majority of neurons with the IPSC decay and shape unaffected. Diazepam (5 microM) potentiated the IPSC amplitude and prolonged the decay when applied before, but not during, LTP. In neurons in which LTP could not be induced by a tetanic stimulation, diazepam did not increase the amplitude of the pre-tetanic IPSC. Flumazenil, at a concentration (10 microM) that blocked the enhancement of the IPSC by applied diazepam, had no effect on the IPSC amplitude when applied before LTP induction but significantly decreased the IPSC when applied during LTP maintenance. The antagonist, when applied during the tetanic stimulation, did not block LTP, suggesting that benzodiazepine receptors do not participate in LTP induction. These results indicate that the maintenance of LTP of the IPSC involves (a) the release of endogenous benzodiazepine agonist(s) and/or (b) the participation of benzodiazepine binding sites on subsynaptic GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "44": "Classical benzodiazepines (BZs) are the most widely prescribed drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS). They exert their therapeutic effects via binding to the BZ-site of GABAA receptors, and allosterically modulating the chloride flux through the ion channel complex. Given the multiple actions of classical BZs, the serious limitations to their usefulness have directed much research into development of novel ligands for the BZ-site with retained therapeutic effectiveness and minimal side effects. From the studies of CNS-active chemical constituents of medicinal herbs, some members of the family of flavonoids were demonstrated to have moderate binding affinities for the BZ-site. In vivo studies revealed that these compounds were mostly partial agonists of GABAA receptors, and only a few flavonoids were shown to possess antagonistic activities. At effective anxiolytic doses, the actions of partial agonistic flavonoids were often not accompanied by sedative and myorelaxant side effects. Based on structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, incorporation of electronegative groups to the C6 and C3' on the flavone backbone was found to yield significant increases in the binding affinities for the BZ-site. It was also shown that 2'-hydroxyl was a critical moiety on flavonoids with regard to BZ-site binding. These have guided the identification of several synthetic flavonoids with high BZ-site binding affinity and in vivo activity, and further quantitative SAR studies resulted in the development of several pharmacophore models. This review attempts to summarize these findings, which has led to the establishment of flavonoids as potential therapeutics for GABAA receptor-mediated disorders.", 
    "45": "Alprazolam (Xanax) is used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks, and is subject to abuse. The objective of this study was to describe the patterns of alprazolam abuse and drug identification (ID) calls received by several poison control centers. Cases were alprazolam calls received by 6 poison control centers during 1998-2004. Of 25,954 alprazolam calls received, 42% were drug ID calls and 51% were human exposure calls, of which 18% were abuse calls. The number of drug ID calls and the number of abuse calls both increased during the 7-yr period. Male patients accounted for 54% of abuse calls and females for 66% of nonabuse calls. Adolescent patients comprised 43% of abuse calls but only 12% of nonabuse calls. Although the majority of both types of human exposures occurred at the patient's own residence, abuse exposures were more likely than other exposures to occur at school (9% vs. 1%) and public areas (6% vs. 1%). While abuse calls were less likely than nonabuse calls to have no adverse clinical effects (19% vs. 23%), they were more likely to have minor medical outcomes (60% vs. 50%). Alprazolam abuse in Texas appears to be increasing. Alprazolam abusers are more likely to be male and often adolescent. Alprazolam abuse as compared to other exposures is more likely to occur outside of the person's home. Alprazolam abuse is more likely to involve some sort of adverse medical outcome.",

Ultrastructurally, they display numerous and very characteristic secretory organelles: granules, secretory vesicles and microvesicles. This paper focuses on the impact of the gastrin/CCK2 receptor on the ultrastructure of the ECL cells. The effects of pharmacological blockade of the receptor are compared with the effects of receptor elimination following selective gene targeting. Long-term administration of powerful gastrin/CCK2 receptor antagonists was found to induce hypotrophy of rat stomach ECL cells with reduced number of granules, secretory vesicles and microvesicles. In gastrin/CCK2 receptor knockout mice ECL cells, i.e., histamine-storing cells with the characteristic ultrastructure of ECL cells, had disappeared from the oxyntic mucosa and been replaced by a novel population of endocrine-like cells. These cells harbored granules and microvesicles, but were devoid of histamine and secretory vesicles. We suggest that the gastrin/CCK2 receptor is important for the proper differentiation of the ECL cells and for maintaining their characteristic ultrastructure.",

    "64": "Some reports of impaired glucose tolerance associated with olanzapine (OLZ) treatment have been published before OLZ was marketed in Japan. In Japan, we have been prohibited from using OLZ for patients with diabetes mellitus, since several cases with OLZ-associated impaired glucose tolerance including two deaths from diabetic coma have been reported. Here, we report four cases of OLZ-associated impaired glucose tolerance and review the points to consider in treatment with OLZ. Of our four cases, three cases were new-onset (non diabetes mellitus cases) and the other case was a diabetes mellitus-existent (diabetes mellitus case). In the non DM cases, the time to the onset of impaired glucose tolerance after initiating treatment with OLZ was 8-9 months, and the impaired glucose tolerance immediately improved after discontinuing treatment with OLZ and initiating treatment for diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is necessary to continue long-term monitoring of the parameters of glucose metabolism for all patients treated with OLZ. Should impaired glucose tolerance develop during treatment with OLZ, treatment with OLZ should be discontinued immediately and treatment for diabetes mellitus should be started if necessary. Although the condition of diabetes mellitus was stable befor initiating treatment with OLZ in the DM case, hyperglycemia developed immediately after initiating treatment with OLZ and the condition remained unstable even after early treatment for diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is necessary to check for a previous history of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia befor initiating treatment with OLZ. Correlations between weight gain and occurrence of impaired glucose tolerance are not clear, so it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of impaired glucose tolerance even in cases without weight gain.", 
    "65": "The mechanism of action of benzodiazepines and ethanol demonstrates that these agents can synergistically affect the central nervous system (CNS). The effects of both ethanol and diazepam are likely to depend on the time of the day when they were administered. Diazepam influence on ethanol-induced sleeping and hypothermic activity in mice as well as the influence of combined administration of these agents on spontaneous locomotor activity and coordination in mice (rota-rod) were investigated. Experiments were carried out in the light phase (10:00-12:00 h) and the dark phase (22:00-24:00 h). It was shown that ethanol-induced sleeping time was longer in the dark phase than the light phase, and that ethanol increased spontaneous locomotor activity both in the light and the dark. Ethanol-induced hypothermia was lower in the dark than in the light. Diazepam decreased locomotor activity more strongly in the dark phase than by day. It impaired the hypothermic action of ethanol in the light phase, but did not have such an effect in the dark phase. Diazepam prolonged ethanol-induced sleep in the light phase, enhanced its action on locomotor coordination and decreased the stimulating effect of ethanol on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The chronobiological effect of the interaction between diazepam and ethanol seems to be of practical importance (sleep and motor coordination).",

PBR activation was reported to decrease innate immunity and host defense. The present experiment was designed to analyze the effects of diazepam on Ehrlich tumor growth, and on macrophage activity of Ehrlich tumor bearing mice. Results showed that diazepam (3.0 mg/kg/day, for 7 days) increased the number of Ehrlich tumor cells and the volume of tumor-induced ascitic fluid. These effects were not observed after smaller doses of diazepam, suggesting a dose-dependant effect. Furthermore, our results show that 3.0 mg/kg of diazepam, administered daily, for 2 days, decreased (1) the number of peritoneal leukocytes retrieved after injection of the Ehrlich tumor, (2) the percents of macrophage spreading, and (3) the levels of macrophage NO production. Diazepam (3.0 mg/kg/day for 2 days) had no effect on macrophage phagocytosis or on H2O2 production. The present data is discussed based on a direct and/or indirect action of diazepam. Particularly, our findings might be due to a direct effect of diazepam on PBRs present on macrophages and tumor cells, or could still be mediated by PBR stimulation within the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.", 
    "71": "Brief, unprotected exposure of rats to cats (predator stress) may be lastingly anxiogenic in a variety of tests of rodent anxiety. Recent findings suggest that predator stress induced plasticity in neural circuitry implicated in fear learning underlies some of these anxiogenic effects. In addition, recent work implicates a consolidation-like process in the impact of predator stress on anxiety in that effects of predator stress may be interrupted by immediate post stressor pharmacological interventions. The present study tested whether \"consolidation\" of the anxiogenic effects of predator stress were dependent on protein synthesis. In addition, the study examined whether a protein synthesis dependent reconsolidation-like process was at work when rats were exposed to a cat twice. Anisomycin (210 mg/kg) or vehicle (Tween 80 in saline) was injected subcutaneously 1 min after a single cat exposure (consolidation test paradigm) or a 1 min after a second cat exposure (reconsolidation test paradigm) and behavior tested 7-8 days after predator stress. In the consolidation test paradigm, anisomycin blocked the anxiogenic effects of predator stress in the elevated plus maze (EPM) measured with open arm exploration. Moreover, anisomycin blocked the potentiation of startle by predator stress when rats were startled in the light, but not when startled in the dark. In contrast, the delay of habituation of startle produced by predator stress was unaffected by anisomycin. Suppression of risk assessment in the EPM by predator stress was not affected by anisomycin either. In startle testing, vehicle injection 1 min after predator stress led to a lasting suppression, rather than enhancement of startle response. Vehicle plus predator stress enhanced and prolonged corticosterone level changes sampled over 30-180 min after treatment when compared to handled or predator stressed only rats. In addition, predator stress plus vehicle suppression of startle was blocked by a benzodiazepine anxiolytic (chloradiazepoxide) or the glucorticoid receptor (GR) blocker RU486. Both drugs returned startle to the predator stressed only heightened levels. It is argued that an added anxiogenic effect of vehicle injection plus predator stress leads to a suppression, rather than enhancement of startle. Startle suppression appears to be mediated, in part, by activation of GR by corticosterone which engages a protein synthesis dependent process, since anisomycin blocked the startle suppressive effects of vehicle. Startle suppression also appeared to be independent of the startle enhancing effect of predator stress and in competition with it. Since predator stress may model aspects of hyperarousal associated with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), implications of these findings for understanding of mechanisms of initiation of the disorder and for treatment are discussed.", 
    "72": "Compounds which modulate AMPA receptor function through allosteric mechanisms were examined for their effect on the binding of the agonist [3H]fluorowillardiine (FW). Benzamide-type positive modulators (ampakinestrade mark) under all experimental circumstances increased [3H]FW binding to native receptors in rat brain membranes. Benzothiadiazide drugs had more variable effects ranging from large reductions with cyclothiazide and JM-13 to increases produced by more recent compounds like PEPA, D1 and LY392098. These effects on binding were moderately influenced by the assay conditions, including temperature and the presence or absence of thiocyanate. Significant changes in agonist binding were also produced by other modulatory agents such as noncompetitive blockers (GYKI 53655, SYM 2206), polycationic compounds (spermine, Naspm, philanthotoxin) and polyanionic compounds (Evans Blue, suramin, PPNDS). EC50 values usually were similar to those from physiological studies, which validates using binding tests to assess drug potencies. Moreover, direction and magnitude of the binding change (Emax) provide information about which kinetic aspects are affected by a drug. For example, the magnitude of the binding increase produced by positive modulators was strongly correlated with their ability to slow response deactivation in excised patch recordings. Binding also provides a reliable method to examine whether interactions between agents are competitive. Thus, thiocyanate did not significantly influence the EC50 of cyclothiazide, suggesting distinct sites of action. Taken together, [3H]FW binding can yield important information about drug-receptor and drug-drug interactions for a wide range of modulatory agents. One potential limitation of [3H]FW is a large preference for subunits GluR1 and GluR2 (KD 4-10 nM) over GluR3 and GluR4 (160-600 nM) which implies that tests with brain membranes preferentially reveal drug effects produced at the former two subunits. Lastly, data are shown which highlight the importance of optimizing experimental conditions in filtration assays, for instance by always including thiocyanate in wash buffers.", 
    "73": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a significant health problem, affecting approximately 1,000 to 4,000 individuals per year in Belgium. A workshop was convened by a panel of neurologists from major Belgian centers to review the latest information relating to the definition, diagnosis and treatment of convulsive SE. The panelists sought to make recommendations for practising neurologists, but also primary care physicians and physicians in intensive care units when initiating emergency measures for patients with convulsive SE. As there is an association between prolonged seizures and a poor outcome, the importance of early (within the first 5 minutes of seizure onset) and aggressive treatment is to be stressed. In addition to general systemic support (airway, circulation), intravenous administration of the benzodiazepines lorazepam or diazepam is recommended as first-line therapy. Intramuscular midazolam may also be used. If SE persists, second-line drugs include phenytoin or valproate, and third-line drugs the barbiturate phenobarbital, the benzodiazepine midazolam, or the anaesthetics thiopental or propofol, or eventually ketamine. If the patient does not recover after therapy, monitoring of seizures should involve an electroencephalogram to avoid overlooking persistence of clinically silent SE. As a general rule, the intensity of the treatment should reflect the risk to the patient from SE, and drugs likely to depress respiration and blood pressure should initially be avoided. If initial treatment with a benzodiazepine fails to control seizures, the patient must be referred to the emergency unit and a neurologist should be contacted immediately.",

    "78": "Patients with epilepsy can have impaired cognitive abilities. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in patients with epilepsy, and have been shown to induce cognitive impairments in healthy individuals. However, there are few systematic data on the effects of AEDs on specific cognitive domains. We have previously evaluated a number of AEDs with respect to their effects on working memory. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of AEDs on attention as measured by five-choice serial reaction time behavior in nonepileptic rats. The GABA-related AEDs triazolam, phenobarbital, and chlordiazepoxide significantly disrupted performance by increasing errors of omission, whereas tiagabine, valproate, and gabapentin did not. The sodium channel blocker carbamazepine increased errors of omission at relatively high doses, whereas the sodium channel blockers phenytoin, topiramate, and lamotrigine were without significant effect. Levetiracetam had no effect on attention. The disruptions produced by triazolam, phenobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, and carbamazepine were similar in magnitude to the effects of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine. The present results indicate that AEDs can disrupt attention, but there are differences among AEDs in the magnitude of the disruption in nonepileptic rats, with drugs that enhance GABA receptor function producing the most consistent disruption of attention.",

Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores > or = 20 were required for inclusion. Patients were classified at study entry as \"rapid cyclers\" if they experienced > or = 4 episodes within the last year. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze YMRS change from baseline.", 
    "81": "A significant three-way interaction (cycling frequency by medication by visit) was found when modeling change in YMRS total scores. For patients with bipolar I disorder identified as rapid cyclers, mania improvement across the trial did not differ significantly between treatment groups (p=0.181). Among non-rapid cyclers, olanzapine-treated patients had significantly greater YMRS improvement than divalproex-treated patients across the trial (p<0.001) and at most time points. Among olanzapine-treated patients, non-rapid cyclers experienced numerically greater YMRS improvement than rapid cyclers throughout the trial; statistically significant differences occurred at weeks 11, 15 and 39. In contrast, among divalproex-treated patients, YMRS scores were significantly better in rapid cyclers than non-rapid cyclers during the first two study weeks but were comparable thereafter.

    "84": "GABA(A) receptors containing alpha5 subunits have been suggested to mediate the rewarding effects of ethanol. We tested this hypothesis in mice with deletion of alpha5 subunits. alpha5 knockout mice did not differ from wildtypes in operant responding for 10% ethanol/10% sucrose, but responded less for 10% sucrose. The benzodiazepine (BZ) site inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, has higher affinity for GABA(A) receptors containing 5 subunits and dose-dependently (0-27 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced lever pressing for ethanol/sucrose in wildtype mice, but had less effect in knockout mice; lever pressing for sucrose was unaffected. These data suggest that alpha5 subunits are not essential for ethanol reward, but the reduction of operant responding for ethanol by Ro 15-4513 is mediated by alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors. In measures of ethanol consumption, alpha5 knockout mice did not differ from wildtypes at low ethanol concentrations (2-8%), but consumed less ethanol at higher concentrations; these differences were not attributable to increased behavioural disruption of the knockout by ethanol, since no differences were seen in sensitivity to ethanol's sedative or ataxic effects. Ro 15-4513's ability to reduce ethanol consumption was unaffected, suggesting that this effect is not mediated by the alpha5 subtype. Secondly, we tested the ability of a novel alpha5-efficacy-selective benzodiazepine receptor ligand, alpha5IA-II, that possesses greater inverse agonist activity at alpha5- than at alpha1-, \u00e12- or alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors, to influence operant responding. alpha5IA-II (0.03-3 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased lever pressing for 10% ethanol, the minimally effective dose of 1 mg/kg, corresponding to over 90% receptor occupancy, but did not affect lever pressing for 4% sucrose. Although inverse agonists acting at alpha5-containing receptors reduce ethanol self-administration, alpha5 subunits may not be essential to signaling ethanol reward.", 
    "85": "Autonomic cardiovascular regulation has been assessed in patients aged 4-15 years with Tourette syndrome (n = 22) and other tic disorders (n = 48). Symptom significance was estimated by a number of hyperkinetic episodes per 20 minutes, tic scale and variants of the disease course. The functional condition of autonomic nervous system was studied clinically and using spectral analysis of heart rate variability in both upright and supine positions. Negative correlation between the ratio of sympathetic and vagus influences and severity of the disease was found: the severer were tic symptoms, the stronger was a trend to vagotonia (beta = -0.36; p < 0.0025; F > 4.0). In orthostatic test, patients with Tourette syndrome demonstrated an unfavorable hypersympathicotonic type of cardiovascular system reaction. Patients were treated during 4 weeks with glycinum (0.2 +/- 0.1 mg/day), phenibutum (0.5 +/- 0.25 mg/day), clonazepam (1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/day), tiapride (200 +/- 100 mg/day), haloperidol (1-1.5 mg/day), rispolept (2 mg/day). There was no negative effect of the drugs on heart rate variability. On the contrary, the therapy reduced hyperkinetic symptoms and corrected autonomic influences on the sinus rhythm. It is suggested that changes in autonomic cardiovascular regulation might be of secondary character and do not need any special correction.", 
    "86": "To maintain horizontal eye position on a visual target after a saccade, extraocular motoneurons need a persistent (tonic) neural activity, called \"eye-position signal,\" generated by prepositus hypoglossi (PH) neurons. We have shown previously in vitro and in vivo that this neural activity depends, among others mechanisms, on the interplay of glutamatergic transmission and cholinergic synaptically triggered depolarization. Here, we used rat sagittal brainstem slices, including PH nucleus and paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). We made intracellular recordings of PH neurons and studied their synaptic activation from PPRF neurons. Train stimulation of the PPRF area evoked a cholinergic-sustained depolarization of PH neurons that outlasted the stimulus. EPSPs evoked in PH neurons by single pulses applied to the PPRF presented a short-term potentiation (STP) after train stimulation. APV (an NMDA-receptor blocker) or chelerythrine (a protein kinase-C inhibitor) had no effect on the sustained depolarization, but they did block the evoked STP, whereas pirenzepine (an M1 muscarinic antagonist) blocked both the sustained depolarization and the STP of PH neurons. Thus, electrical stimulation of the PPRF area activates both glutamatergic and cholinergic axons terminating in the PH nucleus, the latter producing a sustained depolarization probably involved in the genesis of the persistent neural activity required for eye fixation. M1-receptor activation seems to evoke a STP of PH neurons via NMDA receptors. Such STP could be needed for the stabilization of the neural network involved in the generation of position signals necessary for eye fixation after a saccade.", 
    "87": "We sought to clarify the effect of short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic on the relationship of arterial blood pressure and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco2) to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during human non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep. Nine young normal volunteers were treated in a randomized, crossover design with triazolam or placebo and underwent positron emission tomography at night. During wakefulness and stage 2 and slow wave (stages 3 and 4) sleep, we measured mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), Paco2, and absolute CBF. With triazolam compared to placebo, MAP reduced gradually. During stage 2 sleep, Paco2 increased and whole-brain mean CBF decreased. With triazolam, relative rCBF of the left orbital basal forebrain decreased more during stage 2 than slow wave sleep, whereas absolute CBF of the occipital cortex and cerebral white matter remained constant. During triazolam-induced stage 2 sleep, absolute CBF of the cerebral white matter correlated more strongly to both MAP and Paco2 than during placebo sleep and also correlated more strongly to both MAP and Paco2 than absolute CBF of the occipital cortex. In the frontal white matter, during triazolam-induced stage 2 sleep compared to wakefulness, absolute CBF was significantly better correlated to MAP, but not to Paco2. During triazolam-induced stage 2, the cerebral white matter may receive a modulated CBF regulation having the strengthened relationship of Paco2 to CBF and, more locally, the frontal white matter may depend precariously on CBF regulation.", 
    "88": "Methamphetamine is the fourth most frequently reported compound associated with drug abuse on admission of patients to treatment centres after cocaine, heroin and marijuana. It is metabolized in the organism with a reaction that is catalyzed by cytochrome P450, mainly by the CYP2D and CYP3A subfamily, 4-hydroxyamphetamine and amphetamine being dominant metabolites. The present pharmacokinetic study was undertaken to investigate the possible influence of methamphetamine (10 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for six days) on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphane as a model substrate for rat cytochrome P-4502D2 and midazolam as a model substrate for CYP3A1/2. Animals received a single injection of dextromethorphane (10 mg/kg) or midazolam (5 mg/kg) in the tail vein 24 h after the last dose of methamphetamine or administration of placebo. The results of pharmacokinetic analysis showed a significantly increased rate of dextrorphane and 3-hydroxymorphinan formation, and a marked stimulatory effect of methamphetamine on CYP2D2 metabolic activity. Similarly, the kinetics of midazolam's metabolic conversion to hydroxy derivates of midazolam indicated a significant increase in CYP3A1/2 activity. The results showed that the administration of methamphetamine significantly stimulated the metabolic activity of CYP2D2 as well as that of CYP3A1/2. With regard to the high level of homology between human and rat CYP isoforms studied, the results may have a clinical impact on future pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine abuse.",

    "101": "Acute agitation is a common psychiatric emergency often treated with intramuscular (i.m.) medication when rapid control is necessary or the patient refuses to take an oral agent. Conventional i.m. antipsychotics are associated with side effects, particularly movement disorders, that may alarm patients and render them unreceptive to taking these medications again. Ziprasidone (Geodon) is the first second-generation, or atypical, antipsychotic to become available in an i.m. formulation. Ziprasidone IM was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002 for the treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia. In October 2004, a roundtable panel of physicians with extensive experience in the management of acutely agitated patients met to review the first 2 years of experience with this agent. This monograph, a product of that meeting, discusses clinical experience to date with ziprasidone IM and offers recommendations on its use in various settings. In clinical trials, patients treated with ziprasidone IM demonstrated significant and rapid (within 15-30 minutes) reduction in agitation and improvement in psychotic symptoms, agitation, and hostility to an extent greater than or equal to that attained with haloperidol i.m. Tolerability of ziprasidone IM was superior to that of haloperidol IM, with a lower burden of movement disorders. Clinical trials have also shown that ziprasidone IM can be administered with benzodiazepines without adverse consequences. Transition from i.m. to oral ziprasidone has been well tolerated, with maintenance of symptom control. The most common adverse events associated with ziprasidone IM were insomnia, headache, and dizziness in fixed-dose trials and insomnia and hypertension in flexible-dose trials. No consistent pattern of escalating incidence of adverse events with escalating ziprasidone doses has been observed. Changes in QTc interval associated with ziprasidone at peak serum concentrations are modest and comparable to those seen with haloperidol IM. Results of randomized clinical trials of ziprasidone IM have been corroborated in studies in real-world treatment settings involving patients with extreme agitation or a recent history of alcohol or substance abuse. In these circumstances, clinically significant improvement was seen within 30 minutes of ziprasidone IM administration, without regard to the suspected underlying etiology of agitation. Agents with a good safety/tolerability profile, such as ziprasidone IM, may be more cost effective long term than older agents, due to reduced incidence of acute adverse effects (eg, acute dystonia) that often require extended periods of observation. Additional trials of ziprasidone IM in agitated patients in a variety of clinical setting are warranted to generate comparative risk/benefit data with conventional agents and other second-generation antipsychotics.", 
    "102": "Acute aortic dissection is an infrequent but important differential diagnosis of acute chest pain. The variability of presenting symptoms makes it difficult to diagnose correctly. Important clinical indicators - besides chest pain - are symptoms related to acute aortic insufficiency and/or pericardial tamponade, variable acute neurologic alterations, or signs of peripheral or visceral malperfusion. The spontaneous prognosis depends on the location and extent of the dissection, and left untreated dissection carries a high mortality. The key goal of preclinical treatment is stabilization with analgesia, mild sedation (opioids, benzodiazepines) and treatment of hypertension (beta-blockers) or hypotension (fluid administration). If the patient presents with a high probability of dissection, early transfer to a specialized center appears advisable. Initial clinical diagnostic studies include transthoracic echocardiogram and computed tomography. If the ascending aorta is involved (Stanford type A) immediate replacement of the proximal aorta is necessary. Isolated dissections of the descending aorta (type B) require aggressive blood pressure control, but can be managed conservatively in most cases. A high level of vigilance is necessary in all patients to detect and treat visceral ischemia.",

She had been diagnosed with idiopathic generalized absence epilepsy in childhood, but had experienced no seizures under lamotrigine medication since 1999. After the second EMDR session, clinical seizures in the form of absences occurred, and were validated by electroencephalography. The seizures ceased after medication with benzodiazepines and an increase in the lamotrigine level. She underwent four more sessions of EMDR treatment successfully without further seizures. Possible triggers are discussed, especially as to whether EMDR treatment played a role in reactivating epilepsy.

Data on drug use were collected in 24 Western Canadian LTC facilities (10 urban, 14 rural) for three 2-month time periods before and after the intervention. Pharmacy records were used to collect data on drug, class of drug, dose, administration, and start/stop dates. Chart reviews provided demographics, pro re nata (prn) use, and indications for drug use. Subjects comprised 2443 residents living in the 24 LTC facilities during the 1-year study. An average of 796.33 residents (32.7%) received a psychotropic drug.

Although long-term use of BZDs by seniors is a recognized problem, little is known about the mental health of the consumers. Better knowledge of their mental health would help nurses in identifying the psychological needs of this population. The goals of this longitudinal study1 (n = 138) were to describe the mental health status of long-term users of BZDs and to compare it with the mental health of seniors who have either begun or stopped consuming BZDs over a 1-year period (from Phase 1 to Phase 2). Results showed that one third of long-term users of BZDs do not present any mental health problem. Furthermore, no differences were observed between the mental health statuses of new users of BZDs, individuals who stopped using BZDs, and long-term users of BZDs. In conclusion, at least one third of long-term users of BZDs should stop using these drugs, and nurses should play a leading role in helping these seniors withdraw from BZD consumption.", 
    "110": "Recent studies have indicated that CYP3A4 exhibits non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics for numerous substrates. Both homo- and heterotropic activation have been reported, and kinetic models have suggested multiple substrates within the active site. We provide some of the first physicochemical data supporting the hypothesis of allosteric substrate binding within the CYP3A4 active site. Midazolam (MDZ) is metabolized by CYP3A4 to two hydroxylated metabolites, 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam. Incubations using purified CYP3A4 and MDZ showed that both alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha-NF) and testosterone affect the ratio of formation rates of 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam. Similar to previous reports, alpha-NF was found to promote formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, while testosterone stimulated formation of 4-hydroxymidazolam. NMR was used to measure the closest approach of individual MDZ protons to the paramagnetic heme iron of CYP3A4 using paramagnetic T(1) relaxation measurements. Solutions of 0.2 microM CYP3A4 with 500 microM MDZ resulted in calculated distances between 7.4 and 8.3 A for all monitored MDZ protons. The distances were statistically equivalent for all protons except C3-H and were consistent with the rotation within the active site or sliding parallel to the heme plane. When 50 microM alpha-NF was added, proton-heme iron distances ranged from 7.3 to 10.0 A. Consistent with kinetics of activation, the 1' position was situated closest to the heme, while the fluorophenyl 5-H proton was the furthest. Proton-heme iron distances for MDZ with CYP3A4 and 50 microM testosterone ranged from 7.7 to 9.0 A, with the flourophenyl 5-H proton furthest from the heme iron and the C4-H closest to the heme, also consistent with kinetic observations. When titrated with CYP3A4 in the presence of MDZ, testosterone and alpha-NF resonances themselves exhibited significant broadening and enhanced relaxation rates, indicating that these effector molecules were also bound within the CYP3A4 active site near the paramagnetic heme iron. These results suggest that the effector exerts its cooperative effects on MDZ metabolism through simultaneous binding of MDZ and effector near the CYP3A4 heme.",

The first 2 weeks were used for dose titration. Subsequently, the patients received a fixed dose of either olanzapine (average dose 4.71 mg) or haloperidol (average dose 1.75 mg) from day 14 to day 35. Both olanzapine and haloperidol decreased agitation significantly (decrease in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores), but there was no significant difference between the two drugs. The two drugs had comparable effects on all secondary outcome measures. They were well tolerated and had a similar side-effect pattern. Our study could not demonstrate the superiority of olanzapine, compared to haloperidol, for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia.",

    "113": "Assessing pain in critically ill patients, particularly in nonverbal patients, is a great challenge. In this study, we validated a behavioral pain scale (BPS) in critically ill, sedated, and mechanically ventilated patients. The BPS score was the sum of 3 subscales that have a range score of 1-4: facial expression, upper limb movements, and compliance with mechanical ventilation. Two assessors observed and scored pain simultaneously with the BPS at rest and during painful procedures. The psychometric properties of the BPS that were studied were reliability, validity, and responsiveness. We achieved 360 observations in 30 patients. The BPS was internally reliable (Cronbach alpha = 0.72). The intraclass correlation coefficient to evaluate inter-rater reliability was high (0.95). Validity was demonstrated by the change in BPS scores, which were significantly higher during painful procedures, with averages of 3.9 +/- 1.1 at rest and 6.8 +/- 1.9 during procedures (P < 0.001), and by the principal components factor analysis, which revealed a large first-factor accounting for 65% of the variance in pain expression. The BPS exhibited excellent responsiveness, with an effect size ranging from 2.2 to 3.4. This study demonstrated that the BPS can be valid and reliable for measuring pain in noncommunicative intensive care unit patients.",

As older women who have medical problems have the highest rates of chronic insomnia, physicians must have a high index of suspicion and be prepared to explore various etiologic factors that might be operative. Treatment should focus on setting specific goals, with patients using strategies that combine lifestyle changes, behavioral interventions, and appropriate medications. OTC agents, sedating antidepressants at low dosages (trazodone, doxepin, amitriptyline, and others), and nonhypnotic benzodiazepines are insufficiently studied to provide evidence-based support for their use to treat chronic insomnia. Particularly in the elderly, close monitoring is needed to prevent falls, accidents, and cognitive impairment from these agents. FDA-labeled hypnotic agents are efficacious, but long-term studies have not been available until the recent release of eszopiclone in the United States. Recent work encourages the use of CBT even in patients who have used sleeping pills for several years, although the success of CBT has been less encouraging when applied to chronic insomnia sufferers who have concurrent psychiatric disorders and who have taken hypnotics for years.",

The enantioselective assay allowed to separate the enantiomers and to verify the stereochemical instability of lorazepam. The linearity assessed for lorazepam unchanged was 0.2-20 ng of each enantiomer/ml plasma and 0.2-15 ng of each enantiomer/ml urine. The linearity assessed for total lorazepam (after enzymatic hydrolysis) was 1-30 ng of each enantiomer/ml plasma and 10-150 ng of each enantiomer/ml urine. The coefficients of variation obtained for the intra- and interassay precision were less than 15%. The method was applied to the investigation of the kinetic disposition and metabolism of racemic lorazepam administered as a single oral dose of 2 mg to a parturient. The occurrence of racemization required the calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters as enantiomeric mixtures of lorazepam (t(1/2a) 3.5h; K(a) 0.198 ngh(-1); t(1/2) 11.5h; beta 0.060 h(-1); AUC(0-infinity) 192.1ngh/ml; CLt/f 2.41ml/minkg; Vd/f 173.5l; Fel 0.41%, and Cl(R) 0.0099 ml/minkg) and its metabolite lorazepam-glucuronide (t(1/2f) 1.2h; K(f) 0.578 h(-1); t(1/2) 16.6h; beta 0.042 h(-1); AUC(0-infinity) 207.6 ngh/ml; Fel 51.80%, and Cl(R) 98.32 ml/minkg).

    "121": "Cyamemazine is an anxiolytic antipsychotic, which reduces ethanol withdrawal symptoms. Here, we investigated if cyamemazine can be also effective as substitute drug to facilitate benzodiazepine withdrawal. A total of 168 patients treated with benzodiazepines for at least 3 months and with a <18 score in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) were included in the study. Previous benzodiazepine treatment was withdrawn, and patients were randomized to a 4-week treatment with cyamemazine (25-50 mg q.d.) or bromazepam (3-6 mg q.d.), followed by 2 weeks of placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the maximal anxiety rebound as measured with the HARS during the 42 days of treatment. No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found for the extent or incidence of rebound anxiety. Considering all dropout patients as withdrawal failures, after 6 months of follow-up, 56/84 patients in the cyamemazine group (66.7%) and 55/84 patients in the bromazepam group (65.5%) were successfully withdrawn. 28 patients in the cyamemazine group and 18 in the bromazepam group had an adverse event, including anxiety, insomnia, dry mouth and somnolence. No extra-pyramidal symptoms were reported. In conclusion, cyamemazine was comparable to bromazepam in ensuring successful benzodiazepine withdrawal and in controlling the acute benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Cyamemazine may be useful to facilitate benzodiazepine withdrawal in those patients where bromazepam substitution is not appropriate.",

    "127": "AMPA-type glutamate receptors are specifically inhibited by the noncompetitive antagonists GYKI-53655 and CP-465,022, which act through sites and mechanisms that are not understood. Using receptor mutagenesis, we found that these antagonists bind at the interface between the S1 and S2 glutamate binding core and channel transmembrane domains, specifically interacting with S1-M1 and S2-M4 linkers, thereby disrupting the transduction of agonist binding into channel opening. We also found that the antagonists' affinity is higher for agonist-unbound receptors than for activated nondesensitized receptors, further depending on the level of S1 and S2 domain closure. These results provide evidence for substantial conformational changes in the S1-M1 and S2-M4 linkers following agonist binding and channel opening, offering a conceptual frame to account for noncompetitive antagonism of AMPA receptors.",

We found crude and age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rates of SE of 16.5/100 000 and 11.6/100 000, respectively. In patients under 60 years crude incidence was 2.9/100 000 and in the elderly (>/=60 years) 38.6/100 000. Acute symptomatic SE accounted for 30% and a cerebrovascular pathology was the most frequently associated etiologic condition (60%). A history of seizures was reported in 41% of patients. The first therapeutic intervention was mainly benzodiazepines (lorazepam 46%; diazepam 33%). The 30-day case fatality was 7%. We observed that the adult population of an area with a low level of urbanization has the same risk for SE, clinical features and short-term prognosis as European urban areas. The only contrasting result is the 30-day case fatality of 7% against the 39% found in the other Italian study (Bologna), despite the similarity of the SE features in these two areas of the same region. We infer that the short-term prognosis of SE could also be considerably influenced by differences in health service organization (and hence management) possibly due to different levels of urbanization.",

Exposure information was ascertained in early pregnancy, and comparisons after adjustment for some confounders were made with all infants born. In order to validate some findings, data from the Central-East France Registry were studied for first trimester drug exposure in 235 infants, and use of ovarian stimulation in 315 infants with craniostenosis.",

    "137": "The acute use of alcohol and several other licit and illicit drugs can affect mental state and cognitive function. The chronic use of certain drugs may also increase the risk of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life. This paper focuses on the long-term cognitive consequences of using alcohol, benzodiazepines, tobacco and cannabis. Currently available evidence indicates that mild to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and may in fact have a protective effect against dementia, although heavy, long-term consumption is likely to have a negative impact on cognitive function. The degree that alcohol-related cognitive impairment must reach to be classified as dementia is currently obscure. Longer-term smoking is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and possibly dementia. The chronic use of benzodiazepines has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment but information relating to dementia remains inconclusive. The chronic use of cannabis may impair intellectual abilities but data on this topic remain sparse and difficult to interpret. In conclusion, there is evidence that some drugs contribute to the causal pathway that leads to the development of cognitive impairment but currently available data do not support the introduction of a separate diagnostic category of drug-induced dementia (such as alcohol-related dementia). Health promotion programs designed to decrease tobacco smoking and \"harmful\" alcohol use (and possibly other drug use) may decrease the burden of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life.",

In the other eight patients (olanzapine-first group), after shift to risperidone, there was a decrease in triglyceride level (p=0.009), body weight (p=0.049) and body mass index (BMI; p=0.04). When comparing the metabolic profiles in all patients after olanzapine and after risperidone (irrespective of the order of treatment), the mean triglyceride level (p=0.001), body weight (p=0.001) and BMI (p=0.015) were significantly higher in patients receiving olanzapine than in those receiving risperidone. Furthermore, there was a small increase in total cholesterol level (p=0.091) and a small decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level (p=0.061) in olanzapine group, but the differences did not reach a significant level. There was no significant difference between olanzapine and risperidone in fasting glucose and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).",

Fever, cough, otitis, and sinusitis preceded neuropsychiatric symptoms. Antistreptolysin O and DNAse B antibody titers were elevated, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral diffuse caudate nuclei swelling. Plasmapheresis resulted in significant and rapid clinical improvement of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms and a simultaneous decrease in basal ganglia swelling, consistent with an immune-mediated pathophysiological process involving group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention improved with lorazepam, suggesting that the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms could be manifestations of catatonia.",

There have been few reports about other treatment options for PLC. Here, the authors report rapid responses to mirtazapine in two patients with poststroke PLC who failed to respond to SSRIs or bupropion. In the first case, a 63-year-old woman with severe long-standing crying spells that had persisted for 3 months responded well to low-dose mirtazapine within a few days; she could not tolerate citalopram or sertraline. In the second case, both the laughing and crying spells of a 64-year-old woman were improved within a few days of mirtazapine administration, after they had not responded to bupropion. This is one of the first reports to suggest that mirtazapine may be an alternative to SSRIs for treating poststroke PLC.", 
    "145": "Nine healthy volunteers participated in a 3-phase clinical pharmacokinetic study of the benzodiazepine derivative clonazepam. During phases I and II, subjects received the conventional oral dosage form of clonazepam, 0.5 mg 3 times daily, for 7 days. Multiple plasma samples were drawn on day 1 and day 7 of the trial and once daily during the washout period after the final dose. Based on nonlinear regression, mean kinetic variables for clonazepam were: absorption half-life, 24 minutes; elimination half-life, 40 hours; apparent oral clearance, 72 mL/min. The extent of accumulation at steady state relative to the first day of treatment averaged 3.3-fold, and was consistent with values predicted based on the elimination half-life. This finding suggests that once-daily dosage with clonazepam would be appropriate for many patients. In phase III of the study, subjects received a single 2.7 mg subcutaneous injection of a microsphere formulation of clonazepam, designed to produce a sustained-release profile. The maximum average plasma clonazepam concentration was 3.0 ng/mL, reached at 72 hours after dosage. Thereafter, plasma concentrations fell slowly over the 13-day sampling period, remaining above 1 ng/mL for 12 days. Overall systemic availability of clonazepam from the microsphere injection, relative to the conventional oral dosage form, was 1.05. Thus, the microsphere preparation of injectable clonazepam provides complete absorption from the injection site, with the intended slow-release pharmacokinetic profile.", 
    "146": "Activation of a neural brain-testicular pathway by the intracerebroventricular injection of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO), the hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), or alcohol (EtOH) rapidly decreases the testosterone (T) response to human chorionic gonadotropin. To elucidate the intratesticular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we investigated the influence of intracerebroventricular-injected ISO, CRF, or EtOH on levels of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), and the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme in semipurified Leydig cells. ISO (10 microg), CRF (5 microg), or EtOH (5 microl of 200 proof, a dose that does not induce neuronal damage nor leaks to the periphery) rapidly decreased StAR and PBR but not cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme protein levels. Levels of the variant of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that is restricted to Leydig cells, TnNOS, significantly increased in response to ISO, CRF, and EtOH over the time course of altered StAR/PBR concentrations. However, pretreatment of the rats with N(w)nitro-arginine methylester, which blocked ISO-induced increases in TnNOS, neither restored the T response to human chorionic gonadotropin nor prevented the decreases in StAR and PBR. These results provide evidence of concomitant changes in Leydig cell StAR and PBR levels in live rats. They also indicate that activation of a neural brain-testicular pathway rapidly decreases concentrations of these steroidogenic proteins while up-regulating testicular NO production. However, additional studies are necessary to elucidate the functional role played by this gas in our model.", 
    "147": "Long chain triglyceride (>C12) in the intestinal lumen potently inhibits gastric emptying and acid secretion via the vagal afferent pathway. While the mechanism of inhibition involves the formation of chylomicrons, the essential role of the apolipoprotein apo A-IV is unclear. Using apo A-IV(-/-) mice, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of gastric emptying and gastric acid secretion in response to dietary lipid is dependent upon apo A-IV. As measured by nuclear scintigraphy in awake mice, gastric emptying of an ingested whole-egg meal was significantly faster in apo A-IV(-/-) knockout versus A-IV(+/+) controls (34 +/- 1 versus 54 +/- 3 min, P < 0.0001). In anaesthetized A-IV(+/+) mice, meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion was 59% inhibited by intestinal lipid infusion; this was abolished in apo A-IV(-/-) mice. Oral gavage of lipid in awake mice activated neurones throughout the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in A-IV(+/+) mice, measured by immunohistochemical localization of Fos protein expression. However, in the mid region of the NTS (bregma -7.32 to -7.76 mm), Fos expression in response to intestinal lipid was significantly decreased by 50% in apo A-IV(-/-) mice compared to A-IV(+/+) controls. We conclude that activation of the vagal afferent pathway and inhibition of gastric function in response to dietary lipid is partly dependent upon apo A-IV.",

    "152": "We present the efficacy and safety of the use of remifentanil for intubation, sedation and analgesia in a preterm infant during mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome. A 34-week-old baby, born by cesarean delivery that developed respiratory distress, required intubation and ventilatory support. For intubation, the baby was given midazolam (0.2 mg.kg(-1)) and remifentanil (1 microg.kg(-1)). The intubation conditions were assessed and classified as excellent. The remifentanil infusion was started at dose 0.75 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) and the dose adjustments were made depending on the neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS), hemodynamic and respiratory changes or the presence of spontaneous movements. Pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, ECG and invasive blood pressure were continuously monitored. He was given surfactant within 2.5 h of life after which ventilator parameters could be progressively decreased. Three hours later, the remifentanil infusion was decreased to 0.5 microg.kg(-1).min(-1), and he remained sedated (NIPS < 2). Six hour after surfactant administration, blood gases and chest X ray were normal. The remifentanil infusion was then discontinued and 30 min later the baby was awake and extubated with success. There were no side effects after intubation or during the continuous infusion. The profile of remifentanil allowing a rapid recovery, the absence of side effects and a good level of sedation and analgesia support the choice of this opioid for sedation in the NICU.",

    "155": "The evidence base informing terminal care is largely descriptive, retrospective, or extrapolated. While home deaths and hospice use are increasing, medical care near death is becoming more aggressive and hospice lengths of stay remain short. Though the prediction of impending death remains imprecise, studies have identified several common terminal signs and symptoms. Decreased communication near death complicates the determination of patient wishes, and advanced directives prior to the terminal stage are recommended. Anorexia and cachexia are common in dying patients but there is no evidence that this process is painful or responsive to intervention. While there is general consensus that artificial nutrition is not beneficial in dying patients, the use of artificial hydration is controversial, especially in the setting of delirium. Breathlessness has been shown to benefit from oral and parenteral opioids but not anxiolytics. Accumulation of respiratory tract secretions (death rattle) is common and usually responds to antimuscarinics. Physical pain typically decreases toward death but its assessment in dying patients is difficult. Terminal delirium may occur in up to one-third of patients, may have a reversible cause, and may respond to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines. Palliative sedation is controversial but widely used, especially internationally. Caregiver stress and bereavement may benefit from improved communication and hospice involvement.",

Individuals who are infected with HIV and hepatitis C, who are polysubstance users, and who are benzodiazepine dependent present with inordinate demands for prescribed substances to use or to sell in the street. The trainee needs to become comfortable with both limit-setting and harm reduction in order to keep the patient engaged in both lifesaving medical and psychiatric care. Nurturing and supportive supervision enables the trainee to integrate skills and work toward an understanding of countertransferences.

Antipsychotic medication costs were significantly lower for individuals prescribed risperidone than olanzapine (1763 dollars versus 2582 dollars; p<0.001). Individuals prescribed risperidone had lower (but not significant) expenditures for mental health services (4714 dollars versus 5077 dollars; p=0.792), as well as total mental health care costs (7407 dollars versus 9011 dollars; p=0.255).",

The present study tested the hypothesis that olanzapine may be differentially effective at reducing cue-elicited craving and differentially effective as a treatment for alcohol dependence over the course of a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial among individuals with and without the seven-repeat allele. Participants who met DSM IV criteria for alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (5 mg) or a placebo over the course of the trial. After 2 weeks of treatment, participants completed a cue reactivity assessment. The results suggested that participants who were homozygous or heterozygous for the seven (or longer)-repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR responded to olanzapine with reductions in cue-elicited craving as well as reductions in alcohol consumption over the course of the 12-week trial, whereas individuals with the shorter alleles did not respond favorably to olanzapine.", 
    "161": "We examined learning and expression of contextual implicit learning of a sequence of targets in a speeded target-detection task in amnesic and control participants. Amnesia was of organic origin in one participant group and induced psychopharmacologically (diazepam 7.5 or 15 mg) in another. Although the amnesic groups were able to learn the target sequence normally, their expression of sequence knowledge (priming) was attenuated when contextual support was limited. This was evaluated by studying response latencies for targets primed by between 0 and 5 preceding context locations. Whereas control participants showed priming when the current target location was primed by only two previous locations, priming was eliminated with two (but not four) previous locations by a low dose of diazepam and was eliminated even with four elements of context under a high dose of diazepam and in amnesia of organic origin. The results suggest that a function of the hippocampal memory system is to support contextual learning and performance, even when that learning is nondeclarative.",
