It has been found that among the various human factors, alcohol consumption, using drugs and subsequent driving on the roads are major risk factors. Traffic regulations in India penalises drivers who drive beyond permissible alcohol limit of 30 mg%. Consumption of psychoactive drugs such as opioid, cannabis and benzodiazepines has been reported mainly among youngsters. Hardly any data is available in Indian context particularly from North-West Zone of India.",

    "2": "Consenting injured drivers who presented to the trauma centre in Chandigarh from September 2013 to January 2014 were included. Urine samples collected from the subjects were screened for abusive drug exposure (opioid, cannabis and benzodiazepines) and alcohol using commercial bedside urine immunoassay kits. In urine alcohol positive cases blood samples were collected and analysed for alcohol concentration using standard gas chromatography. Retrograde extrapolation method was used to assess BAC at the time of accident.", 
    "3": "A total of 200 injured drivers were included in this study. We found substance consumption in 54.5% of drivers and alcohol (40.5%) was the most prevalent substance consumed followed by opiates (13%), cannabis (7%) and benzodiazepines (7%). More than one substance was shown in urine of 11.5% of drivers. Among 81 alcohol positive screening cases, the quantitative analysis was successfully done for 76 cases. Except one, all cases showed BAC value more than 30 mg% which is the legal limit for driving any vehicle in India. The values of alcohol concentration in blood at the time of accident were in the range of 20 to 391 mg%.", 
    "4": "This study has shown that drivers are consuming not only alcohol but other psychoactive drugs also. Indian traffic regulatory authorities are penalising drunk drivers by doing road side breath alcohol testing with no protocols for drug screening. Appropriate measures should be adopted to screen traffic offenders for psychoactive drugs also.", 
    "5": "The use of multi drug regimens among the elderly population has increased tremendously over the last decade although the benefits of medications are always accompanied by potential harm, even when prescribed at recommended doses. The elderly populations are particularly at an increased risk of adverse drug reactions considering comorbidity, poly-therapy, physiological changes affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs and, in some cases, poor compliance due to cognitive impairment and/or depression. In this setting, drug-drug interaction may represent a serious and even life-threatening clinical condition. Moreover, the inability to distinguish drug-induced symptoms from a definitive medical diagnosis often results in addition of yet another drug to treat the symptoms, which in turn increases drug-drug interactions. Cognitive enhancers, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, are the most widely prescribed agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, including psychotic symptoms and behavioral disorders, represent noncognitive disturbances frequently observed in AD patients. Antipsychotic drugs are at high risk of adverse events, even at modest doses, and may interfere with the progression of cognitive impairment and interact with several drugs including anti-arrhythmics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Other medications often used in AD patients are represented by anxiolytic, like benzodiazepine, or antidepressant agents. These agents also might interfere with other concomitant drugs through both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. In this review we focus on the most frequent drug-drug interactions, potentially harmful, in AD patients with behavioral symptoms considering both physiological and pathological changes in AD patients, and potential pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic drug interaction mechanisms.", 
    "6": "A 62-year-old man presented with left middle cerebral artery stroke. 1\u2005h postadministration of tissue plasminogen activator, he received a total of 4\u2005mg of haloperidol for combativeness. He developed partial complex status epilepticus, requiring benzodiazepines, phenytoin, propofol and intubation. 5\u2005h later, he developed recurrent stereotyped tonic movements involving arching of the back, extension of the arms and contraction of opposing muscle groups. Repeat CT scan of the head showed evolving insular infarct. Differential diagnoses for these movements included tonic/clonic seizures, extensor (decerebrate) posturing from haemorrhagic conversion, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or dystonic reaction. Given the lack of response to antiseizure medications, the recent administration of haloperidol, and the prompt resolution of movements following diphenhydramine administration, an acute dystonic reaction was considered. This atypical case of a critically ill patient with stroke highlights the fact that these patients may have multiple abnormal movements requiring careful analysis to guide diagnosis-specific management.", 
    "7": "The clinical use of benzodiazepines is limited by the development of tolerance to their pharmacological effects. Tolerance to each of the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines develops at different rates. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism of tolerance by performing behavioral tests in combination with biochemical studies. To this end, we administered prolonged treatments of diazepam to rats for 7 or 14 days. Tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam was detected by means of the open field test after the 7- and 14-day treatments, whereas tolerance to the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepine manifested following only the 14-day treatment in the elevated plus maze. The cerebral cortical concentrations of diazepam did not decline after the diazepam treatments, indicating that tolerance was not due to alterations in pharmacokinetic factors. The uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine site interactions and an increase in the degree of phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor \u03b32 subunit at serine 327 in the cerebral cortex were produced by day 7 of diazepam treatment and persisted after 14 days of exposure to benzodiazepine. Thus, these alterations could be part of the mechanism of tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam. An increase in the percentage of \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors in the cerebral cortex was observed following the 14-day treatment with diazepam but not the 7-day treatment, suggesting that tolerance to the anxiolytic effects is associated with a change in receptor subunit composition. The understanding of the molecular bases of tolerance could be important for the development of new drugs that maintain their efficacies over long-term treatments.", 
    "8": "A hallmark in the neuropathology of temporal lobe epilepsy is brain inflammation which has been suggested as both a biomarker and a new mechanistic target for treatments. The translocator protein (TSPO), due to its high upregulation under neuroinflammatory conditions and the availability of selective PET tracers, is a candidate target. An important step to exploit this target is a thorough characterisation of the spatiotemporal profile of TSPO during epileptogenesis.", 
    "9": "TSPO expression, microglial activation, astrocyte reactivity and cell loss in several brain regions were evaluated at five time points during epileptogenesis, including the chronic epilepsy phase in the kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (KASE) model (n = 52) and control Wistar Han rats (n = 33). Seizure burden was also determined in the chronic phase. Furthermore, \u00b9\u2078F-PBR111 PET/MRI scans were acquired longitudinally in an additional four KASE animals.", 
    "10": "TSPO expression measured with in vitro and in vivo techniques was significantly increased at each time point and peaked two weeks post-SE in the limbic system. A prominent association between TSPO expression and activated microglia (p < 0.001; r = 0.7), as well as cell loss (p < 0.001; r = -0.8) could be demonstrated. There was a significant positive correlation between spontaneous seizures and TSPO upregulation in several brain regions with increased TSPO expression.", 
    "11": "TSPO expression was dynamically upregulated during epileptogenesis, persisted in the chronic phase and correlated with microglia activation rather than reactive astrocytes. TSPO expression was correlating with spontaneous seizures and its high expression during the latent phase might possibly suggest being an important switching point in disease ontogenesis which could be further investigated by PET imaging.", 
    "12": "The etiology of schizophrenia is poorly understood and two principle hypotheses have dominated the field. Firstly, that subcortical dopamine function is enhanced while cortical dopamine function is reduced and secondly, that cortical glutamate systems are dysfunctional. It is also widely accepted that currently used antipsychotics have essentially no impact on cognitive deficits and persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Reduced dopamine transmission via dopamine D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex has been hypothesized to be involved in the aetiology of these symptom domains and enhancing cortical dopamine transmission within an optimal window has been suggested to be potentially beneficial. In these pre-clinical studies we have determined that combined administration of the d-amphetamine pro-drug, lisdexamfetamine and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine increased dopamine efflux in the rat prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens to an extent greater than either drug given separately without affecting olanzapine's ability to block striatal dopamine D2 receptors which is important for its antipsychotic activity. Furthermore, in an established rodent model used to compare the subjective effects of novel compounds the ability of lisdexamfetamine to generalize to a d-amphetamine cue was dose-dependently attenuated when co-administered with olanzapine suggesting that lisdexamfetamine may produce less marked subjective effects when administered adjunctively with olanzapine.",

Multiple doses of physostigmine successfully treated it. Benztropine is a potent antimuscarinic agent, whereas risperidone has not been reported to cause antimuscarinic toxicity. The use of physostigmine to treat benztropine intoxication in a pediatric patient has not previously been described. In this case, multiple doses were used and were well tolerated.", 
    "14": "Increased awareness of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) has led to higher use of antipsychotic medications for treatment of delirium.

    "31": "Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is a life-threatening condition characterized by hyperadrenergic activity and autonomic dysfunction. Also termed autonomic storms, PSH can occur after a variety of cerebral insults, most commonly traumatic brain injury. Limited pediatric literature is available, especially in patients with brain injury from hypoxia. No consensus exists for the terminology, diagnostic criteria, or treatment algorithm for PSH. Thus, the optimal management, including medication selection and dosing, remains unclear. We present the detailed treatment of a 9-year-old, African American male with hypoxic brain injury after pulseless arrest following status asthmaticus, who subsequently developed PSH. The patient began to experience episodes of tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, diaphoresis, rigidity, and dystonic posturing on hospital day 5. After ruling out other potential causes, a diagnosis of PSH was made. Episodes of PSH failed to respond to lorazepam or labetalol but were aborted successfully with morphine. Management of PSH after hypoxic brain injury required medications for acute treatment as well as for prevention of PSH. Morphine was found to be highly effective and safe for aborting the autonomic crises. Other agents more commonly described in the literature did not result in an adequate response and were associated with significant adverse effects. A combination of clonazepam, baclofen, and either propranolol or clonidine aided in reducing the frequency of episodes of PSH. We suggest using morphine for aborting severe episodes of PSH that do not respond to antihypertensive agents or benzodiazepines.",

FPSE utilizes a flexible fabric surface as the substrate platform for creating sol-gel hybrid organic-inorganic sorbent coatings. FPSE media can be introduced directly into the sample containing the target analyte(s), requiring no need for prior sample pretreatment or clean-up. Benzodiazepines were selected as model analytes because they represent one of the most widely used therapeutic drugs in psychiatry and are also amongst the most frequently encountered drugs in forensic toxicology. The chromatographic separation of target analytes was performed on a LiChroCART-LiChrospher\u00ae100 RP-18e (5 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 4 mm) analytical column, operated at room temperature. Ternary gradient elution was applied with a mobile phase that consisted of acetonitrile, methanol and ammonium acetate (0.05 M), which was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Diode array detection was performed with monitoring at 240 nm. FPSE was performed using cellulose fabric extraction media coated with sol-gel poly(ethylene glycol) (sol-gel PEG). Absolute recovery values in the equilibrium state for the examined benzodiazepines were found to be 27% for bromazepam, 63% for lorazepam, 42 % for diazepam and 39% for alprazolam.

Samples are collected by clipping of 2-3 mm of nail from all fingers (100 mg). We present drug testing results from 10,349 nail samples collected from high-risk cases during a 3-year period of time. Samples were analyzed by validated analytical methods. The initial testing was performed mostly using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) as well. Presumptive positive samples were subjected to confirmatory testing with sample preparation procedures including washing, pulverizing, digestion and extraction optimized for each drug class. The total of 7,799 samples was analyzed for amphetamines. The concentrations ranged from 40 to 572,865 pg/mg (median, 100-3,687) for all amphetamine analytes. Amphetamine and methamphetamine were present in 14% of the samples, 22 samples were positive for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (0.3%), 7 for methylenedioxyamphetamine (0.09%) and 4 for 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (0.05%). Cocaine and related analytes were found in 5% samples (7,787 total), and the concentration range was 20-265,063 pg/mg (median 84-1,768). Opioids overall ranged from 40 to 118,229 pg/mg (median 123-830). The most prevalent opioid was oxycodone (15.1%) and hydrocodone (11.4%) compared with 1.0-3.6% for the others, including morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine and oxymorphone. Carboxy-\u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol positivity rate was 18.1% (0.04-262 pg/mg, median 6.41). Out of 3,039 samples, 756 were positive (24.9%) for ethyl glucuronide (20-3,754 pg/mg, median 88). Other drugs found in nails included barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, meperidine, tramadol, zolpidem, propoxyphene, naltrexone and buprenorphine. Nail analyses have become a reliable way of determining the long-term use and abuse of drugs. Extraction techniques are simple and produce accurate and precise results. Sensitive analytical instrumentation, mainly LC-MS-MS, allows for detection of femtogram (10(-15) g) quantities of substances in nails. Samples were from a high-risk population, therefore the extraordinary positivity rate was observed.", 
    "34": "Several antipsychotics have well-known adverse metabolic effects. Studies uncovering molecular mechanisms of such drugs in patients are challenging due to high dropout rates, previous use of antipsychotics and restricted availability of biological samples. Rat experiments, where previously unexposed animals are treated with antipsychotics, allow for direct comparison of different drugs, but have been hampered by the short half-life of antipsychotics in rodents. The use of long-acting formulations of antipsychotics could significantly increase the value of rodent models in the molecular characterization of therapeutic and adverse effects of these agents. However, as long-acting formulations have rarely been used in rodents, there is a need to characterize the basic metabolic phenotype of different antipsychotics. Using long-acting olanzapine injections as a positive control, the metabolic effects of intramuscular long-acting risperidone in female rats were investigated for the first time. Like olanzapine, risperidone induced rapid, significant hyperphagia and weight gain, with concomitant increase in several plasma lipid species. Both drugs also induced weight-independent upregulation of several genes encoding enzymes involved in lipogenesis, but this activation was not confirmed at the protein level. Our findings shed light on the role of drug administration, drug dose and nutritional status in the development of rodent models for adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic agents.", 
    "35": "Inability to predict the therapeutic effect of a drug in individual pain patients prolongs the process of drug and dose finding until satisfactory pharmacotherapy can be achieved. Many chronic pain conditions are associated with hypersensitivity of the nervous system or impaired endogenous pain modulation. Pharmacotherapy often aims at influencing these disturbed nociceptive processes. Its effect might therefore depend on the extent to which they are altered. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) can evaluate various aspects of pain processing and might therefore be able to predict the analgesic efficacy of a given drug. In the present study three drugs commonly used in the pharmacological management of chronic low back pain are investigated. The primary objective is to examine the ability of QST to predict pain reduction. As a secondary objective, the analgesic effects of these drugs and their effect on QST are evaluated.",

QST is assessed at baseline, 1 and 2 h after drug administration. Pain intensity, side effects and patients' global impression of change are assessed in intervals of 30 min up to two hours after drug intake. Baseline QST is used as explanatory variable to predict drug effect. The change in QST over time is analyzed to describe the pharmacodynamic effects of each drug on experimental pain modalities. Genetic polymorphisms are analyzed as co-variables.",

We recruited 1065 participants who ages 20 years or older and newly diagnosed with epilepsy (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 345) between 2004 and 2011 and assigned them to the epilepsy group. We subsequently frequency-matched them with participants in a control group (n\u200a=\u200a4260) according to sex, age, and index year at a 1:4 ratio. A logistic regression model was employed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for association of epilepsy with BZD exposure. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to estimate the dose-response relationship between BZD levels and epilepsy risk. The adjusted OR (aOR) for the association of epilepsy with BZD exposure was 2.02 (95% confidence interval [CI]\u200a=\u200a1.68-2.42). The aOR for an average BZD dose increased to 1.26 for the participants on <0.01 defined daily dose (DDD), and increased to 4.32 for those on \u22651.50 DDD. On average, when the DDD of BZD exposure increased by 100 units, the epilepsy risk increase by 1.03-fold (95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.01-1.04, P\u200a=\u200a0.003). The annual BZD exposure day ranges were significantly associated with epilepsy (2-7 days: aOR\u200a=\u200a1.67; 8-35 days: aOR\u200a=\u200a3.16; and \u226535 days: aOR\u200a=\u200a5.60). Whenever the annual BZD exposure increased by 30 days, the risk of epilepsy notably increased by 1.03-fold (95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.01-1.04, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). In addition, users who quit BZD for more than 6 months still exhibited a higher risk of epilepsy than did the non-BZD users. A considerable increase in epilepsy occurrence was observed in ones with BZD use, particularly in those with prolonged use, multiple exposure, and high-dose consumption.",

    "44": "Ethylphenidate is a psychostimulant and analogue of methylphenidate. Interestingly it is also produced as a metabolite from the co-ingestion of methylphenidate and alcohol (ethanol). In the UK, between April and June 2015, ethylphenidate and 6 other methylphenidate based novel psychoactive substances (NPS) were subjected to a temporary class drug order under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Ethylphenidate is being abused by both novel and habitual drug users, more prominently in the East of Scotland. What is unknown in the literature is the contribution of ethylphenidate in deaths. A search was conducted for an 18 month period (July 2013 to December 2014) to identify cases where ethylphenidate was detected during post-mortem toxicological analysis. Nineteen cases were identified and these cases were examined with regards to case circumstances, pathology findings, toxicology results and adverse effects. The individuals ranged in age from 20 to 54 (median 37) and the majority were male (n=14) and from the East of Scotland (n=16), more specifically Edinburgh and surrounding area. Current or previous heroin abuse was a common theme in these cases (n=16) and injection was a common route of administration of \"legal highs\" or \"burst\". The concentration of ethylphenidate in the cases ranged from 0.008 mg/L to over 2 mg/L in post-mortem femoral blood (median 0.25 mg/L, average 0.39 mg/L). Other drugs commonly detected were benzodiazepines (n=15), followed by opiates (n=11, 4 of which were positive for 6-monoacetylmorphine) and then methadone (n=8). All 19 cases received a full post-mortem examination and there were 10 cases where drug toxicity was the sole or potentially contributory factor to the cause of death. Ethylphenidate was specifically mentioned in the cause of death for 5 cases, chronic intravenous (IV) drug use was named as part of the cause of death for 2 cases and in 6 cases there was evidence of complications and infections through IV drug use. As far as it is known to the authors, this is the first review of post-mortem cases involving the use of ethylphenidate in East and West Scotland. This study can be used as a guide for toxicologists and pathologists when interpreting cases which are positive for ethylphenidate.",

Treatment participants received a tailored BI, while control participants only completed the study questionnaires. At the 3-month follow-up, each participant's past 3-month drug use and misuse and treatment utilization were compared to his or her baseline enrollment data.

The most commonly misused drugs were marijuana, prescription opioids, cocaine/crack, and benzodiazepines. Although at follow-up the proportions of participants reporting any past 3-month drug misuse had decreased in both study arms (control 84% vs. treatment 78%), the decreases were similar between the two study arms (\u0394-6.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -13.0% to 0.0). In addition, at follow-up there were no differences between study arms in those who were currently receiving drug treatment (\u03941.8; 95% CI = -3.5 to 6.8), who had received treatment during the past 3 months (\u0394-2.0; 95% CI = -6.5 to 2.4), or who at least contacted a treatment program (\u0394 1.7; 95% CI = -2.4 to 6.1).

    "50": "Use of 'party drugs', a particular set of recreational drugs used in the context of 'ChemSex', is frequent among MSM living with HIV. A recently published observational study showed that more than half of HIV-infected MSM interviewed reported use of illicit substances in the previous 3 months, with frequent concomitant use of three or more drugs. These substances are a combination of 'club drugs' (methylenedioxymethamphetamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, ketamine, benzodiazepine) and drugs that are more specifically used in a sexualized context (methamphetamine, mephedrone, poppers and erectile dysfunction agents). Although formal data on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between recreational drugs and antiretroviral agents are lacking, information regarding potentially toxic interactions can be theorized or sometimes conclusions may be drawn from case studies and cohort observational studies. However, the risk of coadministering party drugs and antiretrovirals should not be overestimated. The major risk for a drug-drug interaction is when using ritonavir-boosting or cobicistat-boosting agents, and maybe some nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Knowledge of the metabolic pathways of 'party drugs' may help in advising patients on which illicit substances have a high potential for drug-drug interactions, as this is not the case for all.",

We describe a case of clonidine withdrawal causing life-threatening hypertensive crisis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy. A 47-year-old man with chronic back pain, treated with clonidine for many years via intrathecal pump (550 mcg/24\u00a0h), presented following a collapse and complaining of sudden worsening of back pain, severe headache, diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting. A few hours prior to presentation, his subcutaneous pump malfunctioned. On presentation, vital signs included pulse 100\u00a0bpm, BP 176/103 mmHg, temperature 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C and O2 saturation 100\u00a0% (room air). Acute clonidine withdrawal with hypertensive crisis was suspected. Intravenous clonidine loading dose and a 50\u00a0mcg/h infusion were commenced. Five hours later, severe chest pain, dyspnoea, tachycardia, hypoxia, with BP 180/120 mmHg and pulmonary edema ensued. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no ST elevation. Repeated intravenous clonidine doses were given (25\u00a0mcg every 5-10\u00a0min), with ongoing clonidine infusion to control blood pressure. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion, positive pressure ventilation and intravenous benzodiazepines were added. Bedside echocardiogram showed stress-induced cardiomyopathy pattern. Serum troponin-I was markedly elevated. His coronary angiography showed minor irregularities in the major vessels. Over the next 3\u00a0days in the ICU, drug infusions were weaned. Discharge was 12\u00a0days later on oral clonidine, metoprolol, perindopril, aspirin and oxycodone-SR. Two months later, his echocardiogram was normal. The intrathecal pump was removed. We report a case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy resulting from the sudden cessation of long-term intrathecal clonidine. This was managed by re-institution of clonidine and targeted organ-specific therapies.",

    "56": "Bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are first-in-class targeted therapies that deliver a new therapeutic opportunity by directly targeting bromodomain proteins that bind acetylated chromatin marks. Early clinical trials have shown promise, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia, and therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanisms is crucial to optimize the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Here we use primary mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells immortalized with the fusion protein MLL-AF9 to generate several single-cell clones that demonstrate resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is not mediated through increased drug efflux or metabolism, but is shown to emerge from leukaemia stem cells both ex vivo and in vivo. Chromatin-bound BRD4 is globally reduced in resistant cells, whereas the expression of key target genes such as Myc remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors, in human and mouse leukaemia cells, is in part a consequence of increased Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling, and negative regulation of this pathway results in restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings provide new insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukaemia, highlight potential therapeutic limitations of BET inhibitors, and identify strategies that may enhance the clinical utility of these unique targeted therapies.",

These new routes allow for the derivatization of the methoxyphenyl and chlorophenyl rings, in addition to the diazepine ternary center and the side chain methylene moiety. Substitution at the level of the side chain methylene afforded compounds targeting specifically and potently engineered BET bromodomains designed as part of a bump and hole approach. We further demonstrate that marked selectivity for the second over the first bromodomain can be achieved with an indole derivative that exploits differential interaction with an aspartate/histidine conservative substitution on the BC loop of BET bromodomains.",

The bonded nature of this column, the Chiralpak(\u00ae) IC, allows for enhanced separation development with a diverse solvent range not amenable to standard coated chiral stationary phases. The ternary eluent system ultimately identified provided isomer resolutions not obtainable via the more established hexane/alcohol or polar organic chromatographic modes.

    "64": "Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, plays a key role in the regulation of neuronal transmission throughout the brain, affecting numerous physiological and psychological processes. Changes in GABA levels provoke disbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals, and are involved in the development of numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. GABA exerts its effects via ionotropic (GABAA) and metabotropic (GABAB) receptors. Both types of receptors are targeted by many clinically important drugs that affect GABAergic function and are widely used in the treatment of anxiety disorder, epilepsy, insomnia, spasticity, aggressive behaviour, and other pathophysiological conditions and diseases. Of particular importance are drugs that modulate GABAA receptor complex, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neuroactive steroids, intravenous and inhalational anesthetics, and ethanol. Molecular interactions and subsequent pharmacological effects induced by drugs acting at GABAA receptors are extremely complex due to structural heterogeneity of GABAA receptors and existence of numerous allosterically interconnected binding sites and various chemically distinct ligands that are able to bound to them. There is a growing interest in the development and application of subtype-selective drugs that will achieve specific therapeutic benefits without undesirable side effects. The aim of this review is to briefly summarize the key pharmacological properties of GABA receptors, and to present selected novel findings with the potential to open new perspectives in the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.",

Serious hepatotoxicity and elevated liver enzymes have been reported in patients receiving OLZ. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the OLZ hepatotoxicity are unknown. 2. In this study, the cytotoxic effect of OLZ on freshly isolated rat hepatocytes was assessed. Our results showed that the cytotoxicity of OLZ in hepatocytes is mediated by overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial potential collapse, lysosomal membrane leakiness, GSH depletion and lipid peroxidation preceding cell lysis. All the aforementioned OLZ-induced cellular events were significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) prevented by ROS scavengers, antioxidants, endocytosis inhibitors and adenosine triphosphate generators. Also, the present results demonstrated that CYP450 is involved in OLZ-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity mechanism. 3. It is concluded that OLZ hepatotoxicity is associated with both mitochondrial/lysosomal involvement following the initiation of oxidative stress in hepatocytes.",

Pregabalin can be prescribed in Turkey at 150-600 mg to treat neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, and as concomitant therapy in adult patients with partial epilepsy. Experimental studies have shown that pregabalin could be beneficial in the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal, as well as for relapse prevention in patients with alcohol dependence. Nonetheless, the number of case reports on the abuse potential of pregabalin has increased. Herein we present a patient with pregabalin dependence. The patient\u0092s underlying alcohol and polysubstance dependence, and symptoms of generalized anxiety were thought to contribute to the development of pregabalin dependence. The patient reported that he had experienced severe withdrawal symptoms when he tried to stop using pregabalin. Bupropion and low-dose quetiapine were added to his paroxetine treatment, and pregabalin was discontinued gradually. Following this treatment the patient had not exhibited any signs of pregabalin dependence for one month.

    "70": "The involvement of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system in schizophrenia is suggested by postmortem studies and the common use of GABA receptor-potentiating agents in treatment. In a recent study, we used a benzodiazepine challenge to demonstrate abnormal GABAergic function during processing of negative visual stimuli in schizophrenia. This study extended this investigation by mapping GABAergic mechanisms associated with face processing and social appraisal in schizophrenia using a benzodiazepine challenge. Fourteen stable, medicated schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients (SZ) and 13 healthy controls (HC) underwent functional MRI using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) technique while they performed the Socio-emotional Preference Task (SePT) on emotional face stimuli (\"Do you like this face?\"). Participants received single-blinded intravenous saline and lorazepam (LRZ) in two separate sessions separated by 1-3weeks. Both SZ and HC recruited medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate during the SePT, relative to gender identification. A significant drug by group interaction was observed in the medial occipital cortex, such that SZ showed increased BOLD signal to LRZ challenge, while HC showed an expected decrease of signal; the interaction did not vary by task. The altered BOLD response to LRZ challenge in SZ was significantly correlated with increased negative affect across multiple measures. The altered response to LRZ challenge suggests that abnormal face processing and negative affect in SZ are associated with altered GABAergic function in the visual cortex, underscoring the role of impaired visual processing in socio-emotional deficits in schizophrenia.",

Contradictory results were reported however, concerning the effects of NO donors in animal models of anxiety disorders. The present study investigated the effects of the NO donor molsidomine on anxiety-like behaviour and compared them with the anxiolytic diazepam in rats. For this purpose, the light/dark and the open field tests were used. The effects of molsidomine on motility were also assessed. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of molsidomine (1 and 4mg/kg) did not influence rats' performance either in the light/dark or in the open field test. Administration of 2mg/kg molsidomine significantly prolonged the time spent in the light chamber in the rats compared with the vehicle-treated animals, did not affect the first latency to enter the dark chamber and did not influence the number of transitions between the light and dark compartments of the apparatus. In the open field test, rats that received 2mg/kg molsidomine spent more time in the central zone of the apparatus and exhibited an increment of rearing episodes compared with control and to molsidomine 1 and 4mg/kg-treated rats. Nevertheless, molsidomine, at any dose tested, did not alter locomotor activity compared with vehicle-treated rats in a motility test. The present results indicate that the 2mg/kg molsidomine induced anxiolytic-like effects in the light/dark and open field tests in the rat cannot be attributed to changes in locomotor activity. The magnitude of the molsidomine (2mg/kg)-induced anxiolytic-like effects was not different to that produced by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (1mg/kg).",

The importance of screening and identification of ICU delirium has been identified in both adult and pediatric literature. Delirium increases ICU morbidity, length of mechanical ventilation and length of stay. The objective of this study was to determine the current knowledge level about delirium and its risk factors among pediatric critical care nurses through a short questionnaire. We hypothesized that before a targeted educational intervention, PICU care providers do not have an adequate knowledge base for accurate screening and diagnosis of delirium in critically ill children. A 17 question online survey was given to all nurses in a tertiary 36-bed PICU to assess current knowledge about delirium in children. The response rate was 73% (105/143). When asked to identify the correct way to diagnose pediatric delirium, 11.4% of nurses surveyed (12/105) incorrectly believed that Glasgow Coma Score is the appropriate screening tool. A large proportion of respondents (40/105) believed that benzodiazepines are helpful in treatment of delirium. The results of the survey identified specific knowledge gaps about risk factors and treatment of pediatric delirium in the critically ill child. There is a critical need for education about pediatric delirium and its risk factors among PICU staff prior to unit-wide implementation of a delirium screening and prevention program, specifically with regards to screening methods and pharmacologic risk factors. These results are likely generalizable to all physicians, nurses and staff who care for critically ill children.",

No significant decrease in hyperactivity/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold.

    "83": "Cerebral ischemia is the third most common cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide. Beyond a shortage of essential metabolites, ischemia triggers many interconnected pathophysiological events, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective mechanisms of JM-20, a novel synthetic molecule, focusing on the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway and glial cell response as potential targets of JM-20. For this purpose, we used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to achieve ischemic/reperfusion damage in\u00a0vitro. Treatment with JM-20\u00a0at 0.1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcM reduced PI incorporation (indicative of cell death) after OGD. OGD decreased the phosphorylation of Akt (pro-survival) and GSK 3\u03b2 (pro-apoptotic), resulting in respective inhibition and activation of these proteins. Treatment with JM20 prevented the reduced phosphorylation of these proteins after OGD, representing a shift from pro-apoptotic to pro-survival signaling. The OGD-induced activation of caspase-3 was also attenuated by JM-20 treatment at 10\u00a0\u03bcM. Moreover, in cultures treated with JM-20 and exposed to OGD conditioning, we observed a decrease in activated microglia, as well as a decrease in interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 release into the culture medium, while the level of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased. GFAP immunostaining and IB4 labeling showed that JM-20 treatment significantly augmented GFAP immunoreactivity after OGD, when compared with cultures exposed to OGD only, suggesting the activation of astroglial cells. Our results confirm that JM-20 has a strong neuroprotective effect against ischemic injury and suggest that the mechanisms involved in this effect may include the modulation of reactive astrogliosis, as well as neuroinflammation and the anti-apoptotic cell signaling pathway.",

Multivariate analysis on metabolic profiles of the piriform cortex and cerebellum of mice revealed that diazepam could relieve mice suffering from the convulsive seizures by recovering destructed neurotransmitter and neuromodulator metabolism, ameliorating oxidative stress, alleviating the disturbance in energy, amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism in anisatin intoxicated mice. This integrated metabolomics study provided a powerful and highly effective approach to elucidate therapeutic effects and assessed the safety of diazepam.

    "86": "We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder, identified from published and unpublished sources between 1988 and Sept 13, 2013. We analysed interventions by class and individually. Outcomes were validated measures of social anxiety, reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) compared with a waitlist reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003146.", 
    "87": "We included 101 trials (13\u2008164 participants) of 41 interventions or control conditions (17 classes) in the analyses. Classes of pharmacological interventions that had greater effects on outcomes compared with waitlist were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD -1\u00b701, 95% credible interval [CrI] -1\u00b756 to -0\u00b745), benzodiazepines (-0\u00b796, -1\u00b756 to -0\u00b736), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs; -0\u00b791, -1\u00b723 to -0\u00b760), and anticonvulsants (-0\u00b781, -1\u00b736 to -0\u00b728). Compared with waitlist, efficacious classes of psychological interventions were individual cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT; SMD -1\u00b719, 95% CrI -1\u00b756 to -0\u00b781), group CBT (-0\u00b792, -1\u00b733 to -0\u00b751), exposure and social skills (-0\u00b786, -1\u00b742 to -0\u00b729), self-help with support (-0\u00b786, -1\u00b736 to -0\u00b736), self-help without support (-0\u00b775, -1\u00b725 to -0\u00b726), and psychodynamic psychotherapy (-0\u00b762, -0\u00b793 to -0\u00b731). Individual CBT compared with psychological placebo (SMD -0\u00b756, 95% CrI -1\u00b700 to -0\u00b711), and SSRIs and SNRIs compared with pill placebo (-0\u00b744, -0\u00b767 to -0\u00b722) were the only classes of interventions that had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebo. Individual CBT also had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy (SMD -0\u00b756, 95% CrI -1\u00b703 to -0\u00b711) and interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy (-0\u00b782, -1\u00b741 to -0\u00b724).",

    "90": "Acute pancreatitis can be attributed to numerous potential causes, such as alcohol abuse, chololithiasis, infection, lesions, tumors, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, and medications. Among psychotropic medications, the use of some atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone, has been implicated in the development of acute pancreatitis, although the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. We describe the case of a young man with no other major medical problems, alcohol abuse or predisposing factors, who developed acute necrotizing pancreatitis following olanzapine administration, possibly through severe elevation of serum triglycerides. A pharmacogenomic analysis revealed the presence of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C, G protein-coupled (HTR2C) -759C genotype which is related to increased risk for metabolic syndrome.", 
    "91": "A number of atypical antipsychotic drugs were demonstrated to have anxiolytic effects in patients and in animal models. These effects were mostly suggested to be the consequence of the drugs' affinity to the serotonin system and its receptors. Asenapine is a relatively new atypical antipsychotic that is prescribed for schizophrenia and for bipolar mania. Asenapine has a broad pharmacological profile with significant effects on serotonergic receptors, hence it is reasonable to expect that asenapine may have some anxiolytic effects. The present study was therefore designed to examine possible effects of asenapine on anxiety-like behaviour of mice.", 
    "92": "Male ICR mice were repeatedly treated with 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg injections of asenapine and then tested in a battery of behavioural tests related to anxiety including the open-field test, elevated plus-maze (EPM), defensive marble burying and hyponeophagia tests. In an adjunct experiment, we tested the effects of acute diazepam in the same test battery.", 
    "93": "The results show that diazepam reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM, the defensive marble burying test and the hyponeophagia test but not in the open field. Asenapine has anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM and the defensive marble burying tests but had no effects in the open-field or the hyponeophagia tests. Asenapine had no effects on locomotor activity.",

The proportion of patients with bipolar disorder using antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and anticonvulsants increased over the study period, while the proportion of patients using lithium, typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines/sedatives decreased. The proportion of patients treated with antidepressant monotherapy decreased from 20.5% in 1997 to 12.1% in 2012, and among antidepressant users, the proportion in monotherapy decreased from 47.7% to 23.9%, primarily driven by a decrease in the use of tricyclic antidepressants.",

The history and clinical presentation were reviewed from the electronic medical records. MRI scans were evaluated from the picture archiving and communication system. We performed a comprehensive review of the English medical literature for prior published cases of DPHL and describe the key imaging findings that have been reported related to this condition.", 
    "101": "A total of five patients were identified, including four patients with respiratory failure due to drug overdoses from benzodiazepines, opioids, and/or barbiturates, and one patient who presented after cardiopulmonary arrest due to pulmonary embolism. All patients showed diffuse, extensive, and confluent white matter signal abnormalities including prominent restricted diffusion, extending to the subcortical white matter and respecting the U-fibers. There was no gyral edema or contrast enhancement. In one case histopathology was available, which highlighted patchy subcortical myelin loss with sparing of U-fibers and demonstrated prominent macrophage/microglial inflammation with extensive axonal damage. Of the other four patients, two were at their neurological baselines and two had persistent neurological deficits at the time of discharge.",

To assess the severity and dynamics of their condition, we administered psychopathological analysis and common psychometric scales as well as our own version of the scale for benzodiazepine dependence.", 
    "110": "The diagnosis of drug dependence was based on the three criteria: symptoms of pathological dependence of benzodiazepine, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome with severe somatic/autonomic symptoms and exacerbation of dependence, increase in tolerability to benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics; 64.3% of the patients met these criteria. An analysis of risk factors for this disease in elderly demonstrated the higher risk in patients aged \u2264 60 years and in those who used diazepam. The risk was higher in patients who preferred phenazepam.",

    "114": "The positive effect of phenazepam was achieved earlier in the optimization of treatment with selank on HDRS. The combined treatment decreased the level of undesirable side-effects of phenazepam (attention and memory impairment, asthenia, sedation, increase in sleep duration, sexual disturbances, emotional indifference and orthostatism) during the course of treatment and after the tranquilizer withdrawal. Taken together, the therapeutic efficacy and reduction of side-effects had a positive impact on the quality-of-life of the patients treated with selank as add-on to phenazepam.", 
    "115": "The results extend therapeutic possibilities of treatment of anxietyspectrum disorders with the combination of benzodiazepine tranquilizers and selank.",

    "117": "The increasing request for procedural sedation will create in the upcoming future the need for a specific training in delivering care to patients in a continuum of sedation, whose effects and adverse events are unpredictable. The main debate in the past years has been focused on using drugs that could have few adverse effects and could be considered well tolerated when administered by a nonanaesthesiologist. Propofol remains the most used drug for procedural sedation, but given its side-effects, its administration is limited and suggested only when an anaesthesiologist is available. The main studies recently appearing in the literature are focusing on the use of alternative drugs such as dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, fospropofol, ketofol and remimazolam. The current study is an overview of the different fields of procedural sedation, describing the evidence from the published studies and some upcoming studies.", 
    "118": "Propofol is still considered as the drug of choice, and a recent study on its administration in the emergency department by nonanaesthesiologists has revealed a reduced number of adverse events. Dexmedetomidine is considered, at present, the most commonly used alternative to propofol, given its greater safety in terms of haemodynamic stability and lack of respiratory depression. Remifentanil has been suggested as the 'solo' drug during procedural sedation by target-controlled infusion, but it needs a controlled environment and skilled practitioners. Fosprofol and ketofol are new alternatives, but convincing studies that could support their wider use are absent. Remimazolam is another alternative whose efficacy is still to be determined. Most of the studies in the literature are debating on the training that the 'proceduralist' should undergo to deliver sedation safely and to manage any kind of adverse effect caused by it.", 
    "119": "Recent studies on procedural sedation are still debating on the use of propofol by nonanaesthesiologists and are exploring the use of other sedatives and analgesics. The main goal in the future should be to have a clear curriculum on the role of the 'sedationalist' outside the operating room.", 
    "120": "The common comorbidities associated with COPD include, among others, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, for which the typical treatment involves the use of benzodiazepines (BZD). However, these medicines should be used with extra caution among COPD patients, since treatment with traditional BZD may compromise respiratory function.", 
    "121": "This study investigated the use of BZD among persons suffering from COPD by analyzing three relevant indicators: 1) the sum of defined daily doses (DDD); 2) the number of prescribers involved; and 3) the number of different types of BZD used.", 
    "122": "The study builds on a linkage of national prescription data and patient-administrative data, which includes all Norwegian drug prescriptions to persons hospitalized with a COPD diagnosis during 2009, amounting to a total of 5,380 observations. Regression techniques were used to identify the patients and the clinical characteristics associated with BZD use.", 
    "123": "Of the 5,380 COPD patients treated in hospital during 2009, 3,707 (69%) were dispensed BZD during the following 12 months. Moreover, they were dispensed on average 197.08 DDD, had 1.22 prescribers, and used 0.98 types of BZD during the year. Women are more likely to use BZD for all levels of BZD use. Overnight planned care not only increases the risk of BZD use (DDD), but also the number of prescribers and the types of BZD in use.", 
    "124": "In light of the high levels of BZD prescription found in this study, especially among women, it is recommended that general practitioners, hospital specialists, and others treating COPD patients should aim to acquire a complete picture of their patients' BZD medication before more is prescribed in order to keep the use to a minimum.", 
    "125": "Loperamide, a common over-the-counter antidiarrheal drug and opioid derivative, is formulated to act upon intestinal opioid receptors. However, at high doses, loperamide crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches central opioid receptors in the brain, leading to central opiate effects including euphoria and respiratory depression. We report the case of a young man found dead in his residence with a known history of drug abuse. At autopsy, the only significant findings were a distended bladder and bloody oral purge. Drug screening found nontoxic levels of alprazolam, fluoxetine, and marijuana metabolites. Liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry found an unusual set of split isotope peaks consistent with chlorine. On the basis of autopsy and toxicological findings, loperamide toxicity was suspected because of its opioid properties and molecular formula containing chlorine. A sample of loperamide was analyzed by liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, resulting in a matching mass and retention time to the decedent's sample. Subsequently, quantitative testing detected 63 ng/mL of loperamide or more than 6 times of therapeutic peak concentration. Cause of death was determined as \"toxic effects of loperamide with fluoxetine and alprazolam.\" Because of its opioid effects and easy accessibility, loperamide is known as \"poor man's methadone\" and may go undetected at medical and forensic drug screening.", 
    "126": "In this paper, preparation, characterization and application of a new sensor for fast and simple determination of trace amount of diazepam were described. This sensor is based on Ag nanodendrimers (AgNDs) supported by graphene nanosheets modified glassy carbon electrode (GNs/GCE). The AgNDs were directly electrodeposited on the surface of electrode via potentiostatic method without using any templates, surfactants, or stabilizers. The structure of the synthesized AgNDs/GNs was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The nanodendrimers with tree-like and hierarchical structures have a fascinating structure for fabrication of effective electrocatalysts. The experimental results confirmed that AgNDs/GNs/GC electrode has good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of diazepam. A low detection limit of 8.56\u00d710(-8)M and a wide linear detection range of 1.0\u00d710(-7) to 1.0\u00d710(-6)M and 1.0\u00d710(-6) to 20\u00d710(-6)M were achieved via differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The proposed electrode displayed excellent repeatability and long-term stability and it was satisfactorily used for determination of diazepam in real samples (commercially tablet, injection and human blood plasma) with high recovery.",

    "131": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is most frequently indicated for episodes of melancholic depression, but is also useful in the treatment of maniac syndrome and some schizophrenia subtypes. ECT is part of the treatment of movement disorders, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and even in the treatment of severe conversions. Although the therapeutic results are excellent when used appropriately, the mortality rate is estimated between 2\u00a0and 4\u00a0for 100,000\u00a0shocks. Despite this mortality rate, the benefit-risk ratio remains very positive and serious complications are extremely rare. ECT results in a biphasic cardiological effect: firstly a perstimulus parasympathetic hypertonia contemporary to the seizure's tonic phase, then a phase of contemporary sympathetic hypertonia during the epileptic clonic movement. We will focus on the perstimulus asystole as it is by far the most frequent. Very few cases and even less studies have been referenced in the literature; here, we present a clinical case followed by a discussion.", 
    "132": "The patient is in his fifties and has been treated for many years for a unipolar mood disorder with recurrent melancholic depressive episodes. With each new depressive episode, the clinical evolution is rapidly positive after a few sessions of ECT. Maintenance ECT was not retained due to the supra-annual periodicity of the melancholic depressive episodes and rapid recovery after electric treatment. Then, this patient developed another depressive decline in mood comparable to the previous one, despite adapted blood lithium levels associated with a new generation antidepressant treatment. According to his history, a hospitalisation was programmed to carry out a new course of ECT. Considering the short duration of the first seizures, the intensity of the stimulus was progressively increased. At 180\u00a0joules, the patient presented an immediate per-stimulus asystole of 20seconds which ceased spontaneously. The specialized cardiologic consultation following the rhythmic episode was reassuring: the patient's cardiac condition remained stable. However, after discussion with the patient and his family, we decided to stop the ECT. Was this a reasonable decision?", 
    "133": "According to the literature, the patient's medical history, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, the shock parameters (level of energy applied, duration of the stimulus, number of shocks) and clinical results, are not predictive factors in the occurrence of an asystole. Concerning the ECT protocol, the vagus nerve seems less stimulated during bifrontal stimulations in opposition to unilateral stimulations. Perasystolic patients are younger and have less prior history of cardiovascular disease or ECG abnormalities. Although the patients receiving ECT are often taking several medications (antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticholinergic correctors, calcium channel blockers, loop diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors), these drugs are not considered as facilitating asystoles. No increase in the frequency of asystole had been observed when taking an average dose psychotropic treatment allowing the continuation of an antidepressant treatment at the recommended dose. Differently, lithium is regularly stopped during the shock phase as it could -\u00a0even a few days after being stopped\u00a0- potentiate the effects of succinylcholine and increase the vagal tone. Succinylcholine seems to promote asystole, whilst caffeine, methohexital and trimethaphan do not. The hypersympathetic phase can be controlled by a betablocker (propranolol, esmolol, labetalol) that does not increase the prior risk of asystole. Anticholinergic premedication using atropine does not appear to be systematic and could even potentially induce tachy-dysarrhythmia. However, in the case of perstimulus asystole, most authors recommend continuing the shocks with doses of atropine around 0.4\u00a0to 1mg.", 
    "134": "Vagal stimulation is preferentially central and directly linked to the electric excitation of the lateral dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Younger patients with no cardiac history are more at risk. This could be explained by the fact that juvenile tissue conducts electricity more rapidly than senescent (the difference being probably due to the fibrosis and adipose tissue which reduce its conductive capacity). Finally, it is appropriate to question the direct therapeutic aspect of vagal stimulation which constitutes an experimental treatment of resistant depression.", 
    "135": "The occurrence of perstimulus asystole is not considered as a serious complication of ECT and therefore as a contra-indication to any future sessions. On the contrary, most authors are campaigning for the continuation of shocks with the possibility of adding prophylactic intravenous atropine. Cardiac arrest reminds us that ECT requires a special attention to its cardiovascular effect, which emphasizes the role of interdisciplinarity between anaesthesiologists and psychiatrists.", 
    "136": "The elderly are particularly vulnerable to the iatrogenic effects of drugs that are a major public health problem. In a geriatric care unit of a psychiatric hospital, the pharmacist, in close cooperation with the various health professionals, takes part in the optimization of drug therapy of these patients during cross-professional consultation meetings. From 2009 to 2011, an evaluation of professional practices was run through a targeted clinical audit on the theme of \"prescription drugs at the age of 75 and over\". The main objective of this study is to measure the differences between the practices and the guidelines for prescription drugs concerning the elderly, and then to analyze and amend these differences. The secondary objective is to gather data on the prescription drugs for the elderly in the particular context of a psychiatric unit.", 
    "137": "The evaluation was performed using two standards: the evaluation chart of prescriptions of the Professional College of French Geriatrics (CPGF) and the French National Authority for Health and the list of Laroche et al. In the first round, after analyzing the prescriptions of 105\u00a0patients, the gap between practice and accepted standards led to the definition of three areas of improvement on the associations of neuroleptics, on the use of anticholinergic drugs and on the prescription of benzodiazepines, the latter being subject of another communication. After reassessment, the prescriptions of 101\u00a0patients were thereafter analyzed in relation to the identified areas of improvement.", 
    "138": "Patient samples of both phases were statistically homogeneous. Between the two evaluations, the percentage of prescriptions with at least two neuroleptics remained stable, the decline was not significant (18.1% to 13.9%, P\u22650.05). However, it was observed that the second suggested a \"conditional\" decline with dosages less than or equal to those recommended for the elderly dosages. The proportion of patients who did not take anticholinergic drugs increased from 30% to 60% (P\u22640.01). In parallel to the improvement of these criteria, it was noted that the average number of psychotropic drugs prescribed was significantly reduced (from 3.3 to 2.79\u00a0psychotropic/patients, P=0.078).", 
    "139": "The involvement of a pharmacist in cross-professional meetings of a care unit of psychiatry for the elderly has contributed in setting up a clinical audit focused on the drug management of these patients. This work enabled measurement of the progress made in the use of anticholinergic drugs, following the guidelines. In the mean time, it has been highlighted that the standards used are difficult to comply with regarding some criteria. For instance, the use of neuroleptics in the case of elderly patients hospitalized in the unit of psychiatry and not in the unit of geriatrics requires specific adjustments. Indeed, there are patients whose disorders have led to psychiatric hospitalization, which may require a combination of two neuroleptics. This paved the way for us to develop, within a working group representative of all professionals involved, a list fitting our medical practice and integrated into a guidebook adapted to the drug therapy management of elderly patients in psychiatry. The approach being successful, this targeted clinical audit will be extended to patients aged 75\u00a0years and over, hospitalized in other care units of the hospital.",

All patients had pathologic perifocal findings on both of the PET modalities as well as on the whole-brain MRI. The volumetric data of the PET and MRI abnormalities within the resected temporal lobe were estimated by automated quantitative voxel-based analysis. The obtained volumetric data were investigated in relation to the outcome subgroups of patients (Engel classification) determined at the 2-year post-operative follow-up.",

    "144": "The dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety, particularly in panic disorder (PD). Evidence obtained with animal models indicates that different neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in this midbrain area are involved in the regulation of anxiety- (e.g. inhibitory avoidance) and panic- (e.g. escape) associated defensive behaviors. Earlier findings showed that activation of serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptors in the DPAG inhibits escape expression, a panicolytic-like effect. Recently gathered evidence shows that different classes of antipanic drugs, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant fluoxetine or the benzodiazepine alprazolam, enhance the inhibitory action of 5-HT upon these receptors. They also show that opioidergic mechanisms, through the activation of \u03bc-receptors, contribute to this process. As with 5-HT, activation of GABAA or GABAB receptors, or cannabinoid type 1receptors as well as the tropomyosin-related kinase B receptors by brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the DPAG also inhibits escape expression. There is evidence that chronic antidepressant treatment, besides facilitating 5-HT/opioid neurotransmission, also increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in this area with an impact on its panicolytic effect. On the other hand, facilitation of corticotrophin releasing factor- or cholecystokinin-mediated neurotransmission in the DPAG, via CRF1 and CCK2 receptors, respectively, causes panicogenic-like effects with implications for the pathogenesis of PD. A better understanding of the neurochemical control of defense in the DPAG may foster the development of new strategies for pharmacological treatment of PD.", 
    "145": "Meal-induced insulin sensitization (MIS), an endogenous adaptive mechanism is activated post-prandially. Reduced MIS leads to diabetes, but its activation improves insulin sensitivity. MIS is preserved to single olanzapine administration, therefore we aimed to investigate the chronic effect of olanzapine on fasted-state insulin sensitivity and on MIS in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Daily food and water intake, stool and urine production and body weight were determined. The MIS was characterized by a rapid insulin sensitivity test. Fasting hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were determined by a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamping supplemented with radiotracer technique. Fasted and post-prandial blood samples were obtained for plasma insulin, leptin, ghrelin, amylin, GLP-1, GIP, PYY and PP determination. Adiposity was characterized by weighing intra-abdominal and inguinal fat pads. Olanzapine caused hepatic insulin resistance and a reduced metabolic clearance rate of insulin, but the MIS retained its function. Body weight and adiposity were enhanced, but olanzapine failed to increase food intake. Fasting insulin and leptin were elevated and the post-prandial reduction in ghrelin level was inhibited by olanzapine.The MIS remained functionally intact after long-term olanzapine treatment. Altered insulin, leptin and ghrelin levels indicate olanzapine-induced metabolic derangements. Pharmacological activation of MIS could potentially be exploited to treat or prevent olanzapine-induced insulin resistance.", 
    "146": "Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome which is common in all medical settings. It often goes unrecognized due to difficulties in the detection of its hypoactive variant. This review aims to provide an up-to-date account on recent research on hypoactive delirium (HD). Thirty-eight studies, which were conducted in various clinical settings, including the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), were included in this review. Those studies involved recent research that has been published during the last 6 years. Prevalence of HD was found to vary considerably among different settings. HD seems to be more common in critically ill patients and less common in patients examined by consultation-liaison psychiatric services and in mixed patient populations. The presence of HD in ICU patients was associated with higher short- and long-term mortality and other adverse outcomes, but no such association was reported in other settings. Research on other possible associations of HD with clinical variables and on symptom presentation yielded inconclusive results, although there is some evidence for a possible association of HD with benzodiazepine use. There are several methodological issues that need to be addressed by future research. Future studies should examine HD in the primary care setting; treatment interventions should also be the objective of future research.",

    "153": "When medications of appropriate molecular character and concentration are delivered intranasally, they are quickly transported across this capillary network and delivered to the systemic circulation, thereby avoiding the absorption-limiting effects of first-pass metabolism. Therapeutic drug concentrations are rapidly attained in the cerebrospinal fluid, making intranasal administration a very effective mode of delivery. To optimize the bioavailability of intranasally administered drugs, providers must minimize the barriers to absorption, minimize the volume by maximizing the concentration, maximize the absorptive surface of the nasal mucosa, and use a delivery system that maximizes drug dispersion and minimizes drug runoff. Medications can be instilled into the nasal cavity with syringes or droppers by applying a few drops at a time or via atomization. The intranasal route of administration may be advantageous for patients who require analgesia, sedation, anxiolysis, termination of seizures, hypoglycemia management, narcotic reversal, and benzodiazepine reversal in the ED or prehospital settings. Medications that have been studied in the adult population include fentanyl, sufentanil, hydromorphone, ketamine, midazolam, haloperidol, naloxone, flumazenil, and glucagon. The available data do indicate, however, that intranasal administration may be a safe, effective, and well tolerated route of administration.",

Patients who needed sedation for more than 2 consecutive days after undergoing surgery in the Pediatric Surgery Department of our hospital were enrolled for the study. Fifty-six patients (5-14 years old) were randomly divided into midazolam and propofol treatment groups (N = 28 each in each group). Pediatric patients received midazolam or profolol via continuous intravenous administration, and their plasma cytokine levels were compared after 48 h. Cultured rat C6 brain glioma cells were pretreated with a range of concentrations of midazolam or propofol for 60 minutes prior to incubation with 10 ng/mL IL-1\u03b2 in serum-free medium or vehicle for 36 h. IL-6 concentration was subsequently measured using ELISA. In comparison with levels measured before the infusion of midazolam for 48 h, concentrations of all cytokines decreased, with the differences in IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations reaching significance (all P < 0.05). Midazolam significantly suppressed the IL-1\u03b2-induced release of IL-6 in rat C6 glioma cells. This inhibition was concentration-dependent between 0.3 and 3 \u03bcM, with 3 \u03bcM concentration of midazolam decreasing the IL-1\u03b2-induced release of IL-6 by 43.58%. Midazolam can significantly inhibit the release of cytokines in pediatric patients after surgery. One of the mechanisms may be the inhibition of IL-1\u03b2- induced release of IL-6 in the central nervous system.",

    "160": "Piperazine derivatives are a class of psychoactive substances applied in prescription medicines like antidepressants as well as in drugs of abuse. They are known to increase brain levels of catecholamines, likely via reversal of reuptake transporters. However, other mechanisms could also contribute to increased neurotransmitter levels, e.g., reduced inhibitory inputs on catecholaminergic neurons. Inhibition of the main inhibitory input in the brain, the GABAergic system, by piperazine derivatives could contribute to increased neurotransmitter levels. Our previous studies support this by demonstrating that 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (3CPP/mCPP) is an antagonist of the human \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA receptor (GABAA-R). We therefore investigated the effect of 12 additional piperazine derivatives on the function of the human \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA-R expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Tested derivatives included benzylpiperazine (BZP), methylbenzylpiperazines (2/3MBP), phenylpiperazine (PP), methoxyphenylpiperazines (2/3/4MPP/MeOPP), chlorophenylpiperazines (2/4CPP) and fluorophenylpiperazines (4FPP/TFMPP). All derivatives concentration-dependently inhibited the GABA-evoked ion current. Chlorophenylpiperazines were the most potent GABAA-R antagonists; the IC20 value for 1-(2-chlorophenyl)piperazine (2CPP) was 46\u03bcM and 2CPP induced a maximum inhibition of \u223c 90% at 1mM. Derivatives can be ranked as follows from highest to lowest potency based on IC20 values: 2CPP>3MPP>4CPP>4MPP>2MBP>3CPP>PP>4FPP>2MPP>TFMPP>3MBP>BZP. This study demonstrates a novel mode of action of piperazine derivatives, i.e., antagonism of the GABAA-R. This mechanism can result in increased catecholamine levels that indirectly contribute to toxicity, e.g., adverse effects during overdoses. Therefore, this important mode of action is not only relevant for therapeutic psychiatric interventions, but could also proof valuable for therapeutic interventions in intoxications.", 
    "161": "Psychosocial stress is associated with altered immunity, anxiety, and depression. Repeated social defeat (RSD), a model of social stress, triggers egress of inflammatory myeloid progenitor cells (MPCs; CD11b(+)/Ly6C(hi)) that traffic to the brain, promoting anxiety-like behavior. In parallel, RSD enhances neuroinflammatory signaling and long-lasting social avoidant behavior. Lorazepam and clonazepam are routinely prescribed anxiolytics that act by enhancing GABAergic activity in the brain. Besides binding to the central benzodiazepine binding site (CBBS) in the central nervous system (CNS), lorazepam binds to the translocator protein (TSPO) with high affinity causing immunomodulation. Clonazepam targets the CBBS and has low affinity for the TSPO. Here the aims were to determine if lorazepam and clonazepam would: (1) prevent stress-induced peripheral and central inflammatory responses, and (2) block anxiety and social avoidance behavior in mice subjected to RSD.", 
    "162": "C57/BL6 mice were divided into experimental groups, and treated with either lorazepam (0.10mg/kg), clonazepam (0.25mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl). Behavioral data and tissues were collected the morning after the last cycle of RSD.", 
    "163": "Lorazepam and clonazepam were effective in attenuating mRNA expression of CRH in the hypothalamus and corticosterone in plasma in mice subjected to RSD. Both drugs blocked stress-induced levels of IL-6 in plasma. Lorazepam and clonazepam had different effects on stress-induced enhancement of myelopoiesis and inhibited trafficking of monocytes and granulocytes in circulation. Furthermore, lorazepam, but not clonazepam, inhibited splenomegaly and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spleen following RSD. Additionally, lorazepam and clonazepam, blocked stress-induced accumulation of macrophages (CD11b(+)/CD45(high)) in the CNS. In a similar manner, both lorazepam and clonazepam prevented neuroinflammatory signaling and reversed anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior in mice exposed to RSD.", 
    "164": "These data support the notion that lorazepam and clonazepam, aside from exerting anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, may have therapeutic potential as neuroimmunomodulators during psychosocial stress. The reversal of RSD-induced behavioral outcomes may be due to the enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission, or some other off-target effect. The peripheral actions of lorazepam, but not clonazepam, seem to be mediated by TSPO activation.", 
    "165": "This work presents an analytical method for the simultaneous analysis in human urine of 38 pharmacologically active compounds (19 benzodiazepine-like substances, 7 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 4 azole antifungal drugs, 5 inhibitors of the phosphodiesterases type 4 and 3 inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase type 5) by liquid-chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The above substances classes include both the most common \"non banned\" drugs used by the athletes (based on the information reported on the \"doping control form\") and those drugs who are suspected to be performance enhancing and/or act as masking agents in particular conditions. The chromatographic separation was performed by a reverse-phase octadecyl column using as mobile phases acetonitrile and ultra-purified water, both with 0.1% formic acid. The detection was carried out using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometric analyser, positive electro-spray as ionization source and selected reaction monitoring as acquisition mode. Sample pre-treatment consisted in an enzymatic hydrolysis followed by a liquid-liquid extraction in neutral field using tert-butyl methyl-ether. The analytical procedure, once developed, was validated in terms of sensitivity (lower limits of detection in the range of 1-50 ng mL(-1)), specificity (no interferences were detected at the retention time of all the analytes under investigation), recovery (\u226560% with a satisfactory repeatability, CV % lower than 10), matrix effect (lower than 30%) and reproducibility of retention times (CV% lower than 0.1) and of relative abundances (CV% lower than 15). The performance and the applicability of the method was evaluated by analyzing real samples containing benzodiazepines (alprazolam, diazepam, zolpidem or zoplicone) or inhibitors of the phosphodiesterases type 5 (sildenafil or vardenafil) and samples obtained incubating two of the phosphodiesterases type 4 studied (cilomilast or roflumilast) with pooled human liver microsomes. All the parent compounds, together with their main phase I metabolites, were clearly detected using the analytical procedures here developed.", 
    "166": "We aimed to evaluate all-cause mortality of middle-aged and elderly subjects diagnosed with dementia and treated with psychotropic drugs as compared with controls subjects. Using data from the Danish National Patient Registry, n=26,821 adults with a diagnosis of dementia were included. They were compared with 44,286 control subjects with a minimum follow-up of four years and matched on age, gender, marital status, and community location. Information about psychotropic medication use (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics) was obtained from the Danish Medicinal Product Statistics. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with dementia as compared to control subjects. Mortality hazard ratios were increased for subjects prescribed serotonergic antidepressant drugs (respectively, HR=1.355 (SD=0.023), P=0.001 in patients; HR=1.808 (0.033), P<0.001 in controls), tricyclic antidepressants (HR=1.004 (0.046), P=0.925; HR=1.406 (0.061), P<0.001), benzodiazepines (HR=1.131 (0.039), P=0.060); HR=1.362 (0.028), P<0.001), benzodiazepine-like drugs (HR=1.108 (0.031), P=0.078; HR=1.564 (0.037, P<0.001), first-generation antipsychotics (HR=1.183 (0.074), P=0.022; HR=2.026 (0.114), P<0.001), and second-generation antipsychotics (HR=1.380 (0.042), P<0.001; HR=1.785 (0.088), P<0.001), as compared with no drug use. Interaction analysis suggested statistically significantly higher mortality hazard ratios for most classes of psychotropic drugs in controls than in dementia patients. We found that use of psychotropic drugs is associated with increased all-cause mortality in both patients with dementia and control subjects. Thus, the frequently reported increased mortality with antipsychotic drugs in dementia is not restricted to subjects with impaired cognition and is not restricted to only one class of psychotropic drugs.", 
    "167": "The study investigated the share of vagal input at infra- and supra-nodosal level and the contribution of CCK1 and CCK2 receptors to the cardiorespiratory responses produced by an intravenous injection of sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) in anesthetized rats. This compound administered intravenously at a dose of 50\u03bcg/kg induced short-lived decline in tidal volume and respiratory rate resulting in depression of minute ventilation. Midcervical vagotomy had no effect on CCK-8-evoked ventilatory changes, whereas supranodosal denervation abolished slowing down of breathing. Cardiovascular response to CCK challenge was characterized by a transient decrease followed by an augmentation in the mean blood pressure (MAP) in the intact animals. Vagotomy performed at both levels abrogated the declining phase of MAP. Blood pressure changes were associated with decreased heart rate present in all neural states. All cardiovascular and respiratory effects were antagonized by pre-treatment with devazepide-CCK1 receptors' antagonist, whereas CI988-antagonist of CCK2 receptors was ineffective. In conclusion, our results indicate that CCK-8 modulates slowing down of respiratory rhythm via CCK1 receptors located in the nodose ganglia (NG) and depresses tidal volume via central CCK1 dependent mechanism. CCK-8-evoked decline in blood pressure may be due to activation of vagal afferents, whereas pressor responses seem to be mediated by an activation of CCK1 receptors in the central nervous system. Bradycardia was probably induced by the direct action of CCK-8 on the heart pacemaker cells.",

Overall, a significant number of schizophrenic and bipolar patients treated with olanzapine showed \u22653 metabolic alterations in the first month of treatment when compared to those treated with haloperidol. Moreover, the number of olanzapine-treated patients developing metabolic changes in the first month was significantly higher in both diagnostic groups when compared to those who reached metabolic abnormal values in the subsequent 11 months. These data suggest that both antipsychotics could increase the metabolic risk in schizophrenic and bipolar patients with a higher prevalence in olanzapine-treated patients.

FST and FO were tested for their binding activity of the GABAA-benzodiazepine and 5-HT2C receptors, which are well-known molecular targets for sleep aids. We also measured the sleep latency and sleep duration during pentobarbital-induced sleep in mice after oral administration of FST and FO. In GABAA and 5-HT2C receptor binding assays, FST displayed an effective concentration-dependent binding affinity to GABAA receptor, similar to the binding affinity to 5-HT2C receptor. FO exhibited higher affinity to 5-HT2C receptor, compared with the GABAA receptor. The oral administration of FST and FO produced a dose-dependent decrease in sleep latency and increase in sleep duration in pentobarbital-induced hypnosis.

The purpose of this review is to explore the potential use of dexmedetomidine in preventing or managing ICU delirium in older patients. Articles used were identified and selected through multiple search engines, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Keywords such as dexmedetomidine, delirium, geriatric, ICU delirium, delirium in elderly, and palliative were used to obtain the specific articles used for this paper and restricted to articles published in 1990 or later. Articles specifically looking at the use of dexmedetomidine as compared to a study drug and its potential for use in ICU patients, as opposed to overall reviews of dexmedetomidine, were compared. When compared to benzodiazepines for the prevention or treatment of ICU delirium in the elderly, dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduction in delirium, as well as decreased morbidity and mortality. Dexmedetomidine has also been shown to be effective in limiting risk factors associated with ICU delirium such as length and depth of sedation. As opposed to benzodiazepines or opiates, dexmedetomidine provides effective analgesia, sympatholysis, and anxiolysis without causing respiratory depression and allows a patient to more effectively interact with practitioners. The review of these nine articles indicates that these favorable attributes and overall decreased duration and incidence of delirium make dexmedetomidine a viable option in preventing or reducing ICU delirium in high-risk geriatric patients and as a palliative adjunct to help control symptoms and stressors.",

However, it was not initially appreciated that most prepro-orexin synthesizing neurons are almost exclusively concentrated in the perifornical hypothalamus, which when stimulated elicits panic-associated behavior and cardiovascular responses in rodents and self-reported \"panic attacks\" and \"fear of dying\" in humans. More recent studies support a role for the orexin system in coordinating an integrative stress response. For instance, orexin neurons are highly reactive to anxiogenic stimuli, are hyperactive in anxiety pathology, and have strong projections to anxiety and panic-associated circuitry. Although the two cognate orexin receptors are colocalized in many brain regions, the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) most robustly maps to the histaminergic wake-promoting region, while the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) distribution is more exclusive and dense in anxiety and panic circuitry regions, such as the locus ceruleus.

Whether anti-diabetic drugs are efficacious in reversing the direct effects of APs on glucose pathways is largely undetermined. We tested two metformin (Met) doses to prevent impairments seen following a dose of olanzapine (Ola) (3\u200amg/kg); glucokinetics were measured using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HIEC). Met (150\u200amg/kg; n=13, or 400\u200amg/kg; n=11) or vehicle (Veh) (n=11) was administered through gavage preceding an overnight fast, followed by a second dose prior to the HIEC. Eleven additional animals were gavaged with Veh and received a Veh injection during the HIEC (Veh/Veh); all others received Ola. Basal glucose was similar across treatment groups. The Met 400 group had significantly greater glucose appearance (Ra) in the basal period (i.e., before Ola, or hyperinsulinemia) vs other groups. During hyperinsulinemia, glucose infusion rate (GINF) to maintain euglycemia (reflective of whole-body insulin sensitivity) was higher in Veh/Veh vs other groups. Met 150/Ola animals demonstrated increased GINF relative to Veh/Ola during early time points of the HIEC. Glucose utilization during hyperinsulinemia, relative to basal conditions, was significantly higher in Veh/Veh vs other groups. The change in hepatic glucose production (HGP) from basal to hyperinsulinemia demonstrated significantly greater decreases in Veh/Veh and Met 150/Ola groups vs Veh/Ola. Given the increase in basal Ra with Met 400, we measured serum lactate (substrate for HGP), finding increased levels in Met 400 vs Veh and Met 150. In conclusion, Met attenuates hepatic insulin resistance observed with acute Ola administration, but fails to improve peripheral insulin resistance. Use of supra-therapeutic doses of Met may mask metabolic benefits by increasing lactate.",

This study aimed to elucidate the enzymes and pathways involved in the metabolism of OLZ and to determine the kinetics of OLZ oxidation and glucuronidation by human liver microsomes, recombinant cytochrome P450 (rP450) enzymes, and recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (rUGT) enzymes. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed and validated to quantify OLZ, its four oxidative metabolites (N-desmethyl-OLZ, 2-hydroxymethyl-OLZ, 7-hydroxy-OLZ, and OLZ-N-oxide), and two N-glucuronides (OLZ-10-N-glucuronide and OLZ-4'-N-glucuronide). Consistent with previous reports, UGT1A4, CYP1A2, and flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 play major roles in catalyzing the formation of OLZ-10-N-glucuronide, 7-hydroxy-OLZ, and OLZ-N-oxide, respectively. In addition, a previously uncharacterized major contribution of CYP2C8 to OLZ-N-demethylation was demonstrated. The kinetics of OLZ metabolite formation (Km and Vmax) by human liver microsomes, rP450 enzymes, and rUGT enzymes were characterized in the presence of bovine serum albumin [2% (w/v)]. Consistent with the known effect of bovine serum albumin on CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and UGT1A4 activities, Km values reported here are lower than previously reported values for OLZ metabolic pathways. In addition to CYP1A2-mediated OLZ-N-demethylation, these results suggest that other P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C8, contribute significantly to oxidative OLZ metabolism through catalysis of OLZ-N-demethylation.",

    "237": "Fatigue is one of the most important factors which has a considerable influence on treatment and the life quality of oncological patients. The fatigue syndrome is often diagnosed during cancer treatment and this syndrome is not related to the physical effort. Cancer related fatigue is a patient's subjective, psychologically, physically and emotionally based feeling. It is disproportionate to patient's daily activity. The pathogenesis of this syndrome remains still unknown. However, on the basis of various questionnaires, it is possible to test the disease's complex nature. Cancer related fatigue causes deterioration of patient's life along with lower motivation to struggle with the disease. It is thought that the factor which increases the incidence of cancer related fatigue is a long-term use of drugs such as opioids, benzodiazepine, and medicines containing codeine, tranquilizers, anxiolytics and antidepressants. On the basis of the results, one can choose an appropriate treatment method for cancer related fatigue such as rehabilitation, psychotherapy or public assistance. A great number of patients consider excessive fatigue a typical concomitant symptom in neoplastic disease; therefore, they do not report it. It is of a paramount importance to make patients aware of the fact that cancer related fatigue is a serious disease which can be treated."
