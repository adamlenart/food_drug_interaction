    "0": "Selective blockade of a subset of GABA(A) receptors may be involved in the antipsychotic effects of Clozapine and several other antipsychotic drugs. Seven antipsychotic drugs, and 11 drugs classified as antidepressants that only partially reverse the inhibitory effect of 1 microM GABA on [35S]TBPS binding, do not yield additive reversal when tested pairwise with Clozapine, which also only partially reverses the inhibitory effect of GABA. This suggests that all of these antipsychotic/antidepressant drugs may block a common subset of GABA(A) receptors. DMCM and Ro 5-4864 are also partial reversers of GABA's inhibitory effect, but they yield additive reversals when tested pairwise with the antipsychotic/antidepressant drugs, and also with each other, suggesting that DMCM, Ro 5-4864, and the antipsychotic drugs define three heterogeneous subsets of GABA(A) receptors, with variable overlap, depending on the drug. Several potent ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites can block the GABA inhibitory effects of DMCM and Ro 5-4864, but with different patterns: the ligands generally blocked DMCM less potently, but more completely than Ro 5-4864. Ro 5-4864 was not blocked by Flumazenil or CGS-8216, ligands that potently blocked DMCM. Nine additional antipsychotic/antidepressant drugs, as well as Clozapine, and 7 \"classical\" GABA(A) receptor blockers, all of which reversed GABA nearly completely, when tested at lower concentrations that only reverse approximately 20-35%, yielded almost complete additivity when tested pairwise with DMCM or Ro 54864. Another convulsant benzodiazepine, KW-1937, a positional isomer of Brotizolam, fully reverses the inhibitory effect of 1 microM GABA. At a lower concentration yielding about 50% reversal, KW-1937 is completely additive with DMCM, but entirely nonadditive with Ro 5-4864. The 50% reversal obtained with KW-1937 was potently blocked by Triazolam, but with a plateau similar to that obtained with Ro 5-4864. The results with KW- 1937 suggest that its 50% reversal largely corresponds to the reversal obtained with Ro 5-4864, and that virtually all of the [35S]TBPS binding sites inhibited by 1 microM GABA are coupled to benzodiazepine binding sites. The fraction of GABA(A) receptors preferentially blocked by all the antipsychotic/antidepressant drugs, roughly 25% of the [35S]TBPS binding sites inhibited with 1 microM GABA, are sensitive to KW-1937, but not to DMCM or to Ro 5-4864.", 
    "1": "Twenty phenolic compounds, representatives of proanthocyanidins and gallic acid/hexahydroxyldiphenic acid esters of glucose, have been assessed for their ability to inhibit binding of specific radioligands to 16 receptors. The receptors utilized were alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors, adenosine 1, dopamine 1 and 2, muscarinic, Ca2+ channel, sulphonylureas, 5HT1, 5HT1A, 5HT2, histamine 1, benzodiazepine, opiate and Na+/K/ATPase. These phenolic compounds failed to inhibit ligands binding to 10 of the receptors under the test conditions. The most susceptible receptors to phenolic binding were beta-adrenergic, 5HT1 and opiate. Some of the compounds tested showed selectivity for a single or for two receptors. The inhibition of binding of radioligands to receptors by the phenolic compounds cannot be explained solely in terms of phenolic-protein binding. The results indicate that the removal of tannins from plant extracts prior to screening for receptor activities may result in missing biologically active compounds with specificity of action.", 
    "2": "1. The effects of a cholecystokinin agonist and antagonist on morphine antinociception in the tail-flick test have been evaluated. 2. The administration of different doses of caerulein (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) 30 min prior to morphine (1.5, 3 and 6 mg/kg) increased the antinociception induced by morphine in mice. 3. In animals pretreated with cholecystokinin antagonists MK-329 (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg) and L-365,260 (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg), the antinociceptive effect of morphine was not changed. However, high doses (0.5 mg/kg) of each antagonist potentiated the morphine response. 4. Low doses of cholecystokinin antagonists (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg), that did not cause antinociception, when employed in combination with caerulein (0.05 mg/kg) decreased the response of morphine plus caerulein. 5. It is concluded that the cholecystokinin agonist caerulein potentiated the morphine response by stimulation of cholecystokinin-A and/or cholecystokinin-B receptors.", 
    "3": "To elucidate the subtype specificity of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in mediating contractile responses in the lower urinary tract, we investigated contractile and biochemical properties of muscarinic receptors in bladder dome, bladder base and urethra of the rabbit. Isometric contractile response curves to increasing concentrations of carbachol were constructed in the absence and presence of various concentrations of subtype selective muscarinic antagonists. Bladder dome, bladder base, and urethra demonstrate different characteristics in terms of efficacy and potency with respect to carbachol-induced contractile responses. Emax values are significantly larger and ED50 values are significantly smaller in bladder dome and bladder base than in urethra. Calculation of the pA2 values, the negative logarithm of the antagonist affinity constant (KB), for a series of muscarinic antagonists, i.e., atropine (nonselective), pirenzepine (M1 selective), methoctramine (M2 selective), and 4-DAMP (M1/M3 selective) indicate that the carbachol-induced contractile response in bladder dome and bladder base is mediated through the M3 receptor subtype whereas the carbachol-induced contractile response in urethra is probably mediated through the M1 and/or M3 and possibly M2 subtypes. Muscarinic cholinergic antagonists inhibit [3H]quinulidinyl benzilate binding to bladder dome, bladder base and urethra with the following rank order of affinities: atropine > 4-DAMP > methoctramine > pirenzepine. The binding data indicate the predominance of the M2 receptor subtype in all three regions.", 
    "4": "The effect of the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate on the kainate receptor-mediated response was studied in cultured chick spinal cord neurons using the whole-cell voltage-clamp recording technique. Pregnenolone sulfate rapidly and reversibly inhibits the kainate-induced current in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 67 microM and maximal inhibition of 38%. Inhibition by pregnenolone sulfate of the kainate response is not attenuated by increasing concentrations of kainate, suggesting that the blocking action of pregnenolone sulfate is non-competitive. Antagonism of the kainate response by pregnenolone sulfate is neither agonist- nor voltage-dependent, indicating that pregnenolone sulfate does not act as an open-channel blocker. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that pregnenolone sulfate and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466; a potent non-competitive kainate antagonist) do not act through a common site.", 
    "5": "A number of new 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one-based gastrin/CCK-B receptor antagonists related to the archetypal analogue L-365,260, and more closely to the recently reported compound YM022, have been synthesized and evaluated for biological activity. The compounds were screened for their ability to inhibit the binding of [125I]CCK-8 to gastrin/CCK-B receptors prepared from rat brains and that of [3H]L-364,718 to CCK-A receptors from rat pancreas, and were shown to be potent and selective ligands for the gastrin/CCK-B receptor. Functional studies in vivo demonstrated the compounds to be antagonists of the receptor as evidenced by their ability to inhibit pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion in anesthetized rats. More extensive evaluation in vivo included determination of ED50 values in the rat acid secretion model for selected compounds and an examination of the effect of these compounds on pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion in Heidenhain pouch dogs following oral and intravenous administration. Two compounds, i.e. (3R)-N-[1-[(tert-butylcarbonyl)methyl]-2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-5-(2-pyri dyl) -1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]-N'-[3-(methylamino)phenyl]urea, 15c (YF476), and (3R)-N-[1-[(tert-Butylcarbonyl)methyl]-2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-5- (2-pyridyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]-N'-[3-(dimethylamino)phenyl ]urea hydrochloride, 15d, showed potent dose-dependent effects in both models with the former showing excellent oral bioavailability and an ED50 of 21nmol/kg po in dogs. 15c is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of gastro-oesophagal reflux disease (GORD).", 
    "6": "Norwegian physicians have changed their smoking habits to a greater degree than the general population. The fact that relatively few physicians now smoke daily makes it especially interesting to study those who continue to smoke. Differences between groups with varying smoking habits have been studied on the basis of data from the Norwegian Physician Survey. The main sample consisted of 1,047 out of 1,476 randomly selected Norwegian physicians (71%) who responded in 1993 to a mailed questionnaire on lifestyle. 8% of the female and 14% of the male physicians characterized themselves as daily smokers, and 9 and 13%, respectively as occasional smokers. The highest fraction of daily smokers is found among surgical specialists (21%) and the lowest among specialists in community medicine. Compared with the non-smokers, the daily smokers drink more coffee and alcohol, use more benzodiazepines, and have a more sedentary life-style.", 
    "7": "The present study examined roles of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) and CCK-A receptors in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion and gastroduodenal motility in conscious sheep during interdigestive period. Interdigestive exocrine secretion of ovine pancreas changed cyclically corresponding with cycle of duodenal migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC). During second phase of the duodenal MMC, intravenous injection of L364,718 at 2.45 mumol kg-1 inhibited exogenous CCK-8-induced pancreatic exocrine secretion. Intravenous infusion of the antagonist at 2.45 mumol kg-1/5 min for 5 min also inhibited significantly the pancreatic enzyme secretion without CCK-stimulation to half of that in the control, but not the fluid and bicarbonate secretion. Atropine infusion (i.v.) at 72.0 nmol kg-1/5 min significantly inhibited not only enzyme but also fluid and bicarbonate secretion. Corresponding to the inhibition of the exocrine secretion, L364,718 induced premature phase III in duodenal electromyogram (EMG) in three of the five sheep. Omasal EMG was inhibited slightly but significantly by L364,718, however, neither regular ruminal contractions nor abomasal EMG were altered by L364,718. In contrast, the atropine infusion inhibited only amplitude of ruminal contractions. These results suggest that endogenous CCK contributes to the regulation of interdigestive pancreatic exocrine secretion, omasal contractions and duodenal MMC in the ovine gastrointestinal tract via CCK-A receptors.", 
    "8": "Allosterism between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine and picrotoxinin recognition sites on the GABAA receptor was studied in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. The increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding induced by GABA was inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxinin and the decrease in [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding mediated by GABA was reverted by bicuculline. The effects of hexachlorocyclohexanes (the convulsant gamma- and the depressant delta-isomers, both acting at the picrotoxinin recognition site) on GABA and benzodiazepine sites were studied. delta-Hexachlorocyclohexane, but not the gamma-isomer (lindane), increased [3H]flunitrazepam binding in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50: 8.3 microM). This increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding was reduced by bicuculline and picrotoxinin. The gamma-isomer reduced the increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding induced by GABA or delta-hexachlorocyclohexane. Neither delta- nor gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane inhibited [3H]GABA binding. Moreover, the inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding induced by delta-hexachlorocyclohexane was not reverted by bicuculline. The results obtained in this study in vitro agree with the pharmacological properties and the effects of gamma- and delta-hexachlorocyclohexane in vivo. It is concluded that delta-hexachlorocyclohexane acts as a positive allosteric modulator and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane acts as a non-competitive antagonist of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "9": "Osteoporosis is a public health scourge that is usually eminently preventable. Some risk factors, such as low calcium intake, vitamin D deficiency, and physical inactivity, are amenable to early interventions that will help maximize peak bone density. Other risk factors subject to modification are cigarette smoking and excessive consumption of protein, caffeine, and alcohol. Hip fractures are the most serious outcome of osteoporosis, with enormous personal and public health consequences. The ongoing Study of Osteoporotic Fractures has identified additional independent predictors of hip fracture risk, including maternal hip fracture, absence of significant weight gain since age 25, height, hyperthyroidism, use of long-acting benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants, spending < 4 hours a day on one's feet, inability to rise from a chair without using one's arms, poor visual depth perception and contrast sensitivity, and tachycardia. In an individual perimenopausal woman, the risk of osteoporotic fracture and the urgency of estrogen replacement therapy can be best estimated on the basis of bone mineral density, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, coupled with the presence or absence of existing fractures and clinical risk factors evident from the history and physical examination. Estrogen, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates have all been proved effective in retarding postmenopausal bone loss and therefore reducing the risk of fracture. The use of sodium fluoride is more controversial, although a recent study has suggested a possible role for slow-release fluoride combined with high-dose calcium supplementation.", 
    "10": "Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response is the diminution of the startle response when the startle stimulus is preceded by a weaker, non-startle-eliciting stimulus. Deficits in PPI occur in animals following the administration of apomorphine and in schizophrenic patients. In this study, we examined the ability of the novel atypical antipsychotic olanzapine and the cholecystokinin (CCK)-B antagonist LY288513 to reverse the apomorphine-induced disruption of pre-pulse inhibition. Olanzapine (3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg, i.p.), but not LY288513 (1.0-100 mg/kg, p.o.), blocked apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI. These results indicate that olanzapine, but not LY288513, has dopamine antagonist properties in vivo and predict that olanzapine, but not LY288513, will have antipsychotic activity in man.", 
    "11": "Selected drugs from benzodiazepine, anabolic agent and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapeutic classes were extracted from water and serum using a supercritical CO2 mobile phase. The samples were extracted at a pump pressure of 329 MPa, an extraction chamber temperature of 45 degrees C, and a restrictor temperature of 60 degrees C. The static extraction time for all samples was 2.5 min and the dynamic extraction time ranged from 5 to 20 min. The analytes were collected in appropriate solvent traps and assayed by modified literature HPLC procedures. Analyte recoveries were calculated based on peak height measurements of extracted vs. unextracted analyte. The recovery of the benzodiazepines ranged from 80 to 98% in water and from 75 to 94% in serum. Anabolic drug recoveries from water and serum ranged from 67 to 100% and 70 to 100%, respectively. The NSAIDs were recovered from water in the 76 to 97% range and in the 76 to 100% range from serum. Accuracy, precision and endogenous peak interference, if any, were determined for blank and spiked serum extractions and compared with classical sample preparation techniques of liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction reported in the literature. For the benzodiazepines, accuracy and precision for supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) ranged from 1.95 to 3.31 and 0.57 to 1.25%, respectively (n = 3). The SFE accuracy and precision data for the anabolic agents ranged from 4.03 to 7.84 and 0.66 to 2.78%, respectively (n = 3). The accuracy and precision data reported for the SFE of the NSAIDs ranged from 2.79 to 3.79 and 0.33 to 1.27%, respectively (n = 3). The precision of the SFE method from serum was shown to be comparable to the precision obtained with other classical preparation techniques.", 
    "12": "For the detection of psychotropic drugs in human hair we collected hair obtained from 21 corpses that died from an overdose of legal or illicit drugs. These persons were known to have taken psychotropic drugs prior to their death as determined by post-mortem toxicological analysis in blood. After washing, cutting hair into segments of 3 cm, pulverization, enzymatic hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase and solid phase extraction, drugs were identified by GC/MS. For quantification of flunitrazepam we used its metabolite amino-flunitrazepam; for oxazepam and lorazepam we used the hydrolysed forms of the corresponding drugs. In the hair of 21 subjects tested we found in 20 cases nordazepam, in 15 cases diazepam, in 15 cases oxazepam and in eight cases flunitrazepam with maximal concentrations of 1.8, 2.2, 3.4 and 9.5 ng/mg hair respectively. In addition to these compounds, in subject 11 to 21 we also analyzed for and detected amitriptyline (seven positive), carbamazepine (eight positive), lormetazepam (three positive) and lorazepam (one positive) and found maximal concentrations of 106.0, 13.5, 29.0 and 4.9 ng/mg hair respectively. The comparison of hair analysis versus post-mortem blood and tissues analysis of all the drugs studied shows that in 40 cases, where a positive result was found in blood, the corresponding drug could also be detected in hair in 37 cases. Our results show that hair testing is complementary to classical post-mortem analysis in forensic toxicology.", 
    "13": "A sensitive and specific method for the quantitative determination of alprazolam (AL) in hair has been developed. After the addition of deuterium labeled triazolam as an internal standard, hair samples (20 mg) were digested with 1 N NaOH at 40 degrees C overnight. Calibrators containing known concentrations of AL dried onto drug-free hair were also prepared and digested. After digestion, the solution was cooled, adjusted to pH 9 with 6 N HCl and 1 ml of saturated sodium borate buffer was added. The digested solutions were extracted with toluene:methylene chloride (7:3) and the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. Extract residues were treated with BSTFA and 1% TMCS and analyzed on a Finnigan-MAT mass spectrometer in the negative-ion chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Restek-200 capillary column using hydrogen as the carrier gas. The assay was capable of detecting 25 pg/mg of AL and was linear to 250 pg/mg. Intra-assay precision was 11.1% at 25 pg/mg and 5.4% at 150 pg/mg. Inter-assay precision was 11.2% at 25 pg/mg and 5.3% at 150 pg/mg. This method has been used to study the hair incorporation of AL into Long-Evans rats who received 5.0 mg/kg or 7.5 mg/kg i.p. twice a day for 5 days. Preliminary results indicate that the AL concentration in the pigmented and non-pigmented hair on day 14 ranged from 60 to 100 pg/mg.", 
    "14": "To validate information on flunitrazepam use, we investigated human hair for flunitrazepam and its major metabolite 7-amino-flunitrazepam by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in negative chemical ionization mode of detection. Samples were twice decontaminated with methylene chloride, pulverized in a ball mill and 50 mg of powdered hair were incubated in Soerensen buffer (pH 7.6) in the presence of diazepam-d5 used as internal standard. After liquid-liquid extraction of the incubation medium with diethylether-chloroform (80:20, by vol.), the organic phase was evaporated and the dry extract was derivatizated with heptafluorobutyric anhydride. Benzodiazepines were separated on a 30 m capillary column and detected using single ion monitoring. Among 40 hair samples tested (obtained from drug addicts deceased by heroin overdose), 14 were positive for both flunitrazepam and 7-amino-flunitrazepam and 12 for 7-amino-flunitrazepam only. Concentrations ranged from 31 to 129 pg/mg (mean: 60 pg/mg) and from 3 to 161 pg/mg (mean: 46 pg/mg) for flunitrazepam (14 cases) and 7-amino-flunitrazepam (26 cases), respectively. This first report described the detection of flunitrazepam and 7-amino-flunitrazepam in hair of chronic abusers. Due to the low concentrations observed, negative chemical ionization appears to be the alternative to test flunitrazepam and other benzodiazepines in hair.", 
    "15": "According to the laws presently in force in Italy and the guidelines of the Driving Licence Enforcement Commission of Verona, applicants for the driving licence with a history of drug abuse undergo a medical examination, during which complete anamnestic and clinical data are recorded. On this occasion, a hair sample (50-200 mg) is collected and a urinalysis program is started consisting of EMIT controls for opiates, methadone, cocaine, barbiturates, amphetamines, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines and alcohol carried out on eight seriate samples, collected at random over about 40 days under direct supervision. The positive results from urine immunoassays are confirmed by standardized GC/MS methods. The hair samples are screened for morphine and cocaine, the most abused illicit substances in our region, using commercial RIAs adopting cut-off levels of 0.1 ng/mg. All positive samples and about 10% of negative are confirmed by HPLC. In case of confirmed positive results, the applicant is informed: if the subject denies use of opiates or cocaine in the recent months, he or she has the chance of submitting for analysis a new hair sample, which is analyzed in parallel with the hair remaining from the previous assay. In case of persisting denial, claiming analytical interferences by other drugs or endogenous substances, further confirmation of results can be carried out by CE and/or by qualitative MS/MS. In addition, hair sampling from multiple sites (scalp, axillary, pubic hair) with different susceptibility to contamination from the external sources can be carried out to rule out the possibility of passive contamination. At present, we investigate more than 700 subjects per year. The results of this integrated diagnostic strategy are presented and discussed.", 
    "16": "Paired-pulse inhibition was investigated electrophysiologically in the dentate gyrus using hippocampal slices from epileptic El mice. At short interpulse intervals (IPIs), the inhibition was 30% in the El, and 90% in the control ddY mice at the ages of 10 and 15 weeks. No difference in inhibition was observed at the age of 5 weeks. Bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonists, attenuated the inhibition during short IPIs n the ddY mice, while in the El mice, phenobarbital and flunitrazepam, which enhance GABAA receptor function, restored the inhibitory activity comparable to that of the ddY. The disinhibition progressed with growth, closely correlating with seizure development in El mice. These results suggest that decrease in the GABAergic inhibition occurs in the dentate gyrus of the El mice with growth. GABA concentration in the hippocampus was also quantified using HPLC. In El mice, GABA level was significantly lower than that in ddY mice at the ages of 5 and 15 weeks. Thus, the disinhibition observed in the El dentate gyrus at 15 weeks of age does not appear to be directly related to the content of GABA. GABAergic disinhibition suggests possible loss of unknown inhibition control factor(s) in the El dentate gyrus as growth progresses. The growth-dependent disinhibition in the granule cells may be prerequisite for epileptogenesis in El mice.", 
    "17": "Long-term social isolation stress has been shown to cause a decrease in pentobarbital (PB)-induced sleeping time in mice. In the present study, to clarify whether the GABAA/benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor system is involved in the decrease in the hypnotic activity of PB by social isolation stress, we examined the effects of BZD receptor ligands on the PB-induced sleep in group-housed and socially isolated mice. Moreover, we also tested whether social isolation stress affects the ability of GABA to stimulate 36Cl- uptake or the modulatory effect of diazepam and PB and GABA-induced stimulation of 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes prepared from mouse brain. Social isolation stress significantly decreased the PB-induced sleeping time in mice. The BZD receptor diazepam (0.1-0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently prolonged PB sleep in group-housed and isolated mice, but the effect was weaker in isolated mice. In contrast, FG7142 (5-10 mg/kg, i.p.), a BZD receptor inverse agonist, shortened the sleep in group-housed but not in isolated mice. Flumazenil (16.5-33 nmol, i.c.v.), a selective BZD receptor antagonist, caused PB sleep in isolated mice to return to the level of group-housed mice, at the dose that antagonized the effects of diazepam and FG7142 on PB sleep in group-housed mice. However, this antagonist alone produced no effect on PB sleep in group-housed mice. Social isolation stress decreased the ability of GABA (0.6-200 microM) to stimulate 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes but this stress had no effect on PB- and diazepam-induced enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. These results suggest that endogenous substance(s) with an inverse BZD receptor agonist-like property and the changes in the ability of GABA to stimulate chloride ion channels are involved in the decrease in the hypnotic activity of pentobarbital following social isolation stress.", 
    "18": "In 2 young adult women who experienced acute heterocyclic antidepressant intoxication, we found a quite unusual electrocardiographic pattern characterized by abnormal ST-tract elevation in the right precordial leads associated with a marked QRS widening (right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block type). Because serum electrolyte imbalance and acute myocardial ischemic events were excluded, the mechanism by which antidepressant overdose may produce such elevation of the ST tract remains unclear.", 
    "19": "Duodenal administration of casein and oleate increased plasma levels from oral administration of a poorly water-soluble antiepileptic drug as compared to duodenal glucose and saline in a canine model. Pre-treatment with intravenous MK-329, benzodiazepine CCK A-receptor antagonist, blocked the duodenal oleate effect on drug plasma levels in a single dog preliminary study. In a follow-up study, oral drug co-administration with Intralipid increased drug plasma levels as compared to drug co-administration with a noncaloric equivalent-volume load in seven dogs. Pre-treatment with MK-329 reduced drug plasma levels from co-administration with Intralipid toward fasted-state values. While increased drug solubility in the lipid vehicle might have been projected to account for the fed-state effect in the oral studies, the gut peptide inhibitor studies suggest that biliary secretion plays a major role in promoting the dissolution and subsequent absorption of this lipophilic drug. The data also support the hypothesis that meal-enhanced pancreatic secretion provides a greater fluid volume for drug dissolution in the small intestine. An increase in the extent of drug dissolution in the stomach, as a result of meal prolongation of gastric residence time, does not appear to contribute substantially to fed-state increases in drug plasma levels from oral drug co-administration with a lipid meal.", 
    "20": "Anesthetic effects of xylazine, butorphanol, tiletamine-zolazepam, and isoflurane in ratites (9 emus, 3 rheas, 6 ostriches) were determined. Anesthetic treatments included 4 regimens: induction and maintenance of anesthesia with isoflurane, preanesthetic tranquilization with xylazine and butorphanol followed by induction and maintenance of anesthesia with isoflurane, induction of anesthesia with tiletamine-zolazepam and maintenance with isoflurane, and preanesthetic tranquilization with xylazine and butorphanol followed by induction of anesthesia with tiletamine-zolazepam and maintenance with isoflurane. None of the birds developed irreversible adverse effects, but 2 developed brady cardia (1 was treated with atropine and responded) and 2 others developed transient apnea. Intravenous administration of tiletamine-zolazepam produced rapid and smooth induction of anesthesia in adult ostriches.", 
    "21": "The present two experiments examined conditional control by midazolam and amphetamine cues in an appetitive discrimination procedure. In each of two experiments, male Wistar rats were subjected to a small number of two types of training sessions in a conditioning box. During one type of session, a stimulus was consistently followed by food in a magazine, whereas during the other type of session, this very same stimulus was followed by nothing. Groups of rats were injected with either midazolam (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) or amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.), prior to each food-reinforced session, and with saline prior to each food non-reinforced session. Other groups received the reverse treatment. Subsequent non-reinforced test session showed that, in both experiments, only the rats that had been food reinforced in a drug state displayed shorter magazine-response latencies in their previously reinforced than in their previously non-reinforced state, both prior to and during the stimulus. This finding was interpreted as reflecting the joint operation of unconditioned and conditioned drug effects, with the latter being based on occasion setting by the drug cues that was induced by the relatively short discrimination training procedure. The present results parallel those of previous aversive drug-discrimination experiments adopting a similar short discrimination procedure.", 
    "22": "Cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4 is the most abundant human P450 and oxidizes a diversity of substrates, including various drugs, steroids, carcinogens, and macrolide natural products. In some reactions, positive cooperativity has been reported in microsomal studies. Flavonoids, e.g., 7,8-benzoflavone (alpha-naphthoflavone, alpha NF), have been shown to stimulate some reactions but not others. In systems containing purified recombinant bacterial P450 3A4, positive cooperativity was seen in oxidations of several substrates, including testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, amitriptyline, and most notably aflatoxin (AF) B1. With these and other reactions, alpha NF typically reduced cooperativity (i.e., the n value in a Hill plot) while either stimulating or inhibiting reactions. With the substrate AFB1, alpha NF both stimulated 8,9-epoxidation and inhibited 3 alpha-hydroxylation. The same patterns were seen with AFB1 in a fused P450 3A4-NADPH-P450 reductase protein. alpha NF did not alter patterns of activity plotted as a function of NADPH-P450 reductase concentration in systems containing the individual proteins. The patterns of AFB1 oxidation to the two products were modified considerably in systems in which NADPH-P450 reductase was replaced with a flavodoxin or ferredoxin system, iodosylbenzene, or cumene hydroperoxide. AFB2, which differs from AFB1 only in the presence of a saturated 8,9-bond, was not oxidized by P450 3A4 but could inhibit AFB1 oxidation. These and other results are considered in the context of several possible models. The results support a model in which an allosteric site is involved, although the proximity of this putative site to the catalytic site cannot be ascertained as of yet. In order to explain the differential effects of alpha NF and reduction systems on the two oxidations of AFB1, a model is presented in which binding of substrate in a particular conformation can facilitate oxygen activation to enhance catalysis.", 
    "23": "It has been suggested that use of the AND-OR training method may be associated with an enhancement of the pharmacological specificity of discriminations based on mixture of drugs. Rats were trained to discriminate a mixture of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg s.c.) plus midazolam (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) from saline (AND-discrimination, n = 8) or to discriminate the mixture from either drug alone (AND-OR discrimination, n = 6). The studies used two-lever operant procedures with food reinforcers presented on a tandem schedule. After discriminations were acquired to 80% accuracy, the nicotine antagonist mecamylamine (0.03 1.0 mg/kg s.c.) and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (0.32 10 mg kg i.p.) were tested on the response to the mixture of nicotine plus midazolam. The antagonist effects of either mecamylamine or flumazenil given alone were more marked in rats trained under the AND-OR procedure than in rats trained on the AND-discrimination. Similarly, the antagonist effects of mixtures of mecamylamine plus flumazenil were much more potent under the AND-OR than under the AND-discrimination procedure. The AND-OR method reduced the dose of the antagonist mixture needed to produce complete block by a factor of about 10, as compared with the AND-discrimination. These striking differences in sensitivity to antagonists support the view that AND-OR or related procedures may enhance the pharmacological specificity of complex drug discriminations.",

Benzodiazepines give effective palliation of this condition, and, unlike haloperidol and the phenothiazines, do not exacerbate the existing tendency to myoclonus and convulsions.", 
    "25": "In order to obtain information on the functional state of basal ganglia following prenatal benzodiazepine exposure, preprodynorphin mRNA expression and kappa-opioid receptors were studied in offspring of timed-pregnant Long Evans rats treated with diazepam (1.25 mg/kg/day) on gestational days 14 to 20. Preprodynorphin mRNA was localised by in situ hybridization using a 33P-labeled oligonucleotide. Relative optical density (ROD) was quantified by image analysis in four quadrants of caudate putamen, in nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle of adult male rats. Six hours after functional challenge by injection of D-amphetamine (8 mg/kg s.c.), prenatally vehicle-exposed rats exhibited increased preprodynorphin mRNA (ROD) levels in caudate putamen (dorsolateral 187%, dorsomedial 150%, ventrolateral 153%, ventromedial 140% of control), nucleus accumbens (142%) and olfactory tubercle (213%). Prenatal diazepam exposure attenuated the effect of amphetamine in all regions; statistically significant differences between ROD levels of prenatally vehicle/adult amphetamine-treated and prenatally diazepam/adult amphetamine-treated groups were seen in ventrolateral caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. Baseline levels and topographical distribution of preprodynorphin mRNA remained unchanged. kappa-opioid receptor binding was analyzed in membrane from nucleus accumbens + olfactory tubercle, caudate putamen, and midbrain of male and female offspring using [3h]U69593. Bmax was reduced in nucleus accumbens + olfactory tubercle, but not in caudate putamen or midbrain of adult, prenatally diazepam-exposed male offspring, This effect was not yet seen at earlier postnatal stages (14 and 28 days), and was also absent in females. These data indicate that prenatal exposure to diazepam results in a delayed change in the functional state of dynorphin-containing neurons in several parts of the basal ganglia of adult male offspring. The decreased responsiveness to enhanced dopaminergic transmissions may impair the function of basal ganglia circuitry.",

    "27": "Many patients with pain also suffer from depression. The exact relationship between these two problems is unclear but it appears that, in many patients, the depression may not simply be secondary to the pain. When these problems coexist, successful management requires the proper assessment and treatment of both. This paper discusses depressive disorders associated with pain and their treatment, with special focus on medication management.", 
    "28": "The potential effects of zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, on cognitive and psychomotor functions have been explored in more than 30 placebo controlled studies, and in many cases in comparison with benzodiazepine reference hypnotics (ie flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam). Daytime impact of drug administration on alertness has been studied with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and no significant clinical impairment has been found after zolpidem 5 to 10 mg, unlike benzodiazepines. Evaluation of the effects of zolpidem on attention and psychomotor skills (critical flicker fusion threshold, substitution or copying tests, choice reaction times or driving tests, etc) indicate that zolpidem at recommended doses (5 mg in elderly and 10 mg in adults) is unlikely to produce significant detrimental residual effects on daytime vigilance, concentration and coordination performances on the morning after intake. In accordance with its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the effects on zolpidem on memory functions were limited to the first hours after administration and no significant difference was observed between zolpidem (5-10 mg) and placebo 6 hours after administration; longer memory impairment was observed with flunitrazepam or triazolam. Various groups of subjects were included in these studies, both young adults and elderly subjects, healthy volunteers and insomniac patients, and duration of treatment varied between one single dose and 28 days of repeated intake. In conclusion, experimental evidence demonstrates a satisfactory safety profile of zolpidem (5-10 mg) on daytime cognitive functions as compared to other hypnotics.", 
    "29": "The efficacy of zolpidem, a non benzodiazepine hypnotic agent with a short elimination half life, was reviewed, analysing more than 50 international clinical trials published since 1986. The hypnotic activity of zolpidem has been explored in different patient populations including normal volunteers, general practice outpatients and psychiatric out- or in-patients with varying sleep disorders; both transient and chronic. Assessment methods used have included objective and subjective measures of hypnotic efficacy for different treatment durations, with results confirming that 10 mg is superior to placebo. Zolpidem was shown to be superior in most trials on sleep parameters such as total sleep time, sleep onset latency and nocturnal awakenings, but total REM sleep and REM latency were usually unmodified. Zolpidem maintained normal sleep physiology as demonstrated by the preservation of slow wave stages and no, or minimal, effects on sleep architecture after abrupt discontinuation. Consequently, 10 mg is the recommended dose for the short-term treatment of insomnia in the non-elderly; in elderly patients 5 mg has been shown to be effective at inducing sleep whilst giving an optimum safety profile.", 
    "30": "Human peripheral blood cells, especially lymphocytes and platelets, are being studied increasingly in neuropsychiatric research both as tools for investigating systemic disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders, and as peripheral models for getting information on central nervous system biochemistry. In this study, we determined T lymphocyte peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding in parkinsonians and controls: significantly reduced B(max) values were found in patients compared with healthy controls, whereas K(d) values were similar. These data argue for an immune response disturbance and a cell energy metabolism impairment in parkinsonian patients, since cell surface peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are related with the immune function, and mitochondrial binding sites with energy metabolic pathways.", 
    "31": "Neurochemical and behavioural research show that benzodiazepines (BZs) are the well-known anxiolytic drugs which are also used for the treatment of epilepsy, hypnosis and insomnia. Administration of BZs to experimental animals produces anxiolytic-like effects in various animal models and decreases exploratory activity. A role of serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) in both anxiolytic and anti-exploratory effects of BZs have been suggested. Drugs which mimic 5-HT function at the post synaptic sites have been shown to decrease anxiety in experimental animals. The present study analyses regionally specific effects of BZs on brain serotonin metabolism in relation to the reported behavioural and therapeutic profiles of the drugs.", 
    "32": "Although research has consistently demonstrated an increased risk for falls and fall-related fractures among persons receiving benzodiazepine (BZD) medications, the association between new as compared with chronic use and fall-related morbidity among different age groups is less clear. The objectives of this prospective cohort study were to examine the associations between BZD sedative and tranquillizer use and fall-related hospitalizations within 28 days of the fill date, and to explore variations in risks among new (after the first prescription) and chronic (after the third prescription) BZD users of different ages. Data were derived from the Saskatchewan Health linked databases for the years 1979-1986. Fall rates increased with age (especially beyond 70 years) and were highest among those receiving BZD sedatives and tranquillizers compared with controls for both new and chronic users. After adjusting for age, sex and selected health and social factors, a significantly increased risk of fall-related hospitalization was found among new BZD sedative (OR=2.8) and tranquillizer (OR=2.0) users compared with controls, and this risk was only slightly reduced among chronic BZD sedative (OR=2.4) and tranquillizer (OR=1.6) users. These risk estimates were consistent across age, with the exception that chronic BZD tranquillizer use remained significant only among those aged 70 years and older.", 
    "33": "The present study was designed to examine whether disturbance of the enterogastric circulation of diazepam would obviously affect its inhibitory action on CNS. Intragastric administration of acidic liquid (pH 1) elicited a marked increase in the amount of diazepam in the gastric juice of mice 1 h after i.v. diazepam, as measured by HPLC method. The effects of ig acidic charcoal (2 g.kg-1, pH 1), neutral charcoal and normal saline on diazepam-induced CNS depression were compared by studying the duration of hypnotic action, inhibition of spontaneous activity, dropping rate in rotating rod test and mortality after i.v. diazepam (10-40 mg.kg-1) in mice. The results showed that the animals receiving ig acidic charcoal recovered more rapidly from CNS depression and exhibited lower mortality than the animals in neutral charcoal group and normal saline group.", 
    "34": "Mechanisms underlying tolerance to and dependence on the anticonvulsant effect of clonazepam are not clear. Autoradiography of the NMDA receptors in amygdala-kindled rats with tolerance to and dependence on the anticonvulsant effect of clonazepam was carried out. When tolerance developed, the binding of [3H] TCP (N-(1-thieny) cyclohexylpiperidine) to NMDA receptors was found to be increased at the polymorphocellular layer of the right CA1, and decreased at the molecular layer of the cerebellar ansiform lobule. On day 7 of the discontinuation of clonazepam, the binding did not change further. These changes may be responsible for the tolerance to and dependence on the anticonvulsant effect of clonazepam. However, the exact significance of these results should be further investigated.", 
    "35": "In rats rendered hyperlipidemic by the i.p. injection of Triton WR-1339, the i.p. administration of tetrazepam, a benzodiazepine (BZD) used mainly as a central myorelaxant, evoked significant reductions of serum lipids and blood glucose level. The dose-response curve was bell-shaped for serum lipids changes, whereas no clear dose-response relationship for blood glucose level modifications could be established. Tetrazepam was less active on serum lipids than other BZDs as diazepam or midazolam.", 
    "36": "The acute i.p. administration of tetrazepam (5, 7.5, 15 mg/kg) in normoglycemic and normolipidemic rats induced an increase in blood glucose level, a delay of fibrinolysis (when administered at the first two doses) and variable changes of serum lipids. These results are different from those obtained in hyperlipidemic rats treated with tetrazepam.", 
    "37": "Effect of diphenhydramine was investigated on withdrawal signs in lorazepam dependent rats. Physical dependence was produced by giving lorazepam admixed with the food in the following dose schedule: 10 x 4, 20 x 4, 40 x 4, 80 x 4 and 120 x 7 (mg/kg, daily x days). The parameters observed during the periods of administration of lorazepam and after its withdrawal were spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA), body temperature, reaction time to pain, foot shock aggression (FSA) and audiogenic seizures. Diphenhydramine was administered orally in the dose schedules of once daily (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) and twice daily (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) in separate groups during the withdrawal period. The withdrawal signs observed in control group (without diphenhydramine) were hyperkinesia, hyperthermia, hyperaggression and audiogenic seizures. Hyperkinesia and hyperthermia were blocked in all the groups of diphenhydramine-treated rats. FSA was inhibited only by diphenhydramine (10 and 20 mg/kg) given twice daily. Audiogenic seizures were completely blocked by once daily (20 and 40 mg/kg) as well as twice daily (20 mg/kg) doses of diphenhydramine. It may be concluded that diphenhydramine exerts a protective effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "38": "AF-DX 116 is a cardioselective M2 receptor antagonist and, thus, it should induce sinus tachycardia. Since normal ventricular automaticity is suppressed by atrial overdriving, AF-DX 116 might become an antiarrhythmic drug and act by increasing the sinus node automaticity. Ventricular arrhythmia models used in this study were induced either by two-stage coronary ligation, digitalis, or adrenaline in beagle dogs. AF-DX 116 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) tended to increase the sinus rate of the conscious beagles compared to the pre-drug level (although the effect was not significant) but had no antiarrhythmic effect (i.e., there was no decrease in the arrhythmic ratio defined as the number of PVC divided by the total heart rate) on the ventricular tachycardia (VT) induced 24 h after aseptic ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. AF-DX 116 did not alter the blood pressure. The drug also did not suppress digitalis-induced VT and did not increase the atrial rate, which was already increased to about 210 beats/min by ouabain. AF-DX 116 decreased the arrhythmic ratio, 9 min after bolus injection, and increased the atrial rate in the adrenaline VT model. The maximum plasma concentration of AF-DX 116 reached nearly 1microg/ml 1 min after the bolus injections in the digitalis and adrenaline arrhythmia experiments, which is close to the maximum concentration expected to be attained in the clinical application of this drug. Although AF-DX 116 increased the heart rate, under the present experimental conditions of increased atrial rate, the extent of tachycardia was not strong enough to suppress the 24-h coronary ligation and digitalis-induced arrhythmias. The late onset of the antiarrhythmic effect of AF-DX 116 on adrenaline-induced arrhythmia cannot be explained by the overdrive suppression mechanism.", 
    "39": "Systemic pharmacologic treatments may be indicated in conditions in which the distribution of muscle overactivity is diffuse. Antispastic drugs act in the CNS either by suppression of excitation (glutamate) enhancement of inhibition (GABA, glycine), or a combination of the two. Only four drugs are currently approved by the US FDA as antispactic agents: baclofen, diazepam, dantrolene sodium, and tizanidine. However, there are a number of other drugs available with proven antispastic action. This chapter reviews the pharmacology, physiology of action, dosage, and results from controlled clinical trials on side effects, efficacy, and indications for 21 drugs in several categories. Categories reviewed include agents acting through the GABAergic system (baclofen, benzodiazepines, piracetam, progabide); drugs affecting ion flux (dantrolene sodium, lamotrigine, riluzole; drugs acting on monoamines (tizanidine, clonidine, thymoxamine, beta blockers, and cyproheptadine); drugs acting on excitatory amino acids (orphenadrine citrate); cannabinoids; inhibitory neuromediators; and other miscellaneous agents. The technique, advantages and limitations of intrathecal administration of baclofen, morphine, and midazolam are reviewed. Two consistent limitations appear throughout the controlled studies reviewed: the lack of quantitative and sensitive functional assessment and the lack of comparative trials between different agents. In the majority of trials in which meaningful functional assessment was included, the study drug failed to improve function, even though the antispastic action was significant. Placebo-controlled trials of virtually all major centrally acting antispastic agents have shown that sedation, reduction of global performance, and muscle weakness are frequent side effects. It appears preferable to use centrally acting drugs such as baclofen, tizanidine, and diazepam in spasticity of spinal origin (spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis), whereas dantrolene sodium, due to its primarily peripheral mechanism of action, may be preferable in spasticity of cerebral origin (stroke and traumatic brain injury) where sensitivity to sedating effects is generally higher. Intrathecal administration of antispastic drugs has been used mainly in cases of muscle overactivity occurring primarily in the lower limbs in nonambulatory, severely disabled patients but new indications may emerge in spasticity of cerebral origin. Intrathecal therapy is an invasive procedure involving long-term implantation of a foreign device, and the potential disadvantages must be weighed against the level of disability in each patient and the resistance to other forms of antispastic therapy. In all forms of treatment of muscle overactivity, one must distinguish between two different goals of therapy: improvement of active function and improvement of hygiene and comfort. The risk of global performance reduction associated with general or regional administration of antispastic drugs may be more acceptable when the primary goal of therapy is hygiene and comfort than when active function is a priority.", 
    "40": "A 39-year-old patient was admitted to the emergency department for acute abdominal pain. Physical examination showed a peritoneal syndrome. However, CT-scan, Doppler and blood analysis were unremarkable. As the patient had a history of auto-medication with benzodiazepines at high doses, a withdrawal syndrome was considered. An intravenous administration of 3 mg of midazolam determined the relief of all symptoms in a few minutes.",

Microvascular decompression of the auditory-vestibular nerve in 207 patients with DPV resulted in a cure rate of 79%. However, most of the patients with DPV (approximately 80%) were successfully treated by medication.", 
    "42": "Girisopam (EGIS-5810) is a potent anxiolytic compound. Recent in vitro studies with the substance, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, indicated dose-dependent mutagenic activity. At the same time, in ex vivo bone marrow micronucleus tests performed after treating CFLP mice with extreme oral doses (875, 1300 and 1750 mg/kg) no mutagenic activity could be observed at any of the dose-levels. On the basis of the above results, it seemed reasonable to study the absorption and distribution of radioactivity and particularly its bone marrow penetration after administering tritiated and 14C-labelled girisopam at the same doses as those applied in the micronucleus test. The animals were sacrificed 30 minutes, 2 and 24 hours after treatment and the radioactivity content of blood, plasma and bone marrow was determined. For whole body autoradiography studies, the animals were sacrificed at the same time points, however they were treated with tritium-labelled girisopam. The results indicated that the absorption of radioactivity from the gastro-intestinal tract of the animals started immediately. The samples collected had well measurable radioactivity even 30 minutes after treatment. At the same time, it was also evident, that, in spite of the high doses, the absolute amount of radioactivity was rather low. At both dose-levels, the radioactivity concentration was the highest in samples collected 24 hours after treatment. This results indicated extremely delayed absorption. The radioactivity level of bone marrow was practically the same as that measured in blood. The samples of animals treated with the high-dose had higher radioactivity content, however the increase was not linearly proportional to the dose. Disproportionality can probably be explained by delayed absorption. The whole body autoradiography was in good agreement with the results of quantitative determinations. This results confirmed the observations obtained by ex vivo micronucleus test. The radioactivity penetrated in the bone marrow resulting a long time exposure of the radioactivity without any mutagenic effect.", 
    "43": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is one of the most important inhibitory transmitter in the CNS. When GABA is released in the synaptic cleft, it can act on two types of receptors, type A (GABAA-R) and type B. The GABAA-R is an ionotropic receptor whose subunits form a chloride channel. It contains specific binding sites at least for GABA, benzodiazepines, picrotoxin, barbiturates, anesthetic steroids, divalent cations such as Zn2+ and other compounds. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that regulate intracellular second messengers may modulate the responses of GABAA-R in the post-synaptic membrane and thus affect the synaptic plasticity. While consensus sites for several kinases are present on many subunit-subtypes, the functional consequences of these phosphorylations are unclear. However, the maintenance of normal GABA currents required the activity of a unique kinase specific for the GABAA-R. This intracellular regulation site might be involved in synaptic plasticity and considered as a site of vulnerability for epileptogenesis. The generation of epileptic discharge, synchronized burst firing and interictal spikes, can be subsequent to the alteration of GABAA-R function. A consequence of GABAergic disinhibition is the formation of new polysynaptic pathways leading to a network of neurons that were previously not connected. Cell loss and plasticity are currently observed in most patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. CA1 pyramidal cells are missing and mossy fibers of dentate granule cells project back through the granule cell layer to form recurrent terminals on granule cell dendrites. This mossy fiber sprouting leads to the destruction of most dentate hilar somatostatine interneurons. Nevertheless, local circuit neurons containing glutamic acid decarboxylase survive in this layer and in all regions of the sclerotic hippocampus. A decrease of the GABA release has been proposed as a basis for disinhibition temporal-lobe epilepsy is partially characterized by a loss of glutamate-stimulated GABA release that is secondary to a reduction in the number of GABA transporters. A molecular reorganization of GABAA-R subunits has been suggested in the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy because the zinc released from abberantly sprouted mossy fiber terminals is responsible for a collapse of augmented inhibition by GABA. These results support the concept of a loss of inhibition in chronic epilepsy models and probably in human epilepsies.", 
    "44": "Despite a considerable wealth of data, the mechanisms responsible for the generation of epileptic bursts in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remain a mystery. Recently, research and therapy have focused on impairment of GABAergic inhibition in epilepsy. Several lines of evidence support this approach: 1-GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the neuronal structures involved in TLE. 2-Enhancers of GABAergic inhibition (such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates) are commonly used as antiepileptic drugs. 3-Interictal discharges can be obtained following the pharmacological blockade of GABAA receptors. Since the axiom at the basis of epilepsy research states that the balance between inhibition and excitation is tipped toward excitation, we have addressed the following question: where are the loci most likely to be involved in such imbalance? We have limited our investigation to the excitatory side of the story. The main glutamatergic excitatory receptors (AMPA and NMDA) involved in TLE and their properties will be first addressed. We will focus on the excitatory synapses most likely involved in epileptogenesis. We have then specifically studied the effects of redox reagents on NMDA receptor-dependent epileptiform activity in a chronic animal model of TLE, the kainic acid lesioned rat hippocampus. We report that oxidizing drugs abolish evoked epileptiform discharges via a decrease by 50 p. 100 of NMDA receptor-mediated responses without affecting synaptic plasticity and thus memory and learning. The dormant cell hypothesis (i.e. the disconnection of inhibitory interneurons from their excitatory afferents) was also tested. We report that interneurons are not dormant in TLE and fire bursts of action potentials during spontaneous or evoked paroxismal activity.", 
    "45": "The aim of research was using midazolam for preoperational medication in children undergoing diagnostic and minor surgical procedures in ophthalmic surgery and estimation of its properties for deep sedation. We used midazolam in children of both sex, from 2 to 10 years of age. All the patients were considered as I or II grade of ASA scale of perioperational risk. Patients were given midazolam orally at dose 0.5 mg per kg of body weight. Sedation degree was assessed according to Addenbrooke's Hospital Scale of Sedation as well as to changes in systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure, pulse oximetry of capillary blood (SpO2) and heart rate (HR). Sedation in all children subjected to the trial was good and optimal conditions to perform the procedures were achieved. We found the level of sedation satisfactory and safe. Measurement of SAP, DAP, SpO2 and HR revealed stability of circulation in the whole perioperative period. We found the sedative properties of midazolam as excellent in the described range of age and useful for the diagnostics and surgery respectively.", 
    "46": "West syndrome is an age-specific epileptic syndrome with onset in infancy. It comprises infantile spasms (usually flexion convulsions), EEG pattern of hypsarrhythmia and mental retardation. Current therapy involves ACTH, corticosteroids, valproic acid, pyridoxine and vigabatrine. The treatment is difficult and more effective antiepileptic drugs are required. Unfortunately, there is no animal model of West syndrome that would accurately depict the situation found in humans. N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA)-induced seizures in infant rats have certain features of the West syndrome model. These seizures are age-specific (they occur before 25 days of age), include hyperflection (emprosthotonus), their EEG is not specific and they somewhat respond to treatment with the benzodiazepine clonazepam. In 12 and 18 day old rats, we tested the effects of hydrocortisone, pyridoxine and sodium valproate against the seizures induced by 15 and 45 mg/kg of NMDA i.p., respectively. There were weak effects of sodium valproate against the NMDA-induced emprosthotonus. In contrast, high doses of pyridoxine were proconvulsant and hydrocortisone worsened the damage of nerve cells induced by NMDA. The data show that NMDA-induced seizures although similar to West syndrome are extremely resistant to therapy and may not be a good model of the West syndrome. However, the search for an adequate model that would allow for determination of possible mechanisms and testing of putative antiepileptic drugs will continue.", 
    "47": "Procedures for identifying novel antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are changing and need to change more. Widespread reliance on two primary screens has led to the identification of novel compounds that resemble either phenytoin (suppressing high-frequency repetitive firing in cultured neurons and prolonging inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels identified by the maximal electroshock test) or benzodiazepines (potentiating the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), identified by the threshold pentylenetetrazol test). Advances in molecular neurobiology have identified specific molecular targets (subunits of ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and transporters) and have made them available in a form permitting high-throughput screening. AEDs can be designed to interact with specific sites on the target molecules. Alternatively, the molecular screens can be used to identify active components in natural products, including folk remedies. Preclinical in vivo screens can be improved by using animals with genetic or acquired epilepsies that have similar modifications in the properties of the target molecules as do human epilepsy syndromes. Future work is likely to define molecular targets for AEDs that will block or reverse chronic epileptogenesis.",

    "56": "Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is the object of intense interest because of recent developments in its treatment and aetiology. The actual definition of treatment-resistant schizophrenia is, however, still controversial. It should reflect the legitimate and varied needs and perspectives of people with schizophrenia, their family members, mental health care givers, mental health administrators, public health officials, and those who fund the direct and indirect costs of treating schizophrenia. The most common definition of treatment-resistant schizophrenia denotes patients with schizophrenia who, despite at least two adequate trials of classical neuroleptic drugs, have persistent moderate to severe positive, or disorganisation, or negative symptoms together with poor social and work function over a prolonged period of time. This definition reflects the viewpoint of people with this illness, their family members, and mental health care givers. Approximately 30% (range 10-45%) of schizophrenic patients meet these criteria. While this definition is adequate for many purposes, it should be realised that the remaining 70% of schizophrenic patients, whose positive symptoms respond adequately to neuroleptic treatment, may also have clinically significant negative symptoms, poor social and work function, clinically significant cognitive dysfunction, poor quality of life relative to the normal population, and constitute a significant burden to family and society. The lifetime suicide rate in both treatment-resistant and responsive schizophrenic patients is 9-13%, indicating that conventional definitions of neuroleptic response do not convey lower risk of suicide. However, before defining a patient as treatment resistant, it is important to consider whether the patient has received an inadequate duration of treatment, and/or too low, or possibly too high, doses of neuroleptic drugs. Using these stringent criteria, treatment resistance may be present at the time of initial diagnosis and treatment, but if not present initially, it will usually develop subsequently-sometimes not until after multiple acute exacerbations over a period of years. During the first months and years after the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been made, clinicians should be especially alert in identifying a patient as treatment resistant in order to diminish the severe social disability and suicidality which may ensue if it is not recognised and correctly treated. Once present, treatment resistance is usually permanent. However, some treatment-resistant patients may again become responsive to treatment or undergo spontaneous remission of positive symptoms in later life. The treatment of patients with schizophrenia who are treatment resistant is generally much more expensive that that of neuroleptic-responsive patients because their symptomatology and disturbed behaviour leads to more frequent and longer duration hospitalisations. Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia may manifest one or more of the classical subtypes of schizophrenia which may differ biologically in terms of neurochemistry and structural brain abnormalities, e.g. ventricular enlargement. They usually have poorer premorbid function, an earlier age at onset of positive symptoms, are more likely to be male than female, and may have various quantitative types of cortical or ventricular abnormalities evident with computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. There are no established qualitative differences in cognitive dysfunction between the two groups of patients with schizophrenia, but cognitive impairment is more severe in treatment-resistant patients. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia does not usually respond to increased dosages of neuroleptic drugs, switching to other types of neuroleptics, or adding adjunctive agents such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or lithium carbonate.

Rats were assigned randomly to control (C), sprint-trained (S), or endurance-trained (E) groups. Training was of 12 weeks duration.

Exercise reduced TBM (p < 0.05); increased the relative BM of the TA (E = 2.02 +/- 0.02, p < 0.01) and Plt (E = 1.15 +/- 0.02, p < 0.01; S = 1.13 +/- 0.03, p < 0.01), as well as the Ca++ uptake of the Sol SR (C = 0.08 +/- 0.02, E = 0.16 +/- 01, p < 0.05). MPY was elevated in S-Sol (C = 1.12 +/- 0.6, S = 1.52 +/- 0.1, p < 0.01). D elevated Sol MPY as well as TA PFK. S-trained animals had lower mean fibre areas than the E-trained (D-treated and untreated) animals. The elevated relative masses of TA and Plt are explained by a decreased TBM with exercise. The increased Ca++ uptake of the Sol indicates that E enhances this function, and the increased MPY probably implies an increased SR. The D could be responsible for the D-elevated Sol MPY as well as the TA PFK. El D did not reduce neuromuscular activity to a level adversely affecting oxidative enzyme activity, but in the case of PFK activity in the TA muscle, such a reduction was evident.", 
    "58": "We measured the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs), a marker of gliosis, in 26 brain areas (cerebral cortex, thalamus and extrapyramidal system) of the postmortem brains of 13 chronic schizophrenics and 10 controls, using [3H] PK 11195 as a ligand for the receptor assay. The specific [3H] PK 11195 binding was significantly decreased in three brain areas (superior parietal cortex, primary visual area and putamen) of schizophrenics, although there were no changes in the binding in the other brain areas. Scatchard analysis revealed that there were decreases in both the Bmax and Kd of [3H] PK 11195 binding in the brain areas. These results were almost in accordance with a number of neuropathological studies reporting that there was no change or reduction in glial cells in the brain regions of schizophrenics and suggested that the decreased density of PBRs in the brain may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, associated with reduced production of neurosteroids coupled to PBRs.", 
    "59": "The in vivo effect of sertraline on oxidative drug metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A was assessed by coadministration with alprazolam, carbamazepine, and terfenadine in three separate studies. Sertraline at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day for 10 to 20 days did not alter the pharmacokinetics of these CYP3A substrates/drugs.", 
    "60": "Midazolam is increasingly being used for oral sedation in pediatric dentistry. Unfortunately, it is available only as a parenteral formulation in Canada and the United States. Preparation of the parenteral solution for oral use is not uniform and leads the clinician to question the stability of this drug when used in conjunction with these vehicles. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the chemical stability of parenteral midazolam as an oral formulation to determine its expiry date. This was evaluated using a validated stability-indicating liquid chromatographic method. Midazolam was diluted in orange-flavored syrup to yield concentrations of 0.35, 0.64, and 1.03 mg/ml and then stored at room temperature. Samples were drawn on each of 9 study days (0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 13, 21, and 102) and chromatographed. On each study day, solutions were inspected visually for changes in color, clarity, and appearance of particulate matter. Midazolam concentrations were considered within acceptable limits if they were not less than 90% of the initial concentration. Over the 102-day study period, there was no significant change in concentration in any of the solutions. On day 102, the remaining midazolam was within 7% of the day zero concentration. Therefore, these formulations of midazolam are stable at room temperature for a period of 102 days and would be suitable for clinical use.", 
    "61": "Twenty-four healthy subjects participated in a triple crossover study in which some of the widely used psychomotor tests were applied as indicators of psychomotor ability. Diazepam was administered in doses of 10 mg intravenously, 10 mg rectally, and 35 mg rectally. Plasma levels of diazepam and performance decrement in the Trieger dot test (DOT), the perceptual speed test (PST), the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), and continuous reaction time were measured up to 12 hr after administration. The psychomotor effects were quite similar after administration of 10 mg diazepam intravenously and rectally. When the 35-mg rectal administration was compared to the 10-mg administrations, performance was still affected at 12 hr.", 
    "62": "Forty-six American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I and II adults were randomly assigned to one to two study groups. Each subject received 0.7 microgram/kg of fentanyl and a titrated dose of midazolam. One group received 100% supplemental oxygen (O2) while another group received 50% nitrous oxide (N2O) and 50% O2. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and O2 saturation (SpO2) were measured at 5-min intervals throughout the procedure. We conclude that there was no significant difference in EtCO2 or O2 saturation between the two groups.", 
    "63": "Cysteamine has been known to stimulate gastric acid secretion and to induce duodenal ulcers in rats. We investigated the role of gastrin in cysteamine-induced acid hypersecretion in the perfused rat stomach. Intravenous infusion of cysteamine (75 mg/kg/h) resulted in a significant increase in acid secretion, which was accompanied by a marked increase in the plasma gastrin concentration. The cysteamine-induced increase in gastric acid secretion was completely blocked by i.v. injection of anti-gastrin rabbit serum (500 microliters). In addition, i.v. infusion of a CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist (L-365,260) (1 mg/kg/h) also suppressed the cysteamine-induced increase in acid secretion. Atropine significantly, but only partially, inhibited the increase. The elevated plasma gastrin levels induced by cysteamine were unaffected by atropine and L-365,260. In conclusion, cysteamine-induced acid hypersecretion is mediated mainly by cysteamine-induced gastrin release and partially by cholinergic factors. Furthermore, gastrin release caused by cysteamine appears to be independent of cholinergic tone.", 
    "64": "Long-haul flights allow rapid crossing of times zones. When four time zones are crossed, the transmeridian flight induce jet-lag syndrome. Jet-lag is essentially composed of digestive and behavioural disturbances (insomnia and/or drowsiness). It is due to an immediate conflict between external time cues, which have been phase-advanced or phase-delayed by eastward or westward flight, respectively, and the endogenous clock. This conflict induces a desynchronization of the biological rhythms. Different counter-measures could be advised, but the most used is the pharmacological one. Hypnotics like benzodiazepines, cyclopyrones or imidazopyridines induce a recovery sleep but could also induce secondary effects in case of chronic use. Melatonin secreted by pineal gland needs more studies before a safety use for jet-lag treatment. Psychostimulants are able to induce a prolonged wakefulness. But amphetamine-like substances have to be forbidden because of the importance of side effects. New researches are studying a new galenic form of caffeine: the time release caffeine, which permits to induce a long and good quality wakefulness.", 
    "65": "An analysis of the files collected in the National Poison Information Centre reveals that drugs are the most frequent causes of acute poisonings (followed by pesticides and other chemical substances) not only in big cities but also in rural areas. Within the drug poisoning category, about 59% of the toxicological advice related to poisonings in children up to 14 years of age. The most frequent poisonings with drugs related to poisonings with sedative and psychotropic drugs, particularly those containing benzodiazepines, phenothiazine derivatives and tricyclic antidepressants. There were frequent inquiries relating to poisonings with drug mixtures. Self-poisonings were the most frequent cause of poisonings among the adults (87.3%), in children below 14 years of age dominated accidental poisonings (96% of all drug poisonings in children).",

    "67": "Information which, based on personal clinical experience and published research, may impact on compliance was collected for patients by way of a chart review within 3 days of hospital admission, a search of patient computerised hospital records and an interview. All crude data were coded and entered into a computerised relational database. Each patient's data were assessed using the Naranjo algorithm and the score was recorded. Chi-square analysis highlighted those factors which significantly influenced compliance, sub-divided into under-compliance (taking less medicine than prescribed) and over-compliance (taking more medicine than prescribed). Inter-relationships between variables were investigated using multiple-regression analysis.", 
    "68": "Overall, 13.7% of the population (n = 512) reported non-compliance, with 10.7% reporting under-compliance and 4.3% reporting over-compliance. A number of patients reported both under- and over-compliance. Being prescribed bronchodilators, for example, was found to be associated with under-compliance, while being prescribed analgesics (excluding non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) was associated with over-compliance using Chi-square analysis. A five-variable non-compliance risk model was obtained from logistic regression analysis. This model had a specificity of 88.9% and a sensitivity of 33.3%. The factors shown to influence compliance were the type of drug being taken (diuretics, bronchodilators and benzodiazepines), independence when taking medicines and the number of non-prescription drugs being taken. All other laboratory/test data, diseases/diagnoses, reasons for hospital admission and socio-demographic factors were not significant risk factors for self-reported non-compliance in the present model.", 
    "69": "Although it is accepted that self-reporting of poor compliance is generally lower than actual poor compliance, the present risk model provides further insight into the drug-taking habits of elderly patients.", 
    "70": "In the present study, the actions of several compounds with different intrinsic activities and BDZ receptor selectivity were examined in two well established animal models of anxiety: the open field test (OFT) and Vogel's punished drinking text (VT). Full agonists at the BDZ GABAA receptor (midazolam and diazepam) showed anxiolytic-like effects in both tests; however, the doses necessary to disinhibit animal behavior controlled by fear were higher in the VT than in the OFT. None of the partial BDZ receptor agonists studied (bretazenil, Ro 19-8022 and abecarnil) diminished neophobia-like behavior of rats in the OFT, and their sedative influence on gross behavior prevailed. On the other hand, all three drugs produced a clear-cut anxiolytic effect in the VT. A selective BDZ, receptor subtype full agonist (zolpidem) had a similar profile of action to that of partial agonists with an even stronger sedative effect in the OFT. Alpidem (a selective BDZ1 receptor partial agonist) did not reveal any anxiolytic action in either test. Flumazenil (an antagonist at the BDZ-GABAA receptors) also produced no effect in the OFT, or the VT. An inverse BDZ receptor agonist, beta-carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester (beta-CCM), evoked an anxiogenic-like response in the OFT, but not in the VT. In summary, it appeared that partial agonists and selective ligands at BDZ1 receptors revealed less advantageous anxiolytic-like action than did full allosteric GABAA receptor modulators. This study also indicates the test dependent profiles of action of BDZ-GABAA receptor ligands. It also indirectly suggests a different neurobiological background underlying the applied tests.", 
    "71": "The aim of this single-blind study was to evaluate the residual effects of a 10-mg dose of diazepam on cortical activation 11 h after oral intake. The electroencephalographic segments (from O1-O2) delimited by a sequence of photic stimuli presented every 10 sec during a simple reaction-time task (36 min duration) were arbitrarily classified into nine cerebral patterns (EEGP). EEGP segment classifications were grouped into six peri-stimulus transitions expressed in percentages: alpha-blockade; alpha-persistence; beta-persistence; alpha-induction; activation and deactivation. A sample of 42 young healthy university students (21 females and 21 males) each underwent three counterbalanced experimental conditions (control, placebo and diazepam). Diazepam affected all the subjects, although the women showed a greater number of EEGP transitions which indicated deactivation, than did the men. The results show that this type of visual EEG analysis is a useful technique for detecting the residual effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "72": "Computerized symbol-digit substitution tests (SDSTs) and 'yes/no' digit-symbol substitution tests (YNDSTs), together with a digit-digit copying test (DDCT) were compared in a double-blind crossover study for hypnosedative and alcohol effects in 12 young healthy subjects. The tests were carried out before and 1, 3.5 and 5 h after intake of 15 mg diazepam, 30 mg oxazepam, 7.5 mg zopiclone, 15 mg zolpidem or 0.65+0.35 g/kg ethanol, these impaired performance by varying extents. The drug-induced decrements were similar in the YNDSTs and SDSTs; the errors were subject-related and increased with alcohol intake in the YNDSTs but not in the SDSTs. Pooled baseline values in YNDSTs correlated well (Pearson) with those in the SDSTs. The SDSTs also correlated well with the DDCTs. The same correlations were seen when comparing absolute performances after ethanol and hypnosedatives. When using the delta-values (changes from baseline), the correlation between YNDSTs and SDSTs was high after placebo but low after alcohol and hypnosedatives. When using ANCOVA to measure the responses to drugs (delta-drug-delta-placebo), the correlation between YNDSTs and SDSTs was fairly significant after most but not all active drugs. Subjective visual analogue variables did not correlate with objective performances. By comparing absolute performances with hypnosedatives we conclude that YNDSTs and SDSTs are similar, with the delta-values indicating differences between them.", 
    "73": "Methods for the synthesis of each of the four stereoisomers of 6-(3-propylthio-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oc tane (10, 11, 12, and 13) and 3-(3-propylthio-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]he ptane (18, 19, 20, and 21), and the two stereoisomers of 3-(3-propylthio-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oc tane (27 and 28) were developed. The relative configuration of the compounds was determined on the basis of previously described 1H NOE experiments, and the absolute configuration of 6-(3-propylthio-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oc tanes (10, 11, 12, and 13) and 3-(3-propylthio-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oc tane (27 and 28) was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Optical purity was determined by capillary electrophoresis (CE) using chiral selectors as trimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and heparin dissolved in the running buffer. All the 3-(3-propylthio-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1-azabicycles had low nanomolar affinity for muscarinic receptors as determined by displacement of radiolabelled oxotremorine-M (3H-Oxo-M) and pirenzepine (3H-Pz) from cortical rat brain homogenates. The binding assay discriminated between diastereomers, but only a minor degree of enantioselectivity was observed in the binding assays.", 
    "74": "Patients with head injury need effective help. The restoration of disturbed ventilation and an impaired general circulation is important. Concomitant injuries, which occur in about 40% of cases, should be recognized. Priority must be given to treating large lesions of vital organs. Hypoxia and hypotension should be avoided because they produce secondary brain damage. Unconscious patients are intubated and ventilated. In a few cases a laryngeal mask could be applied. Intravenous hypnotics, narcotics and benzodiazepines are used. Inhalational anesthetics, among them N2O, are harmful and should be avoided in these cases. The patients are given normal volumes of colloid fluids or water electrolyte solutions. A long-lasting muscle relaxation will impede clinical assessment. Cerebral protection and effective drug treatment of the lesions is still under debate: Nimodepine in traumatic SAH and glucosteroids in local lesions with BBB rupture, however, seem to be effective.", 
    "75": "Antidepressants are frequently prescribed to treat panic disorder. Although tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors both block panic attacks, they have many adverse effects such as orthostatic hypotension and weight gain. High potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam are also efficacious but carry the risk of physical dependency. Data from research trials as well as clinical experience are accumulating to indicate that the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)--fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline--and perhaps venlafaxine, which inhibits both serotonergic and noradrenergic reuptake, are useful antipanic medications. The possibility also exists that these newer antidepressants such as SSRIs and venlafaxine are superior in effectiveness to the previously available drugs and, when combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy, might provide the best treatment outcome for patients with panic disorder.", 
    "76": "The treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has changed dramatically in the last 10 years. Currently, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the \"first choice\" agents for pharmacologic treatment of OCD, although few head-to-head comparisons exist between any two specific agents. Strategies for nonresponders and partial responders to the SRI/SSRIs are reviewed. The only agents that have shown significant improvement as augmenting agents to an SRI/SSRI in systematic trials have been clonazepam and haloperidol. Predictors of response to pharmacotherapy have been limited, but several reports have found that an early age at onset of OCD has been associated with a poorer response to medications. Long-term maintenance medication may be necessary for some, although behavioral therapy may improve the need for extended pharmacotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, specifically exposure with response prevention, still remains an effective and important component of treatment for many. One of the newest developments is the identification of a pediatric subtype of OCD characterized by prepubertal acute onset after group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Investigation trials with these children include immunomodulatory therapies and penicillin treatment and prophylaxis. If a unique subgroup of children with OCD can be identified, then novel treatments may prove effective and have a role in long-term prophylaxis.", 
    "77": "The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of caffeine and the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam, and a combination of both on beta-endorphin (beta-EN) levels in specific rat brain regions. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) adapted to a 12-hour light: 12-hour dark illumination cycle were used in this study. Caffeine (10 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg) or a combination of caffeine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to rats at 11:00 hr. Control animals were injected with saline. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation 1 h after injection, the brains were immediately removed; the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and midbrain were dissected and their B-EN levels measured by radioimmunoassay. Caffeine administration significantly increased B-EN levels in the cortex. Similarly, administration of diazepam alone resulted in a significant increase of B-EN levels in cortex. However, concurrent administration of diazepam and caffeine resulted in higher increase of B-EN levels in cortex. No significant changes in B-EN levels were detected in hippocampus and midbrain after administration of either caffeine or diazepam alone. On the other hand, when diazepam and caffeine were concurrently administered a significant increase of B-EN levels were observed in the midbrain. Moreover, administration of diazepam alone resulted in a significant increase of B-EN levels in hypothalamus. This increase was still observed following concurrent administration of diazepam and caffeine. These results clearly indicate that diazepam alters caffeine-induced effects on B-EN in specific rat brain regions.", 
    "78": "The possibility that diazepam will influence spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEP), edema formation and cell changes following spinal cord injury (SCI) was examined in a rat model. The SCI was produced in equithesin anaesthetised animals by making a longitudinal incision (about 2 mm deep and 5 mm long) in the right dorsal horn of the T10-11 segments. The SCEP were recorded from the epidural space of the T9 segment after stimulation of the right tibial and sural nerves. The SCEP consisted of a small positive peak followed by a broad and high negative peak. Infliction of trauma to the rats resulted in an immediate and pronounced decrease of the maximal negative peak (MNP) amplitude. The spinal cord edema and cell changes were markedly pronounced 5 h after injury. Pretreatment with diazepam attenuated the early SCEP changes induced by the trauma and reduced the later development of edema and cell injury. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors are involved in trauma induced alterations in SCEP changes, edema formation and cell injury, not reported earlier.", 
    "79": "Cerebrovascular damages leading to subsequent reductions in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) may play an important role in secondary cell damages following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent studies have demonstrated that rCBF markedly decrease in experimental model of TBI (e.g. fluid percussion injury, acute subdural hematoma, contusion). However, precise mechanisms underlying post-traumatic CBF reduction remain unclear. In the present study, the rCBF changes and microthrombosis formation were investigated in a cortical contusional model in rats, and the effects of etizolam (platelet activating factor antagonist) on microthrombosis were tested. The rCBF in the peripheral areas increased transiently, and decreased to ischemic level 3 hours post- injury. The histological examinations revealed microthrombosis formation in the contused area, extending from the center to the peripheral areas within 6 hours post-injury. The rCBF decrease and the contusion necrosis volume were significantly attenuated by etizolam administration. These results indicate that platelet activating factor is involved in microthrombosis formation and hemodynamic depression, and resultant ischemic damages within areas surrounding the contusion.", 
    "80": "Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) and the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site (PBR) share a close physical proximity to each other in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, MAO activity and the density of PBR sites are affected by stress; benzodiazepines may influence stress-induced changes in MAO activity. In view of the close physical association between MAO and the PBR, we examined the effects of chronic administration of selective and nonselective MAO inhibitors to mice on the specific binding of 3H-Ro5-4864 and 3H-PK-11195 to crude membranes prepared from kidney, heart and liver. Chronic MAO inhibition was associated with alterations in PBR binding in all three tissues; however, in heart and liver changes were not detectable with 3H-PK-11195. Perhaps, the ability to discern changes with 3H-Ro5-4864 that are not detectable with 3H-PK-11195 reflects a functional change in the \"activity\" of the PBR site in heart and liver that is elicited by chronic MAO inhibition and mediated by a change in the \"conformation\" of the protein that is detected with 3H-Ro5-4864. Importantly, iproniazid, the nonselective MAO inhibitor, caused changes in PBR binding in all three of the tissues.", 
    "81": "Fifty-two subjects with panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were interviewed 12-18 months after they completed an acute treatment study (9-11 weeks) with alprazolam followed by blind and controlled drug discontinuation. Patients were questioned about the severity of their anxiety disorder and degree of functional impairment at the time of follow-up, as well as about their subjective experience as participants in a clinical trial. At the time of follow-up 78% of the patients reported none or minimal anxiety symptoms and 89% had none or only minimal functional deficit, as compared to 100% reporting moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 57% reporting significant functional deficit before entering the study. Overall, patients felt that the participation in the study was a very positive and beneficial experience and 64% said they would not hesitate to participate in a clinical trial in the future.", 
    "82": "EEG effects of zopiclone (7.5 mg), a cyclopyrrolone derivative with hypnotic action, were compared with effects of diazepam (10 mg). Multichannel EEG recordings, double-blind crossover trials with placebo, and oral single doses were used in healthy volunteers. Vigilance-controlled EEG before and after zopiclone (and placebo), and before and after diazepam (and placebo) were analyzed into FFT power spectra. Effects were assessed as placebo-referred pre-post-medication power differences in four frequency bands. Overall statistics showed significant (P < 0.007) global differences between medication effects in the delta frequency band (0.5-3.5 Hz). After zopiclone, fronto-central delta increased bilaterally, whereas after diazepam delta decreased over centro-parietal to right temporo-occipital regions. These spatially different brain electric effects show that different neuronal populations must have become active in response to zopiclone and diazepam.", 
    "83": "Sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges are thought to originate from the same thalamic pacemaker. In the present work it is investigated whether sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges are also sensitive for the same drugs. Adult male WAG/Rij rats were chronically implanted with frontal and occipital EEG electrode pairs. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with clonidine (0.00625 mg/kg), phenobarbital (20 mg/kg), flunitrazepam (0.188 mg/kg). Frontal and occipital sleep spindles and mainly frontal spike-wave discharges were seen in the electroencephalogram. Phenobarbital and flunitrazepam reduced the number of spike-wave discharges and enhanced frontal sleep spindles, while clonidine facilitated spike-wave discharges and reduced frontal sleep spindles. The results of these three drugs indicate a reciprocal relationship between the number of frontal sleep spindles and the number of spike-wave discharges. Only clonidine facilitated occipital sleep spindles without an effect on spike-wave discharges. It can be concluded that frontal and occipital sleep spindles have a different pharmacological profile. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between frontal sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges may suggest that sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges are controlled by a single controlling system. However, in order to explain the clonidine data on occipital sleep spindles another factor must be incorporated in properties of the mechanism(s) involved in EEG oscillations.", 
    "84": "Administration of a bolus dose of mCPP, a 5-HT2C receptor agonist, to rats provokes endocrine and behavioural effects that are reminiscent of some of the symptoms of human depression. Rats exposed to chronic mild stress (which is also a key factor in the precipitation of human depression) were hypersensitive to mCPP, whilst chronic treatment with antidepressant serotonin re-uptake inhibitors suppressed the responsiveness to mCPP. Similarities also exist with respect to withdrawal reactions following chronic alcohol or benzodiazepine abuse. In humans, a bolus dose of mCPP can cause alcohol craving (in abstinent alcoholics) and migraine (in susceptible persons), suggesting that there is a 5-HT2C receptor hyperresponsiveness in these conditions also. It is hypothesized that chronic treatment with SSRI's can prevent migraine attacks and drug craving.", 
    "85": "Binding of ibuprofen (IB) enantiomers to human serum albumin (HSA) was studied using a chiral fluorescent derivatizing reagent, which enabled the measurement of IB enantiomers at a concentration as low 5 x 10(-8) M. Scatchard analyses revealed that there were two classes of binding sites for both enantiomers. For the high affinity site, the number of the binding sites was one for both enantiomers, and the binding constant of R-IB was 2.3-fold greater than that of S-IB. The difference in the affinity at the high affinity site may result in the stereoselective binding of IB enantiomers at therapeutic concentrations. It was confirmed that the high affinity site of IB enantiomers is Site II (diazepam binding site) by using site marker ligands. Also, significant enantiomer-enantiomer interactions were observed in the binding. The binding data were quantitatively analyzed and a binding model with an assumption of competitive interactions only at the high affinity site simulated the binding characteristics of IB enantiomers fairly well.",

    "87": "Emergency physicians are well versed in the recognition and management of certain poisonings which present with characteristic toxidromes. We present a case of a young pharmacy student who presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, facial flushing, dilated pupils, and dry skin and mucous membranes presumably due to anticholinergic poisoning. She improved with a combination of benzodiazepines and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine. However, following resolution of her initial symptoms, she became ill again and the subsequent neurologic evaluation revealed a diencephalic lesion consistent with a viral encephalitis. The acute anticholinergic signs and symptoms resulted from this lesion in an area of large cholinergic outflow. Although recognition and management of her acute anticholinergic findings were appropriate, they were not the manifestations of an acute anticholinergic ingestion.", 
    "88": "The benzodiazepine analogue Ro 05-4864 [chlorodiazepam] (2.10[-5] to 4.10[-4] M) induced a concentration-dependent increase of coronary flow rate (Emax 82.4% [+/- 2.2 SEM]) and an increase of contraction force (Emax 68.3% [+/- 4.7 SEM]) of the retrograde perfused, isolated Langendorff rat heart. The influence of PK 11195, antagonist of the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor, and flumazenil (Anexate), antagonist of the central type benzodiazepine receptor, on these responses to Ro 5-4864 was studied. In concentrations of 10(-7) to 5.10(-5) M, PK 11195 significantly reduced both the increase of coronary flow rate and of contraction force, without affecting these functions by itself; the positive inotropic response produced by Ro 05-4864 was even abolished in the presence of 5.10(-5) M PK 11195. The Emax values of Ro 05-4864 on both coronary flow and inotropy were reduced significantly by PK 11195. In the presence of flumazenil, 10(-7) to 10(-5) M, both the vasodilatory and the positive inotropic response induced by Ro 05-4864 were significantly counteracted as well. The Emax values of Ro 05-4864 were reduced significantly. In conclusion, the results support earlier suggestions that it is tempting to involve peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors in cardiac actions of benzodiazepines. The finding that the centrally acting benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil reduced the cardiac actions of Ro 05-4864 is as yet difficult to explain. On the other hand concentrations of both agonist and antagonist employed are so-much high that interference of other receptors than benzodiazepine receptors must be considered as well.", 
    "89": "We studied the tolerability and efficacy of abecarnil, a new partial benzodiazepine agonist, for short-term relief of anxiety in geriatric patients. After a 1-week placebo lead-in, 182 outpatients (mean +/- SD age = 68.3 +/- 5.8; range, 59-85 years) were randomly assigned in a double-blind, parallel-group design to high-dosage abecarnil (7.5-17.5 mg daily), low-dosage abecarnil (3.0-7.0 mg daily), or placebo for 6 weeks of acute treatment followed by abrupt discontinuation and a 2-week follow-up. During the acute treatment period, the discontinuation rate from adverse events was greater for the group treated with high-dosage abecarnil (44%) than for the groups treated with low-dosage abecarnil (14%) or placebo (12%). The most frequently reported side effects associated with abecarnil were drowsiness and insomnia. For the acute treatment period, low-dosage abecarnil was superior to placebo in reducing anxiety at Weeks 2-4 and 6, and was statistically significantly superior to high-dosage abecarnil at Weeks 4-6. More than half of the placebo group showed at least moderate global improvement at Weeks 3 and 6. One week after abrupt discontinuation of abecarnil, the placebo-treated group had less anxiety than did both groups treated with high-dosage and low-dosage abecarnil. The most commonly reported symptoms of withdrawal were headache and insomnia. These data indicate that abecarnil, at dosages ranging from 3.0 to 7.0 mg daily, is better tolerated and more efficacious for the short-term treatment of anxiety in geriatric patients than are higher dosages of 7.5 to 17.5 mg daily. Abrupt discontinuation of abecarnil at either dosage range causes definite rebound symptoms within the first week after withdrawal. These data also suggest that treatment with placebo offers at least moderate relief of anxiety in many elderly patients.", 
    "90": "The development of effective and well-tolerated anxiolytic agents is an area of critical clinical importance. Abecarnil, a beta carboline, is a partial benzodiazepine-receptor agonist that has demonstrated promise as an anxiolytic agent. In this study, we examine the efficacy, safety, and discontinuation-related effects of abecarnil, buspirone, and placebo in the acute and long-term treatment of patients who have generalized anxiety disorder.", 
    "91": "This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two dosages of abecarnil and buspirone. In total, 464 patients were randomized. After a placebo run-in week, patients entered a 6-week double-blind treatment period, followed by an optional 18-week maintenance period for treatment responders. After abrupt discontinuation of the acute or maintenance treatment, patients entered a 3-week placebo-substitution follow-up period. Treatment response was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale.", 
    "92": "Compared with placebo, abecarnil showed significant anxiolytic activity early in the treatment period, particularly in the high-dosage group, though these differences did not maintain statistical significance at the end of the trial. Buspirone was associated with a slower onset of action and better symptom relief than placebo after 6 weeks of therapy. Withdrawal symptoms emerged in patients who abruptly discontinued abecarnil (particularly at the higher dosage) only in those receiving a longer duration of treatment.", 
    "93": "The results of this study need to be understood in the context of a high placebo-response rate, which hampers the ability to demonstrate significant drug-placebo differences. This study suggests that abecarnil may be an effective anxiolytic agent; further attention is warranted to assess its spectrum of clinical effectiveness.", 
    "94": "In a placebo-controlled, multicenter study, 180 male and female outpatients, ages 18-65, with DSM-III-R generalized anxiety disorder, were treated with abecarnil (a partial benzodiazepine agonist), alprazolam, or placebo for 4 weeks. This was followed by a rapid (1-week) taper, during which patients were assessed for any taper-related symptoms. All patients were identified via a structured clinical interview for DSM-III-R and randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups. More than 70% of each treatment group completed the study. In the acute-treatment phase, both abecarnil and alprazolam showed evidence for efficacy that was significantly better than that of placebo. Both active agents were tolerated well. After the swift taper, a significantly greater number of taper-related symptoms occurred in the alprazolam-treated group than in the abecarnil-treated group, which was not different than in the placebo-treated group. Additionally, less residual improvement followed the taper in the alprazolam-treated and the placebo-treated groups. These data indicate that the partial benzodiazepine agonist abecarnil may be useful as a safe, effective, short-term treatment for anxiety. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "95": "The mechanism by which high-fat diets potentiate pancreatic cancer is not known, but pancreaticotrophic hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK) may be involved. The effect of CCK receptor blockade on carcinogenesis during the entire promotion period was investigated in Syrian Golden hamsters fed a high- or low-fat diet and treated with N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (3 x 10 mg/kg at weekly intervals). One-half of the hamsters fed a high-fat diet received the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (25 nmol/kg/hr) for the duration of the experiment. At 39 weeks the incidence of pancreatic malignancies was significantly higher in hamsters fed the high-fat diet than in those fed the low-fat diet (p < 0.05). Tumor incidence was not changed by CCK receptor blockade. Potentiation of pancreatic cancer by a high-fat diet in hamsters does not appear to be influenced by endogenous CCK during the tumor promotion period.", 
    "96": "We studied the effects of lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, on differentiated emotions in healthy volunteers. In order to induce differentiated emotions, film excerpts were selected on the basis of the type of emotion they induced (fear, anger and for affective tone neutral film). For 6 days (D1 to D6), ten healthy volunteers received lorazepam (1 mg bid) or placebo in a randomized cross-over double-blind trial. During each treatment period, emotional induction occurred on D4, D5 and D6. One film excerpt (fear, anger or neutral) was presented each morning after relaxation. Evaluation was performed before and after each emotional induction and included questionnaires (Differential Emotions Scale and physical activation visual analog scales), and neurophysiological parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and norepinephrine levels). Globally, the film excerpts induced the predicted emotions. An analysis of variance was undertaken and revealed a significant effect of lorazepam versus placebo. On the Differential Emotions Scale and during fear induction, lorazepam induced a significantly higher increase in fear, anxiety and disgust emotions than placebo, whereas no effect was observed after anger induction. Lorazepam also induced a significantly higher increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure with no change in heart rate, and physical activation items (\"tears\" and \"faster breathing\") without no significant change in norepinephrine. In conclusion, our results are consistent with an overall increase in emotional reactivity with lorazepam (1 mg bid) as compared to placebo. The pertinence of film-induced differentiated emotions has to be confirmed for clinical pharmacological use.", 
    "97": "Recent experiments with primates have demonstrated that treatment with atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam, even if administered immediately after organophosphate exposure, does not totally prevent neuronal brain damage. Using primates, we have studied, for the first time, the ability of GK-11 (gacyclidine), an antiglutamatergic drug in the process of agreement for human use, given as an additional therapy, to counteract the neuropathology due to organophosphate exposure that persists after classical treatment with oxime/atropine/benzodiazepine. We have also examined the recovery of the organophosphate-intoxicated primates. Male Cynomolgus monkeys were pretreated 1 hour before poisoning with pyridostigmine, then intoxicated with 8 LD50 of soman and immediately treated with the combination pralidoxime/atropine/diazepam. Some of the animals also received GK-11 at 0.01; 0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.) 10 minutes after soman challenge. Recovery of the primates (reflexes, movements, feeding) and the neuropathological changes that occurred three weeks after intoxication (histological examinations and neuronal cell density measurement) were compared in GK-11-treated and control animals. At all doses tested, GK-11 prevented the neuronal rarefaction of the frontoparietal cortex that was observed in soman-intoxicated animals that received only oxime/atropine/diazepam. Moreover, the 0.01 mg/kg dose of GK-11 improved the early recovery of intoxicated primates from 1 day after intoxication. In the view of the most effective management of organophosphate intoxication that is currently available, GK-11 thus appears to be a promising additional neuroprotective therapy. This drug is presently being evaluated in a human clinical trial for a different neuroprotective indication.", 
    "98": "We investigated the effect of diazepam on memory of 30 days-old and 60-70 days-old female Wistar rats, using two behavioral tasks: step-down inhibitory avoidance (IA) and shuttle avoidance (SA). Diazepam (0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) or its vehicle were given i.p., 60 min prior to the training session. Training-test interval was 24 h. Diazepam impaired the retention of IA in 30 days-old rats at the three doses used, while retention of SA was not impaired by any dose. In the 60-70 days-old animals, diazepam at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg was facilitatory in IA and had no effect on SA, while doses of 1.0 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg impaired retention of both tasks. We suggest that these age-dependent effects of diazepam on memory of IA and SA could be related to developmental changes in brain GABAA receptors."
