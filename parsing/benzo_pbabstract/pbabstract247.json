    "1": "The study population consisted of 13 patients scheduled to receive two quadrants of periodontal surgery at two different appointments. A randomized split-mouth crossover design was used with one quadrant of surgery involving preoperative oral sedation (diazepam) and local anesthetic, and the second using local anesthetic only. Oxygen saturation was monitored by pulse oximetry, which recorded the number of times saturation dropped below 95% in a given time period. Data were recorded at 5 time periods: 1) baseline; 2) from time of anesthetic administration to 20 minutes into surgery; 3) 21 to 40 minutes; 4) 41 to 60 minutes; and 5) 61 to 80 minutes into the surgery. Data were analyzed by a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA. The two within-group factors were treatment group and time.", 
    "2": "Results indicated no significant interaction between time and treatment (P > .05). However, data for groups over time suggested a trend supporting an interaction. The eta2 value of 0.124 suggested a moderate effect favoring the diazepam treatment. No significant difference was noted for the main effect of treatment and time. However, the eta2 value of 0.24 for treatment effect (diazepam versus no diazepam) suggested a meaningful difference between groups. Similarly the eta2 value of 0.135 for time suggested a moderate effect over time within-subjects.",

    "4": "The synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of new derivatives of 2-substituted 5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepines, structurally related to tifluadom (5), are reported. Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.", 
    "5": "Integrative brain failure is often a comorbidity of critical illness, and although not uncommon, is perhaps the least understood of all the various organ failure phenomena. Factors that contribute to integrative brain failure include inadequate management of pain, stress, anxiety, and the several underlying mechanisms that create agitation in the intensive care unit patient. Delirium, a resultant organic mental syndrome, is reversible when promptly recognized and aggressively managed. The nurse who is astute in clinical assessments and skillful in the management of the environment of care can prevent and control states of anxiety, irritability, restlessness, and sleep disturbances that contribute to the development of delirium.", 
    "6": "Sleep deprivation is a significant problem for patients in critical care units. Sleep is a complex, active process that is divided into 4 stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Noise, lights, discomfort, pain, medications, and stress all contribute to a patient's inability to sleep. Lack of knowledge about the sleep stages, nursing routines, and frequent nursing assessment and interventions also impact the critically ill patient's ability to sleep. Education about sleep deprivation needs to be integrated into critical care courses and orientation programs. Sleep deprivation should be addressed on the multidisciplinary care plan and in health team conference, and nursing care planned accordingly. Sleep medications and their effects should be evaluated for each patient, as well as identifying medications that might be preventing or disturbing sleep.", 
    "7": "Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) using propofol and alfentanil provides effective sedation for colonoscopy, with the advantage of a shorter recovery time in comparison with diazepam and pethidine. However, most endoscopy units in the United Kingdom are currently using midazolam (a shorter-acting benzodiazepine) as a sedative agent. This study compares the efficacy of sedation and recovery times between PCS and a combination of midazolam and pethidine.", 
    "8": "Sixty-seven patients undergoing colonoscopy were randomly assigned prospectively to receive sedation with either PCS, using propofol and alfentanil, or a bolus of midazolam and pethidine. Sedation and pain scores were recorded during the procedure by one specialist nurse. Patients' recollection of pain was recorded after the procedure. Recovery was assessed using number connection tests. The impact on subsequent activities and the level of amnesia, as well as overall satisfaction, were established by telephone call after 24 h.", 
    "9": "The sedation method had no impact on the success, difficulty, or duration of the colonoscopy. PCS could be set up by the specialist nurse without affecting the time between cases. Patients in the PCS group recovered significantly faster (median 5 min vs 35 min; P < 0.0001) and left the department more quickly (median 40 min vs 75 min; P < 0.0001). Patients in the PCS group had significantly higher pain scores and significantly more recall than those in the midazolam and pethidine group.

    "11": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified as a possible early event in ischemia-reperfusion damage. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, has already been proposed to play a role in mitochondrial regulation, although its exact function remains unclear. The aim of this work was to determine the role of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in ischemia-reperfusion injury and to test the potential beneficial effect of a novel potent peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, 7-chloro-N,N,5-trimethyl-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,5-dihydro-4H-pyridazino[4,5-b]indole-1-acetamide (SSR180575). To characterize and link the mitochondrial, cellular, and cardiac consequences of ischemia-reperfusion, we examined the effects of SSR180575 in several in vitro and in vivo models of oxidative stress. Hydrogen peroxide decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced oxidative phosphorylation capacities, and caused cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. SSR180575 (100 nM-1 microM) prevented all these effects. In perfused rat hearts, SSR180575 administered in vitro (100 nM-1 microM) or by oral pretreatment (3-30 mg/kg) greatly reduced the contractile dysfunction associated with ischemia-reperfusion. Furthermore, in anesthetized rats, SSR180575 (3-30 mg/kg p.o.) produced significant reductions in infarct size after coronary artery occlusion/reperfusion. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor play a major role in the regulation of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury and that SSR180575, a novel peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, is of potential interest in these indications.", 
    "12": "Fear is an adaptive component of the acute \"stress\" response to potentially-dangerous (external and internal) stimuli which threaten to perturb homeostasis. However, when disproportional in intensity, chronic and/or irreversible, or not associated with any genuine risk, it may be symptomatic of a debilitating anxious state: for example, social phobia, panic attacks or generalized anxiety disorder. In view of the importance of guaranteeing an appropriate emotional response to aversive events, it is not surprising that a diversity of mechanisms are involved in the induction and inhibition of anxious states. Apart from conventional neurotransmitters, such as monoamines, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, many other modulators have been implicated, including: adenosine, cannabinoids, numerous neuropeptides, hormones, neurotrophins, cytokines and several cellular mediators. Accordingly, though benzodiazepines (which reinforce transmission at GABA(A) receptors), serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonists and 5-HT reuptake inhibitors are currently the principle drugs employed in the management of anxiety disorders, there is considerable scope for the development of alternative therapies. In addition to cellular, anatomical and neurochemical strategies, behavioral models are indispensable for the characterization of anxious states and their modulation. Amongst diverse paradigms, conflict procedures--in which subjects experience opposing impulses of desire and fear--are of especial conceptual and therapeutic pertinence. For example, in the Vogel Conflict Test (VCT), the ability of drugs to release punishment-suppressed drinking behavior is evaluated. In reviewing the neurobiology of anxious states, the present article focuses in particular upon: the multifarious and complex roles of individual modulators, often as a function of the specific receptor type and neuronal substrate involved in their actions; novel targets for the management of anxiety disorders; the influence of neurotransmitters and other agents upon performance in the VCT; data acquired from complementary pharmacological and genetic strategies and, finally, several open questions likely to orientate future experimental- and clinical-research. In view of the recent proliferation of mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis, modulation and, potentially, treatment of anxiety disorders, this is an opportune moment to survey their functional and pathophysiological significance, and to assess their influence upon performance in the VCT and other models of potential anxiolytic properties.", 
    "13": "Previous studies have indicated that conventional description of drug/cyclodextrin complexes in aqueous solutions as inclusion complexes are not as unambiguous as one might think. It has been shown that in some cases drug/cyclodextrin complexes consist of a mixture of inclusion and non-inclusion complexes. Furthermore it has been shown that drug/cyclodextrin complexes can form aggregates containing up to couple of hundred complexes. In this present study beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) solubilization of hydrocortisone is enhanced by including short-chain anionic and cationic species in the aqueous complexation medium. For example, maximum hydrocortisone solubility in pure aqueous betaCD solutions or suspensions is 2.2 mg/ml. Addition of 1% (w/v) sodium acetate to the complexation medium increases this value to 7.1 mg/ml (or over 220%). Further addition of 0.25% (w/v) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose to the medium increased the hydrocortisone solubility to over 9 mg/ml. Similar results were obtained when sodium salicylate or benzalkonium chloride were added to the complexation medium. It is also shown that cyclodextrin complexes of lipophilic compounds that have good affinity for the cyclodextrin cavity can be used to enhance cyclodextrin solubilization of drugs that have low affinity for the cavity. All these observations can be explained by formation of drug/cyclodextrin complex aggregates.", 
    "14": "In this study, we propose a new three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) method for selecting bioactive conformations and alignment rule simultaneously. The possible conformations of all molecules are generated by conformational analysis and they are superimposed on template conformer with possible alignment rules. The field variables are calculated as 3D descriptor of structures. Four-way partial least-squares (PLS) analysis is applied, and the conformations and alignment rule largely contributing to biological activity are selected. In order to demonstrate this method, the data set of benzodiazepine derivatives, antagonists of (CCK-B), was used as a test sample. As a result, appropriate conformers and alignment rule were selected and significant PLS model was obtained. The resulting final model could give the reasonable 3D coefficient contour maps. Moreover, external prediction was carried out by use of external data sample and its prediction was proved to be high enough.",

Categorical analysis of Simpson-Angus Scale scores showed significantly more haloperidol- (p <.001) or risperidone-treated patients (p =.004) developed parkinsonism than did olanzapine-treated patients. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced significantly greater reductions in Simpson-Angus Scale scores than did haloperidol- (p <.001), risperidone- (p <.001), or clozapine-treated (p =.032) patients.

The effects were assessed in the writhing test and pentetrazole-induced seizures, respectively. The antinociceptive effects of the threshold doses of diazepam (1 mg/kg) and clonazepam (0.0375 mg/kg) were significantly increased by TRIM (7.5 mg/kg) but not by 3-Br-7-NI (10 mg/kg). L-arginine (125 mg/kg) was able to reverse the effects produced by co-administration of TRIM (7.5 mg/kg) with diazepam (1 mg/kg), and also of TRIM (7.5 mg/kg) with clonazepam (0.0375 mg/kg). Protective efficacy of the threshold dose (0.05 mg/kg) of diazepam against pentetrazole-induced tonic convulsions and death was significantly increased by TRIM (25 mg/kg) but not by 3-Br-7-NI (10 and 100 mg/kg). TRIM (25 mg/kg) intensified the protective efficacy of the threshold dose (0.005 mg/kg) of clonazepam, but the effect was not reversed by L-arginine (125 mg/kg). The present results seem to confirm, at least partly, participation of NO in antinociceptive and anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines, and point to TRIM as a better tool than 3-Br-7NI for examination of the role of NO in behavioral studies.", 
    "25": "The influence of nitric oxide (NO) on anticonvulsant activity of diazepam and clonazepam was examined in the pentetrazole- and electroshock-induced seizure models in mice. Protective efficacy of the threshold dose of diazepam against pentetrazole-induced clonic and tonic seizures, and death was significantly increased by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) while 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) was slightly less effective. The above intensifying effect of L-NAME on antiepileptic activity of diazepam was reversed by L-arginine, a substrate for NO formation, but not by D-arginine. Methylene blue, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor, increased the protective efficacy of diazepam and clonazepam in the pentetrazole-induced seizures. 7-NI was able to potentiate the protective efficacy of diazepam and clonazepam in electroshock-induced tonic hindlimb extension. These findings suggest that the cGMP/NO system may participate in antiepileptic effects of benzodiazepines.",

Mild hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been documented from the use of these medications, but the range of effects on metabolism and the effects on skin are poorly characterized. OBSERVETION: We describe 3 patients who developed eruptive xanthomas, 1 of whom had relative insulin insufficiency, after starting olanzapine therapy. These cases further support the association of severe dyslipidemia with olanzapine use in selected patients.",

    "28": "Status epilepticus is an increasingly recognized public health problem in the United States. Status epilepticus is associated with a high mortality rate that is largely contingent on the duration of the condition before initial treatment, the etiology of the condition, and the age of the patient. Treatment is evolving as new medications become available. Three new preparations--fosphenytoin, rectal diazepam, and parenteral valproate--have implications for the management of status epilepticus. However, randomized controlled trials show that benzodiazepines (in particular, diazepam and lorazepam) should be the initial drug therapy in patients with status epilepticus. Despite the paucity of clinical trials comparing medication regimens for acute seizures, there is broad consensus that immediate diagnosis and treatment are necessary to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this condition. Moreover, investigators have reported that status epilepticus often is not considered in patients with altered consciousness in the intensive care setting. In patients with persistent alteration of consciousness for which there is no clear etiology, physicians should be more quickly prepared to obtain electroencephalography to identify status epilepticus. Physicians should rely on a standardized protocol for management of status epilepticus to improve care for this neurologic emergency.",

The main fraction of the total radioactivity (approximately 80%) was eliminated within approximately 84 h upon intravenous injection and within approximately 360 h after transdermal introduction. In the latter case, the ratio of lipophilic and hydrophilic metabolites is modified as well: the former fraction increases by a factor of 1.75, while the latter decreases by a factor of 1.2 as compared to the case of intravenous drug administration.", 
    "30": "Diazepam is one of the most widely used, broad-spectrum anti-anxiety agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of diazepam, and to establish whether it is more effective than a placebo in improving the various neurotic anxiety states seen in patients with neurosis or psychosomatic disease. Of the recently established comprehensive register of psychotropic drug trials carried out in Japan, a total of 17 double-blind, randomized controlled trials were identified on the treatment of neurosis using anti-anxiety compounds, in which both diazepam and placebos were used. Meta-analysis of these 17 studies demonstrated that diazepam is significantly more effective than a placebo (relative risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.51, number needed to treat 9). The maximal effective dose of diazepam seems to be 12 or 18 mg/day with a treatment duration of 2 or more weeks. There was no significant difference between the effects of placebo and a diazepam dose of 6 mg/day. Caution should be exercised in assessing these results, however, since this is the first meta-analysis showing the significant effectiveness of diazepam in the treatment of neurosis or psychosomatic disease.", 
    "31": "It has been reported that nizatidine may reduce the weight gain in schizophrenic patients receiving olanzapine treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated a relation between olanzapine-induced weight gain and serum leptin levels. Therefore, in the present study, it was planned to investigate the efficacy of nizatidine on the treatment of olanzapine-induced weight gain, and if available, whether leptin levels were associated with reductions in weight gain. Of the patients with schizophrenia on olanzapine treatment, 59 who gave informed consent entered a 3 month open-label screening period. Of them, 35 patients (59%) showed weight gain in excess of 2.5 kg. These patients were randomly divided into two groups; olanzapine plus nizatidine (group I) and olanzapine plus placebo (group II) for an 8-week double-blind phase. The patients were evaluated at the baseline and at week 8 with respect to the positive and negative syndrome scale, body mass index, weight and serum leptin levels. In the open-label period, olanzapine led to a considerable marked increase in weight and in serum leptin levels. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to weight at the beginning of the 8-week double-blind treatment period. Throughout the 8 week double-blind period, in group I, the weight decreased by 4.5 +/- 2.2 kg ( p<0.05). In contrast, weight increased in group II by a mean of 2.3 +/- 0.9 kg ( p>0.05). The leptin levels decreased by 4.4 +/- 2.3 ng/ml in group I ( p<0.01), and increased by 1.8 +/- 0.6 ng/ml in group II ( p>0.05). These changes were accompanied by changes in the leptin levels in both groups I and II. It is concluded that leptin seems to be strongly associated with olanzapine-induced weight gain and that nizatidine treatment may reduce the weight gain and the correlated leptin levels in patients with schizophrenia on olanzapine treatment.", 
    "32": "A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effect of nizatidine on olanzapine-associated weight gain (OAWG) in ten patients with schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder in Korea. Psychometric ratings with positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) and brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) were measured at baseline, week 4 and week 8; as were weight and body mass index (BMI). A combination of nizatidine for 8 weeks resulted in significant reversal of weight gain without worsening the psychopathology (weight: 3.5% and BMI: 3.7%). In line with studies of Western populations, an add-on therapy of nizatidine could be an effective option for the control of weight gain in olanzapine-treated patients in Korea. Our findings call for further evaluation of the effect of this drug on OAWG, with randomized placebo-controlled studies, in Asian populations.", 
    "33": "In the present naturalistic study, the effectiveness and safety of quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine were compared in the treatment of non selected acutely psychotic patients. It was observed that the rate of antipsychotic switch because of a lack of efficacy or side effects was higher in the quetiapine treated cases in comparison with the risperidone or olanzapine treated cases. The proportion of cases concomitantly treated with typical neuroleptics was significantly higher in the quetiapine group compared with the other two groups. In the outcome of non crossover cases, there were more improvements in the risperidone and olanzapine groups than in the quetiapine group. The results of this study suggest that quetiapine is not as efficacious as risperidone or olanzapine in the emergency psychiatric setting. Due to the methodological limitations of the study, these results must be considered preliminary and need confirmation.",

There was a paucity of well-controlled data and insufficient evidence to support the use of many agents in emergency situations. Many studies had considerable limitations making comparison difficult. Efficacy data for a range of treatment options exists, including the use of classical and atypical anti-psychotic agents, benzodiazepines and combination therapies. Clinical risk, tolerability and environmental factors need to form part of a careful and considered judgement in the choice of treatment.

The mean duration of sedation was 12+/-7 days. The initial half-life t(1/2alpha) was 1.33+/-1.15 h. The observed prolonged elimination half-life (t(1/2beta)=25.5+/-9.4 h) was related to the large volume of distribution (Vdbeta=22.6+/-9.4 l/kg).

    "41": "Paradoxical therapy consists of suggesting that the patient intentionally engages in the unwanted behaviour such as performing compulsive ritual or wanting a conversion attack. In this study, the subjects were selected by the emergency unit psychiatrist from patients who were admitted to the emergency unit with pseudoseizure. The diagnoses was based on DSM-IV criteria. Paradoxical intention was applied to half of the 30 patients with conversion disorders; the other half were treated with diazepam in order to examine the efficiency of the paradoxical intention versus diazepam. In both groups the differences of the anxiety scores at the beginning of the study were found to be insignificant (z=1.08, p=0.28). Of the 15 patients who completed paradoxical intention treatment, 14 (93.3%) responded favorably to paradoxical intention. On the other hand of 15 patients who completed diazepam therapy, 9 (60%) responded well to therapy and 6 patients carried on their conversion symptoms at the end of 6 weeks. Paradoxical intention-treated patients appeared to have greater improvements in anxiety scores (z=2.43, p<0.015) and conversion symptoms (t=2.27, p=0.034) than the diazepam-treated patients. The results of the present study are encouraging in that paradoxical intention can be effective in the treatment of conversion disorder.", 
    "42": "dl-Tetrahydropalmatine (dl-THP), a naturally occurring alkaloid, has been intensively studied for its sedative and hypnotic effects. Putative explanation for its mechanism and target of action involves the dopaminergic neurotransmission system. In view of the close interactions between the dopaminergic and the GABAergic neurons in the amygdala, pharmacological effects of dl-THP were tested for activity at the GABAA receptor benzodiazepine site (BDS). Effects of dl-THP were examined in mice employing the elevated plus-maze, the holeboard and the horizontal-wire tests. In the elevated plus-maze, mice treated with low doses of dl-THP (0.5-10 mg/kg) exhibited significant increase in the percentage of entries and time spent in open arms without altering the number of closed-arm entries when compared to the control group, indicative of its selective anxiolytic effect. In the holeboard and horizontal wire tests, where exploratory behavior and potential muscle relaxant effect were assessed, respectively, only mice treated with as much as 50 mg/kg dl-THP manifested sedation and myorelaxation, as observed in the significant decrease in the number of head dips and the decrease in the percentage of mice grasping wire in comparison to control. Notably, coadministration of the BDS antagonist flumazenil abolished the dl-THP-induced anxiolysis as seen in the reversal of the increase of both the number of entries and time spent in open arms back to basal levels in the elevated plus-maze test. The results suggest that dl-THP at defined low dosages acts as anxiolytics in mice, and the BDS mediates, at least in part, such anxiolytic effect of dl-THP.",

The benefit of olanzapine therapy must be weighed against the adverse effect profiles of olanzapine and alternative treatment options.", 
    "47": "A hip fracture epidemic is occurring in developed countries in association with population aging. The increasing number of people with a hip fracture has major implications for clinicians and health service managers. More importantly, a hip fracture is a devastating event in the life of an older person, as it often leads to loss of independence and death. Identification of risk factors for hip fracture is an essential first step towards prevention. The use of psychotropic medications is an established risk factor for hip fracture. The purpose of this article is to systematically review epidemiological studies of the relationship between use of benzodiazepines and risk of hip fracture and, then, to see how the findings of these studies fit with what is known about the pharmacology of benzodiazepines. Eleven primary epidemiological studies were identified. The results of these studies were not consistent; however, the inconsistency appeared to be almost entirely explained by research design. The studies that did not show an association between increased hip fracture risk and benzodiazepine use were nearly all hospital-based case-control studies, a type of study that often lacks validity because of the difficulty of finding an appropriate control group. After excluding the hospital-based case-control studies, all but one of the remaining seven studies found that use of benzodiazepines was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture that varied between 50% and 110%. The only higher quality study that did not find an association between benzodiazepine use and hip fracture was also the only study conducted entirely in nursing homes. There was no evidence that the risk of hip fracture differed between short- and long-acting benzodiazepines. People using higher doses of benzodiazepines and those who had recently started using benzodiazepines were at the highest risk of hip fracture. In very old people, there was some preliminary evidence that benzodiazepines that undergo oxidation in the liver may be associated with a higher risk of hip fracture than other benzodiazepines. The epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that the use of benzodiazepines by older people increases their risk of hip fracture by at least 50%. The benefits of benzodiazepines for older people are unclear. Given the high morbidity and mortality of hip fracture, it can be concluded that older people should rarely be prescribed benzodiazepines and that many older people already taking these drugs should have them withdrawn under appropriate supervision.", 
    "48": "A growing body of literature suggests that certain atypical antipsychotics, especially olanzapine and clozapine, may induce glucoregulatory dysfunction. We assessed the differences in risk of developing diabetes mellitus during treatment with olanzapine and risperidone by using patients treated with haloperidol and fluphenazine as control subjects in whom we would not expect to see an increased risk.", 
    "49": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Veteran's Integrated Service Network 10 Veterans Affairs (VA) database. Data for patients receiving olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, or fluphenazine from January 1, 1997-December 31, 2000, were included. Diabetes was defined as any health system encounter associated with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis for diabetes (250.xx) or prescription for a hypoglycemic agent. Data of patients with markers for diabetes within 1 year before their index date, female patients, racial groups other than Caucasian or African-American, and patients receiving clozapine were not analyzed. We performed a Cox regression, with antipsychotic therapy as a time-dependent covariate. Other covariates considered for inclusion in the final model were number of days supply of antipsychotic drug, age, race, psychiatric diagnoses, substance abuse, lithium, valproic acid, and other typical or atypical antipsychotic agents.", 
    "50": "Data for 5837 patients were analyzed. Overall rate of developing diabetes in the study population was 6.3% (368 of 5837 patients). Olanzapine therapy was associated with a significantly higher risk of development of diabetes compared with risperidone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.76, p=0.016) while controlling for race, age, diagnosis, substance abuse, lithium, valproic acid, and other atypical antipsychotic agents. No differences in the rate of developing diabetes were detected between fluphenazine and risperidone (HR 1.11, p=0.69), or haloperidol and risperidone (HR 0.89, p=0.41).",

For non-zero epochs, the mean activity count and the distribution of activity counts did not differ significantly among groups. There were no positive findings on the SAS or the BAS.", 
    "58": "Olanzapine decreased total motor activity by increasing the amount of time during which subjects were immobile, rather than by affecting the magnitude of movement during periods in which there was activity. This effect occurred at a dose of olanzapine low enough not to cause clinically observed extrapyramidal side effects. Our results suggest that actigraphy is useful as a sensitive, noninvasive tool for measuring the effect of antipsychotics on spontaneous motor activity.",

Intravenous diazepam or midazolam are used by the majority of endoscopists in the United States, though it is not common practice in Turkey where this study was conducted. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midazolam in performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. A total of 352 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were sedated with midazolam given as a bolus injection over 5 seconds. Ages of the patients ranged between 16 and 79 years (average: 41.6 +/- 12.7 years).

    "65": "Serial verbal learning task (explicit long-term memory) and verbal fluency (generation of a response) are tests that are usually severely impaired in schizophrenia. Despite the growing literature supporting the clinical efficacy of olanzapine, psychiatrists still question its cognitive consequences. This study assessed the efficacy of olanzapine on neurocognitive functioning. Patients (N = 134) meeting diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorders began an 8-week, open-label olanzapine treatment at a dose of 5 mg/d, which was increased to 10 mg/d after 1 week. Daily dosage was subsequently adjusted between 5 and 20 mg/d based on individual clinical status. All previous antipsychotics were tapered and discontinued during the first 2 weeks of the study. Neuropsychologic assessments were carried out at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. Explicit long-term memory was assessed with the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test: the average immediate recall score significantly improved (P < 0.001), as did the delayed recall score (P < 0.001). The average total score on category fluency improved from 34.6 words at baseline to 37.6 words at end point (P < 0.0001). Time on both Trail A and B making tasks significantly decreased (P < 0.0001). Lack of a control arm makes it impossible to exclude a practice effect as an explanation for the enhanced cognitive performance, although the Word List Recall test represents one of the better resources to avoid a practice effect. After switching to olanzapine, there was a statistically significant improvement of cognitive function in the 3 main domains tested and no significant worsening of any memory or executive function measure.", 
    "66": "Alcohol detoxification is accompanied by sustained difficulties in sleep initiation and maintenance. These difficulties are thought to be an important cause of relapse to alcohol use. However, the treatment of sleep problems with hypnotic drug is made difficult by cross-tolerance between benzodiazepines and alcohol. In this report, we evaluated the capacity of trazodone (TRZ), a second-generation antidepressant with anxiolytic and sedative properties, to increase the sleep efficiency in alcohol-dependent patients after detoxification. Sixteen patients completed the TRZ (n = 8) or the placebo (PL; n = 8) treatment arms. Polysomnographies were performed at baseline, after the 1st drug dose, and after 4 weeks of treatment. The main outcome was sleep efficiency. Secondary outcomes included changes in other sleep parameters, Hamilton Depression Rating and Clinical Global Impression scales. Sleep efficiency was increased in the TRZ group when it was computed after sleep onset, both immediately after 1st administration of the drug and after 4 weeks of treatment. No benefit was observed in the PL group. Sleep improvement under TRZ also included the number of awakenings, intermittent wake sleep time, and non-rapid eye movement sleep. Hamilton and Clinical Global scales were better for the TRZ group. TRZ is thus a potential option in the treatment of alcohol post-withdrawal insomnia.", 
    "67": "Two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of olanzapine in acute mania showed significant overall antimanic efficacy, based on reductions in mania ratings. Their subject-level data were pooled to increase statistical power to test for differences in treatment responses among 10 subgroup pairs of interest using generalized estimating equations methods. Similar drug/placebo superiority and responsiveness to olanzapine was found in men versus women, psychotic versus nonpsychotic subjects, and those presenting in mania versus mixed states, and responses were independent of onset age, current age, or prior illness based on episodes, hospitalizations, recent rapid cycling, lifetime substance use, or previous antipsychotic treatment. Olanzapine and placebo responses paralleled closely (r(s) = 0.73). Patients were relatively more responsive to olanzapine who were younger at illness onset, lacked prior substance abuse, and had not previously received antipsychotic treatment (efficacy ratios 1.5-1.7, all P < 0.01). These well-powered comparisons of subgroups of interest indicate broad efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania.", 
    "68": "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant fluoxetine inhibits alprazolam metabolism in vivo by inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant that has not yet been fully evaluated with respect to its potential for cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated drug interactions in vivo. Building on the existing in vitro and in vivo evidence that suggest a minimal effect of citalopram on cytochrome P450 3A4, we hypothesized that therapeutic doses of citalopram (20 mg/d), as compared with fluoxetine (20 mg/d), would cause less impairment in the metabolism of the probe drug alprazolam (1 mg) through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme as measured by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in vivo. We found that fluoxetine prolonged the half-life of alprazolam by 16% and increased the area under the curve 0-infinity of alprazolam by 32%, while citalopram did not affect these parameters, although the time of maximum concentration of alprazolam was prolonged by 30 minutes after citalopram administration. Neither selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor significantly affected the pharmacodynamic profile of alprazolam. This experiment suggests differential effects by citalopram and fluoxetine on alprazolam kinetics.", 
    "69": "Patients experiencing an acute decompensation of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder often present in an agitated state. Agitation presents a barrier to therapy, interrupting the typical physician-patient alliance and creating a disruptive, even hazardous, environment. Rapid assessment and effective treatment are necessary to manage agitation and, potentially, to shorten the time to recovery.", 
    "70": "One hundred forty-eight acutely agitated patients received either: rapid initial dose escalation (RIDE) in which up to 40 mg of oral olanzapine was allowed on days 1 and 2, up to 30 mg on days 3 and 4, and 5 to 20 mg thereafter; or usual clinical practice (UCP) in which patients received 10 mg/d olanzapine plus up to 4 mg lorazepam on days 1 and 2, up to 2 mg on days 3 and 4, and olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d thereafter. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC: poor impulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement) measured at 24 hours was the primary measure. Secondary assessments of agitation and safety were also performed.", 
    "71": "Agitation improved significantly from baseline for both treatment groups; however, improvement with the RIDE strategy was superior to UCP. The RIDE group improvement was superior on the primary efficacy measure (PANSS-Excited) at 24 hours; it was superior on all agitation measures at the end of double-blind treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no clinically significant differences in safety measures. Treatment was not limited by oversedation and attention improved from baseline in both groups.",

    "73": "Novel antipsychotics impart substantial weight gain. Persons with bipolar disorder are frequently treated with these and other agents known to impart substantial weight gain. We sought to describe the influence of adjunctive risperidone and olanzapine on body weight, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and serum leptin levels over a prospective observation period of 6 months. Throughout the 6-month investigation, significant increases from baseline to end point in weight were noted with both agents; with significantly greater weight gain with olanzapine (t(10) = 2.761, P = 0.023; t(9) = 4.783, P = 0.001). Leptin levels were highly correlated with increases in weight and were significantly elevated from baseline at 4 months (r = 0.658, P < 0.05). Significant increases in weight and body mass index were apparent at 3 months (P < 0.05). The temporal association between weight increase and leptin changes does not support the notion that leptin is a primary promoter of antipsychotic-induced weight gain; however, a secondary perpetuating role cannot be ruled out.", 
    "74": "Clozapine has recently been associated with venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to describe three elderly patients in whom olanzapine therapy was associated with venous thromboembolism. During a 4-month period at the same psychogeriatric clinic, three elderly patients (an 89-year-old male, a 78-year-old male and an 83-year-old female) developed deep venous thrombosis shortly after treatment with olanzapine was initiated. Two of the patients also had symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. None had previously been diagnosed with venous thromboembolism. These cases indicate that venous thromboembolism might be associated with the use of olanzapine, at least in geriatric patients. Subjects treated with olanzapine should be monitored clinically for venous thromboembolism to ensure early detection and prompt intervention, and a possible discontinuation of treatment with olanzapine should be considered after a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.", 
    "75": "Atypical antipsychotics are the first-line treatment for psychosis and are commonly used for behavioural problems in people with intellectual disabilities (ID), but a comprehensive evidence base for this approach is lacking. We studied prescription trends and the clinical effectiveness of risperidone and olanzapine in people with ID in a clinical, naturalistic setting. The results suggest that both drugs are well tolerated and effective in treating target symptoms across a range of diagnoses and ID. Both risperidone and olanzapine appear to reach full efficacy within 3 months, after which improvement reaches a plateau, as reflected in the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Compliance with both drugs is high. Olanzapine tended to be prescribed mostly for psychotic disorders, and showed good rates of response, whereas risperidone was prescribed mostly for people with behavioural disturbance associated with a psychiatric diagnosis. Furthermore, approximately one-quarter of the risperidone group were prescribed the medication for a behavioural disorder associated with a pervasive developmental disorder. Again, the medication was broadly effective in treatment. Both medications were also used to effectively treat affective disorders in a small percentage of patients. This study appears to indicate that both medications could be of significant clinical benefit for people with ID across a wide range of diagnoses and level of ID, although further controlled trials are required.", 
    "76": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the objective and subjective efficacy as well as tolerability of olanzapine in acute treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders under naturalistic non-selective conditions. Inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, consecutively admitted over an 18-month period, treated with olanzapine, were included. Diagnoses were made according to ICD-10 criteria based on repeated clinical assessments. Efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine were assessed at baseline and at the end of inpatient acute treatment including Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression, subjective assessments, UKU and biological investigations. One hundred and twenty non-selected patients who met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia (73%), schizophreniform disorder (14%) or schizoaffective disorder (13%) were treated with olanzapine 15.3+/-5.2 mg/day. Baseline severity (PANSS total mean score 102.2) was higher compared to various admittance studies (PANSS total mean score 86-90). In 32% of patients (n=38), olanzapine treatment was discontinued, mainly because of inefficacy for positive (89%, n=34) and/or negative (95%, n=36) symptoms and/or because of adverse events (37%, n=14). Response rates as improvement in PANSS total score (after > or =3 weeks of treatment) of > or =20%, 30% or 40% were 68%, 55% and 35%, respectively. Response rates in post-hoc defined treatment resistant patients were not significantly different from non-refractory patients. Sedation (26%) was the most common side-effect, followed by weight gain (22%). With regards to subjective efficacy, 30% of the patients were not satisfied with the efficacy of olanzapine, while only 6% of the patients reported a not satisfying subjective tolerability. According to duration of olanzapine treatment, the results for patients, who remained in hospital, revealed a faster increase of weight compared to admittance studies (7 kg in 14 weeks versus 7 kg in 38 weeks). Olanzapine has been found to be effective and tolerable, also under naturalistic acute treatment conditions. Compared to previous double-blind admittance studies, patients had a higher severity of illness at entry and a lower > or =40% PANSS total score response rate. By contrast to previous results, mean dose of olanzapine was similar for multiple- and first-episode patients, and weight gain was more severe. The results underline the need of Phase IV studies for the assessment of clinical antipsychotic efficacy and tolerability.",

    "81": "In addition to blocking cyclooxygenases, members of the fenamate group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been proposed to affect brain GABAA receptors. Using quantitative autoradiography with GABAA receptor-associated ionophore ligand [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) on rat brain sections, one of the fenamates, niflumate, at micromolar concentration was found to potentiate GABA actions in most brain areas, whereas being in the cerebellar granule cell layer an efficient antagonist similar to furosemide. With recombinant GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we found that niflumate potentiated 3 microM GABA responses up to 160% and shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the left in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors, the predominant GABAA receptor subtype in the brain. This effect needed the gamma2 subunit, because on alpha1beta2 receptors, niflumate exhibited solely an antagonistic effect at high concentrations. The potentiation was not abolished by the specific benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. Niflumate acted as a potent antagonist of alpha6beta2 receptors (with or without gamma2 subunit) and of alphaXbeta2gamma2 receptors containing a chimeric alpha1 to alpha6 subunit, which suggests that niflumate antagonism is dependent on the same transmembrane domain 1- and 2-including fragment of the alpha6 subunit as furosemide antagonism. This antagonism was noncompetitive because the maximal GABA response, but not the potency, was reduced by niflumate. These data show receptor subtype-dependent positive and negative modulatory actions of niflumate on GABAA receptors at clinically relevant concentrations, and they suggest the existence of a novel positive modulatory site on alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors that is dependent on the gamma2 subunit but not associated with the benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "82": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated drug efflux and cytochrome p450 3A (CYP3A) metabolism within the enterocyte have been implicated as potential biochemical barriers to intestinal drug permeability. The current studies examined the in vitro intestinal permeability of verapamil, a common P-gp and CYP3A substrate, using both disappearance and appearance measurements, and investigated the possible impact of P-gp efflux on the intestinal extraction of verapamil. Bidirectional permeability and metabolism studies were conducted across rat jejunal tissue in side-by-side diffusion chambers and data were modeled using compartmental kinetics. Substantial tissue uptake of verapamil was evident in the in vitro model and resulted in a disappearance permeability coefficient that was approximately 10-fold greater than that determined from verapamil appearance in the receptor chamber. Polarization of the bidirectional transport of verapamil was evident due to P-gp efflux (efflux ratio of 2.5), and significant intestinal extraction of verapamil on passage across the tissue was observed (mucosal to serosal extraction ratio of 0.31 +/- 0.04). Surprisingly, the selective P-gp inhibitor, valspodar (PSC833), had an insignificant impact on P-gp-mediated efflux of verapamil; however, selective CYP3A inhibition (afforded by midazolam) increased mucosal to serosal verapamil transport 1.6-fold, presumably through a reduction in intestinal metabolism. Using a four-compartment model, simulations of the impact of P-gp on the intestinal extraction ratio of verapamil demonstrated that for efflux to increase intestinal extraction, a nonlinear relationship must exist between the extent of drug metabolism and the extent of drug transport; the origin of this \"nonlinearity\" may include saturable drug metabolism, accumulation, and/or distribution.", 
    "83": "The potential of substrates and modifiers of CYP3A4 to show differential effects, attributed to the existence of multiple binding sites, confounds the straightforward prediction of in vivo drug-drug interactions from in vitro data. A set of in vitro interaction studies was performed in human lymphoblast-expressed CYP3A4 involving representatives of two CYP3A4 subclasses, midazolam (MDZ) and testosterone (TST); a distinct subgroup, nifedipine (NIF); and its structural analog, felodipine (FEL). Mechanistic insight into the interaction of each pair of substrates was provided by employing a range of multisite kinetic models; most were subtypes of a generic two-site model, but a three-site model was required for TST interactions. The complexity of the inhibition profiles and the selection of the kinetic model with appropriate interaction factors were dependent upon the kinetics of substrates involved (hyperbolic, substrate inhibition, or sigmoidal for MDZ/FEL, NIF, and TST, respectively). In no case was a simple reciprocity seen between pairs of substrates. The interaction profiles observed between TST, MDZ, NIF, and FEL involved several atypical inhibition features (partial, cooperative, concentration-dependent loss of characteristic homotropic behavior) and pathway-differential effects reflecting an 80-fold difference in Ki values and a delta factor (defining the alteration in the binding affinity in the presence of a modifier) ranging from 0.04 to 2.3. The conclusions from the multisite kinetic analysis performed support the hypothesis of distinct binding domains for each substrate subgroup. Furthermore, the analysis of intersubstrate interactions strongly indicates the existence of a mutual binding domain common to each of the three CYP3A4 substrate subclasses.", 
    "84": "Depression and the behavioral symptoms associated with dementia remain two of the most significant mental health issues for nursing home residents. The extensive literature on these conditions in nursing homes was reviewed to provide an expert panel with an evidence base for making recommendations on the assessment and treatment of these problems. Numerous assessment instruments have been validated for depression and for behavioral symptoms. The Minimum Data Set, as routinely collected, appears to be of limited utility as a screening instrument for depression but is useful for assessing some behavioral symptoms. Laboratory evaluations are often recommended, but no systematic study of the outcomes of these evaluations could be found. Studies of nonpharmacological interventions out-number those of pharmacological interventions, and randomized, controlled trials document the efficacy of many interventions. Antidepressants are effective for major depression, but data for minor depressive syndromes are limited. Recreational activities are effective for major and minor depression categories. Neither pharmacological nor nonpharmacological interventions totally eliminate behavioral symptoms, but both types of interventions decrease the severity of symptoms. In the absence of comparison studies, it is unclear whether one approach is more effective than another. Despite federal regulations limiting their use, antipsychotics are effective and remain the most studied medications for treating behavioral symptoms, whereas benzodiazepines and antidepressants have less support. Structured activities are effective, but training interventions for behavioral symptoms had limited results. There are sufficient data to formulate an evidenced-based approach to treatment of depression and behavioral symptoms, but more research is needed to prioritize treatments.", 
    "85": "Alprazolam (ALP), a benzodiazepine-activating GABAergic receptor, possesses clear centrally mediated inhibitory effects on ACTH and cortisol secretion that could reflect an inhibitory influence on CRH- and/or AVP-secreting neurones. An inhibitory effect of ALP on catecholamine release has also been shown while its effect on GH secretion is unclear. To further clarify the neuroendocrine actions of ALP, we studied the ALP effects on the neurohormonal responses to hypoglycaemia in a group of normal subjects.",

    "90": "The QTc prolongation by antipsychotic drugs is of major concern, especially in light of the data indicating an increased risk of sudden death in psychiatric patients taking these drugs. Sudden death in psychiatric patients could be partially attributed to drug-induced torsades de pointes and for this reason careful evaluation of QTc prolonging properties of antipsychotic drugs is needed. Antipsychotic drugs prolong QT interval usually by blocking the potassium IKr current. Improved understanding of ion channel structure and kinetics and its role in repolarization has tremendous impact on understanding of the mechanisms of drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Proarrhythmia caused by a QT-prolonging drug occurs infrequently, and usually multiple factors need to operate to precipitate such an event including a combination of two or more drugs affecting the same pathway, hypokalemia, and possibly genetic predisposition. Currently prescribed antipsychotics might cause QT prolongation ranging from 4-6 ms for haloperidol and olanzapine to 35 ms for thioridazine. The response of a patient to a drug is very individual and therefore an individualized system of drug administration and monitoring needs to be developed which takes into account baseline QTc duration and its changes after a drug was introduced. A systematic approach while stratifying psychiatric patients as those with short QTc (QTc < or = 0.41 sec), borderline QTc (QTC = 0.42-0.44 sec), and prolonged QTc (0.45 sec) is being proposed to improve the safety of administering antipsychotic drugs and to decrease the risk of drug-related sudden death in psychiatric patients.", 
    "91": "A total of 46 patients, aged 9 to 14, who underwent the artificial ventilation of the lungs (AVL) for diffusive purulent peritonitis with laparostoma, spastic syndrome, destructive pneumonia, and crania-cerebral trauma of different severities, were investigated. The patients were divided into 3 groups with respect to a medicamental sedation. Group 1--bolus dosing of a 20% solution of gamma oxy-oil acid (GOOA), 75-100 mg/kg; group 2--bolus dosing of a 1% solution of thiopental sodium (5-7 mg/kg); and group 3--micro-flow introduction of dormycum (0.1 mg/kg x h). The central hemodynamics was studied by the NCCKOM apparatus (\"Bomed\", USA) by applying a non-invasive technique. Stroke volume, cardiac rate, circulation minute volume, mean arterial pressure and general peripheral vascular resistance were determined. The sedation level was assessed by Cook's and Palma's scale (1989). The above investigations showed that all used techniques insured a satisfactory functioning of the cardiovascular system, but the highest stability of parameters was registered in the group, in which COOA was applied. The highest level of sedation and comfort was registered in the group of patients, which received dormycum. A conclusion was made on the basis of the conducted study that the technique of the micro-flow introduction of dormycum indicated for AVL in children is an adequate and stable sedation technique producing a minimal impact on the hemodynamics.",

The conclusions of the 10 studies that compared methadone with adrenergic agonists showed no substantial clinical difference of the two treatments in terms of retention in treatment, degree of discomfort and detoxification success rates. The conclusions of the 6 studies that compare different methadone reduction schedules, showed that different types of methadone withdrawal schedule produce different responses in terms of time course of withdrawal, the severity of withdrawal response and possibly in terms of subsequent engagement with treatment. Regarding the studies that compare methadone with other opioid agonists, in Sorensen 1982 methadyl acetate performed similarly to methadone on most process and outcome measures, while in Tennant 1975, methadone reduced severity of withdrawal and had fewer drop-outs than did a propoxyphene group. In Drummond 1989, using chlordiazepoxide vs methadone, the results suggest that the two drugs had similar results in terms of overall effectiveness.San 1992 compared methadone with placebo and found more severe withdrawal and more drop outs in the placebo group. The results indicate that tapered methadone and other medications used in the included studies are effective in the treatment of the heroin withdrawal syndrome, although symptoms experienced by subjects differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. It seems that regardless of which medication is selected for heroin detoxification, the rates of subsequent heroin abstinence are about equal. This suggests that the medications are similar in terms of overall effectiveness. Improvements were achieved when other services such as counseling and other supporting services were offered contemporaneously with detoxification.",

The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long acting opioids, accompanied by medicaopioids, accompanied by medical supervision and ancillary medications can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. However this cannot be considered a goal for a detoxification as heroin dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder and the goal of detoxification should be to remove or reduce dependence on heroin in a controlled and human fashion and not a treatment for heroin dependence.",

Certain progesterone metabolite 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one, or allopregnanolone (ALLO), increases the GABA-mediated chloride ion (Cl(-)) flux through GABA(A) receptors in a similar fashion as benzodiazepines and barbiturates. We have studied the effect of its 3beta diastereomer, 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one, or isoallopregnanolone (ISO), on the Cl(-) flux and investigated the interaction between ISO and ALLO on GABA-mediated Cl(-) uptake in cortical homogenates from adult male Wistar rats. We found that ISO from 1 microM to 1 mM does not affect baseline Cl(-) uptake in rat cortical homogenates. Neither does ISO at dose range of 100 nM to 100 microM interact with 10 microM GABA in the Cl(-) uptake assay. In addition, ISO at the dose range of 1-30 microM does not affect flunitrazepam and pentobarbital-induced increase of Cl(-) uptake. We conclude that ISO selectively inhibits the ALLO-induced Cl(-) uptake with respect to ALLO concentrations. The IC(50) of ISO inhibition on 1 microM ALLO-induced Cl(-) uptake was calculated to be 12.25 microM. On the other hand, we have studied the effect of 30 microM ISO on ALLO (0.01 nM to 1 microM) induced displacement of tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding. We did not note any interaction between ALLO and ISO on TBPS binding assay.

Recently, elevated apoD levels have been reported in the post-mortem brains, as well as plasma, of schizophrenic patients and in rodent brains after chronic treatment with clozapine (CLOZ). These findings and the evidence for altered membrane lipid metabolism in schizophrenia suggest that apoD may have a role in the pathophysiology of illness, and also in the differential clinical outcome following treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs. Here, we compared the effects of these antipsychotics on the expression of apoD in rat brain. Chronic treatment with typical antipsychotic, haloperidol (HAL) reduced apoD expression in hippocampus, piriform cortex and caudate-putamen (p = 0.027-0.002), whereas atypical antipsychotics, risperidone (RISP) and olanzapine (OLZ) increased (p = 0.051 to < 0.001 and p = 0.048 to < 0.001, respectively) apoD expression. In hippocampus, HAL-induced changes were present in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus, however, apoD levels in motor cortex were unchanged. There were also very dramatic effects of HAL on the neuronal morphology, particularly, cellular shrinkage and disorganization with the loss of neuropil. Post-treatment, either with RISP or OLZ, was very effective in restoring the HAL-induced reduction of apoD, as well as cellular morphology. Similarly, pre-treatments were also effective, but slightly less than post-treatment, in preventing HAL-induced reduction of apoD. The increased expression of apoD by atypical antipsychotics may reflect a novel molecular mechanism underlying their favorable effects compared with HAL on cognition, negative symptoms and extra-pyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia.",

Dreams were very common and generally positive in nature. A minimum of 0.1 mg.kg-1 of diazepam was needed to significantly reduce dreaming when compared with water (67.5% vs. 94.6%; p < 0.0001), and to significantly lower median (95% CI) emergence delirium scores (4 (3-4) vs. 6 (5-7)). Gender and age did not affect the rate of dreaming. Increasing the dose of diazepam did not improve the dream experience. Patient satisfaction scores were similar between groups. Increases in blood pressure and heart rate were greater in dreamers than in non-dreamers. All groups had high rate-pressure products but this was highest when diazepam was not used. Higher diazepam doses significantly reduced the increase in blood pressure and heart rate at 3 and 6 min postketamine. When used with ketamine and fentanyl, 0.1 mg.kg-1 of diazepam has favourable psychic and cardiovascular effects. Lower diazepam doses generally had little effect whereas larger doses did not enhance the benefits further.",

Atorvastatin is also metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 and, in vitro, atorvastatin inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of mexazolam. We hypothesised that concurrent administration of atorvastatin and midazolam would result in altered midazolam pharmacokinetics. Fourteen patients scheduled to undergo general anaesthesia for elective surgery were recruited in a matched pair design to receive intravenous midazolam (0.15 mg.kg-1). Of these patients, seven were taking long-term atorvastatin. Atorvastatin patients demonstrated a greater area under the curve (889.4 (standard deviation 388.6) ng-h.ml-1) vs. control patients (629.1 (standard deviation 197.2) ng-h.ml-1) (p < 0.05).

They were used during initiatory, divinatory rites and played an essential role in the myths of exorcism and charm where the initiated enters a sort of trance which separates the soul from the body before \"revival\". It resulted that a number of plants were given names reflecting their relationship with the divinities, bestowing upon them an aura of mystery and sacredness. With the development of free information superhighways via the net, recipes using these hallucinogenic substances can now travel anywhere on the planet, offering the non-initiated a means of experimenting their search for strong sensations. At the same time, the science of botany has undergone a major revolution. Patient observation of nature is no longer necessary since a well-conducted computer search can easily yield a large supply of plants offered for on-line purchase. Children and adolescents in primary and secondary schools are becoming a new target for the botanical market: young people exchange the latest recipes and Internet addresses, or more simply the objects of their new on-line purchase. This has led to an outbreak in the use of mushrooms and hallucinogenic plants where the cultural notion of initiation or sacred rites has metamorphosed into a phenomenon of communication between young people, notably during festive parties. Datura stramonium has become quite popular and the number of hospitalizations for acute datura poisoning has increased rapidly, as indicated by the statistics of the Bordeaux Poison Center (14 hospitalizations for voluntary poisonings with datura in 2002, compared with 5 in 2001). Besides the self-inflicted risk, one of the most important problems is the delay to diagnosis, simply because the primary care physician did not think of such an \"exotic\" cause. We report here the case of a 22-year-old young man hospitalized following ingestion Datura stramonium seeds. He presented confusions and dreamlike frenzy.

    "142": "In considering the characteristics of the action of anxiolytic drugs and their mechanism in the brain, it may be necessary not only to study the behavioral pharmacology but also to perform brain site research. In the present study, the action of anxiolytic drugs was examined with respect to various behaviors that were induced by stimulating the brain areas related to emotions such as reward (pleasure) or aversion in rats. First, the low rate of response in lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior was induced by schedules of low current brain stimulation, variable interval (VI) and differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL). Anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines facilitated these low-rate responses. The drug susceptibility was highest in the low current stimulation, lower in the VI stimulation, and lowest in the DRL stimulation schedules. Furthermore, it was found by the auto-titration method in intracranial self-stimulation behavior that anxiolytic drugs decreased the threshold of stimulation reward. Second, it was recognized using the decremental lever pressing (DLP) paradigm that anxiolytic drugs increased the threshold of aversive stimulation of mesencephalic dorsal central gray (DCG), and this increasing effect of the drug was antagonized by GABA receptor blockers such as biccuculline. Finally, it was examined whether or not the conflict situation is established by combining brain stimulation reward and aversion, such as foot-shock or DCG stimulation. As a result, the conflict behavior was established by combining not only the brain stimulation reward and foot-shock aversion, but also the brain stimulation reward and DCG stimulation aversion. Further anxiolytic drugs exhibited anti-conflict action in both situations. The susceptibility of anxiolytic drugs was higher with respect to the conflict behavior induced by intracranial reward and aversion than to that induced by the conventional method based on milk reward and foot-shock aversion. These results suggest that behavioral methods using brain stimulation can examine the mechanisms of direct drug action at the brain stimulation site. Indeed, in the present brain stimulation behavioral study, anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines increased the stimulation threshold in lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation and inhibited the DCG aversive stimulation, thus resulting in an anticonflict action of the drugs.", 
    "143": "Narcotics and benzodiazepines are commonly used for sedation for endoscopy in the United States. Propofol has certain advantages over narcotics and benzodiazepines, but its use is often controlled by anesthesia specialists. This report describes our experience with dosage, safety, patient satisfaction, and discharge time with nurse-administered propofol sedation in 9152 endoscopic cases. The study was performed in a private practice ambulatory surgery center in Medford, Oregon. With the assistance of an anesthesiologist, we developed a protocol for administration of propofol in routine endoscopic cases, in which propofol was given by registered nurses under the supervision of endoscopists or gastroenterologists. We then applied the protocol with 9152 patients. There were seven cases of respiratory compromise (three prolonged apnea, three laryngospasm, one aspiration requiring hospitalization), all associated with upper endoscopy. Five patients required mask ventilation, but none required endotracheal intubation. There were seven colonic perforations (<1 per 1000 colonoscopies), of which three may have involved forceful sigmoid disruption. Of patients who had previously received narcotic or benzodiazepine sedation, 84% preferred propofol. Gastroenterologists strongly preferred propofol. The mean time from completion of procedures to discharge in a sample of 100 patients was 18 min.Nurse-administered propofol sedation in an ambulatory surgery center was safe and resulted in high levels of patient satisfaction and rapid postprocedure recovery and discharge.", 
    "144": "We studied the clinical features of 12 patients with localization-related epilepsy (LRE) associated with absence seizures (AS). AS did not appear in any patients before partial seizures (PS) were first observed. The interval between the onset of PS and AS ranged from 1 month to 7.2 years (mean 2.11 years). The duration of AS (mean 5 months) was short compared with that of PS (mean 3.8 years). Carbamazepine (CBZ) was used in seven patients at the onset of AS. It was discontinued in five but continued in the other two. AS was initially treated with valproate in ten patients. Three of them needed additional antiepileptic drugs: clonazepam in two patients and ethosuximide in one. All patients became free from AS after treatment for AS was started, whereas PS was relatively intractable. Generalized spike-and-waves were often observed before the onset of AS. The interval between the first appearance of generalized spike-and-waves and the onset of AS ranged from 1 to 53 months (mean 20 months). AS in patients with LRE will be relatively benign and transient, and will respond well to antiepileptic drugs.",

Ninety patients were randomized to receive lorazepam (n = 47) or a placebo (n = 43). A computer-generated random number table was used for group assignment. Concealment was maintained by the hospital pharmacy, which prepared and dispensed the medication. Physicians, nurses, and patients were blinded to the group assignment. The time of the first spontaneous void and other information about the surgery and recovery were then recorded.", 
    "147": "There was no difference in the overall mean time to void between the lorazepam (3.1 +/- 1.2 hours) and placebo (2.8 +/- 2.0 hours) groups (P =.5).

    "154": "While patients at the different centers varied in their demographic and clinical characteristics, i. e., age, sex, and length of illness, a great variation in prescription patterns for antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs among centers was observed even within the same country for all the variables studied (i. e., number and dose antipsychotics, atypical and depot antipsychotics, other psychotropic drugs, multiple antipsychotics, and daily dose) except antidepressant use. In most cases these differences persisted even after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, and length of illness) of the subjects. Antipsychotics were usually prescribed in divided daily doses in combination with one or more other psychotropic drugs, including anticholinergics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Anticholinergic use was more common with typical antipsychotics. Rates of atypical antipsychotic drug use were lowest in the Japanese center. The Japanese center had by far the highest mean daily dose of antipsychotics.", 
    "155": "The results indicate that prescription patterns in different centers do not follow any specific guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia. The results also confirm previous findings that prescribing practices for schizophrenia vary greatly among centers and countries. A common prescribing pattern found was the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in combination with psychotropic drugs, such as anticholinergics, hypnotics, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines, administered in multiple daily doses.", 
    "156": "Previous studies suggest that antipsychotic medications may alter cortical inhibition (CI). The current study was designed to determine if typical or atypical antipsychotics indeed alter CI in healthy subjects using three CI paradigms as measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), cortical silent period (CSP) and transcallosal inhibition (TCI). CI was measured before, 6 and 24 h after being randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 2 mg haloperidol (n=8), 10 mg olanzapine (n=10) or placebo (n=9). There was no significant effect on any measure of CI at 6 and 24 h after receiving olanzapine, haloperidol or placebo. Moreover, no significant change in the motor threshold was observed across the three medication groups. Therefore, single administration of an antipsychotic has no effect on CI or resting motor threshold. Whether chronic, repeated administration of antipsychotics has effects on CI requires further investigation.",

    "163": "Diffuse cognitive impairment characterizes patients with schizophrenia throughout the course of illness. The deficits persist despite clinical improvement associated with neuroleptic intervention and are related to outcome. It is unclear whether treatment with atypical agents is associated with improved cognition that relates to symptoms and outcome. Using a set of computerized neurocognitive measures, we evaluated whether the effects of olanzapine are greater than practice effects for specific neurocognitive domains that could provide targets for large-scale randomized studies. We enrolled 19 patients with schizophrenia before initiation of treatment with olanzapine and 16 of them were examined at 6 weeks and 6 months of follow-up. They were compared to 34 healthy participants who enrolled, 24 of whom were evaluated longitudinally. Improvement exceeding practice effects was observed in patients for abstraction and spatial memory and the latter correlated with clinical improvement in negative symptoms. These results suggest that some effects of olanzapine may impact both symptoms and cognitive performance.", 
    "164": "The effect of mirtazapine on steady-state plasma concentrations of the newer atypical antipsychotics clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine was investigated in 24 patients with chronic schizophrenia. In order to treat residual negative symptoms, additional mirtazapine (30 mg per day) was administered for six consecutive weeks to nine patients stabilized on clozapine therapy (200-650 mg per day), eight on risperidone (3-8 mg per day) and seven on olanzapine (10-20mg per day). There were only minimal and statistically insignificant changes in mean plasma concentrations of clozapine and its metabolite norclozapine, risperidone and its metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and olanzapine during the study period. Mirtazapine co-administration with either clozapine, risperidone or olanzapine was well tolerated. In the overall sample, a slight improvement in negative symptomatology, as assessed by the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, was observed at final evaluation (P<0.01) and six patients (two in each treatment group) were classified as responders. While double-blind, controlled studies are needed to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of mirtazapine in chronic schizophrenia, our findings indicate that mirtazapine has a negligible effect on the metabolism of clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine and can be added safely to an existing treatment with these antipsychotics.",

Within this series, several compounds have excellent in vitro potency and our computational models accurately justify the structure-activity relationships (SARs) and highlight essential hydrogen bonding residues and hydrophobic pockets within the catalytic domain of PARP-1. Administration of these compounds (5q, 17a and 17e) in the mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes results in maintainance of glucose levels.

    "166": "Cadmium (Cd) toxicity was produced in male rats to study the role of cholinoceptors in Cd-induced endothelial dysfunction. The changes in the tension of the aortic rings to constrictor and dilator agonists were compared with those of controls. A Cd-induced significant increase in phenylephrine response was associated with a decrease in basal dilator prostanoid release. In Cd-exposed rings, despite an obvious depression in the acetylcholine (ACh) response, the receptor-independent dilation to the calcium ionophore A23187, which elicits a receptor-independent endothelial relaxation, was slightly elevated (p<0.01), but the smooth muscle cell response to the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) remained unaltered. Cadmium decreased both the maximal response to ACh (10(-5) M) and its pirenzepine (Prz) sensitive component. The M1 type cholinoceptor-mediated response to ACh decreased in Cd-exposed rings to 10.30 +/- 5.00% from 38.40 +/- 6.90% (p<0.001). Cadmium also reduced the share of indomethacin 1.64% to 13.92 +/- 2.89% (p<0.01), which correlated well with the changes in the M1-mediated response (r=0.991, p<0.0001). Most of the deleterious effect of Cd appears to be restricted to the M1-dependent ACh response. These findings suggest that Cd produces an endothelial dysfunction by impairing the M1 type cholinoceptor mediated response, which seems to be involved in prostanoid release.", 
    "167": "Placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of several medications in the treatment of social anxiety disorder but information regarding their relative efficacy is lacking. We compared the efficacy of medications systematically studied for the treatment of social anxiety disorder using meta-analytic techniques. The methodology included a database search of articles published between January 1980 and June 2001 and manual searches of bibliographies in published manuscripts. Trials were included if they reported outcome data on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) or a categorical measure of responder status. Data were extracted independently by two authors. The Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity across trials. All analyses were conducted using intent-to-treat data. There was substantial heterogeneity across trials. The medications with largest effect sizes were phenelzine [effect size, 1.02; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.52-1.52], clonazepam (effect size, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.49-1.45), gabapentin (effect size, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.29-1.27), brofaromine (effect size, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.38-0.94), and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; effect size, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81). There were no statistically significant differences between medications or medication groups. However, formal methods of interim monitoring adapted for meta-analyses suggested strongest evidence of efficacy for SSRIs and brofaromine. Several medications are efficacious for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. The stability of the SSRI effect size estimate in conjunction with other evidence for safety and tolerability and their ability to treat comorbid conditions supports the use of SSRIs as the first-line treatment. Direct comparisons of SSRIs vs. other promising medications deserve consideration.",

Treatment patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic disorder. In comparison, SSRI use throughout the follow-up period has remained low. Patients using an SSRI did not have a more favorable clinical course than those using a benzodiazepine, nor were there significantly better rates of remission in patients using SSRIs and benzodiazepines concomitantly.",

Olanzapine-treated patients experienced a lower rate of treatment-emergent parkinsonism and akathisia but had significantly more weight gain, compared with the haloperidol-treated patients. Overall, significantly more olanzapine-treated subjects than haloperidol-treated subjects completed the 12-week acute phase of the study (67% versus 54%).", 
    "179": "As expected on the basis of previous studies, both olanzapine and haloperidol were effective in the acute reduction of psychopathological symptoms in this group of patients with first-episode psychosis. However, olanzapine had several relative advantages in therapeutic response. Although the nature of adverse events differed between the two agents, retention in the study was greater with olanzapine. Retention in treatment is important in this patient population, given their risk of relapse. Longer-term results are needed to determine whether treatment with atypical antipsychotics results in superior outcomes for a first episode of schizophrenia.", 
    "180": "The phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes have received substantial attention in the pharmacogenetic literature. Researchers are beginning to examine the role of the phase II UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, which produce products that are more water-soluble, less toxic and more readily excreted than the parent compounds. Several reasons may have contributed to neglect of UGTs (compared to CYPs) including: (1) the overlapping activity of UGTs and lack of selective probes; (2) the complexity of the glucuronidation cycle; and (3) the difficulty in developing analytic methods to measure glucuronides. Current CYP knowledge is used as a model to predict advances in UGT knowledge. At least 24 different UGT human genes have been identified and are classified in two families (UGT1 and UGT2) based on sequence homology. The UGT1A subfamily (genes located on chromosome 2) glucuronidates bilirubin, thyroid hormones, and some medications. UGT1A4 metabolizes tricyclic antidepressants and some antipsychotics. The UGT2B subfamily (genes located on chromosome 6) glucuronidates sexual steroids and bile acids. Oxazepam and lorazepam are mainly metabolized by glucuronidation. Anti-epileptics with mood-stabilizing properties are frequently metabolized by UGTs. Opioid and nicotine addiction may also be influenced by glucuronidation. Glucuronidation of serotonin may be important during fetal development. UGTs appear to be in small concentrations in brain tissue (and higher concentrations at brain capillaries). However, UGTs may be localized in certain brain areas to provide a neuroprotective function. This review illustrates the importance of glucuronidation and the implications for psychiatry.",

As a result, the required effect diminished very quickly. Prescriptions for Kavasporal forte showed that the daily dosage of 2 capsules per day complied with the recommendations in only 49.1% of the cases; in 38.8% of the cases, the dosage dropped below the respective recommendation. As a consequence, the lower-dosed Kavasporal forte was prescribed for longer periods than the higher-dosed Antares and Laitan.",

On the other hand, we saw a trend to under-dose in the case of a higher dosage recommendation. This fact may explain the unexpected inefficacy of the therapy. These trends affected the duration of therapy, whereby a dosage lower than the RDD was prescribed for a longer period than a dosage higher than the RDD.",

Among the most frequent reasons of insomnia one can mention the overuse of coffee, alcohol, smoking, using some drugs, stress, depression, neurosis, dementia, chronic diseases. Idiopathic insomnia constitutes less than 5% of cases. Before the treatment of insomnia is started, its cause should be found and it should be determined if it is transient or chronic. The treatment of insomnia can be based on pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy methods. Behavioural therapy is mentioned among non-pharmacotherapeutic methods. It aims at changing the sleep-related habits. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment (still mostly based on benzodiazepines) should not last longer than 2-3 weeks and drugs of short elimination T 1/2 (below 6 hours) should be used. Side-effects of this group of drugs should always be taken into consideration. It should be remembered that sleep disturbances can be symptoms of other diseases and their treatment cannot consist in prescribing hypnotics only.", 
    "187": "The study dealt with a popular drug diazepam also known as Relanium. Two doses of the substance were tested: 0.2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg. The experiment was carried out on 10-rabbit groups for two hours. The animals were observed in peaceful environment of the laboratory after one hour of adaptation. There were distinguished a few phases of behaviour: active and passive observation, comfort, tension, grooming, food and water intake. Both doses eliminated completely the tension phase. Changes in other phases were similar to each other but depending on the dose there were differences in strength and duration. The smaller dose caused significant prolongation of the comfort phase at the expense of active and passive observation time decrease during the first hour of observation. The second hour trends were not changed but lost their statistical relevance. The changes caused by the bigger dose were almost identical and they were statistically significant during both hours of the experiment, but their amplitude was stronger than that caused by the lower dose. The outcome of the experiment confirms anxiolytic, sedative and miorelaxant properties of diazepam.",

Clinical data for this retrospective study were gathered from records of consecutive patients treated for Jimsonweed poisoning from September to November 1997. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and Student t-test were used to analyze important clinical and sociodemographic variables. There were 17 victims of the Jimsonweed ingestion epidemic, all of whom presented with an anticholinergic toxidrome 3 to 9 hours after ingestion. Reported quantities of seed ingestion ranged from a low of 7 seeds to as high as 200 seeds. Altered mentation, manifested by combative behavior, necessitated admission of 13 patients to the ICU. The administration of physostigmine did not reduce admissions to the ICU (P = 0.54) or reduce length of stay in the hospital (P = 0.45) compared with the use of benzodiazepines alone. Nasogastric lavage was performed in 14 (82%) and seeds were recovered in 8 (57%) of those lavaged. The successful removal of Jimsonweed seeds did not decrease ICU use rates (P = 0.68) or shorten length of stay in the hospital compared with not recovering seeds (P = 0.85). The use of physostigmine and the successful nasogastric lavage of Jimsonweed seeds did not result in decreased intensive-care use or shorter length of stay in the hospital for Jimsonweed-induced anticholinergic toxicity.", 
    "189": "Thalamic high frequency bursts have long been described under anesthesia and during slow-wave sleep (SWS). More recently, studies in the lateral geniculate nucleus have pointed out that they are also present during waking (W). Here, we compared the bursts recorded in the medial geniculate body of guinea pigs under anesthesia or during periods of W and SWS. The tuning of single units was tested between threshold and 80 dB SPL in two conditions: (1) in restrained, undrugged, non-sleep-deprived guinea pigs (n=101 cells) and (2) under pentobarbital anesthesia (n=53 cells). Off-line analyses allowed us to distinguish single action potentials (APs) from bursts. A burst was defined as a group of APs with an interspike interval < or =4 ms, preceded by a silent period > or =100 ms. We found that auditory thalamus bursts occur in synchronized electroencephalogram states (SWS and anesthesia), but also during W. Although the burst characteristics did not differ among the three states, group data showed that the proportion of bursts within spike trains was the greatest under anesthesia. This observation resulted from two types of effects: (1) the percentage of non-bursting cells was lowest under anesthesia and (2) some cells under anesthesia exhibited up to 90% of bursts, whereas during W or SWS the highest proportion of bursts did not exceed 40%. The presence of these bursts is discussed with regards to the known fluctuations of membrane potential which occur in these various states.", 
    "190": "Psychiatric emergencies are a common cause for a call for the pre-clinical emergency physician (EP). However, previous studies reported serious problems in diagnosing and particularly treating these patients. Although evidence-based treatment guidelines and algorithms exist for the most important somatic disorders the EP has to deal with, they do not for psychiatric emergencies. It is the aim of this review, subsequent to an extensive overview on the available literature, to provide the reader with differentiated suggestions for pharmacological crisis intervention as well as with treatment recommendations for different psychiatric disorders with an emphasis on the special needs in the pre-clinical emergency medicine. After conducting a literature research from 1971 to 2002, 31 double-blind trials were found comparing different antipsychotics and benzodiazepines for efficacy and tolerability. Further, pharmacological data and product information of the most commonly used drugs were evaluated. Following, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were generally assessed for their usefulness in the pre-clinical emergency medicine, the advantages of different drugs for specific indications are presented and dosage recommendations are given. As an antipsychotic, haloperidol still is the drug of choice. Within the benzodiazepines, lorazepam seems to have advantages over diazepam. An antipsychotic medication is particularly indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, mania, drug-induced psychoses and delirium whereas benzodiazepines are favourable for the treatment of anxiety, restlessness and agitation due to neurotic or reactive circumstances. There is some evidence suggesting that newer generation, so-called \"atypical\" antipsychotics may play a role in the treatment of psychiatric emergencies, however, controlled trials are necessary to substantiate their potential benefits in the preclinical emergency medicine.", 
    "191": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of endogenous excitatory amino acid receptors in suckling- induced prolactin (PRL) elevation. Glutamate is known to be the dominant excitatory neurotransmitter and may act simultaneously on different glutamatergic receptor subtypes. MK-801 (dizocilpine) is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), while GyKI 52466 is an antagonist of the R,S-alpha-amino- 3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/ kainate receptor subtypes. Using the combination of the two receptorsubtype antagonists, we tested the hypothesis that parallel blockade of more than one subtype is more effective. Low-dose MK-801 (0.033 mg/kg) had no effect on suckling-induced PRL elevation after 4 h of separation. When injected alone, 10 mg/kg of GyKI 52466 was also ineffective, but in combination with low-dose MK-801 it efficiently diminished the sucklinginduced PRL elevation while lactation proceeded. The same dose of GyKI 52466 combined with 0.2 mg/kg of MK-801 (a combination that in other studies was able to block the foot-shock-induced PRL elevation) was more effective. Simultaneous blockade of the two ionotropic glutamate receptors with 0.2 mg/kg of MK-801 and 10 mg/kg of GyKI 52466 caused a decline in plasma PRL concentration of continuously suckling mothers. We conclude that the endogenous glutamatergic system has an important role in suckling-induced PRL elevation and in the maintenance of constantly high PRL levels in lactating mothers. Furthermore, the NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor subtypes can interact with each other in this process.", 
    "192": "Neurons were obtained from the CA1 region of the hippocampus of newborn rats and maintained in culture. Channels were activated by pentobarbitone in cell-attached, inside-out or outside-out patches, normally by applying pentobarbitone in flowing bath solution. Currents were outwardly rectifying and blocked by bicuculline, properties of GABAA channels in these cells. Maximum channel conductance increased as pentobarbitone concentration was increased to 500 microM but conductance then decreased as pentobarbitone concentration was raised further. The best fit of a Hill-type equation to the relationship between maximum channel conductance and pentobarbitone concentration (up to 500 microM) gave an EC50 of 41 microM, a maximum conductance of 36 pS and a Hill coefficient of 1.6. Bicuculline decreased the maximum conductance of the channels activated by pentobarbitone, with an IC50 of 224 microM. Diazepam increased channel conductance, with a maximum effect being obtained with 1 microM diazepam. Diazepam (1 microM) decreased the EC50 of the pentobarbitone effect on channel conductance from 41 microM to 7.2 microM and increased maximum conductance to 72 pS. We conclude that GABAA channel conductance is related to the concentration of the allosteric agonist pentobarbitone.",

    "194": "This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patient presentations to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Emergency Department over a six-month period (November 2000 to April 2001).", 
    "195": "During the six-month study period, 42 patients presented to the ED after naltrexone-accelerated detoxification. This represented 7% of patients treated at a single clinic over the same period. Presentation occurred within 24 hours in 40% of cases and within 48 hours in 74%. Clinical features on presentation included gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (vomiting, 60%; abdominal pain, 55%; diarrhea, 45%), central nervous system [CNS] symptoms (excessive drowsiness, 55%; agitation requiring sedation, 50%), and respiratory symptoms (tachypnea, 33%; respiratory difficulties, 19%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were managed adequately with supportive therapy in most cases (intravenous fluids; antiemetics). Agitation sometimes required large doses of intravenous benzodiazepines (up to 730 mg in 44 hours), one-to-one nursing, and security staff. Two of 14 patients presenting with predominantly CNS disturbance required intubation (14%). Mean in-hospital stay for all patients was 18 hours (range 1 to 92 hours).", 
    "196": "A few patients undergoing outpatient naltrexone-accelerated detoxification during a six-month period subsequently required ED management. The clinical features encountered in this group of patients can be subdivided into GI or CNS predominance, with different management strategies. Most presentations can be managed in the ED or an associated observation ward, but departmental resources must be available for one-to-one nursing and security personnel. Patients presenting with agitation should be sedated with benzodiazepines; large doses may be required. Close monitoring of respiratory function is mandatory, and advanced airway management may be required.", 
    "197": "Because extracts of kudzu have been used as a hangover remedy in China for many centuries, we tested the ability of NPI-031G (puerarin), an isoflavone isolated from kudzu, to counteract anxiogenic effects associated with withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. NPI-O31G (50 and 150 mg/kg ip) significantly increased the social interaction and locomotor activity reduced by withdrawal from 17 days of alcohol (7%) diet. The effects of NPI-031G resembled those of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (5 mg/kg), and the 5-HT(2C) antagonist, SB 242084 (1 mg/kg). In a separate study, control rats were pretreated with NPI-031G (30 min) and then given the anxiogenic compounds DMCM, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, or Ro 600175, a 5-HT(2C) agonist. NPI-031G significantly counteracted the reduction in social interaction induced by either compound. To identify a potential mechanism of action of NPI-031G, synaptoneurosomes were isolated from the cerebral cortex of untreated rats and chloride uptake assays were carried out. NPI-031G did not have any effect on the stimulation of chloride uptake by muscimol, a GABA(A) agonist. However, it reduced the potentiation of muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake by flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist, at a concentration of 100 microM. A reduction in [3H]flunitrazepam binding was also seen at this concentration. These findings are consistent with NPI-031G being a weak benzodiazepine site antagonist.", 
    "198": "Valerian is an ancient tranquillizing drug obtained from the underground organs of several Valeriana species. Its active principles were assumed to be terpenoids in the form of valepotriates and/or as components of the essential oil. However, unknown active compounds were not discarded and synergic effects were suspected. We have recently isolated 6-methylapigenin (MA) from Valeriana wallichii and proved that it is a benzodiazepine binding site (BDZ-bs) ligand [Planta Med. 68 (2002) 934]. The present paper is the first report of the presence of 2S(-)-hesperidin in valeriana and describes that it has sedative and sleep-enhancing properties. MA, in turn, was found to have anxiolytic properties and was able to potentiate the sleep-enhancing properties of hesperidin (HN).MA and HN are new members of the growing family of natural flavonoids with activity on the CNS, and their properties suggest that they are promising drug leads in the field."
