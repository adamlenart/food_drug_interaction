These databases were searched using the algorithm recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. References cited in the identified articles and other relevant literature were screened. Randomized and/or double-blinded controlled trials, involving patients diagnosed with nonspecific low back pain, treated with muscle relaxants as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic methods, were included for review. Two reviewers independently carried out the methodologic quality assessment and data extraction of the trials. The analysis comprised not only a quantitative analysis (statistical pooling) but also a qualitative analysis (\"best evidence synthesis\"). This involved the appraisal of the strength of evidence for various conclusions using a rating system based on the quality and outcomes of the studies included. Evidence was classified as \"strong,\" \"moderate,\" \"limited,\" \"conflicting,\" or \"no\" evidence.",

Four trials studied benzodiazepines, 11 nonbenzodiazepines, and 2 antispasticity muscle relaxants in comparison with placebo. Results showed that there is strong evidence that any of these muscle relaxants are more effective than placebo for patients with acute low back pain on short-term pain relief. The pooled relative risk for nonbenzodiazepines versus placebo after 2 to 4 days was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 0.89) for pain relief and 0.49 (95% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.95) for global efficacy. Adverse events, however, with a relative risk of 1.50 (95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 1.98) were significantly more prevalent in patients receiving muscle relaxants and especially the central nervous system adverse effects (relative risk 2.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.23 to 3.37).

In electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), its use is limited because of its seizure-shortening effects, and is recommended only for patients with preexisting cardiac conditions requiring attenuated hemodynamic response during treatment. We have identified two additional significant indications for propofol: to induce shorter seizures in patients with prolonged seizures and to minimize post-ictal nausea and vomiting.",

Nine patients had seizures longer than 180 seconds requiring termination with a benzodiazepine. The switch resulted in an average shortening of the EEG recorded seizures by 38.7%. Eight of the 22 (36.4%) patients were adolescents. These 8 comprised 53% of the total of 15 adolescents treated with ECT in our service. Five of the 15 (33%) had seizures longer than 180 seconds.

    "14": "The objective of this study was to get an insight into the prevalence of medicinal and illegal drugs among car drivers in a Danish rural area. The police randomly stopped about 1000 car drivers and asked them to deliver a saliva sample and gave them a questionnaire to fill in at home. Laboratory analyses by specific methods of samples, which a screening found positive, confirmed that 2% were positive for benzodiazepines or illegal drugs (amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine or opiates): 1.3% were positive for illegal drugs and 0.7% for benzodiazepines. Questionnaire statements from some of the drivers confirm that occasionally some of these drive despite a suspicion to be under the influence of an illegal drug (2.8%), an illegal drug including alcohol (4%), a hazardous medicinal drug including alcohol (8.5%), or alcohol alone above the legal limit (24.5%). These results are considered reliable for the survey area and may not reflect national conditions. The overall results indicate that in this study driving under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol seems to be associated to especially men, aged 22-44 years. Driving under the influence of hazardous medicinal drugs seems to be associated to middle-aged/elderly drivers, both men and women.",

    "16": "The success of cortical resection for intractable epilepsy of neocortical origin is highly dependent on the accurate presurgical delineation of the regions responsible for generating seizures. In addition to EEG and structural imaging studies, functional neuroimaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) can assist lateralization and localization of epileptogenic cortical areas. In the presented studies, objectively delineated focal PET abnormalities have been analyzed in patients (mostly children) with intractable epilepsy, using two different tracers: 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), that measures regional brain glucose metabolism, and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ), that binds to GABAA receptors. The PET abnormalities were correlated with scalp and intracranial EEG findings, structural brain abnormalities, as well as surgical outcome data. In patients with extratemporal foci and no lesion on MRI, FMZ PET was more sensitive than FDG PET for identification of the seizure onset zone defined by intracranial EEG monitoring. In contrast, seizures commonly originated from the border of hypometabolic cortex detected by FDG PET suggesting that such areas are most likely epileptogenic, and should be addressed if subdural EEG is applied to delineate epileptic cortex. In patients with cortical lesions, perilesional cortex with decreased FMZ binding was significantly smaller than corresponding areas of glucose hypometabolism, and correlated well with spiking cortex. Extent of perilesional hypometabolism, on the other hand, showed a correlation with the life-time number of seizures suggesting a seizure-related progression of brain dysfunction. FMZ PET proved to be also very sensitive for detection of dual pathology (coexistence of an epileptogenic cortical lesion and hippocampal sclerosis). This has a major clinical importance since resection of both the cortical lesion and the atrophic hippocampus is required to achieve optimal surgical results. Finally, the author demonstrated that in patients with neocortical epilepsy, FDG PET abnormalities correctly regionalize the epileptogenic area, but their size is not related to the extent of epileptogenic tissue to be removed. In contrast, complete resection of cortex with decreased FMZ binding predicts good surgical outcome suggesting that application of FMZ PET can improve surgical results in selected patients with intractable epilepsy of neocortical origin.", 
    "17": "The experiments showed that sequential drug discriminations can be learned and retained under a fixed-interval (FI) schedule for more than 18 months without additional training under a complex three-choice procedure. Pigeons were trained to discriminate among 5 mg/kg pentobarbital, 2 mg/kg D-amphetamine, and saline. After responding stabilized, dose-response curves were determined for other drugs. Subsequently, pentobarbital was replaced with 5 mg/kg morphine as a training drug, and D-amphetamine was replaced with 30 mg/kg caffeine. After the pigeons learned these new discriminations, dose-response curves were redetermined. Initially, chlordiazepoxide substituted for pentobarbital, cocaine substituted for D-amphetamine, and nicotine partially substituted for D-amphetamine. Morphine, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and caffeine did not substitute for either drug. After retraining with morphine and caffeine, responding occurred on the pentobarbital/morphine key after pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide and morphine and on the D-amphetamine/caffeine key after D-amphetamine, cocaine and caffeine. After nicotine and Delta9-tetrahyrdocannabinol, responding occurred on the saline key. These data show that drug discriminations learned under fixed-interval schedules are retained for long time periods, even when discrimination training with other drugs occurs during the retention period.", 
    "18": "Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are among the most frequently used class of psychotropic drugs employed in veterinary medicine in Brazil and worldwide due to their anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects [J. Clin. Pharmacol. 33 (1993) 124]. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) sites were described in peripheral organs, endocrine steroidogenic tissues and immune organs and cells. Midazolam is a mixed-type agonist of PBRs. The present study is focused on the effects of midazolam on equine peripheral blood neutrophils, peritoneal macrophages and cortisol levels in plasma. Adult horses were treated with a single dose of midazolam (0.06 or 0.1 mg/kg) or with 0.9% NaCl. Immune cells were collected 24 h after treatment for flow cytometry analysis of Staphylococcus aureus-induced phagocytosis and oxidative burst. Plasma cortisol concentration was measured 30, 90, 180 and 360 min after midazolam treatment. Midazolam induced a dose-dependent reduction on: (1) peripheral blood neutrophil and peritoneal macrophage oxidative burst; (2) the capacity of both peripheral blood neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages to phagocyte S. aureus. Increments on plasma cortisol concentration were not found after 0.06 and 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam. The effects on oxidative burst of neutrophils and macrophages from horses treated with midazolam were interpreted as a consequence of an impairment of S. aureus-induced phagocytosis. The present data suggest that midazolam, most probably acting on PBRs present on equine macrophage and neutrophil membranes, might have changed some mechanisms related to both phagocytosis and oxidative burst. These results support the use of flow cytometry to identify functional properties and dysfunction of equine immune cells. They also confirm the notion that changes in the functional capacity of the immune system may represent an important hazard of exposure to drugs or chemicals.",

The patients were randomly allocated to receive 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally either alone or with 1 mg of midazolam using a combined spinal epidural technique. The duration and quality of sensory and motor block, perioperative analgesia, haemodynamic changes, and sedation levels were assessed.", 
    "21": "The duration of sensory block (i.e. time to regression to the S2 segment) was significantly longer in the midazolam group than the control group (218 min vs. 165 min; P < 0.001). The duration of motor block was also prolonged in the midazolam group as compared with the control group (P < 0.01). In 90% of the patients in the midazolam group, the quality of block was adequate during the intra-operative period as compared with only 65% of the patients in the control group (P < 0.05). The duration of effective analgesia was longer in the midazolam group than in the control group (199 vs. 103 min; P < 0.001).

Although the incidence of respiratory depression was higher in patients receiving deep sedation with propofol than in patients who were lightly sedated (17.6% versus 12.5%, respectively), all six patients who had respiratory depression while under deep sedation with propofol were successfully ventilated using the LMA trade mark, without the need to remove the TEE probe and without terminating the examination prematurely. In contrast, in the one patient in the light sedation group who had respiratory depression, the TEE probe had to be removed to ventilate the patient via a face mask, and the procedure was cancelled.", 
    "29": "It has been hypothesized that alcohol addiction is mediated, at least in part, by specific gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors within the ventral pallidum (VP). Among the potential GABA(A) receptor isoforms regulating alcohol-seeking behaviors within the VP, the GABA(A) alpha1 receptor subtype (GABA(A1)) appears pre-eminent. In the present study, we developed beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (betaCCt), a mixed agonist-antagonist benzodiazepine (BDZ) site ligand, with binding selectivity at the A1 receptor to explore the functional role of VP(A1) receptors in the euphoric properties of alcohol. The in vivo actions of betaCCt were then determined following microinfusion into the VP, a novel alcohol reward substrate that primarily expresses the A1 receptor. In two selectively bred rodent models of chronic alcohol drinking (HAD-1, P rats), bilateral microinfusion of betaCCt (0.5-40 microg) produced marked reductions in alcohol-reinforced behaviors. Further, VP infusions of betaCCt exhibited both neuroanatomical and reinforcer specificity. Thus, no effects on alcohol-reinforced behaviors were observed following infusion in the nucleus accumbens (NACC)/caudate putamen (CPu), or on response maintained by saccharin. Parenteral-administered betaCCt (1-40 mg/kg) was equally effective and selective in reducing alcohol-reinforced behaviors in P and HAD-1 rats. Additional tests of locomotor activity revealed that betaCCt reversed the locomotor sedation produced by both chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) and EtOH (1.25 g/kg), but was devoid of intrinsic effects when given alone. Studies in recombinant receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed that betaCCt acted as a low-efficacy partial agonist at alpha3beta3gamma2 and alpha4beta3gamma2 receptors and as a low-efficacy inverse agonist at alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, and alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors. The present study indicates that betaCCt is capable of antagonizing the reinforcing and the sedative properties of alcohol. These anti-alcohol properties of betaCCt are primarily mediated via the GABA(A1) receptor. betaCCt may represent a prototype of a pharmacotherapeutic agent to effectively reduce alcohol drinking behavior in human alcoholics.", 
    "30": "The relative susceptibility of intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A to induction by rifampin (INN, rifampicin), as a function of age and sex, was investigated with the CYP3A substrate midazolam.", 
    "31": "Fourteen young women (mean age, 26 +/- 4 years), 14 young men (mean age, 27 +/- 4 years), 14 elderly women (mean age, 72 +/- 5 years), and 10 elderly men (mean age, 70 +/- 4 years) received simultaneous intravenous doses (0.05 mg/kg over a 30-minute period) and oral doses of midazolam (3-8 mg of a stable isotope, (15)N(3)-midazolam) before and after 7 days of rifampin dosing (600 mg once daily in the evening). Serum and urine samples were assayed for midazolam, (15)N(3)-midazolam, and metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.", 
    "32": "No significant difference (P > or =.05) in the baseline systemic and oral clearance of midazolam was observed between male and female or young and old volunteers. Rifampin significantly (P <.0001) increased the systemic and oral clearance of midazolam from 0.44 +/- 0.2 L. h/kg and 1.56 +/- 0.8 L x h/kg to 0.96 +/- 0.3 L x h/kg and 34.4 +/- 21.2 L x h/kg, respectively. Likewise, the oral clearance of midazolam was significantly (P <.0001) increased in women and men, from 1.64 +/- 0.87 L x kg/h and 1.46 +/- 0.7 L x kg/h to 28.4 +/- 13.2 L x kg/h and 41.6 +/- 26.5 L x kg/h, respectively. A significant (P =.0023) effect of sex was noted in the extent of induction of the oral clearance of midazolam, being greater in men than in women. In contrast, the extent of midazolam systemic clearance induction was greater in women than in men (P =.0107). Age did not influence the extent of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A induction as determined by the oral and systemic clearance of midazolam. Rifampin dosing significantly (P <.0001) reduced the oral availability by 88%, from 0.32 +/- 0.13 to 0.04 +/- 0.02. Correspondingly, hepatic and intestinal availabilities were significantly (P <.0001) reduced after rifampin administration. After rifampin, the correlation coefficient for the relationship between oral availability and intestinal availability was significantly (P <.0001) reduced from 0.96 to 0.67, which reflects the increasing contribution of hepatic extraction to the determination of midazolam oral availability. A significant nonlinear inverse relationship was observed between the percent change in systemic clearance of midazolam and the initial baseline midazolam systemic clearance (r = -0.68, N = 52, P <.0001). Likewise, a significant inverse relationship was observed between the percent change in oral clearance and the baseline oral clearance (r = -0.39, N = 52, P =.0041). A significant inverse relationship between the ratio of hepatic intrinsic clearance in the presence of rifampin to that in the absence of rifampin and the corresponding ratio of intestinal intrinsic clearance was observed (Spearman correlation coefficient [r] = -0.68, P <.0001) and indicates that in a given individual the extent of induction was high at either the hepatic or the intestinal site but not both.", 
    "33": "Sex-related differences exist in the extent of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A induction by rifampin. The extent of induction at hepatic and intestinal sites was inversely dependent and reflected the independent regulation of CYP3A expression at these sites. The large interindividual variation in the extent of induction is explained in part by the variation in baseline expression of CYP3A. Sex-related differences in response to CYP3A inducers will be substrate-dependent and reflect the relative contribution of hepatic and intestinal sites of metabolism.", 
    "34": "Spinally administered muscarinic receptor agonists or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors produce effective pain relief. Intrathecal injection of a small dose of neostigmine produces a profound antiallodynic effect in rats with diabetic neuropathy. However, the mechanisms of increased antinociceptive effect of cholinergic agents on diabetic neuropathic pain are not clear. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that spinal muscarinic receptors are up-regulated in diabetes. The withdrawal threshold of the hindpaw in response to noxious heat and pressure stimuli was determined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic and age-matched normal rats. Muscarine-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding was used to assess the change of functional muscarinic receptors in the spinal cord in diabetes. The [3H]AF-DX 384 membrane binding was performed to determine the number and affinity of spinal cord M2 muscarinic receptors in normal and diabetic rats. We found that the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal 2 to 12 mug muscarine in diabetic animals was potentiated significantly compared with that in normal animals. The maximal muscarine-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was 112.5 +/- 8.3% in normal rats and 168.8 +/- 12.1% (P < 0.05) in diabetic rats. Although the KD value (2.9 nM) was similar in both groups, the Bmax of [3H]AF-DX 384 membrane binding was significantly higher in diabetic than in normal rats (255.2 +/- 5.9 versus 165.9 +/- 3.5 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.05). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the muscarinic receptor is up-regulated in the dorsal spinal cord in diabetic rats. This finding probably accounts for the increased efficacy of the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal muscarinic agonists in diabetic neuropathic pain.",

    "36": "Risk and exposure data were obtained from the Dutch Pharmo system, a population-based register of drug-dispensing records and hospital records. The population attributable risk (PAR) was calculated using the age-specific prevalence estimates of benzodiazepine use and the corresponding relative risk (RR), obtained from a case-control study in community-dwelling inhabitants over 55 years of age in defined areas of The Netherlands covering the period 1985-2000. Annual hospitalisation costs of benzodiazepine-related fall injuries were based on the age-specific PARs and extrapolated to the European population using accident and demographic data of the EU. All analyses were performed from the perspective of a third-party payer.", 
    "37": "Fall injuries in the study population were significantly associated with benzodiazepine use (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.7), especially in those aged over 85 years (RR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5). The total annual hospital direct medical costs in 2000 of fall-related injuries attributable to benzodiazepine use were Euro 1.8 billion (95% CI Euro 1.5-2.2 billion) in the EU.", 
    "38": "The estimated costs of hospitalisations of accidental-fall injuries related to benzodiazepine use in the EU varied between Euro 1.5 and Euro 2.2 billion each year. More than 90% of these costs were in the elderly, with hip fractures as the major contributor. Discontinuing benzodiazepines in the elderly and/or substituting them with other drugs not associated with the risk of falls in the elderly will to a large extent prevent these accidents.", 
    "39": "The effects of two anxiolytic drugs, diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and afobazole (20 mg/kg, i.p.) on the EEG features was studied in MR and MNRA rats with different emotionality and anxiety levels in order to reveal an EEG marker of the anxiolytic action. For this purpose, 840 EEG parameters from 24 neocortex sites were determined and analyzed. In MR (but not in MNRA) rats, both diazepam and afobazole decreased the number of EEG parameters reliably changed upon the emotional-pain stress related to the intraperitoneal injections of 0.9% NaCl. Afobazole increased the theta-rhythm power in the spectral band of 4.75-7.25 Hz in MR rats, and in the band of 4.75-5.75 Hz in MNRA rats. Diazepam did not change the theta activity in MR rats, while decreasing it in the band of 6.00-7.25 Hz for MNRA rats. In addition, diazepam increased the spectral power in a broad frequency range of alpha and beta rhythms (8.75-17.25 Hz) in the rats of both lines, while afobazole did not produce such action. Common effects include a decrease in the spectral power within a narrow frequency band (7.5-8.5 Hz) at the boundary between theta and alpha regions. It is suggested that the latter effect can be used as the EEG marker of the anxiolytic action. The biopotential coherency in this frequency band was reduced in MR and MNRA rats only under the action of afobazole. The possibility of EEG changes related to the side action of anxiolytics and expediency of using the EEG markers in rats with different emotionality levels are discussed.", 
    "40": "Although the modern concept of neuroprotection has been formulated quite recently, the basis of this approach was laid about four decades ago when Zakusov initiated the study of mechanisms involved in the neuroprotector action of GABA shunt metabolites (in particular, alpha-hydroxybutyric acid and succinic semialdehyde) during hypoxia. It was suggested to consider these agents as a system of endogenous neuroprotectors. The interest of Zakusov in endogenous regulators (including oligopeptides) had stimulated research in this direction and gave impact to the investigations of A. P. Skoldinov and T. A. Gudasheva initiated in the early 1980s. Proceeding from the original concept of the possibility of imitation of the action of neurotropic agents by their structural-conformational oligopeptide analogs, a number of biologically active stable dipeptides were obtained, based on pyroglutamate and proline, and high specific bioaccessibility of these dipeptides for the brain was established. Our investigations showed that these compounds not only possess nootropic activity (in a dose 1000 times lower than that of piracetam), but produce a pronounced neuroprotector action as well. Most thoroughly studied in this respect were substituted acyl-prolyl dipeptides, in particular, the drug noopept exhibiting a combined neuroprotector effect both in vitro and in vivo. Noopept decreases the extent of necrotic damage caused by photoinduced thrombosis of cortical blood vessels. It was established that the neuroprotector effect of noopept is related to its action upon the well-known \"triad\", whereby the drug reduces neurotoxic effects of excess extracellular calcium, glutamate, and free radicals. Two additional components of the neuroprotector action of noopept are related to the antiinflammatory and antithrombotic activity. The prospects of using direct and indirect action upon neurotrophin system for neuroprotection purposes are considered. Taking into account common secondary mechanisms of the neuronal damage, it is possible to provide for pleotrophic brain protection with dipeptides in a broad spectrum of pathological states, including strokes, cerebral traumas, neurodegenerative processes, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.", 
    "41": "The effect of the cholinomimetic agent, bethanechol on macroscopic membrane currents was studied in dispersed cat atrial myocytes, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Bethanechol activated an inward rectifying potassium current similar to I(K(ACh)), and a delayed rectifying-like outward current, similar to I(KM3) activated by pilocarpine, choline, and tetramethylammonium, and I(KM4) activated by 4-aminopyridine. The relatively specific muscarinic receptors subtype antagonists methoctramine (M(2)), and tropicamide (M(4)) inhibited both current components induced by bethanechol, suggesting a lack of specificity of these antagonists on cat atrial myocytes. The specific antagonist of M(3) receptors, para-fluoro-hexahydro-siladifenidol did not significantly inhibit the bethanechol-induced currents. In addition, pretreatment with PTX prevented activation of the bethanechol-induced inward and outward currents, suggesting that M(3) receptors are probably not involved in the bethanechol action. The I(K(ACh)) specific blocker tertiapin inhibited both inward rectifying- and delayed rectifying-like currents. These results suggest that both current components result from activation of a single channel type, likely I(K(ACh)).",

The spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were significantly reduced by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (20 microM), but were not affected by the glycine antagonist strychnine (1 microM). The frequency, amplitude, and decay time constant of sIPSCs were 4.3 +/- 0.9 Hz, 18.1 +/- 2.0 pA and 8.9 +/- 0.4 ms, respectively. The specific AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-52466 (50 microM) completely blocked the non-NMDA-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), indicating that they are mediated by an AMPA-preferring receptor. The AMPA-mediated sEPSCs were characterized by low frequency (1.5 +/- 0.4 Hz), small amplitude (13.9 +/- 1.9 pA) and rapid decay kinetics (2.8 +/- 0.2 ms). The majority (15/21) displayed linear I-V relationships, suggesting the presence of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors.",

Fifty-four (70%) of the victims were male, often killed by an acquaintance during a fight. Almost 70% of the female victims were killed in their own home, whereas that was the case for only 30% of the male victims. The majority of the victims (of both sexes) had been hit in more than 1 region of the body. A female offender was encountered in 4 instances; none of their victims were children. Of the 3 children in the blunt force victim group, 2 were battered children. Many of the victims with a blood alcohol level of 0 turned out to have lived for some time after the injury.",

    "50": "Cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane is the rate-determining step in steroid and bile acid biosyntheses. Biochemical, pharmacological and molecular studies have demonstrated that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a five transmembrane domain mitochondrial protein involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport. PBR gene disruption in Leydig cells completely blocked cholesterol transport into mitochondria and steroid formation, while PBR expression in bacteria, devoid of endogenous PBR and cholesterol, induced cholesterol uptake and transport. Molecular modeling of PBR suggested that cholesterol might cross the membrane through the five helices of the receptor and that synthetic and endogenous ligands might bind to common sites in the cytoplasmic loops. A cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) sequence in the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus of the PBR was identified by mutagenesis studies. In vitro reconstitution of PBR into proteoliposomes demonstrated that PBR binds both drug ligands and cholesterol with high affinity. In vivo polymeric forms of PBR were observed and polymer formation was reproduced in vitro, using recombinant PBR protein reconstituted into proteoliposomes, associated with an increase in drug ligand binding and reduction of cholesterol-binding capacity. This suggests that the various polymeric states of PBR might be part of a cycle mediating cholesterol uptake and release into the mitochondria, with PBR functioning as a cholesterol exchanger against steroid product(s) arising from cytochrome P450 action. Taking into account the widespread presence of PBR in many tissues, a more general role of PBR in intracellular cholesterol transport and compartmentalization might be considered.", 
    "51": "Ethanol and cocaine are frequently abused in combination, but little is known about how the subjective effects of the two drugs interact. The ability of ethanol and other GABA(A)-active compounds to alter the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine was tested. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate cocaine (10 mg/kg ip) from saline using either single- or cumulative-dosing methods. In single-dose testing, ethanol (0.1-0.5 g/kg) dose-dependently decreased cocaine-appropriate responding following the training dose of cocaine. Ethanol (0.5 g/kg) produced a rightward shift in the cocaine cumulative dose-effect curve. Ethanol (0.1-1.0 g/kg) failed to substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine and the higher doses (1-2 g/kg) completely suppressed responding. Indirect GABA(A) agonists diazepam (benzodiazepine site) and pentobarbital (barbiturate site) did not block the discriminative stimulus effects of cumulative doses of cocaine. The GABA(A) antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (10-40 mg/kg) did not substitute for cocaine. These findings suggest that ethanol can modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine, and that these effects may not be mediated by the actions of ethanol at the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "52": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the aqueous extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge (danshen in Chinese) on the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and on liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme activity in rats. Rats (n = 5) were pretreated with danshen extract (100 mg kg(-1) per day, p.o.) for 15 consecutive days. Control rats (n = 5) received saline at the same time. Each rat was then administered a single oral dose of 15 mg kg(-1) diazepam. The pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam were significantly different between the two groups. In the danshen pretreated group, the maximum concentration of diazepam and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were reduced to about 72.7% and 44.4%, respectively, while the total body clearance was markedly increased by 2-fold. To help explain the results, liver microsomal suspensions were obtained from rats that were randomly divided into the control group (n = 10), and the low- (20 mg kg(-1) for 15 days, p.o., n = 10) and high-dose groups (100 mg kg(-1) for 15 days, p.o., n = 10) pretreated with danshen extract. Compared with the control rats, the microsomal protein content, cytochrome P450 enzyme level and erythromycin N-demethylase activity of pretreated rats were significantly increased. These results indicate that danshen extract can stimulate the activity of cytochrome P450 isoforms, and changes in the pharmacokinetics of diazepam resulting from danshen extract are related to an increase in metabolic activity of cytochrome P450.",

Oleamide, in the dose range 43.7-700.0 mg kg(-1), significantly and dose-dependently inhibited the seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. However, oleamide showed no inhibitory action on the seizures induced by picrotoxin, strychnine, caffeine or semicarbazide. These results provide the first evidence for the anti-seizure effect of oleamide, and suggest that this effect may be selective to the seizure model induced by pentylenetetrazole.", 
    "54": "The goal of this study was to determine whether a new internal bioartificial liver utilizing porcine hepatocytes can perform detoxification and other metabolic functions. Such a system might aid in treating patients with moderate to severe liver failure and prolong patient survival until a matching organ is found for transplantation. Porcine hepatocytes were attached to a microcarrier and an internal artificial liver was constructed by perfusing the hepatocytes into a polysulfon hollow fiber. The 4 experimental groups were: (a) control group, (b) microcarrier group, (c) hollow fiber group, and (d) internal bioartificial liver group. Viability of hepatocytes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) activities in the medium, urea production, diazepam transformation, protein synthesis, and glucose-6-phosphatase activity of cells were monitored during a 7-day culture period. Viability of porcine hepatocytes in the internal bioartificial liver group was maintained at >80% during the culture period, and alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase activities did not fluctuate significantly. These enzyme activities were significantly lower in the internal bioartificial liver group than in the control or microcarrier groups. Urea production, diazepam transformation, [3H]-leucine incorporation, and glucose-6-phosphatase activity were significantly higher in the internal bioartificial liver group than in the control and hollow fiber groups. These results show that the new internal bioartificial liver produces small amounts of ALT and LD and exhibits detoxification and protein synthetic functions.",

Specific, high affinity (affinity constant, Kd = 57.7 8.6 nM) binding sites for 3H-flunitrazepam on mouse brain membranes were identified. All benzodiazepine drugs inhibited 3H-flunitrazepam binding with nanomolar potencies. In contrast to benzodiazepines, all ergot drugs, GABA and thiopental produced an enhancement of 3H-flunitrazepam binding to its binding site at the GABAA receptor of the mouse brain. The rank order of potency was: neurotransmitter (GABA) > dihydroergotoxine > thiopental > alpha-dihydroergocriptine > dihydroergosine > dihydroergotamine. The results suggest that dihydrogenated ergot derivatives do not bind to the brain benzodiazepine binding sites labeled with 3H-flunitrazepam. However, an enhancement of 3H-flunitrazepam binding by all ergot drugs tested, clearly identifies an allosteric interaction with the benzodiazepine binding sites of GABAA receptors.",

These noncognitive problems lead to potentially devastating disabilities, and are often a major cause of stress, anxiety and concern for caregivers. Psychotropic drugs are frequently used to control these symptoms, but they have the potential for significant side effects, such as sedation, disinhibition, depression, falls, incontinence, parkinsonisms and akathisias. For 24 months, we monitored 68 outpatients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontal lobe dementia, Parkinson dementia complex, and Lewy body disease.

    "57": "An automated chip-based infusion nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) platform was used to demonstrate reproducible quantitation of drug molecules from biological matrices. Three sample preparation strategies were explored including protein precipitation of plasma with acetonitrile, de-salting of the plasma, and a combination of protein precipitation with subsequent de-salting of the dried and reconstituted extract. The best results were obtained when fortified human plasma samples containing midazolam were precipitated with acetonitrile containing alprazolam as the internal standard (IS). The supernatant was concentrated to dryness, reconstituted in aqueous acid, and de-salted by automated reversed-phase solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to infusion nanoESI-MS/MS. Analyses employed a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Each sample was infused for approximately 10 s and the resulting ion current profiles were integrated. Area ratios were used for regression analysis of standard samples (1.5-500 ng/mL). Quality control samples (3, 250, and 400 ng/mL) in five replicates from three different analysis days demonstrated intra-assay precision (< or =16%), inter-assay precision (< or =5%), and overall accuracy (+/-9% deviation). Infusion reproducibility of the assay was established by analyzing extracts after storage for 24 h at ambient temperature. Control plasma samples from six different sources probed the potential utility of this technique for the analysis of clinical samples. At the lower limit of quantitation (LLQ), variability and mean overall accuracy were < or =13% CV and +/-3% deviation, respectively, while at the upper limit of quantitation (ULQ) variability and mean overall accuracy were < or =9% CV and +/-9% deviation, respectively. Inter-chip variability was established by determining standard sample extracts across five different chips (< or =12% CV). Throughput for the assay was 55 s per sample, although this time may be shortened to 40 s per sample with recent improvements in the automated nanoESI system. No contamination or carryover was observed using this promising automated nanoESI-MS/MS platform.",

    "63": "Repeated withdrawals from chronic ethanol sensitize the withdrawal-induced reduction in social interaction behaviors. This study determined whether stress might substitute for repeated withdrawals to facilitate withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. When two 1-h periods of restraint stress were applied at 1-week intervals to rats fed control diet, social interaction was reduced upon withdrawal from a subsequent 5-day exposure to ethanol diet. Neither this ethanol exposure alone nor exposure to three restraint stresses alone altered this measure of anxiety. Further, the repeatedly stressed singly withdrawn rats continued to exhibit a reduction in social interaction 16 days later, upon withdrawal from re-exposure to 5 days of chronic ethanol, consistent with a persistent adaptation by the multiple-stress/withdrawal protocol. Weekly administration of corticosterone in place of stress induced no significant change in social interaction upon withdrawal from the single chronic ethanol exposure, indicative that corticoid release is not responsible for the stress-induced reduction in anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal. In the multiple-withdrawal protocol, stress applied during withdrawal from voluntary ethanol drinking by P-rats facilitated ethanol drinking sufficiently, to induce a withdrawal-induced reduction in social interaction. Administration of a CRF-1 receptor antagonist, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, or a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist prior to each stress minimized sensitization of the withdrawal-induced reduction in anxiety-like behavior. Since these pharmacological consequences on the induction of anxiety-like behavior following the stress/withdrawal protocol are like those previously seen when these drug treatments were given prior to multiple withdrawals, evidence is provided that repeated stresses and multiple withdrawals sensitize the withdrawal reduction in social interaction by similar central adaptive mechanisms.", 
    "64": "Consumption of typical quantities of grapefruit juice (GFJ) increases the oral bioavailability of several CYP3A4 substrates without affecting their elimination, consistent with selective inhibition of intestinal but not hepatic CYP3A4. However, increases in the AUCs of CYP3A4 substrates recently associated with the consumption of large amounts of GFJ were similar to those observed with potent inhibitors of hepatic CYP3A4. The current study compared the effects of consuming large quantities and more typical amounts of GFJ on the activity of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 in vivo, employing the erythromycin breath test (EBT) and oral midazolam pharmacokinetics. This was a two-phase, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, with each phase conducted with a separate panel of subjects. In Phase I, 8 male volunteers were randomized to the order of receiving one glass (240 mL) of water (placebo) or double-strength (DS) GFJ tid for 2 days and then 90, 60, and 30 minutes prior to administration of probe drugs on the 3rd day. In Phase II, 16 male volunteers were randomized to the order of receiving one glass of (1) single-strength (SS) GFJ, (2) DS GFJ, and (3) water (placebo). All treatments were administered in a fasted state. There was at least a 7-day washout period between treatments. Probe drugs, administered 30 minutes or 1 hour following each treatment in Phase I or II, respectively, consisted of oral midazolam (2 mg) coadministered with IV [14G N-methyl] erythromycin (0.03 mg). The EBT was performed 20 minutes following erythromycin administration. Blood was collected during the 24 hours following probe drug administration for the analysis of midazolam pharmacokinetics. In Phase I, consumption of one glass of DS GFJ tid for 3 days increased the Cmax of midazolam 3-fold, the AUC 6-fold, and the t1/2 2-fold and decreased the amount of exhaled 14CO2 in all 8 subjects, with a mean decrease in EBT of 18%. In Phase II, consumption of one glass of DS GFJ significantly increased the AUC and Cmax of midazolam approximately 2-fold without a significant effect on the t1/2 of midazolam or the EBT. The effects of consuming one glass of SS GFJ on midazolam pharmacokinetics and the EBT were not significantly different from those of one glass of DS GFJ. It was concluded that consumption of one glass of DS GFJ tid for 3 days significantly increased the AUC, Cmax, and t1/2 of midazolam and reduced EBT values, reflecting inhibition of both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4. In contrast, consumption of one glass of SS or DS GFJ increased midazolam AUC and Cmax, with little effect on the midazolam t1/2 and EBT values, reflecting preferential inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4. Alterations of midazolam AUC and Cmax induced by nine glasses of DS GFJ were significantly greater than those produced by one glass of SS or DS GFJ. These data suggest that GFJ inhibits intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 in an exposure-dependent fashion and that patients taking medications that are CYP3A4 substrates are at risk for developing drug-related adverse events if they consume large amounts of grapefruit juice.", 
    "65": "The capacities of citrus fruits to inhibit midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) expressed in human liver microsomes were evaluated. Eight citrus fruits such as ama-natsu, banpeiyu, Dekopon, hassaku, hyuga-natsu, completely matured kinkan (Tamatama), takaoka-buntan and unshu-mikan were tested. We also examined the inhibition of CYP3A activity by grapefruit (white) and grapefruit juice (white, Tropicana-Kirin). The addition of a fruit juice prepared from banpeiyu, hassaku, takaoka-buntan or Tamatama caused the inhibition of the microsomal CYP3A activity. The inhibition depended on the amount of a fruit juice added to the incubation mixture (2.5 and 5.0%, v/v). The fruit juice from banpeiyu showed the most potent inhibition of CYP3A. The addition of a banpeiyu juice (5.0%, v/v) resulted in the inhibition of midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity to about 20% of control without a fruit juice. The elongation of the preincubation period of a fruit juice from banpeiyu (5.0%, v/v) with the microsomal fraction (5 to 15 min) led to the enhancement of the CYP3A inhibition (5% of control). Thus, we discovered ingredients of banpeiyu to be inhibitor(s) or mechanism-based inhibitor(s) of human CYP3A activity, but the inhibitory effects of them were somewhat lower than those of grapefruit.", 
    "66": "Since the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play an important role in depression and schizophrenia, we studied the effects of fluoxetine and olanzapine on PFC neurons in rats using extracellular, in vivo recordings. Acute or 5-day administration of olanzapine (1-10 mg/kg, iv or 20 mg/kg, sc) did not change the firing rate of PFC neurons. However, a 21-day treatment with olanzapine (20 mg/kg per day, sc) significantly increased the firing rate of PFC neurons and increased their responsiveness to the iontophoretic administration of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline. Acute administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, iv) also did not change the firing rate of PFC neurons. However, a 21-day treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg per day) significantly decreased the firing rate of PFC neurons and decreased their responsiveness to the iontophoretic administration of bicuculline. Co-administration of olanzapine (10 mg/kg per day, sc) during the last 5 days of a 21-day fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg per day) prevented the suppression of firing and decreased responsiveness to the iontophoretic administration of bicuculline of PFC neurons. In conclusion, chronic, but not acute, olanzapine treatment significantly enhanced the firing and excitability of PFC neurons. In addition, chronic, but not acute, fluoxetine treatment significantly suppressed the firing and excitability of PFC neurons. Further, short-term olanzapine treatment attenuated the suppression of firing and excitability of PFC neurons induced by chronic fluoxetine treatment. These effects of olanzapine, fluoxetine, and the olanzapine/fluoxetine combination in the PFC may play an important role in the beneficial therapeutic effect of these compounds in schizophrenia and depression and may have implications for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression.",

In addressing this issue, the current report presents an open-label, prospective, 13 week trial with olanzapine use in Chinese schizophrenic patients who were resistant to more than two different classes of antipsychotics during a minimal 4 week treatment period for each antipsychotic drug at adequate dosage. Fifty-one inpatients were recruited after a cross-titration period and given 10-25 mg of olanzapine daily, without any concomitant antipsychotic medication. Patients were evaluated with the Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale, the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, the Simpson-Angus scale, and the Barnes Akathisia Scale. The olanzapine-treated patients showed significant improvement in both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia by the end of the study. Overall, 20 of 51 (39.2%) responded to 10-25 mg of olanzapine per day as measured by the BPRS and CGI scores. Five patients dropped out due to the worsening of their psychotic symptoms, two patients discontinued owing to poor drug compliance, and the remaining patient complained of a lack of efficacy. Extrapyramidal side-effects were mild, and anticholinergic medications required has decreased. The present open study suggests that olanzapine may be effective and well-tolerated in Chinese treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients.

These mice develop an adult-onset neurologic phenotype of incoordination, involuntary limb clasping, seizures, and premature death. Histologic analysis demonstrates widespread ubiquinated neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs). We now report characterization of the age of onset of behavioral abnormalities, correlated with the time course of occurrence of NIIs in several brain regions, and the occurrence of NIIs in non-neuronal tissues. Onset of behavioral abnormalities occurred at approximately 22 weeks of age. There was variable time course of expression of NIIs in several brain regions. Assessment of several non-neuronal tissues revealed nuclear inclusions in hepatocytes and choroid plexus epithelium. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptors, dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptors, and type 2 vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) binding sites were assayed before and after the onset of behavioral abnormalities. GABA/benzodiazepine receptors were unchanged either before or after the onset of behavioral abnormalities in any region analyzed, whereas striatal D1-like and D2-like receptors were diminished after but not before the onset of symptoms. Dorsal striatal VMAT2 binding sites were decreased before the onset of behavioral changes. Mitochondrial electron transport chain components were assayed with histochemical methods before and after the onset of behavioral changes. There was no change in behaviorally presymptomatic or symptomatic animals.

Anxiolytic activity of Proproten-100 was highly competitive with that of phenazepam. Proproten-100 produced a stronger thymoleptic effect than amitriptyline.

Intracerebroventricular administration of Proproten, diazepam, and mexidol in doses of 2.5 ml/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg, respectively, produced a strong anxiolytic effect on male outbred rats in the conflict situation and markedly increased the incidence of punished drinking. Antagonists of GABAergic transmission bicuculline (GABAA receptor blocker) and picrotoxin (chlorine channel blocker) produced the pro-conflict anxiogenic effect, which was accompanied by a decrease in the number of punished drinking in control animals. The anti-conflict effect of Proproten was less pronounced during blockade of GABAA receptors or chlorine channels. Bicuculline and picrotoxin similarly modulated the anxiolytic effect of diazepam and mexidol.

Proproten significantly increased the incidence of punished drinking in the conflict situation with pain stimulation, number of entries, and time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze and decreased the rate of defecation and urination. In the open-field test Proproten induced entries of rats into the center of an illuminated area. Proproten was efficient after single administration and course of treatment (2 times a day, 5 days).

Atropine is well-tolerated and high doses may be required. The oxime pralidoxime chloride has a longer half-life in children. Currently, diazepam is the standard NA anticonvulsant. Midazolam may be the most effective intramuscular anticonvulsant after NA exposure, but, despite its efficacy, it is not an approved agent for seizures. Supportive care and long-term complications are summarized.", 
    "81": "The role of several drugs (lithium, betablockers, clonidine, digoxin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, interferon and tetracyclines) in inducing or exacerbating psoriasis is not completely understood. We report two cases of psoriasis in patients treated with olanzapine, a new drug used for psychotic disorders. In the first patient worsening of a pre-existing mild psoriasis occurred shortly after starting olanzapine treatment, followed by a relapse of the dermatological disease after a new administration of the anti-psychotic drug. In the second case we observed the onset of psoriasis during olanzapine treatment in an individual without any previous history of psoriasis but with a family history of the disease. Although the mechanism by which psoriasis may be induced or exacerbated by olanzapine remains unknown, these observations underline the need for caution and close follow-up in the pharmacological management of patients with psoriasis or a family history of the disease.", 
    "82": "Molecular mechanisms for systems level adaptivity of brain activation are largely unknown but a key role for active inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is plausible. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to contrast the modulatory effects on brain adaptivity to task repetition and task difficulty of two GABAergic drugs, lorazepam and flumazenil. In a working memory paradigm, occipitotemporal regions clearly demonstrated attenuation of activation as a function of within-session task repetition or practice in data acquired following placebo, but this spatiotemporal pattern of repetition adaptivity was abolished by both lorazepam and flumazenil. However, in other brain systems flumazenil enhanced repetition adaptivity compared to placebo: in frontal cortex, flumzenil induced attenuation of signal related to task repetition and in hippocampus it exaggerated normal enhancement of signal with repetition. In contrast, there were no significant effects of either flumazenil or lorazepam on areas of frontal cortex which normally demonstrated significant neurocognitive load response or adaptivity to task difficulty. We argue that repetition adaptivity of large-scale brain systems is regulated by GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms and that expression of repetition adaptivity in a given brain system may show an \"inverted-U\" form of relationship with pharmacologically manipulable levels of GABAergic inhibitory tone.", 
    "83": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an important option for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Through delivery of a battery-supplied intermittent current, VNS protects against seizure development in a manner that correlates experimentally with electrophysiological modifications. However, the mechanism by which VNS inhibits seizures in humans remains unclear. The impairment of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neuronal inhibition associated with epilepsy has suggested that GABA(A) receptors might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of VNS. We have now applied single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist [123I]iomazenil to examine cortical GABA(A) receptor density (GRD) before and 1 year after implantation of a VNS device in 10 subjects with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. VNS therapeutic responses resulted significantly correlated with the normalization of GRD. Moreover, a comparable control group, scheduled for a possible VNS implant, failed to show significant GRD variations after 1 year of a stable anti-epileptic treatment. These results suggest that VNS may modulate the cortical excitability of brain areas associated with epileptogenesis and that GABA(A) receptor plasticity contributes to this effect.", 
    "84": "A significant weight gain in the course of treatment of epilepsy with valproic acid (VPA) was described in several clinical studies. We recently demonstrated that postprandial insulin levels are increased in patients with VPA therapy. This possible modulation of pancreatic insulin secretion by VPA could be due to the structure of VPA as a fatty acid derivative and thus to direct stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion or competition with free fatty acids (FFA) for albumin binding. In order to investigate the effect of VPA on insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells we performed in vitro experiments with islets from pancreases of multiorgan donors. After preparation, the incubation with valproate caused a time and dose-dependent increase of insulin concentration in the cell supernatant. This could also be demonstrated with the control drug, lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, but not with mirtazepin and phenytoin. It can be speculated that an increase in pancreatic insulin secretion under chronic VPA treatment enhances appetite and energy storage and is related to the observed weight gain.", 
    "85": "Physiological parameters, metabolic parameters and stress-related hormones are evaluated in horses anaesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen combined with lidocaine intravenously. Two groups of horses anaesthetized with isoflurane (six horses in each group) were studied: a lidocaine group (IL), which received intravenous lidocaine and a control group (C), which received intravenous saline. Horses in both groups were premedicated with detomidine (i.v.), and anaesthesia was induced with midazolam-ketamine (i.v.). The lidocaine group received intravenous lidocaine as a loading dose of 2.5 mg kg(-1) at 15 min after induction of anaesthesia directly followed by a maintenance dosage of 50 microg kg(-1) min(-1), while the control group received saline (i.v.) following the same regime. End-tidal isoflurane and standard physiological parameters were measured. Blood was sampled for measurement of lidocaine, stress hormones and metabolic parameters. The end-tidal isoflurane concentration in the lidocaine group was 0.96 +/- 0.06% versus 1.28 +/- 0.06% (mean +/- SD) in the control group, a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of 25%. No significant differences were found regarding stress-related hormones, metabolic and physiological parameters. This study suggests that the use of lidocaine to decrease the concentration of isoflurane to obtain a sufficient surgical anaesthesia has no subsequent effects on physiological and metabolic parameters or stress-related hormones.", 
    "86": "Anxiety disorders are common and costly psychiatric illnesses. Pharmacological treatment was enhanced with the introduction of benzodiazepines, which proved safer and more effective than older drugs. The risk of dependence, however, has made clinicians reluctant to use these medications. In fact, few patients appear to develop significant difficulties with these drugs, given how widely they are used. Careful planning for discontinuation of therapy is important. In addition, for some individuals, there appears to be a complex and as yet unelucidaied relationship between dependence on drugs or alcohol and anxiety. The newer antidepressants offer efficacy without abuse or dependence liability, but are expensive and have side effects that are intolerable for some patients. Pharmacological therapy for anxiety should be prescribed and managed so as to minimize any existing risk, while aiming to restore the patient to wellness in terms of symptoms and function.", 
    "87": "Unlike in rodents, CCK has not been established as a physiological regulator in avian exocrine pancreatic secretion. In the isolated duck pancreatic acini, 1 nM CCK was required for stimulation of amylase secretion, maximal effect being achieved at 10 nM; picomolar CCK was without effect. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) receptor (VPAC) agonists PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 (10(-12)-10(-7) M) alone had no effect, but made picomolar CCK effective. VPAC agonist VIP 10(-10)-10(-7) M stimulated amylase secretion marginally, but made CCK 10(-12)-10(-10) M effective also. PACAP-27 and VIP both shifted the maximal CCK concentration from 10(-8) to 10(-9) M. This sensitizing effect was mimicked by forskolin. CCK dose dependently induced intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) oscillations. PACAP-38 (1 nM), PACAP-27 (1 nM), VIP (10 nM), or forskolin (10 microM) alone did not stimulate [Ca2+]i increase, neither did they modulate CCK (1 nM)-induced oscillations; but when they were added to cells simultaneously exposed to subthreshold CCK (10 pM), calcium spikes emerged. Amylase secretion induced by the simultaneous presence of 10 pM CCK and VPAC agonists was completely blocked by removing extracellular calcium, but the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (1 microM) was without effect. CCK (10 nM)-induced secretion was inhibited by CCK1 receptor antagonist FK480 (1 microM). Gastrin from 10(-12) to 10(-6) M did not stimulate amylase secretion nor did it (100 nM) induce [Ca2+]i increase. The above data suggest that duck pancreatic acini possess both CCK1 and VPAC receptors; simultaneous activation of both is required for each to play a physiological role.", 
    "88": "The development of tolerance to the hypolocomotor effects of Diazepam (DZ) is thought to be a contingent or learning phenomenon. In previous reports, we demonstrated a positive correlation between the development of tolerance to the sedative effects of DZ and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, previous exposure to the drug administration context blocks both the tolerance to sedative effects of DZ and the increased hippocampal plasticity. The results of the present investigation show that the development of tolerance to hypolocomotor action of DZ (5 mg/kg/day) for 4 days results in a significant increase in the hybridization signals for mRNA for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor NR1 and NR2B subunits in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore, we have observed more benzodiazepine binding sites in the hippocampus of non-tolerant animals. We conclude that the increased hippocampal synaptic efficacy in DZ tolerant rats, may be NMDA receptor dependent due to an increased recombinant NR1-NR2B complex observed in the hippocampal formation of tolerant rats.", 
    "89": "Psychological stress influences behaviour as well as autonomic functions such as body temperature. The mechanism that induces hyperthermia during stress is unknown. A recent hypothesis suggests that interleukin-6 (IL-6), an endogenous pyrogen, elevates body temperature during stress. To investigate the role of IL-6 during stress, we measured mRNA levels of IL-6 by quantitative PCR in various tissues 60 min after exposure of mice to open field stress. IL-6 mRNA was elevated in the hypothalamus three-fold and in the pituitary two-fold. However, there was no difference between the increase in body temperature after exposure to 60 min open field stress in wild-type controls (35.2+/-0.6-37.3+/-0.5 degrees C) and IL-6-deficient animals (34.8+/-0.4-37.0+/-0.3 degrees C). In contrast to body temperature, emotional behaviour differed between wild-type controls and IL-6-deficient mice. IL-6-deficient animals showed higher locomotor activity in an open field and lower levels of exploration of the open arms of the elevated plus maze than control animals. These data suggest that IL-6 plays an important role in the control of emotionality, but not in the regulation of body temperature after psychological stress.", 
    "90": "Manganese neurotoxicity (MN) is a neurological disorder characterized by selective neuronal loss in the globus pallidus together with characteristic morphological changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for these processes, we studied early effects of this metal in a sub-acute rat model. Levels of manganese in the globus pallidus were increased by 81% after 1 day of treatment and elevated by 551% compared to controls after 4 days. In addition, manganese treatment led to a 60% increase in ptbr expression, and a 105% increase in levels of its product, the isoquinoline-carboxamide binding protein, a major constituent of the 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) that is localized to astrocytes, in this brain region after 4 days. These results indicate that PTBRs, and possibly neurosteroids, are an early response to manganese exposure and may play a major role in the pathophysiology of MN.", 
    "91": "Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) significantly impacts upon quality of life and has a chronic and persistent nature. GAD requires pharmacological therapies that are well-tolerated, lessen the mitigating effects of common comorbidities and do not pose a high risk for dependency or abuse. Selective serotonin and serotonin-noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors have become more viable treatments for GAD than the traditionally used benzodiazepines due to greater efficacy and a more tolerable adverse event profile. Among these newer-generation antidepressants, only paroxetine and venlafaxine are currently FDA-approved for the treatment of GAD. Paroxetine was approved after three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrated its superior efficacy compared to placebo for short-term treatment of GAD. Venlafaxine was approved for both short- and long-term treatment of GAD after demonstrating efficacy in 8-week and 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. For both paroxetine and venlafaxine, the safety and tolerability profiles during treatment of GAD are consistent with those demonstrated during the short- and long-term treatment of patients with major depressive disorder.",

It involves a four-step sequence including nucleophilic displacement, acylation, simultaneous reduction-cyclization and alkylation, providing rapid access to the title compounds in excellent yield and purity.", 
    "93": "The present study examines the molecular mechanisms by which a member of a novel series of pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines, PBOX-21, induces G1 arrest in 1321N1 cells. PBOX-21-induced G1 arrest is preceded by both a decrease in CDK2 kinase activity, which is critical for the G1/S transition, and a downregulation in cyclin D(3) protein expression levels, suggesting that these two events may be crucially involved in the mediation of the cell cycle arrest. The decrease in CDK2 activity may be due to an observed decrease in CDK2 protein levels following PBOX-21 treatment. Coinciding with the arrest is a reduction in the activity of CDK4, due to either the observed PBOX-21 induced downregulation in CDK4 expression, or a reduction in complex formation between cyclin D(3)-CDK4 leading to a decrease in the levels of active cyclin D(3)-CDK4 complexes with kinase activity. The level of CDK6 activity was also seen to be reduced following PBOX-21 treatment, also possibly due to a reduction in complex formation with cyclin D(3). However, this reduction in CDK6 kinase activity was not seen until after PBOX-21-induced G1 arrest has reached its maximum, and therefore may be viewed as a consequence of, and a method of maintaining the PBOX-21-induced arrest, rather than a cause. Also in parallel with the G1 arrest elicited by PBOX-21 is an upregulation in the universal CDK inhibitor, p21. Furthermore, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a substrate of CDK2 and CDK6, whose phosphorylation is necessary for cell cycle progression, becomes hypophosphorylated. These results indicate that PBOX-21 exerts its growth inhibitory effects through the modulation of the expression and activity of several key G1 regulatory proteins.", 
    "94": "The precise mechanism by which the hormone-induced minimal cAMP levels act at the mitochondria to activate cholesterol transport and steroid synthesis is unknown. We propose that this mechanism involves a macromolecular signaling complex where a newly identified peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)-associated protein (PAP7) binds the regulatory subunit RIalpha of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), thus allowing for local efficient catalytic activation and phosphorylation of the substrate steroidogenesis acute regulatory protein (StAR), leading to cholesterol transfer from the low affinity StAR to the high affinity PBR cholesterol binding protein. The mouse and human PAP7 proteins were cloned, their genomic organization and chromosomal localization characterized, their tissue distribution evaluated and subcellular localization defined. PAP7 is highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues, where it follows the pattern of PKA-RIalpha expression and data from a human adrenal disease suggest that it participates in PKA-RIalpha-mediated tumorigenesis and hormone-independent hypercortisolism. PAP7 is localized in the Golgi and mitochondria and inhibition of PAP7 expression results in reduced hormone-induced cholesterol transport into mitochondria and decreased steroid formation. Taken together, these data suggest that PAP7 functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) critical in the cAMP-dependent steroid formation.",

    "99": "Mitochondria have been found to sequester and release Ca2+ during cell stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-generating agonists, thereby generating subplasmalemmal microdomains of low Ca2+ that sustain activity of capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). Procedures that prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibit local Ca2+ buffering and CCE, but it is not clear whether Ca2+ has to transit through or remains trapped in the mitochondria. Thus, we analyzed the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux on the ability of mitochondria to buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+, to maintain CCE, and to facilitate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) refilling in endothelial cells. Upon the addition of histamine, the initial mitochondrial Ca2+ transient, monitored with ratio-metric-pericam-mitochondria, was largely independent of extracellular Ca2+. However, subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ produced a reversible decrease in [Ca2+]mito, indicating that Ca2+ was continuously taken up and released by mitochondria, although [Ca2+]mito had returned to basal levels. Accordingly, inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with CGP 37157 increased [Ca2+]mito and abolished the ability of mitochondria to buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+, resulting in an increased activity of BKCa channels and a decrease in CCE. Hence, CGP 37157 also reversibly inhibited ER refilling during cell stimulation. These effects of CGP 37157 were mimicked if mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was prevented with oligomycin/antimycin A. Thus, during cell stimulation a continuous Ca2+ flux through mitochondria underlies the ability of mitochondria to generate subplasmalemmal microdomains of low Ca2+, to facilitate CCE, and to relay Ca2+ from the plasma membrane to the ER.", 
    "100": "In this study, we documented the effects of different peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands: PK 11195, Ro5-4864 and the newly described SSR 180575 on the development of pulmonary inflammation in vivo. To this aim, we used MRL/lpr mice that develop pathological signs similar to the human lupus erythematosus (LE) signs. We found that a chronic treatment (at 3 mg/kg per i.p. for 30 days) with PBR ligands had a significant beneficial therapeutic action and decreased the inflammatory pulmonary responses and alveolitis onset. When analyzing PBR expression in inflamed tissues, we observed that in addition to the infiltrated leukocytes, PBR was expressed in the bronchial epithelium, and especially we evidenced for the first time that PBR in expressed in Clara cells. Interestingly, we observed that PBR expression in those cells was reduced when MRL/lpr mice developed the pathology and restored upon PBR ligand treatment. These original findings support a role of PBR in pulmonary inflammatory process and suggest new therapeutic applications in auto immune disorders for specific potent PBR ligands.", 
    "101": "Exogenous melatonin is a potential treatment for circadian disruption and insomnia. Hence, it is important to determine and quantify neurobehavioural performance effects associated with its use. The present study compared neurobehavioural performance following administration of melatonin and the benzodiazepine temazepam, using a within-subjects design. Following a training day, 16 healthy, young subjects (six males, 10 females; mean age +/- SEM, 21.4 +/- 6 years) participated in a 3-day protocol. After sleeping overnight in the laboratory, subjects completed a battery of tests at hourly intervals between 08:00 and 11:00 hours and at two hourly intervals between 13:00 and 17:00 hours. The neurobehavioural performance tasks included: unpredictable tracking, spatial memory, vigilance and logical reasoning. Subjective sleepiness was measured at hourly intervals using a visual analogue scale. At 12:00 h subjects were administered a capsule containing 5 mg melatonin, 10 mg temazepam or placebo, in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. A significant drug x time interaction was evident on the unpredictable tracking, spatial memory and vigilance tasks (P < 0.05). Greater changes in performance were evident following temazepam administration than melatonin administration, relative to placebo. Administration of melatonin or temazepam significantly elevated subjective sleepiness levels, relative to placebo (P </= 0.05). The present findings demonstrate that melatonin administration induces a smaller deficit in performance on a range of neurobehavioural tasks than temazepam. Given melatonin's soporific and chronobiotic properties, these results suggest that melatonin may be preferable to benzodiazepines in the management of circadian and sleep disorders.", 
    "102": "Involuntary movements of the mouth can present as palatal tremor, which is frequently associated with hypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus and can be accompanied by contraction of other muscles of the head. We report the case of a 39-year-old man with autoimmune thyroiditis and diabetes who complained of involuntary rhythmic tremor involving the muscles of the floor of the mouth, which interfered with breathing and swallowing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed the presence of oligoclonal bands and screening for anti-neuronal antibodies revealed high titres of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD-Ab). Tremor responded to treatment with benzodiazepines. The correlation between the tremor and antibody positivity is unclear although an alteration of the gabaergic system mediated by the antibodies may be hypothesised on the basis of an inflammatory CSF profile.",

However, paddling immediately after induction observed in other reports of equine propofol anesthesia was not observed. Recovery time was 35.3 +/- 9.3 min and the quality of recovery was calm and smooth in all horses. Respiration rate decreased after induction and hypoxemia was observed during lateral recumbency.

    "105": "Anticonvulsant drugs (ACs) have diverse antiseizure, psychotropic, and biochemical effects. Carbamazepine and valproate have mood-stabilizing actions, benzodiazepines and gabapentin have anxiolytic actions, lamotrigine is useful in rapid cycling and acute treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar depression, and topiramate and zonisamide can yield weight loss. Limited controlled data suggest the carbamazepine keto derivative oxcarbazepine has antimanic effects. A categorical approach to the diverse roles of ACs in bipolar disorders is proposed, using broad categories of ACs, on the basis of their predominant psychotropic profiles. Thus, some ACs have \"sedating\" profiles that may include sedation, cognitive difficulties, fatigue, weight gain, and possibly antimanic and/or anxiolytic effects. In contrast, some newer ACs have \"activating\" profiles that may include improved energy, weight loss, and possibly antidepressant and even anxiogenic effects. Still other newer ACs have novel \"mixed\" profiles, combining sedation and weight loss. A categorical-mechanistic extension of this approach is also presented, with hypotheses that \"sedating\" profiles might be related to prominent potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission, \"activating\" profiles could be related to prominent attenuation of glutamate excitatory neurotransmission, and for \"mixed\" profiles, sedation and weight loss might be related to concurrent GABAergic and antiglutamatergic actions, respectively. The categorical approach may have utility as an aid to clinicians in reinforcing the heterogeneity ACs, and recalling psychotropic profiles of individual ACs, but is limited as it fails to address the etiology of the heterogeneity of AC psychotropic effects. The categorical-mechanistic extension strives to address this issue, but requires systematic clinical investigation of more precise relationships between psychotropic profiles and discrete mechanisms of action to assess its merits.", 
    "106": "Anxiety is a part of daily life. While mild levels of anxiety can be positive, moderate to severe levels can cause intense distress. When anxiety interferes with a person's ability to function, it warrants treatment. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic disabling condition characterized by at least 6 months of frequent worries and three of the following symptoms: fatigue, restlessness, poor concentration, irritability, muscle tension, and unsatisfying sleep. The primary treatment for anxiety is pharmacotherapy. Medication prescribed for anxiety has shifted from exclusive benzodiazepine therapy to a combination of benzodiazepine and antidepressant drugs. The principal disadvantages of benzodiazepines are their long-term use with associated physical dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms. Several reports support the serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety disorders.", 
    "107": "Structural and functional neuroimaging studies are essential in the evaluation of individuals with partial epilepsy syndromes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important to delineate structural abnormalities underlying seizure disorders, commonly including hippocampal sclerosis or cortical dysplasias. Identification of a structural lesion is often a reliable indicator of the site of seizure onset. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows us to investigate cerebral metabolites and some neurotransmitters. Reduction in various metabolite concentrations has proven to be prognostically valuable when no structural abnormality is identified. Positron emission tomography (PET) using deoxyglucose demonstrates areas of reduced glucose metabolism, which are the hallmark of epileptogenic zones and usually extend beyond the underlying anatomical region. It is useful in temporal lobe epilepsy for lateralization; however, results in extratemporal lobe epilepsy have been less favorable. More promising is the use of benzodiazepine receptor ligands, which are reduced in the epileptogenic zone in a more restricted distribution. This appears to be helpful in the localization of extratemporal seizure foci. Peri-ictal single photon emission computed tomography measures increased blood flow during the ictal event and is beneficial in patients with normal MRI studies to determine lateralization and localization of the ictal onset zone. All imaging modalities should be correlated with clinical and neurophysiological data.",

Gas chromatographic screening of the stomach contents, blood and urine was positive for triazolam and alpha-hydroxytriazolam that were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Blood concentrations of triazolam and free alpha-hydroxytriazolam were 62-251 and 10-66 ng/ml, respectively. A substantial amount of triazolam was detected in bile (1130 ng/ml), but not in urine. Free and total alpha-hydroxytriazolam concentrations were 3920 and 7050 ng/ml, respectively, in the bile and 3710 and 9670 ng/ml, respectively, in urine. Organs contained 216-583 ng/g triazolam. The concentration of free alpha-hydroxytriazolam in the kidney (246 ng/g) was higher than in any other organ. Free alpha-hydroxytriazolam was not detected in the liver. The concentrations of total alpha-hydroxytriazolam in the liver and kidney were 784 and 381 ng/g, respectively. Free to total ratios of alpha-hydroxytriazolam were 0.14-0.56 in fluid samples and 0.56-0.92 in tissue samples, except for the liver. A large quantity of triazolam (8.4 mg) remained in the stomach. The victim probably died of postural asphyxia caused by triazolam poisoning.", 
    "119": "The present study examined the stressor-like effects of repeated (4 days) administration of cocaine hydrochloride(COC) (35 mg/kg, i.p.) on the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) (HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HSC70) and stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) (SAPKalpha, SAPKbeta, SAPKgamma) in the rat hippocampus. The interactions with intraperitoneal ethanol and drugs known as antidotes against COC toxicity were also examined. Similar to the effects of a 10 min immobilization stress (IM) over 4 days, an early increase (5 h time point) in nerve cells immunoreactive for HSPs (HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HSC70) and SAPKs (SAPKbeta, SAPKgamma) was observed in the COC group. At the 24 h time point, a recovery was observed only for SAPKs, which have been suggested to control the HSP levels. Before the 48 h time point, alterations in the number of HSP+cells as compared to the control group (increase for HSP27 and HSP70+cells, and attenuation for HSP60 and HSC70+cells) could still be observed. Stress-related, attenuated swimming behaviors in the forced swimming test were also the most severe at the 5 h time point. Ethanol (1.5 g/kg) cotreatment on each administration day, even at non-toxic and/or euphoric doses, enhanced these stressor-like alterations. On the other hand, the protective effects of daily coadministered drugs related to benzodiazepine (5 mg/kg Ro 15-4513), dopamine (0.5 mg/kg SCH 23390), muscarinic (0.25 mg/kg pirenzepine) and serotonin (5 mg/kg ketanserin) receptors could be observed on the number of HSP-immunoreactive (24 h) and SAPK-immunoreactive cells (5 h). Against the stressor-altered swimming behaviors, Ro 15-4513 and SCH 23390 were more effective as compared to pirenzepine and ketanserin.", 
    "120": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine and is widely prescribed for preanesthesia or general anesthesia. Overdose or intoxication cases of midazolam have been reported. In Japan, smuggled midazolam tablets could be involved in some criminal cases. Midazolam and its two metabolites were extracted by the solid-phase extraction method using Bond Elut SCX cartridges. The compounds were analyzed by on-line capillary high-performance liquid chromatography/fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. Midazolam and its two metabolites were well separated on the chromatogram, and each mass spectra gave [M+H](+) ion as a base peak. Deuterium-labeled midazolam was synthesized as an internal standard; it has enabled precise and reproducible quantitation of midazolam in blood samples. The calibration curve showed excellent linearity in the range of 2-200 ng/ml in spiked serum. The detection limit was 300 pg/ml (signal-to-noise ratio=3). The whole blood and urine samples from the victim of a homicide case were analyzed, and the midazolam concentration in the whole blood was estimated to be 163 ng/ml. The present method should be useful in clinical and forensic toxicology, because of its high sensitivity and specificity.", 
    "121": "A tri-substituted benzoflavone moiety (BZF) recently isolated from the methanol extract of aerial parts of the plant Passiflora incarnata Linneaus had exhibited encouraging results in countering the dependence produced by addiction-prone substances like morphine, nicotine, cannabinoids and ethyl alcohol, during the studies performed by the authors. Since the BZF moiety had exhibited significant anxiolytic properties at 10 mg/kg p.o. dose in mice, therefore, it was desirable to evaluate this potential phyto-moiety (BZF) for its own dependence-liabilities It was also deemed viable to evaluate BZF moiety for its possible usefulness in countering the dependence-liabilities associated with the chronic use of benzodiazepines keeping in light their tremendous clinical use in the management of anxiety and insomnia.", 
    "122": "Different groups of mice were administered BZF alone (10, 50 or 100 mg/kg, p.o.), and concomitantly with diazepam (20 mg/kg, p.o.) in a 21-days treatment regimen, followed by no treatments for the next 72-hours. The withdrawal effects in the form of ambulatory behavior of the treated animals were recorded on the 25th day using an Actophotometer.", 
    "123": "The BZF-alone (three doses) treated mice exhibited a normal ambulatory behavior on 25th day. Mice groups receiving co-treatments, i.e., BZF-diazepam concomitantly, also exhibited a normal ambulatory behavior in a dose-dependent manner, i.e., the higher dose of BZF (100 mg/kg) being more effective in countering the withdrawal effects of chronically administered diazepam than the lower doses (10 or 50 mg/kg).", 
    "124": "The studies revealed that the chronic administration of the BZF moiety (three doses), did not exhibit any dependence-liability of its own, even upon an abrupt cessation. Additionally, the BZF co-treatments with diazepam also prevented the incurrence of diazepam-dependence, which might be because of the aromatase enzyme inhibiting properties associated with the BZF moiety.", 
    "125": "Previous studies have examined the safety and tolerability of oral-loaded divalproex sodium in the treatment of acute mania, but not the early efficacy of this dosing strategy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex.", 
    "126": "In this pooled analysis, 348 subjects from 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- or placebo-controlled studies were used to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral-loaded divalproex with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, olanzapine, or placebo. Subjects were inpatients diagnosed with acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R or -IV and SADS-Change Version). Patients were administered oral-loaded divalproex (20 or 30 mg/kg/day on days 1 and 2 followed by 20 mg/kg/day, and increased at physician's discretion), standard-titration divalproex initiated at 250 mg t.i.d. and titrated to 40-150 microg/mL, lithium (300 mg t.i.d. initial dose) titrated to 0.4 to 1.5 mEq/L, olanzapine (10 mg q.d. initial dose) up to 20 mg/day, or placebo.", 
    "127": "The results demonstrate an early efficacy advantage for oral-loaded divalproex compared to standard-titration divalproex at days 5, 7/8, and 10. Efficacy was improved over lithium on day 7/8. There were no efficacy differences between divalproex loading and olanzapine. Divalproex loading showed greater efficacy than placebo at all time points. Divalproex loading was as well tolerated or better tolerated than the other active treatments as measured by adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters.", 
    "128": "These results suggest the oral loading of divalproex leads to a more rapid antimanic effect when compared with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, or placebo and is better tolerated than olanzapine and as well tolerated as lithium or standard-titration divalproex.", 
    "129": "The hyperprolactinemia induced by conventional antipsychotics often leads to osteoporosis. The commonly used atypical antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine vary in their hyperprolactinemic properties. Therefore, we compared hormone profiles and bone properties in female premenopausal schizophrenia patients treated with either risperidone or olanzapine.", 
    "130": "In a cross-sectional study, consecutive premenopausal, female, DSM-IV schizophrenia patients who were treated with either risperidone (N = 12) or olanzapine (N = 14) for at least 2 years were included. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry evaluated bone mineral density, and multisite quantitative ultrasound measured bone speed of sound. In addition, profiles of urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline and circulating levels of hormones and lipids were assessed.", 
    "131": "Serum prolactin levels were higher in the risperidone-treated group as compared with the olanzapine subjects (123 +/- 144 and 25.9 +/- 25.7, p <.05). Whereas bone mineral density was similar in the treatment groups, bone speed of sound was lower in the risperidone group as compared with the olanzapine-treated group. Expressed as age-adjusted Z score, bone speed of sound at the radius was -0.31 and 0.58, respectively, p <.05, and at the phalanx, -1.41 and 0.04, respectively, p <.05. The bone speed of sound in the risperidone-treated patients inversely correlated with urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion (r = 0.73, p <.05).", 
    "132": "Risperidone treatment, as opposed to olanzapine, for female premenopausal schizophrenia results in hyperprolactinemia and clinically relevant decrease in bone mineral density. The calculated relative risk for fragility fracture of women treated with risperidone as compared to those treated with olanzapine is 1.78 when bone speed of sound was measured at the phalanx and 1.23 when measured at the radius.", 
    "133": "We performed this study to assess the accuracy of transcutaneous CO(2) (PTCCO(2)) monitoring compared with end-tidal CO(2) (PETCO(2)) in thoracic anesthesia. Twenty-six patients undergoing pneumonectomy with thoracotomy for which a long period of one-lung ventilation (OLV) was required were studied. The lungs were mechanically ventilated in the lateral decubitus position. PTCCO(2), PETCO(2), and arterial CO(2) (PaCO(2)) were simultaneously measured during two-lung ventilation (TLV) and during OLV at intervals of 15 min. All patients completed the study protocol. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias of -0.4 mm Hg with a precision of +/-2.5 mm Hg during OLV and 1.4 mm Hg with +/-4.3 mm Hg during TLV when PTCCO(2) and PaCO(2) were compared and revealed a bias of -5.8 mm Hg with a precision of +/-4.1 mm Hg during OLV and -7.1 mm Hg with +/-4.6 mm Hg during TLV when PETCO(2) and PaCO(2) were compared. We conclude that PTCCO(2) monitoring is accurate for evaluating CO(2) levels during thoracic anesthesia.", 
    "134": "Midazolam, widely used for sedation and anesthesia, decreases contractility in nonfatigued diaphragm; however, its effects on contractility in fatigued diaphragm that are implicated as a cause of respiratory failure have not been established. We therefore studied the effects of midazolam on diaphragm muscle function and recovery in fatigued diaphragm. Dogs were divided into three groups of eight each. In each group, diaphragmatic fatigue was induced by intermittent supramaximal bilateral electrophrenic stimulation at a frequency of 20-Hz stimulation for 30 min. When fatigue was established, Group I received no study drug; Group II was infused with a sedative dose (0.1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) of midazolam; and Group III was infused with an anesthetic dose (0.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) of midazolam. We assessed diaphragm muscle function (contractility and electrical activity) by transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) and integrated electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). In the presence of fatigue, Pdi at low-frequency (20-Hz) stimulation decreased from baseline values (P < 0.05), Pdi at high-frequency (100-Hz) stimulation did not change, and Edi to each stimulus did not change. With an infusion of midazolam, in Groups II and III, Pdi at both stimuli and Edi at 100-Hz stimulation decreased from fatigued values (P < 0.05). The decrease in Pdi and Edi was more in Group III than in Group II (P < 0.05). At 60 min after the cessation of midazolam administration, in Group II, Pdi and Edi recovered from midazolam-induced values (P < 0.05) and returned to fatigued values. In Group III, Pdi and Edi did not change from midazolam-induced values. We conclude that midazolam causes, in a dose-related manner, diaphragm muscle dysfunction in fatigued canine diaphragm and that at a sedative dose, but not at an anesthetic dose, midazolam does not delay its recovery.", 
    "135": "The circadian pacemaker in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei is responsive to photic and nonphotic stimuli. In the present study, the authors have investigated the response of activity onset and offset to application of nonphotic stimuli: the benzodiazepine midazolam and the opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. In correspondence with previous studies, both stimuli induced phase advances of the activity onset when given in the mid- to late subjective day. In contrast, activity offset did not phase advance following these injections. Injections during the early subjective day induced small phase delays of the activity onset, while large phase delays occurred in activity offset. Phase shifts, induced at both circadian time zones, were paralleled by an increase in the length of daily activity (alpha). The increase in a remained present during several days after the injection. The different kinetics in phase shifting of the activity onset and offset indicate complexity in phase-shifting behavior of the circadian pacemaker in response to nonphotic stimuli. Moreover, the data show responsiveness of the circadian system to GABA-ergic and opioid receptor activation, not only during the mid- to late subjective day but also during the early subjective day. The data implicate that the early subjective day is an interesting phase for analysis of molecular and biochemical processes involved in nonphotic phase shifting.", 
    "136": "To compare the antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron with two different hypnotic drugs (propofol 15 mg, midazolam 1 and 2 mg) for the treatment of established postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).", 
    "137": "Four-hundred-and-fifty-three patients scheduled for elective gynaecological or abdominal surgery were enrolled. One-hundred-and-twenty patients (26%) experienced postoperative emesis, and when nausea scores reached 2 or greater on a five-point scale, they were randomized to receive intravenously: propofol 15 mg (1.5 mL) in Group P, midazolam 1 mg in Group M1, midazolam 2 mg in Group M2 and ondansetron 4 mg in Group O.", 
    "138": "Four patients (13.3%) in Group P, 13 patients (43.3%) in Group M1, five patients (16.6%) in Group M2 and one patient (3.3%) in Group O required a second dose of the study drug. After administration of the study drugs, nausea scores were significantly lower in all groups than before these drugs were given. No patient had a sedation score over 3 (the patients remained awake and/or responded to verbal contact). The sedative effects of midazolam and propofol lasted for a much shorter time than the antiemetic effects of these drugs.", 
    "139": "Propofol and midazolam used in subhypnotic doses were as effective as ondansetron in treating PONV in patients undergoing abdominal or gynaecological surgery without untoward sedative or cardiovascular effects."
