    "1": "We compared the ability of metoclopramide with IV lidocaine pretreatment to abolish pain from a diazepam injection. In a randomized, prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 159 patients (ASA physical status I and II), aged 20-70 yr old, were allocated to one of three groups. Placebo and study drugs were injected IV immediately before 0.1 mg/kg of diazepam into a dorsal hand vein. Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 received 2 mL of placebo, 2 mL of lidocaine 1%, and 2 mL of metoclopramide (10 mg), respectively. The patient's response was graded using a 4-point scale. Any score other than 0 represented pain on injection. We observed that the incidence of pain on diazepam injection was 83% in the placebo group, which was decreased to 70% and 39% in patients pretreated with metoclopramide and lidocaine, respectively. Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of pain in Groups 1 and 3 (P > 0.05), Group 3 showed significantly less patients with severe pain scores than Group 1 as diazepam was injected (P < 0.000). Group 2 showed a significantly less frequent incidence of pain than the saline (P < 0.000) and the metoclopramide (P < 0.002) groups as diazepam was injected. The intensity of pain in Group 2 was significantly less than Group 3 (P = 0.012). The intensity of diazepam injection pain was intense with placebo as compared with other groups (P < 0.000). Metoclopramide, rather than lidocaine pretreatment, may be a reasonable analgesic alternative for painful injections.",

In this study, we compared the effects of halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and fentanyl/midazolam on Qp:Qs and myocardial contractility in patients with atrial (ASD) or ventricular (VSD) septal defects. Forty patients younger than 14 yr old scheduled to undergo repair of ASD or VSD were randomized to receive halothane, sevoflurane, isoflurane, or fentanyl/midazolam. Cardiovascular and echocardiographic data were recorded at baseline, randomly ordered 1 and 1.5 mean alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) levels, or predicted equivalent fentanyl/midazolam plasma levels. Ejection fraction (using the modified Simpson's rule) was calculated. Systemic (Qs) and pulmonary (Qp) blood flow was echocardiographically assessed by the velocity-time integral method. Qp:Qs was not significantly affected by any of the four regimens at either anesthetic level. Left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed by isoflurane and sevoflurane at 1.5 MAC and depressed by halothane at 1 and 1.5 MAC. Sevoflurane, halothane, isoflurane, or fentanyl/midazolam in 1 or 1.5 MAC concentrations or their equivalent do not change Qp:Qs in patients with isolated ASD or VSD.",

The optimization studies have been made in C(18) and C(8) columns, using solutions containing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) modified with butanol or pentanol as mobile phases. The method proposed for the determination of the benzodiazepines uses a hybrid micellar mobile phase of 0.06 M SDS-5% butanol-0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) at 25 degrees C, and UV detection (230 nm) in a C(18) column. The serum samples were injected directly, without any pretreatment, and eluted in less than 22 min, in accordance with their relative polarities, as indicated by their octanol-water partition coefficients. The limits of detection (ng ml(-1)) were within the ranges of 2-6 and 4-18 for aqueous and serum samples, respectively. Repeatability and intermediate precision were tested for three different concentrations of the drugs, and RSD (%) was below 10 for most of the assays.

Gastrin's growth-promoting action has been established, but a role in cellular morphogenetic processes promoting tumor invasion has been elusive. Our aim was (i) to investigate whether activation of the CCK-2R affects cellular morphology, intercellular adhesion and motility, as crucial parameters of epithelial differentiation, and (ii) to identify the signaling pathways and mechanisms implicated. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were chosen to generate an epithelial non-tumorigenic model system expressing human CCK-2R. Epithelial differentiation and motility were analysed upon CCK-2R activation using immunocytochemistry and invasion assays. The functionality of adhesion complexes and activity of signaling proteins was determined with biochemical techniques. CCK-2R activation induced cell dissociation and enhanced invasion, preceded by decreased membrane localization of adherens junction molecules and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Concomitantly, and requiring the activation of several signaling pathways, catenins were shifted from the cytoskeletal to the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting the detachment of the cytoskeleton from the adherens complex. These data represent the first evidence for the CCK-2R, regulating cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion and support a role for CCK-2R in the progression of carcinoma.",

    "15": "DMP 406 is a clozapine analogue developed by Dupont-Pharma for the treatment of schizophrenia. Unfortunately it caused agranulocytosis in dogs during preclinical studies. Clozapine also causes agranulocytosis and this is believed to be due to a reactive nitrenium ion metabolite produced by neutrophils. We studied the oxidation of DMP 406 by activated neutrophils and found that the major reactive species that is produced is not a nitrenium ion but rather an imine. This metabolite is similar to the reactive metabolite that has been proposed to be responsible for mianserin-induced agranulocytosis. Therefore we also studied the oxidation of mianserin by activated neutrophils and found that, although the major species is an iminium ion, it also bears a lactam moiety in the piperazine ring resulting from further oxidation. We usually find that HOCl is a good model system for the production of reactive metabolites of drugs that are formed by activated neutrophils, but in the case of both DMP 406 and mianserin, the products produced were significantly different than those formed by activated neutrophils. In contrast, the combination of horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide (HRP/H(2)O(2)) formed a very similar pattern of products, and this system was used to produce sufficient quantities of metabolites to allow for identification. The reactive metabolites of both DMP 406 and mianserin reacted with a range of nucleophiles, but in many cases the reaction was reversible. The best nucleophile for trapping these reactive metabolites was cyanide. It has been demonstrated that the products of clozapine oxidation by HRP/H(2)O(2), presumably the nitrenium ion, induced apoptosis in neutrophils at therapeutic concentrations of clozapine. It has been suggested that this process is involved in the mechanism of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. We tested DMP 406 and mianserin in this system to see if the ability of a reactive metabolite of a drug to cause apoptosis could predict the ability of that drug to cause agranulocytosis. We used clozapine as a positive control and we also tested olanzapine, a drug that forms a reactive metabolite similar to that of clozapine but is given at a lower dose and does not cause agranulocytosis. We found that DMP 406 did not increase apoptosis at concentrations below 50 microM, and although mianserin did increase apoptosis at 10 microM this is above the therapeutic concentration. Olanzapine caused an increase in apoptosis at the same concentration as clozapine (1 microM), but because its therapeutic concentration is lower, this concentration was above the pharmacological range. There was no increase in apoptosis with any drug in the absence of HRP/H(2)O(2). These results indicate that this assay is unable to reliably predict the ability of different types of drugs to cause agranulocytosis. This is not a surprising result given that different drugs may induce agranulocytosis by different mechanisms.",

Combinations using an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist and ketamine have been shown to be effective for immobilization but are not reversible and can produce severe hypertension and prolonged or rough recoveries. To minimize hypertension and provide reversibility, 24 red wolves were immobilized using three medetomidine-butorphanol (MB) combinations without the use of ketamine in the initial injection. All wolves were administered medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg i.m.) and butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg i.m.). Seven wolves received no other immobilization agents (MB wolves), nine received diazepam (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) at the time they were instrumented (MBD wolves), and eight received ketamine (1 mg/kg i.v.) 30 min after instrumentation (MBK30 wolves). Physiologic parameters were monitored during immobilization. The heart rate was similar among the three groups for the first 30 min, and marked bradycardia was noted in one wolf from each group. Hypertension was observed initially in all three groups but was resolved within 10-30 min. The MBK30 wolves had significant elevations in heart rate and transient hypertension after intravenous ketamine administration. Most wolves had mild to moderate metabolic acidemia. Immobilizing drugs were antagonized in all wolves with atipamezole (0.2 mg/kg i.m.) and naloxone (0.02 mg/kg i.m.). The medetomidine-butorphanol-diazepam wolves were also given flumazenil (0.04 mg/kg i.v.). All wolves were standing within 12 min and were fully recovered within 17 min. Medetomamine-butorphanol and MBD combinations provided effective and reversible immobilization of red wolves without the sustained hypertension associated with the use of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist-ketamine combinations. Delaying the administration of ketamine reduced its hypertensive effects.", 
    "20": "Treatment resistance remains a relatively common problem in panic disorder (PD) despite the success of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as first-line agents. Factors contributing to medication treatment resistance include inadequacy of trial duration, improper dosage, poor tolerability, noncompliance, and medical and psychiatric comorbidity. Poor tolerability to the SSRIs can frequently be addressed by judicious lowering of the initial dose, with a gradual upward titration. For patients who have not responded to one or more adequate trials of SSRIs, options include combination treatment with a benzodiazepine or tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), augmentation with pindolol, or switching to a different class of medication. The newer antidepressants, particularly venlafaxine XR, seem promising as alternatives, and might be beneficial for the refractory patient with a comorbid mood disorder. Anticonvulsants and olanzapine might be particularly beneficial for the refractory patient with hypomania, irritability, and insomnia, who also has demonstrated acute SSRI hypersensitivity. Experimental therapeutics in refractory panic probably will continue to examine the role of corticotropin releasing factor and glutamate/GABA systems. The role of CBT in the medication refractory patient has been explored, with preliminary suggestions of efficacy.",

Criteria previously described include: exposure to the neuroleptic class of medications; hyperthermia; muscle rigidity; a cluster of laboratory and physical findings that may include mental status changes, autonomic instability, creatine phosphokinase elevation and leukocytosis, and exclusion of other causes for the patient's condition. A prodrome of mental status changes, autonomic instability, tremors, diaphoresis, excess salivation, and extrapyramidal signs may precede NMS. Prior reports of NMS linked to olanzapine have been in patients who had been previously treated with other neuroleptic agents or in patients who had previous episodes of NMS precipitated by other neuroleptics. Several cases included patients treated with olanzapine in addition to another neuroleptic. This report describes a case of NMS associated with olanzapine in a patient who had not previously been exposed to the neuroleptic drug class. At the time this patient presented, there were no reports in the literature of NMS associated with olanzapine alone. Treatment of NMS includes: immediate withdrawal of all neuroleptics; supportive care; fever control; management of autonomic instability (tachycardia, tachypnea, blood pressure fluctuations); and pharmacologic management with dantrolene and bromocriptine.",

Concern usually arises when a medication is added to a continuing regimen, though discontinuation of a medication can also have an impact. A case is presented of a patient who experienced benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of nefazodone, an antidepressant that inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme. Plasma levels of alprazolam, a substrate for the 3A4 isozyme, fell rapidly when nefazodone was discontinued, presumably because of renewed 3A4 isoenzyme activity. The management of the patient's withdrawal symptoms is described.", 
    "23": "The omnipresent worry and anxiety that are characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) significantly reduce social and occupational functioning. Yet many clinical investigations of GAD fail to evaluate treatment-related changes in function. As a consequence, many patients who respond to pharmacologic treatment (defined as having a > or = 50% reduction in symptoms) still exhibit subsyndromal symptoms that predispose to relapse. This is particularly true for patients with GAD who have comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. In recent years, the goal of treatment for anxiety disorders has been set toward the achievement of full remission--that is, a virtually asymptomatic state. Remission indicates an improvement not only of symptoms but also of functionality. Benzodiazepines, azapirones, and antidepressants are the three main classes of agents currently used in the treatment of GAD. Some antidepressants have been shown to better facilitate remission. This article will summarize evidence for the clinical utility of pharmacotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatment of GAD.",

Butorphanol was infused continuously into intracerebroventricle (ICV) at a constant rate of 26 nmol/microl/h for 3 days, and the withdrawal from opioid was rendered 7 h after the cessation of infusion. The GABA(A) receptor bindings in rat brain slices were analyzed by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam. In the rats withdrawn from butorphanol, the levels of [3H]muscimol binding were significantly elevated in cortex, thalamus, and part of the hippocampus. The levels of [3H]flunitrazepam binding were elevated in almost all of brain regions including cortex, caudate putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum in the rats withdrawn from butorphanol. The levels of binding of either [3H]muscimol or [3H]flunitrazepam were not changed in the rats tolerant to butorphanol. However, the activity of GABAergic neuron was not found to have been modulated by butorphanol withdrawal, because the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase was not changed markedly either in rats that were tolerant to or withdrawn from butorphanol by Western blot and immunohistochemical data. These results suggest that the withdrawal from butorphanol infusion markedly elevates the binding of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam throughout the brain in a region-specific manner, and that the regulatory mechanisms in butorphanol tolerance and withdrawal may be different.", 
    "29": "Identification of the molecular switch controlling glucocorticoid synthesis might facilitate the development of pharmacological tools to control circulating cortisol levels. The transport of cholesterol from intracellular sources to the inner mitochondrial membrane represents the rate-determining step in the cascade of reactions leading to cortisol synthesis. A key element in this step is the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Several studies have indicated the beneficial effects of Ginkgo biloba on memory and stress control. Using pharmacological, biochemical and proteomic methods, we demonstrated that the standardized Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 and its isolated component ginkgolide B (GKB) inhibit PBR ligand binding and protein expression, resulting in decreased serum corticosterone levels. We further demonstrated that EGb 761- and GKB-induced inhibition of PBR protein is preceded by a decrease in mRNA-levels due to transcriptional suppression of PBR gene expression. Further studies indicated that the action of GKB is mediated by a transcription factor binding to the PBR gene promoter, thereby regulating PBR gene expression. These data indicate that EGb 761-induced inhibition of glucocorticoid production is due to specific transcriptional suppression of the adrenal PBR gene by GKB, and suggest that EGb 761 and GKB might serve as pharmacological tools to control excess glucocorticoid formation.", 
    "30": "Fat has been described to both accelerate and slow intestinal transit. We hypothesized that the fat-induced jejunal brake depends on the combined accelerating effect of CCK and the slowing effect of an opioid pathway. Using a multifistulated model, intestinal transit was measured in four dogs, while 60 mM oleate was delivered into the proximal gut with either 0 or 6 mg naloxone, and 0.1 mg/kg devazepide (a peripheral CCK-A-receptor antagonist) administered intraluminally and intravenously, respectively. In a second study, intestinal transit was measured in seven dogs, while naloxone was delivered intraluminally at 0-, 3-, 6-, or 12-mg doses. Compared to the jejunal brake (marker recovery of 50.1 +/- 2.6%), intestinal transit was slowed by the CCK-A antagonist (36.4 +/- 8.3%; P < 0.05) and accelerated by naloxone (82.0 +/- 6.8%; P < 0.05). The accelerating effect of CCK occurred early in the transit response, while the dose-dependent effect (P < 0.05) of naloxone occurred later. We conclude that fat-induced jejunal brake depends on the early accelerating effect of CCK and the later slowing effect of a naloxone-sensitive opioid pathway.",

This study was set up to evaluate the substances involved, the circumstances, the features and the characteristics of the patients who died due to intentional poisoning. The male to female ratio of these fatal cases was 9 : 1. The median age was 43 years. Two groups of substances were revealed to be associated with fatal outcome. The first group consisted of chemicals (seven lethal cases): cholinesterase inhibitors ( =3), methanol ( =2) and paraquat ( =2). The second group consisted of benzodiazepines (three lethal cases). In the cases of poisoning with chemicals, death was directly related to product toxicity and the severity of the poisoning, whilst with benzodiazepines, which are considered to be relatively safe drugs even when taken in overdose, there was a clear relationship between a fatal outcome and a delay between ingestion and medical support. Product toxicity, complications and a delay in medical support may be considered as predictors for the effectiveness and efficacy of treatment and may influence which medical treatments need to be administered.",

However, no studies have determined whether female moderate drinkers (MD) show a differential response to the subjective and performance effects of benzodiazepines compared to female light drinkers (LD). Fourteen female MD who consumed an average of 36 drinks/month were compared to 14 female LD who consumed an average of 4.2 drinks/month.

Alprazolam impaired performance in a dose-related manner on all performance tasks for both groups of females, whereas buspirone had minimal effects on performance. There were few differences between LD and MD with respect to subjective response or performance impairment following either alprazolam or buspirone. Although MD reported greater ratings of Good Drug Effect and Drug Liking than LD, this was neither dose-related, nor specific to alprazolam. The results of the present study suggest that female MD without a family history of alcoholism experience the same level of performance impairment as female LD, although they tend to report greater positive subjective effects from alprazolam.",

These results indicate that precipitated withdrawal from diazepam injected s.c. but not i.p. produces a negative subjective state and that the conditioned place aversion paradigm may be useful in detecting the negative subjective effects of diazepam withdrawal. In parallel studies, the same s.c. treatment protocol produced an anxiogenic effect in the elevated plus-maze on spontaneous diazepam withdrawal, whereas rats treated with the i.p. protocol displayed no signs of withdrawal anxiety. The results of the present study are consistent with the interpretation that rats withdrawn from chronic i.p. diazepam did not demonstrate a CPA due to the 'repeated withdrawal' experiences induced by the i.p. injection route attenuating the subsequent ability of flumazenil to precipitate a subjective withdrawal state. Pharmacokinetic evidence and previous evidence showing that repeated withdrawal from diazepam in mice attenuates the aversive effects of the withdrawal experience in a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm support this interpretation.", 
    "38": "The properties of a proapoptotic 1,4-benzodiazepine, Bz-423, identified through combinatorial chemistry and phenotype screening are described. Bz-423 rapidly generated superoxide (O(2)(-)) in transformed Ramos B cells. This O(2)(-) response originated from mitochondria prior to mitochondrial transmembrane gradient collapse and opening of the permeability transition pore. Bz-423-induced O(2)(-) functioned as an upstream signal that initiated an apoptotic program characterized by cytochrome c release, mitochondrial depolarization, and caspase activation. Pretreatment of cells with agents that either block the formation of Bz-423-induced O(2)(-) or scavenge free radicals attenuated the death cascade, which demonstrated that cell killing by Bz-423 depends on O(2)(-). Parallels between Ramos cells and germinal center B cells prompted experiments to determine whether Bz-423 had therapeutic activity in vivo. This possibility was tested using the (NZB x NZW)F(1) murine model of lupus, in which the pathologically enhanced survival and expansion of germinal center B cells mediate disease. Administration of Bz-423 for 12 weeks specifically controlled germinal center hyperplasia and reduced the histological evidence of glomerulonephritis. Collectively, these studies define a new structure-function relationship for benzodiazepines and point to a new target and mechanism that could be of value for developing improved drugs to manage systemic lupus erythematosus and related disorders.",

The effect of midazolam on the deleterious consequences of pre-exposure to the context (a non-aversive event) for subsequent fear conditioning was then compared with its effect on fear conditioning. The role of midazolam as an affective context was assessed by performing the testing phase under midazolam. Possible locomotor impairment or long-term effects of midazolam were controlled in additional experiments.",

    "43": "The effects of different cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists (devazepide and L365,260) on cocaine or stress-induced reactivation of cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in rats. After receiving alternate injection of cocaine (10 mg/kg) and saline for 8 consecutive days, the rats spent more time in the drug-paired side (cocaine CPP) on day 9. These animals did not show cocaine CPP on day 31 following saline-paired training daily from days 10 to 30 (21-day extinction). However, a single injection of cocaine (10 mg/kg) or 15 min of intermittent footshock could reinstate CPP on day 32 with significant more time spent in the drug-paired side in comparison with that on day 0. Systemic injection of CCK-A receptor antagonists, devazepide (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before cocaine priming, significantly attenuated cocaine-induced reinstatement of CPP, while CCK-B receptor antagonist, L365,260 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.), did not show a similar effect. In contrast, pretreatment with L365,260 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) but not devazepide (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly blocked stress-induced reinstatement of CPP. In another experiment, CCK-A or B receptor antagonists were infused into nucleus accumbens or amygdala to determine which brain area are involved in the role of different CCK receptors in stress or drug-induced relapse to cocaine seeking. The results show that infusion of the devazepide (10 microg) into the nucleus accumbens significantly inhibited the cocaine-induced reinstatement of CPP, while infusion of devazepide (1 and 10 microg) into amygdala did not affect cocaine-induced reactivation of CPP. Interestingly, infusion of L365,260 (1 and 10 microg) into both nucleus accumbens or amygdala significantly attenuated or blocked stress-induced reinstatement of CPP. These findings demonstrate that CCK-A and B receptor have different roles in relapse to drug craving and further suggest that the brain areas involved in the CCK receptors on reinstatement of drug seeking are not identical. CCK-B receptor antagonists might be of some value in the treatment and prevention of relapse to stress-induced to drug craving following long-term detoxification.", 
    "44": "The relative reinforcing effects of different doses of benzodiazepines were determined by giving rhesus monkeys concurrent access to different diazepam and midazolam concentrations. For each monkey a dose response function was obtained using three drug concentrations: low (L), intermediate (I), and high (H). The benzodiazepine and the water vehicle were concurrently available under independent fixed-ratio (FR) schedules. After establishing that each concentration was a reinforcer in comparison to vehicle, relative preference for the different concentrations was examined by making pairs of concentrations concurrently available under independent FR schedules. Three pairs were studied (H vs. L, H vs. I, and I vs. L). With both drugs, higher concentrations maintained greater response rates than lower concentrations. Thus, relative reinforcing effects increased with dose. These findings are similar to those obtained with other reinforcing drugs and provide further evidence that benzodiazepines share significant characteristics with other drug reinforcers. Importantly, absolute response rates (responses per session) obtained when only one drug dose was present were not reliably predictive of subsequent preferences for the dose. Both benzodiazepines served as effective reinforcers in that consistent levels of responding were maintained across doses and above vehicle levels under concurrent FR 32 schedules. As with other reinforcing drugs, the reinforcing effects of benzodiazepines increase with increases in dose over a broad range of values.", 
    "45": "The search for novel anxiolytics devoid of undesirable side-effects typical of classical benzodiazepines (BDZs) has been intense, and flavonoids, as a relative new class of ligands, have been shown to possess anxiolytic effects in vivo. The present study evaluated the pharmacological properties of a naturally occurring monoflavonoid, 5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone or wogonin. The affinity (K(i)) of wogonin for the benzodiazepine site (BZD-S) on the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor complex was 0.92 microM. Using electrophysiological techniques, we showed that wogonin enhanced the GABA-activated current in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, and in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant rat GABA(A) receptors, the enhancement was partially reversed by the co-application of a 1 microM concentration of the BZD-S antagonist anexate (Ro15-1788). Acute toxicity and behavioral effects were examined in mice. Acute lethal activity was low, with an LD(50) of 3.9 g/kg. Oral administration of wogonin (7.5 to 30 mg/kg) elicited an anxiolytic response that was similar to that elicited by diazepam in the elevated plus-maze; a dose-dependent increase in open arm entries and time spent in open arms was observed. More importantly, its anxiolytic effect was blocked by the co-administration of Ro15-1788. In the holeboard test, not only did wogonin-treated mice experience an increased number of head-dips but they also spent more time at it, showing no signs of sedation. Furthermore, wogonin did not cause myorelaxant effects in the horizontal wire test. Taken together, these data suggest that wogonin exerts its anxiolytic effect through positive allosteric modulation of the GABA(A) receptor complex via interaction at the BZD-S. Its anxiolytic effect was not accompanied by sedative and myorelaxant side-effects typical of BDZs.",

Application of the microglial inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS, at 100 ng/mL for 3 h), induced enhancement of the expressions of the inducible enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). PK11195 (at 50 microm) significantly inhibited the LPS-induced up-regulation of both inflammatory factors; at a lower concentration of PK11195 (2 microm) expression of TNF-alpha, but not COX-2, was reduced. Production of both factors, using immunocytochemistry for COX-2 and ELISA for TNF-alpha, was markedly reduced with 50 microm of PK11195 added to LPS solution. Acute application of LPS induced a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+[Ca2+]i exhibiting both a slow development and recovery in kinetic behavior. This increase in [Ca2+]i consisted primarily of a Ca2+ influx component accompanied by a smaller mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores. In the presence of PK11195, the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i response induced by LPS was reduced by 54%. Another mitochondrial agent cyclosporin A (CsA), which also acts at the permeability transition pore (PTP) of mitochondrial membrane but at a site different from the PBR, was ineffective in reducing either the LPS-induced expression of COX-2 and TNF-alpha or the endotoxin increase in [Ca2+]i. These results indicate that the mitochondrial effector PK11195 is a specific and effective agent for inhibiting LPS-induced microglial expressions of COX-2 and TNF-alpha and that modulation of Ca2+-mediated signaling pathways could be involved in the anti-inflammatory actions.", 
    "69": "Depressed elderly persons frequently have concurrent symptoms of anxiety or comorbid anxiety disorders. Such comorbidity is associated with a more severe presentation of depressive illness, including greater suicidality. Additionally, most antidepressant treatment studies in the elderly have found poorer treatment outcomes in those with comorbid anxiety (including delayed or diminished response and increased likelihood of dropout from treatment). While antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic agents are efficacious for late-life depression, there is no evidence that either class is superior, in terms of efficacy or tolerability, in the treatment of anxious depression. Rather, the amount and quality of clinical management, and not the particular medication chosen, appears to influence the likelihood of remission or treatment withdrawal in anxious depressed elderly patients. Co-prescription of benzodiazepines, typically lorazepam, is also warranted in some cases for severe anxiety or insomnia, but carries the risk of cognitive or motor impairment. It is our experience that close clinical monitoring, together with maximization of antidepressant treatment (by maximising dosage, augmenting or switching agents in cases of partial or no response, and/or adding psychotherapy) will almost always result in remission of depressive symptoms, together with improvement of anxiety, in these individuals. Therefore, optimism should be maintained when treating the depressed elderly individual, even when comorbid anxiety is present.",

The rat brains were perfused with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing test compounds in the absence or presence of a specific P-glycoprotein inhibitor (GF-120918). Brain samples were collected after perfusion and processed by a capillary depletion method. After liquid phase extraction with acetonitrile, samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Linear uptake kinetics of DADLE and its cyclic prodrugs was observed within the range of 60 to 240 s of perfusion. The apparent permeability coefficient (P(app)) of DADLE across the BBB was very low (<10(-7) cm/s), probably due to its unfavorable physicochemical properties (e.g., charge, hydrophilicity, and high hydrogen-bonding potential). All three cyclic prodrugs, however, also exhibited low membrane permeation (P(app) <10(-7) cm/s) in spite of their more favorable physicochemical properties (e.g., no charge, high hydrophobicity, and low hydrogen-bonding potential). Inclusion of GF-120918 (10 microM) in the perfusates fully inhibited the P-gp activity in the BBB and dramatically increased the P(app) values of AOA-DADLE, CA-DADLE, and OMCA-DADLE by approximately 50-, 460-, and 170-fold, respectively. In contrast, GF-120918 had no effect on the P(app) value of DADLE. In addition, the observed bioconversions of the prodrugs to DADLE in the rat brains after 240-s perfusion were very low (5.1% from AOA-DADLE, 0.6% from CA-DADLE, and 0.2% from OMCA-DADLE), which was consistent with the in vitro bioconversion rates determined previously in rat brain homogenates.",

Considering the GABA shift, the intrinsic modulatory activity of RWJ-51204 is lower than that of full agonist anxiolytics (lorazepam, diazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam) but similar to partial agonists (bretazenil, abecarnil, panadiplon, and imidazenil). RWJ-51204 was orally active in anxiolytic efficacy tests; pentylenetetrazole induced seizure inhibition in mice (ED(50) = 0.04 mg/kg), Vogel conflict in rats (ED(50) = 0.36 mg/kg), elevated plus-maze in rats (minimal effective dose = 0.1 mg/kg), and conflict in squirrel monkeys (ED(50) = 0.49 mg/kg). RWJ-51204 attenuated chlordiazepoxide-induced motor impairment in mice. Usually, RWJ-51204 was more potent than reference anxiolytics in rodent efficacy tests but less potent in monkey conflict. Usually, the slope of the dose-response lines for RWJ-51204 was more shallow than the full agonist anxiolytics but steeper than partial agonists in efficacy tests but typically shallow in tests for central nervous system side effects. In monkeys only mild or moderate sedation was observed at doses equivalent to 20 or 40 times the anxiolytic ED(50). RWJ-51204 fits into the partial agonist class of GABA(A) receptor modulators. In conclusion, RWJ-51204 exhibits a profile in in vitro experiments and in animal models, in mice and monkeys (but not in rats), suggesting that it has a profile of anxiolytic activity associated with less sedation, motor impairment, or muscle relaxation than currently available GABA(A) receptor modulators, i.e., the benzodiazepines.", 
    "82": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18-kDa high-affinity cholesterol and drug ligand-binding protein involved in various cell functions, including cholesterol transport and steroid biosynthesis. To aid our investigation of the biological function of PBR, we have set out to identify functional antagonists. By screening phage display libraries, we have identified peptides that displace the high-affinity PBR benzodiazepine drug ligand, Ro5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam). Among these peptides, STPHSTP was the most potent (IC(50) = 10 microM). All of the isolated peptides showed a conserved motif STXXXXP. The role of these peptides in Leydig cell steroidogenesis was examined using a transducible peptide composed of the TAT domain of human immunodeficiency virus and the peptides under investigation. Synthesized peptides efficiently transduced into MA-10 Leydig cells, and the peptide TAT-STPHSTP inhibited Ro5-4864- and human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated steroid production in a dose-dependent manner (ED(50) = 5 microM). TAT-STPHSTP behaved as a competitive PBR antagonist, which did not affect 22R-hydroxycholesterol-supported steroidogenesis.

    "83": "Ligands binding to the benzodiazepine-binding site in gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors may allosterically modulate function. Depending upon the ligand, the coupling can either be positive (flunitrazepam), negative (Ro15-4513), or neutral (flumazenil). Specific amino acid determinants of benzodiazepine binding affinity and/or allosteric coupling have been identified within GABA(A) receptor alpha and gamma subunits that localize the binding site at the subunit interface. Previous photolabeling studies with [(3)H]flunitrazepam identified a primary site of incorporation at alpha(1)His-102, whereas studies with [(3)H]Ro15-4513 suggested incorporation into the alpha(1) subunit at unidentified amino acids C-terminal to alpha(1)His-102. To determine the site(s) of photoincorporation by Ro15-4513, we affinity-purified ( approximately 200-fold) GABA(A) receptor from detergent extracts of bovine cortex, photolabeled it with [(3)H]Ro15-4513, and identified (3)H-labeled amino acids by N-terminal sequence analysis of subunit fragments generated by sequential digestions with a panel of proteases. The patterns of (3)H release seen after each digestion of the labeled fragments determined the number of amino acids between the cleavage site and labeled residue, and the use of sequential proteolytic fragmentation identified patterns of cleavage sites unique to the different alpha subunits. Based upon this radiochemical sequence analysis, [(3)H]Ro15-4513 was found to selectively label the homologous tyrosines alpha(1)Tyr-210, alpha(2)Tyr-209, and alpha(3)Tyr-234, in GABA(A) receptors containing those subunits.

    "84": "The adrenocortical response to hypoxia may be a critical component of the adaptation to this common neonatal stress. Little is known about adrenal function in vivo in hypoxic neonates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate adrenocortical responses to ACTH in suckling rat pups exposed to hypoxia from birth to 5-7 days of age compared with normoxic controls. We also evaluated potential cellular controllers of steroidogenic function in situ. In 7-day-old pups at 0800, hypoxia from birth resulted in increased basal (12.2 +/- 1.4 ng/ml; n = 12) and ACTH-stimulated (94.0 +/- 9.4 ng/ml; n = 14) corticosterone levels compared with normoxic controls (basal = 8.3 +/- 0.5 ng/ml; n = 11; stimulated = 51.3 +/- 3.8 ng/ml; n = 8). This augmentation occurred despite no significant difference in plasma ACTH levels in normoxic vs. hypoxic pups before (85 +/- 4 vs. 78 +/- 8 pg/ml) or after (481 +/- 73 vs. 498 +/- 52 pg/ml) porcine ACTH injection (20 microg/kg). This effect was similar in the afternoon at 6 days of age and even greater at 5 days of age at 0800. The aldosterone response to ACTH was not augmented by exposure to hypoxia from birth. Adrenocortical hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mRNA was undetectable by RT-PCR. Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein in adrenal subcapsules (zona fasciculata/reticularis) was augmented by exposure to hypoxia; this effect was greatest at 5 days of age. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) protein was also increased at 6 and 7 days of age in pups exposed to hypoxia from birth. We conclude that hypoxia from birth results in an augmentation of the corticosterone but not aldosterone response to ACTH. This effect appears to be mediated at least in part by an increase in controllers of mitochondrial cholesterol transport (StAR and PBR) and to occur independently of measurable changes in endogenous plasma ACTH. The augmentation of the corticosterone response to acute increases in ACTH in hypoxic pups is likely to be an important component of the overall physiological adaptation to hypoxia in the neonate.", 
    "85": "Type A CCK receptor (CCKAR) antagonists differing in blood-brain barrier permeability [devazepide penetrates; the dicyclohexylammonium salt of Nalpha-3-quinolinoyl-d-Glu-N,N-dipentylamide (A-70104) does not] were used to test the hypothesis that duodenal nutrient-induced inhibition of gastric emptying is mediated by CCKARs located peripheral to the blood-brain barrier. Rats received A-70104 (700 or 3,000 nmol. kg(-1). h(-1) iv) or devazepide (2.5 micromol/kg iv) and either a 15-min intravenous infusion of CCK-8 (3 nmol. kg(-1). h(-1)) or duodenal infusion of casein, peptone, Intralipid, or maltose. Gastric emptying of saline was measured during the last 5 min of each infusion. A-70104 and devazepide abolished the gastric emptying response to a maximal inhibitory dose of CCK-8. Each of the macronutrients inhibited gastric emptying. A-70104 and devazepide attenuated inhibitory responses to each macronutrient. Intravenous injection of a CCK antibody to immunoneutralize circulating CCK had no effect on peptone or Intralipid-induced responses. Thus endogenous CCK appears to act in part by a paracrine or neurocrine mechanism at CCKARs peripheral to the blood-brain barrier to inhibit gastric emptying.", 
    "86": "In parts of the developing world, pesticide poisoning causes more deaths than infectious diseases. Use of pesticides is poorly regulated and often dangerous; their easy availability also makes them a popular method of self-harm. In 1985, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) produced a voluntary code of conduct for the pesticide industry in an attempt to limit the harmful effects of pesticides. Unfortunately, a lack of adequate government resources in the developing world makes this code ineffective, and thousands of deaths continue today. WHO has recommended that access to highly toxic pesticides be restricted--where this has been done, suicide rates have fallen. Since an Essential Drugs List was established in 1977, use of a few essential drugs has rationalised drug use in many regions. An analogous Minimum Pesticides List would identify a restricted number of less dangerous pesticides to do specific tasks within an integrated pest management system. Use of safer pesticides should result in fewer deaths, just as the change from barbiturates to benzodiazepines has reduced the number of deaths from pharmaceutical self-poisoning.", 
    "87": "Treatment of central neuropathic pain (CP) following lesions of the CNS is a great challenge to the clinician. Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that neuronal hyperexcitability in damaged areas of the central nervous system plays a major role in the development of CP. Anticonvulsants are thought to act by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition, decreasing abnormal neuronal hyperexcitability by modulating sodium and calcium channels or by inhibiting excitatory amino acid actions. The resulting inhibition of excess neuronal activity is thought to be the basis for the use of anticonvulsants in epilepsy as well as neuropathic pain. Both first-generation anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phenytoin, benzodiazepines, valproate and carbamazepine) and second-generation anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate) are used in CP conditions. However, few randomised controlled trials on the treatment of this condition have been published. Present suggestions for anticonvulsant treatment of CP are lamotrigine as the first choice, followed by gabapentin or carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine. These compounds are considered as effective as the antidepressant amitriptyline.", 
    "88": "The aim of this paper is to suggest Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging as a useful tool in prenatal diagnosis. Although ultrasonography (US) is the imaging technique of choice for prenatal screening, in cases of complex malformations US findings may be sub-optimal and give rise to diagnostic difficulties requiring further investigation. Our study is focused on non-central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities of the foetus imaged using the ultrafast sequence EXPRESS.", 
    "89": "38 women whose foetuses were between 21-34 gestational age were studied. Indications for the examinations included the evaluation of non-CNS abnormalities in 25 cases. Foetal MR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T system (Edge, Marconi Medical System Italia SpA, Vimercate, MI) with the half-Fourier, single-shot, fast spin-echo EXPRESS sequence. Mild maternal and foetal sedation was obtained by oral administration of benzodiazepine (1 mg).", 
    "90": "In the 25 foetuses investigated for non-CNS pathologies the abnormalities were localised in the chest (9), abdomen (15) and extremities (1). The MR imaging diagnoses were: in the chest - congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) (5), congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) (1), hydrothorax (1), cystic lymphangioma (1), Jeune syndrome (1); in the abdomen - 10 cases of urinary tract diseases - polycystic kidney (4), crossed renal ectopia (2), unilateral renal agenesis (1), solitary pelvic kidney (1), bilateral stenosis of ureteropelvic junction (1), duplex collecting system in association with controlateral hydroureteronephrosis (1)#151;5 cases of non-urinary tract pathologies#151;cystic lymphangioma of the liver (1), abdominal cystic lymphangioma (1), gastroschisis (1), gastric duplication (1), cavernous haemangioma of the liver (1); in the extremities - longitudinal hemimelia (1).", 
    "91": "In our experience MR is to be considered a useful though adjunct study to prenatal US particularly in the evaluation of lung parenchyma, congenital diaphragmatic viscera herniation, thoracic masses, pleural effusion, abdominal cystic masses, and urinary tract malformations. The ultrafast EXPRESS sequence enables a complete study to be performed in a very short time; as a consequence the examination is well tolerated by the patient. Currently there is no legislation which regulates the use of magnetic fields in MR, only a series of recommendations based on studies on animal embryos and foetuses, on pregnant women exposed to magnetic fields and follow-up studies of children exposed to MR during gestation. Therefore the decision to proceed with foetal MR should be made on a case-by-case basis in close consultation with the referring obstetrician. Considering the results, in our opinion the potential of MR in the evaluation of a wide variety of non-CNS foetal diseases will increase in the near future.", 
    "92": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the antidepressants most widely prescribed today, exert specific action against various anxiety disorders and have an excellent acceptability profile. In addition, anxiety problems are commonly seen in depression, in the form of either characterised anxiety disorders or associated anxious symptoms. Such symptoms of anxiety result in increased risk of suicide and appear to be associated with development of more severe and chronic depressive disorders. Because of the adverse effects associated with anxiolytics, in particular benzodiazepines, their indications have been restricted. Consequently, first-line drug therapy for anxiety symptoms associated with depression involves selection of an antidepressant having anxiolytic properties. Specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly favoured at present since they have a less pronounced sedative effect than the tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, maprotiline). Escitalopram, the active enantiomer of citalopram, has demonstrated efficacy and rapidity of action upon depressive symptoms seen in major depressive episodes. Global analysis of three studies comparing citalopram and escitalopram with a placebo in depressive disorders allowed specific investigation of the activity of these molecules upon the anxiety component of depressive disorders. Anxiety was quantitatively evaluated using item 6 (inner tension) of the MADRS, and for two of the three studies, using the anxiety sub-score of the HAM-D as well as the HAM-A total score. The results for the two active molecules demonstrate significant superiority in comparison with the placebo. Furthermore, in the case of escitalopram, this improvement appeared significant as of the first week of treatment (p<0.05); by the end of the second week of treatment, the degree of significance was even more pronounced (p<0.001). The tolerability profile of these two active substances was very good. These studies thus demonstrate the efficacy of escitalopram against anxiety symptoms associated with depression, together with particularly interesting rapidity of action. Use of an antidepressant with proven activity against anxiety accompanying depression avoids the need for co-prescription of tranquillizers, which themselves are not devoid of adverse effects.", 
    "93": "Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been evaluated in the United States and in a few other countries. MMT has been developed in France since 1995, and over 5 000 patients receive this treatment. However no French study has yet been published on the efficacy of MMT as assessed by a validated scale. Retention in treatment for one year has been considered as a threshold to define maintenance of treatment benefits after discharge from a methadone program; determination of retention predictors is important. Over a three year period, we evaluated patients at admission and during treatment using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and urine drug screening was performed weekly; 95 patients (66 males and 29 females) were evaluated at intake. Their mean age was 30.2 5.5, and they had used opioids for a mean of 10.6 5.7 years. Their ASI severity scores for drugs were over 5, showing a clear need for treatment. Female patients differed from males only in the employment-finances ASI score; 43 patients completed at least one year of treatment, after which their drug and legal composite scores significantly improved. No significant changes in their consumption of cocaine, alcohol, benzodiazepines or cannabis were found, but they smoked fewer cigarettes at 12 months. Demographics, ASI severity scores, and history of suicide attempts did not differentiate one-year completers from dropouts (n=16). However, dropouts had used more buprenorphine and less methadone in the 30 days preceding their admission, and they received a lower dose of methadone during treatment. Our population is comparable to other French MMT populations; they enter treatment after a long history of opioid dependence. The improvement found on the ASI composite scores is also similar to the improvement described in other international studies. Dropouts in our study seem to be more treatment-resistant patients, in the sense that they had used more buprenorphine before intake and were not stabilized with it; and they may have had a more negative attitude towards methadone.",

The questionnaire was first tested in a pilot study through ten patients. Drug addicts were followed-up in 8 drug abuse treatment centres among which 2 networks of general practitioners in Paris region, in Strasbourg region and in Nice region. The investigators were general practitioners, psychologists, psychiatrists, educators, nurses. All drugs addict which reported use buprenorphine were seen in treatment centre and were 18 years old or older, were eligible. Drugs addict with severe mental disorders, unable to answer the questions were excluded. Respondents received an assurance of confidentiality and informed consent was obtained.

Most of them were unmarried (67.5%). They had no real employment (56.5%). The mean age at the first use opiate was 19.5 (SD: 4.5). The mean age at the first heroin injection was 20.7 (SD: 4.6). At the time of interview, most of drugs addict used more than two types of drugs (42.6%). Many associations with buprenorphine are described particularly associations to alcohol (41.2%), benzodiazepines (40%), cocaine (12.4%), heroin (7.8%), crack (7.2%); most of these subjects getting buprenorphine without any medical prescription. Most drug addicts had asked themselves for using buprenorphine (61.0%). Near fifty per cent (49.5%) injected buprenorphine. Among them, 39.6% injected this substance the first time they used it. Curiosity (72.8%), need for injection (69.0%), sensation seeking (49.0%) were reasons given by drug addicts for buprenorphine injection. Others reasons were given: an inadequate dosage of sublingual buprenorphine, to find buprenorphine in black market. Buprenorphine injection took place in the secure environment (57.5%). Drug addicts were not alone when they injected (53.6%). The introducer was an buprenorphine user (57%). The first buprenorphine injection sensation was not pleasant (61%), although injection of buprenorphine is usually performed by 80% of them.

Some misappropriations and wrong uses have been seen, the most frequent and sever being using tablets for injections. The prevalence of buprenorphine injection is high among drug addicts. The results of the study show that the first buprenorphine Injection takes places place a few time after the first buprenorphine use. The codependance to other substances is one of risk markers for intravenous use of buprenorphine tablets and the dangers of polyintoxication were known. Curiosity, need for injection favour buprenorphine injection. But, the sensation seeking brings on the drug addict too. The rather loose frame of prescription, a lack of training among general practitioners, the fragility of the specialises network, the complexities in the care of drug users which not resumed by a substitution must take into consideration. The drug addict's career, the subject's environment and the circumstances of the buprenorphine injection have not been previously described. However their knowledge are of prime necessity to prevent this abnormal use and to find the best treatment for drug addicts.",

    "100": "Although the administration of sedatives is a commonplace activity in the ICU, few guidelines are available to aid the clinician in this practice. The first principle of sedative administration is to define the specific problem requiring sedation and to rationally choose the drug and depth of sedation appropriate for the indication. Next, the clinician must recognize the diverse and often unpredictable effects of critical illness on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Failure to recognize these effects may lead initially to inadequate sedation and subsequently to drug accumulation. Drug accumulation may result in prolonged encephalopathy and mechanical ventilation and may mask the development of neurologic or intra-abdominal complications. Daily interruption of continuous sedative infusions is a simple and effective way of addressing this problem. A glossary of sedative drugs commonly used in the ICU is included in this review.", 
    "101": "(R,S)-Oxazepam is a 1,4-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug that is metabolized primarily by hepatic glucuronidation. In previous studies, S-oxazepam (but not R-oxazepam) was shown to be polymorphically glucuronidated in humans. The aim of the present study was to identify UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms mediating R- and S-oxazepam glucuronidation in human liver, with the long term objective of elucidating the molecular genetic basis for this drug metabolism polymorphism. All available recombinant UGT isoforms were screened for R- and S-oxazepam glucuronidation activities. Enzyme kinetic parameters were then determined in representative human liver microsomes (HLMs) and in UGTs that showed significant activity. Of 12 different UGTs evaluated, only UGT2B15 showed significant S-oxazepam glucuronidation. Furthermore, the apparent K(m) for UGT2B15 (29-35 microM) was similar to values determined for HLMs (43-60 microM). In contrast, R-oxazepam was glucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Although apparent K(m) values for HLMs (256-303 microM) were most similar to UGT2B7 (333 microM) rather than UGT1A9 (12 microM), intrinsic clearance values for UGT1A9 were 10 times higher than for UGT2B7. A common genetic variation results in aspartate (UGT2B15*1) or tyrosine (UGT2B15*2) at position 85 of the UGT2B15 protein. Microsomes from human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells overexpressing UGT2B15*1 showed 5 times higher S-oxazepam glucuronidation activity than did UGT2B15*2 microsomes. Similar results were obtained for other substrates, including eugenol, naringenin, 4-methylumbelliferone, and androstane-3alpha-diol. In conclusion, S-oxazepam is stereoselectively glucuronidated by UGT2B15, whereas R-oxazepam is glucuronidated by multiple UGT isoforms. Allelic variation associated with the UGT2B15 gene may explain polymorphic S-oxazepam glucuronidation in humans.", 
    "102": "Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of several interventions to decrease the progression of myopia. These include devices that alter the perception of the visual environment and pharmacological treatments. There is no conclusive evidence thus far that alteration of the pattern of spectacle wear, bifocals, ocular hypotensives, or contact lenses retards the progression of myopia. Several randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that the rate of progression of myopia is lower in children given atropine eye drops than those given placebo. However, atropine is associated with short term side effects such as photophobia and possible long term adverse events including light induced retinal damage and cataract formation. Other more selective antimuscarinic agents such as pirenzipine are presently being evaluated. Further well conducted randomised clinical trials with large sample sizes and adequate follow up designed to evaluate treatments to retard the progression of myopia should be conducted, since the identification of an effective intervention may have a greater public health impact on the burden and morbidity from myopia than the few treatments currently available.",

    "104": "Early results from our laboratory have demonstrated a positive correlation between increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity and development of tolerance to hypolocomotive effect of Diazepam (DZ). We have found recently, that pre-exposure to DZ administration context impairs increase of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in conjunction with tolerance to DZ. These findings have suggested, that the tolerance to DZ is context specific. Furthermore, the hippocampus can be critically involved in the behavioral expression of conditioned tolerance to DZ. The results of the present investigation show that animals chronically treated with DZ for 18 days exhibit withdrawal signs, evaluated as an increased anxiety in an elevated plus maze. These animals also show, a facilitation in the threshold to induce long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation. These phenomena have a strong dependency on the drug administration context, since both are reversed after the introduction of some changes in the drug administration environment. Furthermore, the alteration of some environmental cues increased the locomotive activity in animals that did not show anxiety as a withdrawal signs. We conclude that a common neural system could underlie the behavioral expression of the conditioned tolerance and dependence on DZ.",

    "106": "A new approach for eliminating the redundant variables in the multivariable data matrix encountered in QSAR studies, minor latent variable perturbation (MLVP)-PLS method has been proposed. In the latent variable (LV) space, the minor latent variables (LVs) with small covariances are mainly formulated by linear combinations of the redundant variables including information-deficient and highly correlative ones, while the major LVs with large covariances are mainly contributed by the informative variables. Deleting a minor LV, which is equivalent to a perturbation for LV space, could make the redundant variables not well be represented in LV subspace, leading to strong variation of their PLS regression coefficients. The informative variables could still be normally represented in LV subspace with the PLS regression coefficients remaining relatively stable. MLVP-PLS utilizes this fact to discriminate the informative and redundant variables. It gradually identifies and eliminates the redundant variables according to the relative variation of PLS regression coefficients after perturbations are given. The elimination process is terminated according to some proposed criteria. Applying the method to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies on TIBO derivatives as potential anti-HIV drugs has demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach. A deeper insight into the effect of different structural parameters on the bio-activity of TIBO derivatives has been reached.",

People who seek help are those whose lives are severely affected by their avoidance behaviour. Fear of flying can be treated, and in particular, procedures for coping with fear, as developed in behavioural therapy are employed in the course of treatment. 'Systematic desensitization' is particularly suitable for dealing with specific flying phobia. 'Exposure according to the reaction management model' is indicated in the case of patients in whom fear of flying is an expression of panic attacks. A variety of pharmacological therapy measures are available which aim at influencing the vegetative reaction to phobic situations (benzodiazepine, antidepressants, beta-blockers). However, the effectiveness of such medications is subject to controversy.", 
    "108": "A gentle long-lasting handling produces persistent neurochemical and behavioural changes and attenuates the impairment in the behavioural reactivity to novelty induced by the prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ) in adult male rat progeny. This study investigated the consequences of a late prenatal treatment with three GABA/BDZ R agonists (DZ) alprazolam (ALP) and zolpidem (ZOLP)), on different stress-related behavioural patterns, in non-handled (NH), short-lasting handled (SLH) and long-lasting handled (LLH) adult male rats exposed to forced swim test (FST), acoustic startle reflex (ASR) and Vogel test (VT). The effects on motor activity were evaluated in the open field and in the Skinner box. The seizure sensitivity to picrotoxin (PTX) was investigated as an index of the functional state of GABA/BDZ Rs. A single daily s.c. injection of DZ (1.25-2.50 mg/kg) and ALP (0.125-0.250 mg/kg) over gestational days 14-20 induced a decrease in immobility time in the FST in NH rats, no change in SLH rats and an increase in LLH rats; DZ induced an increase in the peak amplitude of the ASR in NH rats, no change in SLH rats and a reduction in LLH rats; ALP was ineffective in all groups. DZ and ALP reduced the number of punished licks in the VT in NH, SLH and LLH rats while the unpunished licks were not modified. DZ decreased locomotion and the lever pressing responses while ALP increased them. DZ and ALP increased the seizure sensitivity to PTX (2.5-4.0 mg/kg i.p.). These findings indicate a convergence on anxiety-related behaviours in the effects of prenatal exposure to DZ and ALP and a differentiation on motor activity. Long-lasting handling was able to overcompensate the increased behavioural stress reactivity induced by the prenatal exposure to DZ and ALP.", 
    "109": "Gradual increases in the electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus produces progressive aversive responses from vigilance, through freezing, until escape. These responses are probably mediated by excitatory amino acids (EAA) mechanisms as microinjection of glutamate into the inferior colliculus can trigger freezing responses while microinjections of NMDA cause a mixture of immobility and escape responses. Moreover, it has been shown that the neural substrates for defensive behavior in this structure are regulated by GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms. Indeed, these responses are depressed by muscimol and midazolam locally injected into the inferior colliculus. In this work we were interested in knowing how GABAergic mechanisms interact with the EAA-mediated neural substrates of aversion generated at the inferior colliculus level. We found that while intraperitoneal injections of muscimol caused the expected antiaversive effects, unexpectedly systemic injections of muscimol enhanced the aversive reactions induced by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus of rats. Local injections into the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus of GDEE-an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist-inhibited whereas AP7-a NMDA receptor antagonist-did not influence these responses. It is suggested that systemic injections of muscimol inhibit GABAergic inputs to the inferior colliculus. The removal of these inhibitory influences reduce the well-known tonic inhibitory control exerted by GABAergic mechanisms on the neural substrates of aversion of the inferior colliculus. Activation of these neural substrates by fast-acting AMPA/kainate receptors trigger the initial steps of the defense reaction in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus.",

The episodes of NCSE presented as an acute confusional state with mild myoclonus. Ictal EEG showed generalized spike-wave or polyspike wave activity. The clinical symptoms and the EEG responded promptly to IV benzodiazepines and patients remained well controlled with dose reduction of LTG (in one patient) or discontinuation of LTG (in two patients).",

However, in areas underserved by mental health professionals, the treatment of depressed patients becomes challenging. Furthermore, patients living in rural areas and communities underserved by health professionals are at risk for high levels of depressive symptoms and low access to care. Physicians (N = 58) of multiple nonpsychiatric specialties in Imperial County, a rural underserved area in California, were surveyed to ascertain their preferred strategies in the management of depressed patients. More than half (57%) of the respondents preferred to either refer patients to a mental health specialist (p < .01) as the only strategy, or in combination with counseling, prescribing medication, or both. The most commonly reported form of counseling was of a supportive nature. The most commonly prescribed drugs were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (in order of frequency:fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine). Tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines were identified as first-line drugs by some pediatricians and surgeons. The results of this study support the need for enhanced postgraduate training in the treatment of depression for nonpsychiatric physicians, and greater exposure of psychiatric residents to rural psychiatry.",

This is a retrospective review of the first 500 paediatric patients given ketamine for conscious sedation. Ketamine was given, either intramuscularly (3-4 mg/kg) or intravenously (1-2 mg/kg) together with atropine (0.02 mg/kg), with or without intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg). The main indications for giving ketamine were for laceration repair, especially those of the lip, tongue and buccal mucosa (54.4%); manipulation and reduction of upper limb fractures (25.8%); incision and drainage of abscesses (12%), removal of foreign bodies (6.4%) and a potpourri of other conditions. Seventy-five point six percent of our patients were less than six years old and the male to female ratio was 1.9:1. Ninety-six percent of our patients were discharged home well and only one child (0.2%) was admitted for observation possibly as a consequence of ketamine. We find ketamine to be a relatively effective drug for use for conscious sedation in children.", 
    "124": "A catatonic patient without known relatives or advance directives faced possible death without electroconvulsive treatment (ECT). The authors describe using medication to restore capacity to permit the patient to give critical history and consent to potentially life-saving treatment. Even had a proxy been available, the jurisdiction in which he fell ill forbade substituted judgment for ECT, permitting only recipients themselves to consent. While emergent ECT was not specifically forbidden in this jurisdiction, a full curative course presumably could not have been administered without some form of consent. THus, the intervention prevented a treatment delay while the court was petitioned and also avoided having to insert a judge into the doctor-patient relationship. This case focuses on a specific condition, medication, and jurisdiction, but it outlines a general paradigm of pharmacologic intervention to restore temporary capacity. We encourage physicians to identify situations in which medication can create temporary \"lucid intervals,\" thereby restoring patient autonomy and self-determination that would otherwise be lost to proxies or courts of law.", 
    "125": "Local anesthesia can be considered adequate in 22% cases, which is explained by the absence of inhibitory effect on allogens, persistence of psychoemotional tension, and effector reactions. Therefore it is recommended to potentiate local anesthesia by a drug complex including analgesic ketrodole, tranquilizer diazepam, and alpha-adrenoagonist clofelin, used transbuccally 8-10 min before anesthesia. This pretreatment 3-fold increased the adequacy of local anesthesia for tooth removal and pulp extirpation.", 
    "126": "In health, microglia reside as quiescent guardian cells ubiquitously, but isolated without any cell-cell contacts amongst themselves, throughout the normal CNS. In disease, however, they act as swift \"sensors\" for pathological events, including subtle ones without any obvious structural damage. Once activated, microglia show a territorially highly restricted involvement in the disease process. This property, peculiar to microglia, confers to them diagnostic value for the accurate spatial localisation of any active disease process, acute or chronic. In the brain, the isoquinoline PK11195, a ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site (PBBS), binds with relative cellular selectivity to activated, but not resting, microglia. Labelled with carbon-11, (R)-PK11195 and positron emission tomography (PET) have been used for the study of inflammatory and neurodegenerative brain disease in vivo. These studies demonstrate meaningfully distributed patterns of regional [(11)C](R)-PK11195 signal increases that correlate with clinically observed loss of function. Increased [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding closely mirrors the histologically well-described activation of microglia in the penumbra of focal lesions, as well as in the distant, anterograde, and retrograde projection areas of the lesioned neural pathway. There is also some indication that in long-standing alterations of a neural network with persistent abnormal input, additional signals of glial activation may also emerge in transsynaptic areas. These data suggest that the injured brain is less static than commonly thought and shows subtle glial responses even in macroanatomically stable appearing regions. This implies that glial activation is not solely a sign of tissue destruction, but possibly of disease-induced adaptation or plasticity as well. Whilst further technological and methodological advances are necessary to achieve routine clinical value and feasibility, a systematic attempt to image glial cells in vivo is likely to furnish valuable information on the cellular pathology of CNS diseases and their progression within the distributed neural architecture of the brain.",

In the control group 2.3 (2.0-2.6) mg kg-1 propofol caused LOC compared with 1.3 (1.1-1.5) mg kg-1 in the group pretreated with midazolam (P < 0.001). Pa amplitude decreased by 60% in the control group and by 54% in the midazolam group while Nb latency increased by 24% in the control group and by 32% in the midazolam group following LOC.

During the recovery phase in Group P, the coefficients were respectively 0.946 and 0.702 (P < 0.001).

    "136": "Recently, reference tissue methods have been proposed to estimate binding potential from PET data. A reference region without specifically bound ligand is used as an indirect input function to enable the expression of the time-concentration curve of a region of interest using a compartment model. However, PET dopaminergic and serotoninergic studies have shown differences between binding potential (BP) values obtained with reference tissue methods and those obtained with conventional kinetic modeling using an arterial input function. In this study, we measured the BP values for the benzodiazepine receptors in seven subjects using PET [(11)C]flumazenil and SPECT [(123)I]iomazenil radioligands. We compared the BP values obtained using the reference tissue methods with those obtained using the conventional kinetic method. These values were also compared with the absolute value of receptor density, B'(max). For the PET studies, a multi-injection approach employing labeled and unlabeled flumazenil was used to estimate the main binding parameters, BP and B'(max). For SPECT studies, a single injection protocol of [(123)I]iomazenil was used to estimate BP values. The BP values were estimated using one- and two-tissue compartment models for the target region. Similar BP values were obtained using either the one- or two-tissue compartment model. This is probably due to the rapid equilibrium between tissue compartments reached with these radioligands. For PET and SPECT, these BP values were highly correlated (r > 0.960) to the BP values obtained using the arterial input function. We also found high correlations between the BP values obtained using the simplified reference tissue method and the receptor density parameter B'(max) (r > 0.884). However, the reference tissue methods yielded lower BP values than those obtained using the conventional approach. Moreover, there was a bias on BP values that was not a simple scaling. It seems that the physiological values found in gray matter structures using these radioligands give acceptable BP values. We conclude that the reference tissue methods should be carefully evaluated for each radioligand.", 
    "137": "We investigated the characteristics of the flurothyl-induced seizures and the effects of antiepileptic drugs on the flurothyl-induced seizure model in a previously untested Mongolian gerbil species. Mongolian gerbils demonstrated tonic extension immediately after or within 1 min after the appearance of clonic convulsion. Very high amplitude spike waves appeared in these regions concurrent with the appearance of clonic convulsion. When the tonic extension appeared immediately after the clonic convulsion, the high amplitude spike waves continued during tonic convulsion. When the tonic extension occurred, high amplitude spike waves appeared in these three regions within a very short time, and afterward Mongolian gerbils died. Administration of valproic acid-Na (200 mg/kg), ethosuximide (100 and 200 mg/kg), clonazepam (2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the latency of clonic convulsion. Zonisamide-Na, phenytoin and carbamazepine, however, had no such effect. In Mongolian gerbils, tonic extension was demonstrated immediately after the appearance of clonic convulsion, yet, this effect was inhibited by all these drugs in a dose-dependent manner. Diazepam completely blocked the appearance of any behavioral changes in animals. These findings suggest that diazepam has a significant effect on flurothyl-induced seizures. Flurothyl-induced convulsions are associated with GABA receptors; hence, benzodiazepine (BDP) suppression may result from the strong relation between BDP and GABAnergic neurons.",

It is generally agreed that these agents reduce the myocardial damage caused by ischemia and reperfusion. Other anesthetics which are often used in clinical practice, such as fentanyl, ketamine, barbiturates and benzodiazepines have been much less studied, and their potential as cardioprotectors is currently unknown. There are some proposed mechanisms for protection by anesthetic agents: ischemic preconditioning-like effect, interference in the neutrophil/platelet-endothelium interaction, blockade of Ca2+ overload to the cytosolic space and antioxidant-like effect. Different anesthetics appear to have different mechanisms by which protection is exerted. Clinical applicability of anesthetic agent-induced protection has yet to be explored.", 
    "146": "There is increasing evidence of anesthetic agent-induced protection. At present, isoflurane, sevoflurane and morphine appear to be most promising as preconditioning-inducing agents.

    "151": "Diabetic neuropathy is a most-convoluted complication. Diabetic gastropathy, ulcers, diarrhea, and bladder dysfunction are the major peripheral neuropathies. Peripheral neuropathies have been the primary neuroscience focus of diabetes research. In contrast to the periphery, the brain is not usually thought to be a target of chronic diabetic complications. However, the impact of diabetes mellitus on the central nervous system has recently gained attention. It is well known that diabetes or hyperglycemia influences the sensitivity of laboratory animals to various pharmacological agents. An increased sensitivity of hyperglycemic or diabetic animals to barbiturates and a decreased sensitivity of D-amphetamine, p-chloroamphetamine, and carbon tetrachloride have been demonstrated. Furthermore, it was reported that mice and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and spontaneously diabetic mice are significantly less sensitive than non-diabetic mice to the antinociceptive effect of morphine. However, little information is available regarding the mechanism responsible for these changes. It is well established that anxiety and depression are common in patients with diabetes. Moreover, diabetic animals showed significantly more anxiogenic activity than non-diabetic animals did. However, the mechanisms through which diabetes may contribute to the development of, or be a risk factor for, psychiatric disorders are not clear. We provide an overview of our current understanding of the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the opioid receptor and the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "152": "Noise represents an environmental stress factor affecting several organs and apparati, including the cardiovascular system. In experimental animals undergoing noise exposure, subcellular myocardial changes have been reported, especially at mitochondrial level; in particular, after 6 hours of exposure only the atrium exhibited significant mitochondrial alterations, whereas after 12 hours as well as subchronic exposure both atrium and ventricle were damaged. The first part of the present article overviews the experimental evidence on effects of noise on the myocardium. In the second part, the review analyzes the role of benzodiazepine receptors and the potential efficacy of benzodiazepine ligands in preventing the mitochondrial damage induced by noise exposure. Drugs acting at both central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors significantly prevent this damage. Differences in the amount and the duration of the protective effect might depend on variability in the potency and pharmacokinetics of the specific drug. The effects of the combined treatment with selective and non-selective peripheral benzodiazepine ligands on noise stimulation are discussed at biochemical level reviewing studies on the effects of noise exposure on mitochondrial fractions.",

The increases produced when shock alone was delivered were eliminated when rats did not have a history of food plus shock pairings. In addition to increasing suppressed responding, CDAP also prevented the suppression in both punished and non-punished response rates that resulted from adding a food plus shock or shock alone contingency.",

    "164": "Initially, it was found that two non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonists released punished responding in pigeons with a magnitude comparable to that of benzodiazepine anxiolytics. This result was one of the key evidences that led to the concept that 5-HT enhanced anxiety by acting both in the forebrain and in the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). Further evidence supported this hypothesis regarding the forebrain, but results with electrical stimulation and intracerebral drug injection into the PAG indicated that 5-HT inhibited aversive behavior evoked from this area. As a result, it has been suggested that 5-HT has a dual role in the regulation of defense, namely enhancing learned responses to potential or distal threat through actions in the forebrain while inhibiting unconditioned responses to proximal threat by acting on the PAG. The former would be related to generalized anxiety and the latter to panic disorder. To test this hypothesis, a new animal model, named the elevated T-maze, has been designed. It consists of one arm enclosed by walls that is perpendicular to two open arms elevated from the floor. The same rat performs two tasks, namely inhibitory avoidance of the elevated open arms, representing conditioned anxiety and one-way escape from one of the open arms, representative of unconditioned fear.",

It is the goal of this review to examine novel pharmacological and molecular tools that target the neural mechanisms for different kinds of aggressive behavior more selectively than previously possible and to outline potential pharmacotherapeutic options.", 
    "168": "(1) The preclinical focus on the behavioral characteristics and determinants of intense aggression promises to be most relevant to the clinical distinction between the proposed impulsive-reactive-hostile-affective subtypes of human aggression and the controlled-proactive-instrumental-predatory subtypes of aggression. The neural circuits for many types of human and animal aggression critically involve serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and specific receptor subtypes. (2) The dynamic changes in frontal cortical serotonin that are triggered by engaging in aggressive behavior imply that serotonergic drug effects are largely determined by the functional state of the receptors at the time of drug treatment. Of the numerous 5-HT receptors currently identified, the 5-HT(1B) receptors offer a promising target for reducing impulsive aggressive behavior, particularly if the action can be limited to sites in the central nervous system. (3) Aggressive confrontations are salient stressors, both for the aggressor as well as the victim of aggression, that are accompanied by activation of the mesocorticolimbic but not the striatal dopamine system. Dopaminergic manipulations, particularly targeting the D(2) receptor family, can influence aggressive behavior in animals and human patients, suggesting that mesocorticolimbic dopamine may have important enabling or permissive functions. (4) GABA is critical in the neurochemical control of aggressive behavior as evidenced by studies that directly modify GABAergic neurotransmission and neurochemical studies that correlate GABA measurements with aggressive behavioral responses in several animal species. The GABA(A) receptor complex is a mechanism through which certain benzodiazepines and alcohol enhance and inhibit aggressive behaviors. Social and pharmacological experiences decisively determine the effects of GABAergic positive modulators on aggression.",

All tested compounds protected animals from brain damage induced by AMPA as assessed 5 days later by using a tissue volume determination method based on computer-aided serial section reconstruction. GYKI 53784 (56.1 +/- 5.0% protection) and talampanel (42.5 +/- 5.3% protection) were more potent neuroprotective agents than GYKI 52466 (21.8 +/- 2.8% protection). Furthermore, the three compounds attenuated the unilateral AMPA injection-induced turning behavior and seizure-like events.Our present findings are in agreement with those of other investigators who found talampanel neuroprotective in various in vivo experimental models.

The following polymorphisms were studied: serotonin receptor 5-HT2A (102-T/C, His452Tyr), serotonin receptor 5-HT2C (Cys23Ser, -330-GGT/-244-CT), and serotonin transporter (VNTR, 5-HTTLPR).", 
    "175": "Global clinical improvement, measured with both the GAS and PANSS total scores, was observed. When patients were divided into responders and non-responders, the distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies was similar to the one observed in previous studies with clozapine. When regression analyses were undertaken, polymorphism 330-GT/-244-CT of the 5-HT2C serotonin receptor and 5-HTTLPR of the serotonin transporter showed a tendency towards the association to olanzapine response.", 
    "176": "The present study provides preliminary evidence of the important role of variations in serotonin transmission related genes in determining clinical response to olanzapine. Considering previous studies, it can also be concluded that olanzapine and clozapine may have similar affinities to serotonin receptors.", 
    "177": "To identify the factors that affect the prescription of benzodiazepines and similar drugs and the actions that can be taken to reduce their prescription.Design. Consensus method. Delphi technique.", 
    "178": "Four primary care areas in Asturias. Participants. 39 doctors from primary care teams agreed voluntarily to take part in the study, and 32 completed the study. They belonged to 20 health centres.", 
    "179": "They were sent by mail three questionnaires one after the other. The second and third questionnaires were worked out on the basis of the analysis of the information from the replies to the preceding questionnaire. Those who did not send in a reply were reminded by phone.", 
    "180": "The 5 most influential factors in benzodiazepine prescription were agreed: reduction in the threshold of tolerance of emotional discomfort; increase of the prevalence of pathologies; lack of time in the consulting-room; social and economic conditioning factors; properties of the benzodiazepine family. The 5 most important actions that could reduce prescription of these drugs were agreed: general health education; reduction in case loads; making doctors more conscious of prescribing correctly; strengthening the social support network; doctors fomenting use of effective alternative treatments.", 
    "181": "The prescription of benzodiazepines and their analogues is a multi-factorial action with social and psychological roots. The action most voted on to reduce their prescription was general health education."
