    "0": "Neurotoxic effects of compounds can be tested in vitro using cell systems. One example is aggregating rat brain cell cultures. For the extrapolation of in vitro data to the in vivo situation, it is important to take the biokinetics of the test compound into account. In addition, the exposure in vivo is often for a longer period of time; therefore, it is crucial to incorporate this into in vitro assays as well. In this study, aggregating rat brain cell cultures were exposed to chlorpromazine (CPZ) and diazepam (DZP) for 12-days with repeated exposure. Samples were taken from the stocks, test media, cell culture media and cells at specific time points on the first and last exposure day. These samples were analysed by HPLC-UV. The amount of CPZ in the medium decreased over time, whereas the amount in the cells showed an increase. Accumulation of CPZ in the cells was seen over the 12-day repeated exposure. The amount of DZP in the medium remained stable over time and only up to 2% of DZP added was found in the cells. Different biokinetic behaviour was found for CPZ and DZP. Possible explanations are differences in uptake into the cells or efflux out of the cells. The decrease of CPZ in the medium versus the stable amount of DZP results in differences in exposure concentrations over time, which should be taken into account when interpreting in vitro effect data.", 
    "1": "Vocalizations of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were examined under experimental situations related to fear or anxiety. When marmosets were isolated in an unfamiliar environment, they frequently vocalized \"tsik-egg\" calls, which were the combination calls of 'tsik' followed by several 'egg'. Tsik-egg calls were also observed after treatment with the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 (20mg/kg, sc). In contrast, when marmosets were exposed to predatory stimuli as fear-evoking situations, they frequently vocalized tsik solo calls as well as tsik-egg calls. These results suggest that marmosets dissociate the vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik calls under conditions related to fear/anxiety; tsik-egg solo vocalizations were emitted under anxiety-related conditions (e.g., isolation and anxiogenic drug treatment), whereas a mixed vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik was emitted when confronted with fear-provoking stimuli (i.e., threatening predatory stimuli). Tsik-egg call with/without tsik can be used as a specific vocal index of fear/anxiety in marmosets, which allows us to understand the neural mechanism of negative emotions in primate.", 
    "2": "Non-selective benzodiazepines are a class of sedative and anxiolytic medication that are commonly prescribed. Physiology studies and animal studies suggest that non-selective benzodiazepines may adversely impact respiration through a variety of mechanisms. Several recent, well-designed, population-based observational studies confirm that benzodiazepine-related negative respiratory outcomes are a concern. In this article, the mechanisms and clinical evidence for non-selective benzodiazepine-related adverse respiratory outcomes, as well as the methodological issues relating to the evaluation of adverse drug effects are reviewed.", 
    "3": "In this study, by measuring bispectral index (BIS), we tested the hypothesis that intravenous adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) infusion would deepen the level of midazolam-induced sedation. Ten healthy volunteers underwent 2 experiments with at least 2 weeks' interval: immediately after intravenous bolus administration of midazolam (0.04 mg/kg), they received continuous infusion of either ATP infusion (100 \u03bcg/kg/min) or placebo (saline) for 40 minutes in a double-blind, randomized, crossover manner. Changes in BIS values and responsiveness to verbal command as well as cardiorespiratory variables were observed throughout the study periods. Administration of midazolam alone reduced BIS value from control: 97 \u00b1 1 to 68 \u00b1 18 at 25 minutes, which was accompanied by significant cardiopulmonary depressant effects, while maintaining responsiveness to verbal command (consciousness) throughout the study period. Coadministration of ATP with midazolam further reduced BIS value to 51 \u00b1 13, associated with complete loss of consciousness without adverse effect on the cardiorespiratory systems. We conclude that the addition of ATP infusion to midazolam significantly enhances midazolam sedation without disturbing cardiorespiratory functions.",

Of the 678 patients receiving antipsychotic monotherapy, 6.9% (n=47) were prescribed a typical antipsychotic and 93.1% (n=631) were prescribed an atypical antipsychotic. Of the 173 patients receiving a combination of antipsychotic drugs, only 6.4% (n=11) had been prescribed polypharmacy with typical antipsychotics, while 46.82% (n=81) were prescribed atypical+atypical antipsychotics or typical+atypical antipsychotics. The highest co-prescription rates for other psychotropic drugs in conjunction with antipsychotics included benzodiazepines (30.3%), anticholinergic drugs (28.8%), antidepressants (13.3%), \u03b2-blockers (10.1%), and mood stabilizers (8.7%).", 
    "11": "The present findings demonstrate that the rate of antipsychotic polypharmacy is relatively low in Korea and that Korean clinicians prefer to prescribe atypical, rather than typical, antipsychotic drugs.

It is characterised by focal seizures associated with motor signs and somatosensory symptoms, at times progressing to become generalised.

One study, a placebo-controlled trial with a low risk of bias, found that individuals on sulthiame were significantly more likely to remain in seizure remission during the three and six months from commencement of treatment than those on placebo (3 months: RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.44; 6 months: RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.86, 66 participants, moderate quality evidence). The other three trials, all open-labelled studies, had a high risk of bias and did not show any significant differences in terms of seizure remission between AEDs. One compared levetiracetam with oxcarbazepine (3 months: RR 1.13, 95% CI of 0.93 - 1.36; 12 months: RR of 1.29 with 95% CI of 0.89 - 1.86, 39 participants, low to very low quality evidence), one clobazam with carbamazepine (4-40 weeks: RR of 1.04, 95% CI of 0.67 - 1.62; last 9 months: RR of 1.06 with 95% CI of 0.84, 1.34, 45 participants, low quality evidence), and one carbamazepine with topiramate (28 weeks: RR 1.02 with 95% CI of 0.8 - 1.3, 112 participants, low quality evidence).Other outcome measures assessed included time to first seizure after randomisation which was only obtained in the sulthiame versus placebo study as a hazard ratio of 7.8 (95% CI 2.66 - 22.87). There were no significant differences between the proportion of participants who had adverse events, apart from a higher incidence of rash in the carbamazepine group (14.8%) when compared with topiramate (1.7%), or the proportion who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events, when this was reported. Two trials (carbamazepine versus topiramate, and clobazam versus carbamazepine) evaluated the effects on cognition. The studies were of low to very low quality evidence showing no clear difference in cognition at the end of the study periods between the AEDs compared. A meta-analysis was not performed as the RCTs evaluated different therapies.", 
    "18": "There is evidence from one trial reviewed that sulthiame is effective for seizure remission in the short term in children with BECTS although the precision of the effect estimate is uncertain due to its small sample size. There were no significant differences in the proportion of adverse events between treatment groups studied, including those resulting in withdrawal of treatment. There is insufficient evidence about the medium to longer term effects on seizure control, the optimum antiepileptic drug treatment and the effects of AED treatment on cognition. There is a need for more good quality randomised controlled trials to address these questions to aid the management of children with BECTS.", 
    "19": "In the United States, opioid analgesics have increasingly been prescribed in the treatment of chronic pain, and this trend has accompanied increasing rates of misuse and overdose. Lawmakers have responded with myriad policies to curb the growing epidemic of opioid misuse, and a global alarm has been sounded among countries wishing to avoid this path. In the United Kingdom, a similar trend of increasing opioid consumption, albeit at lower levels, has been observed without an increase in reported misuse or drug-related deaths. The comparison between these two countries in opioid prescribing and opioid overdose mortality underscores important features of prescribing, culture, and health systems that may be permissive or protective in the development of a public health crisis. As access to opioid medications increases around the world, it becomes vitally important to understand the forces impacting opioid use and misuse. Trends in benzodiazepine and methadone use in the UK as well as structural elements of the National Health Service may serve to buffer opioid-related harms in the face of increasing prescriptions. In addition, the availability and price of heroin, as well as the ease of access to opioid agonist treatment in the UK may limit the growth of the illicit market for prescription opioids. The comparison between the US and the UK in opioid consumption and overdose rates should serve as a call to action for UK physicians and policymakers. Basic, proactive steps in the form of surveillance - of overdoses, marketing practices, prescribers, and patients - and education programs may help avert a public health crisis as opioid prescriptions increase.",

Data on the subclinical prevalence of these diseases are scarce due to the fact that an immunological and imaging diagnosis is not often available in endemic areas. We conducted a cross-sectional study on HIV1(+) patients from Beira city in order to determine the seroprevalence of cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis and echinoccocosis and its possible interaction with HIV infection.", 
    "21": "Patients (601) were voluntarily recruited at the Ponta Gea Health Center and their demographic and clinical data were recorded (including CD4(+) cell count and antiretroviral regimen). Mean age was 39.7 years, 378 (62.9%) were women and 223 (37.1%) were men. Four hundred seventy-five (475) patients (79%) were already on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and 90 started therapy after being enrolled in the study. For serological testing we used a Multiplex Western Blot IgG from LDBIO Diagnostics. The overall seroprevalence was 10.2% for cysticercosis, 23% for schistosomiasis, 7.3% for toxocariasis and 17.3% for echinococcosis.", 
    "22": "Neither age nor the CD4(+) count were significantly associated with the seroprevalence of the helminths studied.

Female gender was significantly associated with cysticercosis and schistosomiasis, and being in HAART with toxocariasis. Headache was significantly associated with cysticercosis and toxocariasis. There was no association between epilepsy and seropositivity to any of the parasites. The study concluded that a clear understanding of the prevalence and manifestations of these coinfections, how best to diagnose subclinical cases, and how to manage diseases with concomitant antiretroviral therapy is needed.", 
    "23": "The prevalence of benzodiazepine consumption in Japan is one of the highest worldwide. Etizolam is the most abused drug of the benzodiazepine class. The treatment of benzodiazepine dependence is difficult. We report a case of successful dosage reduction in a 24-year-old female patient with etizolam dependence. She was diagnosed with etizolam dependence at the age of 22 years old. We proposed a benzodiazepine dependence treatment that involved replacing etizolam with a long-acting benzodiazepine class drug in conjunction with a long-term weaning plan. However, the patient refused the treatment and insisted that reducing the number of tablets would increase her anxiety. After providing a detailed explanation and receiving consent from the patient, a treatment regimen consisting of fine granules of etizolam mixed with lactose granules was begun with the aim of reducing the percentage of etizolam at a rate of 0.3 mg/week. The treatment of etizolam dependence in this patient was successful. This treatment strategy may be an effective option for patients who are difficult to treat with conventional methods, or who have anxiety regarding the reduction of the amount of the drug itself.", 
    "24": "Zolpidem is a short-acting non-benzodiazepine hypnotic that is used to improve sleep architecture in patients with burn injuries. This study evaluated the relationship between zolpidem administration and sleep parameters in a cohort of children with severe burn injuries. Standard age-based zolpidem dosing practices were employed. Polysomnography data were recorded at 30-second intervals throughout the night. Serum concentrations of zolpidem were measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours after administration of the first dose. The relationship between zolpidem concentrations and sleep parameters was evaluated using Markov mixed-effects pharmacodynamic models. Ten children received two doses of zolpidem at 22:00 and 02:00 hours. The median total amount of sleep was 361.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 299.0-418.5) minutes; approximately 65% of the normal reference value for an 8-hour period. Slow-wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were also dramatically reduced (18-37% of normal). With two doses of zolpidem, stage 2 sleep was 99% of normal levels. Higher peak zolpidem concentrations were associated with increased stage 2 sleep (r = .54; P = .04). Despite this, a median of 120.0 (IQR: 99.5-143.5) transitions between nocturnal sleep stages were recorded, with a median of 55.5 (IQR: 36-75) night-time awakenings per patient. In pediatric burn patients, higher zolpidem serum concentrations were associated with restoration of stage 2 sleep to normal levels. Nonetheless, slow-wave and REM sleep were profoundly depressed with frequent transitions between sleep stages, suggesting that alternative hypnotic agents may be required to restore normal sleep architecture in severely burned children.",

The scope of this paper is to analyze differences in alcohol and drug consumption, as well as on behavior associated with traffic accidents among men and women. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 609 sequential traffic accident victims attended in emergency care from Porto Alegre. Subjects gave a structured interview, were breathalyzed and had a saliva test for alcohol/drug screening. Results showed that women were mainly passengers or pedestrians (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in positive blood alcohol concentration. However, men reported more binge drinking and THC use, while women had more benzodiazepine in their saliva (p<0.05). This is the first Brazilian study to compare alcohol and drug use among men and women who were the victims of traffic accidents. Results point to differences in the pattern of substance abuse, as well on risk behavior. Data may be useful for specific prevention strategies that take gender differences into consideration.",

Behavioral parameters showed significantly higher proportions of \"pacing\" post-treatment in all groups receiving midazolam, and \"restlessness,\" \"chewing/licking,\" and \"sniffing\" in M. No significant differences were found for TAC at baseline and post-treatment.

In this review we present important clinical and therapeutic aspects of substance abuse and addiction in the elderly and focus on alcohol, benzodiazepines and opioids. Daily and risky alcohol consumption is common among older people. They also have an increased risk getting alcohol-related complications. For early detection, laboratory parameters and questionnaires such as the AUDIT-C are suitable. Therapeutically brief interventions have been proved successful. Also, abuse of benzodiazepines, especially low-dose addiction, is widespread among older persons, although often overlooked, and patients often do not recognize their addiction. The physician has to know the correct indication, adequate dosage and pharmacological interactions. A slow-dose reduction is recommended in case of addiction. Thanks to opioid substitution therapy, patients with an opioidaddiction can reach a higher age. Age influences the effects of the substitute, which may require an adjustment of the dosage. Treatment of elderly patients should be based on their needs and resources and is usually very effective.",

Two cases of ADRs (1.1 %) had a 'certain' causality score (I4) and 13 (7.5 %) a 'likely' score (I3). The suspected drugs include antiepileptic drugs, opiate analgesics and benzodiazepines. These results also demonstrate that some drugs that were thought to be anodyne or for which no data were available, such as ketoprofen and hydroxyzine, may be implicated in adverse effects. Finally, these data show that certain drugs, like pseudoephedrine, which should not be used during breastfeeding, were nevertheless implicated in several of the adverse drug reactions recorded.", 
    "34": "This study shows that ADR via breastfeeding are rarely reported due to low awareness or low occurrence of ADR via breast milk. These results highlight the need for additional pharmacokinetic, clinical and epidemiological studies, given the paucity of published data. They also demonstrate the need to improve information for the general public about drugs and self-medication during breastfeeding.", 
    "35": "The relationship between benzodiazepine consumption and subsequent increases in aggressive behaviour in humans is not well understood.", 
    "36": "The current study aimed to identify, via a systematic review, whether there is an association between benzodiazepine consumption and aggressive responding in adults.", 
    "37": "A systematic review was conducted and reported in line with the PRISMA statement. English articles within MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, and Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection databases were searched. Additional studies were identified by searching reference lists of reviewed articles. Only articles that explicitly investigated the relationship between benzodiazepine consumption and subsequent aggressive behaviour, or a lack thereof, in human adults were included.", 
    "38": "Forty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of study design and benzodiazepine type and dose. An association between benzodiazepine use and subsequent aggressive behaviour was found in the majority of the more rigorous studies, although there is a paucity of high-quality research with clinical or forensic populations. Diazepam and alprazolam have received the most attention. Dose-related findings are inconsistent: therapeutic doses may be more likely to be associated with aggressive responding when administered as a once-off, whereas higher doses may be more risky following repeated administration. Trait levels of anxiety and hostility may indicate a vulnerability to the experience of benzodiazepine-related aggression.", 
    "39": "There appears to be a moderate association between some benzodiazepines and subsequent aggressive behaviour in humans. The circumstances under which aggressive responding may be more likely to follow benzodiazepine use remain unclear, although some evidence suggests dose and/or personality factors may influence this effect.", 
    "40": "Terpinen-4-ol (4TRP) is a monoterpenoid alcoholic component of essential oils obtained from several aromatic plants. We investigated the psychopharmacological and electrophysiological activities of 4TRP in male Swiss mice and Wistar rats. 4TRP was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at doses of 25 to 200\u2009mg/kg and intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at concentrations of 10, 20, and 40\u2009ng/2\u2009\u03bcL. For in vitro experiments, 4TRP concentrations were 0.1\u2009mM and 1.0\u2009mM. 4TRP (i.p.) inhibited pentylenetetrazol- (PTZ-) induced seizures, indicating anticonvulsant effects. Electroencephalographic recordings showed that 4TRP (i.c.v.) protected against PTZ-induced seizures, corroborating the behavioural results. To determine whether 4TRP exerts anticonvulsant effects via regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission, we measured convulsions induced by 3-mercapto-propionic acid (3-MP). The obtained results showed involvement of the GABAergic system in the anticonvulsant action exerted by 4TRP, but flumazenil, a selective antagonist of the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor, did not reverse the anticonvulsant effect, demonstrating that 4TRP does not bind to the benzodiazepine-binding site. Furthermore, 4TRP decreased the sodium current through voltage-dependent sodium channels, and thus its anticonvulsant effect may be related to changes in neuronal excitability because of modulation of these channels.",

    "42": "A cost analysis using a Markov model considering the following health states was performed: no existence of adverse events (NAE); extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS); weight gain (WG); and sexual dysfunction (SD). Transition probabilities amongst health states were estimated from meta-analyses of clinical trials and from a retrospective Spanish study. The healthcare costs associated to each health state were obtained from a published Spanish study. The minimum acquisition cost per mg of the mean daily dose for each AOA was used. This is considered to be a relevant efficiency criterion in Hospital Pharmacy Departments. The time horizon applied in the analysis was 12 months. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed for all the variables involved in the analysis with Monte Carlo simulations. All costs were updated to 2013 costs using the Spanish Health System price index.", 
    "43": "In comparison with OLA, treatment with ARI generates annual average cost savings per patient of \u00a4289 (CI95% \u00a4271; \u00a4308). In the hypothetical scenario in which we assume that ARI may have a similar rate of sexual dysfunction as that of quetiapine (i.e. the lowest rate amongst AOAs), the additional cost per patient would be \u00a4323 (CI95% \u00a4330; \u00a4317).", 
    "44": "The results of this analysis show that patients treated with aripiprazole demonstrate lower adverse events costs in comparison to olanzapine. This difference may generate significant cost savings in the Spanish health system in the treatment of patients affected by bipolar disorders. The robustness of the results was tested via a probabilistic analysis.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the interactions between clonidine and ketamine in hemodynamic and the psychological effects. Psychological effects were evaluated in a very detailed way.", 
    "46": "A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed for 48 patients with major burns, aged 18-60 years, ASA II or III, who were scheduled for dressing changes was conducted. Midazolam, S+ ketamine, placebo, or clonidine was used for the anesthesia. Intraoperative hemodynamic alterations over time were assessed. The psychological effects were evaluated in detail using 13 variables, the return of conscience, and analgesia during the first 2h after the procedures.", 
    "47": "The clonidine group had low arterial pressure during the procedure. At the 30-min evaluation of the psychological variables, five out of 13 were lower in the clonidine group. At the 2-h evaluation, only the Anxious variable was lower in the clonidine group. Cardiac frequency, postoperative analgesia, delirium, and dreaming were not different between both groups. There was no difference in complication rates between both groups.",

    "49": "Delirium and dementia as organically caused mental disorders exhibit similarities in the clinical and neurological sense and often occur together. The existence of one appears to increase the risk for the development of the other. Although delirium is a very common disorder especially among the elderly, it is often not recognized. For the diagnosis of delirium, an exact family and case history including medication, clinical examination and determination of routine laboratory values are not infrequently necessary. Causal treatment of delirium is possible and not necessarily complicated. Both non-medicative and medicative measures are available for the symptomatic treatment. The non-medicative measures are to a large extent applied by nursing staff and comprise, among others, orientation guidance and attaining a balance between perceptual overload and deprivation. A good knowledge of symptomatology is decisive, also from the prevention point of view (nurses specialized in delirium). For symptomatic medicative treatment neuroleptic agents appear to be favorable. With regard to extrapyramidal side effects atypical neuroleptics are better than the typical ones. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors is not robustly supported by the literature. The use of benzodiazepines is rather discouraged except for the treatment of withdrawal delirium. Preparations with short half-lives and absence of active metabolites can be used as accompanying measures for a short time. Prevention appears to be extremely important for which the treating personnel require a good knowledge of risk factors and their management. The occurrence of delirium among cases of alpha-synucleinopathies represents a special case. Both international and German guidelines on the management of delirium are available.", 
    "50": "We compared three methods for identifying drug overdose cases in inpatient hospital discharge data on their ability to classify drug overdoses by intent and drug type(s) involved.", 
    "51": "We compared three International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code-based case definitions using Kentucky hospital discharge data for 2000-2011. The first definition (Definition 1) was based on the external-cause-of-injury (E-code) matrix. The other two definitions were based on the Injury Surveillance Workgroup on Poisoning (ISW7) consensus recommendations for national and state poisoning surveillance using the principal diagnosis or first E-code (Definition 2) or any diagnosis/E-code (Definition 3).", 
    "52": "Definition 3 identified almost 50% more drug overdose cases than did Definition 1. The increase was largely due to cases with a first-listed E-code describing a drug overdose but a principal diagnosis that was different from drug overdose (e.g., mental disorders, or respiratory or circulatory system failure). Regardless of the definition, more than 53% of the hospitalizations were self-inflicted drug overdoses; benzodiazepines were involved in about 30% of the hospitalizations. The 2011 age-adjusted drug overdose hospitalization rate in Kentucky was 146/100,000 population using Definition 3 and 107/100,000 population using Definition 1.", 
    "53": "The ISW7 drug overdose definition using any drug poisoning diagnosis/E-code (Definition 3) is potentially the highest sensitivity definition for counting drug overdose hospitalizations, including by intent and drug type(s) involved. As the states enact policies and plan for adequate treatment resources, standardized drug overdose definitions are critical for accurate reporting, trend analysis, policy evaluation, and state-to-state comparison.", 
    "54": "Sedation with propofol should be administered by personnel trained in advanced airway management. To overcome this limitation, the use of short acting benzodiazepines by cardiologists spread widely, causing concerns about the safety of this procedure in the absence of anesthesiology assistance. The aim of the study was to compare feasibility of a cardiologist-only approach with an anesthesiologist-assisted sedation protocol during elective direct-current cardioversion (DCC) of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).", 
    "55": "This prospective, open-blinded, randomized study included 204 patients, which were admitted for scheduled cardioversion of persistent AF, and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either propofol or midazolam treatment arm. Patients in the propofol group underwent DCC with anesthesiologist assistance, while patients in the midazolam group saw the cardiologist as the only responsible for both sedation and DCC.", 
    "56": "Twenty-three adverse events occurred: 13 in the propofol group and 10 in the midazolam group (p=NS). Most of them were related to bradyarrhythmias and respiratory depressions. There was no need of intubation or other advanced resuscitation techniques in any of these patients. No differences were found regarding procedure tolerability and safety endpoints between the two groups. DCC procedures with anesthesiology support were burdened by higher delay from scheduled time and higher costs.", 
    "57": "Sedation with midazolam administered by cardiologist-only appears to be as safe as sedation with propofol and anesthesiologist assistance. Adverse events were few in both groups and easily handled by the cardiologist alone. A cardiologist-only approach to sedation provides less procedural delay, thus being easier to schedule and correlated with fewer costs.", 
    "58": "Maerua angolensis DC is traditionally used for the treatment of epilepsy and insomnia. The present study was designed to investigate the anxiolytic, sedative and toxicological effect of hydromethanolic stem bark extract of M. angolensis using animal model. Sub-chronic doses of the plant extract on liver and kidney function test were investigated. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and diazepam-induced sleeping time test was used in this investigation. The possible involvement of M. angolensis with GABAA receptor was also investigated using flumazenil. The results of acute toxicity studies showed LD50 to be greater than 5000mg/kg body weight. The test extract (40 and 80mg/kg) significantly (p<0.05) increased the number of open arm entries and time spent in the open arm entries. However, flumazenil with 80mg/kg plant extract showed no significant (p >0.01) difference in the number of entries into open arm when compared to control. The stem bark extract of M. angolensis significantly (p<0.01) increased the duration of sleep induced by diazepam in a dose-dependent manner. However, flumazenil with 80mg/kg extract showed no significant (p>0.01) sedative effect when compared to normal control. In conclusion, the result of our present findings revealed that M. angolensis may apparently be safe and non toxic at therapeutic dose. However, the plant may possess anxiolytic and sedative properties, which exert their effect on GABAA receptors.",

A comparative study of the anxiolytic effect and tolerability of selank and phenazepam was carried out in 60 patients with phobic-anxiety- and somatoform disorders (F40.2-9, F41.1-9, F45.0-1 by ICD-10) were examined. Results Pronounced anxiolytic and mild nootropic effects of selank were demonstrated. The anxiolytic effect lasted for a week after last receiving the peptide.

The results showed that the nanocomposite modified by polyaniline with p-toluene sulfonic acid as a dopant demonstrated higher extraction efficiency for lorazepam (LRZ) and nitrazepam (NRZ). Also the synthesized magnetic sorbents were characterized. The nanocomposite sorbent in combination with high performance liquid chromatography-UV detection was applied for the extraction, preconcentration and determination of lorazepam and nitrazepam in urine and plasma samples. Different parameters influencing the extraction efficiency including: sample pH, amount of sorbent, sorption time, elution solvent and its volume, salt content, and elution time were optimized. The obtained optimal conditions were: sample pH, 6; amount of sorbent, 5 mg; sorption time, 5.0 min; elution solvent and its volume, 0.5 mM cethyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in acetonitrile, 150 \u03bcL; elution time, 2.0 min and without addition of NaCl. The calibration curves were linear in the concentration range of 1-2000 \u03bcg L(-1). The limits of detection (LODs) were achieved in the range of 0.5-1.8 \u03bcg L(-1) for NRZ and 0.2-2.0 \u03bcg L(-1) for LRZ, respectively. The percent of extraction recoveries and relative standard deviations (n=5) were in the range of 84.0-99.0, 6.1-7.8 for NRZ and 90.0-99.0, 4.1-7.0 for LRZ, respectively. Ultimately, the applicability of the method was successfully confirmed by the extraction and determination of NRZ and LRZ in human urine and plasma samples.", 
    "61": "Organophosphate (OP) compounds, including paraoxon (POX), are similar to nerve agents such as sarin. There is a growing concern that OP agents could be weaponized to cause mass civilian causalities. We have developed a rodent survival model of POX toxicity that is being used to evaluate chronic morbidity and to screen for medical countermeasures against severe OP exposure. It is well known that the survivors of nerve gas and chronic OP exposure exhibit neurobehavioral deficits such as mood changes, depression, and memory impairments. In this study we investigated whether animals surviving severe POX exposure exhibited long-term neurological impairments. POX exposure produced overt signs of cholinergic toxicity. Rats were rescued using an optimized atropine, 2-PAM and diazepam therapy. Surviving rats were studied using established behavioral assays for identifying symptoms of depression and memory impairment 3-months after POX exposure. In the forced swim test, POX rats exhibited increased immobility time indicative of a despair-like state. In the sucrose preference test, POX rats consumed significantly less sucrose water indicating anhedonia-like condition. POX rats also displayed increased anxiety as characterized by significantly lower performance in the open arm of the elevated plus maze. Further, when tested with a novel object recognition paradigm, POX rats exhibited a negative discrimination ratio indicative of impaired recognition memory. The results indicate that this model of survival from severe POX exposure can be employed to study some of the molecular bases for OP-induced chronic behavioral and cognitive comorbidities and develop therapies for their treatment.",

The future of PTSD treatment may specifically target the molecular mechanisms of PTSD. In the US, approximately 20% of adults report taking herbal products to treat medical illnesses. L-theanine is the amino acid in green tea primarily responsible for relaxation effects. No studies have evaluated the potential therapeutic properties of herbal medications on gene expression in PTSD. We evaluated gene expression in PTSD-induced changes in the amygdala and hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were assigned to PTSD-stressed and nonstressed groups that received either saline, midazolam, L-theanine, or L-theanine + midazolam. Amygdala and hippocampus tissue samples were analyzed for changes in gene expression. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant difference between groups in the amygdala and hippocampus. Of 88 genes examined, 17 had a large effect size greater than 0.138. Of these, 3 genes in the hippocampus and 5 genes in the amygdala were considered significant (P < 0.05) between the groups. RT-PCR analysis revealed significant changes between groups in several genes implicated in a variety of disorders ranging from PTSD, anxiety, mood disorders, and substance dependence.", 
    "80": "Benzodiazepines are a large class of commonly-prescribed drugs used to treat a variety of clinical disorders. They have been shown to produce ecological effects at environmental concentrations, making understanding their fate in aquatic environments very important. In this study, uptake and biotransformations by riverine bacterio-plankton of the benzodiazepine, diazepam, and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, ACB (a photo-degradation product of diazepam and several other benzodiazepines), were investigated using batch microcosm incubations. These were conducted using water and bacterio-plankton populations from contrasting river catchments (Tamar and Mersey, UK), both in the presence and absence of a peptide, added as an alternative organic substrate. Incubations lasted 21 days, reflecting the expected water residence time in the catchments. In River Tamar water, 36% of diazepam (p < 0.001) was removed when the peptide was absent. In contrast, there was no removal of diazepam when the peptide was added, although the peptide itself was consumed. For ACB, 61% was removed in the absence of the peptide, and 84% in its presence (p < 0.001 in both cases). In River Mersey water, diazepam removal did not occur in the presence or absence of the peptide, with the latter again consumed, while ACB removal decreased from 44 to 22% with the peptide present. This suggests that bacterio-plankton from the Mersey water degraded the peptide in preference to both diazepam and ACB. Biotransformation products were not detected in any of the samples analysed but a significant increase in ammonium concentration (p < 0.038) was measured in incubations with ACB, confirming mineralization of the amine substituent. Sequential inoculation and incubation of Mersey and Tamar microcosms, for 5 periods of 21 days each, did not produce any evidence of increased ability of the microbial community to remove ACB, suggesting that an indigenous consortium was probably responsible for its metabolism. As ACB degradation was consistent, we propose that the aquatic photo-degradation of diazepam to ACB, followed by mineralization of ACB, is a primary removal pathway for these emerging contaminants. As ACB is photo-produced by several benzodiazepines, this pathway should be relevant for the removal of other benzodiazepines that enter the freshwater environment.",

BZDs were effective in 33 (65%) patients, who were associated with significantly fewer severe adverse events (p = 0.013) and resulted in fewer referrals for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (p = 0.037). Other treatments included ECT (N = 12, 18%); antipsychotic medications, mostly in combination; and treatment of an underlying medical condition, when possible. For 10 patients, four different trials were needed to achieve clinical improvement. When all treatments were combined, there was a better clinical response in acute-onset catatonia (p = 0.032). In contrast, the response was lower in boys (p = 0.044) and when posturing (p = 0.04) and mannerisms (p = 0.008) were present as catatonic symptoms. The treatment response was independent of the underlying psychiatric or systemic medical condition. As in adults, BZDs should be the first-line symptomatic treatment for catatonia in young patients, and ECT should be a second option. Additionally, the absence of an association between the response to treatment and the underlying psychiatric condition suggests that catatonia should be considered as a syndrome.", 
    "94": "Antibiotic therapy disrupts the human intestinal microbiota. In some patients rapid overgrowth of the enteric bacterium Klebsiella oxytoca results in antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC). We isolated and identified a toxin produced by K. oxytoca as the pyrrolobenzodiazepine tilivalline and demonstrated its causative action in the pathogenesis of colitis in an animal model. Tilivalline induced apoptosis in cultured human cells in vitro and disrupted epithelial barrier function, consistent with the mucosal damage associated with colitis observed in human AAHC and the corresponding animal model. Our findings reveal the presence of pyrrolobenzodiazepines in the intestinal microbiota and provide a mechanism for colitis caused by a resident pathobiont. The data link pyrrolobenzodiazepines to human disease and identify tilivalline as a target for diagnosis and neutralizing strategies in prevention and treatment of colitis.", 
    "95": "Exposure to nerve agents induces prolonged status epilepticus (SE), causing brain damage or death. Diazepam (DZP) is the current US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the cessation of nerve agent-induced SE. Here, we compared the efficacy of DZP with that of UBP302 [(S)-3-(2-carboxybenzyl)willardiine; an antagonist of the kainate receptors that contain the GluK1 subunit] against seizures, neuropathology, and behavioral deficits induced by soman in rats. DZP, administered 1 hour or 2 hours postexposure, terminated the SE, but seizures returned; thus, the total duration of SE within 24 hours after soman exposure was similar to (DZP at 1 hour) or longer than (DZP at 2 hours) that in the soman-exposed rats that did not receive the anticonvulsant. Compared with DZP, UBP302 stopped SE with a slower time course, but dramatically reduced the total duration of SE within 24 hours. Neuropathology and behavior were assessed in the groups that received anticonvulsant treatment 1 hour after exposure. UBP302, but not DZP, reduced neuronal degeneration in a number of brain regions, as well as neuronal loss in the basolateral amygdala and the CA1 hippocampal area, and prevented interneuronal loss in the basolateral amygdala. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the open field and by the acoustic startle response 30 days after soman exposure. The results showed that anxiety-like behavior was increased in the DZP-treated group and in the group that did not receive anticonvulsant treatment, but not in the UBP302-treated group. The results argue against the use of DZP for the treatment of nerve agent-induced seizures and brain damage and suggest that targeting GluK1-containing receptors is a more effective approach.",

In unstressed mice, piperine significantly increased brain GABA levels, but could not produce any change in plasma nitrite levels. Meanwhile, in stressed mice, piperine did not produce any significant change in GABA levels, but significantly decreased nitrite levels. Pre-treatment with aminoguanidine (50mg/kg, ip), an inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, significantly potentiated the anxiolytic-like activity of piperine, as compared to piperine and aminoguanidine alone in stressed mice. On the other hand, pretreatment with 7-nitroindazole (20mg/kg, ip), a neuronal NOS inhibitor significantly potentiated the antianxiety-like activity of piperine, as compared to piperine and 7-nitroindazole alone in unstressed mice.",

Chronic co-treatment with betahistine has been found to significantly decrease olanzapine-induced weight gain; however, it is not clear whether this co-treatment affects the therapeutic effects of olanzapine. This study investigated the effects of chronic treatment of olanzapine and/or betahistine on the binding density of the serotonergic 5-HT2A (5-HT2AR) and 5-HT2C (5-HT2CR) receptors, 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), and dopaminergic D\u2082 receptors (D\u2082R) in the brain regions involved in antipsychotic efficacy, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex (Cg), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and caudate putamen (CPu). Rats were treated with olanzapine (1 mg/kg, t.i.d.) or vehicle for 3.5 weeks, and then olanzapine treatment was withdrawn for 19 days. From week 6, the two groups were divided into 4 groups (n=6) for 5 weeks' treatment: (1) olanzapine-only (1 mg/kg, t.i.d.), (2) betahistine-only (9.6 mg/kg, t.i.d.), (3) olanzapine and betahistine co-treatment (O+B), and (4) vehicle. Compared to the control, the olanzapine-only treatment significantly decreased the bindings of 5-HT2AR, 5-HT2CR, and 5-HTT in the PFC, Cg, and NAc. Similar changes were observed in the rats receiving the O+B co-treatment. The olanzapine-only treatment significantly increased the D\u2082R binding in the Cg, NAc, and CPu, while the betahistine-only treatment reduced D\u2082R binding. The co-treatment of betahistine reversed the D\u2082R bindings in the NAc and CPu that were increased by olanzapine. Therefore, chronic O+B co-treatment has similar effects on serotonin transmission as the olanzapine-only treatment, but reverses the D\u2082R that is up-regulated by chronic olanzapine treatment. The co-treatment maintains the therapeutic effects of olanzapine but decreases/prevents the excess weight gain.", 
    "136": "Pregabalin (Lyrica(\u00ae)), a well established anxiolytic agent, has been approved in the EU for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. It has a distinct mechanism of action relative to other anti-anxiety agents (\u03b12\u03b4 binding at presynaptic voltage dependent calcium channels leading to inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission), a rapid onset of effect (typically \u22641\u00a0week) and broad spectrum activity against both the psychic and somatic symptoms of GAD. In long-term studies, pregabalin maintained improvements in anxiety symptoms that occurred in response to short-term treatment and delayed the time to relapse of GAD compared with placebo. Common comorbidities of GAD, such as insomnia, gastrointestinal symptoms and subsyndromal depression, have no effect on the anxiolytic efficacy of, and moreover are specifically improved by, pregabalin. Treatment with pregabalin is generally well tolerated; the drug has an adverse event profile that includes dizziness, somnolence and weight gain. The potential for abuse of pregabalin is low; the risk of withdrawal symptoms is generally low when the drug is discontinued gradually (over 1\u00a0week). Alongside selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), pregabalin is considered a first-line agent for the long-term treatment of GAD by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry. It should be stressed, however, that definitive head-to-head studies comparing pregabalin with SSRI/SNRIs, including in patients with GAD and co-morbid major depressive disorder, are currently lacking. Recently, a study of SSRI/SNRI augmentation with pregabalin yielded positive results, while another study of switching from long-term benzodiazepine therapy to pregabalin was inconclusive; further investigations on these topics are warranted.",

    "140": "Midkine (MK) is a cytokine with important functions in dopaminergic neurons that is found upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of alcoholics. We have studied the behavioural effects of ethanol in MK genetically deficient (MK-/-) and wild type (MK+/+) mice. A low dose of ethanol (1.0g/kg), unable to cause conditioned place preference (CPP) in MK+/+ mice, induced a significant CPP in MK-/- mice, suggesting that MK prevents the rewarding effects of low doses of ethanol. However, this difference between genotypes is lost when a higher, rewarding, dose of ethanol (2.0g/kg) is used. Accordingly, the anxiolytic effects of 1.0mg/kg diazepam, other GABA(A) acting drug, were significantly enhanced in MK-/- mice compared to MK+/+ mice; however, 2.0mg/kg diazepam caused increased anxiolytic effects in MK+/+ mice. In addition, MK-/- mice showed a significant delayed recovery from ethanol (2.0g/kg)-induced ataxia whereas the sedative effects induced by ethanol (3.6g/kg), tested in a loss of righting reflex paradigm, were found to be similar in MK-/- and MK+/+ mice. The data indicate that MK differentially regulates the behavioural responses to ethanol. The results suggest that differences in the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to GABA(A) acting drugs caused by genetic inactivation of MK could underlie the different behavioural responses to ethanol in MK-/- mice. Overall, these results suggest that MK may be a novel genetic factor of importance in alcohol use disorders, and that potentiation of MK signalling pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of these disorders.", 
    "141": "The synchronization of circadian rhythms in sleep, endocrine and metabolic functions with the environmental light cycle is essential for health, and dysfunction of this synchrony is thought to play a part in the development of many neurological disorders. There is a demonstrable need to develop new therapeutics for the treatment of neurological disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, and oxytocin is currently being investigated for this purpose. There are no published reports describing activity of oxytocin receptor ligands on mammalian circadian rhythms and that, then, is the purpose of this study. Non-peptide oxytocin receptor ligands that cross the blood brain barrier were systemically injected in hamsters to determine their ability to modulate light-induced phase advances and delays of circadian wheel running rhythms. The oxytocin receptor agonist WAY267464 (10 mg/kg) inhibited light induced phase advances of wheel running rhythms by 55%, but had no effect on light-induced phase delays. In contrast, the oxytocin receptor antagonist WAY162720 (10 mg/kg) inhibited light-induced phase delays by nearly 75%, but had no effect on light-induced phase advances. Additionally, WAY162720 was able to antagonize the inhibitory effects of WAY267464 on light-induced phase advances. These results are consistent for a role of oxytocin in the phase-delaying effects of light on circadian activity rhythms early in the night. Therefore, oxytocin may prove to be useful in developing therapeutics for the treatment of mood disorders with a concomitant dysfunction in circadian rhythms. Investigators should also be cognizant that oxytocin ligands may negatively affect circadian rhythms during clinical trials for other conditions.",

Furthermore, regarding the conduction of this study, it would be possible to determine whether the trend of drug utilization has increased, decreased or perhaps stabilized. The data on the outpatient utilization of psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics were collected from all Zagreb pharmacies, 2006-2009. Based on the collected data for all N05 and N06 groups of drugs, the defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per thousand inhabitants per day (DDD/TID) have been calculated using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical classification (ATC) for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. To indicate the quality of drug prescription the Drug Utilization 90% (DU 90%) method was used. Moreover, in order to determine a more precise quality of individual drug group prescriptions, the indicators have been calculated by determining the proportion of the total utilization of individual therapeutic and pharmacological therapeutic subgroups in DDD/TID a day. The utilization of anxiolytics (N05B) accounts for most of the psycholeptic utilization in the City of Zagreb throughout the entire study period. In the study period, the utilization of antidepressants has slightly increased, by 10.5%, taking the first and the last years of the period into account. In 2006, 5 benzodiazepines and the hypnotic zolpidem, as well as 5 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 1 third generation antipsychotic (olanzapin) were found in the DU 90% segment. In 2009, the DU 90% segment also comprised 5 benzodiazepines and the hypnotic zolpidem, as well as 6 SSRIs and 1 third generation antipsychotic (olanzapin). In the City of Zagreb, a general insight into the quality of psychopharmaceutical prescriptions indicates stability in comparison to earlier studies. The ratio index of the first generation antipsychotic utilization, compared to the third generation antipsychotics, shows an increase in the quality of prescription. Also, the ratio index of total tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and SSRI utilization indicates improvement in quality of prescription. The ratio index of the entire outpatient utilization of anxiolytics and antidepressants expressed in DDD/TID unfortunately shows a very mild increase of prescription quality. Benzodiazepines accounted for more than 50% of the outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals throughout the study period, which proves the need for precise guidelines as the most significant means of drug rationalization and utilization. It is necessary to identify priorities and problems in order to solve them successfully, by monitoring drug utilization and prescription on a national level. Results demonstrate that within the primary health care system, there is a need for constant education on rational prescription of this drug group.",

Olanzapine-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were prepared through ionotropic gelation of chitosan with tripolyphosphate anions and studied in terms of their size, drug loading, and in vitro release. The OZ nanoparticles were administered i.n. to rabbits, and OZ plasma concentration at predetermined time points was compared to i.n. administration of OZ in solution. The concentrations of OZ in plasma were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS). OZ-loaded chitosan nanoparticles significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced systemic absorption with 51 \u00b1 11.2% absolute bioavailability as compared to 28 \u00b1 6.7% after i.n. administration of OZ solution.

During OMT, impulsive and uncontrolled substance use just prior to the violent acts that the participants were imprisoned for was reported. Yet, to conduct a (violent) criminal act does not necessarily imply that one is without moral principles.

Being simultaneously enrolled in OMT and imprisoned for a (violent) crime might evoke feelings of 'double' shame and guilt for both the criminal behavior prior to treatment and the actual case(s) one is imprisoned for while in OMT. Treatment providers should identify individuals with histories of violent behavior and, together with them, explore concrete episodes of violence and their emotional reactions. Particular attention should be given to potential relationships between substance use and violence and treatment approaches tailored accordingly.

Leaf extracts prepared by ethyl acetate extraction or supercritical extraction, previously determined to have 5.54 mg/g and 6.78 mg/g of the active principle, betulinic acid, respectively, reduced behavioural parameters associated with anxiety in a rat model. When animals were pretreated with the GABAA-BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil, followed by the plant extracts, or a more soluble derivative of the active principle, the methyl ester of betulinic acid (MeBA), flumazenil eliminated the anxiety-reducing effect of plant extracts and MeBA, demonstrating that S. sympetala acts via an agonist action on the GABAA-BZD receptor. An in vitro GABAA-BZD competitive receptor binding assay also demonstrated that S. sympetala extracts have an affinity for the GABAA-BZD receptor, with an EC50 value of 123 \u03bcg/mL (EtOAc leaf extract) and 154 \u03bcg/mL (supercritical CO2 extract).

The two conformational enantiomers of this class of benzodiazepines interconvert rapidly at room temperature by a simple ring flipping process. Low temperature HPLC on the Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phase allowed us to separate the conformational enantiomers of diazepam and of the related 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones, under conditions where the interconversion rate is sufficiently low, compared to the chromatographic separation rate. Diazepam, tetrazepam and prazepam showed temperature dependent dynamic HPLC profiles with interconversion plateaus indicative of on-column enantiomer interconversion (enantiomerization) in the temperature range between -10 \u00b0C and -35 \u00b0C, whereas for flunitrazepam on-column interconversion was observed at temperatures between -40 \u00b0C and -66 \u00b0C. Simulation of exchange-deformed HPLC profiles using a computer program based on the stochastic model yielded the apparent rate constants for the on-column enantiomerization and the corresponding free energy activation barriers. At -20 \u00b0C the enantiomerization barriers, \u0394G(\u2260), for diazepam, prazepam and tetrazepam were determined to be in the range 17.6-18.7 kcal/mol. At -55 \u00b0C \u0394G(\u2260) for flunitrazepam was determined to be in the 15.6-15.7 kcal/mol range.

    "184": "Chalcones are naturally occurring compounds exhibiting broad spectrum biological activities including anticancer activity through multiple mechanisms. Literature on anticancer chalcones highlights the employment of three pronged strategies, namely; structural manipulation of both aryl rings, replacement of aryl rings with heteroaryl scaffolds, molecular hybridization through conjugation with other pharmacologically interesting scaffolds for enhancement of anticancer properties. Methoxy substitutions on both the aryl rings (A and B) of the chalcones, depending upon their positions in the aryl rings appear to influence anticancer and other activities. Similarly, heterocyclic rings either as ring A or B in chalcones, also influence the anticancer activity shown by this class of compounds. Hybrid chalcones formulated by chemically linking chalcones to other prominent anticancer scaffolds such as pyrrol[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines, benzothiazoles, imidazolones have demonstrated synergistic or additive pharmacological activities. The successful application of these three pronged strategies for discovering novel anticancer agents based on chalcone scaffold has resulted in many novel and chemically diverse chalcones with potential therapeutic application for many types of cancer. This review summarizes the concerted efforts expended on the design and development of anticancer chalcones recorded in recent literature and also provides an overview of the patents published in this area between 2007 and 2014 (WO2013022951, WO201201745 & US2012029489).", 
    "185": "Cerebrovascular diseases are caused by interruption or significant impairment of the blood supply to the brain, which leads to a cascade of metabolic and molecular alterations resulting in functional disturbance and morphological damage. These pathophysiological changes can be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), which permits the regional measurement of physiological parameters and imaging of the distribution of molecular markers. PET has broadened our understanding of the flow and metabolic thresholds critical for the maintenance of brain function and morphology: in this application, PET has been essential in the transfer of the concept of the penumbra (tissue with perfusion below the functional threshold but above the threshold for the preservation of morphology) to clinical stroke and thereby has had great impact on developing treatment strategies. Radioligands for receptors can be used as early markers of irreversible neuronal damage and thereby can predict the size of the final infarcts; this is also important for decisions concerning invasive therapy in large (\"malignant\") infarctions. With PET investigations, the reserve capacity of blood supply to the brain can be tested in obstructive arteriosclerosis of the supplying arteries, and this again is essential for planning interventions. The effect of a stroke on the surrounding and contralateral primarily unaffected tissue can be investigated, and these results help to understand the symptoms caused by disturbances in functional networks. Chronic cerebrovascular disease causes vascular cognitive disorders, including vascular dementia. PET permits the detection of the metabolic disturbances responsible for cognitive impairment and dementia, and can differentiate vascular dementia from degenerative diseases. It may also help to understand the importance of neuroinflammation after stroke and its interaction with amyloid deposition in the development of dementia. Although the clinical application of PET investigations is limited, this technology had and still has a great impact on research into cerebrovascular diseases.",

A recent publication in this journal (Raju et al, PloS One, 2012, 7, 4, e35920) reported that two PBD molecules were observed to bind with high affinity to the telomeric quadruplex of Tetrahymena glaucoma based on Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS), Circular Dichroism, UV-Visible and Fluorescence spectroscopy data. This was a surprising result given the close 3-dimensional shape match between the structure of all PBD molecules and the minor groove of duplex DNA, and the completely different 3-dimensional structure of quadruplex DNA. Therefore, we evaluated the interaction of eight PBD molecules of diverse structure with a range of parallel, antiparallel and mixed DNA quadruplexes using DNA Thermal Denaturation, Circular Dichroism and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Those PBD molecules without large C8-substitutents had an insignificant affinity for the eight quadruplex types, although those with large \u03c0-system-containing C8-substituents (as with the compounds evaluated by Raju and co-workers) were found to interact to some extent. Our molecular dynamics simulations support the likelihood that molecules of this type, including those examined by Raju and co-workers, interact with quadruplex DNA through their C8-substituents rather than the PBD moiety itself. It is important for the literature to be clear on this matter, as the mechanism of action of these agents will be under close scrutiny in the near future due to the growing number of PBD-based agents entering the clinic as both single-agents and as components of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).",

Here, we show that CHK1 is overexpressed and hyperactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). CHEK1 mRNA is highly abundant in patients of the proliferative T-ALL subgroup and leukemia cells exhibit constitutively elevated levels of the replication stress marker phospho-RPA32 and the DNA damage marker \u03b3H2AX. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 using PF-004777736 or CHK1 short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing impairs T-ALL cell proliferation and viability. CHK1 inactivation results in the accumulation of cells with incompletely replicated DNA, ensuing DNA damage, ATM/CHK2 activation and subsequent ATM- and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. In contrast to normal thymocytes, primary T-ALL cells are sensitive to therapeutic doses of PF-004777736, even in the presence of stromal or interleukin-7 survival signals. Moreover, CHK1 inhibition significantly delays in vivo growth of xenotransplanted T-ALL tumors. We conclude that CHK1 is critical for T-ALL proliferation and viability by downmodulating replication stress and preventing ATM/caspase-3-dependent cell death.

In this study, the effects of a novel synthetic compound that mimics the neuroprotective properties of bFGF - SUN11602 - were examined in vitro and in vivo. SUN11602 promoted neurite outgrowth of primarily cultured rat hippocampal neurons. For the in vivo study, an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model with severe damage to the hippocampal tissue was constructed by injecting the hippocampi of rats with aggregated A\u03b21-40, followed 48 h later by an injection of ibotenate [an agonist for N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor]. Oral administration of SUN11602 at the midpoint of A\u03b21-40 and ibotenate injections attenuated short-term memory impairment in the Y-maze test, as well as spatial learning deficits in the water maze task. In addition, the SUN11602 treatment inhibited the increase of peripheral-type benzodiazepine-binding sites (PTBBS), which are a marker for gliosis. A negative correlation was found between PTBBS numbers and learning capacity in the water maze task. These results suggest that SUN111602 improved memory and learning deficits in the hippocampally lesioned rats by preventing neuronal death and/or promotion of neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results indicate that SUN11602, a bFGF-like compound with neuroprotective and neurite outgrowth activity, may be beneficial for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",

A 39.7\u00a0kb long DNA region contains 27 putative genes, 18 of them revealing high similarity with homologous genes from biosynthetic gene cluster of closely related pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) compound anthramycin. However, considering the structures of both compounds, the number of differences in the gene composition of compared biosynthetic gene clusters was unexpectedly high, indicating participation of alternative enzymes in biosynthesis of both porothramycin precursors, anthranilate, and branched L-proline derivative. Based on the sequence analysis of putative NRPS modules Por20 and Por21, we suppose that in porothramycin biosynthesis, the methylation of anthranilate unit occurs prior to the condensation reaction, while modifications of branched proline derivative, oxidation, and dimethylation of the side chain occur on already condensed PBD core. Corresponding two specific methyltransferase encoding genes por26 and por25 were identified in the porothramycin gene cluster. Surprisingly, also methyltransferase gene por18 homologous to orf19 from anthramycin biosynthesis was detected in porothramycin gene cluster even though the appropriate biosynthetic step is missing, as suggested by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-MS) analysis of the product in the S. albus culture broth.",

    "246": "Violent behaviour towards others is occasionally caused by drug therapy, through sometimes complex and often poorly understood mechanisms. The consequences described in detailed case reports can be serious, including homicide. Many neuropsychotropic drugs can induce violent behaviour: smoking cessation drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and dopamine agonists. Some drugs not used as psychotropic agents have also been implicated, for example: corticosteroids; anti-infective drugs such as mefloquine, efavirenz, atazanavir, ribavirin and alfa interferons; testosterone; and the asthma drug montelukast. The frequency of these adverse effects cannot be reliably assessed using the data available. Only certain reports mention a previous behaviour disorder. In practice, it is helpful to inform patients if the drugs they are taking can provoke violent behaviour. It is advisable to ask these patients about any behavioural changes and to encourage them to inform members of their family or carers, to ensure that these changes are identified and their consequences averted. In addition, remind them that alcohol increases the risk.",

We investigated the involvement of dopamine-D\u2083 receptors in the effects of blonanserin on cognitive impairment in an animal model of schizophrenia. We also sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this involvement. Blonanserin, as well as olanzapine, significantly ameliorated phencyclidine (PCP)-induced impairment of visual-recognition memory, as demonstrated by the novel-object recognition test (NORT) and increased extracellular dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). With blonanserin, both of these effects were antagonized by DOI (a serotonin 5-HT\u2082A receptor agonist) and 7-OH-DPAT (a dopamine-D\u2083 receptor agonist), whereas the effects of olanzapine were antagonized by DOI but not by 7-OH-DPAT. The ameliorating effect was also antagonized by SCH23390 (a dopamine-D\u2081 receptor antagonist) and H-89 (a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor). Blonanserin significantly remediated the decrease in phosphorylation levels of PKA at Thr(197) and of NR1 (an essential subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors) at Ser(897) by PKA in the mPFC after a NORT training session in the PCP-administered mice. There were no differences in the levels of NR1 phosphorylated at Ser(896) by PKC in any group. These results suggest that the ameliorating effect of blonanserin on PCP-induced cognitive impairment is associated with indirect functional stimulation of the dopamine-D\u2081-PKA-NMDA receptor pathway following augmentation of dopaminergic neurotransmission due to inhibition of both dopamine-D\u2083 and serotonin 5-HT\u2082A receptors in the mPFC.", 
    "248": "Insufficient treatment of psychosis often manifests as violent and aggressive behaviors that are dangerous to the patient and others, and that warrant treatment strategies which are not considered first-line, evidence-based practices. Such treatment strategies include both antipsychotic polypharmacy (simultaneous use of 2 antipsychotics) and high-dose antipsychotic monotherapy. Here we discuss the hypothesized neurobiological substrates of various types of violence and aggression, as well as providing arguments for the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy and high-dose monotherapy to target dysfunctional neurocircuitry in the subpopulation of patients that is treatment-resistant, violent, and aggressive. In this review, we focus primarily on the data supporting the use of second-generation, atypical antipsychotics both at high doses and in combination with other antipsychotics.", 
    "249": "Early recognition of a cardio-pulmonary arrest (CPA) is crucial for patient survival. Every non-breathing and non-responsive patient should be considered to have CPA, and examination of the vital signs should last no longer than 5-10 seconds. If in doubt, effective chest compressions should be started immediately (frequency of 100-120 compressions per minute, compression depth one third to half of the chest diameter, full chest wall recoil between the compressions, no interruption, change of compressing person every 2 minutes). Furthermore, the patient should be intubated and ventilated as early as possible with a frequency of 10\u00a0breaths per minute and a volume of 10\u00a0ml/kg. Additional measures include monitoring (electrocardiogram, end-expiratory carbon dioxide concentration), placement of an intravenous or intraosseous catheter, administration of opioid-, benzodiazepine- and/or \u03b12-antagonists and ECG-dependent therapy to restore spontaneous circulation. In the case of asystole and pulseless electric activity, epinephrine (0.01\u00a0mg/kg every 3-5 minutes, alternative dose concept: 0.1\u00a0mg/kg epinephrine) is advised. In the case of CPA due to elevated vagal tonus or bradycardia, atropine should be given (0.04\u00a0mg/kg every 3-5 minutes). If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachyarrhythmia is present, defibrillation is the therapy of choice. When this is not possible, amiodarone (5\u00a0mg/kg) or lidocaine (2\u00a0mg/kg) should be administered. Furthermore, 100% oxygen should be given during resuscitation, while only a few patients benefit from infusion therapy. Following the return of spontaneous circulation, intensive care of the patient is necessary. This involves intense monitoring and support of the haemodynamic situation using intravenous fluids, vasopressors and positive inotropic drugs as well as an improvement of gas exchange and neuroprotection."
