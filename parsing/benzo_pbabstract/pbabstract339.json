    "0": "The use of ketamine as a sole anesthetic induces marked central sympathetic stimulation, causing increased heart rate, blood pressure (BP), and oxygen consumption (VO2). Both alpha 2-agonists and benzodiazepines have been used to attenuate these potentially harmful ketamine-induced responses. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the perioperative metabolic, hemodynamic, and sympathoadrenal responses to IM clonidine (2 micrograms/kg) and midazolam (70 micrograms/kg) premedication during ketamine anesthesia. VO2 was measured continuously using indirect calorimetry in 30 ASA physical status I patients. The patients received ketamine, mivacurium, and fentanyl for the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained using a ketamine infusion and fentanyl boluses i.v. Preoperatively, both VO2 and BP decreased significantly after the administration clonidine and midazolam compared with placebo (P < 0.01). Intraoperatively, VO2 was higher in the midazolam group than in the placebo and clonidine groups (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in BP and VO2, although they stayed at lower level in the clonidine group during the whole postoperative period. Clonidine decreased pre- and postoperative plasma catecholamine concentrations (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that a midazolam-ketamine combination may induce potentially harmful metabolic stimulation, whereas the sympatholytic effects of clonidine on ketamine-anesthetized patients may be beneficial, as perioperative VO2 was decreased.", 
    "1": "Ketamine causes sympathetic stimulation with an ensuing increase in oxygen consumption. Anticipating that clonidine might attenuate this response, we measured oxygen consumption in patients undergoing surgery during ketamine anesthesia. Patients treated with a clonidine-ketamine combination had lower intra- and postoperative oxygen consumption than those treated with a midazolam-ketamine combination.", 
    "2": "Many patients who receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are benzodiazepine dependent or are anxious and require benzodiazepine drugs. Because these agents may diminish the therapeutic effectiveness of ECT, we explored the dosing, safety, and efficacy of pre-ECT flumazenil administration, a benzodiazepine-competitive antagonist, in patients receiving benzodiazepine medications. We report our experience with 35 patients who received both flumazenil and benzodiazepine drugs during their ECT course. We compared seizure duration with and without flumazenil and compared treatment efficacy to 49 patients who received ECT without either of these medications. Flumazenil could be safely administered with ECT. A few subjects taking higher chronic benzodiazepine dosages experienced breakthrough anxiety or withdrawal symptoms, which were well managed by dosing flumazenil immediately before the anesthetic agent and by immediate posttreatment benzodiazepine administration. A dose of 0.4-0.5 mg was adequate for all but those taking the highest benzodiazepine dosages, where 0.8-1.0 mg resulted in a clinically more effective reversal. No differences in efficacy or seizure duration were found as a function of flumazenil administration. Flumazenil offers the promise of safe and effective ECT in patients receiving benzodiazepine drugs. Follow-up outcome investigation on a random assignment basis will be necessary for definitive assessment of the value of flumazenil. In addition, the direct effect of benzodiazepine drugs and the flumazenil/benzodiazepine combination on ECT seizures remains to be determined.", 
    "3": "1. Using an in vitro slice preparation of the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the properties of retinogeniculate and corticothalamic inputs to thalamocortical (TC) neurones were examined in the absence of GABAergic inhibition. 2. The retinogeniculate EPSP evoked at low frequency (>= 0.1 Hz) consisted of one or two fast-rising (0.8 +/- 0.1 ms), large-amplitude (10.3 +/- 1.6 mV) unitary events, while the corticothalamic EPSP had a graded relationship with stimulus intensity, owing to its slower-rising (2.9 +/- 0.4 ms), smaller-amplitude (1.3 +/- 0.3 mV) estimated unitary components. 3. The retinogeniculate EPSP exhibited a paired-pulse depression of 60.3 +/- 5.6 % at 10 Hz, while the corticothalamic EPSP exhibited a paired-pulse facilitation of > 150 %. This frequency-dependent depression of the retinogeniculate EPSP was maximal after the second stimulus, while the frequency-dependent facilitation of the corticothalamic EPSP was maximal after the fourth or fifth stimulus, at interstimulus frequencies of 1-10 Hz. 4. There was a short-term enhancement of the >= 0.1 Hz corticothalamic EPSP (64.6 +/- 9.2 %), but not the retinogeniculate EPSP, following trains of stimuli at 50 Hz. 5. The >= 0.1 Hz corticothalamic EPSP was markedly depressed by the non-NMDA antagonist 1-(4-amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylene-dioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466), but only modestly by the NMDA antagonist 3-((RS)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid ((RS)-CPP), and completely blocked by the co-application of GYKI 52466, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), (RS)-CPP and (5R, 10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine (MK-801). Likewise, the corticothalamic responses to trains of stimuli (1-500 Hz) were greatly reduced by this combination of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. 6. In the presence of GYKI 52466, CNQX, (RS)-CPP and MK-801, residual corticothalamic responses and slow EPSPs, with a time to peak of 2-10 s, could be generated following trains of five to fifty stimuli. Neither of these responses were occluded by 1S,3R-1-aminocyclopentane-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), suggesting they are not mediated via group I and II metabotropic glutamate receptors.",

Besides the use of clomethiazole, clonidine, and benzodiazepines, there is another possible way to prevent AWS by deliberate administration of ethanol. The appropriate dosage of ethanol has not been known up to now and it could be defined according to the average ethanol elimination rate (EER) which, from forensic analysis, is known to be 15 mg/dl per h in a normal population.

    "18": "In a prospective, double-blind, controlled, randomized study, the psychomotor functions and sedation were assessed after premedication with diazepam and clonidine in children. Forty children in the age-group of 5-8 years, undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were studied. Twenty children (group 1) received oral clonidine 4 microg/kg, and 20 children (group 2) received oral diazepam 0.2 mg/kg, 120 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Sedation and psychomotor functions were assessed in both groups, before and after 60-90 minutes of administration of premedication. The results of the study showed that mean sedation score in group 1 was 8 +/- 1.07, and 9 +/- 0.64 in group 2. On intergroup comparison the sedation was found to be comparatively better in group 2 than group 1 (p < 0.05). The performance of psychomotor functions decreased after premedication in both the groups as compared to that before premedication (p < 0.05). The psychomotor functions were depressed more in diazepam group than in the clonidine group (p < 0.05). Thus, it is concluded that clonidine produces good sedation and causes less effect on psychomotor functions and therefore can be used for premedication in children.",

Ratings of clinical status, extrapyramidal side effects, and prolactin levels were also obtained.", 
    "21": "Olanzapine induced near saturation of the 5-HT2 receptors, even at 5 mg/day. Its D2 occupancy increased with dose: patients taking 5-20 mg/day showed 43%-80% D2 occupancy, while patients taking 30-40 mg/day showed 83%-88%.", 
    "22": "Olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2 blocker and shows a higher 5-HT2 than D2 occupancy at all doses. However, its D2 occupancy is higher than that of clozapine and similar to that of risperidone. In the usual clinical dose range of 10-20 mg/day, its occupancy varies from 71% to 80%, and this restricted range may explain its freedom from extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin elevation. However, doses of 30 mg/day and higher are associated with more than 80% D2 occupancy and may have a higher likelihood of prolactin elevation and extrapyramidal side effects.",

    "27": "Using histochemical and immunocytochemical methods, cholinergic nerve fibres were demonstrated in the rat adrenal cortex, primarily in the capsule and zona glomerulosa, and in the medulla. Some terminated among the glomerulosa cells or around blood vessels. Occasional fibres were also seen in the fasciculata, ending in islets of chromaffin tissue without ramifications on cortical cells. To clarify the role of cholinergic innervation, a microvolume perifusion system was used to study steroid production by the rat adrenal capsule-glomerulosa. Acetylcholine (ACh) itself had no reproducible effects; however, since variable amounts of endogenous ACh were present, the actions of antagonists were also studied. The M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine (10 and 100 microM) stimulated aldosterone secretion. This stimulation was abolished by co-incubation with carbachol, the M1 agonist McN A-343 and by atropine. We found that the action of pirenzepine was blocked by nifedipine (Ca2+ channel blocker), suggesting that pirenzepine (through release of endogenous ACh) provides an acute stimulus by enhancing Ca2+ inflow. Hemicholine, a choline uptake blocker, reduced the stimulatory effect of pirenzepine on steroid secretion, confirming that stimulation was of neural origin. Neither the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, the selective M1-M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist 4-DAMP, nor the selective M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist methoctramine influenced aldosterone output. Receptor-binding studies revealed the existence of M3 receptors in capsule-glomerulosa homogenates. We conclude that pirenzepine acts on presynaptic M1 autoreceptors to increase spontaneous ACh release from varicose axon terminals that lie in close proximity to the glomerulosa cells. In turn ACh may thus stimulate steroidogenesis acutely through M3 receptors. These results support the concept of a direct cholinergic influence on zona glomerulosa function in the rat.", 
    "28": "We investigated the effect of adenosine on hypnosis induced by thiopentone, propofol and midazolam in mice. The onset and duration of hypnosis were determined by the loss of righting reflex. Adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine caused a significant shortening of onset of sleep-time and prolongation of duration of sleep-time in all groups (p < 0.05). Dipyridamole administration before combined intravenous anaesthetic-adenosine or intravenous anaesthetic-2-chloroadenosine administration produced similar effects to adenosine (p < 0.05). The adenosine antagonist theophylline, given before intravenous anaesthetic-adenosine or intravenous anaesthetic-2-chloroadenosine administration caused a significant delay in onset of sleep-time and shortening in the duration of sleep-time (p < 0.05). We conclude that central excitatory noradrenergic neurones play an important role in adenosine, 2-chloroadenosine and dipyridamole-induced hypnotic responses to intravenous anaesthetics and their inhibition by adenosine antagonists.", 
    "29": "Analysis of heart rate variability has been used to study the effects of midazolam, morphine and clonidine on the autonomic nervous system, when administered to patients for premedication. Ninety-five patients were studied 60 min before and 60 min after premedication. Normal saline (n = 25), midazolam 0.08 mg.kg-1 (n = 24), morphine 0.15 mg.kg-1 (n = 23), or clonidine 2 micrograms.kg-1 (n = 23) were administered intramuscularly by random allocation. A Holter device was connected to the patient during the study period. Using power spectral analysis the low-frequency and high-frequency components were calculated from the Holter recordings. These are markers for sympathetic and parasympathetic activity respectively; the low- to high-frequency ratio was also calculated, a ratio of > 1 signifying sympathetic dominance. A significant reduction was noticed in both low-frequency and high-frequency power in the three premedicated groups, whereas no changes were observed in the normal saline group. In the case of midazolam, both the low and high frequencies were decreased but the low- to high-frequency ratio did not change significantly. Morphine and clonidine depressed the low-frequency component more than the high-frequency component and the low- to high-frequency ratio was decreased, suggesting parasympathetic dominance. We conclude that heart rate variability may be a useful tool for investigating the effect of drugs on the autonomic nervous system.",

Receptor affinity gradually and remarkably increases by moving the nitrogen atom of the central ring from position 3 through 4 to position 5, to give the most effective compound 6a (Ki = 150 nM). N-methylation of the diazepine ring (7a) lowers receptorial binding. Introduction of a chlorine atom on the benzene ring doubles the Ki value (6b) which remains unaltered by the N-methylation (7b).", 
    "31": "Many of the pharmacological effects of melatonin have been found to be similar to those of benzodiazepines. In the present study, we analyzed the role of melatonin on short-term memory retrieval on transfer latency in elevated plus maze and food consumption behavior, and the effects were compared with those of diazepam. Melatonin dose-dependently (10-100 mg/kg) produced short-term memory deficit and it potentiated diazepam- (1 mg/kg) induced cognitive deficit in mice. Flumazenil (1 and 4 mg/kg) could reverse enhancement in diazepam-induced memory deficit by melatonin. Chronic treatment with melatonin (10 mg/kg/7d) produced a similar profile in transfer latency on elevated plus maze compared with that of diazepam. In a food consumption behavior study, melatonin (25 and 50 mg/kg) produced a significant hyperphagic effect compared to control. Flumazenil (4 mg/kg) could significantly reverse the hyperphagic effects induced by diazepam (2 mg/kg), but would be insignificant with regard to that due to melatonin. These findings provide further evidence that some of the pharmacological effects of melatonin are comparable with those of diazepam and may involve central GABAergic mechanism.", 
    "32": "The slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current, IKs, is an important modulator of cardiac action potential repolarization. Here, we describe a novel benzodiazepine, [L-364,373 [(3-R)-1, 3-dihydro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-1-methyl-2H- 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one] (R-L3), that activates IKs and shortens action potentials in guinea pig cardiac myocytes. These effects were additive to isoproterenol, indicating that channel activation by R-L3 was independent of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. The increase of IKs by R-L3 was stereospecific; the S-enantiomer, S-L3, blocked IKs at all concentrations examined. The increase in IKs by R-L3 was greatest at voltages near the threshold for normal channel activation, caused by a shift in the voltage dependence of IKs activation. R-L3 slowed the rate of IKs deactivation and shifted the half-point of the isochronal (7.5 sec) activation curve for IKs by -16 mV at 0.1 microM and -24 mV at 1 microM. R-L3 had similar effects on cloned KvLQT1 channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes but did not affect channels formed by coassembly of KvLQT1 and hminK subunits. These findings indicate that the association of minK with KvLQT1 interferes with the binding of R-L3 or prevents its action once bound to KvLQT1 subunits.", 
    "33": "Photoincorporation of ligands into the benzodiazepine site of native gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors provides useful information about the nature of the benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site. Photoincorporation of flunitrazepam into a single population of GABAA receptors, recombinant human alpha1beta3gamma2, was investigated to probe further the mechanism and orientation of flunitrazepam and other ligands in the BZ binding site. It was concluded that the receptor is primarily derivatized with the entire, unfragmented, flunitrazepam molecule, which undergoes a conformational change during photolysis and largely vacates the benzodiazepine binding site. Investigation of the BZ site after photoincorporation of [3H]flunitrazepam confirmed that binding of other radioligands was unaffected by incorporation of flunitrazepam. This did not correlate with their efficacy but depended on the presence of particular structural features in the molecule. It was observed that affected compounds have a pendant phenyl moiety, analogous to the 5-phenyl group of flunitrazepam, which are proposed to overlap and interact with the same residue or residues in the BZ binding site. Because the major site of flunitrazepam photoincorporation has been shown to be His102, we propose that this group of compounds interacts directly with His 102, whereas compounds of other structural types have no direct interaction with this amino acid. The orientation of ligands within the BZ binding site and their specific interaction with identified amino acids are not well understood. The data in the current study indicate that His102 interacts directly with the pendant phenyl group of diazepam, and further implications for the pharmacophore of the BZ binding site are discussed.",

The most prevalent symptoms were ataxia (87%), lethargy (57%), coma (Glasgow coma score < 15, 35%; Reed coma score > 0, 22%), and respiratory depression (9%). Duration of symptoms was less than 24 hours in 88% of patients. Isolated ataxia occurred in eight patients; in five of these patients, benzodiazepine ingestion was unsuspected by the physicians. Three parents intentionally administered the benzodiazepine to their child. Only 50% of 32 toxicology screens were positive for benzodiazepines. One child required endotracheal intubation.

Although the role of cholesterol in tumorigenesis is not clear it is known that steroids are important factors in human carcinogenesis. A polypeptide, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), which is an endogenous ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors enhances steroidigenesis by promoting cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane which represents the rate-limiting step of steroid biosynthesis. We have assayed the total cholesterol (TC) and the DBI plasma concentrations in patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison with those of uncomplicated liver cirrhosis. TC and DBI levels have been studied in 73 cirrhotic patients and in 23 patients with HCC. Both TC and DBI levels were higher in HCC patients when compared with age, sex and Child-Pugh class matched cirrhotic controls. The values (mean+/-S.D.) in patients in Child-Pugh class B and C with and without HCC were respectively 128+/-30 mg/dl vs. 106+/-27 mg/dl (P < 0.01) and 2.05+/-0.78 pmol/ml vs. 0.78+/-0.84 pmol/ml (P < 0.0001).

    "52": "Patients with chronic orofacial pain often report disturbances in sleep, leading to the hypothesis that nocturnal motor hyperactivity of the muscles of mastication may contribute to the nociceptive process. This hypothesis was tested in a controlled study to evaluate the relationship between sleep stages, patient self-report of pain in the orofacial region, and nocturnal masticatory muscle activity. Twenty subjects participating in a two-period, within-subject, crossover study received triazolam or placebo for 4 nights. Sleep, pain, and mandibular range of motion were assessed at baseline, following the first period, and again following the second period; a 3-day washout period separated the two treatments. Subjective report of sleep quality was significantly improved following triazolam in comparison to placebo as measured by category scales for sleep quality, restfulness, and sleep compared to usual. The amount of time spent in stage-2 sleep was also significantly increased by triazolam. No improvement was seen in pain as measured by palpation with an algometer, in scales for sensory intensity and the affective component of pain, or in daily pain diaries. Mean facial muscle electromyographic activity for 30-second epochs averaged over the entire period of sleep did not reveal any differences in muscle activity across the three conditions. These data indicate that improvements in sleep quality and alterations in sleep architecture do not affect nocturnal facial muscle activity or subsequent pain report in temporomandibular patients, thereby failing to support the hypothesized relationship between sleep disturbances and chronic orofacial pain.",

This review of relevant literature has revealed a lack of documentation on the adverse effects of zopiclone. The similarities between zopiclone and benzodiazepine hypnotics are more striking than the differences. The bulk of comparative research has been carried out with triazolam, a drug taken off the Norwegian market in 1991. With zopiclone there is less inhibition of psychomotor function the day after intake than with flunitrazepam. Zopiclone causes less subjective \"hangover\" than nitrazepam, but there is a similar inhibition of psychomotor function the day after intake, and in some cases greater addictive potential.", 
    "54": "Ro 5-4864, a specific agonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), elicited convulsions 2.6 times more potently in EL mice (an animal model of epilepsy) than in DDY mice (control animal). A binding assay revealed a 50% higher density of [3H] Ro 5-4864 binding sites in the mitochondrial fraction (i.e., mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors; MBR) of the brain tissues in EL mice as compared with DDY mice. On an elevated plus-maze, EL mice showed fear responses similar to those increased in DDY mice after PBR stimulation, suggesting a hyperfunction of MBR underlying the abnormal behaviors of EL mice. In fluorometric studies using NG108-15 cells, Ro 5-4864 depolarized mitochondrial membranes and, possibly as a consequence of this, raised intracellular Ca2+. Finally, we propose that MBR could be a major target of therapy for various neurological disorders, so drugs such as \"mitochondrial membrane stabilizers\" should be developed.", 
    "55": "Recently, a polyspecific organic cation transporter, hOCT1, was cloned from human liver. To date, limited studies examining the functional characteristics of the transporter have been performed. The purpose of the present study was to develop a mammalian expression system for hOCT1 and to characterize the interactions of various compounds with the cloned transporter. Lipofection was used to transiently transfect the hOCT1 plasmid DNA in a human cell line, HeLa. We tested the interaction of an array of organic cations and other compounds with hOCT1 by determining Ki values in inhibiting 14C-tetraethylammonium (TEA) transport in the transfected cells. Transient expression of hOCT1 activity was observed between 24 and 72 hr post-transfection, with maximal expression at approximately 40 hr. TEA transport was temperature dependent and saturable with Vmax and K(m) values of 2.89 +/- 0.448 nmol/mg protein/30 min and 229 +/- 78.4 microM, respectively. 14C-TEA uptake in hOCT1 plasmid DNA-transfected HeLa cells was trans-stimulated by unlabeled TEA and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium. Organic cations, including clonidine, quinine, quinidine and verapamil (0.1 mM), significantly inhibited 14C-TEA uptake, whereas the organic anion, p-aminohippuric acid (5 mM), did not. The neutral compounds, corticosterone (Ki, 7.0 microM) and midazolam (Ki, 3.7 microM) potently inhibited 14C-TEA uptake. The Ki values of several compounds in interacting with hOCT1 differed substantially from the corresponding values for the rat organic cation transporter, rOCT1, and the human kidney-specific organic cation transporter, hOCT2, determined in previous studies. Transiently transfected HeLa cells represent a useful tool in studying the interactions and kinetics of organic cations and other xenobiotics with hOCT1 and in understanding the molecular events involved in organic cation transport.", 
    "56": "The ability of the M2 muscarinic receptor to inhibit the relaxant effects of forskolin and isoproterenol was investigated in bovine trachea. In most experiments, we measured contractile responses to oxotremorine-M in smooth muscle isolated from bovine trachea in which a majority of M3 receptors were inactivated by treatment with N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate. In the presence of histamine (20 microM), the histamine H2 antagonist cimetidine (10 microM) and forskolin (4 microM), responses to oxotremorine-M were antagonized by [[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (1 microM) in a manner consistent with contractions mediated predominantly by M2 receptors. When similar experiments were conducted in the presence of isoproterenol (0.1 microM) instead of forskolin, contractions were antagonized in a manner consistent with an M3 receptor-mediated response. In similar experiments, we measured the relaxant potency of isoproterenol and forskolin against histamine-induced contractions in N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate-treated trachea. By itself, oxotremorine-M (7.5 nM) had no contractile effect; however, it caused a substantial reduction in the relaxant potency of forskolin although having little effect on that of isoproterenol. These experiments establish that M2 receptors inhibit the relaxant effects of forskolin, but not isoproterenol. In untreated tissues, the relaxant responses to isoproterenol and forskolin were 10.8- and 14.2-fold more potent, respectively, against histamine than against oxotremorine-M-induced contractions of equal magnitude. Similarly, the maximal stimulation of cAMP accumulation elicited by isoproterenol and forskolin was inhibited 58 and 62%, respectively, in the presence of oxotremorine-M (80 nM) compared to that measured in the presence of histamine (20 microM). Analysis of the data indicated that isoproterenol elicited relaxation at concentrations well beyond those that stimulated maximal levels of cAMP accumulation. Our results indicate that part of the relaxant response to isoproterenol is mediated through a non-cAMP-dependent mechanism, and that this mechanism is largely unopposed by the M2 receptor.", 
    "57": "Our aim was to determine if mucosal mast cells could be activated by endogenous CCK and, as a consequence, mediate CCK actions in the small intestine. Rats were prepared for electromyography to record electrical activity in the small intestine. In another group of animals, the duodenum was perfused to measure rat mast cell protease II (RMCP II) as indicative of mast cell degranulation. Endogenous CCK release was induced by administration of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) in conscious rats or by intraduodenal perfusion of ovalbumin hydrolysate (OVH) in anesthetized rats. CCK concentration was measured by bioassay on pancreatic acini. SBTI in control rats disrupted migrating motor complexes (MMC) for >40 min. In rats treated with the mast cell stabilizer ketotifen, SBTI did not induce any change in the MMC pattern. RMCP II concentration in the duodenal perfusate significantly increased after OVH. Perfusate from ketotifen-treated animals did not show any significant increase in RMCP II values during OVH perfusion, although CCK plasma concentration was not different from the control group. Furthermore, infusion of the CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260 significantly blocked the increase of RMCP II concentration after OVH. Our results indicate that mucosal mast cells are degranulated by endogenous CCK release through stimulation of CCK-B receptors. Therefore mucosal mast cells participate in CCK intestinal actions.", 
    "58": "The localisation of M1-M4 muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes was investigated in sections of normal human term placenta by light microscope autoradiography. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes were found almost exclusively in syncytiotrophoblast. Neither other cellular components of placenta, nor blood vessels were labelled. Quantitative analysis of the density of silver grains developed in sections incubated with the different protocols for labelling M1-M4 receptor subtypes, revealed that syncytiotrophoblast expresses all subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptor investigated. A higher density of binding sites was found in the apical than in the basal portion of syncytiotrophoblast. The demonstration of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in syncytiotrophoblast suggests that a cholinergic system may have a role in regulating transport of compounds from maternal to foetal interface.", 
    "59": "Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a cytokine which plays a central role in megakaryopoiesis and platelet production by binding to its cell surface receptor, termed c-Mpl. In the present study, two benzodiazepinones that compete with the binding of TPO to the extracellular region of c-Mpl were identified, and one of them stimulated the proliferation of a human TPO-dependent megakaryocytic cell line, UT-7/TPO. It stimulated the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 in UT-7/TPO cells. These results suggest that a non-peptide compound can mimic the effect of TPO via c-Mpl.", 
    "60": "A simple, rapid, sensitive and selective HPLC method has been developed for the analysis of diazepam (DZP) and its major metabolites, N-desmethyldiazepam (DMDZP), temazepam (TZP) and oxazepam (OZP), in plasma and urine, using clonazepam (CZP) as the internal standard and chloroform as the extracting solvent, with a 10 ng/ml limit of quantitation for the four assayed drugs, and an average (+/-S.D.) recovery of 87.7+/-6.46%, 92.9+/-5.31%, 91.4+/-4.01% and 91.7+/-2.68% for DZP, DMDZP, TZP and OZP, respectively (from plasma), and 89.6+/-2.26%, 90+/-4.24%, 87.45+/-0.64% and 94.50+/-0.71% for DZP, DMDZP, TZP and OZP, respectively (from urine). The method has also proved to be selective and reproducible.", 
    "61": "We investigated the possible association between delta and gamma2 subunits in native GABA(A) receptors, from different rat brain regions, using subunit-specific anti-delta and anti-gamma2 antibodies. Previous reports have provided somewhat controversial results, indicating both the presence and the absence of association between these two subunits in native receptors. Our results indicate the absence of co-localization between delta and gamma2 subunits. In immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-delta antibody consistently immunoprecipitated [3H]muscimol binding activity (GABA binding sites) from all brain areas tested (10-20% of the total binding). However, under the same conditions, no significant [3H]flumazenil or [3H]ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazol[1,5-a]-[1,4]benzodiazepine- 3-carboxylate (Ro15-4513) binding (benzodiazepine binding sites) activity was detected in the immunopellets. These results indicate the absence of association between delta and gamma2 subunits. This question was directly addressed by immunopurification and Western blot experiments. As expected, no gamma2 subunits were detected in anti-delta immunoaffinity purified receptors. Conversely, no delta subunits were identified in anti-gamma2 immunopurified receptors. Thus, these results demonstrate the absence of association between delta and gamma2 subunits in native GABA(A) receptors. Finally, our results also indicate the relevance of the solubilization conditions on the apparent association between different subunits of the native GABA(A) receptor complex.", 
    "62": "We investigated the effects of a novel benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, S-8510 (2-(3-isoxazolyl)-3,6,7,9-tetrahydroimidazo [4,5-d] pyrano [4,3-b] pyridine monophosphate monohydrate), on the impairment of spatial memory, decreased high-affinity choline uptake and acetylcholine release in basal forebrain-lesioned rats. S-8510 (3 and 5 mg/kg, p.o. 30 min before each training session) significantly ameliorated the basal forebrain-lesion-induced impairment of spatial memory in water maze task. In vivo brain microdialysis studies showed that systemic administration of S-8510 at 3 and 10 mg/kg significantly increased the release of acetylcholine in the front-parietal cortex in basal forebrain-lesioned rats. Further, repeated administration of S-8510 (3 and 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 5 days) reversed the decrease in cortical high-affinity choline uptake induced by basal forebrain lesion. Thus, S-8510 improved the spatial memory impairment induced by lesion of the basal forebrain in rats. In addition, it increased acetylcholine release and high-affinity choline uptake from the cortex, a region closely associated with memory, in basal forebrain-lesioned rats. These results indicate that S-8510 has cognition enhancing and cholinergic-activating effects in the basal forebrain-lesioned rats, suggesting that this agent may be useful for the treatment of mild to moderate senile dementia including Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "63": "Dramatic changes have recently occurred in the availability of treatment options for bipolar illness. Second generation mood stabilizing anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are now widely used as alternatives or adjuncts to lithium. High potency benzodiazepines are also used as alternatives to typical neuroleptics, and now atypical neuroleptics are demonstrating efficacy and better side-effects profiles than the typicals. Thyroid augmentation strategies and dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blockers require further clinical trials to define their role. Putative third generation mood stabilizing anticonvulsants lamotrigine, gabapentin, and topiramate have unique mechanisms of action and deserve further systematic study, as does the potential role for nonconvulsive brain stimulation with repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). These and a host of other potential treatment options now require a new generation of clinical trials to help identify clinical and biological markers of response and optimal use alone and in complex combination therapeutic regimens.", 
    "64": "Psychoneuroimmunology is a growing scientific field which deals with the mutual interplay between nervous and immune systems. In this framework, many data have demonstrated that cytokines (CKs) derived from the periphery are able to cross the blood brain barrier and act upon the central nervous system (CNS) [e.g., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA)], thus regulating several physiological functions (thermoregulation, sleep, appetite) or damaging the nervous tissue, when released in exaggerated amounts. On the other hand, nervous cells, such as astrocytes and microglial cells also generate proinflammatory CKs which may be detrimental for the CNS. The neuromodulating CK network can be triggered by microorganisms and/or their products (i.e. bacterial endotoxins), but also stressful life events may activate the HPAA, thus affecting the immune system function. This review will place emphasis on some clinical conditions, such as phobia and migraine without aura (MWA), characterized by anxiety disorders. Patients affected by these neuropsychiatric alterations exhibit multiple functional deficits of phagocytes and T lymphocytes which allow penetration of various pathogens into the host. This is also supported by the detection of circulating bacterial endotoxins and the evidence of both spontaneous and induced exaggerated release of proinflammatory CKs in phobic and MWA patients. The possible iatrogenic effects of benzodiazepines (BDZ) on the immune system have been evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In this respect, it emerges that diazepam exerts an inhibitory function on the immune system, while alprazolam behaves as an immunoenhancer. The presence of central and/or peripheral BDZ receptors on immune cells seems to be the key mechanism responsible for the immunomodulation exerted by these drugs.", 
    "65": "This study consists of two parts, first to compare the pharmacological profile of atropine and CEB-1957 substance toward muscarinic receptor subtypes. In various rat brain structures, binding properties were determined by competition experiments of [3H]pirenzepine, [3H]AF-DX 384, and [3H]4-DAMP in quantitative autoradiography of M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes, respectively. Competition curves have shown that atropine presents similar nanomolar inhibition constants toward each subtype, while CEB-1957 has distinct affinities (Ki from 0.26 to 73 nM) with the following range order: M3 > or = M2 > M1. The second part is to compare atropine and CEB-1957 (in combination with pralidoxime) for their ability to protect against the lethality induced by 2 x LD50 of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor sarin. CEB-1957 reduced the mortality at doses 10 times lower than atropine. Finally, from these results, it is proposed that a selective blockade of M2 and M3 receptor subtypes could play a pivotal role in the protective effect against sarin poisoning.", 
    "66": "We investigated whether acetylcholine affects cardiac action potentials through the muscarinic M1 in addition to M2 receptors in spontaneously beating mouse isolated right atria. A conventional glass microelectrode technique was used for the purpose. Acetylcholine (3-10 microM) reduced the maximum upstroke velocity of the action potentials (Vmax), followed by an increase. It shortened action potential duration at 90% repolarization, hyperpolarized the resting membrane and decreased the rate of beating. Atropine (3-100 nM) concentration dependently antagonized these effects of acetylcholine. Pirenzepine (10 and 30 nM), a selective muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, antagonized acetylcholine (5 microM)-induced reduction of Vmax without affecting other effects of acetylcholine. In addition, pirenzepine (30 nM) induced an immediate and linear acceleration of the VmaX reduced by acetylcholine. In contrast, AF-DX 116 (11(\u00bf2-[(diethylamino)-methyl]-1-piperidyl\u00bfacetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6 H-pyridol[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one base, 30-300 nM), a selective muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist, failed to antagonize acetylcholine-induced reduction of Vmax, but abolished its increase. It antagonized the shortening of action potential duration, membrane hyperpolarization and decreased the beating rate. McN-A-343 (4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride, 100 and 300 microM), a muscarinic M1 receptor agonist, reduced Vmax and prolonged action potential duration, while oxotremorine (100-300 nM), a muscarinic M2 receptor agonist, evoked reverse effects. These results suggest that acetylcholine exerts a mixed effect on Vmax, consisting of a reduction and a facilitation, possibly mediated by concurrent activation of muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors, respectively, in isolated right atria of mice.", 
    "67": "Midazolam increased the shorter-response rate and decreased the reinforcement rate of a contingency-controlled timing behavior--a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 45-s schedule. The responding rate changes observed were immediately interpretable as functions of midazolam concentration during a 3-h session--a period for investigating the onset, peak, and disappearance of midazolam effect--in rats. That the midazolam pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was a direct application of our alprazolam pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model implies that both drugs exhibit similar pharmacological effects. The two peaks of the shorter-response rate increases produced by midazolam were modeled as a stimulation-sedation model that consisted of two opposing effect-link sigmoidal Emax functions. The stimulation-sedation model suggested that midazolam possesses both stimulatory and sedative effects in a continuous but sequential fashion, and hypothesizes the coexistence of stimulation and sedation components for midazolam; this model may help delineate possible mechanisms for rebound side effects and of tolerance in humans. The reinforcement rate was, then, an index for evaluating the deficit in timing performance.", 
    "68": "The effect of benzodiazepine agonists of varying efficacy on gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor alpha1 subunit protein expression was determined in primary cultured cerebellar granule cells. After 48 h exposure to 1 microM drug concentrations, flunitrazepam, diazepam, and the partial agonists Ro 19-8022 and bretazenil, but not the partial agonists Ro 42-8773, Ro 41-7812 or imidazenil, decreased alpha1 subunit protein expression. The grading of effect of the benzodiazepine partial agonists on alpha1 subunit protein expression is consistent with their agonist efficacies. This model, therefore, appears to act as a sensitive indicator of benzodiazepine agonist efficacy with the ability to differentiate between partial agonists.", 
    "69": "The work is aimed at the preparation and characterization of biodegradable microspheres of poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), for the controlled release of clonazepam. The solubility characteristics of this drug make it an interesting example to evaluate the performances of the two most widely used microencapsulation techniques, emulsification solvent evaporation and spray-drying. Several biodegradable PLGA copolymers have been evaluated (RG 502H, RG 503H, RG 503, Boerhinger Ingelheim). They differ in terms of molecular weight and physico-chemical characteristics. The microspheres obtained have been characterized for their morphology, physico-chemical properties (DSC) and in vitro dissolution behaviour. Between the two preparation methods, only spray-drying was suitable for the microencapsulation of clonazepam in PLGA microspheres. In vitro dissolution tests highlight that more sustained release of drug is achieved with the higher (molecular weight) polymer.", 
    "70": "Considerable controversy exists regarding the practice of combining Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with Pharmacotherapy (PT) in the management of anxiety. This paper considers whether these two forms of treating anxiety disorders can be effectively combined to enhance treatment outcome. Despite the theoretical appeal of a combined approach, a critical review of treatment outcome findings across CBT and various anxiolytic medications and their combination, suggests a failure of these treatments to operate in a complementary fashion. A detrimental impact of anxiolytic medication on CBT outcome is particularly salient for high potency benzodiazepines. Low potency benzodiazepines and antidepressants generally have a negligible impact with no clear evidence of treatment enhancement and some negative combined treatment effects on medication withdrawal and at long-term follow-up. Thus, we address potential mechanisms that may explain this treatment noncomplementarity and in some cases, treatment incompatibility. Cognitive factors influencing treatment outcome (catastrophic beliefs, self-efficacy, selective attention, and memory) are highlighted in view of the empirically supported mediating role of these variables in accounting for treatment responsiveness. Potential effects of anxiolytic medication on cognitive change in CBT are postulated. A number of suggestions for future research and clinical practice are proposed on the basis of this review.", 
    "71": "Epileptic seizures are a known complication of uremia, but non-convulsive seizures appear to be rare. We describe a patient with absence status presenting with acute confusion who responded well to intravenous diazepam. Attention is drawn to this rare cause of acute confusional state in the hemodialysis population.", 
    "72": "In the present study, we have characterized properties of steroid withdrawal using a pseudopregnant rat model. This paradigm results in increased production of endogenous progesterone from ovarian sources and as such is a useful physiological model. \"Withdrawal\" from progesterone induced by ovariectomy on day 12 of pseudopregnancy resulted in increased anxiety, as determined by a decrease in open arm entries on the elevated plus maze compared to control rats and pseudopregnant animals not undergoing withdrawal. Similar findings were obtained 24 hr after administration of a 5alpha-reductase blocker to a pseudopregnant animal, suggesting that it is the GABAA-modulatory 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha, 5alpha-THP) that produces anxiogenic withdrawal symptoms. Twenty-four hours after steroid withdrawal, the time constant for decay of GABAA-gated current was also reduced sixfold, assessed using whole- cell patch-clamp procedures on pyramidal neurons acutely dissociated from CA1 hippocampus. Thus, 3alpha,5alpha-THP withdrawal results in a marked decrease in total GABAA current, a possible mechanism for its anxiogenic, proconvulsant sequelae. In addition, 3alpha,5alpha-THP withdrawal resulted in insensitivity to the normally potentiating effect of the benzodiazepine lorazepam (LZM) on GABAA-gated Cl- current. This withdrawal profile is similar to that reported for other GABAA-modulatory drugs such as the benzodiazepines (BDZs), barbiturates, and ethanol. These changes were also associated with significant two and threefold increases in both the mRNA and protein for the alpha4 subunit of the GABAA receptor, respectively, in hippocampus. The pseudopregnancy paradigm may be a useful model for periods of endogenous 3alpha,5alpha-THP withdrawal such as premenstrual syndrome and postpartum or postmenopausal dysphoria, when increased emotional lability and BDZ insensitivity have been reported.", 
    "73": "A group of 7,8-(methylenedioxy)-1-phenyl-3,5-dihydro-4H-2, 3-benzodiazepin-4-ones was synthesized and assayed for antagonism of rat brain alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The benzodiazepinones inhibited AMPA-activated membrane current responses in a manner consistent with noncompetitive, allosteric inhibition of the receptor-channel complex. The most potent compound in the series was 1-(4-aminophenyl)-7,8-(methylenedioxy)-3,5-dihydro-4H-2, 3-benzodiazepin-4-one (6), which had an IC50 of 2.7 microM. For comparison, the reference compound GYKI 52466 (2) had an IC50 of 6.9 microM. Compound 6 also had potent anticonvulsant activity in a mouse maximum electroshock-induced seizure (MES) assay: the ED50 was 2.8 mg/kg iv, whereas the ED50 for GYKI 52466 was 4.6 mg/kg iv. In contrast to a previous report, the 7,8-dimethoxy analogue of 6 was a low-potency AMPA antagonist (IC50 >100 microM) and weak anticonvulsant (ED50 >10 mg/kg iv). The benzodiazepinones described herein are potent noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists that could have therapeutic potential as anticonvulsants and neuroprotectants.", 
    "74": "A pharmacophore and an alignment rule have previously been reported for BzR agonist ligands. The design and synthesis of 6-(propyloxy)-4-(methoxymethyl)-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (6-PBC, 24, IC50 = 8.1 nM) was based on this pharmacophore. When evaluated in vivo this ligand exhibited anticonvulsant/anxiolytic activity but was devoid of the muscle relaxant/ataxic effects of \"classical\" 1,4-benzodiazepines (i.e., diazepam). Significantly, 6-PBC 24 also reversed diazepam-induced muscle relaxation in mice. The 3-substituted analogues 40-46 and 48 of 6-PBC 24 and Zk 93423 27(IC50 = 1 nM) were synthesized and evaluated in vitro to determine what affect these modifications would have on the binding affinity at recombinant BzR subtypes. With the exception of the 3-amino ligands 40 and 41, all the beta-carbolines were found to exhibit high binding affinity at BzR sites. The 3-propyl ether derivative 45 was also evaluated in vivo and found to be devoid of any proconvulsant or anticonvulsant activity at doses up to 40 mg/kg. The 6-(1-naphthylmethyloxy) and 6-octyloxy analogues 25, 26, 28, and 29 of 6-PBC 24 were synthesized to further evaluate the proposed alignment of agonists vs inverse agonists in the pharmacophore of the BzR. In addition, ligands 26 and 29 were designed to probe the dimensions of lipophilic pocket L3 at the agonist site. The activity of 29 was evaluated in vivo; however, this analogue elicited no pharmacological effects at doses up to 80 mg/kg. These and other related beta-carbolines were also examined in five recombinant GABAA receptor subtypes. Ligands 52-61 all exhibited moderate to high affinity at GABAA receptors containing alpha1 subunits. These ligands will be useful in further defining the pharmacophore at alpha1 beta3 gamma2 receptors.", 
    "75": "The hypersecretion of glucocorticoids during exposure to various stressors may induce or worsen pathological states in predisposed subjects. Therefore it is of interest to evaluate drugs able to reduce glucocorticoid secretion. It has recently been shown that chronic administration of a Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) inhibits stress-induced corticosterone hypersecretion through a reduction in the number of adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. The present study was designed to analyze the effect of EGb 761 and one of its components, Ginkgolide B on the biosynthesis and secretion of CRH and AVP, the hypothalamic neurohormones that regulate the pituitary-adrenal axis. Chronic administration of EGb 761 (50 or 100 mg/kg p.o. daily for 14 days) reduced basal corticosterone secretion and the subsequent increase in CRH and AVP gene expression. Under the same conditions, surgically-induced increase in CRH secretion was attenuated while the activation of CRH gene expression, ACTH and corticosterone secretion following insulin-induced hypoglycemia remained unchanged. Chronic i.p. injection of Ginkgolide B reduced basal corticosterone secretion without alteration in the subsequent CRH and AVP increase. However, the stimulation of CRH gene expression by insulin-induced hypoglycemia was attenuated by Ginkgolide B. These data confirm that the administration of EGb 761 and Ginkgolide B reduces corticosterone secretion. In addition, these substances act also at the hypothalamic level and are able to reduce CRH expression and secretion. However the latter effect appears to be complex and may depend upon both the nature of stress and substance (Ginkgolide B or other compounds of EGb 761).", 
    "76": "Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and synthetic steroids having anesthetic properties, by enhancing the inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission to the neuronal circuits of cerebral structures vulnerable to ischemia, reduce the damage induced by this condition. Some endogenous steroids resulting from progesterone (P4) biotransformation in the brain exert GABAergic effects, thus inhibiting neuronal excitability. Hence, P4 administration both before and after an experimentally induced ischemic episode may prevent or decrease the ischemic cerebral damage.",

After 14 days of survival, animals were sacrificed and the brains perfused in situ and formalin-fixed for histological examination.",

    "80": "Forty-two children (aged 2-16 years) were randomly assigned to receive either sevoflurane (n = 21) or halothane (n = 21) in nitrous oxide/oxygen. After pre-medication with midazolam, anaesthesia was induced by facemask and the anaesthetic concentration was increased until loss of eyelash reflex (sevoflurane, 6%; halothane, 2.5%). Thereafter, 1-1.5 MAC of the inhalational agents were maintained until skin closure. Intra-operative analgesia was provided either by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) bolus doses of fentanyl (2-3 micrograms kg-1) or by a regional blockade. Induction was smooth and the time to loss of eyelash reflex was slightly shorter with sevoflurane than with halothane, the difference not quite reaching statistical significance (P = 0.06). In both groups, heart rate remained stable and blood pressure decreased significantly during induction. Haemodynamic parameters remained stable during anaesthetic maintenance; no cardiac dysrhythmias were observed. Emergence time with sevoflurane was 12.9 min vs. 16.3 min with halothane, but this difference was not statistically significant. It is concluded that sevoflurane is as suitable for paediatric patients as halothane. The slightly faster emergence time offered by sevoflurane over halothane was of no clinical significance in the present study.", 
    "81": "We have studied the optimal diluent volume for post-operative analgesia and sedation produced by epidurally administered midazolam after upper abdominal surgery. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to four groups of 15 patients. When patients complained of pain after surgery, epidural midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 in 3 mL saline (Group A), in 5 mL saline (Group B), in 10 mL saline (Group C) or in 15 mL saline (Group D) were injected as a bolus. The sedation was better and lasted longer in groups B and C than in the other two groups. Groups B and C also had significantly more extensive areas of analgesia than groups A and D from 30 min after the administration of midazolam. The interval to the second request for an analgesic was significantly shorter in Group D than in the other three groups. Memory retention of the pin-prick examination was reported by four patients in Group A. The present results indicate that 5-10 mL saline is the optimal volume for epidural injection when using midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 for post-operative analgesia following upper abdominal surgery.", 
    "82": "Colonoscopy is routinely performed with conscious sedation. We wanted to determine if colonoscopy can be successfully completed without sedation and to assess patient tolerance and acceptance. One hundred nine consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy were examined. The risks and benefits of colonoscopy with or without sedation were explained in a standard format. Patients were then given the option of having colonoscopy without premedication. After the procedure, as well as 2 to 5 days later, patients rated on an analog scale (0, no pain; 5, severe) the severity of pain and willingness to undergo colonoscopy in the future without sedation. Eighty patients underwent colonoscopy without prior sedation. Only 6% (n=5) required sedation to complete the examination. When questioned, 5% experienced no pain, 41% slight or mild pain, 34% moderate pain, and 20% severe pain. Seventy-three percent (n=58) were willing to undergo repeat colonoscopy without sedation, 10% (n=8) were undecided, and 18% (n=14) would request sedation. Pain severity was a strong predictor (p=0.001) of future sedation preference. Colonoscopy without sedation may be completed successfully in most patients and does not undermine many patients' willingness to undergo a similar procedure in the future. Sedation by choice is more cost-effective, may be safer, and should be offered as an alternative to routine intravenous sedation.", 
    "83": "Rapid urease tests are used for quick identification of Helicobacter pylori during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Rapid urease test solutions contain urea, which in the presence of H. pylori urease, generates ammonia, which changes the test medium color to indicate a positive result. Theoretically, Xylocaine spray (ASTRA, S\u00f6dertalje, Sweden), which has a basic pH value, could cause a similar positive reaction in the test medium. To determine whether patients premedicated with Xylocaine spray have a higher rate of false positive urease tests, we compared the results of a rapid urease test and histologic stains in 107 patients, 54 premedicated with Xylocaine spray and 53 premedicated with intravenous midazolam but not Xylocaine spray. There were no significant differences in test sensitivity, specificity, or predictive values between the study groups. We conclude that patients can be premedicated with Xylocaine spray without concern that the false positive rate of rapid urease tests will increase.", 
    "84": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been implicated in various neuronal functions, including synaptic plasticity. To examine the physiological regulation of its activated, autophosphorylated state in relation to acute neuronal excitation in vivo, we studied the effect of electroconvulsive treatment in rats on CaMKII activity and in situ autophosphorylation levels. As early as 30 s after the electrical stimulation, a profound but transient decrease in its Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity, as well as in the level of its autophosphorylation at Thr286(alpha)/Thr287(beta) measured by using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies, was observed in homogenate from hippocampus and parietal cortex, which was reversible in 5 min. In the later time course, a moderate, reversible increase, which peaked at around 60 min after the electrical stimulation, was observed in parietal cortex but not in hippocampus. The early-phase decrease was found to occur exclusively in the soluble fraction. In addition, partial translocation of CaMKII from the soluble to the particulate fraction seems to have occurred in this early phase. Thus, the activated, autophosphorylated state of CaMKII is under dynamic and precise regulation in vivo, and its regulatory mechanisms seem to have regional specificity.", 
    "85": "A new AMPA receptor antagonist, Ro 48-8587, was characterized pharmacologically in vitro. It is highly potent and selective for AMPA receptors as shown by its effects on [3H]AMPA, [3H] kainate, and [3H] MK-801 binding to rat brain membranes and on AMPA- or NMDA-induced depolarization in rat cortical wedges. [3H]Ro 48-8587 bound with a high affinity (KD = 3 nM) to a single population of binding sites with a Bmax of 1 pmol/mg of protein in rat whole brain membranes. [3H]Ro 48-8587 binding to rat whole brain membranes was inhibited by several compounds with the following rank order of potency: Ro 48-8587 > 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f] quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) > YM 90K > 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) > quisqualate > AMPA > glutamate > kainate > NMDA. The distribution and abundance of specific binding sites (approximately 95% of total) in sections of rat CNS, revealed by quantitative receptor radioautography and image analysis, indicated a very discrete localization. Highest binding values were observed in cortical layers (binding in layers 1 and 2 > binding in layers 3-6), hippocampal formation, striatum, dorsal septum, reticular thalamic nucleus, cerebellar molecular layer, and spinal cord dorsal horn. At 1 nM, the values for specific binding were highest in the cortical layers 1 and 2 and lowest in the brainstem (approximately 2.6 and 0.4 pmol/mg of protein, respectively). Ro 48-8587 is a potent and selective AMPA receptor antagonist with improved binding characteristics (higher affinity, selectivity, and specific binding) compared with those previously reported.", 
    "86": "Our objective was to examine the performance of sublingual administration of the short- to intermediate-acting benzodiazepine flunitrazepam on patients with dental anxiety. The study was designed as a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial with nearly identical dental interventions performed on two separate occasions in 24 adult patients. Flunitrazepam (1 mg) significantly reduced anxiety and was well tolerated. With few exceptions, both the patients and the dentist clearly favored the session with flunitrazepam. Most patients also preferred the remaining part of the day when they had been premedicated with flunitrazepam. They were apparently not particularly troubled by being somewhat drowsy. Dizziness was not reported as a problem. Flunitrazepam appears to be an effective, safe, and recommendable alternative for premedication of anxious dental patients.", 
    "87": "This study was performed to evaluate the effect of midazolam, as premedication before intravenous conscious sedation, on preprocedural, procedural, and post-procedural patient comfort and anxiety in children undergoing endoscopy.", 
    "88": "A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in 123 children (age 7.75 +/- 4.46 years, 56% male) using oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg, maximum 20 mg) as a premedication before insertion of an intravenous access device (i.v.) and upper endoscopy. Patients were evaluated with regard to changes in vital signs, level of sedation during i.v. placement, level of pre- and post-procedure conscious sedation, ease of separation from parents, ease and duration of procedure, recovery time, and amnesia to objects shown before i.v. placement and immediately before the start of the procedure.", 
    "89": "A significant difference was noted in the study group for the following parameters: level of sedation for i.v. placement (p < 0.0001), pre-procedural sedation (p < 0.001), ease of i.v. insertion (p < 0.003), ease of separation from parents (p = 0.022), and ease of the nursing personnel's ability to monitor the patient during the procedure (p = 0.0012). The patient's amnesia to an object shown immediately before beginning the endoscopy was increased (p < 0.001). Patients and parents were also more satisfied with the procedure process (p < 0.05). No significant difference was noted with regard to the length or performance of the procedure or recovery time or in the dose of i.v. medication required for successful completion of the endoscopy.", 
    "90": "Oral midazolam is an effective and safe premedication for children undergoing upper endoscopy and should be used in all anxious children and in patients previously judged to be difficult to sedate.", 
    "91": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD) share several clinical features, and theory postulates that phasic arousal is similarly dysregulated in both. The modulation of phasic arousal can be probed by measuring the effect of pharmacologic agents on auditory startle.", 
    "92": "Eyeblink electromyogram, heart rate, and skin conductance (SC) responses to 15 consecutive presentations of 1000-Hz, 95-dB, zero rise-time pure tones were measured, before and during treatment with alprazolam, in 9 PTSD and 9 PD patients. Concurrent anxiety was assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale.", 
    "93": "The groups did not differ in initial psychometric and physiological measures. Significant decrease in anxiety was observed in both groups during treatment. A decrease in response probability and a decrease in the SC responses were observed in PD, but not in PTSD.", 
    "94": "The results may reflect a difference in the modulation of phasic arousal between the disorders. They may also express an impaired between-session habituation or contextual sensitization in PTSD.", 
    "95": "It commonly is observed that focal hand dystonias, such as writer's cramp or musician's cramp, are associated with repetitive movements, although definitive proof of a causal relationship is lacking. These focal dystonias are often task specific, with involuntary muscle contractions occurring only when patients perform specific acts such as writing or playing a musical instrument. Physiologic studies show deficiencies in spinal reciprocal inhibition and abnormalities of central sensory processing and motor output that may be related to reduced cortical inhibition. Recent studies in primates support the notion that repetitive motions can induce plasticity changes in the sensory cortex leading to degradation of topographic representations of the hand, and raise the possibility that sensory training may be beneficial. Current treatment options for focal dystonia include botulinum toxin injections, anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and occupational therapy.", 
    "96": "To compare the efficacy and side effects of midazolam and ketamine administered nasally for pediatric premedication.", 
    "97": "In this double blind trial 60 children scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned to two groups to receive 0.25 mg.kg or 5 mg.kg nasal ketamine. We measured level of acceptance of medication, sedation, hemodynamic variables, reaction to separation from parents, side effects and time until recovery from anesthesia.", 
    "98": "The two groups were homogeneous. Acceptance of medication was good or adequate in all patients. The level of sedation was significant in both groups 10 min after premedication. Systolic arterial pressure was higher in the ketamine group 20 min after administration of the drug and upon arrival in the operating theater. Reaction to separation from parents was good in all groups. Secretions were higher in the ketamine group and hallucinations were experienced by three patients in the ketamine group and by two in the midazolam group. We found no difference in time until spontaneous eye opening after surgery. No complications were observed.", 
    "99": "The nasal route is adequately accepted by children. Both drugs are effective by this route and sedation is rapid. Time until postanesthetic recovery is similar with both drugs. The doses used have wide safety margins.", 
    "100": "The general pharmacological profile and effects of E-4716 on the CNS have been investigated in comparison with other histamine receptor blockers. In in vitro studies with isolated organs and in binding studies on numerous receptors, E-4716 had no activity even at high concentrations, except for the selective blockade of H1 receptors. No activity was observed in pharmacological trials in vivo, such as the Irwin test or analgesia induced by phenylbenzoquinone or electroshock, suggesting a depressant activity on the CNS. In tests potentiating hypnosis induced by barbiturates, benzodiazepines and ethanol in mice, E-4716 always showed milder potentiating effects than the other reference drugs. In monkeys, no sedating effects were observed at 200 mg/kg, p.o. These results suggest that E-4716 exhibits good clinical efficacy without any secondary effects.", 
    "101": "The stability of cardiodynamic and some blood parameters during a slow, continuous infusion of a combination of ketamine and diazepam is reported. Contractility (dP/dt), myocardial relaxation (Tln), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), arterial blood pressure and certain blood parameters were assessed in 3 male and 3 female juvenile baboons (Papio ursinus). Anaesthesia was induced with 15 mg/kg ketamine i.m. and maintained with a continuous i.v. infusion (40-60 ml/h) of ketamine and diazepam. The mixture consisted of 2 ml ketamine (100 mg/ml), 2 ml diazepam (5 mg/ml) and 50 ml saline. A period of 75 +/- 10 min was allowed for preparation of the animals, after which lead II of the ECG, femoral artery blood pressure and left ventricular pressure were recorded at 15-min intervals for a period of 2 h: the total duration of anaesthesia was 195 min. Arterial blood samples were analysed at 30-min intervals for blood gases, electrolytes, glucose and insulin. Left ventricular parameters were derived from the left ventricular pressure curve. Tln, LVSP and LVEDP showed small fluctuations. Contractility decreased (p < 0.037) at the 195-min interval. No arrhythmias or ECG changes were seen, while blood pressure decreased gradually. Serum calcium concentration decreased and blood glucose levels increased gradually over time. Anaesthesia and analgesia were sufficient and no other drugs were necessary. The animals appeared sedated and dazed 60-80 min after the procedure. A continuous infusion of a combination of ketamine and diazepam for a duration of 150 min can provide stable anaesthesia for cardiodynamic measurements.", 
    "102": "In a case where a 32-year-old man lost control of his vehicle, urine and blood samples were taken 6 h after the crash for toxicological investigations. In the hospital, the driver admitted consumption of some drugs, in particular digoxin and midazolam just before the crash which corresponded to the results of blood analyses. Toxicological findings indicated the presence of digoxin at 12.9 ng/ml and midazolam at 7 ng/ml in the blood. These results suggested that at the moment of the crash digoxin and midazolam blood levels were in the range of toxic and therapeutic concentrations, respectively. Therefore the respective roles of the drugs in the impairment of the ability to drive at the moment of the crash is discussed.", 
    "103": "We investigated the effects of the novel CCKB/gastrin antagonist YM022 on gastric acid secretion in vivo and in vitro, compared to CI-988 and L365,260 as reference antagonists. In the anaesthetized rat, pentagastrin-induced stimulation of gastric acid secretion was dose-dependently and up to 100% inhibited by i.v. administration of YM022 with an ID50 of 0.009 +/- 0.0006 mumol/kg h in comparison to 0.6 +/- 0.03 and 3.40 +/- 0.05 mumol/kg h for CI-988 and L-365,260, respectively. In the gastric fistula cat, i.v. administration of YM022 produced a similar inhibitory effect with an ID50 of 0.02 mumol/kg in comparison to 1.6 and 2.5 mumol/kg for CI-988 and L-365,260, respectively. Furthermore, bolus injection of 0.6 mumol/kg YM022 produced 100% inhibition within 30 min and 85% inhibition was still observed after 3 h. In the isolated rabbit gastric glands, CCK8-stimulated 14C-aminopyrine uptake was inhibited according to the following rank order of potency: YM022 (IC50 = 0.0012 microM) > > CI-988 (IC50 = 0.2 microM) > > L365,260 (IC50 = 2.8 microM). Unlike with L365,260, no influence of CI-988 and YM022 on histamine-stimulated acid output was shown in this study. Thus, YM022 is a highly potent and selective gastric CCKB/gastrin receptor antagonist and has a long-lasting inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion.", 
    "104": "Women are prescribed benzodiazepines twice as frequently as men and there is evidence of differences in therapeutic responsiveness to benzodiazepines between genders. In this study we compared the regional brain metabolic response to benzodiazepines between male and female subjects. Sixteen healthy men and 12 healthy women were scanned with positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) twice: prior to placebo and prior to lorazepam (30 microg/kg) on separate days. Lorazepam significantly and consistently decreased whole brain metabolism and the magnitude as well as the regional pattern of the changes was comparable for both genders (M = -4.7+/- 3 and F = -3.9 +/- 3.8 micromol/100 g/min). Lorazepam effects were largest in thalamus (- 12.5 +/- 6.2 and -8.6 +/- 7.1 micromol/100 g/min) and occipital cortex (-10.5 +/- 5.5 and -10.1 +/- 6.6 micromol/100 g/min). Lorazepam-induced changes in 'relative' metabolism were also similar for both genders except for trend differences (0.01 < P < 0.05) in rectal gyrus, where lorazepam increased relative metabolism in women (+4.4 +/- 9.9%) whereas it decreased in men (-3.2 +/- 8.8%, P < 0.04) and in cerebellum, where lorazepam-induced decrements were larger in women (-5.9 +/- 6%) than in men (-1.1% +/- 6.6%, P < 0.05). There were no differences between genders for any of the behavioral effects of lorazepam. In summary, this study does not show differences in the response to lorazepam between the genders as assessed by its behavioral effects and the changes in absolute metabolism; the trend toward a difference in the relative changes in rectal gyrus and cerebellum merits further investigation.", 
    "105": "We present a case of a patient showing a cutaneous and systemic affectation compatible with the Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to the intake of tetrazepam as a muscular relaxant. The symptoms remitted after the suspension of the involved medicines and after treatment with systemic corticoids. Months later, a study with patch tests, with the standard battery and the medicines that she took (indapamide, tetrazepam, acetyl salicylic acid, botriozolam and levomepromazine) was carried out. She presented positivity to tetrazepam at 48 and 96 hours. The oral provocations with the other medicines, which she consumed, were negative. The study of cross reactivity with other benzodiazepines was negative. In the medical literature, different cutaneous affectations regarding benzodiazepine use (generalised drug eruptions, contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, ...) have been described byt non Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The patch tests are useful in the diagnosis of this type of cutaneous reactions, avoiding in this way the achievement of oral provocations, with the potential risk for the patient that they imply. The absence of cross-reactions with other substances of the same group has to be pointed out, even with those with which keeps great structural similarity as the diazepam. In spite of the absence of cross reactions with the rest of benzodiazepines, faced with the seriousness of the case presented, it is advised to the patient to avoid this type of medicines.", 
    "106": "It was shown that the increased brain seizure readiness persisted within 6 months after termination of corazol kindling. Seizures of the same severity as during kindling (corazol injection in a dose of 20 mg/kg) were reproduced by corazol injection in a dose of 30 mg/kg. In contrast to the control rats, in this situation an autoenhancement of seizures was observed in the kindled animals. Acute corazol seizures induced a decrease in Bmax and Kd of 3H-diazepam binding with benzodiazepine receptors (BDR) in the cerebellum of the 10-months-old control rats white the young animals demonstrated only a decrease in Bmax of binding. In 6 months after kindling termination the BDR activity (Bmax) was reduced by one half. However, we think that the increase in Bmax is not responsible for persistence of the increased seizure readiness. It seems possible that down regulation of receptor activity develops independently of kindling but in response to long-lasting corazol application. Probably, Bmax spontaneously decreases after the termination of the long-term corazol application. The single dose of corazol (30 mg/kg) restores the changes in BDR density to the level when seizure readiness has been just fixed (6 months after kindling termination), independently of the primary receptor density.", 
    "107": "1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TRI) is a commonly used industrial solvent with a considerable potential for inhalation abuse. Previous studies in our laboratory and elsewhere have shown that this agent exerts a suppressant effect on operant responding, as well as a number of additional neurobehavioral effects that are similar to those of central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs. In an effort to provide information relevant to potential mechanisms involved in the behavioral effects and abuse potential of TRI, the present study evaluated the acute effects of this agent on the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis . Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 3500 or 5000 ppm TRI by inhalation for 10 or 30 min. Following exposure, plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone and levels of ACTH and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in three brain regions--hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex--were determined by selective radioimmunoassays. Levels of TRI in the three brain regions as well as blood were measured by headspace gas chromatography to determine the target tissue concentrations responsible for neuroendocrine changes. Uptake of TRI in blood and all brain regions was very rapid, with stable concentrations apparently achieved within 10 min and maintained for 30 min. During this time course, a significant decrease in plasma corticosterone was produced at 30 min but no significant change in plasma ACTH was observed with 3500 ppm TRI. However, after exposure to 5000 ppm, both plasma ACTH and plasma corticosterone were significantly reduced at 10 and 30 min. ACTH levels in the three brain regions were not significantly changed by TRI, while hypothalamic CRF was significantly increased during exposure to 3500 ppm. However, hypothalamic concentrations of CRF declined following 30 min at 3500 ppm and were not significantly changed by 5000 ppm. This complexity of effects on the regulation of HPA axis activity likely precluded the establishment of consistent relationships between changes in hormonal levels and blood or regional brain concentrations of the inhalant. However, these actions of TRI were strikingly similar to those previously reported for the benzodiazepines.", 
    "108": "A treatment algorithm for anxiety disorders in primary care practice is introduced. Anxiety is understood as a complex pattern which consists of thoughts, emotions, behaviour and physiologic reactions. Patient education is outlined as a crucial factor for the management of anxiety. Some examples of patient education are given. The most important pharmacological agents for the treatment of anxiety are benzodiazepines, antidepressants and buspirone. The drug treatment of some common anxiety disorders is presented. Finally the limits of anxiety management in primary care are discussed and some techniques of cognitive behaviour therapy are outlined.", 
    "109": "We recorded all-night polysomnograms of four schizophrenic patients with neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) before and during treatment with clonazepam. Also, four non-akathitic schizophrenic patients were recorded all-night polysomnograms as control subjects. Daily treatment with 1.5 to 3 mg clonazepam improved subjective complaints of all the 4 patients with NIA. Three of 4 patients with NIA exhibited periodic limb movements (PLM) on bilateral legs, but none of 4 control subjects showed PLM. Total number of PLM and PLM per hour decreased during clonazepam treatment. Moreover, mean inter-movement intervals of PLM of 3 patients were prolonged on bilateral legs. NIA might change its feature as PLM during night sleep.", 
    "110": "Excitatory amino acids participate in the generation of seizure activity. Consequently, the effects of GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methoxy-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride], an antagonist of glutamate-mediated events, on the protective activity of conventional antiepileptic drugs against pentetrazol were studied. GYKI 52466 (up to 10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect the clonic phase of pentetrazol (injected s.c. at its CD97 of 90 mg/kg) convulsions. Only the antipentetrazol activity of valproate (100 mg/kg) was enhanced by GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg)--the percentage of mice protected was significantly increased from 20 to 90%. The anticonvulsive activity of clonazepam (at 0.01), ethosuximide (at 50), and phenobarbital (at 2.5 mg/kg) was not modified by GYKI 52466 (up to 10 mg/kg). The combination of valproate (100 mg/kg) with GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg) did not affect the performance of mice evaluated in the chimney test. However, this combination resulted in significant memory deficits, measured in the passive avoidance task. In no case did GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg) affect either total or free plasma levels of antiepileptic drugs (as measured by immunofluorescence), so a pharmacokinetic interaction is not probable. Finally, the interaction of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist with antiepileptic drugs does not seem promising in the pentetrazol test, recognized as a model of human myoclonic epilepsy.", 
    "111": "The administration of anxiolytic drugs often accompanies treatment with antidepressant medications. Although benzodiazepines help alleviate the secondary depressive symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbance, they do not actually enhance antidepressant response. On the other hand, the anxiolytic agent buspirone does facilitate direct antidepressant response, largely through its ability to activate both presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors and thus modulate serotonin release. Several case studies and open-label trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of buspirone as an augmentation agent. Because buspirone is also associated with few adverse effects, it appears to be both effective and safe in the augmentation of antidepressant pharmacotherapy.", 
    "112": "Hexarelin (HEX) is a synthetic GHRP which acts on specific receptors at both the pituitary and the hypothalamic level to stimulate GH release both in animals and in humans. Like other GHRPs, HEX possesses also acute ACTH and cortisol-releasing activity similar to that of hCRH. The mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effect of GHRPs on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are still unclear, although a CNS-mediated action has been demonstrated. In 6 normal healthy young women (26-34 years) we studied the effects on ACTH and cortisol secretion of HEX (2.0 microg/kg i.v. at 0 min) alone and preceded by dexamethasone (DEXA, 1 mg p.o. at 23.00 h on the previous night) or alprazolam (ALP, 0.02 mg/kg p.o. at -90 min), a benzodiazepine which binds to GABA receptors and possesses CRH-mediated inhibitory activity on HPA axis. ACTH and cortisol secretion after saline administration as well as the GH response to HEX alone and preceded by DEXA or ALP were also studied. HEX administration elicited an increase in ACTH (peak vs. baseline, mean +/- SEM: 28.0 +/- 6.7 vs. 11.7 +/- 2.2 pg/ml, p < 0.05) and cortisol secretion (162.6 +/- 15.0 vs. 137.7 +/- 12.6 microg/l, p < 0.05). DEXA pretreatment strongly inhibited basal ACTH (3.2 +/- 0.7 pg/ml, p < 0.01) and cortisol levels (11.3 +/- 2.5 microg/l, p < 0.001) and abolished the ACTH and cortisol responses to HEX (3.6 +/- 0.9 pg/ml, p < 0.01 and 10.7 +/- 2.0 microg/l, p < 0.001), respectively. On the other hand, ALP pretreatment did not significantly modify basal ACTH (7.9 +/- 2.0 pg/ml) and cortisol levels (127.6 +/- 14.5 microg/l) but abolished the HEX-induced ACTH and cortisol secretions (8.6 +/- 2.4 pg/ml, p < 0.05 and 111.0 +/- 6.0 microg/l, p < 0.05), respectively. ACTH and cortisol levels after HEX when preceded by ALP overlapped with those recorded during saline. HEX induced a clear GH response (peak at 15 min vs. baseline: 65.5 +/- 20.5 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.7 microg/l, p < 0.03) which was blunted by ALP (peak at 15 min: 21.5 +/- 5.5 microg/l, p < 0.05) while it was not modified by DEXA pretreatment (78.7 +/- 7.6 microg/l). In conclusion, our present data demonstrate that the ACTH- and cortisol-releasing effect of HEX is abolished by either dexamethasone or alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, which is even able to blunt the GH-releasing activity of the hexapeptide. These findings suggest that, in physiological conditions, the stimulatory effect of GHRPs on HPA axis is sensitive to the negative glucocorticoid feedback and could be mediated by GABAergic mechanisms; the latter seem also involved in the GH-releasing activity of GHRPs.", 
    "113": "This study examined the use patterns and efficacy of the high potency benzodiazepine (HPB) clonazepam in panic patients who were treated and followed naturalistically in the Massachusetts General Hospital Longitudinal Study of Panic Disorder. Of 204 patients followed over a 2-year period, 46 percent were receiving clonazepam alone or in combination with an antidepressant. Treatment was not controlled at initial evaluation or during the followup period. The main variables assessed in this analysis included global severity of the panic disorder and stability of clonazepam dose. All treatment groups tended to improve over time without significant differences in outcome between groups. Clonazepam doses remained stable over time. Results of this study suggest that treatment of panic disorder with the HPB clonazepam achieved and maintained a therapeutic benefit similar to that obtained with alternative pharmacologic treatments, without the development of tolerance as manifested by dose escalation or worsening of clinical status.", 
    "114": "The present study is to clarify whether the bias and limits of agreement of the TOF-Guard and the mechanomyograph differ from those of two mechanomyographs on contra lateral arms. Previous studies of the bias and limits of agreement between acceleromyographical (TOF-Guard) and mechanomyographical measurements of neuromuscular transmission did not take the error introduced by using contra lateral arms into consideration.", 
    "115": "Fifty-two women undergoing gynecological surgery were anesthetized with midazolam, fentanyl, thiopental, halothane and nitrous oxide. Neuromuscular blockade was induced and maintained with atracurium. In 32 patients, neuromuscular monitoring was performed with a Myograph 2000 on one hand and a TOF-Guard at the other (M/T group). In 20 patients, monitoring was performed with a Myograph 2000 at both hands (M/M group). Train-of-four stimulations were applied to the ulnar nerve at the wrist in both groups. Bias and limits of agreement between the contra lateral hands in each group were calculated as proposed by Bland and Altman.", 
    "116": "When the TOF ratio was 0.25, TOF ratio bias and limits of agreement in the M/T group were 0.86 and 17.58 to -15.85, respectively. Corresponding values in the M/M group were -1.75 and 12.3 to -8.8. Bias in the M/T group decreased significantly to -8.1 when TOF ratio increased to 0.70, resulting in limits of agreement of 12.1 to -28.4. The corresponding values in the M/M group were bias 2.0 and limits of agreement 10.7 to -6.7. TOF-Guard bias for onset time and time to 5% recovery of T1 (first twitch in TOF) were -19s and -1.5 min, respectively; both values differed significantly from zero (P < 0.05). Taken together with the changing TOF-ratio bias during recovery in the M/T group, these results indicate different onset and recovery curves for the two monitoring devices.", 
    "117": "Due to wide limits of agreement and different recovery courses, acccleromyographic and mechanomyographic recordings of neuromuscular transmission cannot be used interchangeably. The substantial variation between simultaneous mechanomyographical recordings of neuromuscular transmission obtained in contra lateral arms suggests that this factor should be taken into account when studying new neuromuscular monitoring techniques using the two-arm technique.", 
    "118": "Potential pharmacokinetic effects of venlafaxine on alprazolam, a substrate of the cytochrome pigment 450 (CYP) isoenzyme CYP3A4, were investigated in 16 healthy volunteers. A single 2-mg oral dose of alprazolam was combined with steady-state levels of venlafaxine administered orally at 75 mg twice daily. The levels of alprazolam in plasma and of alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, and 4-hydroxyalprazolam in urine were determined. Steady-state venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine concentrations in plasma were reached before venlafaxine was coadministered with alprazolam. Coadministering venlafaxine increased the apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of alprazolam by 36 percent and 9 percent, respectively, and decreased the alprazolam area under the concentration-time curve and half-life by 29 percent and 21 percent, respectively. There were small but statistically significant increases in mean baseline scores for the digit-symbol substitution and symbol copying tests, probably reflecting a time-dependent learning effect. The maximum score decrease from baseline for these two tests also increased, possibly representing an additive effect of alprazolam and venlafaxine. Overall, venlafaxine did not inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of alprazolam in vivo, which corroborates other in vitro and in vivo data showing a lack of CYP3A4 inhibition with venlafaxine.", 
    "119": "Alprazolam was the first pharmacological agent to be approved for the treatment of panic disorder. In seeking that approval, the Upjohn Company conducted the earliest large, multicenter drug trials in panic disorder, involving nearly 1,700 patients in 14 countries. The administrative and quality assurance procedures developed for those studies have become a model for subsequent research. Despite this history, the efficacy of alprazolam for panic disorder has been contested. This article summarizes the published multicenter data from the perspective of the assessment criteria recommended by Shear and Maser (1994) and presents comparative findings from the Philadelphia maintenance study and the London/Toronto study of alprazolam and exposure therapy. Data on relapse following treatment discontinuation are also reviewed.", 
    "120": "Clonazepam has recently been approved for the treatment of panic disorder. Two large placebo-controlled efficacy trials were completed; superior benefit was found for the drug on most measures. The studies are reviewed in relation to the criteria set forth by Shear and Maser with respect to design, diagnostic, and outcome measures. Most, but not all, recommended measures were used. Measurement of panic attack severity, duration, and frequency were generally the least satisfactory of all outcome variables and failed to provide the consistent benefit that was found with other measures. A slow discontinuation phase was employed, and a benign withdrawal course was noted, although withdrawal from higher doses was associated with more emergent symptomatology.", 
    "121": "We examined the acute performance and sedative effects of single high and low doses of alprazolam and lorazepam, both before and after chronic, 3-week b.i.d. treatment in elderly adults. The effects of chronic treatment also were examined in this parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Initial acute low doses significantly impaired total recall and increased intrusion errors. High doses also impaired delayed recall and critical flicker fusion threshold (CFF). Only chronic treatment with high-dose alprazolam increased intrusions and self-rated sedation. Single-dose rechallenge after chronic treatment was associated with significantly less impairment than the initial challenge in memory tasks but not in the discriminant reaction time (DRAT) task. For most memory measures, the development of tolerance was only partial; rechallenge still produced significant deficits in relation to placebo. The development of tolerance was task-specific and depended on drug type and dosage. Despite impairments in various memory functions, CFF, and DRAT, volunteers did not report significant drug-induced changes in sedation.", 
    "122": "The article consists in a review of the clinical evidence for treating anxiety disorders with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Sufficient documentation now exists to support the use of SSRIs in treating panic and obsessive-compulsive disorders, and in Sweden moclobemide is now approved for use in treating social phobia, and buspirone for use in treating generalised anxiety disorder. Further documentation of the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder with SSRIs is probably to be expected. Benzodiazepines remain the most commonly used anxiolytics. Although persistent adverse sexual reactions, and withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt termination of medication, are notable side effects of SSRIs, patients become measurably more self-confident and focused, and manage risks more adequately. This underscores the need of further research into the interrelationship of personality traits and anxiety symptoms.", 
    "123": "The authors hoped to reduce the need for preoperative sedation and intravenous pain medication during cataract surgery by converting from peribulbar anesthesia to sub-Tenon's anesthesia.", 
    "124": "A consecutive series of 2453 cataract patients' charts were reviewed. Each patient had previously watched a videotape explaining the anesthetic method to be used. Requests for preoperative sedation were compared between patients who received peribulbar or sub-Tenon's anesthesia. A sample of 200 charts of nonsedated patients were reviewed to compare intraoperative pain and motility.", 
    "125": "Intraoperative freedom from pain was reported by 91% of the peribulbar patients and 99% of the sub-Tenon's patients. Preoperative sedation was reduced from 26% of the peribulbar patients to 6.7% of the sub-Tenon's patients.", 
    "126": "Sub-Tenon's anesthesia provided excellent intraoperative pain relief and reduced the need for preoperative sedation, making it a satisfactory anesthetic technique for patients undergoing cataract phacoemulsification in an ambulatory surgery facility.", 
    "127": "To compile and evaluate all available data suggesting an association between selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration and the occurrence of movement disorders, and to characterize these reactions in terms of onset, duration, treatment and outcome, and potential predisposing factors.", 
    "128": "Reports of movement disorders were identified by conducting a comprehensive literature search that included tertiary adverse drug reaction resources, MEDLINE, EmBASE, Biological Abstracts, Current Contents, Reactions, ClinAlert, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. In addition, reports were solicited from the Canadian proprietary manufacturers of SSRIs, and from the Therapeutic Products Program of Health Canada. Each case was then classified according to the description of the movement disorder, based on predefined diagnostic criteria.", 
    "129": "A total of 127 published reports of SSRI-induced movement disorders were identified involving akathisia (n = 30), dystonia (19), dyskinesia (12), tardive dyskinesia (6), parkinsonism (25), and 15 cases of mixed disorders. Ten isolated cases of bruxism were identified. Ten additional reports could not be classified. Manufacturers of SSRIs provided 49 reports of akathisia, 44 of dystonia, 208 of dyskinesia, 76 of tardive dyskinesia, 516 of parkinsonism, and 60 of bruxism. Treatment strategies included discontinuation of the SSRI; dosage reduction; or the addition of a benzodiazepine, beta-blocker, or anticholinergic agent.", 
    "130": "SSRI use appears to be associated with the development of movement disorders, as either a direct result of the drug or exacerbation of an underlying condition. Predisposing factors may include the use of neuroleptics, existing neurologic diagnoses, or preexisting movement disorders. Clinicians should be cognizant of the potential for these reactions, as prompt recognition and management is essential in preventing potentially significant patient morbidity.", 
    "131": "To review the epidemiology, etiology, and classification of insomnia and provide an overview of the pharmacologic therapy of insomnia. Novel nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics including zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon, as well as nonprescription products such as valerian and melatonin, are reviewed in detail.", 
    "132": "A MEDLINE search was performed to identify relevant clinical studies, case reports, abstracts, and review articles published between April 1992 and December 1997. Key search terms included insomnia, benzodiazepines, zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon, Cl 284,846, melatonin, and valerian. Additional references were obtained from the lists of review articles and textbooks.", 
    "133": "Data concerning the safety and efficacy of the hypnotic agents were extracted from all available clinical trials and abstracts. Background information regarding insomnia, benzodiazepines, and other hypnotics was extracted from the most current literature, including review articles and textbooks.", 
    "134": "New developments in benzodiazepine receptor pharmacology have introduced novel nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics that provide comparable efficacy to benzodiazepines. Although they may possess theoretical advantages over benzodiazepines based on their unique pharmacologic profiles, they offer few, if any, significant advantages in terms of adverse effects. Over-the-counter agents such as valerian and melatonin may be useful in alleviating mild, short-term insomnia, but further clinical trials are required to fully evaluate their safety and efficacy.", 
    "135": "We investigated the effect of nitrazepam on nocturnal scratching in 10 adult out-patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover method. Patients were given either nitrazepam (Benzalin tablets containing 5 mg nitrazepam) or a placebo on 3 successive nights, with a washout interval of 4 days. We used an infrared video camera to identify bouts of scratching lasting more than 5 s. These were counted and the duration of all the bouts of scratching (total scratching time, TST) was calculated. The percentage of TST to total recording time (TST%) was used as an index of nocturnal scratching. The frequency with which bouts of scratching (bouts/h) occurred was reduced by 10 mg nitrazepam (7.7 +/- 3.6 with nitrazepam vs. 9.6 +/- 3.6 with placebo, P < 0.05). However, the mean duration (s/bout) of the bouts of scratching was longer with 10 mg nitrazepam (32.3 +/- 23.4 with nitrazepam vs. 19.1 +/- 10.0 with placebo, P < 0.05). As a result, there was no significant difference between TST% (6.5 +/- 4.2 with nitrazepam vs. 5.4 +/- 3.8 with placebo, not significant). All the above values are mean +/- SD. The degree of itching and the condition of the AD did not change during the 2 weeks of the study. We conclude that taking 10 mg nitrazepam is not an effective way of reducing the total duration of nocturnal scratching in AD patients, although it decreases the frequency with which bouts of nocturnal scratching occur.", 
    "136": "The effects of pre-anaesthetic medication on target propofol concentration, induction dose, time to induction, and discomfort on infusion were studied in 45 female patients undergoing ambulatory gynaecological procedures using 'Diprifusor' target controlled infusion of propofol. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either no premedication (group 1) or premedication with diazepam alone (group 2) or in combination with alfentanil (group 3). Induction was more successful in premedicated than unpremedicated patients with an initial target propofol concentration of 4 micrograms.ml-1 (87% in group 2 and 93% in group 3 vs. 38% in group 1, p < 0.01). Premedication was also associated with the requirement of a lower mean target concentration for induction, a lower induction dose and a shorter time to induction. There were no significant between-group differences in discomfort on infusion or target concentration during maintenance. For short ambulatory procedures, the recommended initial target concentration of propofol is 4 micrograms.ml-1 in premedicated and 6 micrograms.ml-1 in unpremedicated patients.", 
    "137": "Combinations of various psychotropic drugs are often used, sometimes for long periods, in the treatment of various forms of psychiatric disorders. This paper evaluates the cytogenetic consequences of daily exposure to polytherapy with antianxiety, antipsychotic and antimaniacal drugs by determining chromosomal aberrations (CA) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in peripheral blood samples. The study was performed with a group of 36 psychiatric patients: 18 receiving long-term treatment with lithium carbonate, combined with benzodiazepines (BD) and antipsychotic agents (Group A) and 18 treated with BD and antipsychotics (Group B). Among the latter, 7 patients had only been treated for 1 month (Group B1). The results reveal a significant increase (p<0.01) in cells with aberrations in the two groups of patients (A,B) compared to controls. Moreover, complex aberrations (dicentrics, rearrangements, chromatid exchanges) had a frequency of 0.63% in patients receiving long-term treatment compared to 0.11% in controls, corresponding to the general spontaneous rate. The mean frequency of SCE/cell and the percentage of cells with a high frequency of exchanges (HFC) also showed a highly significant difference compared to controls in both Group A and Group B. Group B1 (patients who only commenced treatment 1 month earlier) did not differ from the control group with regard to the frequency and type of chromosomal aberration or in relation to the mean frequency of SCE/cell. No significant differences were detected between Groups A and B both of which showed similar frequencies of cells with aberrations, SCE/cell and HFC. No correlations were observed in Group A between lithemia and the biological markers studied.", 
    "138": "Panic disorder, a psychiatric disorder characterised by frequent panic attacks, is the most common anxiety disorder, affecting 2 to 6% of the general population. No one line of treatment has been found to be superior, making a risk-benefit assessment of the treatments available useful for treating patients. Choice of treatment depends on a number of issues, including the adverse effect profile, efficacy and the presence of concomitant syndromes. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are beneficial in the treatment of panic disorder. They have a proven efficacy, are affordable and are conveniently administered. Adverse effects, including jitteriness syndrome, bodyweight gain, anticholinergic effects and orthostatic hypotension are commonly associated with TCAs, but can be managed successfully. Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) reuptake inhibitors are also potential first line agents and are well tolerated and effective, with a favourable adverse effects profile. There is little risk in overdose or of anticholinergic effects. Adverse effects include sedation, dyspepsia and headache early in treatment, and sexual dysfunction and increased anxiety, but these can be effectively managed with proper dosage escalation and management. Benzodiazepines are an effective treatment, providing short-term relief of panic-related symptoms. Patients respond to treatment quickly, providing rapid relief of symptoms. Adverse effects include ataxia and drowsiness, and cognitive and psycho-motor impairment. There are reservations over their first-line use because of concerns regarding abuse and dependence. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, because of their adverse effects profile, potential drug interactions, dietary restrictions, gradual onset of effect and overdose risk, are not considered to be first-line agents. They are effective however, and should be considered for patients with refractory disease. Valproic acid (valproate sodium), while not intensively studied, shows potential for use in panic disorder. More studies are needed in this area before the available data can be confirmed. As a supplement to drug therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy is effective. It is well tolerated, and may be beneficial in certain clinical situations. Its main drawback is the time commitment and effort needed to be made by the patient."
