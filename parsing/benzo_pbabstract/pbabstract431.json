    "0": "Appreciation of the major role played by serotonergic (5-HT3) neuroreceptors in the emetic reflex arc has introduced an additional factor into the rational design of combination antiemetic therapy. Combinations of an antidopaminergic agent and a corticosteroid have previously served as the basis for many successful antiemetic regimens. Three pilot studies and three randomised studies have now demonstrated potentiation of antiemetic activity of a 5-HT3 antagonist by dexamethasone as well. Further development of combination antiemetic regimens may involve antagonism of additional receptors including those for benzodiazepines, opiates, and catecholamines. Even antidopaminergic agents may continue to have a role. Although high-dose metoclopramide has both antiserotonergic and antidopaminergic activity, other pure antidopaminergic agents retain significant antiemetic activity. The combination of an antiserotonergic agent and a low-dose antidopaminergic agent has already shown promise in one pilot study. Newer and more effective antiemetic combinations will be needed to continue to improve the quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy.", 
    "1": "GYKI 52466 is a benzodiazepine molecule that has muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties not attributable to a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-mediated mechanism. Here it is shown that GYKI 52466 exerts no blocking action at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, but acts noncompetitively to block ion currents and associated excitotoxicity, including ischemic neuronal degeneration, mediated through non-NMDA glutamate receptors. The inhibition of non-NMDA responses by GYKI 52466 is antagonized by cyclothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, and diazoxide, benzothiadiazide drugs that inhibit non-NMDA receptor desensitization. These results suggest that non-NMDA receptor-ion channel complexes may contain a novel benzodiazepine recognition site where receptor desensitization is regulated; this postulated site represents a promising new target for rational development of drugs to treat neurological disorders.", 
    "2": "The authors review current neurobiological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The rationale for anatomically based models is outlined and selected brain regions of interest are discussed. The authors conclude that there is abundant evidence to implicate multiple brain regions as sites of abnormality in OCD. A review of neuropharmacological concepts related to the serotonergic (5-HT) hypothesis of OCD is also presented. The authors conclude that anti-obsessional agents may well have therapeutic effects via the 5-HT system, yet there is little unequivocal evidence to suggest an underlying abnormality in the 5-HT system. A comprehensive neurobiological model of OCD must acknowledge the interrelationship between multiple transmitter systems and integrate anatomical with neuropharmacological concepts.", 
    "3": "Benzodiazepine have been shown to suppress ventilatory responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia (HCVR) and isocapnic HVR when taken parenterally. Most patients would, however, prefer to take an oral rather than parenteral preparation but the effect of oral benzodiazepine on these ventilatory responses has not been well studied. We therefore studied the effect of oral midazolam (7.5 mg) and diazepam (5 mg) both given orally on resting ventilation and respiratory drive, as assessed by HCVR and HVR. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, was administered intravenously to reverse the effect. A mental alertness-drowsiness index in five grades, from 1 (awake and alert) to 5 (asleep), was used to assess the sedation effect. Six normal male subjects, (aged 31 +/- 1.6 yrs) (mean +/- SD), participated in the study. Mean resting ventilation, and ventilatory response to HCVR and HVR were not significantly altered by these drugs when taken orally. Flumazenil also had not significant effect on HCVR and HVR. However the mental alertness-drowsiness index rose from 1 to 2.83 with oral midazolam and reversed to 1.25 with flumazenil. Similarly, this index increased from 1 to 2.25 after oral diazepam and reversed to 1.42 after flumazenil. In conclusion, we found that even though oral midazolam and diazepam produced a significant sedation effect, which was reversed with flumazenil, the drugs had no effect on ventilation at rest and the ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia.", 
    "4": "A case is presented of hyperkalaemia (13.6 mEq.L-1) occurring during cardiopulmonary bypass using warm blood cardioplegia (K+ 40-60 mEq.L-1). Treatment with epinephrine, calcium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and furosemide reduced K+ to 6.5 mEq.L-1 within 30 min and myocardial performance was enhanced with amrinone and cardiac rhythm was controlled with A-V segmental pacing. It is believed that the hyperkalaemia resulted from a combination of the surgical procedure (mitral valve replacement) and the use of warm cardioplegia. The purpose of this report is to increase the awareness of the possibility of hyperkalaemia with warm cardioplegia and to describe a successful therapeutic regimen.", 
    "5": "We report a malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patient who required investigation for a large, symptomatic anterior mediastinal mass. Multiple attempts at tissue diagnosis under local anaesthesia were unsuccessful. Following awake fibreoptic tracheal intubation, general anaesthesia was administered using ketamine, midazolam, and nitrous oxide, maintaining spontaneous ventilation. Prophylactic dantrolene was not used, to avoid potential muscle weakness and respiratory compromise. Diagnostic mediastinotomy was performed without incident. We conclude that ketamine anaesthesia is appropriate for patients with anterior mediastinal masses, and is considered safe in malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patients.", 
    "6": "Fifteen patients, 13 male and two female, known to be carrying the sickle-cell gene (12 HbSS and 3 HbAS), who were undergoing operations requiring a bloodless field, were included in the study. Of the 12 with HbSS, seven had haemoglobin A1 component of between 11 and 27%, three had fetal haemoglobin ranging from 5.7 to 29% and the remaining two had increased haemoglobin A2 concentrations suggesting a beta non-thalassaemia combination. All had a tourniquet applied to the appropriate limb and were given general anaesthesia with moderate hyperventilation throughout the procedure. The tourniquet inflation time was 61.7 +/- 27.5 min. The mean PaO2 remained above 200 mmHg, mean PaCO2 was less than 37 mmHg, and pH ranged between 7.40 and 7.45. There were no clinically important changes in BP or ECG. All patients made uneventful recoveries and none developed sickle-cell crises. It is suggested that it is safe to use tourniquet in patients with sickle-cell disease provided optimum acid-base status and oxygenation are maintained throughout the procedure.", 
    "7": "The safety and efficacy of alprazolam and hydroxyzine administered orally as surgical premedicants were compared in a double-blind controlled study. Sixty-five patients were given either alprazolam 1 mg or hydroxyzine 75 mg, one to two hours before surgery. Anxiety was assessed by both the patient and the anaesthetist, the patient using a visual analogue scale, the anaesthetist employing both analogue and ordinal ratings. Sedation was assessed by the anaesthetist only, using the same two methods. Amnesia was appraised with a simple memory test. Safety was assessed by recording adverse effects and measuring haemodynamic variables. Premedication with alprazolam produced a modest reduction in anxiety (28%) (P < 0.01) while hydroxyzine had no detectable effect. The comparison of the sedation level and of the memory test revealed no difference between the two premedicants. Minor side effects were only observed in the hydroxyzine group. Changes in blood pressure were more pronounced in the hydroxyzine group. This study shows that alprazolam and hydroxyzine are safe and efficient oral premedicants. However, alprazolam is preferable to hydroxyzine in terms of anxiolytic and adverse effects.", 
    "8": "The effect of flumazenil (F) on the duration of anaesthesia produced by a single dose of thiopentone (T) and propofol (P) was investigated in a placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Eighty-four patients anaesthetized with N2O in O2 and either thiopentone 7 mg.kg-1 or propofol 3 mg.kg-1 for minor gynaecological procedures were studied. Patients were randomly allocated to pretreatment with either 0.5 mg of flumazenil (F) or 5 ml of normal saline (NS) in one of the following groups: T/NS, T/F, P/NS, or P/F. Anaesthetic requirements were assessed by recording the time between the injection of anaesthetic and the first movement observed during the procedure. The time elapsed from the administration of thiopentone to the first movement was 6.5 +/- 1.6 min for the T/NS group and 5.3 +/- 2.4 min for the T/F group (P < 0.05). The first movement after propofol administration was observed at 7.0 +/- 2.2 min in the P/NS group and at 7.1 +/- 4.5 min in the P/F group (NS). These data suggest that pretreatment with 0.5 mg of flumazenil iv reduces the duration of thiopentone but not of propofol anaesthesia.", 
    "9": "Testosterone metabolism was studied in human adult and fetal liver microsomes. In fetal livers 6 beta-hydroxylase (6 beta OH) activity (1-2% of adult activity) and 2 alpha-hydroxylase (2 alpha OH) activity (about 40% of adult activity) were present. Also some fetal livers produced two unknown metabolites. Androstenedione was formed in all fetal livers studied (10-20% of adult activity). Testosterone hydroxylations at 6 beta-, 2 beta-, 15 alpha- and 15 beta-positions were associated with CYP3A isoform(s) in adult liver, because they were strongly inhibited by midazolam, a known substrate for CYP3A4 and by anti-CYP3A4 antibody. Fetal liver activities were consistently inhibited less than the activities in adult livers. The formation of androstenedione was not affected by these inhibitors in fetal or adult liver microsomes. Benzphetamine N-demethylase activity in the fetal livers was about 40% of adult activity. Anti-CYP3A4 antibody had no effect on that activity in fetal or in adult liver microsomes, whereas a monoclonal antibody 1-68-11 (generated against rat CYP2C11) slightly inhibited benzphetamine N-demethylase activity in adult liver. This study indicates that human fetal and adult liver are dissimilar in their testosterone metabolism pattern. The formation of androstenedione from testosterone in fetal liver may have a physiological role. Testosterone hydroxylases are less inhibited by anti-CYP3A4 antibody, midazolam and progesterone in fetal than in adult liver.", 
    "10": "Midazolam sedation has been shown to diminish recall of one to four cards shown prior to induction of general anesthesia in pediatric patients. This promising but limited finding prompted us to investigate the effect of midazolam sedation on retrograde and anterograde recall and recognition in children scheduled for elective surgery.",

To assess postoperative memory of preoperative events, recall and recognition tasks were performed using a series of picture cards designed for this purpose. Retrograde amnesia was measured by postoperative recall and recognition of cards shown prior to midazolam/placebo administration, and anterograde amnesia was measured by postoperative recall and recognition of cards shown during the interval between midazolam/placebo administration and induction of general anesthesia.", 
    "12": "Compared to placebo, the midazolam group experienced a significant postoperative reduction in ability to both recall (P < .003) and recognize (P < .001) cards shown subsequent to midazolam/placebo administration (anterograde amnesia). In distinction, there was no difference between groups in postoperative ability to recall or recognize cards shown prior to midazolam/placebo administration (retrograde amnesia).", 
    "13": "These results support and extend the inference that midazolam diminishes anterograde recall. In addition, our findings indicate that midazolam diminishes anterograde recognition, thereby providing partial anterograde amnesia without affecting retrograde memory in pediatric patients.",

Although clinical doses of midazolam have minimal effects on cardiac function, the influence of midazolam (and other benzodiazepine sedatives) on cardiac arrhythmogenesis has yet to be elucidated fully.", 
    "15": "In this study, we investigated the effect of midazolam, with and without flumazenil, on the arrhythmogenic serum concentration of epinephrine (ACE) in six halothane-anesthetized dogs. Midazolam was administered as a loading dose (1.5 mg/kg over 5 min) followed by a 4.5-h infusion at two rates (10 and 40 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) to achieve and maintain predetermined clinical and supraclinical plasma midazolam concentrations. The arrhythmogenic serum concentration of epinephrine determinations were made prior to midazolam infusion, following 2 h of midazolam infusion and following 3.5 h of midazolam infusion and 1 mg flumazenil/kg i.v. Saline control studies were also performed in four of the six dogs.", 
    "16": "Plasma midazolam concentrations ranged from 363 to 855 ng/ml in the low-dose infusion study, essentially spanning the clinically effective range for humans. In the high-dose infusion study, plasma midazolam concentrations were up to four times greater, ranging from 1168 to 3563 ng/ml. The arrhythmogenic serum concentration of epinephrine values were unchanged following low-dose midazolam infusion and saline. In the high-dose study, ACE increased from baseline values of 68 +/- 13 (SEM) ng/ml to 112 +/- 25 ng/ml (P = .03) following midazolam infusion and decreased to 79 +/- 13 ng/ml with flumazenil administration. Plasma midazolam concentrations, however, were poorly correlated with ACE values normalized for control ACE (ACE ratio). Diastolic arterial pressure was significantly depressed following both low-dose (-14%) and high-dose (-19%) midazolam infusion. This decrease in blood pressure was unaffected by flumazenil administration. Other hemodynamic parameters were unaffected by drug treatment.",

    "18": "The interactions of both agonists and antagonists with the hippocampal presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptor were studied in a release assay with mechanically dissociated tissue. Muscarinic agonists inhibited potassium-ion-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine maximally by 30 to 40%. Using partial receptor alkylation, the Kd value for oxotremorine-M was determined to be 2.5 microM, whereas the EC50 for this agonist was 0.43 microM; the Kd/EC50 ratio (5.8) indicates that a modest degree of \"spare receptors\" exist for this response. The relative intrinsic efficacies of partial agonists (pilocarpine, [(4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)trimethyl ammonium chloride] and bethanechol) were compatible with the involvement of a mixture of the M2 and the M4 receptor subtypes. With Schild analysis, pirenzepine was shown to block with low potency (Ki = 370 nM), which indicated that the M1 muscarinic receptor was not involved in this response. The potencies of the cardioselective drugs (11-[[2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperdinyl] acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one] and methoctramine (111 and 61 nM, respectively) were somewhat too low to definitely indicate the involvement of an M2 receptor subtype. The Ki values for the smooth muscle/glandular-selective drugs, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methbromide and hexahydrosiladifenidol (2.5 and 87 nM, respectively), were similar to values for these drugs at the M4 subtype, but their potencies did not clearly distinguish this receptor from the M3 subtype. However, the Kd value for himbacine at this receptor (8.6 nM) ruled out involvement of the M3 receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "We measured endogenous noradrenaline (NA) overflow from a vascularly perfused rat stomach in vitro. The stomach was perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution containing 10 microM pargyline. Periarterial nerves, which contain postganglionic sympathetic nerves, around the left gastric artery were stimulated for 1 min with square-wave pulses of 2 msec duration, 2.5 to 5.0 Hz, supramaximal intensity (10 mA). Oxotremorine (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) concentration-dependently inhibited the periarterial nerve stimulation-evoked NA overflow under the presence of 10(-6) M phentolamine. Bilateral vagus nerve stimulation (5 Hz, 2 msec duration, 10 mA, for 1 min) reduced the evoked NA overflow. Oxotremorine (10(-7) M)-induced inhibition of NA overflow was attenuated by atropine, methoctramine (muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (M3 receptor antagonist) and pirenzepine (M1 receptor antagonist) with the following potency; atropine > methoctramine > 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine > pirenzepine. The oxotremorine-induced inhibition was attenuated by N-ethylmaleimide (3 x 10(-5) M for 50 min), but was not affected by pertussis toxin pretreatment (10 micrograms/rat, for 4 days). However, this pretreatment with pertussis toxin abolished completely negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of oxotremorine in rat atria. These results suggest that NA release from gastric sympathetic nerve terminals is inhibited by activation of muscarinic M2 receptor, and this receptor-mediated inhibitory mechanisms are insensitive to pertussis toxin.", 
    "20": "The diphenylpyrazolidinone cholecystokinin (CCK)-B antagonist LY262691 has recently been demonstrated to decrease the number of spontaneously active dopamine (DA) cells in the ventral tegmental area (A10) and substantia nigra (A9) of the anesthetized rat. In the present study, three structural analogs of LY262691 with high selectivity for CCK-B receptors, LY262684, LY191009 and LY242040, also decreased the number of spontaneously active A10 DA cells. Neither an inactive analog (LY206890) nor a CCK-A-selective analog (LY219057) affected the number of spontaneously active A10 DA cells. L-365,260, a benzodiazepine CCK-B antagonist, also decreased the number of spontaneously active A10 DA cells. In addition, the more active optical isomer of LY262691 (LY288513) caused twice as large a decrease in the number of spontaneously active A10 DA cells as the less active optical isomer (LY288512). The diphenylpyrazolidinone CCK-B antagonists, but neither the inactive nor the CCK-A selective analog, also decreased the number of spontaneously active A9 DA cells; however, none of these compounds produced catalepsy in awake animals. Single-unit recordings indicated that LY262691 administration inhibited the activity of individual A9 and A10 DA neurons. These results indicate that the firing of A9 and A10 DA neurons is suppressed specifically by antagonism of CCK-B, but not CCK-A receptors. CCK-B antagonists may therefore represent a novel class of antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, because CCK-B antagonists have no cataleptogenic effects, they may also have a reduced propensity for producing extrapyramidal side effects. In addition, these actions on midbrain DA neurons may contribute to the known anxiolytic activity of CCK-B antagonists.", 
    "21": "The regional distribution of putative M3 receptors was studied by quantitative autoradiography of rat brain sections labeled with 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methioxide. The radioligand appears to label multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes in direct binding assays, as evidenced by competition experiments with unlabeled pirenzepine and 11-([2-[(2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1- piperidinyl]acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodi azepine-6-on. Conditions favoring the selective labeling of M3 receptors were determined on the basis of the competition studies and were subsequently applied to regional mapping of M3 receptor binding. Under the conditions used, autoradiographic images may be obtained with both 9-fold M3-to-M1 selectivity and 12-fold M3-to-M2 selectivity. Although distributed widely at relatively low prevalence throughout the neuraxis, M3 receptors are apparently enriched relative to M1 and M2 receptors in several diencephalic and brain stem regions including thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, the substantia nigra, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray and the pons. The present results suggest that the binding of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methioxide, under appropriate conditions, may permit direct estimation of M3 receptors in mammalian brain.", 
    "22": "Placebo-appropriate responding in drug discrimination can be difficult to interpret because such responding can indicate either the absence of any drug effect or the absence of a specific drug effect. This study addressed the overinclusiveness of placebo-appropriate responding by providing a response alternative for novel-drug effects (i.e., effects unlike the training stimuli). This \"novel-response procedure\" used instructions that indicated that only responses on a novel-appropriate manipulandum would be reinforced in the presence of novel drug effects. Four healthy male volunteers (ages 19-32) were trained to discriminate 0.32 mg/70 kg of triazolam from placebo. Then, dose-effect curves were determined for triazolam (0.1-0.32 mg/70 kg) and d-amphetamine (5 and 20 mg/70 kg) with a standard two-response procedure (drug vs. placebo) and the novel-response procedure. Triazolam produced dose-related increases in triazolam-appropriate responding with both procedures. d-Amphetamine produced predominantly placebo-appropriate responding with the two-response procedure and predominantly novel-appropriate responding with the novel-response procedure. Unexpectedly, the triazolam dose-effect curve obtained with the novel-response procedure was shifted to the left relative to the two-response procedure for discrimination measures. A similar effect was evident for both the triazolam and d-amphetamine dose-effect curves for some self-report measures. Because of the increased selectivity of placebo-appropriate responding and the increased potency of the drug stimulus, the novel-response procedure may represent a methodological advance for drug discrimination research.", 
    "23": "Forty-eight patients with panic disorder completing 8 months of maintenance treatment with alprazolam (mean dose, 5.2 mg [n = 27]), imipramine hydrochloride (mean dose, 175 mg [n = 11]), or placebo (mean dose, 8.0 pills [n = 10]) underwent a gradual taper from medication over a 4-week period. A withdrawal syndrome was observed in almost all alprazolam-treated patients but in only a few imipramine- or placebo-treated patients. The clinical worsening of withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation tended to subside over the course of 3 medication-free weeks, but 33% of alprazolam-treated patients were unable to discontinue their medication regimen successfully. Severity of panic attacks at baseline but not daily alprazolam dose appeared as a significant independent predictor of taper difficulty. Forty-nine percent of the total study population continue to receive drug therapy: 82% alprazolam and 18% imipramine. Among patients who received alprazolam during study treatment and at follow-up, the mean daily dose was substantially reduced (6.1 vs 1.6 mg [n = 14]). At follow-up, after 1 year of naturalistic treatment for panic symptoms and combining 8-month completers and study dropouts, there were no significant differences in remission (68% to 71%) or in antipanic medication intake (39% to 56%) at follow-up for the three original treatment groups.

Patients who improved received an additional 6 months' maintenance treatment. Significantly more patients treated with alprazolam than with imipramine hydrochloride or placebo remained in therapy and experienced panic attack and phobia relief during the acute treatment phase. During the maintenance phase, neither tolerance nor daily dose increase was observed. All patients who completed the maintenance phase (27 in the alprazolam group, 11 in the imipramine group, and 10 in the placebo group) were panic free at the end of 8 months of study treatment. Alprazolam therapy was effective and well tolerated at a mean daily dose of 5.7 mg.

Preanesthetic disposition, depth of sedation, loss of resistance to handling, induction quality, induction time, sternal and stand times, and recovery quality were evaluated. Analgesia and muscle relaxation without supplemental inhalational anesthetics were evaluated in male kittens, and the time until extubation was recorded in female kittens. Intramuscular administration of tiletamine/zolazepam (TZ), midazolam/ketamine, atropine/midazolam/ketamine/butorphanol (AMKB), and atropine/midazolam/ketamine/oxymorphone (AMKO) produced rapid sedation and smooth induction into anesthesia. In male kittens, there were no significant differences in sedation, relaxation, induction time, or quality. Tiletamine/zolazepam administration induced the best analgesia, and midazolam/ketamine administration induced the least analgesia for castration. The recovery time in male kittens was longest with TZ and shortest with the opioid groups (AMKB, AMKO). In females, TZ produced significantly faster induction times, but the degree of sedation and relaxation after administration of injectable agents was not significantly different among the groups. More females given TZ could be intubated without supplemental inhalational agents than females in other groups. Extubation time was rapid in all groups, but the times until sternal and standing were significantly longer, and recovery quality was significantly poorer in females given TZ. In kittens given opioids, reversal of the opioid did not shorten recovery time or improve recovery quality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Insomnia, a remarkably common disturbance in a basic biologic function, arises from multiple psychological, physiologic, and environmental factors. Transient insomnia usually resolves spontaneously. Short-term insomnia is usually normalized by coping with acute changes in a medical condition or a relationship. In patients with insomnia caused by stressful life events, a short (ie, 10 days or less) course of a short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic may be indicated. Long-term insomnia deserves comprehensive evaluation. Psychiatric disorders are common in patients with long-term insomnia. In patients over age 50, intrinsic sleep disorders are more prevalent. Behavioral therapy, including improved sleep hygiene, stimulus-control techniques, and sleep-restriction therapy, is preferred in the management of long-term insomnia. Pharmacotherapy (eg, low-dose antidepressant or benzodiazepine) is best used as an adjunct.", 
    "27": "This three-phase study was designed to determine if a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction exists between zidovudine and oxazepam. Six individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and receiving zidovudine at 500 mg daily, with normal renal and hepatic function, were enrolled. During phase I, zidovudine pharmacokinetics were studied after steady-state oral administration (100 mg every 4 h) and after a single dose (70 mg) of intravenous zidovudine. Phase II consisted of a single oral dose (30 mg) of oxazepam followed by a 48-h blood sampling period. Phase III began with 48 h of concomitant zidovudine, 100 mg orally every 4 h, and oxazepam, 15 mg orally every 8 h, followed by concomitant dosing of intravenous zidovudine and oral oxazepam. Zidovudine concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Oxazepam concentrations were determined with use of a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The calculated bioavailability was 0.61 for zidovudine alone and 0.75 when administered in combination with oxazepam (p = 0.16). Plasma half-life for oral zidovudine alone and in combination with oxazepam was 1.17 h versus 0.99 h, respectively (p = 0.25), and 1.38 h versus 1.15 h (p = 0.38) for intravenous zidovudine during single and combination therapy, respectively. Total body clearance of zidovudine was not significantly altered by oxazepam (93 L/h vs. 109 L/h, p = 0.16). The mean pharmacokinetic parameters determined for a single 30-mg dose of oxazepam for oral clearance, apparent volume of distribution, and plasma half-life were 9.8 L/h, 65.7 L, and 5.1 h, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The aim of the present work was to investigate the impact of disease states and environmental and host factors on the glucuronidation of oxazepam. Glucuronidation represents quantitatively one of the most important metabolic conjugation pathways (phase II) in man for the inactivation and detoxication of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds and the liver is the major site for it to take place. Far less attention has been paid to the conjugation reactions in previous clinical research in this field compared to the immense interest in the oxidative biotransformation pathways (phase I). This fact is mainly due to the latter giving rise to active or reactive metabolites with a toxicological potential. The metabolism of oxazepam expresses exclusively the capacity for glucuronide formation. It was a prerequisite to establish the bioavailability of oxazepam prior to succeeding studies on the oral disposition of the drug. A preparation for intravenous administration was created. Clearance was chosen as measurement of the capacity to glucuronidate oxazepam. Severe decompensated liver disease was associated with a significant decrease in oxazepam clearance, that became even more obvious when corrected for by a diminished binding to plasma proteins. This increase in free fraction of oxazepam was substantial and could mainly be accounted for by low plasma albumin values. The results are in part a settlement with earlier studies on glucuronidation in liver disease and they may undoubtedly be ascribed to the severe degree of liver disease. For the first time it was shown that hypothyroidism led to a decline in the clearance and metabolism of oxazepam and paracetamol that is mainly biotransformed by glucuronidation. It was concluded that the enzymes responsible for glucuronidation in hypothyroidism are under the influence of thyroid hormones as is the case with oxidative enzymes. Further studies focused on the effect of host and environmental factors on glucuronidation. A commercially available very low calorie product for the treatment of obesity resulted in a decrease in oxazepam clearance and a lack of co-factors as a consequence of the low calorie intake was explanatorily proposed. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are often prescribed together with other drugs and close knowledge on interactions is mandatory but insufficient in regard of drugs being glucuronidated. Despite the mutual metabolic pathway labetalol exerted no dispositional alterations concerning oxazepam. It was moreover suggested that very elderly subjects between the age of 80 to 94 years had a reduced clearance of oxazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "29": "Effects of diazepam (1, 2 mg/kg) and buspirone (1.25, 2.5 mg/kg) on locomotor and rearing activity were observed in rats tested in an open field. Both doses of each drug reduced ambulation. However, for buspirone, this effect was confined to females. Walking and rearing was reduced by the higher dose of diazepam and rearing by both doses of buspirone. In rats that had ingested approximately 26 mg/kg/day of chronic caffeine for seven days prior to and immediately before testing, all effects of diazepam observed earlier failed to achieve significance except for ambulation. However, all earlier buspirone effects (including female-only decreased ambulation) were unaffected by the caffeine treatment. It was concluded that buspirone may be preferable to diazepam as an anxiolytic when in the presence of regular caffeine ingestion.",

A significant increase in the concentration of brain LP after electroshock was found.

Nifedipine combined with clorazepate brought an inhibition of LP formation and an additive anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "31": "We have assessed the effect of midazolam on sleep in a model of transient insomnia in healthy adults using polysomnographic recordings. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (placebo or midazolam 7.5 or 15 mg) and spent a single night in the sleep laboratory. Midazolam or placebo were given double-blind immediately before turning off the lights. Midazolam 15 mg was effective in inducing sleep, while 7.5 mg and 15 mg produced improvement in the maintenance of sleep. Subjectively, sleep latency and the number of awakenings were reduced dose-dependently. Midazolam did not impair psychomotor performance on the morning after administration.", 
    "32": "In this study the authors have evaluated the effects of common antiepileptic drugs given alone or in combinations with baclofen on seizures evoked by intravenous flunarizine in rabbits. The abolition of clonic and clonic-tonic convulsions was taken as the end point. Baclofen was able to inhibit convulsions only in a relatively high dose (5 mg/kg). Diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) and clonazepam (2 mg/kg) completely abolished clonic seizures. Valproate (20 mg/kg) inhibited clonic seizures and remained without effect on tonic convulsions. Other antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and acetazolamide were found inactive in this respect. Moreover, combinations of acetazolamide (100 mg/kg) and carbamazepine (50 mg/kg) with baclofen (2 mg/kg) had no anticonvulsant effect. Thus, mainly GABA modulatory drugs reveal significant action against flunarizine-induced seizures.", 
    "33": "We report the preparative separation of rac-zopiclone using malic acid as the resolving agent. Furthermore, two different methods for the analytical determination of zopiclone enantiomers by HPLC on chiral stationary phases are described. The benzodiazepine receptor binding of the isolated enantiomers was investigated. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of (+)- and (-)-zopiclone were 21 or 1,130 nmol/liter, respectively, indicating a more than 50 times higher affinity of the (+)-enantiomer toward the receptor.", 
    "34": "In the present study, not only circulatory parameters but also serum concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, Somatotropin and prolactin after endotracheal intubation were determined during narcosis. In 19 patients undergoing neurosurgical vertebra disc operations, general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and alfentanil, while a control group of 8 patients was given thiopentone. The stress hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay immediately prior to and 1, 3 and 6 minutes after intubation. The induction of anaesthesia with the combination midazolam-alfentanil resulted in considerably fewer alterations of hemodynamic parameters such as arterial blood pressure and heart rate than the induction with thiopentone in both groups could be observed. A direct effect of thiopentone and midazolam on prolactin release could be excluded in a comparative study in which comparable amounts of these substances were administered without intubation. After alfentanil a slight, insignificant rise in the prolactin level occurred. Evaluation of such a short stimulus as endotracheal intubation by so-called stress hormones has not yet been satisfactorily achieved.", 
    "35": "The acute intraperitoneal administration of anxiolytic diazepam (2 mg/kg) inhibits the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, i.e., it decreases the concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone in female rats. This fall of ACTH and corticosterone levels was reversed by an antagonist of central benzodiazepine receptors-flumazenil. The antagonist of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors-PK 11195, failed to affect diazepam-induced decrement of plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels. The suppressed HPA function obtained after diazepam administration was also antagonized by bicuculline, an antagonist of GABA recognition sites, and by picrotoxin, a drug that blocks the GABA-A receptor associated chloride channel. These results suggest that central benzodiazepine receptors, the part of GABA-A macromolecular complex, are involved in diazepam-induced inhibition of the activity of the HPA axis.", 
    "36": "Specific binding sites for GABAA and benzodiazepines were detected in the brain of the frog Rana esculenta after the in vitro incubation of tissue sections with their respective specific agonists [3H] muscimol and [3H] flunitrazepam. Conditions for the binding assay were optimized and as a result binding was saturable and specific. Quantitative autoradiographic receptor measurements in the different brain sections showed that elevated levels of [3H] muscimol binding sites were found in the two layers of the cerebellum (periventricular and external) with the highest binding densities being detected in the periventricular layer. Relatively high densities of [3H] muscimol binding sites were also observed in the torus semicircularis of the mesencephalon and in the thalamic nucleus rotundus and posterolateral nucleus, plus the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the amygdala pars lateralis and the striatum of the telencephalon. Intermediate to low binding levels were obtained in the remaining brain areas such as the external layer of the optic tectum, the dorsomedial and dorsolateral anterior thalamic nuclei, the medial and lateral pallium, the medial septal nucleus, the preoptic nucleus, the dorsal and ventral infundibular nuclei of the hypothalamus and the interpeduncular nucleus. Autoradiographic evaluation of benzodiazepine receptors revealed that binding levels of [3H] flunitrazepam were overall lower than those of the GABAA sites. In fact the highest [3H] flunitrazepam binding levels were observed in the striatum, external layer of the optic tectum and the torus semicircularis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The central GABAA synapses contain specific benzodiazepine binding sites thought to modulate the receptor allosterically for the transmitter. The benzodiazepine receptor represents a modulating site which is located on the GABA-A receptor/chloride channel complex and mediates both positive and negative modulation of the chloride channel. The effects of the benzodiazepines lie in an increase in the receptor-coupled conductivity of chlorides. Different stressors induce changes in the benzodiazepine receptor complex regarding hypersensitivity. There are indications that these stress-induced changes are mediated by an endogenous peptide. The modulation on these receptors is of functional significance in stress-relevant behavioural reactions and in conflict situations. The research results have led to new concepts of the receptor function and of the effects of compounds which are the basis of potential pharmaceuticals. The neuro-pharmacology of the future promises new pharmaceutical targets on the mechanisms of the allosteric modulation of the receptor function.", 
    "38": "Different ligands of both the \"peripheral\" and the \"central\" benzodiazepine receptors were tested for their ability to induce human monocyte chemotaxis. Only the ligands interacting with the \"peripheral receptor\" (diazepam and Ro 5-4864) were active, and their action was blocked by the specific antagonist PK 11-195, but not by the calcium channel blocker nimodipine. As expected, GABA did not stimulate chemotaxis and it did not modulate the chemotaxis induced by other benzodiazepine receptor ligands. The benzodiazepine inverse agonists FG 7142 and Ro 15-3505 were inactive on chemotaxis when given alone, but they enhanced the \"peripheral\" ligand induced chemotaxis. This effect was blocked by an agonist and an antagonist of the \"central\" receptor. These results suggest an interaction between the two different classes of benzodiazepine receptors on human monocytes.", 
    "39": "In order to further characterize the possible role of GABA function in the sleep-inducing properties of benzodiazepines (BZs), we have administered the GABA agonist muscimol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and the GABA antagonist bicuculline (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) IP, alone and in combination with triazolam (0.8 mg/kg). There was no evidence of interaction of these compounds with triazolam vis a vis sleep. These data are consistent with an earlier report indicating a lack of interaction of muscimol with flurazepam, and suggest that non-GABAergic mechanisms may be involved in the hypnotic properties of benzodiazepines.", 
    "40": "Gonadal steroid hormones or their derivatives can alter the GABA receptor complex and GABA-mediated responses. This study examines the influences of the in vivo gonadal steroid milieu on neuronal responses to GABA and benzodiazepine agonists in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of rats. Spontaneous activity and microiontophoretic sensitivity to GABA of single SNr neurons were analyzed in chloral hydrate anesthetized intact male, intact female, orchidectomized male, and ovariectomized female rats using extracellular electrophysiological techniques. Benzodiazepine responses in each hormone group were assessed as 1) the ability of the iontophoretically applied midazolam to enhance GABA sensitivity and 2) the ability of systemically administered diazepam to decrease SNr firing rate. The results indicate that neither sex nor castration modified GABA sensitivity or benzodiazepine responsiveness in the SNr. However, a heightened level of basal SNr activity was observed in males compared to orchidectomized, intact female, or ovariectomized rats. Elevated SNr activity was also observed in males compared with other hormone groups following iontophoretic application of the GABA antagonist SR95531, suggesting that this augmentation in firing rate may be independent of nigral GABAergic control. Regulation of in vivo spontaneous SNr activity may be associated with gonad-related influences on the nigrostriatal system, but appears unrelated to intrinsic alterations in GABA/benzodiazepine responses in this area.", 
    "41": "The effects of Ca2+ ions on 3H-RO 5-4864 binding to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor were examined. Preincubation of rat kidney membranes with Ca2+ at 37 degrees C produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 3H-RO 5-4864 binding. No inhibition was observed in membranes preincubated at 0 degrees C. The effect of Ca2+ was competitive in nature and was fully reversed by the addition of EGTA. At 1 mM, the maximal effect was achieved with CaCl2, whereas CoCl2 and CdCl2 had lesser effects. No other divalent cation salts examined decreased 3H-RO 5-4864 binding to rat kidney membranes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the affinity of 3H-RO 5-4864 binding to rat kidney membranes is regulated by Ca2+ and suggest the presence of cation recognition binding sites coupled to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "42": "State-dependent learning (SDL) induced by benzodiazepine (BDZ) and GABA-A agonists was investigated in the step-through passive avoidance task in rats. Pre-training injection of diazepam or muscimol dose-dependently reduced step-through latency in the test session conducted 24 hr after the training. Injection of either drug before both the training and test sessions, however, failed to reduce the latency. The results show that passive avoidance failures induced by pre-training injections of diazepam and muscimol are due to SDL. In contrast to diazepam and muscimol, baclofen induced no SDL. Diazepam and muscimol were found to substitute for each other in producing SDL. The failure of learning performance in SDL (dissociation in SDL) induced by diazepam was blocked by flumazenil and picrotoxin but not by bicuculline injected before the training session, whereas dissociation in SDL induced by muscimol was blocked by flumazenil, bicuculline and picrotoxin. On the other hand, the success of learning performance in SDL (non-dissociation in SDL) induced by diazepam was blocked by flumazenil, bicuculline and picrotoxin injected before the test session, whereas non-dissociation in SDL induced by muscimol was blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin but not by flumazenil. These results demonstrate that 1) BDZ and GABA-A agonists produce a common drug state, but, 2) roles of each receptor in SDL might be different, i.e., BDZ receptors for dissociation in SDL and GABA-A receptors for non-dissociation in SDL, and 3) chloride ion channels are essential for the induction of SDL by BDZ and GABA-A agonists.", 
    "43": "Injection of GABA and benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonists and antagonists into the medial septum produced bidirectional alterations in hippocampal high-affinity choline transport (HAChT). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in the medial septum with either drug vehicle, a BDZ agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist, or with a GABA-A or GABA-B agonist or antagonist and sacrificed 1 h later for assessment of HAChT in hippocampal synaptosomes. The GABA-A agonist muscimol, the GABA-B agonist baclofen, and the BDZ agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP) produced dose-related decreases in HAChT 1 h following injection into the septum. The muscimol-induced decrease in HAChT was prevented by prior intraseptal injection of the GABA-A antagonist, bicuculline. Intraseptal injection of GABA-A (bicuculline) or GABA-B (2-hydroxysaclofen) antagonists did not alter HAChT, whereas the BDZ antagonist flumazenil (RO15,1788) and the BDZ inverse agonist methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) increased this measure up to 30% in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum can be modulated in a bidirectional way through the pharmacological manipulation of GABA-A, GABA-B, and BDZ receptors. The potential functional and therapeutic consequences of these interactions are discussed.", 
    "44": "1. Intracellular recording techniques were used to study the actions of the transition ion, zinc, on CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurones in adult rat hippocampal slices. 2. Zinc (300 microM) hyperpolarized pyramidal neurones, increased the membrane excitability and also induced periodic, spontaneous giant depolarizing potentials associated with a conductance increase mechanism. 3. The occurrence of spontaneous giant depolarizations was dependent on the zinc concentration (10 microM-1 mM) with an apparent dissociation constant of 98 microM. The frequency of zinc-induced depolarizations was unaffected by the membrane potential from -50 to -100 mV. 4. Stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals or mossy fibre pathways evoked an excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potential complex. In the presence of zinc, nerve fibre stimulation evoked, in an all-or-none fashion, a giant depolarizing potential with an increased membrane conductance. Both spontaneous and evoked depolarizations were inhibited by 1 microM tetrodotoxin. 5. Evoked giant depolarizations were labile with too frequent stimulation resulting in a failure of generation. A minimum time of 140 s was required between stimuli to ensure successive giant depolarizations. 6. Spontaneous and evoked zinc-induced depolarizing potentials were inhibited by bicuculline (10 microM) or picrotoxin (40 microM) and enhanced by pentobarbitone (100 microM) or flurazepam (10 microM), suggesting that these potentials are mediated by activation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors. 7. Ionophoretic application of GABA produced biphasic responses at -60 mV membrane potential. The reversal potentials for the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing GABA responses were -56 +/- 5 and -66 +/- 8 mV respectively. The giant depolarizations induced by zinc reversed at -57 +/- 4 mV. This suggests a dendritic location for the generation of these potentials. 8. Excitatory amino acid antagonists, 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV, 40 microM) or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 microM) did not affect the amplitude but slightly reduced the frequency of the giant depolarizations. 9. It is concluded that zinc induces a synchronized release of GABA, quite independent of intact excitatory synaptic transmission, which acts on GABAA receptors producing large depolarizing synaptic potentials. This increased level of GABA release may be of physiological and pathological importance since zinc is a naturally occurring metal ion endogenous to the central nervous system.", 
    "45": "This review summarizes the evidence available on the involvement in stress of different classes of benzodiazepine receptors and their putative endogenous ligand, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), with particular reference to their role in modifications of the immune response. The presented data from in vitro, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that benzodiazepine receptors and DBI play a major role in regulating steroid production in both the adrenals and central nervous system, and may be involved in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in stress response.", 
    "46": "Rats were trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide (CDAP) from saline in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure. Both CDAP and the nonsedative benzodiazepine partial agonist, bretazenil, dose-dependently substituted for the training dose of CDAP. Training was then suspended and half of the rats were placed on chronic CDAP, while the other half received water. Tolerance to the discriminative stimulus effects of CDAP developed after 1 mo and a final dose of approximately 110 mg/kg/d, as evidenced by the fact that the training dose of CDAP no longer produced drug-appropriate responding. An insurmountable tolerance also developed to bretazenil, as no rat responded on the drug-appropriate lever at doses as high as 56 mg/kg, whereas in the prechronic dose-effect curve, 1 mg/kg of bretazenil produced 100% drug-appropriate responding. One week after chronic CDAP was discontinued, the dose-effect curve for CDAP in the chronic CDAP group was comparable to that obtained in the prechronic phase, indicating that the rats were no longer tolerant to CDAP. In contrast to CDAP, the dose-effect curve for bretazenil did not return to its prechronic level, with higher doses being required for substitution. In the chronic water group, the dose-effect curves for CDAP and bretazenil were essentially the same before, during, and after the chronic regimen. Thus, suspension of training for 6 wk does not result in loss of the discriminative stimulus control. Chronic exposure to CDAP, however, does result in tolerance to the discriminative stimulus effects of CDAP, with an accompanying insurmountable cross-tolerance to the partial benzodiazepine agonist, bretazenil. These results support findings by other investigators who find tolerance to the discriminative stimulus properties of a wide range of psychoactive drugs (Young and Sannerud, 1989).", 
    "47": "This study examines the effects of chronic brief restraint on in vivo benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor binding in mouse brain. Three groups of mice were used. Mice in group 1 were neither restrained nor injected (ACUTE control). Mice in group 2 were restrained for 5-6 s by grabbing the back skin and holding the subject upside-down at a 45 degrees angle as if to be injected (CHRONIC SHAM control) for 7 d. Mice in group 3 (CHRONIC SALINE) received daily single intraperitoneal (ip) injections of saline (5 mL/kg) for 7 d. On d 8 BZD receptors were labeled in vivo by administration of 3 microCi [3H]flumazenil (ip). The levels of ligand bound in vivo to cerebral cortex (CX), cerebellum (CB), brain stem (BS), striatum (ST), hippocampus (HP), and hypothalamus (HY) were determined. Results indicated that the level of binding was significantly (p < 0.01) lower by 30-50% (depending on the brain region) in saline-injected or sham control groups compared to acute control animals. Furthermore, the values for sham control were similar to the saline-treated group. Our data suggest that exposure to chronic mild restraint produces a decrease in in vivo binding of [3H]flumazenil in mouse brain and supports the hypothesis that chronic mild stress produces a decrease in BZD receptor binding sites.", 
    "48": "Under the influence of diazepam in doses of 0.2-2.0 mg/kg in a situation of different probability and value of a reinforcement the dogs--sanguinics and melancholics change their strategy of behavior, from the preference at norm of a reinforcement of the low probability but the better quality to that of the high probability but the worse quality. Under the same conditions the strategy of behaviour of cholerics and phlegmatics practically does not change. The change of behaviour strategy under the influence of diazepam in sanguinics and melancholics is proposed to be connected with a depressing effect of the drug on the hippocampus and amygdala and simultaneous activation of the hypothalamus and the frontal cortex. The data obtained are discussed from the position of P. V. Simonov's concept on the four above-mentioned brain macrostructures as the basis of the type of the higher nervous activity and behaviour of animals and man.", 
    "49": "Since their first description as anomalous high affinity diazepam binding sites in rat peripheral tissues, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been increasingly studied to better understand nonneural effects of the benzodiazepines. The mammalian PBR is ubiquitously distributed with high concentrations in the outer mitochondrial membrane of secretory tissues. In regions of the brain, the density of PBR can equal or exceed the density of central-type benzodiazepine receptors. High affinity PK 11195 binding is diagnostic for the receptor while the affinity for benzodiazepines is species dependent. Recent cDNA cloning of a PBR component, the isoquinoline binding protein (IBP), shows no apparent sequence homology with any GABAA receptor subunits known to comprise central benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. The PBR seems at best only distantly related to CBRs. Recent advances in the pharmacology, biochemistry and molecular biology of the PBR are reviewed.", 
    "50": "High-affinity binding sites for the isoquinoline carboxamide PK 11195 and 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'CD) in human lymphocytes are recognized by two putative endogenous ligands: diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and protoporphyrin IX. We have now demonstrated that several synthetic DBI peptides--analogues to naturally processed human DBI (H-DBI) fragments--differ from protoporphyrin IX in the manner in which they displace [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]4'CD from binding sites associated with intact and cell-free lymphocyte preparations. In particular, the peptide fragments DBI37-80 and DBI37-70 displaced [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]4'CD with higher affinity from their binding sites on intact lymphocytes (Ki approximately 3-5 microM) than from the sites in the cell-free preparation (Ki approximately 20 microM). In contrast, protoporphyrin IX displaced [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]4'CD with higher affinity in the cell-free preparation (Ki - 0.4 microM) than in intact lymphocytes (Ki > 50 microM). Because DBI peptide fragments and protoporphyrin IX do not readily penetrate the plasma membrane of lymphocytes, our results suggest the existence of binding sites located both on the external face of the plasma membrane and intracellularly. The plasma membrane binding sites, recognized essentially only by DBI fragments, are termed here plasma membrane DBI receptors (PDRs). In contrast, the intracellular binding sites, recognized by both DBI fragments and protoporphyrin IX, are presumably located on mitochondria and are termed mitochondrial DBI receptors (MDRs). Immunohistochemical electronmicroscopic studies with antibodies to the synthetic peptide fragments 62-76 of the rat MDR support the hypothesis that PDRs are expressed on lymphocyte plasma membranes.", 
    "51": "A series of 2-arylpyrazolo[4,3-c] quinolin-3-one derivatives, bearing different substituents in the two aromatic rings, were prepared and tested for their ability to displace [3H] flunitrazepam from rat brain membranes. Some compounds have shown an affinity for receptors comparable and sometimes higher than that of CGS series.", 
    "52": "Repeated administration of benzodiazepines has been reported to produce tolerance in animals and humans. Using an elevated plus-maze test and an autoradiographic technique, we investigated whether repeated administration of chlordiazepoxide produced tolerance to its anxiolytic effects, and whether such repeated administration altered benzodiazepine and GABAA receptors. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide was produced when it was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg (i.p.) once a day for 10 and 14 days. In the quantitative autoradiographical study, although repeated chlordiazepoxide treatment had no effect on [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to benzodiazepine receptors, such treatment reduced [3H]muscimol binding to GABAA receptors in the cortex, caudate putamen, and hippocampus. These results suggest firstly, the production of tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of chlordiazepoxide, and, secondly, that this tolerance may be due to the down-regulation of GABAA receptors, but not of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "53": "Prenatal treatment with a low dose of diazepam (1.25 mg/kg/d, gestational day 14-20) has previously been found to cause longterm impairment of cellular immune responses in rat offspring. A possible site of action of diazepam, i.e., the peripheral-type (omega 3) benzodiazepine receptor, was characterized on splenic macrophages as well as on a rat splenic cell preparation containing mainly lymphocytes. In membranes of both preparations, [3H]PK 11195 bound to a single site which in competition experiments exhibited characteristics of the (omega 3) site. Prenatal exposure to diazepam was followed, at 8 weeks of life, by a marked decrease in maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of spleen macrophage membranes in offspring of both sexes, while membranes of the splenic cell preparation exhibited an increase of the dissociation constant of [3H]PK 11195 at 2 and 8 weeks of life. Both types of delayed effects may reduce the metabolic capacity of these immune cells, in which we have also observed deficits of cytokine release.", 
    "54": "The receptor subtype mediating rat alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP)-induced inhibition of gastric emptying of a non nutrient solution was tested in conscious rats using the CGRP1 receptor antagonist, CGRP 8-37, and the CCK antagonist, MK-329. Intravenous injection of alpha-CGRP (0.5 micrograms) decreased gastric emptying to 26.5 +/- 5.8% from 46.4 +/- 3.9% in vehicle-treated group. Intravenous injection of CGRP 8-37 (15 micrograms) did not influence gastric emptying but completely prevented alpha-CGRP inhibitory effect whereas the 47% delay in gastric emptying induced by intravenous cholecystokinin-8 (CCK, 0.25 microgram) was not modified. The CCK antagonist, MK-329 (1 mg) reversed CCK- but not alpha-CGRP-induced delay in gastric emptying. These results demonstrate that CGRP 8-37 is a specific tool to block alpha-CGRP inhibitory action on gastric motor function and suggest that gastric stasis elicited by peripheral injection of alpha-CGRP may involve an interaction with a CGRP1 receptor subtype.",

    "56": "Previous studies have shown that long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice, which were selectively bred for differential responses to the sedative-hypnotic actions of ethanol, also differ in response to several other agents that act at the GABAergic receptor. Binding at cortical benzodiazepine receptors is enhanced differentially by GABA and ethanol in membranes prepared from the two lines of mice with SS receptors enhanced to a greater extent. Heat denaturation studies and other biochemical characterizations of these receptors suggest that the GABAergic receptor complex from the two lines of mice differs. The present study examined whether perturbation of receptor-membrane interactions by treatment with detergent altered either GABA enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding or ethanol enhancement of this binding. Octylglucopyranoside (OCTG), 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), or deoxycholate solubilization of cortical membranes resulted in a loss of the LS/SS difference in GABA enhancement. Ethanol's effects on binding were altered differently from those of GABA by treatment with OCTG as an increase, not a decrease, in enhancement was observed in both lines of mice. These results suggest that protein-membrane interactions play an important role in mediating LS/SS differences in the allosteric interactions within the GABAergic receptor complex.", 
    "57": "In rat brain membranes, the 3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane steroids, pregnanolone, allopregnanolone, alphaxalone and 5 beta-alphaxalone potentiated 1 nM [3H]flunitrazepam binding at the GABAA receptor, with maximal potentiations of 140-150% of control. The potencies of the 5 alpha isomers were greater than the 5 beta and the presence of an 11-keto group conferred lower potency. The potentiation produced by these steroids was antagonised by the 3 beta-OH isomers epipregnanolone, isopregnanolone and betaxalone (60 microM). The dose-effect curves for pregnanolone and allopregnanolone were shifted to the right, with no reduction in the maximal potentiation. In contrast, the maximal effect of alphaxalone and 5 beta-alphaxalone was reduced with no change in EC50. Alphaxalone (1 microM) caused an increase in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the presence of maximal concentrations of pregnanolone or allopregnanolone. These results suggest multiple sites of action for neurosteroids in the brain.",

The results of these studies are presented.", 
    "59": "Triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN) is the major processing product of the endogenous anxiogenic peptide ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor, diazepam binding inhibitor. In the present study, we demonstrated by Northern blot analysis that the mRNA levels for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly increased after 4 hr of incubation of human monocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TTN (10(-11) M), compared with cells incubated with LPS alone. Exposure of monocytes for 20 hr to LPS and TTN (10(-11) M) also stimulated TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor release by 80%, 110%, and 98%, respectively, relative to the response elicited by LPS alone. Smaller stimulatory effects were observed using the prototypic pharmacological peripheral benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 (10(-11) M) (55%, 72%, and 62%, assessed by means of specific enzyme immunoassays). In contrast, TTN and Ro5-4864 did not modulate LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin increased IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha secretion but not that of IL-6 or IL-8. The observed stimulatory effects of TTN and indomethacin were not additive. Taken together, these findings suggest a common mechanism of action for TTN and indomethacin, involving PG formation. In this respect, TTN inhibited prostaglandin (PG) E2 production by 30%. The fact that the observed modulatory effects correlated with PG levels suggests the existence of a second-messenger pathway associated with the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. These results indicate that human TTN differentially modulates the LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and they further support the concept that this endogenous psychoactive peptide could be involved in physiological control of the inflammatory response.", 
    "60": "Chlordiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine that is widely used as a minor tranquilizer. It is also effective in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. In this setting, chlordiazepoxide acts as a sedative and prevents the development of epileptiform activity. Although benzodiazepines are known to augment gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated chloride channels, an action which at least partially accounts for their anticonvulsant properties, there is some evidence to suggest that voltage-activated calcium channels may also be the target of these agents. We therefore studied the effect of chlordiazepoxide in blocking two distinct types of voltage-activated calcium channels in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Chlordiazepoxide reversibly blocked calcium channels in both closed and open configurations. It was slightly more potent in blocking the transient (T-type or type I) than the long-lasting (L-type or type II) type of calcium channels with apparent Ki values of 311 and 398 microM, respectively. In the presence of chlordiazepoxide, the currents of both types of calcium channel currents decayed more quickly than control, an observation that suggests open channel block. Chlordiazepoxide-induced block of T-type calcium channels was use dependent, increasing with an increase in stimulus frequency. This was due primarily to the acceleration of current decay and slowing of recovery from inactivation by chlordiazepoxide. These calcium channel blocking actions could contribute some to the sedative and anticonvulsant properties of chlordiazepoxide in patients suffering from acute alcohol withdrawal and in electric shock-induced seizures in animal models.", 
    "61": "We evaluated the effects of flumazenil (FMZ), a high-affinity benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, on flash-evoked visual potentials (FEPs) in a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). FEPs were recorded in three different consecutive sessions: (1) basal condition, without any pharmacological treatment; (2) 3.5 min after i.v. administration of 5 mg FMZ; (3) 1 min after i.v. administration of 10 mg diazepam (DZP). FMZ provoked a marked increase in the amplitude as well as evident shortening of the latency of early FEP components. DZP reversed these effects. These results are in agreement with our previous findings of anatomical and functional integrity of the geniculo-striate pathways in human CJD and demonstrate functional integrity of benzodiazepine receptors in this visual system in CJD.", 
    "62": "Previous studies demonstrated that the polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and its receptor, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), are involved in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis and that one site of PBR action resides in mitochondria. In the present investigation, evidence is presented that a functional form of PBR is also present at the cell surface. First, PBR was immunolocalized in the rat testis using biotin-streptavidin peroxidase immunocytochemistry, and results revealed that PBR was present exclusively in the interstitial Leydig cells. Next, the distribution of PBR in MA-10 Leydig cells was further examined using confocal microscopy. MA-10 cells were either fixed and immunostained or fixed/permeabilized and immunostained for PBR, followed by generation of confocal microscope optical sections, three-dimensional reconstructions of these sections, and then generation of vertical confocal sections of the three-dimensional reconstruction. In the fixed/unpermeabilized cells, PBR immunostaining at the cell surface was clearly evident, whereas in the fixed/permeabilized cells, intracellular PBR distribution was more robust. These results suggest that the plasma membrane fraction of the receptor could mediate the action of extracellular PBR ligands on Leydig cell function. Next, we examined whether DBI, the naturally occurring PBR ligand, is secreted by testicular cells and whether it could activate the cell surface PBR. Immunolocalization of DBI demonstrated that it was present in both Leydig and Sertoli cells. Further, using an immunoblot assay, we demonstrated that DBI is present in rat testicular interstitial fluid. Metabolic labeling of cultured immature rat Sertoli cells and MA-10 mouse tumor Leydig cells, followed by immunoprecipitation of the secreted proteins with an anti-DBI antiserum, demonstrated that both Leydig and Sertoli cells secrete DBI and could serve as a cell source for the interstitial fluid DBI. Then, we partially purified the DBI present in conditioned medium and interstitial fluid by reverse phase chromatography and demonstrated it to be bioactive, based on displacement of a radiolabeled benzodiazepine (Ro5-4864)-specific ligand for PBR; pronase treatment of different preparations eliminated all bioactivity. We then examined the effects of DBI on Leydig cell function. DBI added to MA-10 cells affected DNA synthesis and cell growth in a biphasic manner; at low concentrations (1 nM), DBI was mitogenic, increasing [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell numbers by 30-40%, while at high concentrations (1 microM), DBI inhibited cell growth (30-40%). Similar effects on cell growth were obtained using the benzodiazepine Ro5-4864.", 
    "63": "The cellular localization of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) was characterized in several human blood cell subpopulations including erythrocytes, platelets, monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), B, NK, T8 and T4-cells. Pharmacological properties of the PBR were established by binding studies and PBR mRNA expression was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction based method. These data clearly indicate 1) the PBR is pharmacologically homogeneous in the various types of blood cells, 2) the rank order of PBR cell density is monocytes = PMN > lymphocytes > platelets > erythrocytes, 3) the PBR appears to be transcriptionally regulated since mRNA levels are roughly correlated with PBR density.", 
    "64": "1. Prolonged administration of a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, such as flumazenil (given to the mother at a dose of 3 mg/kg s.c. from day 14 to day 20 of gestation), produced subtle behavioral changes in rat pups. 2. Flumazenil treatment decreased the rate of ultrasonic vocalization in 15-day old male pups removed from their nest. 3. No significant changes in the locomotor activity of the flumazenil-treated group with respect to controls was found at the end of the second and fourth postnatal week. 4. These results suggest that late prenatal exposure to flumazenil induces in rat offspring behavioral changes characterized by decreased emotional responsiveness to environmental challenges.", 
    "65": "Diseases of the respiratory organs comprise almost 4% of the adverse drug reactions reported to the Spontaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Center, SANZ (169 of the 4415 reports collected between 1981 and 1990). The most frequent reports were coughing caused by ACE inhibitors, attack of bronchial asthma induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and beta-blocking agents, interstitial pneumopathy caused by amiodarone and sulfonamides, and respiratory depression due to benzodiazepines. The spontaneous reporting system does not allow one to determine the incidence, the reports are only of a signal-generating function. Classical semiology and special diagnostic techniques in assessing adverse drug reactions are discussed. A precise analysis of the case, temporal correlation with reaction and exposure time as well as comparisons with similar cases, together with a critical study of the literature on adverse drug reactions, remain the most important diagnostic procedures.", 
    "66": "Psychiatrists should reconsider the use of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines as the primary treatment for aggressive behavior, as these drugs do not have a specific anti-aggressive effect. They reduce aggression often at the cost of grave side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, and cognitive dulling). Newer regimens such as beta-blockers, serotonin-agonists and serenics have fewer side effects, and do not negatively affect cognitive or attentive functions, allowing for more effective rehabilitation of the patient. These drugs are more specific, and positively influence the four axes of cognition, attention, arousal, and mood regulation, which, if unbalanced, can lead to a higher \"noise\" level, and thus increased agitation and aggression.", 
    "67": "Benzodiazepines are one of the most frequently prescribed classes of medications and by far the biggest class of psychotropic drugs. For years they have been under critical discussion both professionally and in public. The questions arise as to what view is held by university teachers on this topic and how much attention is given to benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related problems. Have there been changes in medical teaching in recent years? All the West German departments of psychiatry, internal medicine, and pharmacology were asked by means of a mailed questionnaire to report on their teaching practice. 84.8% of the questionnaires were returned. Results show that mainly psychiatrists and pharmacologists place special emphasis on benzodiazepines in medical teaching. Additionally, in recent years they have devoted more time to this drug class and to related risks in particular. In particular, psychiatrists deal more with benzodiazepines in postgraduate training and the further training of physicians as well as in their scientific research. When the responses of university teachers in psychiatry, internal medicine and pharmacology are summed up, they show that chiefly psychiatrists have responded in their teaching to the current discussion. This contrasts particularly with internists. This has to be discussed in the light of the fact that, in terms of quantity, minor tranquilizers are predominantly prescribed by nonpsychiatrists.", 
    "68": "There is increasing concern with problems of benzodiazepine dependence resulting from long-term use of these drugs. Recent studies have shown that hospitalized patients are frequently prescribed benzodiazepines, often on a short-term basis, but sometimes with discharge prescriptions which may lead to more prolonged use. The present study investigated the factors affecting whether or not a patient was prescribed and administered a benzodiazepine in a public hospital. Patients from a range of medical and surgical wards were assessed to determine their normal sleeping patterns and sleeping patterns during their stay in hospital. Levels of anxiety were also measured. Rates of use were high, with 77% of the sample being prescribed a benzodiazepine and 52% of the whole group receiving the drug on at least one occasion. Age, sex, occupation, and marital status were not significantly associated with prescription or administration. Similarly, anxiety levels before and during admission did not predict usage. However, those prescribed and those actually administered the drug had significantly poorer sleep patterns. The high rate of use of benzodiazepines in this hospital appears to be a response to self-reported sleep difficulties.", 
    "69": "Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was investigated in rats with decerebrate rigidity using the [14C]2-deoxyglucose (2DG) method in order to identify the site responsible for the rigidity. LCGU was increased in the medial vestibular nucleus, the fastigial nucleus, the interpositus nucleus and the dentate nucleus during decerebrate rigidity. Diazepam and tizanidine, centrally acting muscle relaxants, reduced the increase of LCGU in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei. These results suggest that the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei are the possible sites responsible for the development of decerebrate rigidity and the action of some centrally acting muscle relaxants.", 
    "70": "An epidemiological inquiry was carried out in departments of anaesthesia and immunology in French University and General Hospitals, as well as among those who were already known to have an allergo-anaesthesia outpatient clinic. This inquiry aimed to find out how many patients had undergone diagnostic investigations after as well as an anaphylactoid reaction during an anaesthetic in 1990 and 1991, as well as the demographic data, the kind of assessment, the accident mechanism and the drugs involved. Twenty-one French centres replied to the questionnaire and a series of 1,585 patients tested over a two-year period was thus collected. There were three female patients to one male. The reactions occurred mostly in the adult (80%), but 9% were observed in children. Allergological tests for IgE-dependent anaphylaxis were the skin tests (21 centres), combined with radioimmunological assays of specific serum antibodies to muscle relaxants (10 centres), propofol (9 centres), latex (5 centres), leukocyte histamine release (9 centres) and human basophil degranulation test (4 centres). The criteria for a positive result were the same for all centres. Among these 1,585 patients, 813 were recognized as having had a reaction of immunological origin (52%). The substances involved were identified in these 813 patients as being muscle relaxants (70%), latex (12.6%), hypnotics (3.6%), benzodiazepines (2.0%), opioids (1.7%), colloids (4.7%), and antibiotics (2.6%). Suxamethonium was responsible for 43% of the IgE-dependent reactions involving a muscle relaxant, vecuronium for 37%, pancuronium for 13%, alcuronium for 7.6%, atracurium for 6.8% and gallamine for 5.6%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Zopiclone is the first of the cyclopyrrolones, a new class of psychotropic agents which is chemically different from the benzodiazepines (BZD). From an experimental point of view it has qualitatively the pharmacological profile of the tranquilizer-hyponotics, and activity quantitatively differs from hypnotic BZD by its lower myorelaxant. The electroencephalographic studies also demonstrated that its power spectrum is characteristic of a product having a tranquilizing hypnotic potential. The cyclopyrrolones interact with GABA ergic neurotransmission, and have a high affinity for GABA receptor complex. They act on sites close to BZD sites, but physically different. The sleep polygraphic studies have shown that zopiclone has a specific profile. It respects the sleep architecture, specially the delta sleep which is even increased, in some studies. Its residual effects are absent or minimal, and its acceptability is good in the usual conditions of hypnotic prescription.", 
    "72": "Fifty-five patients with moderate to sever panic disorder were treated for 9 weeks with alprazolam or imipramine and were then, except for one patient who had committed suicide, re-examined after on average 3 years of treatment. At follow-up most patients (74%) did not suffer from panic attacks at all. In the beginning of the study 87% exhibited phobic avoidance behaviour but after 3 years 68% no longer revealed phobic behaviour. At follow-up 28% of the patients were no longer having psychotropic drug treatment and 20% were completely free of overt psychopathology. No tolerance phenomena were associated with the long-term medication applied in the study.", 
    "73": "A new approach to preclinical pharmacodynamic investigations is presented which allows, in addition to information on the nature of the pharmacological properties of new chemical entities, also important quantitative pharmacodynamic information to be derived. A single intravenous dose is administered to chronically instrumented rats and the time course of the pharmacological effect is determined in conjunction with plasma or serum concentrations. Datasets obtained in this way are subjected to simultaneous pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling to obtain estimates of pharmacodynamic parameters such as EC50, Emax, Hill factor and the rate of biophase equilibration. The new approach was applied in studies with benzodiazepines, baclofen, antiepileptic drugs and adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists. In these studies quantitative EEG parameters, the threshold for convulsion as determined by direct cortical stimulation and various haemodynamic variables were used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. For drugs exhibiting agonistic or inverse agonistic properties, realistic estimates of the potency and intrinsic efficacy could be obtained by modelling of the direct effects in the various effect models. Estimates of the potency of competitive antagonists (e.g. flumazenil, cyclopentyl-theophylline) could be obtained on the basis of modelling of the pharmacodynamic interaction with a full agonist. For baclofen finally also the rate of biophase equilibration could be estimated. The results of these studies show that by implementation of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling in pre-clinical investigations, useful quantitative information on the pharmacodynamics of new drugs in vivo can be obtained. It is suggested that this information may be of value in the early phases of pre-clinical drug development and that it may facilitate the subsequent clinical development process.", 
    "74": "The authors analyzed rhythmical involuntary movements at rest, which appeared as complications in 12 (sporadic 11, hereditary 1) out of a total of 139 cases (sporadic 99, hereditary 40) of olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy. These movements tended to be seen in patients with sporadic OPCA of longer illness duration and at more advanced stages. They were distributed over the face, neck and extremities. Palatal myoclonus was observed in only one case. The movements were exacerbated by maintenance of a fixed posture, motion and mental stress, and stopped during sleep. In some cases, clonazepam, trihexyphenidyl or 1-Dopa was effective. In the surface electromyogram, rhythmical grouped discharges of 2-4 Hz were recorded only on agonist muscles or on both agonist and antagonist muscles synchronously, which is characteristic of skeletal myoclonus. However, pathological study of 3 cases with involuntary movements revealed marked putaminal degenerations as compared with 3 uncomplicated cases. This suggests that these rhythmical movements might be related to parkinsonian tremor.", 
    "75": "Seven patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, aged 62 to 76 years, average duration of the disease approximately eleven years, suffering from severe hallucinosis and paranoid delusions of different degree, in whom conventional therapeutic strategies (administration of benzodiazepines and mild neuroleptics) had no antipsychotic effect, received clozapine, a non-classical highly potent neuroleptic, while blood count was strictly monitored. Paranoid ideas disappeared in all seven patients after a maximum of four days administration of 25-125 mg/day. No deterioration of parkinsonian symptoms, quantified according to UPDRS was seen. Given the protection of clozapine, we could increase the L-dopa dose in two cases, thereby improving the patients' motor function. Blood count showed no abnormalities in any of the patients during an average observation period of seventeen months. Our results support the assumption that clozapine has a potent antipsychotic effect in the treatment of psychotic decompensation in advanced Parkinson's disease in carefully selected patients. We saw no negative influence of the neuroleptic on extrapyramidal symptoms.", 
    "76": "The aim of the study was to assess prevalence and treatment modalities of insomnia in general practice. To investigate the course of insomnia, a longitudinal study design was adopted. Two thousand five hundred and twelve patients (age 18-65 years) were investigated with a questionnaire in general practice (T1). Four months later (T2) and again 2 years later (T3) a questionnaire was sent to all patients who had complained about severe insomnia at the time of the first inquiry. To assess insomnia, operationalized diagnostic criteria were applied (DSM-III-R). Eighteen point seven percent suffered from severe, 12.2% suffered from moderate and 15% suffered from mild insomnia. In the course of 2 years insomnia appeared as a chronic health problem. A high comorbidity of severe insomnia was found with chronic somatic and psychiatric disorders, especially with depression. Of the severely insomniac patients, 23.9% used prescribed hypnotics habitually, mainly benzodiazepines. The use of prescribed hypnotics remained rather stable during the whole study period. More than half of the patients reported a daily use of the hypnotics for 1-5 years or longer, but only 22% of the severely insomniac patients reported at the time of the third inquiry a significant improvement of insomnia due to the administration of sleeping pills. Thus, the long-term administration of benzodiazepine hypnotics seems to be an inadequate treatment strategy in chronic insomnia. Whether the occurrence of rebound insomnia after benzodiazepine withdrawal may be one of the main factors for chronic hypnotic use requires discussion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Changes in somatosensory evoked potentials were studied in 88 rats following intravenous injections of diazepam (0.5, 1 and 5 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.5 and 5 mg/kg). The antagonist effect of flumazenil against previously administered diazepam was evaluated by somatosensory evoked potentials, when given in the same doses. Generally, a peak-latency increase and an amplitude reduction were observed after diazepam administration. The low dose of flumazenil led to similar changes in somatosensory evoked potentials. The higher dose of flumazenil resulted in an immediate, short-lasting latency decrease of the late cortical potentials and an amplitude reduction with a delay in its appearance. According to the obtained data, diazepam elicited a marked suppressive action mainly on the corticocortical processing of the sensor information with a milder effect on the thalamic level. Flumazenil showed some intrinsic activities with the low dose effects being benzodiazepine-like and the higher dose resulting in two overlapping opposite actions (initially stimulant and subsequently suppressive). The same flumazenil doses, applied 30 min after injection of diazepam, were able to fully or partially reverse (with some dose differences) the diazepam-induced latency prolongations, whereas flumazenil could not antagonize significantly the diazepam effect on the amplitudes. This may be due to the greater influence of diazepam on the amplitudes.", 
    "78": "Exocrine pancreatic secretion in conscious dogs is significantly stimulated by the intravenous application of small doses of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP; 30 pmol x kg-1 x h-1). There is no increase of the GRP concentrations in peripheral blood which is also the case under physiological postprandial conditions. There is also no increase in the peripheral cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations, in contrast to previous reports. Nevertheless other CCK-related mechanisms may play an important role, since the administration of the highly specific CCK receptor antagonist MK-329 causes a marked reduction of the GRP-induced exocrine pancreatic secretion.", 
    "79": "Brofaromine is a tight-binding, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), with concomitant serotonin (5-HT) uptake-inhibiting properties. In psychopharmacologic investigations, the compound shows the properties expected of an MAO inhibitor, antagonizing the effects of reserpine, tetrabenazine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan in rats and mice, and suppressing rapid eye movement sleep in cats. Brofaromine showed antidepressant-like activity in a rat social conflict test. In radioligand binding assays, brofaromine exhibited weak or no interaction with alpha 1- and alpha 2-noradrenergic, 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, cholinergic, histamine H1 and H2, mu-opiate, GABAA, benzodiazepine, adenosine, neurotensin, and substance P receptors. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo potencies to inhibit 5-HT uptake with those of reference drugs, and direct evidence in patients and volunteers suggest that 5-HT uptake inhibition plays a role in the clinical profile of brofaromine.", 
    "80": "The effect of a sauna on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of ephedrine 50 mg and midazolam 15 mg have been studied in 6 young healthy women in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The sauna (3 x 10 min; temperature 80-100 degrees C; relative humidity 30-50%) modified the pharmacokinetics of both drugs: it retarded the absorption of midazolam estimated as Ka values, and it reduced the mean plasma midazolam concentrations at 2 h; ephedrine, was absorbed more rapidly and the maximum plasma concentration occurred earlier than in the control sessions. Changes in the pharmacodynamics due to the sauna were consistent with the pharmacokinetic findings: midazolam decreased flicker recognition and induced exophoria significantly less during the early sauna period than in the control session, whereas ephedrine made the volunteers subjectively more alert at that time. Later, at 2.5 and 3.5 h (1 h 20 min and 2 h 20 min after cessation of the sauna), and despite the equalisation of the plasma levels, midazolam caused significantly more exophoria after the sauna than in the control situation. This indicates an influence of a sauna on drug pharmacodynamics in the post-sauna adaptive phase. The results suggest that exposure to a sauna may alter both drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.", 
    "81": "The effects of single doses of CL284,846 (20 mg), lorazepam (2 mg) and placebo on psychomotor performance, memory function and subjective feelings were assessed in 12 normal, healthy male volunteers. Each subject received each treatment in balanced order and a minimum of 6 days was left between treatments. The subjects performance on a comprehensive battery of tests of psychomotor performance, memory function and subjective ratings was assessed pre-treatment and at 1, 3 and 5 h post-treatment. In general, the effects of CL284,846 on memory were similar to those of lorazepam at 1 h post-treatment but, recovery was rapid with CL284,846. Impairments induced by lorazepam persisted throughout the post-drug testing sessions. This pattern of effects was repeated across most of the variables tested. However, at 1 h, CL284,846 produced less marked psychomotor impairment than lorazepam. The results of this study suggest that CL284,846 is a safe, rapid acting and effective sedative with some clear advantages over lorazepam with respect to unwanted cognitive and psychomotor impairments.", 
    "82": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) belongs to the group of substances known as brain-gut peptides: it functions both as a neuropeptide and a gut hormone. The peptide and its synthetic derivatives (like for instance CCK-8 and the amphibian counterpart caerulein) significantly delay emptying of gastric contents in both animals and humans. The fact that CCK, in doses mimicking postprandial plasma levels, strongly affects emptying rate suggests the peptide to be a physiologic regulator of gastric emptying. Unfortunately, clear definition of the role of CCK in the physiology of gastric motor activity has long been hampered by the lack of specific and potent non-peptide antagonists of CCK-receptors. The availability of such compounds has stimulated a broad array of investigations into the physiological actions of this hormone and examination of its putative role in certain diseases. This paper summarizes the available data concerning the effect of CCK and its antagonists on gastric emptying. The use of selective CCK-antagonists has allowed to establish that the gastric motor effect of the peptide is direct and mediated through the stimulation of CCK-A receptors. As a consequence, CCK-A antagonism results in acceleration of emptying rate under certain experimental and clinical conditions. This peculiar pharmacologic effect of CCK-A antagonists, which could be useful in the treatment of functional dyspepsia (idiopathic or diabetic), gastroparesis and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (where patients often display a delayed emptying rate of solid food) needs to be further investigated, in order to fully explore their potential as gastrokinetic drugs.", 
    "83": "Different classes of GABAergic drugs--baclofen, GABA, muscimol, Na-valproate, Mg-valproate and diazepam--were tested per os on ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats. The GABAB agonist baclofen failed to affect gastric susceptibility to ethanol damage, while all the other compounds exerted a dose-dependent inhibition on haemorrhagic-necrotic lesions. This effect was not significantly reversed by the specific GABAA antagonist bicuculline, suggesting it to be independent from GABAA receptors. The blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin significantly decreased the gastroprotective action of GABA, Na- and Mg-valproate, but did not antagonize the effect of muscimol and diazepam. Gastric juice volume and pH showed remarkable differences between the various treatments.", 
    "84": "A data-analytic strategy is proposed for identifying the symptom-specific effects of each medication in a clinical trial. The within-group effect size is a standardized ratio of the pre-post change relative to the stability of change for each treatment group. Advantages of using this descriptive approach are illustrated by examining antidepressant effects of alprazolam, imipramine, and placebo in a clinical trial for patients meeting criteria for both panic disorder and depression. There was a significant difference between active medication and placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) total, but no difference between the anti-depressant effects of the active medications despite their diverse psychopharmacologic properties. Examination of effect sizes for each HAM-D item revealed distinct symptom-specific effects of each active medication in this study sample. Although these descriptive findings cannot be used for inferential conclusions, they can be used to guide the design of future trials.", 
    "85": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes have been identified on airways of several mammalian species, including humans. They are distributed in the lung over submucosal glands, airway ganglia and over the nerves; M1-receptors are found in airway ganglia, M2-receptors (autoreceptors) are present in cholinergic postganglionic nerves at the prejunctional level, whereas the muscarinic receptor subtypes found in airway smooth muscle are of the M3-receptor subtype. We had previously reported the presence of M1-receptors on the smooth muscle of large and small airways of patients suffering from chronic bronchitis, but only is the peripheral airways of healthy subjects; one possible explanation of these results is that the bronchial epithelium may play a role in bronchial responsiveness to relaxant muscarinic antagonists. To clarify this hypothesis we have studied in vitro the responses to acetylcholine (ACh), and some muscarinic selective (pirenzepine, PZ; p-fluorohexahydrosiladyphenidol, pFHHSiD) and non-selective (atropine, ATR) antagonists, on human bronchial smooth muscle in the presence and in the absence of epithelium. The absence of epithelium did not modify the responsiveness to ACh to any great extent and did not change the responsiveness to relaxant antagonists. Our results show that the M1-receptors may play a role in mediating contraction of airway smooth muscle; research is in progress regarding their function in disease.", 
    "86": "Flunitrazepam (1 mg) or placebo was administered once daily over a treatment period of 8 days to healthy, male volunteers to study the time course of the effects on memory functions and on subjective ratings of alertness and tension. The plasma level of flunitrazepam increased by approximately 40% (P < 0.05) during the treatment period. The mean pre-dose level of flunitrazepam on day 4 and day 8 was approximately 0.005 microM, and no residual effects on memory functions were observed. Intake of flunitrazepam decreased the number of freely recalled words by about 85% (P < 0.05) and significantly affected the subjects' rating of attention when tested during the first few hours after drug intake on day 1 of treatment. However, no significant effect on the subjects' rating of relaxation was observed. When tested similarly after 8 days treatment, flunitrazepam significantly affected the subjects' rating of relaxation (P < 0.01). Furthermore, no tolerance developed for the effect of flunitrazepam on free recall (P > 0.3) and the subjects' rating of attention (P > 0.7), and these effects had nearly equal time courses during the treatment period. This may indicate that the amnesic effect of benzodiazepines is at least partially mediated through the effects on attention or general arousal. Two of the subjects in the active drug group reported adverse reactions or incidents of discomfort during the 1st week following the treatment period, whereas none in the placebo group reported such reactions.", 
    "87": "The aim of this study was to examine the anti-depressant drug prescribing preferences and habits of a population of general practitioners. The method used was that of a questionnaire survey, including case vignettes. The response rate exceeded 70% Data are presented out-lining the attitudes of the respondents to the use of antidepressant drugs in the management of common psychiatric presentations in the primary care setting. The majority of general practitioners (G.P.'s) had received little or no post-graduate education in psychiatry. The antidepressants most frequently prescribed were amitriptyline, clomipramine, trazodone and lofepramine. Despite recognition of the alarming frequency of serious self-poisoning incidents with some of these compounds, 26% of respondents confessed to an inability to make an informed choice of antidepressant drug, with 14% using the same drug with every patient with no attempt to select according to individual patient requirements. The management of depressive neurosis generates considerable clinical confusion with a variety of interventions favoured. The use of a sedating antidepressant is popular. There is greater accord for the management of endogenomorphic depression. The use of the benzodiazepine drugs in the management of anxiety disorders is infrequent, with appropriate recognition of the merits of behavioural approaches. However, the role for antidepressant drugs in the management of anxiety disorders is under-recognized. We conclude that general practitioners are required to undertake a significant body of work for which they may be inadequately trained.", 
    "88": "Case reports are presented demonstrating a new, safe, and simple intravenous technique for outpatient anesthesia. Vinnik's technique requires hypnotic doses of diazepam (Valium) to prevent ketamine-induced hallucinations. The initial hypothesis tested in this clinical series was whether hypnotic doses of propofol would prevent hallucinations from ketamine as satisfactorily as diazepam. Once the initial hypothesis was confirmed, consideration was given to moderating the cost of propofol by determining the effect of two levels of midazolam premedication on propofol requirements. Hypnotic doses of propofol do prevent ketamine-induced hallucinations. It is possible to achieve significant propofol savings by premedication with midazolam without compromising patient readiness for discharge by the end of the first postoperative hour.", 
    "89": "The pharmacokinetics of high-dose busulphan was studied in 17 patients during conditioning prior to bone marrow transplantation using deuterium-labeled busulphan (d8-BU). About 50% of busulphan doses 1 and 16 was replaced with d8-BU. Patients were treated with phenytoin or diazepam as prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Patients who received phenytoin demonstrated significantly higher clearance (mean +/- SD, 3.32 +/- 0.99 ml min-1 kg-1), a lower area under the concentration-time curve (AUC, 5,412 +/- 1,534 ng h ml-1; corrected for dose/kilogram) and a shorter elimination half-life (3.03 +/- 0.57 h) for the last dose of d8-BU (dose 16) as compared with the first dose (2.80 +/- 0.78 ml min-1 kg-1, 6,475 +/- 2,223 ng h ml-1 and 3.94 +/- 1.10 h, respectively). No difference in the above mentioned pharmacokinetic parameters was seen in patients treated with diazepam. Moreover, a continuous decrease in the steady-state level of busulphan was observed in four of seven patients in the phenytoin-treated group, whereas in the diazepam group, such a decrease was seen in only one of eight patients. We conclude that phenytoin used as prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy alters busulphan pharmacokinetics and, most probably, its pharmacodynamics. For adequate prophylactic therapy, anticonvulsants with fewer enzyme-inductive properties than phenytoin should be used."
