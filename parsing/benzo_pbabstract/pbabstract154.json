Oral midazolam has been the most commonly used premedication for pediatric patient but the use of midazolam may be associated with paradoxical reactions in children. Melatonin may induce a natural sleepiness and improve sedation. We have investigated premedication with melatonin compared with midazolam in children under nitrous oxide/oxygen (N(2)O/O(2)) sedation for dental treatment.", 
    "1": "In a randomized study, 60 children received either 3 mg of melatonin [Melatonina (3 mg(R)) 60 min before the procedure (n = 15); group I], 0.5 mg.kg(-1) melatonin 60 min before the procedure (n = 15; group II), 0.75 mg.kg(-1) midazolam [Dormicum (15 mg/3 ml (R)) 15 min before the procedure (n = 15); group III] or 3 ml of 0.09 NaCl 15 min (n = 7) or 60 min before the procedure (n = 8; group IV) orally. The children were sedated with 40/60% N(2)O/O(2) inhalation. The heart rate and O(2) saturation were monitored during the treatment period. The level of sedation was assessed according to the Ramsay Sedation Scale. The children's sedation success during dental treatment was classified. The sedation success and other sedation-related events recorded. Comparisons among the four groups were made using one-way anova or Kruskal-Wallis test, and if any significant differences were noted, the Tukey's HSD or Mann-Whitney U-test were used for intergroup comparisons. All differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.", 
    "2": "The evaluation of sedation success was as follows: group I: satisfactory (n = 1), average satisfactory (n = 4), and unsatisfactory (n = 10); group II: satisfactory (n = 2), average satisfactory (n = 3), and unsatisfactory (n = 10); group III: satisfactory (n = 9), average satisfactory (n = 6); and group IV: satisfactory (n = 1), average satisfactory (n = 3), and unsatisfactory (n = 11).",

Nitrogen heterocycles are present in many compounds of enormous practical importance, ranging from pharmaceutical agents and biological probes to electroactive materials. Direct functionalization of nitrogen heterocycles through C-H bond activation constitutes a powerful means of regioselectively introducing a variety of substituents with diverse functional groups onto the heterocycle scaffold. Working together, our two groups have developed a family of Rh-catalyzed heterocycle alkylation and arylation reactions that are notable for their high level of functional-group compatibility. This Account describes our work in this area, emphasizing the relevant mechanistic insights that enabled synthetic advances and distinguished the resulting transformations from other methods. We initially discovered an intramolecular Rh-catalyzed C-2 alkylation of azoles by alkenyl groups. That reaction provided access to a number of di-, tri-, and tetracyclic azole derivatives. We then developed conditions that exploited microwave heating to expedite these reactions. While investigating the mechanism of this transformation, we discovered that a novel substrate-derived Rh- N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex was involved as an intermediate. We then synthesized analogous Rh-NHC complexes directly by treating precursors to the intermediate [RhCl(PCy 3)2] with N-methylbenzimidazole, 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline, and 1-methyl-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one. Extensive kinetic analysis and DFT calculations supported a mechanism for carbene formation in which the catalytically active RhCl(PCy 3) 2 fragment coordinates to the heterocycle before intramolecular activation of the C-H bond occurs. The resulting Rh-H intermediate ultimately tautomerizes to the observed carbene complex. With this mechanistic information and the discovery that acid cocatalysts accelerate the alkylation, we developed conditions that efficiently and intermolecularly alkylate a variety of heterocycles, including azoles, azolines, dihydroquinazolines, pyridines, and quinolines, with a wide range of functionalized olefins. We demonstrated the utility of this methodology in the synthesis of natural products, drug candidates, and other biologically active molecules. In addition, we developed conditions to directly arylate these heterocycles with aryl halides. Our initial conditions that used PCy 3 as a ligand were successful only for aryl iodides. However, efforts designed to avoid catalyst decomposition led to the development of ligands based on 9-phosphabicyclo[4.2.1]nonane (phoban) that also facilitated the coupling of aryl bromides. We then replicated the unique coordination environment, stability, and catalytic activity of this complex using the much simpler tetrahydrophosphepine ligands and developed conditions that coupled aryl bromides bearing diverse functional groups without the use of a glovebox or purified reagents. With further mechanistic inquiry, we anticipate that researchers will better understand the details of the aforementioned Rh-catalyzed C-H bond functionalization reactions, resulting in the design of more efficient and robust catalysts, expanded substrate scope, and new transformations.", 
    "5": "The rapid progress in treatments for bipolar disorder makes it necessary to revise the Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Bipolar Disorder (KMAP-BP) published in 2002. This study was performed to timely revise KMAP-BP 2002. A questionnaire comprising 37 questions and 645 treatment options was developed for surveying the opinions of Korean experts. We classified the opinions into three categories: first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Fifty-three (75.7%) of the 70 selected experts answered the questionnaire. For an acute manic episode, the combination of a mood stabilizer (MS) and an atypical antipsychotic (AAP) was the preferred first-line treatment. Most experts recommended divalproex and lithium as MSs, and olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone as AAPs. For moderately to severely depressed bipolar patients, MS monotherapy and a combination of an MS and an antidepressant (AD) were considered to be preferred treatments respectively. A combination of an MS and an AD was the preferred strategy in severe nonpsychotic depression. Most ADs were rated as second-line drugs. Overall, the preference for lamotrigine and AAPs was higher than in KMAP-BP 2002. The algorithm was developed mainly using consensus among experts supplemented with findings of recent clinical trials to ensure that our algorithm was both up to date and balanced. These results suggest that the medication strategies of KMAP-BP are changing rapidly, reflecting recent studies and clinical experiences.",

    "10": "Comorbidity is very common among patients with anxiety and depressive disorders, and, even when full criteria for 2 separate disorders are not met, subsyndromal symptoms are often present. Little controlled research has explored how benzodiazepines and SSRIs/SNRIs may be usefully combined, yet their combination is frequently employed in clinical practice. Patients with comorbidities are likely to have poorer treatment outcomes and have greater utilization of health care resources. Currently SSRIs/SNRIs are considered first-line therapy and are effective in both anxiety and depressive states. Nevertheless, many patients have only a partial response or have difficulty tolerating efficacious doses of antidepressant monotherapy. Benzodiazepines appear to improve treatment outcomes when an anxiety disorder co-occurs with depression or for depression characterized by anxious features. Specifically, they may provide benefits both in terms of speed of response and overall response.", 
    "11": "Long-term management plans for anxiety disorder with or without comorbid depression should include strategies for acute or short-term care, long-term maintenance, and episodic or breakthrough symptoms. Combination therapy with benzodiazepines and antide-pressants in appropriate clinical settings may improve outcomes over monotherapy in some patients.", 
    "12": "Accumulating evidence indicates that synchronization of cortical neuronal activity at gamma-band frequencies is important for various types of perceptual and cognitive processes and that GABA-A receptor-mediated transmission is required for the induction of these network oscillations. In turn, the abnormalities in GABA transmission postulated to play a role in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia might contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this illness. We measured the ability to increase GABA in eight healthy subjects by comparing the binding of [(11)C]flumazenil, a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer specific for the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site, at baseline and in the presence of an acute elevation in GABA levels through the blockade of the GABA membrane transporter (GAT1). Preclinical work suggests that increased GABA levels enhance the affinity of GABA-A receptors for BDZ ligands (termed 'GABA shift'). Theoretically, such an increase in the affinity of GABA-A receptors should be detected as an increase in the binding of a GABA-A BDZ-receptor site-specific PET radioligand. GAT1 blockade resulted in significant increases in mean (+/- SD) [(11)C]flumazenil-binding potential (BP(ND)) over baseline in brain regions representing the major functional domains of the cerebral cortex: association cortex +15.2+/-20.2% (p=0.05), sensory cortex +13.5+/-15.5% (p=0.03) and limbic (medial temporal lobe, MTL) +16.4+/-20.2% (p=0.03). The increase in [(11)C]flumazenil-BP(ND) was not accounted for by differences in the plasma-free fraction (f(P); paired t-test p=0.24) or changes in the nonspecific binding (pons V(T), p=0.73). Moreover, the ability to increase GABA strongly predicted (r=0.85, p=0.015) the ability to entrain cortical networks, measured through EEG gamma synchrony during a cognitive control task in these same subjects. Although additional studies are necessary to further validate this technique, these data provide preliminary evidence of the ability to measure in vivo, with PET, acute fluctuations in extracellular GABA levels and provide the first in vivo documentation of a relationship between GABA neurotransmission and EEG gamma-band power in humans.",

    "14": "Recent epidemiologic studies have identified a high frequency of oversedation in the ICU that is attributable, in part, to a number of pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic, and pharmacodynamic factors. New evidence suggests that the administration of benzodiazepines, even when dosed intermittently, will lead to more oversedation than either propofol or dexmedetomidine and is associated with greater healthcare costs. Based on this data, clinicians should limit the use of benzodiazepines to those patients with anxiety, seizures, alcohol withdrawal, or in whom a deeper level of sedation or therapeutic paralysis is required.",

    "16": "A reliable liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry has been developed for simultaneous evaluation of the activities of five cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A) in rat plasma and urine. The five-specific probe substrates/metabolites include phenacetin/paracetamol (CYP1A2), tolbutamide/4-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide (CYP2C9), mephenytoin/4'-hydroxymephenytoin (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan/dextrorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam/1'-hydroxymidazolam (CYP3A). Internal standards were brodimoprim (for phenacetin, paracetamol, midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam), ofloxacin (for 4'-hydroxymephenytoin, dextromethorphan and dextrorphan) and meloxicam (for tolbutamide, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide). Sample preparation was conducted with solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges. The chromatography was performed using a C(18) column with mobile phase consisting of methanol/0.1% formic acid in 20 mM ammonium formate (75:25). The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometric detection was operated in both positive mode (for phenacetin, paracetamol, midazolam, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, brodimoprim, 4'-hydroxymephenytoin, dextromethorphan, dextrorphan and ofloxacin) and negative mode (for tolbutamide, 4-hydroxytolbutamide, carboxytolbutamide and meloxicam). Multiple reaction monitoring mode was used for data acquisition. Calibration ranges in plasma were 2.5-2500 ng/mL for phenacetin, 2.5-2500 ng/mL for paracetamol, 5-500 ng/mL for midazolam, and 0.5-500 ng/mL for 1'-hydroxymidazolam. In urine calibration ranges were 5-1000 ng/mL for dextromethorphan, 0.05-10 microg/mL for dextrorphan and 4'-hydroxymephenytoin, 5-2000 ng/mL for tolbutamide, 0.05-20 microg/mL for 4-hydroxytolbutamide and 0.025-10 microg/mL for carboxytolbutamide. The intra- and inter-day precision were 4.3-12.4% and 1.5-14.8%, respectively for all of the above analytes. The intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged from -9.1 to 8.3% and -10 to 9.2%, respectively for all of the above analytes. The lower limits of quantification were 2.5 ng/mL for phenacetin and paracetamol, 5 ng/mL for midazolam, 0.5 ng/mL for 1'-hydroxymidazolam, 5 ng/mL for dextromethorphan, 50 ng/mL for dextrorphan and 4'-hydroxymephenytoin, 5 ng/mL for tolbutamide, 50 ng/mL for 4-hydroxytolbutamide and 25 ng/mL for carboxytolbutamide. All the analytes were evaluated for short-term (24 h, room temperature), long-term (3 months, -20 degrees C), three freeze-thaw cycles and autosampler (24 h, 4 degrees C) stability. The stability of urine samples was also prepared with and without beta-glucuronidase incubation (37 degrees C) and measured comparatively. No significant loss of the analytes was observed at any of the investigated conditions. The current method provides a robust and reliable analytical tool for the above five-probe drug cocktail, and has been successfully verified with known CYP inducers.", 
    "17": "In recent years, evidence has been accumulating indicating a major role of glutamate in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Of particular importance in this regard are the metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRM). Thus, a recently published trial of the amino acid analogue LY2140023, which exerts its effects through the activation of the glutamate receptors GRM3/GRM2, showed an improvement of positive and negative symptoms comparable to treatment with olanzapine. A functional variant of GRM3 has been described which modulates synaptic glutamate levels. We assessed whether this functional variant rs6465084 is related to schizophrenia in a large sample of patients and controls. We found an increased frequency of the A allele (p=0.027) and the AA genotype (p=0.024) in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, in an assessment of schizophrenia endophenotypes, patients of the AA genotype performed poorly in the digit symbol test, a measure of attention (p=0.008). Our results provide further evidence for the potential importance of the glutamate receptor GRM3 in schizophrenia, and indicate that the novel antipsychotic LY2140023 may actually be targeting a pathogenic pathway of schizophrenia.", 
    "18": "Sedation and analgesia are a constant challenging issue in paediatric intensive care units, for ethical reasons among others. Basically, goals and available treatments in that context do not differ from those in adults. For instance, while we propose midazolam as the first choice benzodiazepine, there is no evidence for encouraging the use of one morphinomimetic rather than others in children. On the other hand, numerous paediatric specificities do exist: understanding and expression of pain both different and difficult, presence and involvement of the parents, pain assessment methods, pharmacology, pathologies. It is therefore mandatory to know these specificities to ensure a proper use of evaluation tools and therapeutics. The paucity of strong evidence from the literature does not allow producing definitive consensus guidelines. However, some practices can be highlighted such as the use of written protocol on pain/sedation evaluation and therapeutics adapted to children, literature data and local habits, the training of medical/nursing staff and the constitution of local referring team. A particular attention should be paid to propofol: its use longer than several hours should be strongly discouraged in infants and children due to the risk of Propofol Infusion Syndrome. Further clinical studies should be conducted in an attempt to provide answers to routine, daily issues and questions, for example, how to tailor the level of sedation to the needs of the patient, how to stop it, which drug must be preferred or what place for non-pharmacological approaches.", 
    "19": "Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) is a natural flavone commonly found in many plants including PASSIFLORA COERULEA L. Researchers have performed extensive and detailed investigations on the behavioral and pharmacological effects of chrysin IN VIVO, but there was little information available on the effect of chrysin on nociception. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of chrysin on the nociceptive threshold using the tail-immersion test. Intraperitoneal ( I. P.) injection of chrysin (10, 25, 50, 75, 100 mg/kg) dose- and time-dependently induced a pronounced decrease of the tail withdrawal latencies (TWL), thus characterizing a hyperalgesic effect (ED50 = 65.59 mg/kg). The following results showed that GABAA receptors were involved in the hyperalgesic effects of chrysin. 1) The hyperalgesia induced by chrysin was significantly and dose-dependently blocked by pretreatment with flumazenil (0.75, 1 mg/kg, I. P.), a specific antagonist for benzodiazepine sites associated with GABAA receptors. 2) Bicuculline (2, 4 mg/kg, I. P.), a GABAA receptor antagonist, markedly antagonized the hyperalgesic effect of chrysin in a dose-dependent manner. 3) Picrotoxin (2 mg/kg, I. P.), a chloride channel blocker, could also notably antagonize the hyperalgesia of chrysin. Oral administration of chrysin (75 mg/kg) also produced a hyperalgesic effect in the tail-immersion test. In addition, diazepam (1 mg/kg, I. P.) showed a marked antinociceptive effect, which was completely blocked by flumazenil (1 mg/kg, I. P.). In conclusion, it can be summarized that both I. P. and oral administration of chrysin produced a significant hyperalgesic effect in the tail-immersion test and that the hyperalgesic effect of chrysin may be associated with GABAA receptors.",

Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) effects from racemic citalopram have been described; however, the present report is the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, that describes all the reported abnormalities in a single patient receiving escitalopram. A 52-year-old man with a history of depression treated with escitalopram 10 mg/day, extended-release morphine 30 mg/day and zopiclone 15 mg/day was found unconscious at his home. He was known to have attempted suicide three weeks previously. Partially emptied bottles of escitalopram, morphine, oxycodone, zopiclone, lorazepam and diazepam were found close to the patient. He was transferred to the emergency department, where airway management and other supportive care were initiated. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The initial 12-lead ECG demonstrated junctional rhythm at 48 beats/min, a wide complex escape (145 ms) with right bundle branch morphology and a prolonged corrected QT interval at 650 ms. Cardiac monitoring was undertaken. No ventricular arrhythmias or torsade de pointes were detected. No specific treatment for shortening the QT was implemented. Another 12-lead ECG performed 48 h later demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a normal corrected QT, normal PR interval and normal QRS duration. The effects of the overdose of escitalopram on the ECG and its interactions with other drugs are reviewed.",

Particular practices not commonly associated with prescription drugs were reported, such as sniffing, smoking, and injection. Associated health risks included initiation into injection drug use, polydrug use, drug overdose, and drug dependency. A greater awareness of the potential health risks associated with prescription drug misuse should be incorporated into services that target IDUs, including street outreach, syringe exchanges, and drug treatment.",

Current evidence suggests that dopaminergic dysfunction, impaired iron homeostasis, and genetic predisposition may be involved in the pathophysiology of RLS. Four classes of medications have been used for patients with RLS, but pregnancy elicits a therapeutic concern. Although two dopamine agonists, ropinirole and pramipexole, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of RLS and are currently the first-line treatment for daily symptoms, there is very little information on the teratogenic risks of these new medications. Therefore, they are not currently recommended for use during pregnancy. Medications with a more extensive safety record in pregnancy include opioids; antiepileptics, such as carbamazepine and gabapentin; and certain benzodiazepines. Ruling out iron deficiency should be an integral part of a treatment plan for RLS in pregnancy. Before management with medication is introduced, every patient should be assessed for iron status with measurement of serum ferritin.",

Here a duloxetine overdose case, in combination with other antidepressants and benzodiazepines, is reported and the chemical-clinical correlations discussed; this is probably the first detailed report of such a case. The patient referred to have ingested nine tablets of Cymbalta (more than 500 mg of duloxetine) and high amounts of four other drugs (venlafaxine, trazodone, sertraline and clonazepam). The patient was dozy and confused and some electrolyte imbalances were found. After gastrolavage, toxicological analyses revealed high plasma levels of duloxetine (384 ng/ml) and low levels of the other supposedly involved drugs. The overdose resulted to be not fatal and the outcome was relatively benign, also thanks to the fast emergency assistance. This case suggests that clinicians should be alerted to the possibility of toxic effects caused by simultaneous overdoses of duloxetine and other antidepressants and that caution should be used when prescribing more than one of these drugs to patients at risk of suicide.",

    "44": "A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 9000 ingestions of valproic acid. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected ingestion of valproic acid by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of valproic acid might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of valproic acid ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to the acute ingestion and acute-on-chronic ingestion of immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms of valproic acid, divalproex, and valproate sodium alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This review focuses on the ingestion of more than a single therapeutic dose and the effects of an overdose. Although therapeutic doses of valproic acid can cause adverse effects in adults and children, some idiosyncratic and some dose-dependent, these cases are not considered. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in whom a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who are symptomatic (more than somnolence or exhibiting coma or seizures) after a valproic acid ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Asymptomatic patients with an unintentional acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more or asymptomatic patients who are taking the drug therapeutically and who take an additional single acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more of any valproic acid formulation should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 4) Patients with unintentional ingestions of immediate-release valproic acid formulations, who are asymptomatic, and more than 6 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 5) Patients with unintentional ingestions of delayed-release or extended-release formulations of valproic acid who are asymptomatic, and more than 12 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 6) Pregnant women who ingest below the dose for emergency department referral and do not have other referral conditions should be directed to their primary care obstetrical provider for evaluation of potential maternal and fetal risk. Routine referral to an emergency department for immediate care is not required (Grade D). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade C). 8) Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested valproic acid within the preceding hour (Grade C). Prehospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Poison centers should follow local protocols and experience with its use. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grades D). 9) In patients who have ingested valproic acid and who are comatose, naloxone can be considered for prehospital administration in the doses used for treatment of opioid overdose, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) A benzodiazepine can be administered by EMS personnel if convulsions are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction, expressed by written treatment protocol or policy, or if there is direct medical oversight (Grade C).",

Recently, there has been much research on the interplay between these enzymes and transporter proteins such as P-glycoprotein. Intestinal drug metabolism not only has an effect on drug disposition but also may have a role in protecting the host from xenobiotics. Although there is some information on how both the enzymes and transporters develop in the small bowel with age, there is little information regarding the clinical effects of these changes. In addition to developmental changes, the influence of gastrointestinal disease and nutrition are additional covariates in the intestinal metabolism of drugs.",

Primary and secondary endpoints were mean weight change from baseline and percentage change from baseline in fasting triglyceride levels, respectively.", 
    "52": "At week 16, weight decreased significantly with aripiprazole versus olanzapine (-1.8 vs. +1.41 kg; p < .001). Significant differences in percentage change in triglyceride levels were observed with aripiprazole (decreases) versus olanzapine (increases) at all time-points. In addition, significantly more subjects receiving aripiprazole had clinically relevant (> or = 7%) weight loss versus olanzapine (11.1% vs. 2.6%; p = .038), and a lower percentage of subjects receiving aripiprazole had clinically relevant weight gain (2.5% vs. 9.1%; p = .082). Mean percentage changes in fasting total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at week 16 were significantly different with aripiprazole versus olanzapine, with no significant effects on glycemic laboratory measures. Mean Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scores for both groups were in the range of \"no change\" to \"minimal improvement.\" CGI-I endpoint scores were statistically significantly better with olanzapine (mean +/- SE = 3.09 +/- 0.16) versus aripiprazole (mean +/- SE = 3.74 +/- 0.15; p < .001), and more subjects discontinued aripiprazole (N = 32/88; 36%) than olanzapine (N = 22/85; 26%).",

Seeking health services was associated with female gender (OR=2.0) and the presence of common mental disorders (OR=2.2). 13.3% of the sample (95% CI: 9.2;17.5) said they had used at least one psychotropic drug, especially antidepressives (5.0%) and benzodiazepines (3.1%). In the multivariable analysis, female gender and the presence of common mental disorders remained associated with the use of benzodiazepines. Per capita income presented a direct and independent association with the use of psychoactive drugs: the greater the income, the greater the use of these drugs was.",

GABA sensitivity (lower in receptors containing gamma1 or gamma2S subunits) and the potentiation of GABA-activated chloride currents (I(GABA)) by benzodiazepines (BZDs) are dependent on gamma2S(gamma1) incorporation. A variable gamma subunit incorporation may affect the estimation of I(GABA) potentiation by BZDs. We propose an approach for estimation of BZD efficiency that accounts for mixed population of alpha1beta2 and alpha1beta2gamma2S(gamma1) receptors.",

    "72": "Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) behavior is an experimental methodology to study reward and motivational effects. We have established a paradigm to evaluate enhancing motivation by drugs in the runway method using the priming stimulation of ICSS. In the present study, we investigated the effects of diazepam on the experimental extinction process of non-reinforcing reward and pre-trial electric priming stimulations in lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation. The extinction process in the runway method consisted of these 15 trials. Diazepam, an anti-anxiety drug, at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg (i.p.) delayed the extinction of running behavior when priming stimulation was given. The GABAergic antagonist flumazenil at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (i.p.) totally prevented the effect of diazepam. These results demonstrate that diazepam delays the extinction of running behavior on ICSS in the runway method and flumazenil, a GABAergic antagonist, eliminates the delayed effect of diazepam, that is, indicating that the delayed extinction effect of diazepam may be related to facilitation of motivation, which was promoted via the GABAergic system in the ICSS behavior.", 
    "73": "In this study, we compared the effects of Type I benzodiazepine receptor-selective agonists (zolpidem, quazepam) and Type I/II non-selective agonists (zopiclone, triazolam, nitrazepam) with either an ultra-short action (zolpidem, zopiclone, triazolam) or long action (quazepam, nitrazepam) on motor coordination (rota-rod test) and muscle relaxation (traction test) following the recovery from thiopental-induced anesthesia (20 mg/kg) in ddY mice. Zolpidem (3 mg/kg), zopiclone (6 mg/kg), and triazolam (0.3 mg/kg) similarly caused an approximately 2-fold prolongation of the thiopental-induced anesthesia. Nitrazepam (1 mg/kg) and quazepam (3 mg/kg) showed a 6- or 10-fold prolongation of the anesthesia, respectively. Zolpidem and zopiclone had no effect on the rota-rod and traction test. Moreover, zolpidem did not affect motor coordination and caused no muscle relaxation following the recovery from the thiopental-induced anesthesia. However, zopiclone significantly impaired the motor coordination at the beginning of the recovery. Triazolam significantly impaired the motor coordination and muscle relaxant activity by itself, and these impairments were markedly exacerbated after the recovery from anesthesia. Nitrazepam and quazepam significantly impaired motor coordination, and the impairments were exacerbated after the recovery. These results suggest that the profile of recovery of motor coordination and muscle flaccidity after co-administration of benzodiazepine-receptor agonists and thiopental is related to the half-life and selectivity for the benzodiazepine-receptor subtypes.", 
    "74": "Anxiolytic-like effects of some short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotics were examined with experimental paradigms of anxiety using an elevated plus-maze in male ICR mice. Diazepam was used as a positive control. The drug at a dose of 1 mg/kg significantly increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms and percentage of the number of open arm entries in the elevated plus-maze. Triazolam, brotizolam, rilmazafone, and lormetazepam also showed an anxiolytic-like effect as indicated by the significant increase in the percentage of time spent in the open arms and percentage of the number of open arm entries. Effects of short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotics used in the study were more potent than those of diazepam. In addition, the doses affecting the elevated plus-maze by benzodiazepine hypnotics were much smaller than those that showed muscle-relaxant activity measured by the rotarod test, indicating that anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics had high specificity and selectivity.", 
    "75": "Status epilepticus (SE) induces a number of events leading to programmed cell death (PCD). The aim of our work is to study the time sequence of activation of different factors in experimental SE (intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) model). We studied ceramide, a known mediator of apoptosis in multiple models, sphingomyelinases (SMases), enzymes that break down sphingomyelin and increase ceramide thus leading to apoptosis in many models, Bcl(2), Bax, and caspase-3. SE induced a sustained ceramide increase starting 2h after kainic acid injection followed by an increase in Bax protein at 6 and 12h, and the appearance of caspase-3-activated fragment (caspase-3a) immunostaining and TUNEL positivity at 12h. Status epilepticus also induced an increase in acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases that preceded (acidic sphingomyelinase) and parallelled (acidic and neutral sphingomyelinase) the increases in ceramide. These data suggest that, in this model, Bax is activated early in the process and that its increase is sustained till 12h after kainic acid injection which is the time of first appearance of caspase-3 activation and TUNEL positivity, and that SMases contribute to increases in ceramide levels during and after status epilepticus.",

Treatment of CSE aims to minimise the length of seizures, treat the causes, and reduce adverse outcomes; however, there is a paucity of data on the treatment of childhood CSE. We report the findings from a systematic, population-based study on the treatment of community-onset childhood CSE.", 
    "77": "We collected data prospectively on children in north London, UK, who had episodes of CSE (ascertainment 62-84%). The factors associated with seizure termination after first-line and second-line therapies, episodes of CSE lasting for longer than 60 min, and respiratory depression were analysed with logistic regression. Analysis was per protocol, and adjustment was made for repeat episodes in individuals.", 
    "78": "182 children of median age 3.24 years (range 0.16-15.98 years) were included in the North London Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Childhood Surveillance Study (NLSTEPSS) between May, 2002, and April, 2004. 61% (147) of 240 episodes were treated prehospital, of which 32 (22%) episodes were terminated. Analysis with multivariable models showed that treatment with intravenous lorazepam (n=107) in the accident and emergency department was associated with a 3.7 times (95% CI 1.7-7.9) greater likelihood of seizure termination than was treatment with rectal diazepam (n=80). Treatment with intravenous phenytoin (n=32) as a second-line therapy was associated with a 9 times (95% CI 3-27) greater likelihood of seizure termination than was treatment with rectal paraldehyde (n=42). No treatment prehospital (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.5) and more than two doses of benzodiazepines (OR 3.6, 1.9-6.7) were associated with episodes that lasted for more than 60 min. Treatment with more than two doses of benzodiazepines was associated with respiratory depression (OR 2.9, 1.4-6.1). Children with intermittent CSE arrived at the accident and emergency department later after seizure onset than children with continuous CSE did (median 45 min [range 11-514 min] vs 30 min [5-90 min]; p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test); for each minute delay from onset of CSE to arrival at the accident and emergency department there was a 5% cumulative increase in the risk of the episode lasting more than 60 min.",

    "80": "At excitatory synapses, glutamate released from neurons is taken up by glial cells and converted to glutamine, which is cycled back to neurons. Alterations in this system are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, but they have not been characterized in vivo. We examined the glutamine/glutamate ratio and levels of other metabolites in acute mania and schizophrenia in this exploratory study.", 
    "81": "Data were obtained from 2 x 2 x 2 cm voxels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and parieto-occipital cortex (POC) using two-dimensional J-resolved proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 4 Tesla and analyzed using LCModel. Fifteen bipolar disorder patients with acute mania and 17 schizophrenia patients with acute psychosis were recruited from an inpatient unit; 21 matched healthy control subjects were also studied. Glutamine/glutamate ratio and N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline, and myo-inositol levels were evaluated in a repeated measures design. Medication effects and relationship to demographic and clinical variables were analyzed.", 
    "82": "Glutamine/glutamate ratio was significantly higher in ACC and POC in bipolar disorder, but not schizophrenia, compared with healthy control subjects. N-acetylaspartate was significantly lower in the ACC in schizophrenia. Patients on and off lithium, anticonvulsants, or benzodiazepines had similar glutamine/glutamate ratios.", 
    "83": "The elevated glutamine/glutamate ratio is consistent with glutamatergic overactivity and/or defective neuronal-glial coupling in acute mania, although medication effects cannot be ruled out. Abnormalities in glutamatergic neurotransmission and glial cell function in bipolar disorder may represent targets for novel therapeutic interventions.", 
    "84": "Electrical synapses play an important role in signaling between neurons and the synaptic connections between many neurons possess both electrical and chemical components. Although modulation of electrical synapses is frequently observed, the cellular processes that mediate such changes have not been studied as thoroughly as plasticity in chemical synapses. In the leech (Hirudo sp), the competitive AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX inhibited transmission at the rectifying electrical synapse of a mixed glutamatergic/electrical synaptic connection. This CNQX-mediated inhibition of the electrical synapse was blocked by concanavalin A (Con A) and dynamin inhibitory peptide (DIP), both of which are known to inhibit endocytosis of neurotransmitter receptors. CNQX-mediated inhibition was also blocked by pep2-SVKI (SVKI), a synthetic peptide that prevents internalization of AMPA-type glutamate receptor. AMPA itself also inhibited electrical synaptic transmission and this AMPA-mediated inhibition was partially blocked by Con A, DIP and SVKI. Low frequency stimulation induced long-term depression (LTD) in both the electrical and glutamatergic components of these synapses and this LTD was blocked by SVKI. GYKI 52466, a selective non-competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors, did not affect the electrical EPSP, although it did block the glutamatergic component of these synapses. CNQX did not affect non-rectifying electrical synapses in two different pairs of neurons. These results suggest an interaction between AMPA-type glutamate receptors and the gap junction proteins that mediate electrical synaptic transmission. This putative interaction between glutamate receptors and gap junction proteins represents a novel mechanism for regulating the strength of synaptic transmission.", 
    "85": "Delirium occurs at rates ranging from 10% to 30% of all hospital admissions. It is a negative prognostic indicator, often leading to longer hospital stays and higher mortality. The aetiology of delirium is multifactorial and many causes have been suggested. The stress-diathesis model, which posits an interaction between the underlying vulnerability and the nature of the precipitating factor, is useful in understanding delirium. Preventing delirium is the most effective strategy for reducing its frequency and complications. Environmental strategies are valuable but are often underutilized, while remedial treatment is usually aimed at specific symptoms of delirium. Antipsychotics are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment and have been shown to be effective in treating symptoms of both hyperactive and hypoactive delirium, as well as generally improving cognition. Haloperidol is considered to be first-line treatment as it can be administered via many routes, has fewer active metabolites, limited anticholinergic effects and has a lower propensity for sedative or hypotensive effects compared with many other antipsychotics. Potential benefits of atypical compared with typical antipsychotics include the lower propensity to cause over-sedation and movement disorder. Of the second-generation antipsychotics investigated in delirium, most data support the use of risperidone and olanzapine. Other drugs (e.g. aripiprazole, quetiapine, donepezil and flumazenil) have been evaluated but data are limited. Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice (in addition to antipsychotics) for delirium that is not controlled with an antipsychotic (and can be used alone for the treatment of alcohol and sedative hypnotic withdrawal-related delirium). Lorazepam is the benzodiazepine of choice as it has a rapid onset and shorter duration of action, a low risk of accumulation, no major active metabolites and its bioavailability is more predictable when it is administered both orally and intramuscularly.",

    "87": "On day 1, ethanol was injected into the rat's right striatum (ST) using a stereotaxic operative procedure. On day 3, head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for surgically treated rats were performed to evaluate ethanol injury morphologically. On day 4, dynamic PET scans (17 injured rats and 7 non-injured controls) were performed for 60 min with an animal PET scanner under chloral hydrate anesthesia following a bolus injection of [(11)C]PK-11195 through tail vein. Because PBRs are present throughout the brain, there is no suitable receptor-free reference region. The reference tissue model may not be applicable because of low target to background ratio for low affinity of [(11)C]PK-11195 to PBRs. We evaluated the PBRs binding with regions of interest (ROIs)-based approach to estimate total distribution volume (V). We used an integral from 0 min to 60 min (V (60)) as an estimate of V. On the coronal PET image, ROIs were placed on bilateral ST. Differences in right/left ST V (60) ratios between lesioned and unlesioned control rats were compared using unpaired t tests. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for confirming the presence of activated microglia following decapitation on the PET experiment day.", 
    "88": "The right/left ST V (60) ratios in lesioned rats (1.07 +/- 0.08) were significantly higher than those in unlesioned control rats (1.00 +/- 0.06, P < 0.05). On immunohistochemical staining, activated microglia were exclusively observed in the injured right ST but not in the noninjured left ST of the injury rats and the bilateral ST of the non-injured control rats.",

    "90": "Several species of Passiflora have been employed widely as a folk medicine because of sedative and tranquillizer activities. In this study, we evaluate the effects on anxiety and memory process of two popularly used Passiflora species. To this aim, male Wistar rats (weighing 250-300 g) were intraperitoneally injected with the aqueous extract of Passiflora alata or Passiflora edulis (25, 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg; single injection) 30 minutes prior to the elevated plus-maze test, inhibitory avoidance test, or habituation to an open-field apparatus. The effects of both species of Passiflora were compared with that of diazepam (1 mg/kg), a standard anxiolytic drug. Our findings revealed that, similar to diazepam, the treatment with P. alata (100 and 150 mg/kg) and P. edulis (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg) induced anxiolytic-like effects in rats. Memory was not affected by the treatment with any dose of P. alata or P. edulis, but diazepam disrupted memory process in rats. Phytochemical analysis showed that the content of flavonoids of the aqueous extract of P. edulis is almost twice that of P. alata. These differences in contents of flavonoids could explain the lower active doses of the aqueous extract of P. edulis in inducing anxiolytic-like effects compared to P. alata. In conclusion, our findings suggest that, distinct from diazepam, the aqueous extract of both species of Passiflora induced anxiolytic-like effects in rats without disrupting memory process.", 
    "91": "The management of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) is a difficult, but challenging task. Early and efficient treatment may influence long-term clinical outcome. Atypical antipsychotics (A-AP) are commonly prescribed in this population, but few data exist to establish their appropriate usage in the management of FEP. Our purpose is to review the literature and to summarize current data on the prescription of A-AP in FEP.", 
    "92": "Studies assessing efficacy or safety of A-AP in FEP were identified by searches in Medline (up to April 2006). The following nine drugs were considered for this review: clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zotepine, and sertindole.", 
    "93": "Only four A-AP (clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) were evaluated as treatment of FEP. All of them show the same efficacy as conventional antipsychotics (C-AP). Clozapine has no benefit over C-AP in the treatment of naive patients. It entails a high rate of treatment discontinuation because of the need for regular white blood cell monitoring explained by the risk of agranulocytosis. Hence, clozapine may not be a first-line treatment of FEP. Tolerance to quetiapine and olanzapine is better than C-AP regarding extrapyramidal side effects, but weight gain induced by these two A-AP may be very disabling in a young population. Considering results from head-to-head comparative studies, olanzapine may be more effective than risperidone when an affective component is associated with the FEP symptomatology, but more data are needed to demonstrate this point. Risperidone is a relatively well-tolerated compound when it is prescribed at doses lower than 4 mg/d. It is the only A-AP that showed greater efficacy than C-AP to prevent relapse in patients with FEP. Unfortunately, information regarding the preventive efficacy of the other A-AP are lacking.", 
    "94": "Further studies, particularly longer-term studies, are needed to explore the impact of A-AP prescription in FEP on the course of psychotic disorders. The common use of A-AP as treatment of FEP is justified by a relatively better tolerance compared to C-AP, and by the hypothesis-not demonstrated-of a better effect on long-term outcome.",

This phenomenon is associated with a reduced ability of CA3 to respond to entorhinal cortex inputs. Here, we describe a lesion that destroys the perforant path in CA3 after status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection in 8-week-old rats. Using magnetic resonance imaging, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analyses, we determined that this lesion develops after 30 minutes of SE and is characterized by microhemorrhages and ischemia. After a longer period of SE, the lesion invariably involves the upper blade of the dentate gyrus. Adult rats treated with subcutaneous diazepam (20 mg kg for 3 days) did not develop the dentate gyrus lesion and had less frequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (p < 0.01). Young (3-week-old) rats rarely (20%) developed the CA3 lesion, and their spontaneous seizures were delayed (p < 0.01). To investigate the role of the damaged CA3 in seizure activity, we reinduced SE in adult and young epileptic rats. Using FosB/DeltaFosB markers, we found induction of FosB/DeltaFosB immunopositivity in CA3 neurons of young but not in adult rats. These experiments indicate that SE can produce a focal lesion in the perforant path that may affect the roles of the hippocampus in epileptic rats.",

Midazolam and propofol are the agents most commonly used for sedation in ICU. The quality of the sedation is quite comparable with both agents, but pharmacokinetic properties of propofol allow a more rapid weaning process from mechanical ventilation. However, implementation of algorithms to adjust drug dosages reduces ventilator days and limits the kinetic differences between propofol and midazolam. Among the adverse events associated with propofol, propofol infusion syndrome is a rare but lethal aspect of propofol therapy. Opioids are the mainstay of analgesic therapy. They interact synergistically with hypnotics. Sufentanil, fentanyl and morphine are the most frequently used opioids.

    "125": "Menthol and related compounds were investigated for modulation of recombinant human gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A), alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s)) receptor currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Sub-maximal (EC(20)) GABA currents were typically enhanced by co-applications of 3-300 microM (+)-menthol (e.g. by approximately 2-fold at 50 microM) > isopulegol > isomenthol> alpha-terpineol > cyclohexanol. We studied menthol's actions on GABA(A) receptors compared to sedatives (benzodiazepines) and intravenous anesthetics (barbiturates, steroids, etomidate and propofol). Flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) did not inhibit menthol enhancements while currents directly activated by 50 microM propofol were significantly inhibited (by 26+/-3%) by 50 microM (+)-menthol. GABA(A) receptors containing beta(2) subunits with either a point mutation in a methionine residue to a tryptophan at the 286 position (in transmembrane domain 3, TM-3) or a tyrosine to a tryptophan at the 444 position (TM-4) are insensitive to modulation by propofol. Enhancements of GABA EC(20) currents by menthol were equally abolished in GABA(A) alpha(1)beta(2)(M286W)gamma(2s) and alpha(1)beta(2)(Y444W)gamma(2s) receptors while positive modulations by benzodiazepines, barbiturates and steroids were unaffected. Menthol may therefore exert its actions on GABA(A) receptors via sites distinct from benzodiazepines, steroids and barbiturates, and via sites important for modulation by propofol. Finally, using an in vivo tadpole assay, addition of (+)-menthol resulted in a loss of righting reflex with an EC(50) of 23.5+/-4.7 microM (approximately10-fold less potent anesthesia than propofol). Thus, menthol and analogs share general anesthetic action with propofol, possibly via action at similar sites on the GABA(A) receptor.",

Cholinergic facilitation of hippocampal LTP in the behaving rat is a useful model for the study of the effects of anticholinesterase or other drugs on synaptic plasticity. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded from the hippocampal CA1 region following excitation of the basal dendrites in behaving male Long-Evans rats. LTP was induced by a high-frequency train (200 Hz for 0.5s duration) following injection of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor eserine sulfate (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), specific muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (21.2 microg/microl, i.c.v.), or saline (i.p. or i.c.v.). Pirenzepine was found to block basal-dendritic LTP when LTP was induced during walking, but not when LTP was induced during immobility. Eserine facilitated LTP when induction occurred during either immobility or walking. The present study demonstrates that an anticholinesterase enhances LTP in CA1 of the behaving rat, and that facilitation of basal-dendritic LTP during walking is mediated by muscarinic M1 receptors.",

A protocol was developed where rats could freely explore an OF that was physically connected to an EPM and a LDB during 15min. Classical anxiety- and locomotion-related behaviors from each test were measured. Lewis and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) inbred strains, known to present genetic differences in each of the individual tests, differed for all anxiety-related behaviors from the combined apparatus. Factor analyses revealed that similar anxiety- and locomotion-related factors were produced by the three tests applied either separately or in combination. Under both conditions, each test produced its own anxiety-related factor. Two benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (at 5 and 10mg/kg) and midazolam (at 0.75mg/kg), facilitated the approach towards the EPM open arms, whereas pentylenetetrazole (10mg/kg) specifically inhibited exploration of the three aversive areas (OF center, EPM open arms, LDB light compartment).

    "151": "Levetiracetam (LEV) has been considered to undergo no significant change in bioavailability during pregnancy; however, it was recently demonstrated to display modifications leading to a drop in its serum level. We describe a patient who displayed impending status epilepticus following a fall in her LEV level during the first trimester. The oral LEV dosage was increased, and phenytoin and benzodiazepines were transiently prescribed. She experienced severe anxiety and an unbearable fear over the deleterious consequences for her baby despite repeated, reassuring explanations. Her anxiety was so strong that she aborted electively shortly after leaving the hospital. This observation emphasizes the need for LEV level monitoring during pregnancy to prevent unexpected seizure relapses. The rapid increase in levetiracetam dosage in parallel with the loss of seizure control is suspected of facilitating the induction of significant psychiatric changes.", 
    "152": "Two case reports of patients suffering from burning mouth syndrome (BMS), a type of somatoform disorder, who were treated with olanzapine are discussed. One case was a 54-year-old female with BMS who failed to respond to milnacipran treatment. Olanzapine (2.5 mg/day) brought about dramatic improvement in the patient's symptoms, and thereafter milnacipran withdrawal further eliminated her symptoms. The second case was a 51-year-old male with BMS who failed to respond to paroxetine treatment. Olanzapine (2.5 mg/day) was added to the treatment regimen and increased to 5.0 mg/day the following week. The patient noted a reduction in symptoms and continued to live normally thereafter without experiencing severe symptoms. These findings suggest that olanzapine may be useful in the treatment of BMS.",

Patients were consecutively attending different programs from March 2005 to October 2006. Prior to enrollment in the study, patients were either antipsychotic-naive (37.9%, N = 25) or had been taking an antipsychotic drug for fewer than 30 days. Significant weight gain was defined as a > or = 0.5 increase in body mass index (BMI) z score (adjusted for age and gender) at 6 months. Based on recent criteria for pediatric populations, patients were considered \"at risk for adverse health outcome\" if they met at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) > or = 85th BMI percentile plus presence of 1 or more negative weight-related clinical outcomes, or (2) > or = 95th BMI percentile.",

The number of patients at risk for adverse health outcome increased from 11 (16.7%) to 25 (37.9%) (p = .018). The latter increase was significant only in the olanzapine group (p = .012). Total cholesterol levels increased significantly in patients receiving olanzapine (p = .047) and quetiapine (p = .016). Treatment with quetiapine was associated with a significant decrease in free thyroxin (p = .011).",

    "158": "Leptin regulates energy expenditure and body weight by acting both on the hypothalamus and on peripheral targets. Central actions of leptin are enhanced by cholecystokinin (CCK). The interaction between leptin and CCK makes physiological sense, as rats lacking CCK1 receptors are resistant to peripheral leptin but not to leptin directly infused into the brain. We have recently reported that CCK enhances leptin effects by increasing the entry of leptin into the CNS. The aim of this work was to further characterize the effect of CCK (10 microg kg(-1)) on leptin kinetics as well as the CCK receptor subtype involved in the interaction between CCK and leptin.", 
    "159": "Experiments were carried out both in free-feeding and in fasted rats receiving a single dose of leptin (100 microg kg(-1); i.p.). Parameters analysed over the next 6 h were plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of leptin.",

    "162": "At our Institute, during the last decade, the incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) appears to be on the increase among pediatric patients treated with BU-thiotepa (BU-TTP)-conditioning regimen. We thus performed a retrospective analysis to identify the risk factors for HVOD, which could explain such a change. In total, 116 patients treated at Institut Gustave Roussy, between May 1998 and December 2005 were eligible for this study having received BU-TTP as their first high-dose chemotherapy regimen, followed by autologous hematopoietic SCT (AHSCT). According to McDonald's clinical criteria, HVOD was diagnosed in 31% of these children. Demographic, clinical, biological and therapeutic parameters were evaluated in uni- and multivariate analyses that showed a significant correlation between previous carboplatin therapy and risk of developing post transplant HVOD (P=0.028). Comparable results were found for etoposide (P=0.048). In addition, a correlation between HVOD and risk of post transplant death was linked to its association with other types of organ failure (P=0.029). This study demonstrates that previous VPCARBO administration in conventional chemotherapy significantly increases the risk of HVOD among brain tumor patients later consolidated with BU-TTP followed by AHSCT.",

No significant differences were found between (non)abstinents regarding any of six categories of mental disorder and medical conditions (yes/no) and no significant differences were found in any self - evaluation regarding the participation in different kinds of after-care. A greater number of patients continued to abstain from alcohol if they continued in aftercare 24 months after the end of intensive treatment.", 
    "166": "Patients with different somatic and mental co-occurring disorders did not differ in abstinence rate. However, membership in after-care 24 months after the end of intensive therapy significantly contributed to the abstinence rate.

    "169": "There were no differences in objective or subjective measures.", 
    "170": "Our hypothesis that patients with alcohol dependence would have less slowing of their eye movements in response to this challenge, reflecting reduced GBzR sensitivity, was not confirmed. The reasons for this could mean that GBzR function returns to normal with abstinence, or that this paradigm is unable to measure the subtle subtype-specific changes in GBzR sensitivity that occur following dependent alcohol use.", 
    "171": "We investigated the mechanism underlying the anxiolytic actions of the neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) with an elevated plus-maze test. In mice, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of N/OFQ (0.1 and 0.32 nmol) led to an increase in time spent in the open arms (anxiolytic-like effects). A non-peptidyl N/OFQ receptor (NOP) antagonist, J-113397(1-{(3R,4R)-1-cyclooctylmethyl-3-hydroxymethyl-4-piperidyl}-3-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one), (1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg, s.c.) blocked the increase induced by N/OFQ. On the other hand, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and a GABAA receptor antagonist, (+)-bicuculline, (5.6 mg/kg, i.p.) also inhibited the increase induced by N/OFQ. In rats, microinfusions of N/OFQ (10 and 32 pmol) into the amygdala led to an increase in time spent in the open arms. However, intracranial infusions of N/OFQ (10-100 pmol) into the dorsal hippocampus did not affect the time spent in the open arms. These findings suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of N/OFQ may be related to the GABA/benzodiazepine system in the amygdala.",

    "175": "Two (OLZ-ODT and RIS-OS) by five (0-, 15-, 30-, 45- and 60-min time points) repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed only a significant main effect of time course on PANSS-EC (F=82.2, P<.0001). No differences in the number of patients receiving additional injection due to worsening were found (OLZ-ODT, 11.8%; RIS-OS, 9.4%). No differences in rate of extrapyramidal symptoms and patient satisfaction with assigned treatment were found. However, patients in the OLZ-ODT group recovered significantly more from tachycardia than those in the RIS-OS group (t=2.17, P=.03).", 
    "176": "OLZ-ODT and RIS-OS treatments yielded similar improvements in acutely agitated patients who accepted oral medication. However, on one physiological parameter (i.e., tachycardia) OLZ-ODT might be superior to RIS-OS. Physiological indicators may also be useful for measuring levels of agitation.", 
    "177": "Benzodiazepines are known to produce amnesia by involvement of GABAergic system and by interference of long term potentiation (LTP). In this study, we examined effect of Bacopa monniera on downstream molecules of LTP after diazepam-induced amnesia in mice. We used a Morris water maze scale for evaluating the effect of Bacopa monniera after screening for muscle coordination by rota rod. The index of acquisition and retrieval was recorded as escape latency time (ELT). Behavioral results showed that Bacopa monniera (120 mg kg(-1) oral) significantly reversed diazepam- (1.75 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced amnesia in Morris water maze task. The molecular studies revealed that diazepam upregulated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), while it downregulated nitrite, nitrate, total nitrite, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression, phosphodiesterase, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) without affecting calmodulin levels. Bacopa monniera suppressed the diazepam induced upregulation of MAP kinase, pCREB and iNOS and attenuated the downregulation of nitrite. It did not affect the cAMP, PDE, nitrate, total nitrite, total CREB level. These behavioral findings displayed the reversal of diazepam-induced amnesia by Bacopa monniera without qualifying the molecular details although some downstream molecules of LTP may be involved.", 
    "178": "Stiripentol (STP) has been used as co-therapy for treatment of epilepsy for many years. Its mechanism of action has long been considered to be indirect, as it inhibits the enzymes responsible for metabolism of other anti-convulsant agents. However, a recent report suggested that STP might also act at the neuronal level, increasing inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. We examined the effect of STP on the functional properties of recombinant GABA(A) receptors (GABARs) and found that it was a positive allosteric modulator of these ion channels. Its activity showed some dependence on subunit composition, with greater potentiation of alpha3-containing receptors and reduced potentiation when the beta1 or epsilon subunits were present. STP caused a leftward shift in the GABA concentration-response relationship, but did not increase the peak response of the receptors to a maximal GABA concentration. Although STP shares some functional characteristics with the neurosteroids, its activity was not inhibited by a neurosteroid site antagonist and was unaffected by a mutation in the alpha3 subunit that reduced positive modulation by neurosteroids. The differential effect of STP on beta1- and beta2/beta3-containing receptors was not altered by mutations within the second transmembrane domain that affect modulation by loreclezole. These findings suggest that STP acts as a direct allosteric modulator of the GABAR at a site distinct from many commonly used anti-convulsant, sedative and anxiolytic drugs. Its higher activity at alpha3-containing receptors as well as its activity at delta-containing receptors may provide a unique opportunity to target selected populations of GABARs.",

UV detector (lambda=230 nm) was used. The calibration curves were linear in the concentration range of 2-800 ng mL(-1) for diazepam and 2-200 ng mL(-1) for the three metabolites (r(2)>0.99). The lower limit of quantification was 2 ng mL(-1) for all analytes. Within and between-day precisions in the measurement of QC samples were in the range of 1.8-18.0% for all analytes.

In the first eight months, sedation was achieved using continuous infusions of a benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam or midazolam) and an opioid (fentanyl or sufentanil). In the following eight months, sedation using a propofol-remifentanil combination was given and adapted by the nurses according to the Ramsay score and a pain scale. The main endpoint was the time to extubation (from the cessation of sedation to extubation). The secondary endpoints were the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, the ICU mortality rate, the need of vasopressive support, the occurrence of self-extubations and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP).",

The time to extubation was shorter in the second period (10 versus 92h, p<0.0001). The duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in ICU, the mortality rate, the need for vasopressor support and the occurrence of VAP were similar. Five self-extubations occurred in the second period versus one in the first one (p=0.02).",

    "184": "The current study focused on the development of an automated IC50 cocktail assay in a miniaturized 384 well assay format. This was developed in combination with a significantly shorter high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) run-time; than those currently reported in the literature. The 384-well assay used human liver microsomes in conjunction with a cocktail of probe substrates metabolized by the five major CYPs (tacrine for CYP1A2, diclofenac for CYP2C9, (S)-mephenytoin for CYP2C19, dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and midazolam for CYP3A4). To validate the usefulness of the automated and analytical methodologies, IC50 determinations were performed for a series of test compounds known to exhibit inhibition across these five major P450s. Eight compounds (sertraline, disulfuram, ticlopidine fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ketoconazole, miconazole, paroxetine, flunitrazepam) were studied as part of a cocktail assay, and against each CYPs individually. The data showed that the IC50s generated with cocktail incubations did not differ to a great extent from those obtained in the single probe experiments and hence unlikely to significantly influence the predicted clinical DDI risk. In addition the present method offered a significant advantage over some of the existing cocktail analytical methodology in that separation can be achieved with run times as short as 1 min without compromising data integrity. Although numerous studies have been reported to measure CYP inhibition in a cocktail format the need to support growing discovery libraries not only relies on higher throughput assays but quicker analytical run times. The current study reports a miniaturized high-throughput cocktail IC50 assay, in conjunction with a robust, rapid resolution LC-MS/MS end-point offered increased sample throughput without compromising analytical sensitivity or analyte resolution.",

Use was monitored using the Danish registration system, Ordiprax, which monitors sales of prescription medicine. Two Danish general practices, comprising a patient base of approximately 2300 were studied. With the exception of the severely physically or mentally ill, all users of BZD and CP were included.", 
    "188": "After 2\u00bd years, the use of BZD and CP was reduced by 75% and 90%, respectively. The reorganization of prescription patterns was seen to be significantly easier than physicians had expected. During the first three months, only four to five additional visits per week per 1000 patients were required. Subsequently, this number was stabilized at one to two additional visits. The usual collaborative partners, such as psychiatrists, homecare services, hospitals and substance abuse units were essentially not deployed. No serious withdrawal effects arose.",

    "190": "Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most frequent neurological emergencies with an incidence of 20/100,000 per year and a mortality between 3% and 40% depending on etiology, age, SE type and duration. Generalized convulsive forms of SE (GTCSE), in particular, require aggressive treatment. Presently, only 55-80% of cases of GTCSE are controlled by initial therapy. Therefore, there is a need for new options for the treatment of SE. Here we review the current standard treatment including recent advances and provide a summary of preclinical and clinical data regarding treatment options which may become available in the near future. The initial treatment of SE usually consists of a benzodiazepine (preferably lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg) followed by phenytoin or fosphenytoin or valproic acid (where approved for SE therapy). With intravenous formulations of levetiracetam, available since 2006, and lacosamide, which is expected for autumn of 2008, new treatment options have become available, that should be evaluated in prospective controlled trials. If SE remains refractory, the induction of general anaesthesia using propofol, midazolam, thiopental, or pentobarbital is warranted in GTCSE.",

We therefore conducted a case series of qualitative interviews with buprenorphine injectors in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to examine further the issues surrounding buprenorphine injection as well as the abuse of midazolam in combination with buprenorphine. Interviews with 19 men do not suggest significant adverse health consequences from buprenorphine injection alone and injectors have adapted diverted buprenorphine as a treatment modality. A subset of these injectors, however, combined buprenorphine and midazolam for euphoric effects with resultant symptoms of a possible pharmacological interaction. Prospective cohort studies, rather than hospital-derived samples, are needed to better understand the safety of buprenorphine injection.",

    "200": "The concepts of partial recovery and remission have become increasingly important for the evaluation of the effectiveness of schizophrenia therapeutics. The relationship of baseline symptoms and changes in symptoms to remission of psychosis was evaluated. Fifty-six outpatients with residual schizophrenia completed a double-blind trial of olanzapine versus haloperidol and were then enrolled into a one-year open-label trial of olanzapine. Out of these 56 subjects, 13 (23%) met remission criteria at the beginning of the open-label treatment and were excluded. During the one-year study, 7/43 (16%) subjects met remission criteria. These subjects had significantly lower baseline ratings for tardive dyskinesia (TD) than subjects who did not achieve remission (1.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.2 +/- 4.6, P = 0.03). As expected, remitted subjects had significantly greater improvements in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total scores, positive subscale scores and scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms total scores. Remitted subjects also experienced a significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms (P = 0.001), activation (P = 0.005), and Clinical Global Impressions scores (P < 0.001), as well as greater improvements in extrapyramidal symptoms (P = 0.007) and TD (P < 0.001). These results suggest that the relationship of depressive symptoms and improved side effects to the construct of remission in schizophrenia may deserve special attention. Future studies should aim to relate remission criteria to functional outcomes, cognition, and other important symptom domains.", 
    "201": "The lupane type pentacyclic triterpenes: lupeol, betulin, and betulinic acid are widely distributed natural compounds. Recently, pharmaceutical compositions from plant extracts (family Marcgraviaceae) containing betulinic acid, have been patented as anxiolytic remedies. To extend our knowledge of the CNS effects of the triterpenes, we suggest here that the chemically related lupeol, betulin and betulinic acid may interact with the brain neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in vitro and in vivo. Using radioligand receptor-binding assay, we showed that only betulin bound to the GABA(A)-receptor sites in mice brain in vitro and antagonised the GABA(A)-receptor antagonist bicuculline-induced seizures in mice after intracisternal and intraperitoneal administration. Neither betulinic acid nor lupeol bound to GABA(A) receptor nor did they inhibit bicuculline-induced seizures in vivo. These findings demonstrate for the first time the CNS effects of betulin in vivo, and they also show distinct GABA(A)-receptor-related properties of lupane type triterpenes. These findings may open new avenues in understanding the central effects of betulin, and they also indicate possibilities for novel drug design on the basis of betulin structure.", 
    "202": "Severe tetanus is characterised by muscle spasms and autonomic dysfunction. We recently reported the results of a randomised placebo controlled trial of magnesium sulphate infusions for the treatment of severe tetanus which showed magnesium was associated with improved muscle spasm and cardiovascular control. We hypothesised that magnesium controlled autonomic dysfunction by reducing catecholamine release and thus urinary excretion. Urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were measured during the first 24 h of therapy in 180 adults with severe tetanus randomised to treatment with magnesium (n = 92) or placebo (n = 88). Magnesium therapy was associated with lower urinary adrenaline excretion and higher urinary noradrenaline excretion. High urinary adrenaline concentrations were associated with documented autonomic dysfunction. Patients given magnesium had significantly less autonomic dysfunction, required less cardiovascular stabilising drugs, and had lower urinary concentrations of adrenaline. These findings suggest adrenaline is important in the pathophysiology of severe tetanus and magnesium controls autonomic dysfunction by reducing adrenaline release.", 
    "203": "Physiological urinary continence depends on many factors that are potentially vulnerable to adverse drug effects, which may lead to incontinence. In principle, drugs could cause incontinence by lowering bladder outlet resistance and/or by increasing intravesical pressure, which disrupts the normal pressure relationship between the bladder and urethra and leads to urinary leakage; other possibilities include disturbances of central nervous control of voiding or an overproduction of urine. While many drug groups could theoretically induce urinary incontinence based upon pathophysiological considerations, evidence demonstrating a cause-effect relationship between drug usage and incontinence is sparse. Drug classes in which induction of incontinence has been proposed include alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. However, other drug classes are not innocent in terms of causing urinary incontinence and physicians are well advised to closely monitor patients for the occurrence of incontinence after new prescriptions and/or major dosage changes.",

CYP2C19 was genotyped for the allelic variants CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, and CYP2C19*17. Analysis of omeprazole, hydroxyomeprazole, omeprazole sulfone, and midazolam in plasma was carried out by LC-MS/MS.", 
    "206": "The volunteers genotyped as CYP2C19*1*17, CYP2C19*17*17, CYP2C19*1*1 (n = 8), or CYP2C19*17*2 (n = 1) presented a median hydroxylation index (omeprazole/hydroxyomeprazole) of 1.35, indicating that all of them were extensive metabolizers of CYP2C19. The volunteers (n = 9) presented a 0.12 log of the omeprazole/sulfone ratio and a median oral clearance of midazolam of 17.89 ml min(-1) kg(-1), suggesting normal CYP3A activity.", 
    "207": "Orthogonal regression analysis between midazolam clearance and log of the plasma concentrations of the omeprazole/omeprazole sulfone ratio (R = -0.7544, P < 0.05) suggests that both midazolam and omeprazole can be used as markers of CYP3A activity in the population investigated.", 
    "208": "Pharmacological agents used in the treatment of anxiety have been reported to decrease threat relevant processing in patients and healthy controls, suggesting a potentially relevant mechanism of action. However, the effects of the anxiolytic diazepam have typically been examined at sedative doses, which do not allow the direct actions on emotional processing to be fully separated from global effects of the drug on cognition and alertness.", 
    "209": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a lower, but still clinically effective, dose of diazepam on emotional processing in healthy volunteers.", 
    "210": "Twenty-four participants were randomised to receive a single dose of diazepam (5 mg) or placebo. Sixty minutes later, participants completed a battery of psychological tests, including measures of non-emotional cognitive performance (reaction time and sustained attention) and emotional processing (affective modulation of the startle reflex, attentional dot probe, facial expression recognition, and emotional memory). Mood and subjective experience were also measured.", 
    "211": "Diazepam significantly modulated attentional vigilance to masked emotional faces and significantly decreased overall startle reactivity. Diazepam did not significantly affect mood, alertness, response times, facial expression recognition, or sustained attention.", 
    "212": "At non-sedating doses, diazepam produces effects on attentional vigilance and startle responsivity that are consistent with its anxiolytic action. This may be an underlying mechanism through which benzodiazepines exert their therapeutic effects in clinical anxiety.", 
    "213": "Insomnia and depression are frequently encountered in patients during withdrawal from substances. While there are no approved medications for treating them, off-label attempts to address these phenomena with mirtazapine have shown some promising results. This case describes the use of mirtazapine as an aid in benzodiazepine withdrawal and its potential benefits in alleviating insomnia and depression in a 32-year-old man. It was found to ameliorate sleep myoclonus that was thought to be associated with his withdrawal syndrome. It is hoped this report will generate interest and stimulate further research in this area of psychopharmacology."
