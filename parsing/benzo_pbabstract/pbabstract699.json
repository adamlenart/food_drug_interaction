    "0": "1 (+/-)-10-(3-Dimethylamino-2-methylpropyl)-2-valeroylphenothiazine hydrochloride (M & B 18,706) has been compared with dimethothiazine, chloropromazine, diazepam and baclofen for potency in reducing decerebrate rigidity in the cat and rat and for activity in causing ataxia or sedation.2 When given intravenously M & B 18,706 had seven times the potency of dimethothiazine and one-half the potency of chlorpromazine in reducing the rigidity of the intercollicular decerebrate cat. When administered orally M & B 18,706 and chlorpromazine were equi-potent in reducing rigidity but M & B 18,706 was less effective than chlorpromazine in producing ataxia in this species.3 In the rat, M & B 18,706 had one-quarter the potency of chlorpromazine for reducing decerebrate rigidity but had from 1/20th to 1/200th its potency in tests for sedative or tranquillizing activity.4 M & B 18,706, like dimethothiazine and chlorpromazine, had little effect on the rigidity of ischaemic decerebrate cats and failed to inhibit polysynaptic spinal reflexes.5 M & B 18,706 had intravenous potency comparable to chlorpromazine in reducing the pressor action of noradrenaline in the spinal cat.", 
    "1": "An active approach to the management of severe pre-eclampsia is outlined using sedation with diazepam, hypotensive therapy with hydralazine and immediate steps to terminate the pregnancy.Clinical experience with 80 cases is described. There was no maternal loss and corrected perinatal mortality was 4.8%.", 
    "2": "A case of paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis is described. A hitherto unreported response to l-dopa is recorded and its possible relevance to the pathophysiology of the disorder is discussed.", 
    "3": "Following the administration of diazepam to mothers in labour the clinical effects, changes in thermogenesis, and metabolism of the drug in the newborn were observed under carefully controlled conditions. A total maternal dose of 30 mg or less in the 15 hours before delivery had little effect on the infants' state. Larger doses, however, were accompanied by low Apgar scores at birth, apnoeic spells, hypotonia, reluctance to feed, and an impaired metabolic response to a cold stress. Measurement of plasma levels of diazepam and its active metabolite showed that both products were detectable in significant concentrations in some infants for up to eight days. We conclude that greater care should be taken in the use of this otherwise effective drug for the treatment of pre-eclampsia."
