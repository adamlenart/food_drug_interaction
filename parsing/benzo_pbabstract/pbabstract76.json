Participants were 174 consecutive subjects included in a first episode programme with no prior treatment with antipsychotic medication. Patients were assigned to haloperidol, olanzapine or risperidone in a randomized, open-label, prospective clinical trial. The main outcome variable was the remission criteria developed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group. Clinical variables were included in a logistic regression analysis in order to predict the remission state at 1 year. At 1 year, 31% of patients met criteria for remission. The logistic regression analysis revealed that the strongest predictors of achieving clinical remission 1 year away from a first episode of non-affective psychosis were the length of duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), the severity of negative symptomatology and the educational level attained at baseline. The results suggest that: (1) patients with a lengthy DUP, a greater severity of negative symptomatology at baseline and with a lower education level are in a higher risk of not achieving a clinical remission during the first year of treatment; and (2) early intervention clinical programs should aim to reduce the length of DUP in order to provide a better outcome for patients.",

    "2": "Protocol 1: A total of 120 SD rats (60 males, 60 females), weighing 200-300 g, were randomly assigned into 4 groups with equal males and females: lipid (L), midazolam (M) and propofol (P) and control (C). Rats were pretreated with 10 ml/kg lipid intravenously in group L, saline and 0.23 mg/kg midazolam (10 ml/kg in volume) sequentially in group M, saline and 4 mg/kg propofol (10 ml/kg in volume) in group P and saline 10 ml/kg in group C. Then ropivacaine 44 mg/kg (0.75%) was injected intraperitoneally into each rat. The convulsion rate in each group and the time of convulsion after ropivacaine injection were observed. Meanwhile, the plasma concentration of ropivacaine at the time of convulsion was measured. Protocol 2: Additional 100 male SD rats were used for the measurements of ropivacaine LD50 with different pretreatments including lipid, midazolam, propofol and saline through the up-and-down method. Rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups similarly as protocol 1. The doses of ropivacaine in each group were determined according to our pilot study and 6 dosage levels with the same interval ratio 8.5 was applied in each group. The doses of these pretreatment drugs and administration methods were similarly as protocol 1.",

As an alternative to traditional multistep sequential syntheses, we designed routes employing one-pot MCRs to accelerate access diverse BDZ scaffolds in two or three steps.", 
    "6": "Previously, we have shown that chronic treatment with allopregnanolone (ALLO) for three months impaired learning function in the Swe/PS1 mouse model. ALLO is a neurosteroid, produced in the CNS and a GABAA receptor agonist. ALLO modulates the general inhibitory system in the CNS by enhancing the effect of GABA. Chronic treatment with other GABAA receptor active compounds, such as benzodiazepines, ethanol and medroxy-progesterone acetate has been associated to cognitive decline and/or increased risk for dementia. In this study, we sufficed with a treatment period of one month for the Swe/PS1 mouse, and included another Alzheimer's disease mouse model; the Swe/Arc model. We found that one month of chronic treatment with elevated ALLO levels within physiological range impaired learning and memory function in the Swe/Arc female and male mice. Male Swe/PS1 mice also showed marginally impaired function, while the female mice did not. Furthermore, the chronic ALLO treatment caused increased levels of soluble A\u03b2 in the Swe/PS1 mouse model while the levels were unchanged in the Swe/Arc model. Therefore, both Swe/Arc and Swe/PS1 mice showed signs of accelerated disease progression. Still, further studies are required to determine the mechanisms behind the cognitive impairment and the increased A\u03b2-levels caused by mildly elevated ALLO-levels.",

Adult parrots (n=9) were administered either midazolam (2 mg/kg) or an equal volume of saline solution intranasally before a 15-minute manual restraint in a complete crossover study. Respiratory rate and sedation scores were recorded before and during capture and during and after 15 minutes of manual restraint. Heart rate and cloacal temperature were recorded during manual restraint. After restraint, the parrots received intranasal flumazenil (0.05 mg/kg) or an equal volume of saline solution, and the recovery time was recorded. In those birds that received midazolam, sedation was observed within 3 minutes of administration, and vocalization, flight, and defense responses were significantly reduced during capture. During manual restraint, the mean rate of cloacal temperature increase was significantly slower and remained significantly lower in birds that received midazolam compared with controls. Mean respiratory rates were significantly lower for up to 12 minutes in parrots that received midazolam compared with those receiving saline solution. Flumazenil antagonized the effects of midazolam within 10 minutes. No overt clinical adverse effects to intranasal midazolam and flumazenil administration were observed. Further studies on the safety of intranasal midazolam and flumazenil in this species are warranted.",

Midazolam showed the highest cytotoxicity. HL-60 cells were the most sensitive to midazolam, followed by epidermal keratinocytes, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), glioblastoma and then oral normal cells. Midazolam did not induce the production of apoptosis markers such as internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, but did induce the appearance of many vacuoles, mitochondrial swelling and cell membrane rupture in OSCC cell lines (HSC-2 and HSC-4) cells. The cytotoxicity of midazolam was not reduced by pre-treatment with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1).",

Hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint,h) of six CYP3A4 substrates (alprazolam, clonazepam, diltiazem, midazolam, nifedipine, and quinidine), covering a wide range of clearance, in monkeys correlated well with that cited in literature for humans (R = 0.90) with a simple equation of Y = 0.165X (Y: human CLint,h, X: monkey CLint,h, represented in mL/min/kg). 3. To verify the predictability of human CLint,h, monkey CLint,h of a test set of CYP3A4 substrates cited in literature (dexamethasone, nifedipine, midazolam, quinidine, tacrolimus, and verapamil) was applied to the equation and human CLint,h was calculated. The human CLint,h of all the substrates was predicted within 3-fold error (fold error: 0.35-2.77). 4. The predictability of human CLh by our method was superior to common in vivo prediction methods (allometry and liver blood flow method). These results suggest that human hepatic clearance of CYP3A4 substrates can be predicted by applying cynomolgus monkey CLint,h obtained following intravenous administrations in each laboratory to the simple equation.",

Few studies were undertaken in circumstances that reflect real world practice, and, with notable exceptions, most were small and carried considerable risk of bias.Compared with placebo, more people in the haloperidol group were asleep at two hours (2 RCTs, n = 220, risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.95). Dystonia was common (2 RCTs, n = 207, RR 7.49, CI 0.93 to 60.21). Compared with aripiprazole, people in the haloperidol group required fewer injections than those in the aripiprazole group (2 RCTs, n = 473, RR 0.78, CI 0.62 to 0.99). More people in the haloperidol group experienced dystonia (2 RCTs, n = 477, RR 6.63, CI 1.52 to 28.86).Despite three larger trials with ziprasidone (total n = 739), data remain patchy, largely because of poor design and reporting. Compared with zuclopenthixol acetate, more people who received haloperidol required more than three injections (1 RCT, n = 70, RR 2.54, CI 1.19 to 5.46).Three trials (n = 205) compared haloperidol with lorazepam. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to the number of participants asleep at one hour (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.05, CI 0.76 to 1.44). However, by three hours, significantly more people were asleep in the lorazepam group compared with the haloperidol group (1 RCT, n = 66, RR 1.93, CI 1.14 to 3.27). There were no differences in numbers requiring more than one injection (1 RCT, n = 66, RR 1.14, CI 0.91 to 1.43).Haloperidol's adverse effects were not offset by addition of lorazepam (e.g. dystonia 1 RCT, n = 67, RR 8.25, CI 0.46 to 147.45; required antiparkinson medication RR 2.74, CI 0.81 to 9.25). Addition of promethazine was investigated in one larger and better graded trial (n = 316). More people in the haloperidol group were not tranquil or asleep by 20 minutes (RR 1.60, CI 1.18 to 2.16). Significantly more people in the haloperidol alone group experienced one or more adverse effects (RR 11.28, CI 1.47 to 86.35).

Where additional drugs to offset the adverse effects are available, sole use of haloperidol for the extreme emergency, in situations of coercion, could be considered unethical. Addition of the sedating promethazine has support from better-grade evidence from within randomised trials. Use of an alternative antipsychotic drug is only partially supported by fragmented and poor-grade evidence. Evidence for use of newer generation antipsychotic alternatives is no stronger than that for older drugs. Adding a benzodiazepine to haloperidol does not have strong evidence of benefit and carries a risk of additional harm.After six decades of use for emergency rapid tranquillisation, this is still an area in need of good independent trials relevant to real world practice.",

The proportion of participants with no clinically important response did not significantly differ between those given benzodiazepines or placebo (N = 382, 6 RCTs, RR 0.67 CI 0.44 to 1.02). The results from the various rating scales applied to assess global and mental state were inconsistent.Fourteen studies examined benzodiazepine monotherapy in comparison with antipsychotic monotherapy.

Desired sedation occurred significantly more often among participants in the benzodiazepine group than in the antipsychotic group at 20 and 40 minutes. No significant between-group differences could be identified for global and mental state or occurrence of adverse effects.Twenty trials compared benzodiazepine augmentation of antipsychotics with antipsychotic monotherapy. Referring to clinically important response, statistically significant improvement could be demonstrated only for the first 30 minutes of augmentation treatment (30 minutes: 1 RCT, N = 45, RR 0.38 CI 0.18 to 0.80; 60 minutes: N = 45,1 RCT, RR 0.07 CI 0.00 to 1.13; 12 hour: N = 67,1 RCT, RR 0.85 CI 0.51 to 1.41; pooled short-term studies: N = 511, 6 RCTs, RR 0.87 CI 0.49 to 1.54).

Low-quality evidence suggests that benzodiazepines are effective for very short-term sedation and could be considered for calming acutely agitated people with schizophrenia. Measured by the overall attrition rate, the acceptability of benzodiazepine treatment appears to be adequate. Adverse effects were generally poorly reported. High-quality future research projects with large sample sizes are required to clarify the evidence of benzodiazepine treatment in schizophrenia, especially regarding long-term augmentation strategies.",

People allocated to fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate had fewer relapses than those given bromperidol decanoate (n = 77, RR 3.92 Cl 1.05 to 14.60, NNH 6 CI 2 to 341). People allocated bromperidol decanoate required additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate, but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.72 CI 0.7 to 4.2). The use of benzodiazepine drugs was very similar in both groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.68 to 1.70). People left the bromperidol decanoate group more frequent than those taking other depot preparation due to any cause (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 2.17 CI 1.00 to 4.73). Anticholinergic adverse effects were equally common between bromperidol and other depots (n = 47, RR 3.13 CI 0.7 to 14.0) and additional anticholinergic medication was needed with equal frequency in both depot groups, although results did tend to favour the bromperidol decanoate group (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.64 to 1.01). The incidence of movement disorders was similar in both depot groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.47 to 1.17).", 
    "59": "Minimal poorly reported trial data suggests that bromperidol decanoate may be better than placebo injection but less valuable than fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. If bromperidol decanoate is available it may be a viable choice, especially when there are reasons not to use fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. Well-conducted and reported randomised trials are needed to inform practice.", 
    "60": "In mammals, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission in the amygdala is particularly important for controlling levels of fear and anxiety. Most GABA synthesis in the brain is catalyzed in inhibitory neurons from L-glutamic acid by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67). In the current study, we sought to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear in mice with knocked down expression of the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD67 in the amygdala using a lentiviral-based (LV) RNA interference strategy to locally induce loss-of-function. In vitro experiments revealed that our LV-siRNA-GAD67 construct diminished the expression of GAD67 as determined with western blot and fluorescent immunocytochemical analyses. In vivo experiments, in which male C57BL/6J mice received bilateral amygdala microinjections, revealed that LV-siRNA-GAD67 injections produce significant inhibition of endogenous GAD67 when compared with control injections. In contrast, no significant changes in GAD65 expression were detected in the amygdala, validating the specificity of LV knockdown. Behavioral experiments showed that LV knockdown of GAD67 results in a deficit in the extinction, but not the acquisition or retention, of fear as measured by conditioned freezing. GAD67 knockdown did not affect baseline locomotion or basal measures of anxiety as measured in open field apparatus. However, diminished GAD67 in the amygdala blunted the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam (1.5 mg kg(-1)) as measured in the elevated plus maze. Together, these studies suggest that of GABAergic transmission in amygdala mediates the inhibition of conditioned fear and the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam in adult mice.", 
    "61": "In the framework of the DRUID (Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines) EU-6 project, a roadside survey was performed in South-East Hungary to determine the incidence of alcohol and the most frequent illicit and licit drug consumption (amphetamines, THC, illicit and medical opiates, cocaine, ketamine, benzodiazepines, zopiclone and zolpidem) in the general driving population. All 3110 drivers stopped between 01 January 2008 and 31 December 2009 were checked for alcohol, and among them 2738 persons (87.7%) participated in the further examinations, on a voluntary basis. Licit and illicit drugs were determined from their oral fluid samples by GC-MS analysis. Illicit drugs were detected in 27 cases (0.99%), licit drugs in 85 cases (3.14%), and alcohol (cut off: 0.1g/l) was found in 4 (0.13%) cases. Illicit drug consumption was the highest among men of the ages 18-34, during the spring, and on the week-end nights. With respect to licit drugs, the highest incidence was found among women over the age of 50, during the summer, and on the week-days. All alcohol positive cases were men over the age of 35. In comparison to international European averages, the alcohol and illicit drug consumption was low, but the licit drug consumption was over the European average.", 
    "62": "The abrupt discontinuation of prolonged benzodiazepine treatment elicits a withdrawal syndrome with increased anxiety as a major symptom. The neural mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine physical dependence are still insufficiently understood. Flumazenil, the non-selective antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors was capable of preventing and reversing the increased anxiety during benzodiazepine withdrawal in animals and humans in some, but not all studies. On the other hand, a number of data suggest that GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b1(1) subunits are critically involved in processes developing during prolonged use of benzodiazepines, such are tolerance to sedative effects, liability to physical dependence and addiction. Hence, we investigated in the elevated plus maze the level of anxiety 24 h following 21 days of diazepam treatment and the influence of flumazenil or a preferential \u03b1(1)-subunit selective antagonist \u03b2CCt on diazepam withdrawal syndrome in rats. Abrupt cessation of protracted once-daily intraperitoneal administration of 2 mg/kg diazepam induced a withdrawal syndrome, measured by increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze 24 h after treatment cessation. Acute challenge with either flumazenil (10mg/kg) or \u03b2CCt (1.25, 5 and 20 mg/kg) alleviated the diazepam withdrawal-induced anxiety. Moreover, both antagonists induced an anxiolytic-like response close, though not identical, to that seen with acute administration of diazepam. These findings imply that the mechanism by which antagonism at GABA(A) receptors may reverse the withdrawal-induced anxiety involves the \u03b1(1) subunit and prompt further studies aimed at linking the changes in behavior with possible adaptive changes in subunit expression and function of GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "63": "The anxiolytic-like effects of topiramate were assessed during several estrous cycle phases in Wistar rats tested in two animal models of anxiety-like behavior. In a conflict operant test, during proestrus, diazepam (1.3, 2.0mg/kg; P<0.05) or topiramate (20.0, 30.0mg/kg; P<0.05) increased the number of immediately punished responses. During metestrus-diestrus only the highest doses of diazepam (2.0mg/kg, P<0.05) or topiramate (30.0mg/kg, P<0.05) increased the number of immediately punished reinforcers. Similar results were obtained in the elevated plus-maze test: during proestrus, diazepam (1.3, 2.0mg/kg; P<0.05) or topiramate (20.0, 30.0mg/kg; P<0.05) produced anxiolytic-like actions. During metestrus-diestrus only the highest doses of diazepam (2.0mg/kg, P<0.05) or topiramate (30.0mg/kg, P<0.05) produced anxiolytic-like actions. Neither diazepam nor topiramate nor estrous cycle phases significantly modified the number of closed arm entries in the elevated plus-maze test. It is concluded that the response to neuromodulatory drugs for anxiety-like behavior varied according to the estrous cycle phases.",

Blood samples were analyzed for alcohol, 17 medicinal drugs and 8 illicit psychoactive substances and/or their metabolites by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in injured drivers admitted to the emergency departments of five hospitals in Belgium between January 2008 and May 2010 and in drivers randomly selected between January 2008 and September 2009. Three hundred and seventy-seven seriously injured drivers and 2750 roadside respondents were selected. In the roadside survey, out of the 203 concentrations above DRUID (Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines) cut-offs for medicinal drugs, 51% were in the therapeutic range, 46% infratherapeutic, and 2.5% supratherapeutic. In the seriously injured drivers, out of the 78 concentrations above DRUID cut-offs for medicinal drugs, these percentages were respectively 63%, 33%, and 4%. Significant differences were found in the distribution of concentrations for opioids, benzodiazepines, and Z-drugs. For the latter, while in the seriously injured drivers study most concentrations were therapeutic, in the roadside survey most were infratherapeutic. The opposite was observed for the opioids. Eight and 41% of the roadside respondents and injured drivers, respectively, had an alcohol concentration above 0.1 g/L, with higher concentrations found in the injured drivers. For illicit drugs, significant differences were found for amphetamine and cocaine, for which respectively lower and higher concentrations were observed in the blood samples taken in the roadside survey.", 
    "74": "The widely used antipsychotic drug, olanzapine (OLA) shows large interindividual variability in metabolic clearance. Although the role of the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and UGT1A4 has been extensively explored, little is known about the in vivo role of flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) catalyzing the N-oxidation of OLA in vitro. We investigated the influence of FMO1 and 3 polymorphisms on the steady state serum concentrations of OLA and its N-oxide metabolite in 379 patients. The upstream FMO1*6 was associated with increased dose-adjusted serum OLA concentrations (C/Ds; P=0.008), an effect further enhanced by FMO1rs7877C>T in smokers. The influence of FMO3 polymorphisms was limited to variability in OLA N-oxide. Homozygous carriers of FMO3rs2266780A>G (p.E308G) displayed 50% lower C/D of OLA N-oxide compared with subjects homo- or heterozygous for the A-variant (P<0.003). Our data support the role of FMO3 in the N-oxidation of OLA and implicate for the first time the contribution of FMO1 and its functional *6 variant in OLA disposition.",

    "81": "Thermo-sensitive gels containing lorazepam microspheres were developed and characterized for intranasal brain targeting. Pluronics (PF-127 and PF-68) have been selected since they are thermo-reversible polymers with the property of forming a solution at low temperatures (4-5 \u00b0C), and a gel at body temperature (37 \u00b0C). This property makes them an interesting material to work with, especially in case of controlled release formulations. The present study focuses on the development of an intranasal formulation for lorazepam, as an alternative route of drug delivery to the brain. Direct transport of drugs to the brain circumventing the brain barrier, following intranasal administration, provides a unique feature and better option to target brain. The presence of mucoadhesive microspheres in the gel vehicle via nasal route can achieve a dual purpose of prolonged drug release and enhanced bioavailability. To optimise the microsphere formulation, Box Behnken design was employed by investigating the effect of three factors, polymer concentration (chitosan), emulsifier concentration (Span 80) and cross-linking agent (glutaraldehyde) on the response variable which is the mean particle size. The concentration of 21% PF-127 and 1% PF-68 were found to be promising gel vehicles. The results showed that the release rate followed a prolonged profile dispersion of the microspheres in the viscous media, in comparison to the microspheres alone. Histopathological studies proved that the optimised formulation does not produce any toxic effect on the microscopic structure of nasal mucosa.",

In pediatric burn injury, DEX has been shown to be safe as a long-term sedative in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, comparison of DEX with traditional sedatives, such as midazolam, for sedation in pediatric burn injury has not been performed. The purpose of this study was to compare DEX with midazolam in terms of sedation, efficacy, and side effects in children with burn injury. A retrospective review of all children with a TBSA burn injury \u226520% admitted from December 2008 to September 2010 was performed. Children who received a continuous DEX infusion were compared with children receiving a continuous midazolam infusion. Data collected included: age, TBSA burn, ventilator days, ICU days, hypotensive episodes, bradycardic episodes, and Richmond Agitation Score (RAS). A total of 21 patients who received DEX infusions were compared with 21 age-matched and burn size-matched patients who received midazolam infusions. Of the 21 DEX patients, nine also received midazolam infusions, eight prior to DEX and one after. These patients did not receive DEX and midazolam simultaneously. There was no difference in age (6.9 vs 6.4 years), TBSA (45.5 vs 49.2%), ICU days (45.3 vs 55.4), and ventilator days (38.5 vs 45.5) between the DEX and midazolam patients, respectively. The mean duration of infusion was 22.5 \u00b1 24.9 days for DEX and 20.1 \u00b1 24.8 days for midazolam. DEX patients had a mean RAS of -0.91 \u00b1 0.8. Midazolam patients were more sedated with a mean RAS of -1.33 \u00b1 0.7. Only one episode of bradycardia was noted in the DEX group. The DEX group had fewer hypotensive episodes (mean arterial pressure <60 mm Hg) while on infusion compared with the midazolam group (15.8 vs 29.7 episodes). Thus, it can be surmised that DEX is a safe and effective sedative for pediatric burn patients. Compared to midazolam, DEX may provide more effective sedation and less sedation-related hypotension.",

The DrugCheck Waive RT cups showed false negative results for barbiturates and opiates, but no false positives. Overall, the NexScreen cup demonstrated better sensitivity than claimed, whereas the sensitivity of the DrugCheck Waive RT cup did not meet claims.",

Dispensing of anxiolytics remained largely unchanged, while sedatives and typical antipsychotics decreased by 26.4% and 61.2%, respectively. Lithium dispensing remained static while valproate and lamotrigine increased markedly. In 2011, antidepressants accounted for 66.9% of total psychotropic DDDs/1000/day totals, far greater than anxiolytics (11.4%), antipsychotics (7.3%), mood stabilisers (5.8%), sedatives (5.5%), or ADHD medications (3.0%).

In total, 29 rats underwent 2 consecutive (11)C-flumazenil PET scans, each one lasting 30 min. The tracer was mixed with different amounts of isotopically unmodified flumazenil (4, 20, 100, or 400 \u03bcg) to cover a wide range of receptor occupancies during the scan.

B(max) was decreased by 12% in kainate-treated rats, compared with controls. The radiotracer equilibrium dissociation constant, K(D), was similar in both rat groups and all brain regions and was estimated as 5.9 \u00b1 0.9 ng x mL(-1). There was no difference in flumazenil transport across the blood-brain barrier between control and kainate-treated rats, and the effect of tariquidar treatment was similar in both rat groups.

    "94": "Treatment of the positive psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia with standard antipsychotic drugs (APDs) is ineffective in a proportion of cases. For these treatment resistant patients the alternative is the APD clozapine which is superior to other agents but carries serious side effects. Why clozapine is uniquely effective is unknown, but we have previously postulated may involve G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (ErbB1) transactivation signaling to the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK-ERK) cascade. This was based upon clozapine induced initial down-regulation and delayed ErbB1 mediated activation of the cortical and striatal ERK response in vivo distinct from other APDs. This study investigated if modulation of the ErbB1-ERK1/2 pathway by clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol affected expression of the ERK substrates p90RSK and c-Fos, factors that regulate transcription of proteins associated with neuroplasticity and synapse formation in C57Bl/6 mice. In cortex and striatum, acute clozapine treatment induced biphasic p90RSK phosphorylation via MEK that paralleled ERK phosphorylation independent of EGF receptor blockade. By contrast, olanzapine and haloperidol caused p90RSK phosphorylation that was not concomitant with ERK signaling over a 24-hour period. For c-Fos, clozapine elevated expression 24h after administration, a timeframe consistent with ERK activation at 8h. Alternatively, haloperidol stimulation of c-Fos levels limited to the striatum was in accord with direct transcriptional regulation through ERK. The unique spatio-temporal expression of downstream nuclear markers of the ErbB1-ERK pathway invoked by clozapine may contribute to its effectiveness in treatment resistant schizophrenia.", 
    "95": "We have previously demonstrated benzodiazepine binding in the cortex and hippocampus of mu-opioid receptor knockout (KO) mice. It is known that benzodiazepine receptors are involved in regulating anxiety-like behaviors. Thus, the present study was designed to examine whether there are changes in anxiety-like behavior in mice lacking mu-opioid receptors. To produce anxiolytic activity (less anxiety), the prototype benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered in wild type (WT) and mu-opioid receptor KO mice. We found that compared to WT mice, mu-opioid receptor KO mice showed enhanced anxiolytic activity to CDP, including increased number of entries into open arm, increased percentage of the time spent in open arms, and decreased percentage of the time spent in enclosed arms in the elevated plus-maze test. We also assessed protein expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthetic enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase; GAD). Western blotting data indicated that neither the lack of mu-opioid receptors nor CDP treatment altered cortical or hippocampal GAD\u2086\u2085 or GAD\u2086\u2087 protein expression. These data indicate that compared with WT, mu-opioid receptor KO mice experienced less anxiety and exhibited enhanced anxiolytic activity to CDP treatment, and these effects were not dependent on GAD\u2086\u2085 or GAD\u2086\u2087 protein expression. Our previous and present data suggest that the anxiolytic activity displayed in mu-opioid receptor KO mice is associated with upregulation of the benzodiazepine receptor system.",

Schizophrenia patients randomly assigned to haloperidol and olanzapine treatment underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3, 6, and 12 months. The caudate and hippocampus were represented as medial representations (M-reps); mesh structures derived from automatic segmentations of high resolution MRIs. Two quantitative shape measures were examined: local width and local deformation. A novel nonparametric statistical method, adjusted exponentially tilted (ET) likelihood, was used to compare the shape measures across the three groups while controlling for covariates. Longitudinal shape change was not observed in the hippocampus or caudate when the treatment groups and controls were examined in a global analysis, nor when the three groups were examined individually. Both baseline and repeated measures analysis showed differences in local caudate and hippocampal size between patients and controls, while no consistent differences were shown between treatment groups. Regionally specific differences in local hippocampal and caudate shape are present in schizophrenic patients. Treatment-related related longitudinal shape change was not observed within the studied timeframe. Our results provide additional evidence for disrupted cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits in schizophrenia.",

The study was a part of the EU 6th framework program DRUID (Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines). Blood samples were screened for 30 illegal and legal psychoactive substances and metabolites as well as ethanol. Danish legal limits were used to evaluate the frequency of drivers violating the Danish legislation while limit of quantification (LOQ) was used for monitoring positive drivers. Tramadol is not included in the Danish legislation therefore the general cut off, as decided in the DRUID project was used. Overall, ethanol (18%) was the most frequently identified compound (alone or in combination with other drugs) exceeding the legal limit, which is 0.53g/l in Denmark. The percentage of seriously injured drivers testing positive for medicinal drugs at levels above the Danish legal limit was 6.8%. Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs (6.4%) comprised the majority of this group. One or more illegal drugs (primarily amphetamines and cannabis) were found to be above the Danish legal limit in 4.9% of injured drivers. Young men (median age 31 years) were over-represented among injured drivers who violated Danish law for alcohol and drugs. Diazepam (4.4%), tramadol (3.2%), and clonazepam (3.0%) were the medicinal drugs most frequently detected at levels above LOQ, whereas amphetamines (5.4%) (amphetamine [5.2%] and methamphetamine [1.5%]), tetrahydrocannabinol (3.7%), and cocaine (3.3%), including the metabolite benzoylecgonine, were the most frequently detected illegal drugs. A driver could be positive for more than one substance; therefore, percentages are not mutually exclusive. Poly-drug use was observed in 112 (13%) seriously injured drivers. Tramadol was detected above DRUID cutoffs in 2.1% of seriously injured drivers. This is 3.5 times that observed in a Danish survey of randomly selected drivers. Moreover, illegal and medicinal drug levels above the Danish legal limit were present more than 10 times as frequently as in injured drivers, whereas ethanol was present more than 30 times as frequently than in randomly selected drivers. The results indicate that there is an increased risk in traffic when driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs, especially alcohol in young male drivers.",

Forced degradation studies were performed on the pure drugs of escitalopram oxalate and clonazepam, as per the stress conditions prescribed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) using acid, base, oxidation, thermal stress and photolytic degradation to show the stability-indicating power of the method. Significant degradation was observed during acid and alkaline hydrolysis and no degradation was observed in other stress conditions. The chromatographic method was optimized using the samples generated from forced degradation studies. Good resolution between the peaks corresponded to the active pharmaceutical ingredients, escitalopram oxalate and clonazepam, and degradation products from the analyte were achieved on an ODS Hypersil C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm) using a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of acetonitrile-50 mM phosphate buffer + 10 mM triethylamine (70:30, v/v). The detection was conducted at 268 nm. The limit of detection and the limit of quantitation for escitalopram oxalate and clonazepam were established. The stress test solutions were assayed against the qualified working standards of escitalopram oxalate and clonazepam, which indicated that the developed LC method was stability-indicating.

The volatile alkaloids (50-200\u2009mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally), without having a muscle relaxant effect, caused a significant increase in the time the animals spent in an unsecured and putatively dangerous area when compared with the control group but had no effect on the number of crossings between the light/dark compartments. In addition to this anxiolytic activity, a significantly antidepressant-like effect was apparent at all tested doses, which was not due to an increase in locomotive activity. The anthranilates administered on their own did not induce sleep in mice but significantly prolonged the diazepam-induced sleep, in a dose-dependent way, suggesting an interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex.",

In adult rats, repeated olanzapine (OLZ) treatment causes an enhanced disruption of avoidance response (sensitization), whereas repeated clozapine (CLZ) treatment causes a decreased disruption (tolerance). The present study addressed (1) whether OLZ sensitization and CLZ tolerance can be induced in adolescent rats, and (2) the extent to which OLZ sensitization and CLZ tolerance induced in adolescence persists into adulthood. Male adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats (approximate postnatal days (\u223cP) 43-47) were first treated with OLZ (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously (sc)) or CLZ (10 or 20 mg/kg, sc) daily for 5 consecutive days in the CAR model. They were then tested for the expression of OLZ sensitization or CLZ tolerance either in adolescence (\u223cP 50) or after they matured into adults (\u223cP 76 and 92) in a challenge test during which all rats were injected with either a lower dose of OLZ (0.5 mg/kg) or CLZ (5.0 mg/kg). When tested in adolescence, rats previously treated with OLZ showed a stronger inhibition of CAR than those previously treated with vehicle (ie, sensitization). In contrast, rats previously treated with CLZ showed a weaker inhibition of CAR than those previously treated with vehicle (ie, tolerance). When tested in adulthood, the OLZ sensitization was still detectable at both time points (\u223cP 76 and 92), whereas the CLZ tolerance was only detectable on \u223cP 76, and only manifested in the intertrial crossing. Performance in the prepulse inhibition and fear-induced 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in adulthood were not altered by adolescence drug treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that atypical antipsychotic treatment during adolescence can induce a long-term specific alteration in antipsychotic effect that persists into adulthood despite the brain maturation. As antipsychotic drugs are being increasingly used in children and adolescents in the past two decades, findings from this study are important for understanding the impacts of adolescent antipsychotic treatment on the brain and behavioral developments. This work also has implications for clinical practice involving adolescence antipsychotic treatments in terms of drug choice, drug dose, and schedule.",

In particular, they may shed light on the circumstances of death in ambiguous and criminal cases. To address the need for information on current autopsy practices, forensic autopsy rates in two counties in Central Norway over the period 2007-2009 were assessed. To investigate toxicological findings that could possibly remain undisclosed without the performance of an autopsy, the impact of alcohol and drugs in forensic autopsy cases from this material was evaluated. The total forensic autopsy rate in this material was 3%. The forensic autopsy rates were low for natural deaths (1%), accidental falls (12%) and the heterogeneous category \"other accidents\" (21%), relatively high for accidental poisonings (84%), and less than adequate for road traffic accidents (57%). For suicides the forensic autopsy rate was 63%, and for recognized homicides 100%. The total forensic autopsy rate was higher for men than for women (5% vs. 2%), and decreased with age, being 38% in the age group <30 years, 23% in the age group 30-59 years, and 1% in the age group >59 years. Despite that Norwegian legislation and regulations regarding forensic autopsy requests are national, the forensic autopsy rates were generally lower in the county of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag than in S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag, with most striking differences in suicide deaths (11% vs. 91%) and road traffic accidents (46% vs. 67%).

Of the forensic autopsy cases where toxicological analysis was performed (361 of 364 cases) a total of 71% had positive toxicology results; 12% were positive for alcohol only, 44% were positive for drugs only, and 15% were positive for both alcohol and drugs. The toxicology results suggest that alcohol and drugs are important factors in sudden unexpected deaths, and that a thorough and comprehensive toxicological analysis is called for when investigating these deaths. Mean BAC in alcohol positive forensic autopsy cases was 1.7\u2030 (median 1.6\u2030, range 0.29-4.1\u2030). The average number of substances detected in toxicology positive cases was 2.6 (median 2, range 1-10). The by far most frequently detected classes of substances were (1) benzodiazepines, (2) opioids and (3) alcohol.", 
    "149": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic compound of the Cannabis sativa, has been reported to have central therapeutic actions, such as antipsychotic and anxiolytic effects. We have recently reported that Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs) present a deficit in social interaction that is ameliorated by atypical antipsychotics. In addition, SHRs present a hyperlocomotion that is reverted by typical and atypical antipsychotics, suggesting that this strain could be useful to study negative symptoms (modeled by a decrease in social interaction) and positive symptoms (modeled by hyperlocomotion) of schizophrenia as well as the effects of potential antipsychotics drugs. At the same time, an increase in social interaction in control animals similar to that induced by benzodiazepines is used to screen potential anxiolytic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CBD on social interaction presented by control animals (Wistar) and SHRs. The lowest dose of CBD (1mg/kg) increased passive and total social interaction of Wistar rats. However, the hyperlocomotion and the deficit in social interaction displayed by SHRs were not altered by any dose of CBD. Our results do not support an antipsychotic property of cannabidiol on symptoms-like behaviors in SHRs but reinforce the anxiolytic profile of this compound in control rats.", 
    "150": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability of the blood-gas barrier. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive research, treatments remain limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective efficacy of a specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, Ro5-4864, in experimental models of ALI in rats.", 
    "151": "ALI was generated by four different methods: (1) intravenous (tail vein) injection of\u00a0Escherichia coli (0111:B4) lipopolysaccaride (LPS), (2) cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), (3)\u00a0mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion, and (4) intraperitoneal injection of \u03b1-naphthylthiourea (ANTU). Ro5-4864 was administered to rats intraperitoneally 30 min before ANTU and LPS administration or intravenously 15 min before reperfusion and CLP. The levels of pulmonary edema (lung weight/body weight ratio) and pleural effusion were measured, and the severity of ALI was scored (0-3).", 
    "152": "Ro5-4864 showed a dose-dependent and significant prophylactic effect on the ANTU-induced lung weight/body weight and pleural effusion/body weight ratios and histopathologic scores. Ro5-4864 also showed significant prophylactic effects against the LPS-induced lung weight/body weight ratio and histopathologic scores. Ro5-4864 significantly decreased the intra-alveolar edema and perialveolar hemorrhage scores in the CLP group. However, we found no prophylactic effect of Ro5-4864 on mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI at the dose used (2 mg/kg intraperitoneally).", 
    "153": "These results have demonstrated, for the first time, a protective effect of Ro5-4864 on experimental ALI induced by ANTU, LPS, and CLP. Ro5-4864 might be a useful therapeutic agent for lung diseases, including ALI, in intensive care patients.",

    "155": "This paper addresses the pharmacokinetic properties of eszopiclone and the extent to which the longer half-life of eszopiclone compared to other commonly used hypnotics (immediate-release zolpidem, modified-release zolpidem, triazolam, zaleplon) may translate into either improved efficacy in enhancing sleep maintenance, or increased probability of residual sedative or performance-impairing effects.", 
    "156": "Eszopiclone is metabolized mainly by Cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) isoforms. The mean half-life in healthy nonelderly individuals (6.1 h) is prolonged in the elderly, in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and by coadministration of CYP3A inhibitors. In clinical trials, eszopiclone consistently improves sleep maintenance relative to placebo, based on measures of shortened wake time after sleep onset, and prolonged total sleep time. However eszopiclone may also produce residual sedation and impairment of driving performance in the initial morning waking hours. A bitter or metallic taste is a common though non-serious adverse effect of eszopiclone. Overall, eszopiclone provides a therapeutic option for patients with sleep maintenance problems, though with accompanying potential for residual morning sedation, as well as a relatively high dollar cost of treatment.", 
    "157": "Globally benzodiazepines remain one of the most prescribed medication groups, especially in the primary care setting. With such high levels of prescribing it is not surprising that benzodiazepine dependence is common, cutting across all socioeconomic levels. Despite recognition of the potential for the development of iatrogenic dependence and the lack of any effective treatment, benzodiazepines continue to be widely prescribed in general practice. Conventional dependence management, benzodiazepine tapering, is commonly a protracted process over several weeks or months. It is often associated with significant withdrawal symptoms and craving leading to patient drop out and return to use. Accordingly, there is a worldwide need to find effective pharmacotherapeutic interventions for benzodiazepine dependence. One drug of increasing interest is the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor antagonist/partial agonist, flumazenil. Multiple bolus intravenous infusions of low dose flumazenil used either with or without benzodiazepine tapering can reduce withdrawal sequelae, and/or longer term symptoms in the months following withdrawal. Preliminary data suggest that continuous intravenous or subcutaneous flumazenil infusion for 4 days significantly reduces acute benzodiazepine withdrawal sequelae. The subcutaneous infusion was shown to be tissue compatible so the development of a longer acting (i.e. several weeks) depot flumazenil formulation has been explored. This could be capable of managing both acute and longer term benzodiazepine withdrawal sequelae. Preliminary in vitro water bath and in vivo biocompatibility data in sheep show that such an implant is feasible and so is likely to be used in clinical trials in the near future.", 
    "158": "Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) refers to chronic orofacial pain, unaccompanied by mucosal lesions or other evident clinical signs. It is observed principally in middle-aged patients and postmenopausal women. BMS is characterized by an intense burning or stinging sensation, typically on the tongue or in other areas of the oral mucosa. It can be accompanied by other sensory disorders such as dry mouth or taste alterations. Probably of multifactorial origin, and often idiopathic, with a still unknown etiopathogenesis in which local, systemic and psychological factors are implicated. Currently there is no consensus on the diagnosis and classification of BMS. This study reviews the literature on this syndrome, with special reference to the etiological factors that may be involved and the clinical aspects they present. The diagnostic criteria that should be followed and the therapeutic management are discussed with reference to the most recent studies.", 
    "159": "The present study examined the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of the aqueous extract of Alafia multiflora Stapf (AM) stem barks (150 and 300\u2009mg/kg, 7 days administration) on rats and mice, using experimental paradigms of anxiety and depression. In the open field, the aqueous extract increased significantly the number of center square crossed and the time spent at the center of the field as well as the rearing time, while the grooming time was reduced significantly. In the elevated plus maze, the aqueous extract increased the time spent and the number of entries in the open arms. All these effects were also completely reversed by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors and pindolol a \u03b2-adrenoceptors blocker/5-HT 1A/1B receptor antagonist. The time spent in the light compartment, the latency time, and the number of the light-dark transitions increased significantly in the light/dark exploration test after the treatment with AM. The extract was able to reduce significantly the immobility time and increase swimming as well as climbing duration. Taken together, the present work evidenced anxiolytic effects of the aqueous extract of AM that might involve an action on benzodiazepine-type receptors and an antidepressant effect where noradrenergic mechanisms will probably play a role.", 
    "160": "Human CYP3A is the most abundant P450 isozyme present in the human liver and small intestine, and metabolizes around 50% of medical drugs on the market. The human CYP3A subfamily comprises four members (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP3A43) encoded on human chromosome 7. However, transgenic mouse lines carrying the entire human CYP3A cluster have not been constructed because of limitations in conventional cloning techniques. Here, we show that the introduction of a human artificial chromosome (HAC) containing the entire genomic human CYP3A locus recapitulates tissue- and stage-specific expression of human CYP3A genes and xenobiotic metabolism in mice. About 700 kb of the entire CYP3A genomic segment was cloned into a HAC (CYP3A-HAC), and trans-chromosomic (Tc) mice carrying a single copy of germline-transmittable CYP3A-HAC were generated via a chromosome-engineering technique. The tissue- and stage-specific expression profiles of CYP3A genes were consistent with those seen in humans. We further generated mice carrying the CYP3A-HAC in the background homozygous for targeted deletion of most endogenous Cyp3a genes. In this mouse strain with 'fully humanized' CYP3A genes, the kinetics of triazolam metabolism, CYP3A-mediated mechanism-based inactivation effects and formation of fetal-specific metabolites of dehydroepiandrosterone observed in humans were well reproduced. Thus, these mice are likely to be valuable in evaluating novel drugs metabolized by CYP3A enzymes and in studying the regulation of human CYP3A gene expression. Furthermore, this system can also be used for generating Tc mice carrying other human metabolic genes.",

SOD1 activity profile following native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that aripiprazole and quetiapine protect enzyme activity from inhibition with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showed that sertindole decreases activity of CAT comparing with control non-treated erythrocytes. Moreover, in sertindole treated erythrocytes, negative correlation between SOD1 and glutathione peroxidase activities was found. Increased amount of hydrogen peroxide in such situation may leave erythrocytes and transform their role in circulation from anti-oxidative to pro-oxidative.",

Urine sample was purified by solid phase extraction (SPE), and the analysis was achieved using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to analyze the target compounds. Extraction recoveries were 65-122% for all the analytes. The method showed acceptable intra-assay and inter-assay precision (both relative standard deviation (RSD)\u226411.2%) for quality control (QC) samples. The limits of detections (LODs) were in the range of 0.1-2 ng/mL. The present assay was applied to analyze the urine obtained from three volunteers after oral administration of a single dose 5mg of diazepam. The results showed that, the detection periods of oxazepam glucuronide and temazepam glucuronide were much longer than diazepam and other metabolites.",

No other significant differences between groups in cognitive performance were found. In each OST drug group, approximately 10% of the attention performance could be predicted by drug treatment variables. Use of benzodiazepine medication predicted about 10% of performance variance in working memory. Treatment with more than one other psychoactive drug (than opioid or BZD) and frequent substance abuse during the past month predicted about 20% of verbal memory performance.",

This dose was six times the recommended starting dose per the patient. In the emergency department two hours post injection, he complained of diffuse body aches, sweating, and a sensation of anxiety. Vital signs included BP 151/85 mmHg, HR 130 bpm that peaked at 146 bpm, and temperature of 97.8\u00b0F. Physical exam demonstrated a restless and anxious appearing male with mydriasis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and diffuse muscle tremors. Pertinent laboratory values were creatinine 2.25 mg/dL, CPK 1760 IU/L, troponin 0.23 ng/mL, WBC 19.1 k/\u03bcL. Urinalysis demonstrated 3 + blood with red cell casts but 0-2 RBC/hpf. Qualitative urine drug screen was negative for metabolites of cocaine and amphetamines but positive for opiates. The patient received benzodiazepines for agitation and anxiety and had improvement in his symptoms. He was admitted to the ICU and during hospitalization his CPK elevated to 17773 IU/L 12 hours later. He continued to receive intravenous fluids with sodium bicarbonate for rhabdomyolysis and his CPK decreased to 2622 IU/L with improvement of creatinine to 1.23 mg/dL upon discharge from the ICU after 3 days.

The extract was applied to LC-TOF-MS analysis, implementing a 13 min chromatography gradient with mobile phases of ammonium formate and methanol using positive mode electrospray. Several common drugs and metabolites can share the same mass and chemical formula among unrelated compounds, but they are structurally different. In this method, the LC-TOF-MS was able to resolve many isobaric compounds by accurate mass correlation within 15 ppm mass units and a narrow retention time interval of less than 10 s of separation. Drug recovery yields varied among spiked compounds, but resulted in overall robust area counts to deliver an average match score of 86 when compared to the retention time and mass of authentic standards.

    "182": "Hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) has been demonstrated to potentially become a mainstream sample preparation technique for complex samples. Nevertheless, the need for a relatively long extraction time is considered to be the major disadvantage of this method. Lengthy extractions may cause the loss of the extraction phase and may change the contents of biological samples via the action of enzymes. Therefore, control calibrations for particular biological systems must be made. In this study, a theoretical model of the mass transfer dynamics of two-phase HF-LPME was proposed, and the kinetic calibration (KC) of this method for plasma and urine samples was validated. The theoretical results were validated by examining the kinetics of the extraction and back-extraction processes of HF-LPME. The KC-HF-LPME method was successfully used to correct for matrix effects in plasma and urine samples during flunitrazepam analysis. The free amount of flunitrazepam was extracted from plasma for 10 min and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The amount of pre-added standard and the standard remaining in the extraction phase after extraction were used for the quantification of flunitrazepam in plasma and urine samples. The new method not only significantly shortens the extraction time but also provides a new opportunity to determine the free concentration of analyte in biological systems.", 
    "183": "CCK is hypothesized to inhibit meal size by acting at CCK1 receptors (CCK1R) on vagal afferent neurons that innervate the gastrointestinal tract and project to the hindbrain. Earlier studies have shown that obese Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, which carry a spontaneous null mutation of the CCK1R, are hyperphagic and obese. Recent findings show that rats with CCK1R-null gene on a Fischer 344 background (Cck1r(-/-)) are lean and normophagic. In this study, the metabolic phenotype of this rat strain was further characterized. As expected, the CCK1R antagonist, devazepide, failed to stimulate food intake in the Cck1r(-/-) rats. Both Cck1r(+/+) and Cck1r(-/-) rats became diet-induced obese (DIO) when maintained on a high-fat diet relative to chow-fed controls. Cck1r(-/-) rats consumed larger meals than controls during the dark cycle and smaller meals during the light cycle. These effects were accompanied by increased food intake, total spontaneous activity, and energy expenditure during the dark cycle and an apparent reduction in respiratory quotient during the light cycle. To assess whether enhanced responsiveness to anorexigenic factors may contribute to the lean phenotype, we examined the effects of melanotan II (MTII) on food intake and body weight. We found an enhanced effect of MTII in Cck1r(-/-) rats to suppress food intake and body weight following both central and peripheral administration. These results suggest that the lean phenotype is potentially driven by increases in total spontaneous activity and energy expenditure.",

We have compared the disposition of morphine, midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol in TH with normothermia in man. Fourteen patients treated with TH following cardiac arrest (33-34\u00b0C) were compared with eight matched critically ill patients (36-38\u00b0C). Continuous infusions of morphine and midazolam were stopped and replaced with infusions of fentanyl and propofol to describe elimination and start of infusion pharmacokinetics, respectively. Serial serum and urine samples were collected for 6-8 hours for validated quantification and subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis. During TH, morphine elimination half-life (t(1/2)) was significantly higher, while total clearance (CL(tot)) was significantly lower (median [semi-interquartile range (s-iqr)]): t(1/2), 266 (43) versus 168 (11) minutes, P < 0.01; CL(tot), 1201 (283) versus 1687 (200) ml/min, P < 0.01. No significant differences were seen for midazolam. CL(tot) of fentanyl and propofol was significantly lower in hypothermic patients [median (s-iqr)]: fentanyl, 726 (230) versus 1331 (678) ml/min, P < 0.05; propofol, 2046 (305) versus 2665 (223) ml/min, P < 0.05. Compared with the matched, normothermic intensive care unit patients, t(1/2) of morphine was significantly higher during TH.

The prolonged use of these drugs is thought to be related to severe withdrawal symptoms and potential dependency. The chronic and extensive use of BZD/Z drugs has become a public health issue and has led to multiple campaigns to reduce both prescription and consumption of BZD/Z-drugs.

Substances implicated were buprenorphine (n\u2009=\u20098), benzodiazepines (n\u2009=\u20097), cannabis (n\u2009=\u20096), cocaine (n\u2009=\u20094), heroin (n\u2009=\u20093), amphetamine, ecstasy, morphine, codeine, and tramadol (n\u2009=\u20091, respectively); there was polydrug use in six cases.", 
    "202": "The PMSI database can be useful to identify certain cases of abuse and dependence. This pilot study has been conducted at a local level; as the PMSI is available in all hospital settings in France, further analysis could be done at the regional and national levels. Such data could be a valuable indicator to analyze trends and assess the medical consequences of substance abuse.",

    "204": "A 54-year-old Asian man received his first infusion of cetuximab after pretreatment with ondansetron, ranitidine, diphenhydramine, and dexamethasone. Approximately 15 minutes after initiation of the cetuximab infusion, the patient called for help. The nurse found the patient sitting up with a blank stare, and the patient began to have a generalized seizure. The emergency resuscitation team was called and administered lorazepam 2 mg i.v., at which time the seizure ceased. The patient required emergent intubation, but no cardiopulmonary resuscitation was necessary. After intubation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Computed tomography of the head found no evidence of lesions. The patient remained stable, was extubated, and was transferred out of the intensive care unit the next day. Fourteen days after the seizure, the patient returned for follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and head with gadolinium contrast. Per the radiologist's report, there were no enhancing lesions to suggest metastases, no abnormalities to suggest infarct or tumor, and no bone abnormalities, and the patient's brain volume was within normal limits for his age. Based on the Naranjo et al. probability scale score, the relationship between the patient's seizure and cetuximab infusion was probable.",

Method. Collected data concern mainly subjects' sociodemographic situation, their state of health and their current consumption of psychoactive substance. Results. In 2010, 1394 subjects have been included, describing 2\u00a0450 consumptions of psychoactive susbtance. Their mean age is 38,2\u00b112,7 years. Eighty-six per cent have a stable accomodation and 52% are in employment. Fifty-six percent of included subjects present a psychiatric comorbidity. Among included subjects, HIV and HVC prevalence is respectively 3% and 20%. Fourty-five percent of included subjects have been using intraveinous route, 6% of whom using it currently. Eighty-two percent consume opiate maintenance treatment and 29% benzodiazepines. Conclusion. The OPEMA programme supplement the french pharmacodependence assessment system with collecting data from general practitioners, and promotes a global knowledge of dependent subjects' state of health.", 
    "207": "Ischemic heart disease and stroke are the two leading causes of death worldwide. Antiplatelet therapy plays the most significant role in the management of these cardiovascular and cerebrovascular occlusive events to prevent recurrent ischemic attack. Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet drug, is widely prescribed either alone or in combination with aspirin as dual antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of vascular occlusive events. The antiplatelet response to clopidogrel varies widely. Hyporesponders and nonresponders are likely to have adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up. Some drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole), calcium channel blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (nefazadone), coumarin derivatives (phenprocoumon), benzodiazepines, sulfonylurea, erythromycin, and itraconazole, decrease the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel when administered concomitantly. Decreased response to clopidogrel is common among Asians due to genetic polymorphisms associated with clopidogrel resistance, and it is nearly 70% in some of the Asian communities. It is necessary to study Asian populations, because there are a large number of Asians throughout the world due to increased migration. Current guidelines do not make genetic testing or platelet response testing mandatory prior to clopidogrel prescription. Therefore, it is important for clinicians treating Asian patients to keep in mind the interindividual variability in response to clopidogrel when prescribing the drug.", 
    "208": "GABA(A) receptors are critically involved in hippocampal oscillations. GABA(A) receptor \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunits are differentially expressed throughout the hippocampal circuitry and thereby may have distinct contributions to oscillations. It is unknown which GABA(A) receptor \u03b1 subunit controls hippocampal oscillations and where these receptors are expressed. To address these questions we used transgenic mice expressing GABA(A) receptor \u03b11 and/or \u03b12 subunits with point mutations (H101R) that render these receptors insensitive to allosteric modulation at the benzodiazepine binding site, and tested how increased or decreased function of \u03b1 subunits affects hippocampal oscillations. Positive allosteric modulation by zolpidem prolonged decay kinetics of hippocampal GABAergic synaptic transmission and reduced the frequency of cholinergically induced oscillations. Allosteric modulation of GABAergic receptors in CA3 altered oscillation frequency in CA1, while modulation of GABA receptors in CA1 did not affect oscillations. In mice having a point mutation (H101R) at the GABA(A) receptor \u03b12 subunit, zolpidem effects on cholinergically induced oscillations were strongly reduced compared to wild-type animals, while zolpidem modulation was still present in mice with the H101R mutation at the \u03b11 subunit. Furthermore, genetic knockout of \u03b12 subunits strongly reduced oscillations, whereas knockout of \u03b11 subunits had no effect. Allosteric modulation of GABAergic receptors was strongly reduced in unitary connections between fast spiking interneurons and pyramidal neurons in CA3 of \u03b12H101R mice, but not of \u03b11H101R mice, suggesting that fast spiking interneuron to pyramidal neuron synapses in CA3 contain \u03b12 subunits. These findings suggest that \u03b12-containing GABA(A) receptors expressed in the CA3 region provide the inhibition that controls hippocampal rhythm during cholinergically induced oscillations.",

    "213": "In this retrospective study, we report the epidemiological characteristics of all poisoning deaths in Epirus, Greece, from 1998 to 2010; we present the toxicological findings and the statistical evaluation of the results. This is the first detailed scientific report on all the officially certified poisoning deaths concerning part of the Greek population. A total of 126 poisoning fatalities were recorded, 67 of them being mono-intoxications (53.2%). The cause of poisoning was as follows: drugs of abuse (60%); carbon monoxide (19.8%); pesticides (9.5%); corrosives (4.8%); pharmaceuticals (4.8%); and spider bite (0.8%). The most frequently detected poisonous substances were as follows: heroin (65 cases), ethanol (55), benzodiazepines (42), carbon monoxide (25), cocaine (17), cannabinoids (17) and pesticides (12). Increasing tendency in poisoning death rates was recorded, due to an increase in accidental poisoning deaths attributed mainly to drugs of abuse (total, accidental, and drugs-of-abuse poisoning death rates per 100,000 inhabitants per year were 1.87, 1.19, and 0.79, respectively, in the period 1998-2002 and 3.97, 3.41, and 2.55, respectively, in the period 2007-2010).", 
    "214": "Frame-based stereotactic biopsies remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of intracerebral lesions. A major advantage is the ability to perform these procedures under local anesthesia (LA). However, there is no consensus on whether or when to use LA or general anesthesia (GA). It has been postulated that the use of LA may reduce the risk of complications. This study aims to objectify the efficacy and safety of stereotactic biopsies under LA versus GA by analyzing a prospective registry for stereotactic biopsies.", 
    "215": "A prospective registry for stereotactic procedures was analyzed for the activities performed between May 2009 and August 2011. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing a stereotactic biopsy. Patients with functional stereotactic procedures, cyst or abscess evacuation, and children were excluded. Of the remaining 274 patients, 204 could be randomly matched considering sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and type of hospitalization. The primary endpoint was the diagnostic yield. Secondary endpoints were safety and procedural time intervals.", 
    "216": "Ninety-six percent of diagnosis was achieved in the LA group and 94% within the GA group. There was no significant difference in the overall complication rate. However, the rate of pulmonary complications was higher in the GA group (P=0.059). The rate of bleeding was significantly higher in the LA group (P=0.003) intraoperatively. However, no significant difference was found clinically or on routine postoperative computed tomography scan reports. There was a significant reduction in the time spent in the operating room within the LA group (P<0.001).", 
    "217": "The type of anesthesia may not interfere with the diagnostic yield in stereotactic biopsies. Patients operated under LA are less likely to suffer pulmonary complications. Furthermore, LA could spare hospital resources in this setting.", 
    "218": "The effects of thyroxine and its related compounds on the benzodiazepine-insensitive \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors were studied. Thyroxine at micromolar concentrations potentiated the (3)H-Ro15-4513 binding to rat brain membranes in-vitro in the thalamus, striatum, cortex and hippocampus, but not in cerebellum. In the thalamus, the rank order of potency was the following: 3,3',5,5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid (TETRAC)>L-thyroxine>3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (3,5-T2). TETRAC induced a slight potentiation of flumazenil binding to diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in the thalamus and striatum while no effect was found in cortex and hippocampus. Consequently, we examined whether these compounds could exert their modulatory effect on the currents mediated by benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA(A) receptors. The diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents were recorded from acutely isolated rat ventrobasal thalamic neurons by applying low concentrations of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP). TETRAC and thyroxine at low \u03bcM concentrations potentiated the THIP-evoked currents, although 3,5-T2 had no effect on the THIP-induced currents. Ethanol had no effect on the enhancing effects of TETRAC. TETRAC itself evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents at high concentrations beyond 30 \u03bcM. Although the effects of TETRAC and thyroxine were observed at non-physiological concentrations of hormones, the present results might lead to new lead structures with specificity to diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptor subtypes."
