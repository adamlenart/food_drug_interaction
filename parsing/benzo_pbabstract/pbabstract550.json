    "0": "[3H]Zolpidem, a novel hypnotic drug possessing a chemical structure unrelated to that of benzodiazepine (BZD) was employed as a new ligand to determine its binding characteristics to membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In both structures, the imidazopyridine [3H]zolpidem bound with high affinity to a single population of recognition sites. The cerebellum possessed a similar number of [3H]zolpidem and [3H]diazepam binding sites, while the cerebral cortex possessed a lower density of [3H]zolpidem than [3H]diazepam binding sites. In contrast to [3H]diazepam binding, [3H]zolpidem binding was not detectable in the spinal cord. In the cortex, BZDs had a similar potency to displace [3H]zolpidem and [3H]diazepam binding while non-BZDs were more potent to inhibit [3H] zolpidem binding than [3H]diazepam binding. The binding of [3H]zolpidem was enhanced by GABA to the same extent as [3H]diazepam binding. The increase in [3H] zolpidem binding caused by chloride ions was less pronounced than that in [3H]diazepam binding. It is concluded that [3H]zolpidem possesses selectivity for BZD receptors with the pharmacological characteristics and regional distribution of the BZD1 receptor subtype. [3H]Zolpidem as a radioligand offers a useful additional tool to study the mechanism of action of hypnotics acting through BZD receptor subtypes.", 
    "1": "A new simple mouse assay for the in vivo evaluation of CCK antagonists which is based upon visual determination of the gastric emptying of a charcoal meal is described. CCK-8 (24 micrograms/kg s.c.) but not various other peptide and nonpeptide agents effectively inhibited gastric emptying in this test system. The effect of CCK-8 was antagonized by established peripheral CCK antagonists but not representative agents of various other pharmacological classes. The rank order of potency of the CCK antagonists were: L-364,718 (ED50 = 0.01 mg/kg, i.v.; 0.04 mg/kg, p.o.) greater than Compound 16 (ED50 = 1.5 mg/kg, i.v.; 2.0 mg/kg p.o.) greater than asperlicin (ED50 = 14.8 mg/kg i.v.) greater than proglumide (ED50 = 184 mg/kg i.v.; 890 mg/kg, p.o.). Duration of action studies based upon ED50 values determined at various time intervals after oral administration showed that L-364,718 and proglumide are considerably longer acting than Compound 16. Asperlicin (ED50 greater than 300 mg/kg, p.o.) was ineffective as a CCK antagonist when administered orally. These data provide the first direct comparisons of the in vivo potencies of current CCK antagonists and demonstrate the utility of a new simple mouse assay for the in vivo characterization of peripheral CCK antagonists.", 
    "2": "The effects of chronic ethanol consumption as well as the effects of ethanol added in vitro on phosphoinositide metabolism were determined in mouse forebrain. [32P] incorporation into synaptosomal phosphatidic acid (PhA) was stimulated through both M1 muscarinic cholinergic and alpha 1 adrenergic receptor activation. Similarly, [3H]inositol 1-PO4 accumulation in brain slices was stimulated through these same receptors, but could also be stimulated by histamine1 receptor activation. In mice made physically dependent to ethanol, the magnitude of receptor-mediated [32P] incorporation in PhA did not differ from that of control animals. However, ethanol (100mM) added in vitro to synaptosomes from control mice significantly inhibited the carbamylcholine stimulated PhA response, but had no effect on the response to norepinephrine. Carbamylcholine stimulated [32P] incorporation into PhA, however, was no longer significantly inhibited by the addition of 100mM ethanol to synaptosomes from physically dependent-tolerant animals indicating that a cellular tolerance had developed. In contrast, receptor mediated [3H]inositol 1-PO4 accumulation in brain slices was not significantly affected by either chronic ethanol treatment or the in vitro addition of ethanol as high as 200mM. It is concluded that the muscarinic cholinergic stimulation of [32P] incorporation into PhA, but not [3H]inositol 1-PO4 accumulation is relatively more sensitive to the direct effects of ethanol than are the other receptor mediated phospholipid responses examined in the present investigation and that this sensitivity is lost in animals made behaviorally tolerant and physically dependent to ethanol.", 
    "3": "Four normal volunteers each received three intraduodenal infusions of 0.5 mg triazolam solutions. Three treatments were: a pH 2.3 solution in which 47 per cent of the dose had hydrolysed to form a triazolo-benzophenone (TB); a pH 6.0 solution containing negligible TB; the pH 6.0 solution administered during cimetidine treatment (1200 mg day-1). TB was stable in serum and only very low TB serum concentrations were observed from the pH 2.3 treatment. No difference was observed in any triazolam pharmacokinetic parameter between the pH 6.0 and the pH 2.3 treatments. Cimetidine increased the triazolam AUC infinity and Cmax by 54 and 35 per cent, respectively. These results indicate that TB undergoes extensive presystemic conversion to triazolam and the triazolam-cimetidine interaction occurs primarily through a reduction in triazolam clearance.", 
    "4": "The effects of daily oral administration of imipramine hydrochloride (5-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz-[b,f]azepine monohydrochloride; 50 mg/kg) and/or diazepam (7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one ; 5 mg/kg) in a 1% aqueous solution of carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC) on the body weight, organ weights, and activities of various enzymes, including drug metabolizing enzyme systems were investigated in rats during a 15-day period. The plasma concentrations of imipramine and desipramine were also determined. In addition, the effect of a single intravenous administration of imipramine hydrochloride (5 mg/kg) on the plasma concentration-time profiles of imipramine and desipramine was investigated in rats given the same drug treatments. The plasma concentration-time profiles of imipramine and desipramine were analyzed pharmacokinetically. The rats treated with imipramine hydrochloride showed a greater inhibition of body weight gain than those treated with diazepam, and those treated with imipramine hydrochloride and diazepam simultaneously showed a body weight gain similar to those treated with imipramine hydrochloride alone. No significant differences in organ weight (per 100 g of body weight) were found. The imipramine hydrochloride plus diazepam treatment group showed a greater increase in drug-metabolizing enzyme activities than the imipramine hydrochloride treatment group, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, the plasma levels of imipramine and desipramine after oral administration for 15 d suggested that the imipramine hydrochloride plus diazepam treatment group did not show increased imipramine metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "6": "Hypochondriasis was assessed in 60 patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia using the Illness Behavior Questionnaire. Before treatment, IBQ hypochondriasis scores were similar to those of a group of hypochondriacal psychiatric patients. In patients who improved with treatment, significant reductions in somatic preoccupation, disease phobia, and disease conviction occurred. Hypochondriasis appears to be a prominent feature of panic disorder and agoraphobia, and responds to treatment of the primary conditions. Our findings underscore the importance of providing adequate treatment and thereby avoiding wasteful use of medical resources and alienation of patients from doctors.", 
    "7": "According to the hypothesis implying that the main reason of physical dependence on opiate is the inhibition of brain L-asparaginase activity and L-aspartic acid gradually decreases compulsory opiate intake so that physical dependence disappears by itself, 31 opiate addicts were given 8 g L-aspartic acid for 7 days after withdrawal from opiate and appearance of abstinence syndrome signs. The attenuations by L-aspartic acid of the abstinence syndrome signs were statistically compared with those obtained from other 12 opiate addicts received daily 50 mg chlorpromazine + 60 mg diazepam which have long been used to suppress abstinence syndrome because of their multiple receptor blocking and sedative effects. The intensity and duration of 13 signs out of 16 ones were found to be significantly more alleviated and shortened in the addicts treated with L-aspartic acid.", 
    "8": "A specific and sensitive assay has been developed to quantitate triazolam in postmortem blood using 2H6-triazolam as an internal standard. Triazolam is isolated from whole blood by adsorption on an Amberlite XAD-2 resin and subsequent elution with an organic solvent. The extract is analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectometry using selected ion monitoring (GC/MS/SIM) in the negative chemical ionization mode (Cl-). The procedure is presently being used in case work and the results from 36 cases are presented.", 
    "9": "In a patient with the stiff-man syndrome, abnormal exteroceptive reflexes in hand and arm muscles were used as a tool for investigating the effects of various centrally acting adrenergic drugs by means of acute testing. Clonidine, tizanidine and methamphetamine induced reflex suppression whereas reserpine had a biphasic effect: transient reflex suppression and delayed reflex enhancement. The drug actions on the reflexes paralleled to some degree those on the muscle stiffness. It is concluded that alpha-adrenergic stimulation leads to reflex suppression and muscular relaxation, whereas alpha-adrenergic blockade has the opposite effect. Correspondingly, long-term oral treatment with the alpha-stimulator, tizanidine, proved successful. The hypothesis is put forward that a noradrenergic system which exerts a net inhibitory influence on muscle tone and on exteroceptive reflexes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the stiff-man syndrome.", 
    "10": "The effect of flow rate and type of i.v. solution container on adsorption of diazepam to i.v. administration systems was studied. Diazepam solutions were prepared in 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection in glass, polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containers to a final theoretical concentration of 50 micrograms/mL. PVC administration sets were attached to the containers, and diazepam solution was infused at flow rates of 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 mL/hr. Solution samples were taken initially and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, and 4.00 hours after infusion of the first 5 mL of solution through the system. Three infusion trials were performed using each type of container. Adsorption of diazepam to each type of container was evaluated by serial measurements of diazepam concentration over a 168-hour period using five containers of each type. The effect of shaking the container on diazepam adsorption to PVC containers was tested by comparing concentrations in five containers that were shaken during a two-hour period with concentrations in five unshaken containers. Diazepam concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically in duplicate. Diazepam concentrations in glass containers remained unchanged throughout the 168-hour study period; concentrations decreased by about 5% in polyethylene containers and as much as 75% in PVC bags. Shaking increased diazepam adsorption to the PVC container. In the infusion trials, the percentage of diazepam adsorbed increased as flow rate decreased. The amount of diazepam adsorbed to the i.v. administration system was ore dependent on flow rate and infusion time than on the type of container used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The effect of administration-set tubing length on adsorption of diazepam to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing was studied, and a simple equation for calculating the dose of diazepam delivered to the patient during an i.v. infusion of diazepam was derived. Diazepam solutions were prepared in 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection in glass bottles to a final theoretical concentration of 50 micrograms/mL. PVC administration sets were attached to the bottles, and the tubing was then cut to various lengths or the entire length was used for infusion of diazepam solution at a constant rate of 60 mL/hr. Samples of the diazepam solution were collected in glass test tubes initially and after infusion periods of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, and 4.00 hours. Diazepam concentrations were assayed spectrophotometrically in duplicate, and each infusion trial was performed three times. The mean diazepam concentrations in the bottles remained within 100 +/- 1% of initial concentration throughout the study. However, solution samples collected after the four-hour infusion period varied in concentration from 45.5 micrograms/mL using the 23-cm length of tubing to 28.8 micrograms/mL using the entire (185-cm) tubing. Also, the percentage of diazepam adsorbed to the tubing increased as the infusion time decreased. A biexponential equation based on the adsorption data obtained for various tubing lengths was successfully used to calculate the percentage of the theoretical diazepam dose delivered through the tubing during different infusion times. To minimize the adsorption of diazepam to PVC administration sets, the shortest possible length of administration-set tubing should be used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "In the therapeutic management of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia, diazepam, baclofen or gamma-vinyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid have been advocated. It has been postulated, but not proven, that the beneficial effects of these agents in tardive dyskinesia may be mediated by enhancing GABAergic transmission. In this study, it is reported that, during a 3-day withdrawal period following daily administration of 3 mg/kg of haloperidol (i.p.) for 3 weeks, the activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase in the striatum increased from 72.6 +/- 7.8 to 92.5 +/- 10.2 nmol 14CO2/mg protein/hr, and the concentration of dopamine in the striatum increased from 7.87 +/- 0.23 to 8.86 +/- 0.38 micrograms/g wet tissue. Diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.), given during the withdrawal period from haloperidol was able to nullify the enhancement in the concentration of dopamine but not in the activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase in the striatum. The results of these studies are interpreted to indicate that the reported beneficial effects of diazepam and GABA-mimetic agents in ameliorating the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia may occur through a mechanism which does not necessarily link transmission involving both dopamine and GABA.",

    "14": "Nitrazepam pharmacokinetics were studied in 14 obese (mean +/- s.e. mean body weight 107 +/- 9 kg; percent ideal body weight [IBW] 166 +/- 12%) and 14 normal body weight (63 +/- 3 kg; percent IBW 98 +/- 2%) subjects. After an overnight fast, each subject ingested 10 mg nitrazepam orally. Nitrazepam concentrations were determined in plasma samples obtained over the following 72 h. Comparison of peak nitrazepam plasma concentration (94.2 +/- 10.3-obese vs 119 +/- 14.6 ng ml-1; NS) and time required after drug administration to reach peak concentration (1.52 +/- 0.24-obese vs 1.59 +/- 0.36 h; NS) indicated no differences between obese and control subjects. Elimination half-life was markedly increased in obese subjects (33.5 +/- 2.2 vs 23.9 +/- 1.2 h; P less than 0.001) due to increased apparent volume of distribution (Vd) (290 +/- 45 vs 137 +/- 12 l; P less than 0.005). Oral clearance was also increased in the obese subjects (101 +/- 12.4 vs 66.8 +/- 12.4 ml min-1; P less than 0.02). Extent of nitrazepam binding to plasma proteins was slightly decreased in obese subjects (% unbound--19.7 +/- 0.4-obese vs 17.9 +/- 0.3%; P less than 0.005). Correction of both Vd (2.62 +/- 0.17-obese vs 2.22 +/- 0.19 l kg-1; NS) and clearance (0.93 +/- 0.06-obese +/- 1.07 +/- 0.07 ml min-1 kg-1; NS) for total body weight (TBW) suggested that increases in obese subjects of both of these parameters were a function of body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "Evidence supports the notion that differences between the Long-Sleep and Short-Sleep selectively-bred lines of mice are attributable to differences in brain excitability and that these differences are mediated by activity of the GABAergic system. The general applicability of this hypothesis to other populations of mice was tested by using an outbred strain of mice. Specifically, a heterogeneous strain of mice was administered several doses of the hypnotic chlordiazepoxide. Additionally, the indirect GABA agonist AOAA, and the GABA antagonists bicuculline, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol were administered to independent groups in conjunction with chlordiazepoxide. The results clearly demonstrate that chlordiazepoxide dose-dependently increased hypnosis, while AOAA enhanced, and the antagonists attenuated sleep time. These findings can be used to support the contention that GABA mediates the bidirectional response of Long-Sleep and Short-Sleep mice to CNS hypnotic-depressants; and, further, show that GABA mediation of sleep time in mice is a general phenomenon.", 
    "16": "A number of complications can arise during the drug treatment of alcohol withdrawal, which can be serious or even fatal.

By consideration of pharmacologic principles and clinical experience, an optimal drug treatment regimen is formulated that minimizes these risks, while remaining highly effective.", 
    "17": "Over 600 compounds, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, may cause anticholinergic toxicity. Diagnosis of this potentially fatal condition rests on a detailed history and observation of peripheral and central anticholinergic signs. While supportive therapy is sufficient in most patients, some require treatment with physostigmine. Patient education, judicious drug selection and regular reviews of patients' medications will reduce the risk of anticholinergic toxicity.", 
    "18": "Biochemical studies have shown that the non-barbiturate anesthetic etomidate can interact in a stereoselective, barbiturate-like fashion with the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, enhancing both benzodiazepine and GABA binding, but its electrophysiological effects upon the mammalian CNS are largely unknown. The present investigations were designed to characterize the electrophysiological effects of etomidate on the recurrent GABAergic inhibitory pathway in the CA1 region of the rat in vitro hippocampal slice and to compare the actions of etomidate to those of pentobarbital. Electrical stimulation of the alveus elicited a biphasic hyperpolarizing response, consisting of an initial bicuculline-sensitive GABAergic IPSP. This was followed by a second component, termed the late hyperpolarizing potential (LHP), which is thought to reflect an increase in potassium conductance. Both pentobarbital (100 microM) and (+)-etomidate (10 microM) markedly increased the duration of the initial GABA-mediated IPSP, and frequently increased its amplitude as well. However, no significant effects of either of these drugs were observed on the LHP. Together with previous biochemical findings, our data suggest that the depressant effects of etomidate and barbiturates on the nervous system may reflect a common action upon a stereoselective receptor site intimately associated with bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptors and the chloride ion channel.", 
    "19": "Preclinical evidence suggests that alterations in serotonin function may relate to the development of anxiety and the therapeutic effectiveness of antianxiety treatments. Serotonin increases prolactin release, and intravenous administration of the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, produces reliable elevations in serum prolactin levels. To evaluate serotonergic function, the effects of intravenous tryptophan on prolactin secretion were determined in 23 drug-free patients meeting DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. In nine of the patients the tryptophan infusion was repeated during long-term alprazolam treatment. The ability of tryptophan to increase prolactin levels was not different between the patients and healthy subjects and was not altered by alprazolam treatment. These findings suggest serotonin function may be normal in panic anxiety disorders and the antipanic mechanism of action of alprazolam may be unrelated to effects on serotonin activity.", 
    "20": "An automatic analysis of bioelectrical activity in some structures of the rabbit's brain was performed after i.v. administration of diazepam, phenytoin or phenobarbital. It was found that diazepam raised the ratio of fast activity in the afterdischarges pattern but paralelly decreased the total energy involved in the production of after-discharges in the cortex and midbrain reticular formation. Phenobarbital caused a significant shift in frequencies, increasing the ratio of slow activities (in the exception of hippocampus) and decreased the power spectra of afterdischarges in all structures (in the exception of midbrain reticular formation). Phenytoin, similarly to phenobarbital, decreased the ratio of fast activities. This effect was significant only in thalamus and midbrain reticular formation. At the same time it increased the total power of signal from hippocampus and midbrain reticular formation.", 
    "21": "Status Epilepticus (SE) is defined as an epileptic seizure which is so frequently repeated or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting epileptic condition. SE is observed in all age groups, but its frequency increases among younger children. Etiological factors vary with age. During infancy acute encephalopathies (infectious, anoxic-ischaemic, metabolic, etc.) are prevalent, while later non progressive encephalopathies are more frequent. Cryptogenic cases are present in all age groups, but \"febrile\" cases are observed before two years of age. Generalized forms are rare. The most frequent SE is Unilateral non alternating, which is observed exclusively among children. The semeiological diagnosis of SE with the help of EEG monitoring can be useful, since some forms of SE have constant etiological factors and prognosis. Since the condition of SE may cause brain damage or even endanger patient's life, immediate and adequate treatment is necessary. Diazepam and Phenytoin are particularly effective for stopping the seizures. A practical scheme for treatment is presented.", 
    "22": "Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded in 15 patients with extrapyramidal disturbances after intravenous administration of 10 mg of diazepam (Relanium, Polfa). Cortical SEP were recorded before and after operations and thalamic SEP were recorded during stereotaxic interventions on thalamic nuclei VL and Vim. The results demonstrated that diazepam had a significant positive influence on the recording of SEP, eliminating muscular artifacts caused by increased muscular tonus and extrapyramidal tremor. Diazepam had no evident effect on the SEP and caused no changes of the short-latency specific cortical SEP. This effect was, however, evident on the later components of the SEP and it seemed to affect mainly the N63 wave whose amplitude was always reduced or absent. In the postoperative investigations the cortical SEP in the hemisphere operated on (contralateral to the site of stimulation) were reduced in the phase of short-latency components. In the ipsilateral hemisphere the cortical SEP remained similar to the normal ones, and after diazepam their amplitude was markedly reduced. Intraoperatively recorded thalamic SEP showed after diazepam a considerable decrease of the amplitude of all components, sometimes the curve was completely flat, including the specific phase of the potential. On the other hand, diazepam failed to extinguish cortical SEP which showed even a greater amplitude of short-latency and long-latency components than in the records obtained without this drug, with the exception of disappearing N63 component.", 
    "23": "Fifty Hong Kong Chinese patients between 20-40 years, of ASA Gd I, undergoing third molar extraction were randomly allocated into two groups. For conscious sedation, to supplement local anaesthesia, one group received intravenous diazepam and the other intravenous midazolam. The majority in the study had never heard of intravenous sedation being available to supplement local anaesthesia during dental surgery and when given the chance to experience this method the majority found it highly acceptable. None preferred general anaesthesia for dental surgery. In this study midazolam had more advantages to the patient than diazepam; quicker onset of sedation, less pain during injection, profound anterograde amnesia and fewer postoperative complications being the main features. However, both drugs produced good operating conditions. Incidence of thrombophlebitis was low with both drugs, and may be so in Chinese compared with non-Chinese.", 
    "24": "Alterations of plasma metabolite profiles were studied following single or multiple oral administrations of 5-[(2-aminoacetamido) methyl]-1-[p-chloro-2-(o-chlorobenzoyl)phenyl]-N, N-dimethyl-1H-1, 2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride dihydrate (450191-S) in Beagle dogs. In plasma, unchanged 450191-S was not detected, but active metabolite, 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(N, N-dimethylcarbamoyl)-4H-1,2, 4-triazolo [1, 5-a] [1, 4] benzodiazepine (M-1) appeared first, followed by four active metabolites that were hydroxylated or demethylated in the N, N-dimethylcarbamoyl side chain of M-1. At single doses of 5 to 50 mg/kg, the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) of the metabolites were linearly increased, showing that there was no saturable process in the steps of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. After multiple administrations (50 mg/kg/d for 15 d), the same metabolites appeared in the plasma but the patterns of the plasma metabolite profiles were considerably different from those after single administrations. The peak plasma levels of M-1 and its hydroxylated metabolites in the carbamoyl side chain were attained more rapidly in the multiple administrations, demonstrating higher peak values compared to those in the single administrations, and the eliminations of these metabolites from plasma were also rapid. However, no difference in the values of the AUCs were observed between single and multiple administrations. With the other active metabolites, the peak plasma levels after multiple administrations were considerably lowered by rapid elimination, resulting in a marked increase in AUCs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of pirenzepine with those of atropine a non-selective antimuscarinic agent, on gastroduodenal motor patterns in duodenal ulcer patients. Twenty patients were allocated at random to 2 groups of 10 subjects each. The drugs were administered by bolus intravenous injection as equiactive antisecretory doses of 10 mg pirenzepine and 1 mg atropine. Before and 15 min after drug administration all patients underwent a gastroduodenal manometric and reflexogenic study with a specially designed probe and three inflatable latex balloons. Both drugs significantly decreased antral and duodenal pressure, but atropine was much more effective than pirenzepine: 91 +/- 2% verus 54 +/- 9% decrease in the motility index for the antrum and 95 +/- 1% versus 49 +/- 7% for the duodenum (p less than 0.01). The antral motor threshold was not modified by either drug. The results of this study confirm the selectivity of action of pirenzepine on gastric function.", 
    "26": "In conscious saline loaded rats, the kappa-opioid agonists tifluadom, U50488, and ethylketocyclazocine, given subcutaneously, induced a characteristic diuresis which could be antagonized by naloxone. Bilateral adrenal demedullation significantly reduced adrenal gland catecholamine content and plasma adrenaline levels, but did not significantly affect plasma corticosterone levels, indicating that the adrenal cortex remained both intact and functional. Seven days following bilateral adrenal demedullation, the subcutaneous administration of the kappa-agonists no longer induced diuresis. However, demedullation did not affect the diuretic response to frusemide or clonidine, nor did it affect the antidiuretic response induced by the mu-opioid agonists morphine and buprenorphine. Adrenal catecholamines do not appear to be involved in kappa-opioid-induced diuresis, since pretreatment with propranolol, prazosin and idazoxan did not affect the diuretic response in intact animals. The results indicate a link between the adrenal medulla and kappa-opioid-induced diuresis and suggest that a peripheral mechanism may also be involved in mediating this effect.", 
    "27": "Over the last decade a number of antidepressants have been introduced which differ either chemically, pharmacologically or toxicologically from established tricyclic and monoamine oxidase drugs. Of those presently available, maprotiline is similar in toxicity to tricyclic antidepressants perhaps causing convulsions more frequently. Lofepramine is metabolised to desmethylimipramine, but the limited clinical experience so far suggests that toxicity is less severe than with other tricyclic antidepressants. Amoxapine causes coma, convulsions and less frequently renal failure, but electrocardiographic abnormalities are uncommon. Mianserin and trazodone both cause drowsiness and more infrequently deeper grades of coma. Alprazolam produces the typical benzodiazepine overdose symptoms of drowsiness and floppiness. There is as yet insufficient clinical data to comment on the specific toxicity of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. There are many more new antidepressants in various stages of development and it is likely that several of these will be marketed. Since their individual toxicities differ it is essential that monitoring of their overdose effects should be undertaken.", 
    "28": "A cumulative review of case reports in the literature describing withdrawal reactions secondary to alprazolam is presented. In four of eight reports, the primary withdrawal manifestations were grand mal seizures. One case was characterized by painful myoclonus. In the remaining three cases, the major complications consisted of rebound anxiety with psychotic features. Despite tapering of the daily dosage according to manufacturer guidelines, a withdrawal syndrome was precipitated in three of the cases. As a result of alprazolam's atypical pharmacodynamic profile, the issue is raised as to whether alprazolam is pharmacologically cross-tolerant with other benzodiazepines.", 
    "29": "The clinical and biological correlates of gradual alprazolam withdrawal were investigated in 10 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Verrill's sign was used as the end-point of sedation, and bilateral, similarly impacted lower third molars served as the surgical model. The drugs produced comparable levels of sedation, stable vital signs, and good operating conditions in all patients. Midazolam had numerous advantages over diazepam: more rapid onset of sedation, less pain during injection, profound anterograde amnesia, and fewer postoperative complications. The incidence of thrombophlebitis was low with both drugs and appears to be so in Chinese in general. A significant majority of the patients preferred sedation to other techniques and midazolam to diazepam.", 
    "31": "The CO2-production and degree of relaxation after increasing doses of suxamethonium were measured in seven patients undergoing alloplastic surgery of the hip. The study indicates that the CO2-production rises following the injection of increasing doses of suxamethonium. Another group of patients received diazepam 0.1 mg kg-1 before the injection of suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1. CO2-production was significantly reduced compared to CO2 production when suxamethonium was not preceded by diazepam. It is suggested that diazepam in doses larger than 0.1 mg kg-1 might be effective in preventing fasciculations and postoperative muscle pains before the injection of suxamethonium in a dose of 0.5 mg kg-1.", 
    "32": "The anticonvulsant effectiveness of the benzodiazepine antagonists RO 15-1788, CGS-8216 and PK-11195 were evaluated against threshold and suprathreshold (400 microA) stimulation in fully amygdaloid-kindled rats. Pretreatment with either RO 15-1788 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), CGS-8216 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) or PK-11195 (10 and 60 mg/kg) failed in this study to modify consistently either the afterdischarge thresholds or elicited suprathreshold seizures or duration of afterdischarge. Using a double injection paradigm, the effectiveness of these three benzodiazepine antagonists to reverse the anti-convulsant and behavioral effects of diazepam were studied. When diazepam (3 mg/kg) was injected 15 min before or after a second injection of the vehicle control DMSO (0.25 ml/kg), a significant reduction in the duration of afterdischarge and seizure rank, elicited by a suprathreshold stimulation in amygdaloid-kindled rats, occurred. When either CGS 8216 (10 mg/kg) or RO 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) were given 15 min before diazepam (3 mg/kg) prior to stimulation, the anticonvulsant properties of diazepam were blocked. When RO 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) was given 15 min after diazepam, antagonism of the anticonvulsant effects on diazepam was shown. However, when either CGS-8216 (10 mg/kg) or PK-11195 (10 and 60 mg/kg) were given 15 min after diazepam (3 mg/kg), the anticonvulsant properties of diazepam were not blocked. The anticonvulsant effects of diazepam were reversed when CGS-8216 (10 mg/kg) was given 5 min after diazepam (3 mg/kg) or when a larger dose (30 mg/kg) was given at the same 15 min interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Ethanol aggravates benzodiazepine-induced central nervous depression by pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interactions and Ro 15-1788 reverses promptly the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines. We therefore studied the acute effects of Ro 15-1788 on the ethanol-induced sedation in six healthy male subjects. Subsequently to an oral loading dose (0.54 g ethanol kg-1) ethanol was infused for 4 h (0.15 g ethanol kg-1 h-1) and steady state blood levels between 0.9 to 1.2 g l-1 were reached within 2 h. At steady state and during the elimination phase of ethanol an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg Ro 15-1788 or placebo was administered in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. The marked sedative effects of ethanol as assessed by visual analogue scales (2 to 6 fold increase in the sedation index), and choice reaction time (25 to 40% prolongation) were not affected by Ro 15-1788. However, the pharmaco-EEG indicated that Ro 15-1788 seems to reverse transiently the ethanol-induced changes in total alpha, delta, and slow alpha bands. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between both agents since elimination of Ro 15-1788 (t1/2 = 1.2 +/- 0.7 h) and of ethanol (0.17 +/- 0.02 g l-1 h-1) were in good agreement with control values. Thus, it could be concluded that Ro 15-1788 might affect for a short while the action of ethanol by interfering with the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "34": "Enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission within the substantia nigra has been shown to prevent the motor manifestations of chemically induced and kindled seizures. These findings raise the possibility that the substantia nigra might constitute a site of anticonvulsant drug action if these drugs share an ability to suppress propagation of seizure activity from the nigra to motor effector sites. The current studies monitored effects of a diverse group of anticonvulsant drugs on the extracellular, single unit activity of nondopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata in awake, paralyzed and locally anesthetized male rats. Intravenous phenytoin (1.25-160 mg/kg) and carbamazepine (1.25-40 mg/kg) did not alter neuronal firing at any dose. Conversely, both diazepam (31.25-8,000 micrograms/kg) and clonazepam (2-500 micrograms/kg) partially inhibited firing (to 46 +/- 11% and 59 +/- 6% of base-line rates, respectively), although clonazepam was approximately 16 times more potent in eliciting equivalent degrees of inhibition. Valproic acid (5-640 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (1.25-80 mg/kg) also slowed firing to 65 to 70% of base-line rates, but did so only at the highest doses administered. However, the anesthetic barbiturate pentobarbital (0.3125-80 mg/kg) completely suppressed firing by the highest dose tested. Of those drugs used exclusively for treatment of absence seizures, trimethadione (12.5-800 mg/kg) caused dose-related inhibitions to 37.6 +/- 9.8% of base-line, whereas ethosuximide (12.5-800 mg/kg) markedly stimulated firing, nearly doubling firing rates after the 200 mg/kg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Two amino-phenyl-pyridazine derivatives, SR 41378 and CM 40907, have been reported to antagonize seizures in mice, rats and Papio papio baboons with comparable potencies. Structurally, SR 41378 differs from CM 40907 by an additional chlorine in position 6 of the phenyl ring. In the present study the activity of these two compounds in the operant approach-avoidance conflict test in rats was examined and compared with that of diazepam, pentobarbital, meprobamate and valproate. SR 41378 increased punished responding, a measure of anticonflict activity (ED50 = 5.2 mg/kg), and decreased nonpunished responding, a measure of sedative activity, with a threshold active dose of 20 mg/kg i.p. The overall potency of SR 41378 was comparable to that of pentobarbital. CM 40907 (10-40 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect punished responding and decreased nonpunished responding at the dose of 40 mg/kg i.p. The duration of the anticonflict activity of SR 41378 increased with the dose and lasted over 4 h at the 20-mg/kg i.p. dose. At this dose, sedation lasted 1 h. An increase in anticonflict potency and tolerance to sedation were observed after a 5-day treatment with SR 41378 (20 mg/kg i.p.). The anticonflict and sedative activities of SR 41378 were not antagonized by Ro 15-1788 or CGS 8216. In vitro SR 41378 did not interact with benzodiazepine receptor sites. In conclusion, although CM 40907 and SR 41378 exhibit similar anticonvulsant activities, the present study reveals a major pharmacological difference between the two compounds because SR 41378 also possesses anticonflict properties.", 
    "36": "Drugs which bind to specific benzodiazepine recognition sites fall into three categories: agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists. A set of biochemical parameters is available which distinguishes between the three. In addition, actions of the drugs result in physiological and behavioural effects which are distinguishable. beta-Carboline derivatives provide a group of compounds which show high affinity for the benzodiazepine sites, and which contains examples belonging to each of the three categories. Evidence is reviewed which shows that beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor agonists (ZK 93423, ZK 91296) produce increases in the consumption of a palatable diet by non-deprived rats, that beta-carboline inverse agonists (FG 7142, DMCM) produce an anorectic effect, and that the beta-carboline ZK 93426 acts as a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The results support the proposal of bi-directional control of feeding responses through the action of drugs at a common benzodiazepine receptor. Furthermore, benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists provide a novel class of anorectic agents. Evidence is also reviewed which is suggestive of the modulation of food-related reward by drug actions at benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "37": "Bovine and rat pineal benzodiazepine receptors were characterized using ligands with high affinities for either 'central-type' (CBR) or 'peripheral-type' (PBR) benzodiazepine receptors. The characteristics (Bmax = 83 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein, Kd = 3.88 +/- 0.46 nM) of benzodiazepine receptors in bovine pineal membranes measured with [3H]flunitrazepam (using flunitrazepam to define non-specific binding) were consistent with previously reported values. However, if non-specific binding was defined using Ro 15-1788 (a selective CBR ligand), the Bmax and Kd of [3H]flunitrazepam decreased 51 and 58%, respectively. In addition, when using PK 11195 to determine non-specific binding, the Bmax of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to bovine pineal decreased further (approximately 80%, Kd decreased approximately 39%). Together, these observations strongly suggested the presence of PBR in the bovine pineal. Bovine pineal PBR characterized with [3H]PK 11195 revealed a high density (relative to CBR) of high affinity binding sites (Kd = 1.08 +/- 0.30, Bmax = 776 +/- 33.0 fmol/mg protein). In contrast, when [3H]Ro 5-4864 (1-20 nM) was used to define PBR, no binding was detectable. These observations are in sharp contrast to the rat pineal gland, in which both [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 bind to a large number of PBR with high affinity (Kd approximately equal to 1.9 nM, Bmax approximately equal to 26 pmol/mg protein). Bovine pineal PBR were further characterized with compounds structurally related to either Ro 5-4864 or PK 11195.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Experiments performed in our laboratory, using electrical stimulation combined with microinjection of drugs in the dorsal midbrain central grey (CG) of the rat, evidenced that direct stimulation of GABA receptors with locally administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or the GABAA receptor agonists 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol, isoguvacine and muscimol raised the aversive threshold, defined as the lowest electrical current intensity inducing flight or escape behaviour when applied to the dorsal CG. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen was ineffective. Also, enhancement of endogenous GABA action through local injection of the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and midazolam or of pentobarbital resulted in anti-aversive effects. Ro 15-1788 antagonized both chlordiazepoxide and midazolam, suggesting benzodiazepine receptor mediation. In contrast to pro-GABAergic drugs, microinjection of the GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin into the CG elicited flight behaviour, like the electrical stimulation. Similar experiments with drugs influencing serotonergic neurotransmission evidenced that intra-CG microinjection of serotonin (5-HT) or of the direct 5-HT receptor agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine increased the aversive threshold. The anti-aversive effect of 5-HT was potentiated by the selective inhibitor of 5-HT neuronal uptake, zimelidine. Also, the latter drug increased the aversive threshold when given alone. The anti-aversive effect of 5-HT was antagonized by local pretreatment with either metergoline or ketanserin, the latter being a selective blocker of 5-HT2 receptors. In contrast to the GABA antagonists mentioned above, the 5-HT receptor blockers did not evoke aversive behaviour per se. Therefore, both GABAergic and serotonergic mechanisms are likely to play an inhibitory role in the dorsal CG integrating aversive behaviour. The former seem to act tonically, whereas 5-HT would act in a phasic way. The implications of these results for the pathophysiology and drug treatment of chronic anxiety, panic states and pain disorders are briefly discussed.", 
    "39": "Responding by squirrel monkeys was maintained under a 30-response fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation; during different sessions responding produced either sucrose-flavored or banana-flavored food pellets. Pre-session administration of doses of lithium chloride (LiCl) less than 3.0 mEq/kg did not alter rates of responding whereas pairing either type of pellet with post-session injections of 1.8 mEq/kg LiCl suppressed both lever pressing and consumption during subsequent sessions in which that pellet type was available. When post-session injections of LiCl were discontinued, responding recovered within 14 sessions. The suppression of responding, but not pellet consumption, was then reliably reproduced in each monkey by pairing post-session LiCl with the previously non-paired type of pellet. Pre-session administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDAP, 3.0-17.0 mg/kg) increased rates of suppressed responding in a dose-related manner, but did not increase pellet consumption. These data indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in the suppression of responding and the suppression of consumption of food by post-session injections of drugs. The suppression of responding by post-session injections of drugs in primates appears to be qualitatively similar to the suppression of responding by other noxious stimuli such as electric shock in that it is reversible, it can be reinstated by re-exposure to post-session drug injections, and it can be attenuated by pre-session administration of CDAP.", 
    "40": "In 14 intubated, spontaneously breathing children with body weight (bw) ranging from 8.3 to 25.6 kg, the influence of midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.1, n = 7) and 0.2 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.2, n = 7) as premedication, on sedation, ventilation, ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hormonal stress response was studied in connection with minor surgical procedures during halothane anaesthesia. The concentrations of catecholamines, ACTH and cortisol were measured immediately after induction, during undisturbed anaesthesia, during surgery and 15 min after the end of the surgical procedure. Sedation was better and plasma catecholamine concentrations during undisturbed anaesthesia were less in children receiving the larger dose of midazolam. During surgery and in recovery there were no differences in hormone concentrations. In recovery, the concentrations of all hormones were significantly greater compared with during undisturbed anaesthesia. During surgery, VE and respiratory rate were somewhat lower in group M0.2 while E' CO2 was similar. A dose dependent depression of the response to carbon dioxide was found. However, clinically, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide after surgery was considered to be adequate in both groups.", 
    "41": "Fifty-two patients were enrolled in a four-week randomized multicenter study comparing nitrazepam and corticotropin in the treatment of infantile spasms. The drugs' efficacy was evaluated in 48 patients, all less than 2 years of age. Both treatments resulted in a statistically significant reduction in spasm frequency from that at baseline, but the difference between treatments was not significant. The number of patients who experienced side effects was similar in the two treatment groups, but the adverse effects encountered among the patients treated with corticotropin were qualitatively more severe and required the discontinuation of treatment in six patients.", 
    "42": "Stimulated inositolphospholipid turnover has been proposed to be initiated and sustained by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2], which may be replenished by an enhanced flux of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) to PtdIns 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) to PtdIns(4,5)P2. To determine whether there is continued hydrolysis and resynthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in rat pituitary cells (GH3 cells) during stimulation by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), we investigated the turnover kinetics of the inositolphospholipids and of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). In cells incubated with 32Pi for 1 min, TRH rapidly and persistently (for at least 30 min) enhanced the rate of 32P-labeling of PtdOH. After a lag time of 1 min, TRH markedly and persistently increased 32P-labeling of PtdIns also. In contrast, TRH caused only a transient increase in 32P-labeling of PtdIns(4,5)P2 that lasted less than 2 min. There was no rapid (before 10 min) effect of TRH on 32P-labeling of PtdIns4P. By 2 min of TRH stimulation, specific 32P radioactivity in PtdOH increased from 3.6% (control) of that in the gamma-phosphate of ATP to 15%; in PtdIns, from 0.07% to 1.3%; and in PtdIns(4,5)P2, from 3.8% to 5.4% (specific 32P radioactivity in PtdIns4P was 1.7% of that in ATP in control and TRH-stimulated cells). In cells exposed to TRH for 4 min and then to 32Pi, 32P-labeling of PtdOH and PtdIns increased, but that of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was not affected. Last, persistent turnover of PtdOH and PtdIns was not caused by initial hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 because the turnover of PtdOH and PtdIns could be terminated by displacement of TRH from its receptor by chlordiazepoxide and restarted by reoccupying the receptors with TRH. These data demonstrate that turnover of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is stimulated only transiently, whereas turnover of PtdIns and PtdOH is stimulated persistently by TRH in GH3 cells. Hence, inositolphospholipid turnover in GH3 cells does not occur via continued hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 accompanied by enhanced flux of PtdIns to PtdIns4P to PtdIns(4,5)P2, but there is direct and persistent hydrolysis of PtdIns. The dissociation of these actions suggests that there are separate mechanisms involved in coupling TRH-receptor complexes to stimulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns hydrolysis in GH3 cells.", 
    "43": "We nonselectively interviewed 11 patients aged 3 through 16 years who had survived critical illnesses, including cardiac arrests and profound comas. Any memory of a time they were unconscious was considered to be a near-death experience (NDE) and was recorded. Seven of these children had memories that included being out of the physical body (six patients), entering darkness (five patients), being in a tunnel (four patients), and deciding to return to the body (three patients). We also interviewed 29 age-matched survivors of illnesses that required intubation, narcotics, benzodiazepines, and admission to an intensive care unit. None of them had any memories of the time they were unconscious. In our study population, NDEs were clearly associated with surviving a critical illness. The elements of NDEs reported are similar to those previously described in adults. No children described elements of depersonalization as part of their NDEs. A core NDE, triggered by the process of dying or resuscitation efforts, may be a natural developmental experience. We present a neurophysiologic hypothesis as to the cause of NDEs.", 
    "44": "Uptake of extracellular adenosine was studied in primary cultures of astrocytes or neurons. Both cell types showed a high affinity uptake. The Km values were not significantly different (6.5 +/- 3.75 microM in astrocytes and 6.1 +/- 1.86 microM in neurons), but the intensity of the uptake was higher in astrocytes than in neurons (Vmax values of 0.16 +/- 0.030 and 0.105 +/- 0.010 nmol x min-1 x mg-1 protein, respectively). The temperature sensitivity was similar in the two cell types. Adenosine uptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines inhibited the adenosine uptake systems in both astrocytes and neurons with IC50 values in the high nanomolar or the micromolar range and the rank order of potency was similar in the two cell types. In both cell types the (-) isomers of two sets of benzodiazepine stereoisomers were more potent than the (+) isomers. Dixon analysis showed that dipyridamole, papaverine, hexobendine and chlordiazepoxide inhibited the adenosine uptake competitively and clonazepam noncompetitively in both cell types.",

It was shown that kinetics of excretion of total radioactive material in the urine and feces is a sum of monoexponential processes. Prediction of the compound accumulation in the mouse body during its long-term administration was performed. Parameters of accumulation of the compound, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and phenazepam were compared. Significant, reciprocally compensated changes in relative efficacy and the rate of excretion of total radioactivity in the urine and feces during a long-term administration were noted. It is recommended to take into consideration the events studied at a chronic administration of derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepine.", 
    "46": "Effects of diazepam (DZP) and haloperidol (HAL) given to nursing mothers from the day after delivery to weaning on the behavioral development of their pups were investigated. Weight gain in the pups of mothers that received these drugs did not differ from that in the control pups. Male and female pups exposed to HAL through the milk showed an increase of aggressive behavior (attacking and pinning play) when examined within the social unit of the colony at 4 weeks of age. Although an age-related decrease in this play was observed in the pups of all groups at 7 weeks of age, HAL exposed male and female pups or DZP exposed female pups showed this play more frequently than control pups. At 5 weeks of age, male and female pups exposed to DZP or HAL showed an increase in central ambulation of open-field, in spite of no change in total ambulation. Female pups exposed to DZP or HAL showed an increase of rearing. Female pups exposed to DZP or HAL took more time to reach the goal and made more errors in the maze test at 13-15 weeks of age. Male pups exposed to DZP or HAL showed a decrease in the number of complete mounts. Female pups exposed to DZP or HAL showed a decrease in the number of complete lordoses and an increase in the number of defensive behavior. These results indicate that neuroleptics administered to the dams appear to modify the functioning development of the brain in their offspring.", 
    "47": "Many anecdotal cases have been reported in the literature of dramatic memory impairment after benzodiazepine intake, raising psychobiological, pharmacological and forensic issues. This paper reviews some methodological difficulties encountered in human studies assessing memory function after benzodiazepine intake and the main results of these studies. Subjects studied are seldom insomniacs and the memory tests generally utilized are far from real-life situations. All benzodiazepines at some doses produce decrement in memory performance (anterograde amnesia) with a retrograde facilitation of retrieval, for the tasks learned before benzodiazepine intake. The mechanism of benzodiazepine induced amnesia is far from clear, but it has been shown that long term memory deficit could be the result of failure of memory consolidation due to rapid sleep onset (less than 5 minutes) after memory test performance during the night awakening (Roth et al. 1984). Many questions remain partially or totally unanswered: Is amnesia a specific effect of benzodiazepines? What are their other effects on cognitive functions? Which attitude to have towards a patient when the physician should prescribe a benzodiazepine?", 
    "48": "Sixty outpatients with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with bromazepam, lorazepam or placebo, following a 1-week placebo washout period. There was no significant difference in the anxiolytic effects of bromazepam and lorazepam, both of which were superior to placebo. However, lorazepam-treated patients tended to have a more depressed mood than those treated with bromazepam. Drug-treated patients had consistently less cognitive impairment than those treated with placebo, the difference being statistically significant (P less than .05) in the case of bromazepam. The most frequent side-effects reported with each drug were drowsiness, which tended to subside with time, and depression, which tended to emerge toward the end of the 4-week period. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.64) between age and bromazepam plasma concentration per unit dose, adjusted for weight, and a negative correlation (r = -0.50) between weight and lorazepam plasma concentration per unit dose, adjusted for age.", 
    "49": "In elderly, general surgical patients, oral temazepam 20 mg given in a soft gelatin capsule proved to be a useful light premedicant when given before spinal anaesthesia. In comparison with placebo, it caused preoperative subjective sedation, prevented an increase in heart rate and decreased serum cortisol, but not serum antidiuretic hormone levels. However, simple devices (linear analogue scale, Maddox wing test, critical flicker fusion apparatus) appeared to be quite ineffective in differentiating the clinical effects of temazepam from those of placebo. Temazepam given in a soft gelatin capsule to patients in the supine position had a reasonably fast gastrointestinal absorption, but its blood-lumbar cerebrospinal fluid penetration rate appeared to be quite slow.", 
    "50": "The interaction between four benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, lormetazepam and midazolam) and two nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (vecuronium and atracurium) was investigated in 113 patients during general anaesthesia. Neuromuscular function was monitored by recording the mechanical twitch tension of the adductor pollicis muscle of the thumb in response to ulnar nerve stimulation with single supramaximal stimuli of 0.2 ms at 0.1 Hz. In the first group of patients a benzodiazepine (diazepam 20 mg, lorazepam 5 mg, lormetazepam 2 mg or midazolam 15 mg), was injected i.v. 15 min before a single bolus of vecuronium 45 micrograms kg-1. In the second group of patients suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1 was given for endotracheal intubation, and 30 min later the patients received atracurium 200 micrograms kg-1. Fifteen min before injection of atracurium one of the same benzodiazepines as in the first group was injected i.v. Comparisons were made with control patients receiving thiopentone. Neither benzodiazepine caused significant potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents in comparison with control. With midazolam, however, the duration to 25% and to 75% recovery of the twitch height after vecuronium was significantly longer than with diazepam. The time to 25% recovery of the twitch height after atracurium was significantly longer in patients receiving midazolam than in those receiving diazepam. The recovery index was not influenced by the four benzodiazepines.", 
    "51": "Anxiolytic drugs share many of the common behavioural effects of septal and hippocampal lesions in animals. Gray attributes this to changes which the anxiolytics produce in septal generation of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity. However, lesions of the dorsal ascending noradrenergic bundle reproduce this electrophysiological effect of the anxiolytics while only reproducing part of the behavioural profile of the anxiolytics. The present paper reports what appears to be a second common effect of anxiolytic drugs on the generation of hippocampal slow waves which could underlie their behavioural effects. Freely moving rats, previously implanted with electrodes, received high frequency electrical stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation to elicit hippocampal rhythmic slow activity. The frequency of the slow waves produced increased linearly with increasing stimulation intensity as has been reported previously. A barbiturate (amylobarbitone, 15 mg/kg, i.p.) and three benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, 5 mg/kg; diazepam, 5 mg/kg; alprazolam, 1 mg/kg) all decreased the slope of the voltage-frequency function and decreased overall frequency of slow waves produced. Two antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, 0.2 mg/kg; chlorpromazine, 2 mg/kg) produced similar behavioural sedation to the anxiolytics but did not decrease either the slope of the voltage-frequency function nor the overall frequency of slow waves. The results show that these barbiturates and benzodiazepines produce a common reduction in the frequency of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity. Given the importance attached to slow waves in current theories of hippocampal function, it is possible that this electrophysiological effect could have some relation to the behavioural effects of these anxiolytic drugs. If the effect can be shown to generalize to other classes of anxiolytic drug it could reflect changes in the substrate for the common effects of anxiolytic drugs on behaviour.", 
    "52": "Buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, produced a dose-dependent decrease in the activity of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of freely-moving cats. The response ranged from no significant change at doses of 0.05 mg/kg to a nearly total suppression of activity at 1 mg/kg. These data suggest that the anxiolytic properties of buspirone may be mediated, at least part, by an action on neurons in the dorsal raphe.", 
    "53": "Compulsive gnawing was produced in mice by administration of either methylphenidate or (after sensitizing pretreatment with the neuroleptic, tetflutixol) apomorphine. Drugs which antagonise stereotypy, such as ceruletide (CER, a sulphated decapeptide related to cholecystokinin octapeptide), haloperidol, zuclopenthixol and fluphenazine were applied in equipotent doses (reducing stereotypy by 80%). Clonazepam, muscimol, clonidine and scopolamine (but not methylscopolamine) antagonized to a different extent the antistereotype effect of ceruletide and the neuroleptics. The ED50s for clonazepam and other drugs, were determined; clonazepam had the greatest potency. Regarding the antagonism of the antistereotype effect, ceruletide was similar to but by no means congruent with haloperidol. The antagonism of the antistereotype effect was specific because other effects of ceruletide and cholecystokinin octapeptide (inhibition of exploratory rearing activity, ptosis, antinociception, hypothermia) were not antagonized by clonazepam and only weakly modified by scopolamine. Methylscopolamine was ineffective throughout, indicating a central site for the mechanism of the actions studied of scopolamine. In conclusion, the antistereotype effect of ceruletide is different from that of conventional neuroleptic drugs and functionally independent of other behavioural effects of the cholecystokinin-like peptides.", 
    "54": "Recently, data have been presented showing that muscarinic cholinergic agonists or antagonists can modulate, in opposite ways, GH-releasing hormone GHRH)-induced GH release in man. The aim of the present study was, first, to confirm these findings in the rat and, secondly, if confirmed, to investigate the mechanism(s) subserving the effect of cholinergic drugs. In adult male rats bearing chronic indwelling atrial cannulae, pretreatment with the cholinergic antagonists pirenzepine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) or atropine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the rise in plasma GH induced by GHRH (2 micrograms/kg, i.v.), while pretreatment with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (3 mg/kg, i.v.) potentiated it. In rats with hypothalamic somatostatin (SRIF) depletion, i.e. rats with anterolateral deafferentation of the mediobasal hypothalamus or rats treated with cysteamine, the modulatory action of cholinergic drugs on the neuroendocrine effect of GHRH was completely lacking. In these two experimental models, an antiserum raised against SRIF failed to elicit a rise in plasma GH and measurement of hypothalamic SRIF content revealed a clear-cut reduction of the neuropeptide. Atropine (1 mumol/l) and pilocarpine (1 mumol/l), added to pituitary cells in vitro, failed to alter GHRH-induced GH release. The present results indicate that muscarinic cholinergic agonists and antagonists modulate GHRH-induced GH release in the rat and suggest that the effect of cholinergic modulation takes place through SRIF.", 
    "55": "Investigations into the mechanisms and characteristics of ischemic heart disease have increasingly documented evidence of myocardial ischemia in the absence of symptoms. Recent work using objective criteria of ischemic episodes confirmed that angina pectoris or its equivalents need not accompany myocardial ischemia and noted that these episodes appear to be quite common. The impact on prognosis awaits further study, but preliminary data suggest an adverse prognosis for patients with recurrent spontaneous silent vasoconstrictive ischemia. Furthermore, treatment of silent ischemic episodes with nitrates may be associated with reduced ischemia. Preliminary trials show reduction of the number, duration, and magnitude of silent ischemic episodes by transdermal nitroglycerin given to patients receiving beta-blockers. Therapy of acute ischemic syndromes should be designed to eliminate ischemia completely, not merely ameliorate pain.", 
    "56": "Addition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to antral mucosal fragments in short-term incubation results in dose-dependent and bicuculline-sensitive stimulation of gastrin release and inhibition of somatostatin release, respectively. These effects of GABA on antral gastrin and somatostatin release closely resembled the actions of cholinergic agonists on G- and D-cell function. The present study examines the possibility that the effects of GABA on antral peptide release may be mediated, in part, through stimulation of antral cholinergic neurons. Inclusion of either atropine or pirenzepine in incubation medium prevented GABA-induced stimulation of gastrin release and inhibition of somatostatin release. Addition of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine, caused a leftward shift in the GABA dose-response curve and increased by 10-fold the sensitivity of the antral preparation to GABA stimulation. Studies with tetrodotoxin suggest that GABA-stimulated gastrin release is mediated through activation of neurons contained within the antral mucosal/submucosal fragments. Hexamethonium, the ganglionic nicotinic receptor antagonist, did not affect GABA-induced gastrin release. These results indicate that GABA affects antral gastrin and somatostatin release through stimulation of antral postganglionic cholinergic neurons.", 
    "57": "The demonstrations that Ro 5-4864, a ligand selective for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site, inhibited cellular differentiation and proliferation and that occupancy of the peripheral-type BZD binding site likely mediated the observed BZD effects on diverse endocrine tissues suggested that Ro 5-4864 disrupted a common cellular regulatory event. Using a well-characterized anterior pituitary-derived tumor cell line (AtT-20 cells), which synthesizes and secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-lipotropin hormone (beta-LPH), and beta-endorphin (BE), we have investigated the molecular mechanism of action of Ro 5-4864's capacity to alter BE secretion. Ro 5-4864 inhibits basal and induced BE release from AtT-20 cells, through a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism. Ro 5-4864 completely blocked the corticotropin-releasing hormone and forskolin-induced release of BE without altering the concomitant production of cyclic AMP. The addition to AtT-20 cells of CGP 28392, a dihydropyridine that has been demonstrated in other systems to specifically activate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, resulted in a cyclic AMP-independent, dose-related increase in BE secretion. This CGP-induced BE release was blocked by increasing concentrations of Ro 5-4864. In contrast to the capacity of Ro 5-4864 to block CGP-induced BE release, Ro 5-4864 lacked the capacity to block enhanced BE secretion due to the calcium ionophore A23187, which increases intracellular Ca2+ levels independent of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Our findings suggest that Ro 5-4864 inhibits BE secretion from AtT-20 cells through a blockade of the voltage-dependent membrane Ca2+ channels and this mechanism of action may be responsible for Ro 5-4864's diverse effects observed on other cell types.", 
    "58": "A novel analytical methodology was developed for simultaneous high-performance liquid chromatographic quantitation of antipyrine and lorazepam in biological fluids using phenacetin and flunitrazepam as internal standards, respectively. A gradient solvent system was used to achieve specificity and sensitivity for each of the compounds in biological fluids. The between-run coefficients of variation for replicate analysis of antipyrine and lorazepam in identical plasma samples were 9.4 and 6.4% at 60 micrograms/ml and 5.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, for antipyrine, and 9.1 and 9.9% at 110 ng/ml and 10.5 ng/ml, respectively, for lorazepam. Accuracy ranged from 99.7 to 101.4% at concentrations of 8, 45 and 105 micrograms/ml for antipyrine and from 94.8 to 95.8% at concentrations of 12, 55 and 125 ng/ml for lorazepam. This method requires only one organic extraction procedure for all four compounds, allows quantitation of these two drugs in samples also containing indocyanine green, and sample throughput following extraction is totally automated.", 
    "59": "A selective and highly sensitive capillary gas chromatographic method was developed for the determination of a benzodiazepine antagonist in human plasma. The analytical procedure involved extraction of the compound and its internal standard from basified plasma with n-butyl chloride-dichloromethane and chromatography of the extract on a DB-5 fused-silica column (30 m X 0.25 mm I.D.), applying automated splitless injection and nitrogen- phosphorus detection. The limit of quantification was about 50 pg/ml, using a 1-ml plasma specimen. The mean inter-assay precision was 2.6% in the concentration range 0.5-10 ng/ml. The method was shown to be specific with respect to various benzodiazepines and their main metabolites. The practicability of the method was demonstrated by the analysis of more than 300 plasma samples from a dose proportionality study performed with human volunteers. Owing to its high sensitivity, the new method can be used to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters of the benzodiazepine antagonist in man after doses near the envisaged therapeutic intravenous dose of less than 1 mg.", 
    "60": "The distribution of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the cerebella of normal mice and Purkinje cell degeneration mutant mice was studied by light microscopic autoradiography. In the cerebellar cortex of normal mice, a high density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was observed over the molecular layer, an intermediate density over the Purkinje cell layer and a low density over the granule cell layer; the white matter was devoid of labeling. The deep cerebellar nuclei were labeled to an intermediate density. In the 54-day-old Purkinje cell degeneration mutant cerebellum, which is depleted of Purkinje cells, a 36% reduction in labeling density of the cerebellar cortex was observed. The density was reduced by approximately equal amounts in both the molecular and granule cell layers; labeling in the deep cerebellar nuclei was, however, substantially increased.", 
    "61": "Muscarinic receptors were identified in membrane preparations from bovine cerebral arteries by the specific binding of [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate. The total amount of binding sites is relatively high: 1.5 pmol/mg protein, as compared to 0.91 pmol/mg for bovine cerebral cortex and 0.08 pmol/mg for heart muscle. In this study we show that the majority of these sites correspond to M2-receptors: 84% of the sites display low affinity for pirenzepine. In addition, GTP causes a rightward shift and steepening of the carbachol competition binding curve. In the presence of GTP, the alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide causes a 28-fold increase of the affinity for carbachol. This phenomenon is also observed on bovine heart membranes where muscarinic receptors are known to be of the M2 type. In contrast, muscarinic receptors in cerebral cortex, predominantly of the M1-type, show only a 4-fold increase in agonist affinity by N-ethylmaleimide. These findings suggest that the ability of N-ethylmaleimide to modulate the agonist affinity is an additional criterion for the characterization of muscarinic M2-type receptors.", 
    "62": "Ifoxetine (CGP 15210 G; (+/-)-bis-[cis-3-hydroxy-4-(2,3-dimethyl-phenoxy)]-piperidine sulfate) prevented the depletion of serotonin (5-HT) induced by H 75/12 and p-chloromethamphetamine in the rat brain, and that caused by endogenously released dopamine after the combined administration of haloperidol and amfonelic acid in the rat striatum. These effects are typically caused by compounds that inhibit 5-HT reuptake. Unexpectedly, ifoxetine only weakly inhibited the uptake of radiolabelled 5-HT into rat brain synaptosomes in vitro or ex vivo, the human thrombocytes in vitro or into rat thrombocytes after pretreatment. The following, among the possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy, were considered and regarded as unlikely: the involvement of an active metabolite; the possibility that ifoxetine accumulates in the brain to an extent sufficient to cause in vivo uptake inhibition; a pharmacokinetic interaction with the depleting agents. The possibility that the depletor tests give false positives was also considered. However, ifoxetine lowered brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and reduced the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan after central decarboxylase inhibition. This suggests that it also interferes with 5-HT metabolism in the absence of depleting agents, which means that it interacts in some way with serotonergic transmission. Ifoxetine displayed weak or no interactions with 5-HT1, 5-HT2, alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-noradrenoceptors, histamine H1, muscarinic acetylcholine, opiate, GABA A, and benzodiazepine receptors in vitro, and with dopamine and 5-HT2 receptors in vivo. It did not antagonize the noradrenaline (NA) depletion induced by H 77/77 in rat brain and only weakly interfered with the uptake of i.v. injected radiolabelled NA into the rat heart. This suggests that its interaction with the 5-HT system is specific. Due to its atypical properties, among which the rather weak potentiation of the neurological effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan is also important, ifoxetine may exhibit a therapeutic and/or side-effect profile which differs from that of classical 5-HT uptake inhibitors.", 
    "63": "Chronic alcoholic gastritis is a very important social problem in the Health District of Arezzo, which covers an area where wine is an integral part of the diet. The etiology of this disease is related to the alcohol induced rupture of the gastric mucosal barrier. For this reason we wanted to verify the therapeutic effect of a \"barrier acting drug\" such as pirenzepine. A selected group of 50 randomized patients (46 males and 4 females, mean age 52.6 years) received in a double blind fashion 50 mg b.i.d. of pirenzepine or placebo for consecutive 4 weeks. Endoscopy and histological examinations performed before and after treatment together with the clinical evaluation of the dyspeptic symptoms, showed that pirenzepine was more active than placebo. In addition our results suggest that pirenzepine stimulates defence mechanisms of the gastric mucosa.", 
    "64": "Despite a 34% decrease in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the rat cerebral cortex following lesions of the nucleus basalis, there were no changes in the Bmax of the antagonist ligands [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ((-)-[3H]QNB) or (-)-[3H]N-methylscopolamine ((-)-[3H]NMS). Furthermore, this treatment produced no significant change in the proportions or affinities of muscarinic receptors having high and low affinity for pirenzepine or (-)-NMS. These data indicate that putative M2 muscarinic receptors are not restricted to ChAT-containing neurons in rat cerebral cortex. In senescent compared to mature rats there was no significant loss of ChAT activity although a significant reduction in the Bmax of both (-)-[3H]QNB and (-)-[3H]NMS binding was observed. However, no changes in the competition of pirenzepine or (-)-NMS for the remaining (-)-[3H]QNB binding sites were observed. Therefore, there is no evidence for any differential regulation of either putative muscarinic receptor subtype in response to cholinergic deafferentation or as a function of the natural aging process.", 
    "65": "An arylaminopyridazine derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), SR 95103, has been shown to be a selective antagonist of GABA at the GABAA receptor site. Subsequent structure-activity studies showed that suppressing the methyl in the 4-position of the pyridazine ring, and substituting the phenyl ring at the para position with a chlorine (SR 42641) or a methoxy group (SR 95531) led to compounds which exhibited the highest affinities for the GABA receptor site in this series. In the present study we examined the biochemical interaction of these compounds with the GABA receptor as well as their biochemical selectivity for this receptor. SR 95531 and SR 42641 displaced [3H]GABA from rat brain membranes with apparent Ki values of 0.15 microM and 0.28 microM respectively and Hill numbers near 1.0. The two compounds antagonized the GABA-elicited enhancement of [3H]diazepam-binding in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting [3H]diazepam-binding per se. Scatchard and Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the interaction of the two compounds with the GABAA receptor sites, revealed that the compounds were competitive at the high affinity site, but non-competitive at the low affinity site. Neither compound interacted with other GABAergic processes or with a variety of central receptor sites. When administered intravenously, SR 95531 and SR 42641 elicited tonic-clonic seizures in mice. Based on these results, it is postulated that SR 95531 and SR 42641 are specific, potent and competitive GABAA antagonists.", 
    "66": "The effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on the release of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) were investigated in synaptosomes prepared from rat cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus and depolarized with 15 mM KCl under superfusion conditions. ACh inhibited the release of [3H]5-HT in all three brain areas. This effect was not modified by hexamethonium but was antagonized by atropine and by the non-classical antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine.", 
    "67": "GABA ratios were measured in several brain regions in sham-operated, adrenalectomized and adrenalectomized dexamethasone-injected rats. In sham-operated animals, GABA ratios varied 2.5-fold among the regions. In adrenalectomized animals the GABA ratios were increased in the hypothalamus and striatum but decreased in the hippocampus. Dexamethasone injection into adrenalectomized animals reversed the increased GABA ratio in the striatum. These data indicate that glucocorticoids can modulate GABA ratios, possibly by affecting the availability of the individual receptors in the receptor complex.", 
    "68": "We have previously described the synthesis of a novel compound, 3-(methoxycarbonyl)-amino-beta-carboline (beta-CMC), which has a high in vitro affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor. In vivo testing showed that this compound had a restricted pharmacological profile. beta-CMC lacked intrinsic activity but it antagonized the convulsions induced by the methyl ester of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. Moreover, beta-CMC selectively antagonized the sedative but not the anxiolytic or anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines. The possible mechanisms involved in the selective antagonism of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines by beta-CMC are discussed.", 
    "69": "A computer-based prescription retrieval system was used to study 21,521 prescriptions that had been provided to hospital patients who were receiving predominantly outpatient care. Over a three-month period 338 patients were found to be receiving 10 or more different drugs concomitantly. A further 338 patients were drawn at random from the same outpatient population for comparison. Age was linked significantly to polypharmacy (polypharmacy group: mean age, 63.7 years, SEM = 1.09; comparison group: mean age, 53.8 years, SEM = 1.00, P less than 0.05; chi 2 = 62.8, P less than 0.001). The relative risk of polypharmacy was related linearly to age. Admission to hospital was associated with increased prescribing rates in the polypharmacy sample (P less than 0.05), as was attendance at multiple clinics and multiple attendance at outpatient clinics (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.05, respectively). Benzodiazepine agents were included in 63.7% of prescriptions in the polypharmacy group and in 37.3% of prescriptions in the comparison group. Non-prescription drugs were noted in 97.2% of prescriptions in the polypharmacy group and 58.0% of prescriptions in the comparison group, representing 34.7% and 27.3% of all items, respectively. In patients of less than 30 years of age agents for allergy/asthma/atopy contributed most to polypharmacy; agents that were associated with renal failure most in patients aged 31-50 years; and agents for cardiovascular disease contributed most in patients aged over 50 years. Our results suggest that a reduction in the use of non-prescription and psychotropic agents, heightened awareness of the dangers of polypharmacy and coordination and integration of over-all care and prescribing habits should reduce polypharmacy materially.", 
    "70": "The prescribing of drugs in the therapeutic classes that are affected by the government's limited list was investigated in a computerised group practice of just over 3,000 patients. Prescribable drugs in categories that are affected by the list were identified for two consecutive six month periods before and one six month period after the introduction of the list. A significant decrease in the prescribing of cough and cold remedies, vitamins, and antacids occurred after the list was introduced, whereas no change occurred in the prescribing of laxatives, benzodiazepines, or analgesics. The prescribing of iron and penicillin increased significantly after the list was introduced, whereas the use of H2 antagonists and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no significant change.", 
    "71": "A 44-year-old obese female patient ingested 200 mg diazepam and 1000 mg atenolol with suicidal intent. On admission to the clinic 24 hours later she was in deep coma, with a body temperature of 28.9 degrees C. The blood level of atenolol was 250 mg/l (therapeutic range 0.2-0.5 mg/l); this is the highest level yet recorded. She was treated with gastric lavage, instillation of charcoal and with orciprenaline, dopamine and dobutamine. She survived the poisoning without any untoward sequelae.", 
    "72": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trail in which 40 patients who had undergone long-term therapy with benzodiazepines were switched to placebo or to diazepam in a dose approximately equivalent to their usual dose of the benzodiazepine; the dose of diazepam was then tapered during an eight-week period. Patients were assessed clinically and psychologically and had weekly sessions of behavioral therapy. The subjects who received placebo had more symptoms, assessed their symptoms as more severe, and stopped taking the study drug at a higher rate than those receiving the tapering doses of diazepam. The subjects in the placebo group also had symptoms shortly after being switched to placebo, whereas those in the diazepam group had symptoms much later. Some withdrawal symptoms were distinct from those of anxiety (e.g., tinnitus, involuntary movement, and perceptual changes). Withdrawal symptoms occurred earlier in patients who had received short-acting benzodiazepines than in those who had received long-acting benzodiazepines. Symptoms gradually disappeared over a four-week period in both the placebo and the diazepam groups. Serial determination of plasma benzodiazepine concentrations was a useful way to assess compliance, treatment outcome, and relapse during withdrawal. We conclude that a clinically important, mild, but distinct withdrawal syndrome occurs after discontinuation of long-term therapeutic use of benzodiazepines."
