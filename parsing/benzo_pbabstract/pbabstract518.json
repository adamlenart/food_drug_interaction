Plasma level decrease rapidly thereafter reaching barely detectable levels by four hours. The onset of signs of flumazenil precipitated abstinence in diazepam-dependent dogs is well correlated with the rise of flumazenil plasma levels, however, precipitated abstinence seizures occur when plasma levels have markedly decreased. Oral dosing is a more efficient way of administering flumazenil than gastric fistula dosing.", 
    "1": "The possibility that 5-HT2 receptors mediate the reinforcing properties of d-amphetamine, morphine and diazepam was investigated in rats, using ritanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, and the conditioned place preference paradigm. Ritanserin 1 or 2.5 mg/kg did not cause place conditioning. Place preference induced by 1.5 mg/kg d-amphetamine and 2 mg/kg morphine was inhibited and attenuated respectively by pretreatment with 2.5 mg/kg ritanserin. Diazepam- (1 mg/kg) induced place preference was completely blocked by both doses of ritanserin. Ritanserin pretreatment failed to influence amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, morphine-induced analgesia and diazepam-induced increased open arm exploration of rats on the elevated plus maze. These data are discussed in terms of (a) the possibility that serotoninergic mechanisms have a role in mediating reinforcement and (b) the relationship between appetitive properties and specific behavioral effects of psychostimulants, opiates and anxiolytics.", 
    "2": "In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial were studied the efficacy and safety of Flumazenil (Anexate) administered postoperatively for reversing the central effects of midazolam. Fifty-nine patients were sedated with midazolam for surgery under epidural or spinal anaesthesia. At the end of operations Flumazenil was i.v. injected in incremental doses up to the awakening of the patient or to a maximal dose of 1 mg. The parameters of efficacy (degree of sedation, amnesia, orientation and collaboration) and safety (vital signs, vital capacity), adverse reactions and the patient's subjective assessment were recorded up to 240 min after the injection of the trial drug. With efficacious doses of 0.2 mg-0.4 mg the Flumazenil group showed a significant improvement in collaboration and in reversing sedation and amnesia up to 30 min after the injection of the antagonist. The relatively short duration of action of Flumazenil can lead to secondary sleep and amnesia episodes. The vital signs remained stable after the administration of the trial drug. Patients assessed their subjective satisfaction on the awakening. There were no severe adverse reactions after Flumazenil.", 
    "3": "The pharmacokinetics of alfentanil, midazolam and thiopentone used for induction of short general anaesthesia were studied in 55 gynaecological outpatients. All the patients received midazolam as premedication. The patients received intravenous anaesthesia with alfentanil and either thiopentone or midazolam, supplemented with either nitrous oxide or air in oxygen ventilation, reversed by the end of anaesthesia with either placebo or flumazenil. Blood sampling for serum concentration measurements of midazolam, alfentanil and thiopentone was performed regularly for 7 h. The following mean pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- s.e. mean) were calculated for midazolam and alfentanil, respectively: elimination half-life 3.9 +/- 0.3 h and 1.2 +/- 0.05 h, apparent volume of distribution 107 +/- 61 and 31 +/- 1.5 l, total body clearance 20 +/- 0.7 l/h and 18 +/- 0.8 l/h. No influence of flumazenil on the kinetics of midazolam and no influence of thiopentone, midazolam, flumazenil or nitrous oxide on the kinetics of alfentanil was found. The serum levels of thiopentone were below the detection limit of the assay after 60 min, which made an evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters impossible. Significant positive correlations were found in the individual patient between midazolam and alfentanil for all pharmacokinetic variables evaluated. For midazolam, an increase in the elimination half-life and the apparent volume of distribution was positively correlated to an increase of body-weight. For alfentanil, a decrease in the total body clearance and an increase in the elimination half-life were positively correlated to an increase of age. A prolonged elimination half-life of alfentanil was positively correlated to use of alcohol. High serum levels of thiopentone were positively correlated to increasing age of the patients.", 
    "4": "Postoperative performance following total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) using midazolam and alfentanil was studied with and without the administration of a single dose of a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788). Performance was compared with a reference group anaesthetized with thiopentone, alfentanil and nitrous oxide. All patients were assessed by use of a rating scale which took into account the degree of sedation, amnesia, comprehension and cooperation as well as temporal and spatial orientation. There was a slow recovery following TIVA with somnolence and amnesia lasting several hours. Administration of flumazenil 1.0 mg i.v. at extubation caused a significant reduction of sedation (P less than 0.001) during the first postoperative hour, with patients fully awake or only lightly sedated, but was later followed by resedation. The patients of the reference group were moderately sedated during the observation period. Five and six hours postoperatively there was no difference between the groups. Amnesia was more profound in the groups that received midazolam; the effect of the antagonist could only be seen for 15 min after its administration. Comprehension and cooperation, as well as orientation, were equally good in the antagonist and in the reference group during the immediate postoperative period, whereas in the TIVA group a gradual improvement over the first hours was seen. In the antagonist group there was no increase in the number of analgesic requirements, no anxiety attacks or other adverse effects. It is concluded that flumazenil offers an improvement in postoperative performance following TIVA induced by midazolam and alfentanil, but the effects are of short duration.", 
    "5": "Fifty-nine male patients scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate under flunitrazepam sedation and spinal analgesia were randomized in a double-blind trial to reversal of sedation with either the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil or placebo. Judged by degree of sedation, comprehension and cooperation as well as by estimation of orientation in time and space, flumazenil was superior to placebo (P less than 0.001). The median duration of anterograde amnesia was 16 min after flumazenil and 75 min after placebo (P less than 0.001). Adverse events were more frequent with placebo (P greater than 0.05), while no differences were evident with regard to laboratory data or cardiorespiratory function.", 
    "6": "Our earlier biochemical studies suggested that the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS) may reduce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action at the Cl- channel associated with GABAA receptors. In the present electrophysiological study the interaction of PS with the GABAA receptor was tested, using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from isolated cerebral cortical neurons of neonatal rats. At micromolar concentrations PS reversibly inhibited GABA-induced current, behaving as an allosteric receptor antagonist.", 
    "7": "Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs widely employed as anxiolytics and anticonvulsants, can induce impairments of learning and memory. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), could enhance learning and memory. Pretraining injection of flumazenil (2.5 to 40.0 mg/kg) was found to enhance both learning and memory in a test requiring young mice to discriminate the correct arm of a T-maze to escape mild electric shock. In a second test, which required mice to passively avoid a dark chamber after shock, flumazenil pretreatment prevented the occurrence of amnesia induced by the cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine. It is hypothesized that flumazenil may facilitate learning or memory processes by reversing a negative modulatory influence of endogenous diazepam-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "8": "Etomidate and propofol were compared for induction of anesthesia in a controlled study, including 24 male patients (ASA groups I and II). Following oral premedication with lormetazepam, the patients received propofol (2.5 mg kg-1; n = 12) or etomidate (0.3 mg kg-1; n = 12) over 60 s. For statistical analysis of the cardiovascular data (blood pressure and heart rate) four blocks were set up: A, baseline value including atropine dosage; B, value after induction of anesthesia; C, value after administration of halothane and vecuronium before intubation; D, value after intubation. The blood pressure fell slightly on administration of propofol while the heart rate remained nearly unchanged. Etomidate was associated with unacceptably high increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Myoclonia occurred in seven patients after etomidate and in two patients after propofol. A smoother mask ventilation was rated as a further advantage of propofol. Because of the unfavorable cardiovascular profile, the occurrence of myoclonia and poor mask ventilation, etomidate proved to be unsuitable for induction of anesthesia unless supplemented by an opioid and/or benzodiazepine. The high incidence of pain upon injection was considered to be a disadvantage of propofol.", 
    "9": "Some researchers have recently suggested that antidepressants may be superior to benzodiazepines in the alleviation of generalized anxiety. In a 6-week, double-blind, parallel-design study with flexible dosage scheduling, the authors compared the effects of alprazolam with those of imipramine in 60 patients who had generalized anxiety disorder. On rating scales that contained both psychic and somatic symptoms, patients in both treatment groups improved to a similar degree after 2 weeks. However, alprazolam was more effective in attenuating somatic symptoms, and imipramine was more effective in attenuating psychic symptoms such as dysphoria and negative anticipatory thinking. The authors' results suggest that, in generalized anxiety, somatic symptoms and hyperarousal selectively respond to drugs acting on the gamma-aminobutyric acid system, whereas psychic symptoms respond to treatments affecting the noradrenergic or serotonergic systems.", 
    "10": "In order to better understand the antagonistic effects of the partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, RO 15-4513, against the disinhibitory action of ethanol, we examined the effects of RO 15-4513 at a dose (2.0 mg/kg) that did not alter locomotor activity, given alone or in combination with ethanol, on the behavior of mice confronted with the light/dark choice procedure and the staircase test. At this dose, RO 15-4513 given alone was found to have slight anxiogenic properties and when given in combination with ethanol, to completely reverse the disinhibitory effects of ethanol. Since we previously observed postictal depression after higher doses of RO 15-4513 given alone and antagonistic effects of these same doses on the action of ethanol, it can be suggested that the antagonistic effects of RO 15-4513 against ethanol are due to its anxiogenic or depressive properties depending on doses. However, this hypothesis can only be regarded as being in early stages of development at the present time since these results do not parallel with those of several other studies and the question whether the antagonistic action of RO 15-4513 against ethanol is additive or interactive remains open.", 
    "11": "The effects of benzodiazepines (BDZs) and GABA system on tonic and clonic component of postdecapitation convulsion (PDC) were studied in mice. Mice decapitated at the occipito-cervical junction, exerted biphasic convulsions, i.e., initially tonic and subsequently clonic convulsions. BDZs such as diazepam or clonazepam increased tonic and clonic components of PDC. These effects were not antagonized by Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The increased tonic component was antagonized by the GABA receptor antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, whereas the clonic component was augmented by them. Aminooxyacetic acid, which increases the endogenous GABA content by inhibiting the GABA-transaminase, increased the tonic component significantly; this increase was antagonized by both bicuculline and picrotoxin. Muscimol, a GABA agonist, however did not affect the tonic components but rather augmented the clonic component. Bicuculline and picrotoxin did not antagonize this effect of muscimol. These results indicate that endogenous GABA may play a crucial role in mediating the tonic component of PDC and the facilitation of this component by BDZs may also be due to the activation of GABA in the spinal cord. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the tonic component may be different from that of the clonic component.", 
    "12": "1. Effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol (40, 80 and 160 mg) and atenolol (50 and 100 mg) on the electroencephalogram and on body sway, were studied in 12 healthy male subjects. The study was double-blind, and included two placebos and an active control, oxazepam (15 mg). Medication was ingested at 11.00 h, and assessments were made before, and at 2 h and 4 h after ingestion. 2. All doses of both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists modified the electroencephalogram, and the changes reported were statistically significant at probability levels of less than 5%. The circadian rise in alpha activity was reduced by both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists as well as by oxazepam. Atenolol also decreased beta activity. 3. Body sway was modified by atenolol and oxazepam (P less than 0.05). The increase with oxazepam was most marked in the low frequency component (0.05-2.25 Hz) of the spectrum, while atenolol modified only the component of higher frequency (2.25-4.0 Hz). 4. These observations suggest that propranolol and atenolol have a sedative effect, and that hydrophilic antagonists are unlikely to be free of central activity. The changes in body sway could imply that peripheral mechanisms may be modified at least with atenolol.", 
    "13": "1. Central effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol (40, 80 and 160 mg) and atenolol (50 and 100 mg) were studied in 12 healthy male subjects. Two placebo ingestions and an active control (oxazepam 15 mg) were included. Single doses were administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and assessments of performance and subjective feelings were made before, 2 h and 4 h after ingestion. 2. Performance was measured using letter cancellation, digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, choice reaction time, finger tapping, short term and immediate memory, critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjective feelings were assessed using twelve visual-analogue scales. 3. Oxazepam impaired performance at letter cancellation (P less than 0.001), digit symbol substitution (P less than 0.05), continuous attention (P less than 0.001), immediate recall (P less than 0.05) and finger tapping (P less than 0.05), but neither of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists affected these measures. Propranolol (40 and 160 mg) also impaired short term memory (P less than 0.05), though it was not possible to establish this effect with atenolol. 4. Subjective alertness was reduced by oxazepam (P less than 0.01) and atenolol (P less than 0.05), while propranolol (40 mg) reduced anxiety (P less than 0.01) and propranolol (80 mg) impaired ability to concentrate (P less than 0.05). 5. The results suggest that both lipophilic and hydrophilic antagonists modify the central nervous system, though impairment may be difficult to establish with conventional tests. The observations on memory and alertness suggest that the central effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be subtle.", 
    "14": "During an expedition to the Himalayas, we studied the sleep and respiration of six climbers. Three ingested acetazolamide (500 mg) daily throughout the climb and the other three ingested placebo. At high altitude (4,150-4,846 m), each subject ingested temazepam (10 mg) for one night and placebo for another. Acetazolamide improved sleep above 2,750 m, but it is uncertain whether this was due to sedation or to improvements in arterial oxygen saturation. Sleep was markedly disturbed in all subjects above 4,000 m. Temazepam improved sleep, and in subjects taking acetazolamide, it reduced sleep-onset latencies and increased sleep efficiency close to that of sea level values. These observations suggest that the prophylactic use of acetazolamide is likely to improve sleep in climbers and that a low dose of a benzodiazepine such as temazepam (10 mg) may be beneficial at high altitude. Studies are now needed to exclude any possibility of respiratory impairment at altitude before a firm recommendation can be made regarding the routine use of this hypnotic.", 
    "15": "Two ergot derivatives, lisuride and quinpirole, were examined for their ability to antagonize hyperbaric oxygen-induced (5 ATA O2) convulsions in mice. Significant protection was obtained by lisuride (25-400 micrograms.kg-1, i.p.) and quinpirole (100-200 micrograms.kg-1, i.p.). The efficacy was found to be about 50% of the protection obtained by diazepam (4 mg.kg-1, i.p.). Both lisuride and quinpirole significantly reduced rectal temperature at all doses administered. In separate experiments, at normal atmospheric conditions, all drugs to some extent reduced estimated respiratory minute volume. Taking these effects into account, lisuride is considerably more active as an anticonvulsant than quinpirole.", 
    "16": "Ro 15-1788, a selective benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist, is known to precipitate withdrawal reactions in BZD-pretreated animals. We examined whether a high dose of Ro 15-1788 can precipitate withdrawal reactions relating to behavior and changes in the stress-hormone plasma levels after acute BZD treatment in man. On two consecutive days, 15 min and 24 h respectively after a single treatment with either lormetazepam (0.06 mg/kg: LMZ group), flunitrazepam (0.03 mg/kg: FNZ group) or placebo (PLA group), 18 healthy volunteers received two injections of Ro 15-1788 (0.01 mg/kg). Behavioral responses (mood changes, anxiety), cortisol and prolactin plasma levels, and physiological parameters were examined. In all groups there were only slight changes in the circulation parameters. Minor anxiety reactions were seen after Ro 15-1788, which occurred the 1st day in the PLA group and the 2nd day in the BZD groups. Depression was noted especially in the FNZ group after both injections of Ro 15-1788. The physiological morning decrease in cortisol plasma level was influenced on the 1st day in the LMZ group (2 volunteers showed high plasma levels) and the 2nd day in the FNZ group: a slight increase of cortisol plasma level was measured after the 2nd injection of Ro 15-1788. Prolactin plasma levels arose immediately after LMZ injection and continued to increase after Ro 15-1788 injection. No increase in prolactin plasma levels was found in the other groups or in the LMZ group after the 2nd challenge by Ro 15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Oral slow release morphine 30 mg and temazepam 30 mg given as premedication 2 hours before operation were compared in 62 patients who underwent extraction of four third molar teeth in a randomised double-blind trial. There was no significant difference in pre-operative sedation; the majority were mildly or moderately sedated. Patients in the morphine group woke up significantly faster and had significantly reduced requirements for analgesics after operation.", 
    "18": "Pentobarbital and phenobarbital exhibited anticonvulsant effects against picrotoxin (10 mg/kg, IP) as well as against strychnine (4 mg/kg, IP). Pentobarbital was also effective against bicuculline whereas only hypnotic doses of phenobarbital provided some protection against bicuculline- (8 mg/kg, IP) induced convulsions. Diazepam as well as THIP, but not baclofen, were also effective against all the three chemoconvulsants. Baclofen or subeffective doses of diazepam or THIP, when combined with subeffective dose of pentobarbital exhibited anticonvulsant activity against all the chemoconvulsants studied. On the other hand, a combination of subeffective doses of these agents with subeffective doses of phenobarbital provided protection only against picrotoxin and strychnine. These observations indicate that pentobarbital is quite effective against convulsions caused by agents acting at picrotoxin site, GABAA receptor or glycine receptor whereas phenobarbital is effective only against agents acting at picrotoxin site and glycine receptor, and is very weak anticonvulsant against agents causing blockade of GABAA receptors. Furthermore, activation of GABAA receptors or benzodiazepine receptors also provide protection against agents acting at GABAergic system or glycine receptors. On the contrary, activation of only GABAB receptors is inadequate to provide the protective effect. However, the activation of GABAA as well as GABAB receptors facilitate the anticonvulsant effect of both the barbiturates. Furthermore, pentobarbital, but not phenobarbital, facilitates the anticonvulsant effect of benzodiazepines against chemoconvulsants acting at GABAergic site or glycine receptors.", 
    "19": "Inescapable tailshock has been shown to elicit a tissue specific decrease in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR). We have now explored possible mechanisms that may be responsible for this phenomenon. An 80 minute session of inescapable tailshock produced a reduction in the binding of [3H] Ro5-4864 to renal membranes at 0, 1 and 2 hr after stress, with values returning to control (naive) levels within 24 hr. In cardiac membranes, statistically significant reductions were observed only at 2 and 4 hr after stress. The role of the pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system in this phenomenon was assessed by subjecting adrenalectomized, hypophysectomized, 6-OHDA-treated or control (sham-operated or saline-treated) rats to inescapable shock. Neither adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy, nor 6-OHDA pretreatment altered the stress-induced reduction in renal PBR. However, the stress-induced decrease in renal PBR was blocked by pretreatment with clonazepam (1 mg/kg), a potent anxiolytic with low affinity for PBR.", 
    "20": "We studied the effect of the benzodiazepine derivative alprazolam on [3H]-flunitrazepam binding with a brain synaptosomal fraction of experimental animals in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo experiments were carried out in intact cats and mice with social isolation. Alprazolam did not change the density of benzodiazepine receptors in intact animals, but restored their number, strongly reduced in a model of social aggression.", 
    "21": "Administration of the beta-carboline alkaloid, harmaline, causes the neurons of the inferior olive to fire synchronously and to act as a pacemaker for the generation of tremor. Rats treated daily with harmaline showed a progressive loss of drug-induced tremor. This tolerance was long-lasting and specific. No cross-tolerance was noted to the drug oxotremorine. Prevention or attenuation of tremor by pretreatment with diazepam or morphine preserved the tremorogenic capacity of harmaline when administered alone. These results suggest a relatively permanent change in the olivo-cerebello-bulbar pathway that underlies the generation of tremor induced by harmaline. Treatment with harmaline also increased cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the cerebellum, presumably through activation of the climbing fiber pathway from the inferior olive to the cerebellar cortex. These increases were attenuated after repeated treatment. These results suggest that the site of tolerance to the tremogenic effects of harmaline lies within the olivo-cerebellar system.", 
    "22": "1. The interaction of substituted benzamides with brain benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding sites was examined by their ability to displace [3H]-flunitrazepam ([3H]-FNM) from specific binding sites in bovine cortical membranes in vitro. 2. Clebopride, Delagrange 2674, Delagrange 2335 and BRL 20627 displayed concentration-dependent displacement of [3H]-FNM with IC50 values of 73 nM, 132 nM, 7.7 microM and 5.9 microM, respectively. Other substituted benzamides including metoclopramide, sulpiride, tiapride, sultopride and cisapride were inactive at 10(-5) M. 3. Inhibition by clebopride and Delagrange 2674 of [3H]-FNM binding was apparently competitive and readily reversible. 4. In the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the ability of diazepam and Delagrange 2674 to displace [3H]-Ro 15-1788 binding was increased 3.6 and 1.6 fold respectively, compared to the absence of GABA, while ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE) and clebopride were less potent in the presence of GABA. 5. Diazepam was 30 fold less potent at displacing [3H]-Ro 15-1788 in membranes that had been photoaffinity labelled with FNM than in control membranes, whereas the potency of beta CCE did not differ. Clebopride and Delagrange 2674 showed a less than two fold loss of potency in photoaffinity labelled membranes. 6. The pattern of binding of clebopride and Delagrange 2674 in these in vitro tests is similar to that found previously with partial agonists or antagonists at BDZ binding sites. 7. Clebopride and Delagrange 2674 inhibited [3H]-FNM binding with similar potency in rat cerebellar and hippocampal membranes, suggesting they have no selectivity for BDZ1 and BDZ2 binding sites. 8. Clebopride and Delagrange 2674 are structurally dissimilar to other BDZ ligands and represent another chemical structure to probe brain BDZ binding sites.", 
    "23": "The potential anti-Parkinson drugs 1-R-4,4-diphenylpiperidines and 1-R-4,4-diphenyl-4-sila-piperidines (R = H, CH3, i-propyl and t-butyl) were evaluated for their neuroreceptor affinity with respect to their structure-activity relationship. In these compounds substitution of the central carbon at position 4 by a silicon leads to more lipophilic substances. While the binding of these compounds to dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptors is relatively non-specific, the binding to the mu- and delta-subtypes of opiate receptors and to the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine receptor binding site show probably pharmacologically relevant effects. In almost all cases the sila-compounds have a slightly higher receptor affinity than the corresponding carbon-compounds. The studies on the uptake sites for the biogenic amines noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin, on the other hand, reveal some considerable differences between the carbon- and silicon-containing analogues. The 4,4-diphenyl-4-sila-piperidine has much stronger uptake inhibiting properties for noradrenaline and serotonin than the corresponding carbon compound.", 
    "24": "Age-related differences in GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors were investigated in cerebella of young (1-month-old), mature adult (3 months old), older (8 months old) and aged (20 months old) mice. In cerebellar membranes of aged mice, [3H]muscimol binding was significantly higher as compared to those from all three younger age groups. Binding was the same in these younger age groups. Scatchard analysis of binding isotherms in cerebellum of young and aged mice showed the presence of two components (with different affinities and binding capacities). In aged mice, a significantly lower KD of low affinity sites and a significantly higher Bmax of high affinity sites were noted as compared to those in young mice. However, [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellar membranes was the same in both age groups. These results suggested that GABAA receptor binding was increased during senescence in cerebella without altering benzodiazepine binding.", 
    "25": "In normal Krebs solution, diazepam (1.75X10(-4) M) increased the action potential duration in a reversible form and caused a positive inotropic effect on mouse auricular muscle (4). 2.) Further studies on diazepam action on electrical and mechanical activity of left auricular muscle from mouse and guinea pig, in preparations electrically driven, showed that diazepam induces an increase in action potential duration measured at 20% repolarization, a decrease in the rate of spike depolarization, and modifies the conduction velocity of the action potential. 3.) Diazepam produced in preparation with spontaneous activity, positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, and positive inotropic effect in electrically driven preparations. 4.) The change in action potential duration induced by diazepam on mouse preparations was higher than on guinea pig preparations, ca.X3. 5.) These findings support that diazepam action may be due to an increase in the inward calcium current and a reduction in the inward sodium current.", 
    "26": "Neuronal transmitter stores of the rat phrenic nerve were labelled by an incubation with [3H]choline. Release of [3H]acetylcholine was elicited either by a short (100 pulses, 5 Hz) or by a long (1500 pulses, 5 or 25 Hz) period of electrical nerve stimulation. Pirenzepine and dicyclomine enhanced transmitter release evoked by the short stimulation period. Both antagonists reduced transmitter release evoked by the long stimulation period. Pirenzepine reduced transmitter release at low concentrations (1 nmol/l) whereas a higher concentration was necessary for the enhancing effect; the opposite pattern was found for dicyclomine. A low concentration of oxotremorine (10 nmol/l) enhanced and a high concentration (1 mumol/l) reduced transmitter release evoked by the short stimulation period. Both effects could be prevented by a low concentration of pirenzepine (10 nmol/l). It is concluded that facilitatory and inhibitory muscarine receptors are present on the motor nerve. A short stimulation period activates predominantly the negative muscarinic feedback, whereas during a long period of continuous nerve stimulation the positive muscarinic feedback mechanism is additionally activated. Both the facilitatory and inhibitory receptors might be regarded as M1-receptors but differences in the pharmacological properties between both receptor populations appear possible.", 
    "27": "Harmine (HA) induces a jumping behavior in rats when the central dopaminergic function has been activated. Possible involvement of the GABAergic systems and the benzodiazepine receptors (BZA-R) in the jumping behavior induced by HA and apomorphine (APO) was investigated. Pretreatment with GABAergic agonists, muscimol (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.2-1.0 mg/kg), and antagonists, picrotoxin (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) and bicuculline (0.1-0.5 mg/kg), suppressed the jumping behavior in a dose-dependent manner in rats treated with HA (10 mg/kg) and APO (2 mg/kg). After treatment with 2, 5 or 10 mg/kg of HA in combination with 2 mg/kg of APO, a decrease in 3H-diazepam binding to the brain regional membranes was observed in the corpus striatum (CS) in a dose-dependent manner, but not in the other brain regions. The decrease in the 3H-diazepam binding to the CS membranes was proportional to the increase in the HA levels in the CS, and the HA levels were correlated with the intensity of jumping behavior. Pretreatment with Ro 15-1788, an antagonist of BZA-R, suppressed the jumping behavior induced by HA and APO. These results indicated the involvement of the GABAergic systems in the jumping behavior and suggested that HA induced the jumping behavior partly as a result of interacting with the BZA-R.", 
    "28": "gamma-Aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors on chick ciliary ganglion neurons can be modulated by benzodiazepines and identified by radiolabeled benzodiazepine binding. Enhancement of submaximal GABA responses by benzodiazepines was demonstrated using a multibarrel pipette to construct complete benzodiazepine dose-response curves for single cells in culture. EC50 values of 22 +/- 5 nM, 1.1 +/- 0.3 microM, and 4.6 +/- 0.5 microM were obtained for flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and chlordiazepoxide, respectively. Chlordiazepoxide shifted the GABA dose-response curve to lower GABA concentrations without increasing the maximal response to GABA, demonstrating that benzodiazepines enhance the GABA response by increasing the receptor affinity for GABA. The imidazodiazepine Ro15-1788 potentiated the GABA response with an EC50 of 250 +/- 70 nM, and Ro5-4864 (chlorodiazepam) partially blocked the GABA response both in the presence and absence of chlordiazepoxide. Scatchard analysis of data from binding studies with [3H]flunitrazepam to ganglion membrane homogenates was consistent with the presence of a single class of high affinity sites with a KD of 34 +/- 6 nM and a Bmax of 145 +/- 26 fmol/mg of protein. Several lines of evidence indicated that the sites were associated with GABAA receptors. The KD of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was similar to the EC50 for flunitrazepam modulation of the GABA response. The level of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was enhanced approximately 50% over control levels by GABA. The binding was decreased both by clonazepam and by Ro5-4864 at concentrations similar to those required for the compounds to modulate the GABA response. These studies demonstrate that ciliary ganglion GABAA receptors are similar in major respects to GABAA receptors in the central nervous system but may differ in minor pharmacological properties.", 
    "29": "beta-Carbolines are competitive ligands of central type benzodiazepine receptors and have been reported to display either agonist, inverse agonist, or antagonist activities in vivo. We studied the in vivo inhibition of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in mice by various beta-carbolines of different pharmacological profiles and found that they were all more potent in the cerebellum than in the cortex and hippocampus; their ID50 values (dose inhibiting 50% of the specific binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788) were 3 to 7 times lower in the cerebellum than in the hippocampus. The ID50 of the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872 was 2.3 times lower in the cerebellum than in the hippocampus. Thus, regional differences do not seem to explain pharmacological profile. Correlation of receptor occupancy with pharmacological effects showed that high receptor occupancy (40%) was needed to obtain the convulsant effects of the inverse agonist methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate whereas intermediate receptor occupancy (30%) led to the proconflict effects and very low receptor occupancy (less than 5%) to the facilitating effects in learning and memory tasks. We also found that the selective antagonist of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines 3-(methoxycarbonyl)-amino-beta-carboline, even at high doses (20 mg/kg), did not occupy more than 70% of the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "30": "The modulation of insulin output from isolated perifused rat islets by the intestinal peptides cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) was assessed. In the presence of 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) glucose, but not 2.75 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) glucose, CCK (5 nmol/L) or GIP (50 ng/mL) alone evoke small insulin secretory responses. However, the combination of GIP (50 ng/mL) plus CCK (5 nmol/L) together with 7 mmol/L glucose results in a markedly amplified insulin secretory response. CCK (50 nmol/L) alone increases phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in islets, an event reflected by an increase in 3H efflux from myo[2-3H]inositol prelabeled islets and parallel accumulations of labeled inositol phosphates. GIP (50 ng/mL) alone has no effect on PI hydrolysis. However, GIP reduces the quantitative impact of CCK on PI turnover, an effect attributable to the capacity of GIP to elevate islet cAMP levels. CCK has no significant effect on islet cAMP levels. The results support the concept that the synergistic action of these peptides on insulin output is mediated by their ability to generate separate beta cell second messenger molecules. Nutrient-regulated intestinal release of various peptides represents a remarkable control system to ensure the release of insulin from the beta cell in amounts commensurate with both the quantity and quality of nutrient intake.", 
    "31": "Further in vitro studies of steroids active at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor regulated Cl- channel labeled by [35S]-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) reveal additional structural requirements necessary for activity. Evaluation of selected steroids for activity against TBPS-induced convulsions show similar requirements for activity. Interestingly, steroids (e.g., 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha, 20 alpha-diol) were identified that have high potency but limited efficacy as modulators of [35S]TBPS binding. These characteristics are reminiscent of the clinically useful benzodiazepines (BZs) such as clonazepam. However, interactions between the prototypical anesthetic-barbiturate, sodium pentobarbital, and steroids active at the Cl- channel suggest that they do not share a common site of action as allosteric modulators of [35S]TBPS and BZ receptor binding. The most potent steroid evaluated, 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one, modulates [35S]TBPS binding at low concentrations (IC50 approximately 17 nM) in a regionally dependent manner. All [35S]TBPS binding sites appear to be functionally coupled to a steroid \"modulatory site.\" Because several of the active steroids are metabolites of progesterone, their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]promegestrone to the cytosolic progestin receptor in rat uterus was evaluated. Those steroids showing potent activity at the GABAA receptor-Cl- ionophore were inactive at the intracellular progestin receptor. Such specificity coupled with their high potency provide additional support for the hypothesis that some of these steroids may be involved in the homeostatic regulation of brain excitability via the GABAA-BZ receptor complex.", 
    "32": "In this report, muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis is characterized pharmacologically in the rat retina. In the presence of eserine, acetylcholine (ACh) elicited a concentration-dependent increase in inositol monophosphate with a calculated EC50 of about 2.8 microM. Maximum increase was achieved with about 100 microM ACh. Cholinergic receptor agonists stimulated phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PI with the following rank order of potency: ACh = oxotremorine greater than McN-A-343 greater than bethanechol greater than arecoline = carbachol greater than muscarine. Oxotremorine analogs stimulated PI hydrolysis with the following rank order of potency: ACh = oxotremorine = oxotremorine-2 greater than oxotremorine-M = oxotremorine-4. Carbachol-mediated Pl hydrolysis was blocked by atropine and by the putatively selective muscarinic type 1 (M1) receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, with apparent Ki values of 0.1 and 1.0 nM, respectively. In contrast, the selective muscarinic type 2 (M2) antagonists, gallamine and AF-DX 116, failed to inhibit the action of carbachol. These findings demonstrate that stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the rat retina leads to PI hydrolysis and that these receptors appear to be M1 cholinergic receptors.", 
    "33": "In rat kidney high-affinity binding sites for [3H]Ro-5-4864 and [3H]PK-11195 with the properties of the peripheral-type acceptor were found enriched in mitochondrial (M) and light-mitochondrial-lysosomal (L) fractions on differential centrifugation. When the combined M and L fractions were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, these binding sites were found enriched at a density of 1.155 g/ml coincident with a population of light mitochondria, whereas a population of heavier mitochondria (rho = 1.175 g/ml) had few or no binding sites. Transmission electron microscopy showed that whereas the heavier mitochondria appeared highly pure and intact, the lighter mitochondria appeared less intact and to be contaminated with vesicular structures. After fractionation of the light mitochondria and vesicles by centrifugation, both fractions showed the same ratio of [3H]Ro-4864 binding sites to monoamine oxidase activity consistent with the vesicles being of mitochondrial outer-membrane origin. Digitonin pre-treatment had no effect on the density of acceptor-rich fractions on sucrose density gradient centrifugation. However, pretreatment with succinate/iodophenylnitrophenylphenyltetrazolium (INT) perturbed equally the density of acceptor-rich fractions and mitochondrial marker enzymes. When mitochondrial fractions were subjected to sonication prior to density gradient centrifugation the binding sites were now found highly enriched in a much lighter fraction coincident with the monoamine oxidase activity and thus consistent with being outer-membrane vesicles. When a mitochondrial fraction was subjected to hypotonic treatment before assay no evidence for activation/unmasking of binding sites was found. The hypotonic treatment did not release any inhibitor of the binding sites. These results are consistent with the peripheral benzodiazepine acceptor having an outer-membrane location on a sub-population of rat kidney mitochondria. Those mitochondria showing high levels of the acceptor are either light mitochondria or appear more susceptible to osmotic damage than those mitochondria in which the acceptor is absent or at low levels.", 
    "34": "A rat C6 glioma tumor model has demonstrated that C6 tumor cells express a high density of peripheral benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors. We report a poor correlation between the density of peripheral BDZ receptors and tumor metabolism using [14C]-deoxyglucose in this C6 glioma model. We also compared the abilities of in vivo and in vitro BDZ receptor binding and tumor metabolism to measure the tumor area. All imaging methods were capable of estimating both the gross and total tumor area and had similar specificities and sensitivities. Because of a high signal-to-noise ratio, in vivo peripheral BDZ receptor binding may be a useful method for determining tumor size in human tumors expressing the receptor using PET.", 
    "35": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) results in increased renal resistance as well as in exaggerated prostaglandin (PG) release from the obstructed hydronephrotic kidney (HNK). We have reported previously that platelet-activating factor (PAF) dose-dependently stimulates the release of PGs from both the HNK and unobstructed contralateral kidney (CLK), with CLK release being 10% that of the HNK. In the present report, we studied the interaction of PAF with its receptor by examining the effects of PAF-receptor antagonists on the release of PGs from the isolated perfused rabbit HNK and CLK stimulated by PAF; angiotensin II (AII), and bradykinin (BK) were also used as agonists. In the HNK, kadsurenone (3 microM) inhibited PAF-stimulated PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) release by 28.2 and 62.5% respectively. CV-3988 (20 microM) and triazolam (5 microM) also preferentially diminished PAF-stimulated TxB2 release. In addition, all three drugs significantly diminished BK- and AII-stimulated TxB2 release, while CV-3988 was the only antagonist to affect peptide-stimulated PGE2 release. While effective against agonist-stimulated PG synthesis, these drugs had no direct effect on arachidonic acid metabolism to PGs. Furthermore, in the CLK, CV-3988 had no effect on BK- or AII-stimulated PGE2 release, whereas it totally inhibited PAF-stimulated release of PGE2. These results show that PAF-receptor antagonists in the HNK preferentially inhibit TxB2 release whether stimulated by PAF, AII or BK; in the CLK only PAF-stimulated PG release is affected. This biochemical difference may be of physiological significance and explain some of the functional differences between the HNK and CLK. Therefore, PAF may be an important mediator of some of the biochemical and functional changes associated with UUO.", 
    "36": "A pronounced left/right asymmetry of GABA-gated chloride channels was observed in rat cerebral cortex. This asymmetry was manifest as a higher apparent affinity and density of binding sites for the \"cage\" convulsant [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) in the right compared to left cortex. Asymmetries in [35S]TBPS binding were not observed in other brain areas, and were restricted to the occipital and entorhinal/pyriform areas of cerebral cortex. Evaluation of other components of the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex in cerebral cortex suggests that this asymmetry is not present in either benzodiazepine receptors or that population of GABA receptors linked to benzodiazepine receptors. Brief restraint-stress significantly increased both the apparent affinity and number of [35S]TBPS binding sites in cortex, but the left/right asymmetry was no longer apparent. These findings indicate a time-dependent, asymmetric response of cortical GABA-gated chloride channels to stress rather than an anatomical hemispheric difference, and suggest that GABA-gated chloride channels may be involved in a differential processing of stressful stimuli by the cerebral hemispheres.", 
    "37": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptors were purified from the brains of 5 to 10-day-old rats and photolabeled by [3H]flunitrazepam. After sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), 3 different proteins with apparent molecular weight 51,000, 53,000 and 59,000 Da specifically and irreversibly labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam were revealed by autoradiography. The same 3 proteins were recognized by the alpha-subunit-specific monoclonal antibody bd-28. In contrast, a different protein with apparent molecular weight 56,000 Da was recognized by the beta-subunit-specific antibody bd-17. These results indicate that the various proteins specifically labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam are different alpha-subunits and distinct and different from the beta-subunit of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "38": "The interaction of ethanol with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated 36-Cl-influx and its modulation by various drugs was investigated in C57 mice spinal cord cultured neurons. Ethanol (5-100 mM) potentiated the effect of GABA on 36Cl-influx; whereas at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 mM ethanol activated Cl- channels directly. The effect of ethanol was specific for GABAA receptor-gated Cl- channels, as ethanol did not potentiate glycine-induced 36Cl-influx in the same neurons. Both the enhancing and direct effects of ethanol on 36Cl-influx were blocked by GABA antagonists like bicuculline, picrotoxinin and inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine site like the imidazodiazepine R015-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5 alpha], [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142). Ethanol potentiating effect of GABA-induced 36Cl-influx was also reversed by methyl-6,7-dimethyl-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. The effects of the inverse agonists were blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist R015-1788. Both R015-4513 and FG-7142 reversed direct and GABA potentiating effects of ethanol effect at concentrations lower than those that exhibit inverse agonistic activity in the 36Cl-influx assay in cultured neurons. These results suggest that ethanol facilitation of GABAAergic transmission involves GABA receptor-gated Cl- channels and that this interaction may be responsible for some of the pharmacological effects of ethanol.", 
    "39": "Significant differences in the thermal stability of benzodiazepine receptors were found in cerebral cortical membranes prepared from the long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) selected mouse lines. Thus, benzodiazepine receptors from LS mice were heat inactivated (55 degrees C) at a significantly faster rate than those from SS mice. Although gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reduced the rate of heat inactivation in both lines, the more rapid rate of inactivation in the LS line was maintained. Furthermore, the potency of GABA to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding decreased threefold in membranes from LS mice as the incubation temperature was increased from 0 degrees to 37 degrees C, but was unaltered in membranes from SS mice. These differences in the biophysical properties of the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor chloride channel complex (\"supramolecular complex\"), together with a higher KD for t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate in membranes from LS compared to SS mice, suggest that the supramolecular complex may modulate the differential sensitivity to some depressants and convulsants in these lines.", 
    "40": "Of 22 patients investigated for sleep disorders, habitual snoring and/or daytime hypersomnolence, 12(10 men) had obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). 3 OSAS were mild, 5 moderate and 4 severe. The leading symptoms were daytime hypersomnolence and habitual snoring. As risk factors we found retro-micrognathia in 2 patients, macroglossia secondary to acromegaly in 1, alcohol abuse in 7 and obesity in 6. Conservative measures improved the disorder subjectively in 6 patients. One patient had a relapse 6 months after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. 4 patients were successfully treated by nasal CPAP. Other diagnoses were idiopathic alveolar hypoventilation (2), Cheyne-Stokes breathing secondary to low cardiac output (1), monosymptomatic narcolepsy (2), sleep disturbances secondary to depression (2), chronic benzodiazepine abuse (1) and chronic bronchitis without nocturnal hypoxemia (1). History, clinical observation and oxymetry make diagnosis possible in most cases of OSAS severe enough to require treatment. Polysomnography is time-consuming and should be reserved for selected cases.", 
    "41": "210 psychiatric outpatients with generalised anxiety disorder (71), or panic disorder (74), or dysthymic disorder (65) diagnosed by an interview schedule for DSM-III were allocated by constrained randomisation to one of five treatments: diazepam (28), dothiepin (28), placebo (28), cognitive and behaviour therapy (84), and a self-help treatment programme (42). All treatments were given for 6 weeks and then withdrawn by 10 weeks. Ratings of psychopathology were made by psychiatric assessors blind to both treatment and diagnosis before treatment and at 2, 4, 6, and 10 weeks after randomisation. 18 patients had insufficient data for analysis because of early drop-out. There were no important differences in treatment response between the diagnostic groups, but diazepam was less effective than dothiepin, cognitive and behaviour therapy, or self-help, these three treatments being of similar efficacy. Significantly more patients in the placebo group took additional psychotropic drugs in the 10 week period, and those allocated to dothiepin and cognitive and behaviour therapy took the least.", 
    "42": "The novel CCK antagonist L364,718 was tested on caerulein- and morphine-induced antinociception in rat using the paw pressure test. Caerulein-induced antinociception (ED50 = 30 micrograms/kg) was significantly inhibited by L354,718 (200 micrograms/kg i.p.) which on its own did not affect paw pressure threshold. In contrast, morphine-induced antinociception was significantly potentiated by L364,718. Since L364,718 is highly selective for 'peripheral' receptors which are found in tissue such as pancreas and gallbladder and a few discrete areas of brain, this receptor is likely to be implicated in the antinociceptive effect of caerulein.", 
    "43": "3-(2-Carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), a novel antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor, was evaluated in four rodent models of epilepsy, i.e. maximal electroshock seizures and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice, epileptic gerbils and amygdala-kindled rats. The effect of CPP after systemic (i.p.) injection was compared with that of the clinical antiepileptics, phenobarbital and diazepam, and in gerbils, in addition, with the effect of the NMDA antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5) and 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (AP7). CPP, 5 mg/kg i.p., increased the threshold for tonic electroshock seizures but this effect was associated with motor impairment in the chimney test whereas phenobarbital had comparable anticonvulsant potency without motor impairment. The threshold for clonic PTZ seizures was increased by CPP only at high doses (20 mg/kg) which induced ataxia and marked motor impairment in the chimney test, whereas both diazepam and phenobarbital were active in this test at doses which exerted no side-effects. CPP, 2-20 mg/kg i.p., could not reduce the severity or duration of focal and generalized clonic seizures or the duration of amygdalar afterdischarges in the amygdala-kindling model in rats but instead caused ataxia and reduced muscle tone at the higher doses examined. Diazepam and phenobarbital both had anticonvulsant efficacy in this model. CPP at doses of 5-10 mg/kg did not reduce seizure severity in gerbils in which generalized tonic-clonic seizures were induced by air-blast stimulation, but, as in mice and rats, it caused motor impairment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "A nanomolar affinity peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site is described in human erythrocyte membranes. [3H]PK 11195 is displaced from this binding site by unlabeled drugs with the rank order PK 11195 greater than Ro 5-4864 greater than flunitrazepam much greater than clonazepam. Neither GABA nor a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP have an effect on binding parameters. These data provide evidence that a peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, pharmacologically similar to the intracellular binding site described in other tissues, is present in the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes.", 
    "45": "Twenty-two-hour water-deprived rats were trained with a choice between a sodium saccharin solution (0.01% or 0.05%) and water in a 30-min drinking test. The potent benzodiazepine agonist, clonazepam, produced highly significant dose-related (0.1-1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) increases in total fluid consumption. The most important finding was that clonazepam selectively enhanced ingestion of the preferred 0.05% solution, while producing no change in the consumption of water. It did not selectively affect ingestion of the marginally preferred 0.01% solution. These data can be linked to recent evidence that benzodiazepines facilitate positive ingestive reactions elicited by palatable tastes. Together, the evidence indicates that benzodiazepines can selectively affect consumption of preferred solutions through enhancement of positive reactions to palatable tastes. In contrast to the results with clonazepam, the novel compound zolpidem, which binds preferentially to cerebellar-type benzodiazepine sites, failed to affect fluid intake or sweet taste preference. This suggests that hippocampal-type, as distinct from cerebellar-type receptors, may be necessary in the mediation of effects of benzodiazepines on taste-palatability processing and ingestion.", 
    "46": "A molecular rearrangement of benzophenones (hydrolysis products of 1,4-benzodiazepines) to 9-acridones has been studied. The compounds synthesized were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector, because of their high luminescence. The method, which can detect sixteen benzodiazepines simultaneously, is highly sensitive and adequately specific. It is reliable for the analysis of these compounds in biological samples at therapeutic concentrations.", 
    "47": "This study investigated blood pressure in guinea pigs while they were 1) alert and free moving, 2) anesthetized with different anesthetics, and 3) exposed to continuous, 115 dB SPL white noise under anesthesia. The animals were prepared with a carotid artery catheter and permitted to recover for 48 h before blood pressure levels were measured. Mean arterial blood pressure in the resting, unrestrained guinea pig was 64 mmHg (+/- 1.38 S.E.). Ketamine Hydrochloride (Ketamine) significantly decreased, and Fentanyl-Citrate significantly increased, blood pressure. Fentanyl-Droperidol produced no substantial blood pressure change. Guinea pigs anesthetized with Fentanyl-Citrate and Fentanyl-Droperidol demonstrated significant blood pressure increases when exposed to noise, with the Fentanyl-Citrate group showing a greater response. Animals anesthetized with Ketamine Hydrochloride exhibited no significant blood pressure changes when exposed to the noise.", 
    "48": "The symptoms and clinical management of alcohol, barbiturate and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes are discussed in this article. People who suffer alcohol withdrawal should be admitted to hospital if they have medical or surgical complications or severe symptoms; supportive care and pharmacotherapy, especially diazepam loading, are the essential components of treatment. Barbiturate withdrawal requires pharmacotherapy and admission to hospital for patients who have taken more than 0.4 g/d of secobarbital or an equivalent amount of another barbiturate for 90 days or longer, or 0.6 g/d or an equivalent dose for 30 days or longer, or who have had withdrawal seizures or delirium; phenobarbital loading is recommended. Regular benzodiazepine therapy that has lasted at least 3 months should be gradually stopped. Short-acting agents should be replaced with long-acting ones, such as diazepam, to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Most of these patients can be managed on an outpatient basis.", 
    "49": "The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor of the Xenopus oocyte was characterized electrophysiologically. Iontophoretic responses to acetylcholine were inhibited by the muscarinic antagonists 4-DAMP, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 at respective IC50 values of 7 nM, 15 microM and 2 microM. This antagonist sensitivity order indicates that the receptor is of the M3 muscarinic subtype.", 
    "50": "The effects of acute ethanol exposure of chick spinal cord neurons were studied in tissue culture, using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. Results indicate that ethanol produces a persistent increase in the sensitivity of spinal neurons to GABA and glycine, with no change in input resistance or resting membrane potential. Glutamate responses, in contrast, are unaffected by ethanol.", 
    "51": "Intrathecal (i.t.) injections of substance P (SP) and kainic acid in rats produced rostrally directed scratches with the hindlimbs and caudally directed bites or licks. These behaviors, together with myoclonic twitches and vocalization, were also produced by I.T. morphine and strychnine. Intrathecal valproic acid (VA) significantly reduced all behaviors when these occurred spontaneously, and VA and chlordiazepoxide both reduced these behaviors when they were evoked by a light cotton swab tap to the lumbosacral region, in rats treated with the excitatory compounds. Since neither anticonvulsant affected the thermal or mechanical pain threshold at these doses, these results suggest that (a) the behaviors elicited by i.t. injection of the excitatory compounds are not responses to perceived pain, but rather the expression of a spinal convulsive-like state, and (b), since scratching and biting were the only behaviors produced by SP, this peptide is neither necessary nor sufficient for the elicitation of pain at the spinal level. Although our experiments do not rule out other roles for SP in pain processes such as that of a neuromodulator, it is unlikely that this compound is a traditional primary afferent neurotransmitter of pain.", 
    "52": "PC12 pheochromocytoma cells show increased binding of the peripheral type benzodiazepine Ro 5-4864 after treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) in membrane preparations. Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, acts synergistically with NGF to produce further increases in binding, but by itself produces no effect. The increased binding appears to reflect increases in receptor number, since Kd remains unchanged. Binding shows a trend toward increase by day 6 after NGF treatment, and the increase is significant at days 9 and 12. The physiological roles of benzodiazepine binding sites on PC12 cells are unclear. Treatment of the cells with Ro 5-4864 produces no changes in basal or stimulated release of catecholamines, in activity of adenylate cyclase, or in cell proliferation.", 
    "53": "The anti-anxiety effect of diazepam and the antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors, ICS 205-930, was studied with a conditioned place aversion test design. The results showed that when one of two distinctive and previously preferred compartments was associated with an inescapable footshock, the control animals avoided that compartment in the post-conditioning test. Both diazepam (1-4 mg/kg i.p.) and ICS 205-930 (0.125-1.0 mg/kg i.p.), given before the post-conditioning test, increased in a dose-dependent manner the amount of time spent by the animals in the compartment conditioned to footshock. The results support the view that central 5-HT3 receptors may be involved in the control of anxiety.", 
    "54": "Sodium valproate (400 mg/kg) significantly reduced exploratory head-dipping in mice, without significant reductions in locomotor activity or rearing. After 5 daily injections of sodium valproate (50 or 400 mg/kg) there was tolerance to the effects of a test dose of 400 mg/kg. Pretreatment for 5 days with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) did not change the effects of sodium valproate (400 mg/kg), but 5 days pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide (20 mg/kg) did produce cross-tolerance. Sodium valproate (50 mg/kg) was without significant effect acutely, or after 5 days of pretreatment with sodium valproate (50 or 400 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 or 20 mg/kg). Daily injections of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (10 mg/kg), immediately after the daily injection of sodium valproate (400 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (20 mg/kg) did not prevent the development of tolerance or cross-tolerance. This suggests that benzodiazepine receptors may not mediate these phenomena; possible roles of GABA and 5-HT are also discussed.", 
    "55": "The effects of four benzodiazepines (diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam and clobazam) were studied on the head-twitch response induced in mice by several 5-HT receptor agonists. All the benzodiazepines tested potentiated the effects of the directly acting agonists 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT), quipazine and mescaline, without themselves inducing head-twitches. In contrast, none of them potentiated head-twitches induced by the indirectly acting agonist 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP; with carbidopa 25 mg/kg), and in some experiments a clear inhibition was seen. The clonazepam (10 mg/kg) potentiation of 5-MeODMT-induced head-twitches was not antagonised by flumazenil, (+)-bicuculline, or by pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine. Neither was it mimicked by muscimol, which inhibited head-twitches. These results indicate that the observed potentiation is not mediated by benzodiazepine receptors and that it occurs postsynaptically to the initiating 5-HT receptors. The inability of the benzodiapines to potentiate 5-HTP-induced head-twitches probably reflects a reduction in 5-HT neuronal activity mediated by benzodiazepine receptors, as co-administration of flumazenil and clonazepam potentiated the effects of 5-HTP whereas each compound alone had no effect.", 
    "56": "Postsynaptic potentials elicited by various muscarinic agonists and by preganglionic stimuli in the presence of such agonists were recorded from rabbit superior cervical ganglia using sucrose-gap and air-gap methods. While methacholine and bethanechol (both at 10(-4) M) induced biphasic potential changes, McN-A-343 and a novel synthetic compound AF-102B (10(-7) M-10(-5) M) produced only a depolarizing response which was depressed by the M1-antagonist pirenzepine (10(-7) M), but not by the M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 (same concentration), indicating that these compounds act purely as M1-muscarinic agonists in this system. These agonists selectively depressed the orthodromic slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in a dose-dependent manner without substantially affecting the fast EPSP; this is in accord with the view that their depolarizing action is on the same postsynaptic muscarinic receptor that mediates the slow EPSP. The slow inhibitory post synaptic potential (IPSP), on the other hand, was found potentiated in the presence of these agonists. This potentiation was antagonized not only by pirenzepine but also by yohimbine; the potentiation was itself enlarged by nomifensine (a dopamine-uptake inhibitor). We postulate that M1-muscarinic receptors are present not only on the postganglionic principal cells but also on the interneurons; the former were already known to be responsible for the generation of slow EPSP, but the latter may be on terminals of dopamine-containing small intensely fluorescent cells and regulate the orthodromic release of dopamine and are to be distinguished from the M2-receptors.", 
    "57": "An elevated plus-maze, used to identify anxiolytic effects of drugs (Pellow et al., 1985), reflected as increased open-arm exploration, was employed in cycling and ovariectomised rats, to determine the effect of diazepam on the cycle and, after ovariectomy, to investigate possible influences of treatment with oestradiol (10 or 100 micrograms/kg, s.c.) (acute: 1 day or subchronic: 3 days) to ovariectomised rats on the effect of diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.), studied 3, 24 and 72 hr after cessation of treatment. Cycling females, exhibiting 3 consecutive 4-day oestrous cycles and ovariectomised rats, 15 days after surgery, were used. There was a tendency for increased open-arm exploration by rats in proestrous and diestrous, as compared to the other phases of the cycle and to ovariectomised rats. Rats treated 24 hr after subchronic treatment with oestradiol also exhibited increased open-arm exploration. The anti-anxiety effect of diazepam was clearly shown in oestrous and metestrous but not in proestrous, diestrous or in ovariectomised rats. The effect of diazepam was abolished in rats tested 3 hr after acute small doses of estradiol and attenuated in rats tested 24 hr after subchronic administration of the hormone. The results suggest that oestradiol, administered in physiological doses, may have an inhibitory effect on the diazepam-induced anxiolysis.", 
    "58": "This study investigated central anticholinergic drug effects on: (1) the Randt Memory Test, a relatively new instrument which measures the acquisition and recall of verbal and pictorial information; (2) the averaged photopalpebral reflex (PPR), an electrophysiological parameter, the validity of which needs to be further investigated in pharmacological research and; (3) mood as measured by a 16-item visual analogue scale. Atropine (1 mg and 2 mg), pirenzepine (20 mg) and a placebo were administered intramuscularly in a double-blind cross-over trial in eight healthy volunteers. There were no inter-treatment differences on the Randt Memory Test. This finding is seemingly in contrast to those reported by some authors using other memory tests. In contrast to the reported effects of some benzodiazepines, the anticholinergics used in the present study did not prolong the latencies of the PPR, but reduced the amplitudes. Visual analogue scales indicated central effects for both pirenzepine and atropine. This implies pirenzepine's penetration of the blood-brain barrier and a physiological function for central muscarinic-1-receptors. The significant anticholinergic effects were exclusive to the \"alertness\" factor.", 
    "59": "The antiemetic efficacy of high-dose metoclopramide (MCP), diphenhydramine (DPH), methylprednisolone (MPL), and diazepam (DZP) was investigated in 40 gynecologic cancer patients for a total of 98 chemotherapy courses, treated with cisplatin (50 mg/m2). With MPL (500 mg i.v. x 2) plus DZP (5 mg i.m. x 2), no vomiting occurred in 0% and mild emesis (vomiting 1-2 times) occurred in 20% of 25 courses. With MCP (2 mg/kg i.v. x 5) plus DPH (40 mg i.v. x 3), no vomiting occurred in 35% and mild emesis occurred in 10% of 20 courses. With a combination of MCP plus DPH and MPL plus DZP, no vomiting occurred in 51% and mild emesis occurred in 25% of 53 courses. These results indicate that high-dose MCP plus DPH are effective in preventing cisplatin-induced vomiting. Furthermore, the antiemetic efficacy of MCP plus DPH (0-2 vomiting episodes: 45%) was significantly enhanced (p less than 0.05) by the combined use of MPL plus DZP (0-2 vomiting episodes: 76%).", 
    "60": "Feeding of 14C-labeled amino acids to resting cells of Aspergillus alliaceus strongly supported the intuitive hypothesis that asperlicin is biosynthesized from tryptophan, anthranilate and leucine. The resting cell system was used also to prepare 25 asperlicin analogs via directed biosynthesis in presence of analogs of tryptophan and leucine.", 
    "61": "Asperlicins B (1, C31H29N5O5), C (2, C25H18N4O2), D (3, C25H18N4O2), and E (4, C25H18N4O3) are novel cholecystokinin antagonists produced by Aspergillus alliaceus. The structures of these compounds have been determined by 1H NMR and MS analysis.", 
    "62": "The discovery and biological properties of four novel cholecystokinin antagonists produced by Aspergillus alliaceus is described. One of these was seven times more potent than the previously reported asperlicin.", 
    "63": "Three adult male baboons were trained on a psychophysical procedure to discriminate five synthetic, steady-state vowel sounds [a), (ae), (c), (U), and (epsilon] from one another. A pulsed train of one vowel comprised the reference stimulus during a session. Animals were trained to press a lever and release the lever only when this reference vowel sound changed to one of the comparison vowels. All animals learned the vowel discriminations rapidly and, once learned, performed the discriminations at the 95%-100% correct level. During the initial acquisition of the discriminations, however, percent correct detections were higher for those vowels with greater spectral differences from the reference vowel. For some cases, the detection scores correlated closely with differences between first formant peaks, while for others the detection scores correlated more closely with differences between second formant peaks. Once the discriminations were acquired, no discriminability differences were apparent among the different vowels. Underlying discriminability differences were still present, however, and could be revealed by giving a minor tranquilizer (diazepam) that lowered discrimination performances. These drug-induced decrements in vowel discriminability were also correlated with spectral differences, with lower vowel discriminability scores found for those vowels with smaller spectral differences from the reference vowel.", 
    "64": "Most children vomit after strabismus surgery. Administration of intravenous droperidol to unpremedicated paediatric patients following induction but prior to eye manipulation markedly reduces the incidence of postoperative emesis. This study tested the hypothesis that even earlier administration of droperidol, orally as a component of an oral premedication, would further reduce the incidence of postoperative emesis in this group of patients. Sixty-five patients were randomized into three premedication groups. One group received the standard oral premedication used for all outpatients at our institution (meperidine 1.5 mg.kg-1, diazepam 0.15 mg.kg-1, atropine 0.02 mg.kg-1). In the other two groups, droperidol in a dose of 50 or 75 micrograms.kg-1 was substituted for the diazepam. Droperidol-treated groups demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of vomiting prior to hospital discharge compared to the groups that received the standard oral premedication (standard--73 per cent, 50 micrograms.kg-1 droperidol--33 per cent, 75 micrograms.kg-1 droperidol--36 per cent) without prolonging hospital stay.", 
    "65": "Electroencephalographic changes have been studied in a group of 32 men aged 30-65 (mean 49) with diagnosed chronic toxic encephalopathy. The group had been carefully scrutinised for other possible causes of brain dysfunction and the diagnosis was based on neuraesthenic symptoms and pathological psychometric performance. The EEGs were recorded from four areas of the brain and the power spectrum analysed. Comparisons have been made with a group of 50 healthy male workers with no occupational exposure to solvents. For 24 of the 32 patients a follow up EEG recording was made after 17-75 months (mean 33). The results showed a doubling of the EEG power in the patients for all four recording channels with a significant reduction at follow up but not to the level of the control group. No exposure effect relation could be established. Acute exposure at the time of the first recording, exposure free, or follow up time did not influence the results. The frequency of the dominant EEG activity and the relative frequency distribution were equal in the two groups and did not change during the follow up period. Five of the 32 subjects took benzodiazepine drugs regularly and they had greater total power in all four recording channels compared with the other 27 patients; the difference was not statistically significant. The relative frequency distribution showed less alpha- and more theta- and beta-power in these five subjects. A reduction in total power during follow up was also found in the subgroup that took benzodiazepines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Ten alprazolam-dependent patients were studied with clinical and biologic variables after equal doses of clonazepam were substituted for alprazolam. Withdrawal was accomplished over a seven-day period. Anxiety and plasma cortisol levels were measured and found not to be significantly different between the withdrawal period and the postwithdrawal medication-free period.", 
    "67": "Rats were trained to discriminate between saline and 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam in a two-choice procedure where responding was maintained under a fixed-ratio, 5-response schedule of stimulus shock termination. beta-Carboline-3-carboxylate-methyl ester (beta CCM), beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-ethyl ester (beta CCE) and beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta CCtB), compounds with alkylcarboxy substitutions on the 3-position of the beta-carboline ring structure, were effective antagonists of the discriminative effects of diazepam. The 3-hydroxymethyl-substituted compound (3HMC) was relatively ineffective in antagonizing the discriminative effects of diazepam. The order of potency in antagonizing the 1.0 mg/kg training dose of diazepam was beta CCtB greater than beta CCM greater than beta CCE much greater than 3 HMC. The greater potency of beta CCtB likely reflects its resistance to metabolism in vivo. beta CCE and beta CCtB produced dose-related, parallel shifts in the dose-response curve for the discriminative effects of diazepam, but the magnitude of the shifts was limited: the two highest doses of beta CCE and beta CCtB produced shifts that were not significantly different in magnitude. These latter results suggest that these beta-carbolines antagonize only a portion of the component(s) of action of diazepam in producing discriminative stimuli. In contrast, the 7-substituted beta-carbolines harmane, harmol and harmine were ineffective in antagonizing the discriminative effects of diazepam up to doses of the beta-carbolines which disrupted the ability of the animals to respond.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The effect of midazolam on alpha-activity of the EEG and latency of the P-100 of the visual evoked response (VER) was studied in six healthy subjects. Drug concentration was related to effect with the Emax model that was used with either a threshold drug concentration or a sigmoid exponent. An effect compartment was included in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Four subjects showed hysteresis, and mean values of half-lives-k(eo) ranged from 0.26 to 0.60 hour. Mean values of EC50 ranged from 42.0 to 48.1 ng/ml. Goodness of fit did not differ significantly between the sigmoid Emax model and the threshold Emax model. The sigmoid exponent estimated was 3.7 +/- 1.8 (EEG, mean +/- SD) and 2.9 +/- 1.4 (VER); the threshold concentration was estimated at 15.7 +/- 11.1 ng/ml (EEG) and 11.3 +/- 7.0 ng/ml (VER). We conclude that the Emax model adequately describes the relationship between midazolam concentration and effect and that the sigmoid exponent can be substituted by a threshold drug concentration, with a comparable fit of the model to the data.", 
    "69": "Nineteen cases of generalized status myoclonicus (GSM) associated with acute anoxic and/or toxic-metabolic encephalopathy were studied. Generalized status myoclonicus was associated with coma in the overwhelming majority of patients (95%), although one patient had only clouding of consciousness. Generalized status myoclonicus occurred in 13 patients after cardiorespiratory arrest and in six patients after toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Thirteen patients died, four survived in a chronic vegetative state, and two recovered without any permanent neurologic sequelae. Generalized status myoclonicus was preceded by generalized tonic-clonic seizures or generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus in six patients (32%). The implications of these findings are discussed and a hypothesis that generalized status myoclonicus is a fragment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus is proposed. Generalized status myoclonicus is a grave prognostic indicator that is often not compatible with useful recovery in spite of all therapeutic efforts. The final outcome is related to the underlying disease process. In our study, complete neurologic recovery was observed in two patients (11%).", 
    "70": "All of the optical isomers of the muscarinic antagonists 3-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octyl) alpha-hydroxy-alpha,alpha-diphenylacetate (3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, QNB, 1) 3-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octyl) xanthene-9-carboxylate (3-quinuclidinyl xanthene-9-carboxylate, QNX, 2), and 3-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]ocytl) alpha-hydroxy-alpha-phenylpropionate (3-quinuclidinyl atrolactate, QNA, 3) were prepared and studied in binding and functional assays. In all instances the esters of (R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (3-quinuclidinol) had greater affinity for the M1 and M2 subpopulations of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M-AChRs) than did their S counterparts. The enantiomers of QNB (1), QNX (2), and QNA (3) in which the alcoholic portion of the muscarinic antagonists had the S absolute stereochemistry were more selective for the M1-AChRs. This selectivity was modulated by the nature and, in the case of QNA, the chirality of the acid portion. The most potent isomer in the series was (R)-QNB. In the QNA series the diastereoisomer with the absolute R configuration of the alcohol (a) and the R configuration of the acid (b) was the most potent in both binding and functional assays whereas (Sa,Rb)-QNA was the most selective for the M1 subtype of M-AChRs. In fact, the latter diastereomer was as potent and selective as pirenzepine for M1-AChRs.", 
    "71": "A number of S-methylsulfonium analogues of the conformationally restricted muscarinic agonists of the 3-alk-oxy-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridine (O-alkyl-THPO) type have been synthesized. The effects on muscarinic receptors of these 3-alkoxy-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiopyrano[3,4-d]isoxazol-5 -ium (O-alkyl-S-methyl-DHTO) analogues (7a-d) were assessed in receptor-binding experiments with tritiated oxotremorine M, pirenzepine, and quinuclidinyl benzilate as ligands and were supported by studies on the isolated guinea pig ileum. The degree of muscarinic agonist activity of the compounds (M-agonist index) and their selectivity for M-1 or M-2 muscarinic receptor subtypes (M-2/M-1 index) were estimated on the basis of receptor-binding studies. The in vitro pharmacological profiles of the compounds were compared with those of arecoline and its sulfonium and 3-methoxyisoxazole isosteres, sulfoarecoline and O,5-dimethyl-THPO, respectively. While O-methyl-DHTO (5a) and N-methyl-DHTO (6a) were inactive, all of the sulfonium analogues 7a-d were muscarinic agonists with the exception of O-ethyl-S-methyl-DHTO (7b), which showed a muscarinic antagonist profile.", 
    "72": "Studies in dogs suggest that bombesin-stimulated pancreatic exocrine function is mediated via endogenous cholecystokinin. We studied (a) the short-term effects of bombesin on pancreatic juice volume and protein output in unconscious rats and (b) whether a potent cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist, L-364,718, affects the pancreatic exocrine response to bombesin. A 4-h i.v. infusion of low-dose (0.2 nmol/kg.h) or high-dose (1.0 nmol/kg.h) bombesin elicited significant increases in pancreatic juice volume and protein output, which were unaltered by treatment with L-364,718 at a dose capable of fully suppressing cholecystokinin-octapeptide-stimulated pancreatic juice volume and protein output. We conclude that the effects of exogenously administered bombesin on the exocrine pancreas in the rat are not mediated via release of endogenous cholecystokinin.", 
    "73": "Several pharmacological treatments, including application of an excitatory neurotoxin to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and systemic administration of triazolam, a clinically effective benzodiazepine, can elicit large phase shifts in a circadian rhythm according to the time of administration. The hypothesis that the LGN might mediate the effect of triazolam on circadian clock function was tested. Bilateral lesions of the LGN, which destroyed the connection from the intergeniculate leaflet to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, blocked phase-shift responses to triazolam. The requirement of an intact LGN for triazolam to shift circadian phase suggests that the LGN may be a site through which stimuli gain access to the circadian clock to modulate rhythm phase and entrainment.", 
    "74": "The sphincter smooth muscle of the iris is innervated by excitatory parasympathetic nerve fibers, and the activation of these fibers results in the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into its derived second messengers, myosin light chain phosphorylation and muscle contraction. The present study characterizes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) of the rabbit iris employing [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) and L-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) as probes. Binding studies indicated that [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB bound to homogeneous populations of mAChRs with apparent Bmax values of 0.67 and 1.09 pmol/mg protein respectively. Binding of radioligands was rapid, saturable, stereospecific, reversible, and inhibited by specific muscarinic agonists and antagonists in a competitive manner. [3H]NMS displayed a lower amount of nonspecific binding and a faster association and dissociation rate than [3H]QNB. The relative potencies for displacement of both radioligands, based on their Ki values, were (-)QNB greater than atropine greater than (+)QNB greater than pirenzepine greater than pilocarpine. Antagonist displacement of the radioligands appeared to obey the law of mass action, indicating interaction with a single binding site. However, displacement of the radioligands by the agonists carbamylcholine and methacholine indicated interaction with both high and low affinity binding sites. Comparison of the displacement of [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB by pirenzepine in microsomal fractions from rabbit iris, ileal muscle and cerebral cortex revealed the presence of a single subtype of mAChR in the iris which had an affinity for PZ that was slightly higher than that of ileal M2 receptors, but lower than that of brain M1 receptors. This suggests that the mAChRs in the iris may represent a subclass of receptors within the M2 subtype, or they may constitute an entirely different subtype of mAChRs.", 
    "75": "Alprazolam was added, under double-blind conditions, to stable fluphenazine hydrochloride regimens in 12 symptomatic, chronically ill inpatients with schizophrenia. The addition of alprazolam was associated with significant, albeit modest, reductions in global psychosis, thought disorder, and paranoia ratings, with a return to pretreatment levels on discontinuation of alprazolam treatment. Improvement in \"negative symptoms\" such as emotional withdrawal paralleled the changes in \"positive symptoms\" but did not, in itself, reach statistical significance. There were no significant changes in group mean plasma levels of homovanillic acid or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol during alprazolam treatment, although group mean serum cortisol levels were significantly decreased by alprazolam treatment. Patients who responded favorably to alprazolam treatment were significantly more psychotic or anxious before treatment, were older, showed significant alprazolam-associated reductions in plasma levels of homovanillic acid, and had significantly more prominent prefrontal cortex atrophy on computed tomographic scans than patients in whom alprazolam was without therapeutic effect. These preliminary data, based on a small sample, suggest that some patients with schizophrenia who are only partially responsive to standard neuroleptic treatment may benefit from the addition of triazolobenzodiazepines, such as alprazolam.", 
    "76": "Fifty-five schizophrenic outpatients with negative symptoms were treated for up to six weeks by the addition of alprazolam (mean dose, 4.2 mg/d), diazepam (mean dose, 40.4 mg/d), or placebo to their ongoing neuroleptic treatment. A repeated-measures analysis of variance with baseline measurements entered as covariates indicated the presence of a significant time X drug interaction effect for the weekly Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) withdrawal/retardation subfactor scores. During the initial weeks of the study, the alprazolam-treated group had lower scores, while the diazepam-treated group had higher scores than the placebo-treated group. However, an end point analysis performed on the final BPRS withdrawal/retardation subfactor scores showed no significant differences among the three groups, nor were beneficial effects observed on any of the BPRS subfactor scores that assess positive symptoms. Plasma alprazolam levels were maintained throughout the study and ranged from 20 to 100 ng/mL. These results suggest that alprazolam had no sustained significant effect on negative schizophrenic symptoms.", 
    "77": "The use of the broad range of antidepressant drugs in depression, panic agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety is reviewed and the current ambiguous status of the benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders discussed. The place of newer antianxiety drugs (buspirone, propranolol) and antidepressant drugs (floxetine, bupropion, trazodone) in treatment is considered. Methods for adjusting dose and counteracting common drug side effects are presented."
