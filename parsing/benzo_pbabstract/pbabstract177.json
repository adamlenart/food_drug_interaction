A further aim of the work was to investigate the effects of different CDs on the morphology, loading, and release properties of the MPs prepared. For these purposes, ETZ alone, and ETZ/CD-PLGA loaded MPs were prepared by the W/O/W emulsion-solvent evaporation method. It was found that the release of ETZ in vitro was more prolonged over three days with a kinetic constant proportional to t(1/2). It was also demonstrated that the CDs in these MPs are able to modulate several properties such as morphology, drug loading, and release properties. In fact, marked differences in shape, surface, and encapsulation efficiencies were noted depending on the presence, hydrophilicity, and charge of the CD employed. The obtained results induce us to consider the present ETZ-containing formulations as new valuable tools for the treatment of different insomnia categories.", 
    "1": "In late 2004, NSW Health received several reports of a serious desquamating rash among clients of the methadone program. We sought to identify the extent and likely cause of this outbreak. We initiated active surveillance for cases throughout Australia, a survey of dosing points in NSW, and a case control study of clients receiving methadone syrup (MS) at two clinics. Between October 2004 and March 2005, 388 cases were identified, largely in NSW. The dosing point survey found almost all cases were clients prescribed MS (attack rate 4.5%). In multivariate analysis of data from dosing points that dispensed MS, use of take away doses or location of the dosing point in greater western Sydney were associated with illness. In the case control study, MS injection, use of street MS, high doses of MS, frequent takeaway doses, or use of benzodiazepines were associated with illness. Testing found no abnormality in associated batches of MS. Batches of MS temporally associated with the outbreak were quarantined from use and the outbreak subsided. While a direct causal link could not be established, available evidence suggests that a contaminant may have caused the outbreak. Epidemiological analyses are important for assessing concerns about product safety following marketing approval.",

    "4": "We present the case of a 14-year-old female who had many characteristics of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) without pyrexia following a single depot injection of 200 mg of zuclopenthixol. The patient presented with a change in mental status that had progressed over the preceding 48 hours. Subsequently, she became increasingly agitated and confused, and developed diffuse muscular rigidity, mutism, tremor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, sialorrhea, and incontinence. Results of laboratory tests showed elevated CPK levels, leukocytosis, and a low serum iron level. Bromocriptine and diazepam were used as initial treatment of a probable NMS and provided significant improvement. During the next seven days, she clinically improved but continued to exhibit emotional lability, logorrhea, elevated mood, and increased psychomotor activity. Therefore, bromocriptine and diazepam were discontinued and lorazepam and lithium were administered as treatment of a bipolar disorder. Four weeks later, she was discharged in stable condition. The presentation of this case report suggests that the primary psychiatric diagnosis is important in antipsychotic usage in the pediatric population, and that young patients receiving neuroleptic treatment should be monitored for the early signs of NMS. Using the diagnostic criteria of a neuroleptic toxicity spectrum may result in greater clinical awareness and earlier recognition of NMS.",

    "9": "A review of U.S. poison center data for 2004 showed over 12,000 exposures to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce healthcare costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate prehospital triage and management of patients with suspected ingestions of TCAs by 1) describing the manner in which an ingestion of a TCA might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of TCA ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of TCAs alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on their combined toxicities. This guideline is based on the assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with suspected self-harm or who are the victims of malicious administration of a TCA should be referred to an emergency department immediately (Grade D). 2) Patients with acute TCA ingestions who are less than 6 years of age and other patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation including standard history taking and determination of the presence of co-ingestants (especially other psychopharmaceutical agents) and underlying exacerbating conditions, such as convulsions or cardiac arrhythmias. Ingestion of a TCA in combination with other drugs might warrant referral to an emergency department. The ingestion of a TCA by a patient with significant underlying cardiovascular or neurological disease should cause referral to an emergency department at a lower dose than for other individuals. Because of the potential severity of TCA poisoning, transportation by EMS, with close monitoring of clinical status and vital signs en route, should be considered (Grade D). 3) Patients who are symptomatic (e.g., weak, drowsy, dizzy, tremulous, palpitations) after a TCA ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade B). 4) Ingestion of either of the following amounts (whichever is lower) would warrant consideration of referral to an emergency department: an amount that exceeds the usual maximum single therapeutic dose or an amount equal to or greater than the lowest reported toxic dose. For all TCAs except desipramine, nortriptyline, trimipramine, and protriptyline, this dose is >5 mg/kg. For despiramine it is >2.5 mg/kg; for nortriptyline it is >2.5 mg/kg; for trimipramine it is >2.5 mg/kg; and for protriptyline it is >1 mg/kg. This recommendation applies to both patients who are na\u00efve to the specific TCA and to patients currently taking cyclic antidepressants who take extra doses, in which case the extra doses should be added to the daily dose taken and then compared to the threshold dose for referral to an emergency department (Grades B/C). 5) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 6) The risk-to-benefit ratio of prehospital activated charcoal for gastrointestinal decontamination in TCA poisoning is unknown. Prehospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grades B/D). 7) For unintentional poisonings, asymptomatic patients are unlikely to develop symptoms if the interval between the ingestion and the initial call to a poison center is greater than 6 hours. These patients do not need referral to an emergency department facility (Grade C). 8) Follow-up calls to determine the outcome for a TCA ingestions ideally should be made within 4 hours of the initial call to a poison center and then at appropriate intervals thereafter based on the clinical judgment of the poison center staff (Grade D). 9) An ECG or rhythm strip, if available, should be checked during the prehospital assessment of a TCA overdose patient. A wide-complex arrhythmia with a QRS duration longer than 100 msec is an indicator that the patient should be immediately stabilized, given sodium bicarbonate if there is a protocol for its use, and transported to an emergency department (Grade B). 10) Symptomatic patients with TCA poisoning might require prehospital interventions, such as intravenous fluids, cardiovascular agents, and respiratory support, in accordance with standard ACLS guidelines (Grade D). 11) Administration of sodium bicarbonate might be beneficial for patients with severe or life-threatening TCA toxicity if there is a prehospital protocol for its use (Grades B/D). 12) For TCA-associated convulsions, benzodiazepines are recommended (Grade D). 13) Flumazenil is not recommended for patients with TCA poisoning (Grade D).",

Consequently dextromethorphan, flurbiprofen, midazolam and other compounds are commonly used as probe substrates to evaluate cytochrome P450 function in humans. A \"cocktail\" approach employing simultaneous administration of two or more of the probe substrates has been used by various investigators in recent years. An analytical strategy to simultaneously extract and analyze dextromethorphan, flurbiprofen and midazolam and their major metabolites (dextrorphan, 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen and 1'-hydroxy-midazolam) by HPLC-MS/fluorescence was developed and is described here. The three probe substrates and their major metabolites were extracted simultaneously by means of a solid-phase (Bond Elut Certify cartridges) extraction procedure from 200 microl of pig plasma. The extraction efficiency was more than 79.5% for each of the six analytes. The extracted compounds were chromatographically separated on a Luna C8(II) column (50 mm Lx3 mm ID) in a single run of 20 min and analyzed by either fluorescence (flurbiprofen and 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen) or selective ion monitoring (dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, midazolam and 1'-hydroxy-midazolam) with positive electrospray ionization. The limit of quantification was 2.5 ng/ml for midazolam and 5 ng/ml for the other five analytes. The assay was precise and accurate (error: -9.1 to 12.1) with total CVs of 13.9% or better for each of the 6 analytes. This method was used to analyze concentrations of the three probes and their metabolites in plasma after intravenous administration to a healthy pig.",

To investigate the mechanism of alpha subunit selectivity of zolpidem, docking calculations were used to illustrate the potential binding modes of zolpidem with different alpha subtypes. The results revealed that there were three reasons resulting in the distinct binding affinity of zolpidem to different alpha subtype. Firstly, the number of hydrogen bonds of agonist-receptor complex would determine the magnitude of binding affinity. Secondly, the His residue in loop A of alpha subunit was indicated as a key role of benzodiazepine binding. Thirdly, the side chain of Glu in loop C reduced the affinity of zolpidem to those receptors containing alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 subunits.",

Hypnotic benzodiazepines promote rapid onset of sleep, uninterrupted sleep and longer duration of sleep in the absence of carryover sedation the following morning; therefore, these may be appropriate for use in older patients. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lormetazepam in elderly patients with primary insomnia when used in association with sleep hygiene training (SHT). The impact of restored sleep on daily sleepiness was also investigated.", 
    "24": "In this open-label study, 30 elderly outpatients with insomnia were randomised to receive 2 weeks of treatment with lormetazepam 0.5mg + SHT or SHT alone, followed by a 1-week observation period. Details on sleep latency, number of awakenings and freshness on awakening were recorded by patients in a daily sleep diary. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) were used to measure daily sleepiness.", 
    "25": "Addition of lormetazepam to SHT improved all sleep parameters measured compared with SHT alone. Mean duration of sleep improved significantly from baseline (mean rank=1.00) in the lormetazepam + SHT group after 2 weeks of treatment (mean rank 2.87; Friedmann test=27.448; p<0.001), but declined significantly in the group receiving SHT alone (from mean rank 2.33 to 1.57; Friedmann test=6.465; p<0.05). Mean duration of sleep increased by approximately 150 minutes each night in the lormetazepam + SHT group but decreased by more than 30 minutes in the SHT-only group. Improvement in sleep quality from baseline was statistically significant only in the lormetazepam + SHT group: for both deepness of sleep and the perception of awakening refreshed, mean scores increased from approximately 3 at baseline to approximately 8 (on a scale of 1-10) after 2 weeks in this group. Sleep latency also decreased significantly in the lormetazepam + SHT group: after 2 weeks, on average patients were awakening less than once per night. SSS and ESS scores also improved significantly in the lormetazepam + SHT group; in contrast, in the SHT-only group, the mean ESS score worsened significantly from baseline and the mean SSS score remained relatively constant. No rebound insomnia was reported during follow-up in patients in the lormetazepam group. Vital signs did not change from baseline and no adverse events were reported for either group.",

    "27": "Anxiety disorders are prevalent and associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, particularly when present with additional psychiatric disorders. They represent a public health and economic burden, yet they are commonly underrecognized and undertreated. Benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytics, but they primarily treat the somatic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and are not effective in treating the depressive symptoms that are often comorbid in chronic anxiety disorders like GAD. Some antidepressants may therefore offer the best choice of therapy. Their benefit in the treatment of GAD has been demonstrated using the tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine, and some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine extended release (XR), has been indicated for GAD and has proven to be effective in both the short- and long-term treatment of patients with this disorder. Many patients treated with venlafaxine XR achieve and sustain remission from the symptoms of GAD, which is the goal of treatment.", 
    "28": "The treatment of pathologic aerophagia has rarely been discussed in the literature. In this retrospective study, the authors investigated the effects of clonazepam on the management of pathologic childhood aerophagia (PCA) with psychological stresses (PS), but not with mental retardation. Data from 22 consecutive PCA patients with PS (aged 2 to 10 yr), who had been followed up for over 1 yr, were reviewed. On the basis of videolaryngoscopic views, the authors observed that the pathology of aerophagia was the result of reflex-induced swallowing with paroxysmal openings of the upper esophageal sphincter due to unknown factors and also observed that these reflex-induced openings were subsided after intravenous low dose benzodiazepine administration. Hence, clonazepam was administered to treat paroxysmal openings in these PCA patients with PS. Remission positivity was defined as symptom-free for a consecutive 1 month within 6 months of treatment. The results of treatment in 22 PCA patients with PS were analyzed. A remission positive state was documented in 14.3% of PCA patients managed by reassurance, and in 66.7% of PCA patients treated with clonazepam (p=0.032). Thus, clonazepam may produce positive results in PCA with PS. Future studies by randomized and placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm the favorable effect of clonazepam in PCA.", 
    "29": "Sleep disorders, especially insomnia, are common in older adults. These disorders are frequently treated using non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Nonetheless, there is a relative lack of data regarding the use of these agents in the elderly, and whether any of these medications is superior to any other in the class when used in the elderly is also unclear. In this article, we review, by way of the published literature, the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, efficacy and safety of zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, eszopiclone and ramelteon in the elderly. Special emphasis is placed on identifying relevant differences between these medications when used in older adults with insomnia. Based primarily on data from placebo-controlled trials, the non-benzodiazepines reviewed were found to be most effective at improving sleep latency and sleep quality, and least effective at enhancing total sleep time. The efficacy of ramelteon was limited to improving sleep latency, while all other agents, especially at higher doses, were found to produce improvement in both sleep latency and some improvement in total sleep time. All of the medications were found to be well tolerated in the elderly. From pharmacokinetic and drug-drug interaction perspectives, zaleplon and ramelteon offer the advantage of not being primarily metabolised via the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme. In conclusion, based on relatively limited data, zopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone and ramelteon represent modestly effective and generally well tolerated treatments for insomnia in older adults. While some actual and potential differences exist among these medications, more comparative trials are needed.",

    "31": "The purpose of this study was describe two patients with rapid recovery of refractory late postpartum eclampsia (LPPE) following uterine curettage, and to evaluate the literature about supportive evidence for such a management in LPPE. A detailed literature search was performed focusing on studies reporting the clinical presentation, laboratory workup, imaging, and management of LPPE. Mean reported onset of LPPE was on postpartum day 7.0 +/- 2.9. Only 35.3% had a history of preeclampsia: these had earlier onset of seizures compared with the subjects without history of preeclampsia (4.3 +/- 1.4 versus 7.6 +/- 2.9 days; p < 0.005). Onset of seizure was correlated with systolic blood pressure (Pearson's r = 0.34; p < 0.05). Major associated symptoms were headaches (71.4%), visual changes (46.0%), and nausea/vomiting (22.2%); 67.5% of patients were proteinuric. The remaining laboratory tests were usually normal. Among the patients with a normal head computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging identified additional abnormalities in 53.8% (seven of 13). A total of 69.7% of patients developed multiple seizure episodes, some of these occurred while the patient was receiving magnesium sulfate treatment; 82.5% of patients underwent magnesium therapy and approximately half of those patients required multiple antiseizure drugs. The number of seizures was only correlated with the diastolic blood pressure (Pearson's r = 0.52; p < 0.01). Even remote from delivery, headaches, visual change, and nausea/vomiting are important symptoms of LPPE. Hypertension and/or proteinuria are important diagnostic findings. LPPE is often characterized by refractory seizures and controlling the diastolic blood pressure is important. Patients presented in our case report showed no seizures after uterine curettage.

In the first angiogram, vasospasm was detected in the supraclinoid portion of the ICA. Intra-arterial verapamil was started; during this treatment, the patient developed right-sided focal motor seizures. The infusion was terminated and the seizures were halted with midazolam. The patient's course was unremarkable until postoperative day 7, when she developed expressive aphasia, for which she was taken for emergent cerebral angiography under anesthesia. Marked focal spasm was identified in the distal supraclinoid ICA and the left A1. The patient was treated with 25 mg of superselective verapamil infusion.

Variants of SPS include those with focal limb dysfunction (stiff-limb syndrome), encephalomyelitis (\"SPS plus\"), and those associated with paraneoplastic autoantibodies. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, an autoimmune etiology for SPS is proposed, based on its association with autoantibodies and other autoimmune diseases and its response to immunomodulatory therapy. The cornerstone of treatment consists of symptomatic care with benzodiazepines and/or baclofen. Other neuromodulators include antiepileptic medications and muscle relaxants. Continued disability despite first-line therapy should prompt consideration of agents aimed at immunomodulation and immunosuppression. Intravenous immunoglobulin is one of the few agents to be evaluated in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Other options include steroids, plasma exchange, and chemotherapy agents.", 
    "40": "Cannabinoid ligands show therapeutic potential in a variety of disorders including anxiety. However, the anxiety-related effects of cannabinoids remain controversial as agonists show opposite effects in mice and rats. Here we compared the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212 and the CB1 antagonist AM-251 in CD1 mice and Wistar rats. Special attention was paid to antagonist-agonist interactions, which had not yet been studied in rats. In mice, WIN-55,212 decreased whereas AM-251 increased anxiety. The antagonist abolished the effects of the agonist. In contrast, WIN-55,212 increased anxiety in rats. Surprisingly, the antagonist potentiated this effect. Cannabinoids affect both GABAergic and glutamatergic functions, which play opposite roles in anxiety. We hypothesized that discrepant findings resulted from species differences in the relative responsiveness of the two transmitter systems to cannabinoids. We investigated this hypothesis by studying the effects of WIN-55,212 on evoked hippocampal inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs and EPSCs). IPSCs were one order of magnitude more sensitive to WIN-55,212 in mice than in rats. In mice, IPSCs were more sensitive than EPSCs to WIN-55,212. This is the first study showing that the relative cannabinoid sensitivity of GABA and glutamate neurotransmission is species-dependent. Based on behavioural and electrophysiological findings, we hypothesize that WIN-55,212 reduced anxiety in mice by affecting GABA neurotransmission whereas it increased anxiety in rats via glutamatergic mechanisms. In rats, AM-251 potentiated this anxiogenic effect by inhibiting the anxiolytic GABAergic mechanism. We suggest that the anxiety-related effects of cannabinoids depend on the relative cannabinoid responsiveness of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.",

Rectal temperature decreased over the anaesthetic period was not significantly different between the two groups; however, oesophageal temperature decrease was significantly less in group KMT [1.1 degrees C (-0.1-+2.7 degrees C)] than in group KMZ [1.4 degrees C (0.6-3.1 degrees C)].",

Fifty adult mechanically ventilated surgical and general intensive care unit patients receiving sedative infusions of morphine and midazolam were randomly allocated to receive BIS monitoring (n=25) or standard sedation management (n=25). In the BIS group, sedation was titrated to maintain a BIS value of greater than 70. In the standard management group, sedative needs were titrated based on subjective assessment and clinical signs. There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of sedation administered (morphine P = 0.67 and midazolam P = 0.85). However, there was a statistically significant difference in sedation administration over time. Patients in the BIS group received increasing amounts of sedation over time whilst those in the control group received decreasing amounts of sedation over time. The same inverse relationship existed for both sedative agents (morphine P = 0.005, midazolam P = 0.03). Duration of mechanical ventilation was comparable in the two groups. We conclude that the use of BIS monitoring did not reduce the amount of sedation used, the length of mechanical ventilation time or the length of ICU stay.",

Low dose haloperidol did not have a higher incidence of adverse effects than the atypical antipsychotics. High dose haloperidol (> 4.5 mg per day) in one study was associated with an increased incidence of extrapyramidal adverse effects, compared with olanzapine. Low dose haloperidol decreased the severity and duration of delirium in post-operative patients, although not the incidence of delirium, compared to placebo controls in one study. There were no controlled trials comparing quetiapine with haloperidol.",

High dose haloperidol was associated with a greater incidence of side effects, mainly parkinsonism, than the atypical antipsychotics. Low dose haloperidol may be effective in decreasing the degree and duration of delirium in post-operative patients, compared with placebo. These conclusions must be tempered by the observation that they are based on small studies of limited scope, and therefore will require further corroborating evidence before they can be translated into specific recommendation for the treatment of delirium.",

The rapidity of the therapeutic effect of PAN therapy coupled with the minimal sedative requirements, may enable patients to enter the psychological treatment phase more quickly than those on sedative regimens, accelerating the patients recovery. Our review does not provide strong evidence due to the small sample sizes of the included trials. Neither does the review indicate any causes for concern that PAN is more harmful than the benzodiazepines. Clinicians wishing to use PAN may initially wish to do so within trial settings. Further high quality trials should be done to confirm these findings and to investigate whether the PAN therapy has fewer adverse effects than other treatments for the alcohol withdrawal states. Studies to investigate the possible cost-effectiveness of PAN by reducing costly hospital admissions and decreasing post administration supervision also need to be performed.",

Caffeine coadministration modestly increased maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of zolpidem by 30-40%, whereas zolpidem did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of caffeine or its metabolites. Compared to P+P, Z+P significantly increased sedation, impaired digit-symbol substitution test performance, slowed tapping speed and reaction time, increased EEG relative beta amplitude, and impaired delayed recall. Caffeine partially, but not completely, reversed most pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem. Thus, caffeine only incompletely reverses zolpidem's sedative and performance-impairing effects, and cannot be considered as an antidote to benzodiazepine agonists.",

This multicenter, open-label study explored D(2) receptor occupancy of a fixed dose of olanzapine pamoate (OP) depot given every 4 weeks. Patients (nine male, five female) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder previously stabilized on oral olanzapine were switched to OP depot 300 mg by intramuscular injection every 4 weeks for 6 months. No visitwise within-group significant changes were found in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Total or Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scores, although seven patients received oral olanzapine supplementation during the first four injection cycles. To minimize impact on D(2) occupancy, positron emission tomography (PET) scans were not completed during injection cycles that required supplemental oral olanzapine. Two patients reported transient injection site adverse events, which did not result in discontinuation. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were insomnia, aggravated psychosis, and anxiety. Mean striatal D(2) receptor occupancy, as measured by [(11)C]-raclopride PET, was 69% on oral olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) and 50% (trough) on OP depot at steady state. Following an initial decline, occupancy returned to 84% of baseline oral olanzapine occupancy after six injections. Over the study period, D(2) receptor occupancy and plasma olanzapine concentrations were significantly correlated (r=0.76, P</=0.001). OP depot resulted in mean D(2) receptor occupancy of approximately 60% or higher at the end of the 6-month study period, a level consistent with antipsychotic efficacy and found during treatment with oral olanzapine. However, supplemental oral olanzapine or another dosing strategy may be necessary to maintain adequate therapeutic response during the first few injection cycles.",

However, the mechanisms contributing to the effects of rifaximin on chronic gastrointestinal disorders are not fully understood. In the current study, rifaximin was investigated for its role in activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in xenobiotic and limited endobiotic deposition and detoxication. PXR-humanized (hPXR), Pxr-null, and wild-type mice were treated orally with rifaximin, and rifampicin, a well characterized human PXR ligand. Rifaximin was highly concentrated in the intestinal tract compared with rifampicin. Rifaximin treatment resulted in significant induction of PXR target genes in the intestine of hPXR mice, but not in wild-type and Pxr-null mice. However, rifaximin treatment demonstrated no significant effect on hepatic PXR target genes in wild-type, Pxr-null, and hPXR mice. Consistent with the in vivo data, cell-based reporter gene assay revealed rifaximin-mediated activation of human PXR, but not the other xenobiotic nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, PPARgamma, and farnesoid X receptor. Pretreatment with rifaximin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A substrate midazolam, but it increased the C(max) and decreased T(max) of 1'-hydroxymidazolam. Collectively, the current study identified rifaximin as a gut-specific human PXR ligand, and it provided further evidence for the utility of hPXR mice as a critical tool for the study of human PXR activators. Further human studies are suggested to assess the potential role of rifaximin-mediated gut PXR activation in therapeutics of chronic gastrointestinal disorders.",

    "88": "As inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, clinical presentations of poisoning from organophosphate compounds are generally believed to entail overstimulation by the accumulated acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors at peripheral and central synapses. That some patients still yielded to acute organophosphate poisoning despite repeated dosing of atropine suggests that cellular mechanisms that are independent of muscarinic receptor activation may also be engaged in organophosphate poisoning. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor-independent activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) in rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a medullary site where sympathetic vasomotor tone originates and where the organophosphate poison mevinphos (Mev) acts, is involved in the cardiovascular responses exhibited during organophosphate intoxication. In Sprague-Dawley rats, microinjection bilaterally of Mev (10 nmol) into the RVLM significantly augmented PKA activity in ventrolateral medulla that was not antagonized by coadministration of an equimolar concentration (1 nmol) of atropine or selective muscarinic receptor type M1 (pirenzepine), M2 (methoctramine), M3 (4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-dimethylpiperidinium), or M4 (tropicamide) inhibitor.

However, the existing definition of SE in newborns is not precise and not easily applied in clinical investigations or in clinical practice. To evaluate the underlying conditions, clinical features and treatment of SE in neonates in Japan, a retrospective multi-center study was performed. In the initial investigation, questionnaires were sent to pediatric neurologists in 194 neonatal intensive care units of university hospitals, children's hospitals, and general hospitals throughout in Japan. The questionnaires sought information on the background of each case, types of seizures, etiology of SE, treatments, results and adverse effects of treatment for patients less than 1 week old who had prolonged or frequently repeated seizures lasting more than 15 min and who are refractory to treatment with conventional anticonvulsants, such as diazepam (DZP), phenobarbital (PB) or phenytoin (PHT). As a secondary investigation, 65 cases from nine institutes, which completely fulfilled these criteria and were treated with midazolam (MDL) or lidocaine (Lid) to stop seizures were examined more fully. Subtle seizure and generalized tonic-clonic seizure were the most frequent seizure types. Neonatal SE was most frequently associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, followed by intraventricular hemorrhage, central nervous system infections, and cerebral infarction. The final treatment outcome was available for 72.7% and 81.3% of MDL- and Lid-treated patients, respectively. Adverse effects of MDL and Lid were identified in 7.3% and 6.3% of patients, respectively.

    "100": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is relatively common; it comprises at least one third of all cases of status epilepticus. NCSE may be an even more common, yet more elusive, condition in the elderly population. NCSE can be divided into complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE), NCSE in coma, and typical absence status epilepticus (TAS). The clinical manifestations may be subtle, and thus the diagnosis of these conditions is critically dependent on electroencephalography (EEG). When EEG demonstrates typical ictal patterns, the diagnosis is usually straightforward. However, in many circumstances the EEG pattern has to be differentiated from other encephalopathic patterns, and this differentiation can prove troublesome; clinical and electrographic response to treatment can prove helpful in these situations. The prognosis for NCSE in the elderly is generally poor due to the underlying etiology rather than the persistence of electrographic discharges. Whether the neuronal damage that occurs in convulsive status epilepticus and in animal models of limbic status epilepticus also occurs in NCSE in humans is still a matter of debate. Intravenous treatment is not benign, especially in the elderly, who may be at greater risk of systemic complications from hypotensive and sedative agents. Therefore, a more conservative approach to the treatment of NCSE in the elderly is warranted. Oral benzodiazepines should be used for the treatment of TAS and CPSE in noncomatose patients with a prior history of epilepsy, and in some circumstances, intravenous medication may be necessary. Generally, anesthetic coma should not be advised in either of these conditions. A more aggressive approach may be required with NCSE in coma, in the hope of improving a very poor prognosis. Treatment regimens will remain largely speculative until there are more relevant animal models and controlled trials of conservative versus aggressive treatment.",

The annual incidence (86/100,000) of SE in the elderly who are aged 60 and greater is almost twice that of the general population and is even higher in those who are 70 years and older. Either acute or remote symptomatic stroke causes approximately 60% of SE seen in the elderly. SE is associated with a high mortality in the elderly (38%), with a rate approaching 50% in patients older than 80 years of age. Etiology is a strong determinant of mortality in the elderly: mortality approaches 100% in patients with anoxia and 30% in patients with either metabolic disorders, hemorrhages, tumors, or systemic infections. Mortality is almost three times higher in SE associated with acute ischemic stroke than in stroke alone, indicating synergistic effects. Duration of SE is also a factor in mortality. Treatment should be initiated for any convulsive seizure that lasts at least 10 min or is repetitive. An electroencephalogram (EEG) should be promptly obtained so that a diagnosis can be made without delay. Because older patients have a greater likelihood of nondiagnostic findings on routine EEGs, prolonged EEG recordings and inpatient video-EEG monitoring significantly increase the rate of establishing a definitive diagnosis. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus in the elderly is especially difficult to diagnose and should be evaluated with an EEG. Treatment of SE is complicated by altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly. Initial treatments, usually the administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine, have overall success rates of 55% for overt convulsive SE and 14.9% for subtle SE. For refractory SE, little is gained by using additional standard drugs, and general anesthesia with continuous EEG monitoring is recommended.", 
    "102": "Cholesterol is a vital component of cellular membranes, and is the substrate for biosynthesis of steroids, oxysterols and bile acids. The mechanisms directing the intracellular trafficking of this nearly insoluble molecule have received increased attention through the discovery of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and similar proteins containing StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domains. StAR can transfer cholesterol between synthetic liposomes in vitro, an activity which appears to correspond to the trans-cytoplasmic transport of cholesterol to mitochondria. However, trans-cytoplasmic cholesterol transport in vivo appears to involve the recently-described protein StarD4, which is expressed in most cells. Steroidogenic cells must also move large amounts of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the first steroidogenic enzyme, which lies on the matrix side of the inner membrane; this action requires StAR. Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, a rare and severe disorder of human steroidogenesis, results from mutations in StAR, providing a StAR knockout of nature that has provided key insights into its activity. Cell biology experiments show that StAR moves large amounts of cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane, but acts exclusively on the outer membrane. Biophysical data show that only the carboxyl-terminal alpha-helix of StAR interacts with the outer membrane. Spectroscopic data and molecular dynamics simulations show that StAR's interactions with protonated phospholipid head groups on the outer mitochondrial membrane induce a conformational change (molten globule transition) needed for StAR's activity. StAR appears to act in concert with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, but the precise itinerary of a cholesterol molecule entering the mitochondrion remains unclear.", 
    "103": "Some patients undergoing epilepsy surgery suffer from early postoperative seizures which may have a negative impact on later outcome. Factors contributing to these seizures have not to date been examined systematically. We hypothesized that reduction of postoperative serum levels of antiepileptic drugs (AED) may be one risk factor for early postoperative seizures.", 
    "104": "We retrospectively reviewed medical records from 20 patients treated with lamotrigine (LTG) who underwent epilepsy surgery between January 1997 and February 2004. Demographic data, anaesthesiological and surgical procedures, co-medication, and pre- as well as one or more postoperative LTG serum levels were evaluated.", 
    "105": "We found a significant decrease in LTG serum levels, amounting to more than 20% (mean 46%, range 21.9-69.1%), in 16 of 20 patients (80%). Six patients (30%) suffered from seizures in the first 2 weeks after surgery. In three patients, postoperative seizures occurred isochronically with the LTG serum level nadir. The magnitude of the reduction in serum levels was not influenced by age, sex, duration of the operation, the type of anaesthetic drugs or the postoperative co-medication.", 
    "106": "Reductions in LTG serum levels are a relevant contributing factor for early postoperative seizures. Postoperative alteration of the gastrointestinal motility and transient time leading to delayed absorption and reduced bioavailability of AED may be a major risk factor. Therefore, close monitoring of postoperative LTG serum levels is necessary and should lead to a temporary dose augmentation and/or anticonvulsant co-medication with benzodiazepines in case of a pronounced reduction of serum levels.", 
    "107": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an under-recognized cause of altered mental status. There are hardly any reported data on NCSE in developing countries.", 
    "108": "Prospectively 210 consecutive patients with altered mental status admitted to neurological intensive care unit (NICU) of a tertiary care center in south India were studied for the frequency of NCSE. All patients were evaluated initially with 60-min emergent EEG (EmEEG) and subsequently by continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring.", 
    "109": "Of the 210 with altered mental status admitted to NICU, the diagnosis of NCSE was established in 22 (10.5%) patients, in 12 (55%) patients with 60-min EmEEG and in 10 (45%) after cEEG monitoring for 12 to 48 hours. Of the 22 patients with NCSE, 32% had subtle motor phenomena, these were not an initial presenting features, but were apparent during cEEG recording. Acute medical or neurologic etiology was the risk factor in 68% of patients. Central nervous system (CNS) infections and cortical sino-venous thrombosis (CSVT), respectively, accounted for 23% and 14% of the etiologies. Intravenous midazolam terminated NCSE in 19 patients and valproate in 2. Of the 15 patients with acute symptomatic NCSE, 4 (18%) had poor prognosis (3 deaths and one persistent vegetative state). The etiological risk factors in the 9 (41%) patients with excellent outcome included epilepsy (3), remote symptomatic (2), cryptogenic (1), and metabolic and drugs (3).", 
    "110": "The frequency of NCSE in the current study was comparable with those in prior reports from developed countries. CNS infections accounted for about a fifth of the etiology. Outcome was excellent in patients with nonacute symptomatic NCSE. Initial 60-min EmEEG may be performed in establishing the diagnosis of NCSE, but almost half of patients with NCSE will be missed with this approach.", 
    "111": "The goal of medical therapy for primary dystonia is conservative. While botulinum toxin (BTX) therapy is a first choice for blepharospasm and cervical dystonia, medical therapy is selected as such for other types of dystonia. As oral medications, trihexyphenidyl and benzodiazepines are most frequently used. Muscle relaxants are also commonly used, but dopamine antagonists are not recommended because of the risk of inducing tardive dyskinesia. For childhood-onset generalized dystonia, levodopa should be considered to rule out levodopa-responsive dystonia. Mexiletine is reported to be effective not only for bleharospasm and cervical dystonia but for focal limb dystonia. To improve the therapeutic performance of BTX therapy for blepharospasm, it is recommended that corrugator supercilii and procerus muscles, as well as orbicularis oculi muscle, be added as target muscles. To improve the therapeutic performance of BTX therapy for cervical dystonia, it is recommended that this therapy be started as early as possible, especially within one year of illness, and that levator scapulae muscle be added as target if necessary. To improve usefulness of medical therapy for dystonia, its strategy must be standardized, and more useful therapies must be positively adopted. Algorithm for treatment of dystonia must also be established and generalized.", 
    "112": "The authors investigated the effect of diazepam on clinically relevant measures from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations. Twenty volunteers were scanned twice. Using a double-blind randomized study design, the volunteers received placebo on one occasion, and on the other, 5 mg of diazepam. Three functional tests were used: motor, word generation, and working memory. Images were analyzed individually for each subject and the number of activated voxels and the laterality index were calculated. No significant effects related to the drug were detected. In contrast, the motor and working memory tasks showed a significant decrease in the number of activated voxels between Sessions 1 and 2, independently of diazepam administration. These results indicate that diazepam may be administered for premedication prior to fMRI investigations.", 
    "113": "Regional anaesthesia (RA) provides well-defined benefits with known attendant risks. However, incomplete blockade may introduce unanticipated risks depending on the compensatory measures employed. Until now, no data were available characterizing the pattern of response of German anaesthesiologists in this situation. This study analyses interventions in response to incomplete RA in a nation-wide setting.", 
    "114": "A questionnaire was sent to every German anaesthesia department (n= 1381). Questions focused on interventions coping with an incomplete RA and differentiated between a pre- and a peri-surgical setting and measures to face pain outside the surgical field. If systemic supplementation was administered, we analysed the substances and characterized their influence on subsequent patient care.", 
    "115": "Six hundred and sixty-seven questionnaires were returned anonymously, representing a return rate of 48.3%. If RA was incomplete before surgery, 56.8% of anaesthesiologists repeated peripheral blocks, 48.5% repeated epidural (EDA) and 60.4% repeated spinal anaesthesia (SPA). 56.9% of clinicians preferred an early switch to general anesthesia (GA). If RA was incomplete during surgery, 49.5% tended to switch early to GA, 13.9% made attempts to avoid this by intensive systemic supplementation. Benzodiazepines and opioids were the most commonly used substances. Pain or discomfort outside the surgical field was widely managed by intravenous supplementation (67.7%) and only 10.6% were willing to switch to general anaesthesia.",

    "118": "This retrospective study was based on administrative claims data extracted from the PharMetrics database during 1999 through 2003. Comparisons were made among atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine or ziprasidone), as well as between each of these versus a combined group of the leading typical antipsychotics. Relative risk for hospitalization was estimated with Cox proportional regression, which adjusted for differences in patient characteristics.", 
    "119": "Risperidone and olanzapine demonstrated higher risks for hospitalization than quetiapine [hazard ratio (HR) 1.19, p < 0.05 for both], translating into higher annual mental health inpatient charges of $260 per patient. Risperidone and olanzapine also showed higher estimated risks than ziprasidone, which approached the p < 0.05 threshold. Differences between each of the atypicals and the combined typicals were not significant. Patients with putative rapid cycling had a threefold greater risk for hospitalization than other patients with bipolar disorder. In these patients, comparisons among atypical antipsychotics showed that risperidone had a significantly higher hospitalization risk than olanzapine (HR 3.31, p < 0.05), resulting in higher annual mental health inpatient charges of $4,930 per patient.", 
    "120": "In the treatment of bipolar and manic disorders, risperidone and olanzapine were associated with a higher risk for hospitalization than quetiapine, and possibly ziprasidone. In the treatment of putative rapid cyclers, olanzapine was associated with a lower risk for hospitalization than risperidone.", 
    "121": "The mechanism of action of praziquantel (PZQ), the drug of choice against schistosomiasis, is still unclear. Since exposure of schistosomes to the drug is associated with calcium influx and muscular contraction, calcium channels have been suggested as the target, although direct combination of PZQ with their subunits was never demonstrated. We report a hitherto unknown effect of PZQ, namely the inhibition of nucleoside uptake, as observed in living worms using radio-isotope labelled adenosine and uridine. This effect is clearly seen in schistosomes but is absent in mammalian cells in culture. Moreover it is a specific pharmacological effect seen exclusively with the active levo-R(-)stereo isomer of the drug, and is shared by at least one benzodiazepine having antischistosomal activity. This novel effect acquires significance given that schistosomes cannot synthesize purine nucleosides de novo. A possible relationship between this novel effect and the known action of PZQ on calcium channels is discussed, since adenosine is known to bind to specific receptors and to behave as an indirect antagonist of calcium release in mammalian cells. If calcium channels were correlated with adenosine receptors also in schistosomes, as they are in mammals, this would support the hypothesis that PZQ-induced calcium influx may be correlated to adenosine receptor blockade.",

Nonhuman primate models, particularly those employing long-term self-administration, are conceptually more similar to human alcoholic individuals.", 
    "123": "We performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings on acutely dissociated amygdala neurons isolated from cynomolgus macaque coronal temporal lobe slices. Slices were prepared from control monkeys or monkeys allowed to self-administer oral ethanol for 18 months. Flunitrazepam and acute ethanol modulation of currents gated by exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) application was assessed in these isolated neurons. Complementary experiments were performed on amygdala total RNA using quantitative real-time reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction to understand potential ethanol-dependent adaptations to subunit composition.", 
    "124": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated currents from ethanol-exposed macaque amygdala neurons exhibited reduced modulation by flunitrazepam compared with control neurons. However, this was specific for benzodiazepines as the modest inhibition of GABA-gated currents by acute ethanol was not affected by the chronic ethanol consumption. We also measured mRNA expression levels for the beta, gamma, and delta subunits in total amygdala RNA isolated from control and ethanol-drinking animals. beta1 and gamma2 expression was significantly reduced in samples from ethanol-exposed amygdala.", 
    "125": "Our findings demonstrate that chronic ethanol self-administration reduces the benzodiazepine sensitivity of amygdala GABA(A) receptors. This reduced sensitivity may be the result of decreased expression of an amygdala gamma subunit. These findings suggest that, while rodent and nonhuman primate models of chronic ethanol exposure share many characteristics, the specific molecular adaptations associated with the amygdala GABAergic system may not be identical.", 
    "126": "Ultrasound studies showed that selective antagonist of central M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors pirenzepine (50 mg/kg intravenously) causes transitory hypotension and respiratory depression in anesthetized intact rats. The M1 receptor antagonist had no effect on cardiac output and portal blood flow. Pretreatment with pirenzepine increased the sensitivity of rats with acute massive hemorrhage to circulatory hypoxia. After blockade of central M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors, the posthemorrhagic period was characterized by primary decompensation of blood pressure, portal blood flow, and respiration and development of low cardiac output syndrome. The animals died over the first minutes after bleeding arrest. Our results indicate that central M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors act as shock-limiting cholinergic structures under conditions of posthemorrhagic changes in systemic and portal blood flow, as well as during respiratory dysfunction.", 
    "127": "The goal of this experiment was to study the influence of the time spent in the safe compartment (30 vs. 1 s) and of an intraperitoneal injection of diazepam (1 mg/kg vs. vehicle) on one-way avoidance learning, in inbred female roman high-avoidance and roman low-avoidance rats. Rats learned to run from a danger compartment, where they received a warning signal (88 dB tone) followed by a 1 mA electric footshock, to a safe compartment, where these stimuli were not presented. The number of trials needed to reach 10 consecutive avoidance responses was the dependent variable. Roman low-avoidance rats exposed to 1 s in the safe compartment showed poorer performance than their roman high-avoidance counterparts. These differences were not observed in rats exposed to 30 s in the safe place, and were abolished by the injection of diazepam. These results suggest the importance of fear and reinforcement in one-way avoidance learning and its usefulness for studying emotional processes underlying genetic or pharmacological manipulations.", 
    "128": "The central histaminergic system is reported to mediate behavioural, hormonal and physiological homeostasis of living organisms. Recent reports indicate its prominent role in various neurobehavioural disorders such as depression and psychosis. This study evaluated the effect of activation of the central histaminergic system in anxiety-like conditions, using the elevated plus-maze test in mice, and elucidated the role of different histaminergic receptors mediating such effects. Peripheral administration of L-histidine (L-His), in a dose-dependent manner, significantly decreased the exploration time in open arms and number of entries into open arms without modifying the number of entries into closed arms of the elevated plus-maze, indicating anxiogenesis. Further, such effects of central histamine were significantly attenuated, in a dose-dependent manner, by pretreatment with pyrilamine (H1 receptor antagonist). Pretreatment with either zolantidine (H2 receptor antagonist) or thioperamide (H3 receptor antagonist), however, failed to attenuate the L-His-induced anxiogenesis. Our results indicate that anxiogenic effects of central histaminergic system appear to be mediated prominently by activation of H1 receptors.", 
    "129": "Benzodiazepine receptor anxiolytics show no selectivity between gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors containing alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 subunits. Pharmacological studies and data emerging from transgenic mouse models, however, predict that compounds with selective affinity and/or efficacy for gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor subtypes would have novel pharmacological profiles. Thus, the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A-alpha1 'affinity selective' drug zolpidem has a sedative-hypnotic profile, whereas L838,417, which has 'selective efficacy' for gamma-aminobutyric acid-A-alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 receptors, has an anxiolytic-like profile. Here, we compare the nonselective benzodiazepine-site-positive modulators diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, alprazolam and zopiclone with (i) gamma-aminobutyric acid-AA-alpha1 affinity selective compounds zolpidem and CL218,872 and (ii) L838,417, in the rat-conditioned emotional response test after systemic administration. Given the role of the basolateral amygdala in anxiety and the expression of alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3 subunits in this region, we also assessed the effects of bilateral infusion of L838,417 and midazolam directly into basolateral amygdala in the conditioned emotional response test. Nonselective modulators at low-moderate doses produced anxiolytic effects and sedation at higher doses. Zolpidem was inactive as an anxiolytic and engendered severe sedation, whereas CL218,872 produced an anxiolytic-like profile with minimal sedation. L838,417 produced an anxiolytic-like profile with no sedation, albeit producing behavioural disturbance at high doses. Infusion of midazolam and L838,417 into basolateral amygdala engendered anxiolytic-like effects, although both compounds were more effective after systemic injections, implicating additional brain sites in their anxiolytic-like actions after systemic administration. In conclusion, the diversity of effects of the compounds studied implicates both intrinsic efficacy and/or subtype selectivity as important determinants of anxiolytic-like effects in the rat-conditioned emotional response test.", 
    "130": "The D2/3 agonist (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine (PHNO) has been reported to enhance the ability of olanzapine to substitute for clozapine and attenuate olanzapine-induced response suppression in monkeys. These data suggest that the relatively marked D2/3 antagonist actions of olanzapine limit its substitution for clozapine. The work reported here replicated and extended these findings. Twelve rats were trained to discriminate clozapine (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) from vehicle in an FR30 quantal food rewarded assay. The substitution curve for olanzapine (0-2.5 mg/kg) was then computed after treatment with either vehicle or a high dose (0.1 mg/kg) of the D2/3 agonist quinpirole. The olanzapine substitution curve was shifted significantly 5.2-fold in parallel to the left by quinpirole. Olanzapine suppressed responding significantly, but this effect was not attenuated or enhanced by quinpirole, which suppressed responding itself. Thus antagonist actions at D2/3 receptors clearly limit the ability of olanzapine to substitute for clozapine. These findings suggest that the clozapine versus vehicle discrimination is probably a bioassay for agents that resemble clozapine but which do not necessarily induce D2/3 antagonism. This discrimination may therefore not specifically detect clozapine-like antipsychotics, although it may be of value in developing such antipsychotics. The low discriminability of antipsychotics in general may be because antagonist actions at D2/3 receptors limit incentive salience in discrimination assays. These data are compatible with recent theorizing that therapeutic actions of antipsychotics in schizophrenia involve D2/3 receptor-mediated attenuation of stimulus salience.", 
    "131": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a trans-mitochondrial membrane protein that modulates steroid biosynthesis. Recently, up-regulation and nuclear localization of PBR has been shown to be associated with colon, prostate, and breast cancer. PBR has been targeted by the exogenous synthetic ligand, PK11195, for various purposes including imaging. To capitalize on these observations, we developed a high-throughput, noninvasive, in vivo imaging approach to detect spontaneously arising colonic tumors in mice using a novel PBR-targeted molecular imaging agent (NIR-conPK11195). NIR-conPK11195 localized and was retained in colonic adenomas and carcinomas in Smad3(-/-) mice but not in non-neoplastic hamartomas or chronically inflamed colonic tissue. Using a fluorescence signal-to-noise ratio of > or =4-fold 13 h after injection of the agent, we detected colonic tumors with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 86% in a cohort of 37 Smad3(-/-) mice and control littermates. Furthermore, using oral administration of dextran sulfate to induce colonic inflammation, we showed that the clearance profile of NIR-conPK11195 distinguished transient uptake in inflammatory tissue from longer term retention in tumors. Taken together, these results indicate that NIR-conPK11195 is a promising optical molecular imaging tool to rapidly screen for colonic tumors in mice and to discriminate inflammation from cancer.", 
    "132": "We investigated the involvement of GABA-A receptors in the modulation of the nicotinic transmission of central origin in isolated rabbit coeliac ganglia. Our study was performed in vitro and the electrical activity of the ganglionic neurones was recorded using intracellular recording techniques. During iterative stimulation of the splanchnic nerves, the synaptic action potential probability decreased gradually, indicating a depression of the nicotinic activation. Pharmacological agents acting at GABA-A receptors modulated the action potential probability during the train of pulses. Muscimol (a GABA-A receptor agonist), diazepam (a benzodiazepine site agonist) and 1-[2-[[(diphenylmethylene)imino]oxy]ethyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride (a GABA uptake blocker) increased this probability. Conversely, gabazine or bicuculline (two GABA-A receptor antagonists), picrotoxin (a picrotoxin site agonist) and flumazenil (a benzodiazepine site antagonist) reduced it. These results demonstrate that endogenous GABA, released during the train of pulses, facilitates the central nicotinic activation of the ganglionic neurones by acting on GABA-A receptors. Muscimol also reduced the amplitude ratio of excitatory postsynaptic potentials triggered during the paired-pulse protocol without any change in postsynaptic properties. This result is consistent with a presynaptic action of GABA-A receptors. Our study shows that presynaptic GABA-A receptors facilitate the central nicotinic activation of prevertebral ganglionic neurones and thus play a novel role in the integrative properties of the sympathetic prevertebral ganglia.",

He was nonverbal, profoundly mentally retarded, and diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and orthopedic problems. He developed episodic movements possibly consistent with EPS secondary to aripiprazole usage. The patient was antipsychotic naive before initiation of aripiprazole 5 mg daily. Concurrent medications at the time of EPS onset included oxazepam, baclofen, and citalopram. Baclofen and oxazepam were prescribed secondary to right-sided hemiparesis contractures. Aripiprazole, 5 mg daily, was initiated in November 2004 as an augmentation strategy for the diagnosis of OCD. Facial, tongue, and arm movements were first reported approximately five weeks after the initiation of aripiprazole. Initial symptoms resolved after approximately 24 hours. The dosage was increased to 10 mg daily two weeks later. Dystonic episodes continued on an intermittent basis, and the patient presented with lower-lip thrusting and upper-limb athetosis. These movements interfered with the patient's eating, chewing, and holding of utensils. Several of the standard treatment strategies for EPS were used. Initially, diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 mg was administered orally every six hours. The patient's movements resolved following diphenhydramine administration. Aripiprazole was subsequently discontinued secondary to its lack of efficacy for OCD and the development of a movement disorder.",

Children used benzodiazepines three times as often as adults. Newer AEDs were mostly used for partial seizures, in accordance with international guidelines. Thirty-five percent of adults and 20% of children suffered from comorbid CNS-related conditions. The use of concomitant medication was widespread. Serum concentrations were in accordance to recommended therapeutic ranges.",

In order to verify this finding, we conducted a new study in 2003-2004 in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, restricted to truck drivers. The aim of this study was to allow harmonizing the professional practice of the occupational physicians, proposing drug prevention and drug testing policies, validating the analytical methods and the guidelines in case of positive testing results. One thousand truck drivers were studied. Urines were tested for amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine and methadone by immunoassay. Urine ethanol determinations were performed by an ADH method. Positive urines for drugs of abuse, methadone or buprenorphine were then tested by gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Out of the 1000 drivers, cannabinoids were detected in 85 cases, opiates in 41 cases, amphetamines in 3 cases and cocaine in only one case. Buprenorphine was detected in 18 cases, methadone in 5 cases and benzodiazepines in 4 cases. Urine ethanol was positive in 50 cases. We found only one case with 6-monoacetylmorphine. Other positive opiates were metabolites of antitussives. The relatively low number of benzodiazepine positive urines could be explained by the lack of sensitivity of the test we used. All these results confirm those of the previous study for cannabinoids and ethanol in safety/security workstations. Positive results for methadone and buprenorphine are eight times higher than in the general population. In conclusion, the authors think that it will be of a great interest to test urine of truck drivers for other classes of psychoactive drugs, using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method.",

Recently, it has been shown that the effects of ethanol on nicotine discrimination are not correlated with blood ethanol levels. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether ethanol (0.5-2g/kg, i.p.) could block nicotine-induced seizures in C57BL/6J mice and to correlate ethanol's actions with blood ethanol concentrations. For comparison, the effects of a gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptor positive modulator, midazolam (0.25-40 mg/kg, i.p.), and a gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor agonist, baclofen (2.5-20 mg/kg, i.p.), were assessed in the same procedure. Nicotine (3-9 mg/kg, s.c.) induced clonic-tonic seizures in a dose-dependent manner. Ethanol, administered 5 or 50 min before nicotine, dose dependently antagonized seizures elicited by 6 mg/kg nicotine. The anticonvulsant effects of ethanol correlated with blood ethanol levels and were comparable to those exerted by midazolam. Baclofen antagonized only the tonic component of nicotine-induced convulsions. The anticonvulsant doses of ethanol (0.5-2 g/kg), midazolam (0.5-1 mg/kg), and baclofen (5-10 mg/kg) did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity in a control experiment. The present results indicate that (i) ethanol may block nicotine-induced seizures in mice at doses that do not alter locomotor activity and (ii) the anti-seizure effects of ethanol depend on blood ethanol levels and are comparable to those exerted by the GABAA positive modulator midazolam.", 
    "153": "Ketamine's role in clinical anaesthesia is developing as a result of the evolving concepts of its mechanism of action and the advantages of its alternative routes of administration. In this study, we aimed to investigate the frequency and severity of adverse effects, specifically emergence phenomena and vomiting, when ketamine with or without midazolam used as a sole anaesthetic.", 
    "154": "One hundred children, aged between 3 and 10 years, scheduled for adenotonsillectomy were studied. Fifty ASA physical status I-II patients were administered ketamine and atropine intramuscularly (group K, n=50). The remaining 50 children were given ketamine, atropine and midazolam by as the same route (group KM, n=50). Noninvasive hemodynamic and oxygenation variables were monitored. Operative conditions and recovery profiles such as hallucinations, nightmares, awakening by crying agitation and retching-vomiting were investigated in 1st, 2nd, 15th, 30th and 60th days after the operation.", 
    "155": "A significant reduction in emergence reactions was demonstrated especially in group KM during the early postoperative period (p<0.05). Retching-vomiting also reduced significantly in the group KM during the same time (p<0.05).", 
    "156": "As a sole anaesthetic ketamine with or without midazolam provided a calm and safe anaesthesia for paediatric patients in short term procedures. In addition, it must be noted that, a better postoperative early period was achieved by ketamine with midazolam.", 
    "157": "The hypothesis that kainate receptor blockade would be associated with anxiolytic-like effects was tested with a selective ligand, 3S,4aR,6S,8aR-6-((4-carboxyphenyl)methyl)-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY382884). LY382884 selectively binds the GLU(K5) kainate receptor subunit (K(b)=0.6 microM) and has 30 microM or greater affinity for cloned human AMPA receptor subtypes. The anxiolytic potential of LY382884 was tested in rats responding under a Vogel conflict procedure, a pharmacologically validated model for the prediction of antianxiety efficacy in humans. Both the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide and LY382884 increased suppressed licking without affecting rates of non-suppressed licking. In contrast, an AMPA receptor selective antagonist, 7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine-7-carboxamide, 5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-N,8-dimethyl-, monohydrochloride (9CI) (GYKI53655), did not increase suppressed responding. The finding that a selective GLU(K5) receptor antagonist produced anxiolytic-like effects in an animal model predictive of efficacy in humans combined with data in the literature on glutamatergic modulation of anxiety suggests that kainate receptor sensitivity to glutamate might be an important mediating event in the pathophysiological expression of anxiety states. The selective targeting of kainate receptors with an antagonist could therefore be a novel pharmacological mechanism to treat anxiety disorders.",

    "159": "We performed a cross-sectional study of 2,195 men and 2,247 women, 33 to 69 year old (DESIR. cohort) recording responses to a self-administered \"sleep\" questionnaire and a general questionnaire including socio-economic characteristics and lifestyle factors.", 
    "160": "The prevalence of symptoms in men and women were respectively: snoring frequently (28%, 14%), frequent daytime sleepiness (14%, 18%) and frequent apnoeas (5%, 2%). Overall, 8.5% of men and 6.3% of women reported a pattern of symptoms suggestive of OSA, as they snored and had daytime sleepiness and/or apnoeas. This pattern was associated, for both sexes, with age, body mass index and after adjustment on these two factors, to a mediocre self-reported health status and treatment with benzodiazepines or other sedatives. For men only, the OSA pattern of symptoms was also associated with, hypertension, alcohol consumption and smoking.", 
    "161": "Snoring, daytime hypersomnolence and witnessed apnoeas are symptoms frequently observed in the general population. Subjects with a combination of these abnormalities suggesting a high probability of sleep apnoea syndrome and in whom a sleep study is warranted represent 7.5% of the adult population.", 
    "162": "We report the concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood samples from people arrested in Sweden for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). The investigation covered a 2 year period 2004 (N = 7052 cases) and 2005 (N = 7759 cases) and was prompted by recent legislation stipulating zero-concentration limits in blood for controlled substances. However, prescription drugs are exempt from the zero-limit law provided that the medication was being used in accordance with a doctor's prescription. The blood concentrations of various psychoactive substances were compared with the limits of quantitation of the analytic method used and the so-called therapeutic concentration range according to various reference books and tabulations. Diazepam [N = 1950 (26%)] and nordazepam [N = 2168 (28%)] were the therapeutic agents most frequently identified in these forensic blood samples along with other benzodiazepines such as alprazolam [N = 430 (5.6%)], flunitrazepam [N = 308 (4.0%)], and nitrazepam [N = 222 (2.9%)]. The newer hypnotics, exemplified by zolpidem [N = 148 (1.9%)] and zopiclone [N = 111 (1.5%)], were also high on the list of psychoactive substances identified. Interpreting the concentration of a prescription drug in blood in relation to whether the person had taken an overdose or was abusing the substance in question is not always easy. The age, gender, degree of obesity, and ethnicity of the person concerned; the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug; polymorphism of drug-metabolizing enzymes as well as liver and kidney function and blood hematocrit need to be considered. Among preanalytic factors, stability of the drug in blood after sampling, the type of tubes and preservatives used, the dosage form and route of administration deserve consideration. When therapeutic drug monitoring concentrations are compared with forensic toxicology results, then the plasma-to-whole blood distribution ratio of the drug also needs to be considered. In blood samples from DUID suspects, the concentrations of many commonly used sedatives and hypnotics exceeded the accepted therapeutic limits, which gives an indication of the abuse potential of these types of medications.",

    "164": "Sixty-eight ASA I-II children undergoing circumcision were randomized into three groups to receive different oral premedication given 30 min before anaesthesia: midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1, clonidine 2 microg kg-1, and clonidine 4 microg kg-1. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was administered via a facemask (O2/N2O: 40/60). Analgesia was with penile block (bupivacaine 0.5% 0.3 ml kg-1) and rectal paracetamol (30 mg kg-1). During the first postoperative hour, children were evaluated using a modified 'objective pain scale'.", 
    "165": "Only the 4 microg kg-1 dose of clonidine was associated with a significant reduction in emergence agitation. Fewer children in the clonidine 4 microg kg-1 group displayed agitation (25%) than in the midazolam group (60%) (P=0.025). Incidence of hypotension and bradycardia, time to first micturition and first drink did not differ among groups.",

From September 2005 to March 2006, 80 patients scheduled for regular outpatient follow-up cystoscopy participated in this study. The patients were randomized and classified according to the cystoscope type and midazolam use as follows: group 1 (10 men and 10 women), flexible cystoscopy + midazolam; group 2 (10 men and 10 women), flexible cystoscopy + no midazolam; group 3 (10 men and 10 women), rigid cystoscopy + midazolam; and group 4 (10 men and 10 women), rigid cystoscopy + no midazolam. Immediately after the procedure, the patients were asked to rate their comfort level using a ten-point visual linear analog self-assessment pain scale. The patients assigned in the midazolam group experienced no side-effects from the midazolam. Blood pressure and pulse rate did not change significantly during the procedure. The degree of pain experienced by group 1 was lower than other groups (P < 0.05) and group 4 had a significantly greater pain score than other groups (P < 0.05). No difference was evident between group 2 and 3 regarding the pain score. Midazolam anesthesia may relieve pain during rigid and flexible cystoscopy. Our findings suggest that midazolam anesthesia during cystoscopy is useful and safe.",

This effect was comparable to that of atypical antipsychotic olanzapine in near-therapeutic doses (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and was blocked with nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Radioreceptor assay showed that selank did not displace nonselective D2-dopamine receptor antagonist (3)H-spiperone (EC50>100 microM) and delta- and micro-opioid receptor ligand 3H-DADLE (EC50>40 microM) from specific binding sites on rat brain membranes. It is hypothesized that the revealed behavioral effect of selank is mediated by its modulating effect on the endogenous opioid system and specifically, by its effect on activity of enkephalin-degrading enzymes.",

Pharmacokinetic assessments were made at baseline and at the end of treatment weeks 4 and 8 at topiramate dosages of 100 and 200 mg/d, respectively.", 
    "171": "Plasma concentrations of clozapine and its metabolite (norclozapine), olanzapine, risperidone and its metabolite (9-hydroxy-risperidone), and quetiapine were not significantly modified during concomitant administration of topiramate. Adjunctive topiramate therapy was well tolerated in all groups.",

    "173": "To describe the spectrum of clinical effects in olanzapine overdose and investigate the factors that predict severe outcomes. We analysed olanzapine-overdose events confirmed by drug analysis. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were recorded for each presentation. The relationship between dose and therapeutic olanzapine use, and outcomes (length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, Glasgow coma score <9 and delirium) were investigated. Thirty-seven olanzapine overdose admissions were included. Median age was 30 years (interquartile range: 24-40 years), 24 women and 27 taking olanzapine therapeutically. Median ingested dose was 150 mg (range: 10-1600 mg). Olanzapine overdose was characterized by tachycardia (73%), central nervous system depression (43%), miosis (39%) and delirium (54%), which were either present on admission or developed within 6 h. There was no relationship between the dose and length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, Glasgow coma score <9 or delirium, but there was a trend towards more severe outcomes in patients not taking olanzapine therapeutically. Patients with delirium had an increased length of hospital stay and intensive care unit admission rate (50%) and 70% of them required physical or chemical restraint. Olanzapine overdose causes a high rate of delirium and central nervous system sedation that requires significant inpatient resources. Olanzapine overdoses should be initially observed for 6 h and patients not taking olanzapine regularly may have more severe effects.", 
    "174": "Atypical antipsychotics are often addressed as one class of drugs, although there are marked differences in their pharmacological profiles. It is unknown how this is seen by practitioners and to what extent they differentiate between the various atypical compounds. In a drug utilization study, 472 schizophrenic outpatients who were switched for individual reasons from either olanzapine or risperidone to amisulpride were monitored. Data on patients, illness and treatment as well as on reasons to switch were collected. The reasons to switch from olanzapine to amisulpride were preferably 'weight gain' (72.6% of the physicians), or the 'expectancy of less weight gain with amisulpride' (84.1%) and 'patient request' (60.2%). Specific reasons to switch from risperidone were 'extrapyramidal symptoms' (58.5%), or the 'expectancy of few extrapyramidal symptoms with amisulpride' (82.5%). In conclusion, this study confirms that physicians do not consider 'atypical antipsychotics' as one homogeneous class of drugs but make differences that reflect the specific pharmacological profiles of the respective drugs.", 
    "175": "The use of certain atypical antipsychotics has been associated with metabolic disturbances. We have assessed the evolution of body weight and glycaemia during a 6-month randomized comparative trial of amisulpride and olanzapine. Three hundred and seventy-seven adult patients with schizophrenia were randomized to either amisulpride (200-800 mg/day) or olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) for 6 months. Body weight and fasting blood glucose were measured. Both treatments showed comparable antipsychotic activity. Weight gain over the study was significantly greater (P=0.0004) in the olanzapine group (3.9+/-5.3 kg) than in the amisulpride group (1.6+/-4.9 kg). Mean fasting blood glucose increased in the olanzapine group by 4.42 mg/dl to a mean maximum value (118+/-38 mg/dl). In the amisulpride group, mean glucose levels fell by 2.82 mg/dl. The difference between groups was significant at 2 (P=0.0066) and 6 months (P=0.017). One olanzapine-treated patient was diagnosed with diabetes. Metabolic changes in the amisulpride group were restricted to patients with high body mass index at inclusion. At doses that provide comparable control of psychosis, treatment with olanzapine was associated with greater increase in weight and blood glucose compared with amisulpride. This should be taken into account in assessing risk-benefit of treatment options in schizophrenia.",

This bilingual (English and French), multi-center, randomized validation study was conducted in 47 primary care settings in four provinces of Canada. Patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text-Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a major depressive episode, in the context of a major depressive disorder (N=454) were enrolled. Eligible patients received open-label, flexible-dose antidepressant treatment. The analysis reported here was limited to patients whose depression severity was evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) (n=205). Patients completing 8 weeks of open-label antidepressant treatment (n=157) were considered evaluable. As a proxy for anxiety symptoms, scores on 6 items from the HAMD-17 (psychological anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, hypochondriasis, and insight into illness) were summed to arrive at a composite anxiety score, which was then used to calculate an anxiety ratio (with the composite anxiety score as the numerator and the total HAMD-17 score as the denominator).",

After 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy, remitting patients evinced a statistically significant decrease in anxiety ratio (p=0.041). Moreover, an inverse correlation was noted between severity of anxious symptoms at endpoint and probability of remission (p=0.026). The burden of anxiety, presented as the anxiety ratio, was higher in non-remitting patients at endpoint (p=0.828).",

Sixteen children who were 8-17 years of age and met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were admitted into a 10-week, open-label, optimizing dose study of olanzapine. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity/Improvement scales were used to assess improvement during the study. Of the 16 subjects who completed the study, 12 demonstrated significant improvement on end of treatment BPRS, CGI, and PANSS scores compared with baseline. Male subjects showed greater improvement and also gained more weight. Weight gain occurred in all but 2 subjects. Weight gain was significant, with patients averaging a gain of about 6.2 kg during the 6-week course of the study. Two of the subjects experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. The average dose of olanzapine for all subjects was 0.17 mg/kg.",

A nationally representative patient-level database comprising of pharmacy and medical claims was used to identify patients with depression (ICD-9-CM: 296.2, 296.3, 300.4, 311), who had initiated therapy with bupropion sustained release (b.i.d.; 2 doses/d) or extended release (q.d.; 1 dose/d) tablets from September 2003 to February 2004; had no previous antidepressant or benzodiazepine use; and had 9 months of follow-up. Persistence was measured using prescription claims, and calculated using the medication possession ratio [MPR; (total days supply; all filled prescriptions)/270 d]. Multivariate logistic regression compared the likelihood of achieving MPR > or = 0.70 controlling for age, sex, and index date. A total of 3132 patients were included (b.i.d.: n = 2382; q.d.: n = 756). q.d. patients on average had a significantly higher MPR than b.i.d. patients [q.d. 0.52 (+/-0.35), b.i.d. 0.35 (+/-0.26)]; P < 0.001) and had a higher likelihood of achieving an MPR > or = 0.70 (q.d. 35%, b.i.d. 12%, P < 0.0001). After controlling for differences in baseline characteristics, b.i.d. patients were only one-fourth as likely (odds ratio = 0.260, 95% confidence interval: 0.214-0.316) to achieve MPR >0.7. The use of the once-daily, extended release formulation of bupropion appeared to significantly improve patients' persistence to therapy for the treatment of depression.",

The sample comprised 123 drug misusers who were dependent upon opiates only or who were codependent upon opiates and benzodiazepines. Drug misusers dependent upon methadone doses up to 70 mg were eligible for the study. Detoxification took place within a specialist inpatient drug-dependence unit. Withdrawal symptom severity was assessed on a daily basis by means of the Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale. Outcome was assessed for reductions in severity of withdrawal symptoms, treatment retention, and treatment completion. Buprenorphine detoxification was associated with less severe opiate withdrawal symptoms than methadone. Opiate/Benzodiazepine codependent patients reported less severe withdrawal symptoms during treatment with buprenorphine than with methadone and were also more likely to complete detoxification when treated with buprenorphine.",

The various tasks of the RT test allowed calculation of SA and AA. Standard AD evaluation tests were performed at baseline and after 22 weeks.", 
    "185": "After 8 and 22 weeks of treatment, an improvement of decision time and RT at all complexity levels was noted. For movement time, improvements were less pronounced and not present at both follow-up moments or at all complexity levels. Selective attention, but not AA, improved significantly after 22 weeks. A decrease in the number of errors was noted. At several complexity levels, both at 8 and 22 weeks, the interindividual and intraindividual variability decreased. Changes in Mini Mental State Evaluation score were correlated with those in SA.",

In total, 301 patients experiencing acute agitation were randomized to IM aripiprazole 9.75 mg per injection (n = 78), IM aripiprazole 15 mg per injection (n = 78), IM lorazepam 2 mg per injection (n = 70), or IM placebo (n = 75) in this double-blind multicenter study. Patients could receive up to 3 injections over 24 hours. Primary efficacy measure was mean change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component score from baseline at 2 hours after first injection. Mean improvements in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component score at 2 hours were significantly greater with IM aripiprazole (9.75 mg, -8.7; 15 mg, -8.7) and IM lorazepam (-9.6) versus IM placebo (-5.8; P <or= 0.001). For all other efficacy measures, all 3 active treatments showed significantly greater improvements over IM placebo at 2 hours (P < 0.05), with similar improvements across the active treatments. Significant differences over IM placebo were seen by 45 to 60 minutes for several efficacy parameters. Both IM aripiprazole doses were well tolerated; the safety profile was similar to oral aripiprazole. Oversedation (Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale score of 8 or 9) during 2 hours after first injection was less frequent with IM aripiprazole 9.75 mg (6.7%) and IM placebo (6.8%) versus IM aripiprazole 15 mg (17.3%) and IM lorazepam (19.1%). IM aripiprazole 9.75 and 15 mg are effective and well tolerated for acute agitation in bipolar disorder, although the low incidence of oversedation suggests a risk-benefit profile for IM aripiprazole 9.75 mg.", 
    "188": "Recent data suggest that inhibitory pathways may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and in the mode of action of some antidepressant interventions. The aim of the present study was to test whether vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can affect motor cortex excitability. Measures of motor cortical excitability were probed by using single-pulse and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation at baseline, after 10 weeks of left VNS, and additionally, in an on-off paradigm in 10 patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression. Ten weeks of VNS was associated with a selective and pronounced increase in intracortical inhibition, whereas no changes occurred in the on-off paradigm. These results suggest that VNS is capable of changing motor cortical excitability in patients with depression.", 
    "189": "Data from a published double-blind randomized trial comparing olanzapine versus haloperidol in acute mania were used to address the response and tolerability of Latin American patients. Primary efficacy end point was the remission rate (Young Mania Rating Scale score <or=12 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of <or=8). Patients were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. The mean modal doses (milligrams per day) were similar in Latin American (OL) (14.2; n = 51) and white (OC) (15.1; n = 120) patients treated with olanzapine, and in Latin American (HL) (7.1; n = 48) and white (HC) (8.5; n = 113) patients treated with haloperidol. At week 6, remission rates were similar among the OL and HL patients (64.7% vs. 68.8%) but were higher in the OC than in HC (49.2% vs. 32.7%; P = 0.012). Significantly more HL than OL patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia and tremor. Tremor was significantly higher in HL than in HC patients, whereas a significant increase in the Barnes Akathisia Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores was observed in HC versus HL. Somnolence and weight gain were significantly higher in OL than in OC patients, and more OL and OC patients experienced weight gain in comparison with the HL and HC groups, respectively. The incidence of nonfasting glucose levels above normal levels did not statistically differ between groups. In conclusion, in contrast to our findings among white patients, the Latin American patients who have acute mania did not differ in overall response to olanzapine or haloperidol. The pattern of adverse events differed between treatment groups. Prospective clinical trials in Latin American bipolar populations are justified."
