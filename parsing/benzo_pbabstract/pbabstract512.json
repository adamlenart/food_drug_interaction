    "0": "In a series of four experiments the benzodiazepine triazolam was tested for reinforcing effects and for effects on reinforcement induced by amphetamine and morphine. Reinforcement was assessed in a conditioned place preference paradigm. Triazolam did not produce reinforcing or aversive effects when administered in doses ranging from 0.0625 to 0.5 mg/kg. Triazolam did attenuate reinforcing effects produced by 0.75 and 1.25 mg/kg amphetamine. No effect of triazolam was observed on morphine-induced reinforcement. These results indicate that the administration of triazolam can affect the brain mechanisms that mediate the reinforcing effects of amphetamine but not morphine.", 
    "1": "The interoceptive stimulus produced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) is pharmacologically similar to anxiety and is used in a behavioral assay for anxiety-related stimuli (the PTZ model of anxiety). The stimulus fading technique was tested as a method to increase the sensitivity of this assay. Rats were trained with food-reward to press one lever after injection of PTZ and an alternate lever after saline. Rats initially learned the discrimination at a PTZ dose of 20 mg/kg. They were then trained with sequentially lower doses until they reliably discriminated a PTZ dose of 10 mg/kg. Substitution tests with other doses and drugs showed that, after the fading procedure, dose-response curves were shifted to lower doses for PTZ, Ro 5-3663, and nicotine Similarly, the dose of diazepam required to block the low dose of PTZ was lower than that required to block the higher dose of PTZ. These results indicated that the sensitivity of the discrimination was enhanced in rats trained to discriminate a lower dose of PTZ. Doses of nikethamide, cocaine, and yohimbine that did not substitute for the higher dose of PTZ also did not substitute for the lower dose. These data suggest that rats can be trained to discriminate a low dose of PTZ by the stimulus fading technique. Moreover, they suggest that this training method does not compromise the specificity of the discrimination.", 
    "2": "In previous studies no correlation between blood concentration and toxicity was found in acute chlordiazepoxide overdose. We describe a case of acute overdosage with 5.2 g chlordiazepoxide, in which toxicity correlated to blood concentration of the second metabolite of chlordiazepoxide, to demoxepam. Therefore, it is recommended to determine not only chlordiazepoxide, but also its active metabolites in cases of overdose. This can easily been achieved using the described method, HPLC with photodiode array detection.", 
    "3": "In order to investigate possible neurobiologic mechanisms underlying carbon dioxide-induced anxiety, the effects of oral alprazolam 0.75 mg and intravenous clonidine 2 mcg/kg on CO2-induced increases in ratings of subjective anxiety, pulse rate, and ventilation were measured in healthy human subjects. Pretreatment with alprazolam but not with clonidine significantly reduced the CO2-induced increase in ratings of anxiety. Neither drug altered CO2-induced increases in pulse rate or ventilatory responses. Clonidine did produce potent sedative and hypotensive effects. The behavioral data suggest that the mechanisms through which CO2 induces anxiety-like effects involve neural systems regulated by benzodiazepine receptors and, secondly, that they appear not to require normal functioning of noradrenergic systems. Carbon dioxide may provide a useful model system for identification of new drugs with anxiolytic properties.", 
    "4": "When injected IP, the M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine dose-dependently induced a deficit in passive avoidance learning in rats. This activity was optimal at 75 mg/kg injected 1 h before the acquisition session. The deficit induced by pirenzepine was antagonized by oxotremorine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg SC) and physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg SC), but not neostigmine. By comparison, under the same experimental conditions, physostigmine and oxotremorine also antagonized the deficit induced by an equipotent dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg IP), although the activity of physostigmine appeared stronger against scopolamine than against pirenzepine. These results suggest that pirenzepine could produce a centrally-mediated behavioural disruption when injected systemically.", 
    "5": "After 7 day's gradual introduction of ethanol, rats were maintained for a further 4 weeks on a liquid diet containing 10% ethanol (mean daily dose 11.8 +/- 0.2 g/kg/day). Control-treated rats received liquid diet alone. Pairs of rats were tested in the social interaction test of anxiety 8 h after withdrawal. Withdrawal from ethanol significantly reduced the time spent in social interaction compared with controls, indicating an anxiogenic withdrawal response. Nitrendipine (50 mg/kg) had no effect on, whereas flumazenil (4 mg/kg) significantly reversed, this withdrawal response. This reversal appeared to be long-lasting as there was still no evidence of increased anxiety when rats were again withdrawn after 3 more days of ethanol diet.", 
    "6": "The effects of various oral doses (1, 2, 4 mg) of flunitrazepam on vigilance, attention, immediate memory, short-term memory, learning, non-consolidated and consolidated long-term memory were determined. Twelve healthy young male volunteers were given placebo or flunitrazepam in a double-blind, random latin-square sequence, crossing over every 2 weeks. Volunteers completed a battery of tests at night, 3.5 h after drug administration, and in the morning, 10 h after drug administration. Flunitrazepam 1 mg did not significantly impair any of the functions tested at night, while 4 mg impaired vigilance, attention, immediate memory, short-term verbal memory and learning. The impairments of immediate and short-term memory seem to be related and proportional to reductions in vigilance and attention. Doses of 2 mg and 4 mg impaired the speed of learning but did not decrease the amount of material learned. Flunitrazepam caused dose-related impairment of long-term memory, both consolidated and not. This reduction of long-term memory does not seem to be related to the impairments of vigilance, attention or learning. The lowest dose did not modify vigilance and learning in any subject, improved attention in half of the subjects but reduced long-term memory in a similar number of subjects. Therefore, our results indicate selective impairment of long-term memory. Since there were no differences between the effects on consolidated and non-consolidated memory, the amnesic effect of flunitrazepam seems to be due to a decrease in the storage of memory traces. There were no clear generalized residual effects in the morning after administration.", 
    "7": "Among animals from the same cage, mice removed last had a higher temperature compared to those removed first. This phenomenon a) persisted 2 and 24 h later; b) was present regardless of the number of the animals (5, 10, 15 and 20) in each cage, c) was independent of whether the number of animals was reduced or maintained constant in the cage and d) could even be observed by reversing the order of removal of the animals from the cage. In addition, the fewer the animals allocated to a cage the greater the percentage of those which became hyperthermic. This rise in rectal temperature of mice removed last was prevented by diazepam (2.5 and 5 mg/kg PO, 30 min), nitrazepam (2 and 4 mg/kg PO, 30 min) but not by imipramine (15 and 30 mg/kg PO, 60 min) or haloperidol (0.5 and 1 mg/kg PO, 60 min) and was observed in a greater percentage of mice following subcutaneous yohimbine treatment (2 mg/kg, 60 min). This phenomenon does not seem to depend on physical exercise due to an attempt to escape, since no correlation appears to exist between motor activity (open-field) and rise in rectal temperature. These data would seem to indicate that hyperthermia in the last animals may represent a new tool for studying the neurobiology of anticipatory(?) anxiety.", 
    "8": "An experimental study on 34 healthy male volunteers demonstrated that a therapeutic dose of diazepam (15 mg PO) influenced the reproduction of a conditioned emotional response (skin conductance activity) on subsequent test days. This effect depended upon the pharmacological state present at acquisition, and was in accordance with a drug-dissociation interpretation of diazepam's amnesic effect. The results are interpreted as an example of diazepam state-dependency effects upon development of behavioral tolerance to stress. The clinical consequence of the results indicates that patients under diazepam medication will to a certain degree be deprived of the ability to develop appropriate coping strategies. It is concluded that combining psychotherapy with diazepam treatment may have the opposite effects to those intended.", 
    "9": "In the first of two experiments, young male cardiomyopathic hamsters were injected intraperitoneally twice a day for 29 days with 8 mg alprazolam/kg body weight or saline. Three hours after the same injections on day 30, they were sacrificed and plasma hormone levels were measured. Alprazolam increased cortisol, total glucocorticoid and triiodothyronine levels. It did not affect corticosterone, thyroxine or testosterone levels. The same protocol was used in a second experiment, except the controls received vehicle and a third group was treated with 48 mg diazepam/kg body weight. Alprazolam again increased cortisol and total glucocorticoid levels, but not those of corticosterone. On the other hand, diazepam increased both cortisol and corticosterone levels. These experiments suggest that chronic benzodiazepine treatment can affect adrenocortical function and perhaps some aspects of thyroid function.", 
    "10": "Selective breeding was used to produce lines of mice which differ markedly in their genetically-mediated vulnerability to handling-induced convulsions (HIC) associated with the ethanol withdrawal syndrome. These are known as the ethanol withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) and withdrawal seizure resistant (WSR) selection lines. As a result of 5 generations of selective breeding with ethanol, a 3.4-fold difference between WSP and WSR mice was seen in HIC associated with ethanol withdrawal. When diazepam was used as the dependence-producing drug, a 2.4-fold difference emerged. After 6 more generations of selective breeding with ethanol, an approximate 10-fold difference was seen with ethanol, while with diazepam, this difference in HIC scores was also about 10-fold. This close parallel between ethanol and diazepam indicates that physical dependence on both drugs, as indexed by handling-induced convulsions, is extensively codetermined by the same genes, and thus by the same mechanisms, in these selectively-bred mice.", 
    "11": "Rat cerebral cortex was used to prepare a suspension of benzodiazepine receptors. The suspension was mixed with an extract of specimen and [3H]flunitrazepam. The mixture was filtered through a membrane, and radioactivity on the membrane was measured. Clonazepam concentrations in patient plasma specimens determined by radioreceptor assay and gas-liquid chromatography agreed well. However, diazepam equivalent concentrations determined by radioreceptor assay were close to the sum of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, as desmethyldiazepam had binding activity for the receptor. This receptor assay method is accurate, simple, requires less than 0.5 ml of plasma, and is therefore suitable for analyzing numerous samples in a short time.",

    "14": "Food intake of four adult male baboons (Papio c. anubis) was monitored during daily experimental sessions lasting 22 h. Food was available under a two-component operant schedule. Following completion of the first \"procurement component\" response requirement, access to food, i.e., a meal, became available under the second \"consumption component\" during which each response produced a 1-g food pellet. After a 10-min interval in which no response occurred, the consumption component was terminated. The effects of diazepam (DZP: 0.12-4.0 mg/kg) were determined by having the baboons drink a dose on Tuesdays and Fridays 45-60 min before the daily session. DZP produced dose-dependent increases in food intake in three of the four baboons. DZP increased the size of the first two meals and total duration of eating, but had no effect on eating rate or the number of meals within a session. The effect of DZP on the topography of feeding of baboons differs from previous reports on the effects of benzodiazepines on the topography of feeding in rodents. This suggests that species or procedural differences influence the effects of DZP on food intake.", 
    "15": "In this study we examined the effects of lorazepam (2.0 mg PO) plus either placebo or one of three doses of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (0.3 mg, 1.0 mg or 3.0 mg IV) on measures of memory, attention and sedation. We found that lorazepam impaired verbal secondary memory performance, but also produced subjective and objective sedation; it increased reaction time, reduced critical flicker fusion thresholds and caused subjects to make more errors on a sustained attention task and rate themselves as drowsy. Ro 15-1788 dose dependently blocked the deficit in secondary memory produced by lorazepam, but also showed monotonic dose-related antagonism of its effects on indices of sedation (with the exception of the critical flicker fusion deficit, which was unaffected). These results demonstrate that lorazepam-induced cognitive deficits can be blocked by a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. They also suggest that the memory deficits produced in this pharmacological model of organic amnesia are not readily dissociated from deficits in attention.", 
    "16": "Antidepressant-induced anti-immobility effects have been assessed in animals exposed or not to a pretest session using the forced swimming test. Desipramine, maprotiline, mianserine (15 and 30 mg/kg), nomifensine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (1 and 2 mg/kg) and muscimol (1 and 2 mg/kg), unlike imipramine (15 and 30 mg/kg), LY-171555 (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg), did not reduce immobility time in rats which had not received the pretest session. On the other hand, all of the drugs tested reduced immobility time in rats exposed to a pretest session. In addition, the degree of antiimmobility effects of desipramine (20 mg/kg) and nomifensine (5 mg/kg) increased proportionally with the level of water (0, 4, 15 and 30 cm) to which animals were exposed at the time of pretest. Furthermore, desipramine reduced immobility time in rats pre-exposed to types of stress different from forced swimming, cold, restraint or foot-shock. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally three times, 24, 5 and 1 h before testing. The present findings suggest that a stressful pretest session may reveal pharmacological properties of antidepressants in the forced swimming test. This is also substantiated by the fact that diazepam (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) administered 30 min before the swimming pretest antagonized the anti-immobility effect of 15 mg/kg desipramine.", 
    "17": "The interaction of cholinergic agonists and antagonists with smooth muscle muscarinic receptors has been investigated by measurement of displacement of the muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB (quinuclidinyl benzilate) in membranes prepared from toad stomach. The binding of [3H]QNB was saturable, reversible and of high affinity (KD = 423 pM). The muscarinic receptor subtypes present in gastric smooth muscle were classified by determining the relative affinities for the selective antagonists pirenzepine (M1), AF-DX 116 (M2) and 4-DAMP (M3). The results from these studies indicate the presence of a heterogeneous population of muscarinic receptor subtypes, with a majority (88%) exhibiting characteristics of M3 receptors and a much smaller population (12%) exhibiting characteristics of M2 receptors. The binding curve for the displacement of [3H]QNB binding by the agonist oxotremorine was complex and was consistent with presence of two affinity states: 24% of the receptors had a high affinity (KD = 4.7 nM) for oxotremorine and 76% displayed nearly a 1,000-fold lower affinity (KD = 4.4 microM). When oxotremorine displacement of [3H]QNB binding was determined in the presence GTP gamma S, high affinity binding was abolished, indicating that high affinity agonist binding may represent receptors coupled to G proteins. Moreover, pertussis toxin pretreatment of membranes also abolished high affinity agonist binding, indicating that the muscarinic receptors are coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Reaction of smooth muscle membranes with pertussis toxin in the presence [32P]NAD caused the [32P]-labelling of a 40 dD protein that may represent the alpha subunit(s) of G proteins that are known to by NAD-ribosylated by the toxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Rats were chronically treated with chlordiazepoxide (CDP 10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 27 days. Twenty-four hours after their last dose, they received flumazenil (4 mg/kg) or vehicle and were tested in the social interaction test, in a low-light, familiar arena. CDP withdrawal significantly reduced the time spent in social interaction compared with controls, indicating an anxiogenic withdrawal response. This was completely reversed by flumazenil. A second group received CDP for 27 days and, in addition, received a single dose of flumazenil (4 mg/kg) 6 days before testing. Flumazenil prevented the development of the anxiogenic withdrawal response in these rats.", 
    "19": "We studied the effects of butoctamide hydrogen succinate and nitrazepam on psychomotor function and EEG in eight male volunteers aged 19-32. The hypnotic effects, effects on psychomotor performance, EEG activity and standing steadiness between BAHS 1000 mg and nitrazepam 5 mg were compared at regular intervals for 10 h. The serum levels of both drugs were also assayed. The hypnotic effects of BAHS were very weak compared to those of nitrazepam. BAHS did not exert any effects on psychomotor performance and standing steadiness during the test period. In contrast, nitrazepam impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness as the serum drug levels increased. Nitrazepam decreased the alpha activity and increased the beta activity in a concentration-dependent manner. BAHS did not change the alpha activity but increased beta-2 activity at Fz and Cz at 10 h of the post-drug period. BAHS was eliminated more rapidly than nitrazepam. These results indicated that BAHS, at the dose used, was less potent than nitrazepam and the effects on psychomotor performance and standing steadiness were minimal.", 
    "20": "Three research groups have provided evidence that benzodiazepines might be also of natural origin. In the brain of different species including humans and in several plant products, desmethyldiazepam and diazepam are detectable by immunological methods and gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. Thus, benzodiazepines represent natural drugs which may be incorporated into animals and humans through plant products. Whether the measured low concentrations (ranging from 0.01 up to 600 ng/g wet weight) have any biological role or clinical significance remains to be determined.", 
    "21": "The differing actions of phenytoin, carbamazepine and sodium valproate on growth hormone release were studied in 20 patients with recently diagnosed epilepsy using diazepam, clonidine and glucagon as stimulatory tests of growth hormone response. The results are compared with the growth hormone response obtained pre treatment, and those from 20 control patients and 11 patients with chronic treated epilepsy. There was a reduction in growth hormone response to diazepam in both treated and untreated patients with epilepsy compared to controls. Treatment with phenytoin resulted in a significant increase in growth hormone release after diazepam and glucagon, whilst sodium valproate reduced the growth hormone response to diazepam.", 
    "22": "In a double-blind, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated in patients after gastroscopy under midazolam or diazepam sedation. The criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation and anterograde amnesia. Flumazenil significantly reduced the degree of sedation in both groups without significant intergroup differences. No sign of resedation was found during the observation period of 3 h. The anterograde amnesia was effectively antagonized in both groups. Flumazenil was well tolerated. Flumazenil is a safe and effective benzodiazepine antagonist which makes it possible to reduce the recovery period in outpatients sedated sufficiently with benzodiazepines for gastroscopy.", 
    "23": "Rats were trained to respond under 3-min fixed-interval schedules of food presentation, and effects of the benzodiazepine-receptor ligands, flumazenil, 2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 9895), 3-carbo-t-butoxy-beta-carboline (beta-CCtB), and beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) were assessed before and after the induction of tolerance to chlordiazepoxide. Before daily administration of chlordiazepoxide, none of the antagonists produced appreciable effects on rates of responding up to doses of 32.0 mg/kg i.p. beta-CCE was the only antagonist studied at a higher dose (100.0 mg/kg i.p.), which decreased response rates. After 23 days of daily chlordiazepoxide administration (oral doses started at 10 and increased to 100 mg/kg/day by the 17th day), dose-effect curves for chlordiazepoxide were shifted to the right by about one-half log unit. Subjects were also more sensitive to the flumazenil, CGS 9895, and beta-CCtB, however, since these drugs produced only small effects in non-tolerant subjects, precise estimates of the degree of the shift in dose-effect curves could not be estimated. However, there were differences in the changes in the dose-effect curves induced by chlordiazepoxide tolerance. These results suggest differences in mechanism of action of antagonists in tolerant and non-tolerant subjects, and further that the sensitivity that is induced to antagonists in tolerant subjects is not conferred equally to all drugs having benzodiazepine antagonist activity.", 
    "24": "A patient with portal-systemic encephalopathy refractory to standard therapy (40-g protein diet, oral neomycin and lactulose, supplementation of diet with branched chain amino acids) following extensive liver resection and construction of a portacaval shunt was treated with 25 mg of flumazenil twice daily by mouth. Before treatment with flumazenil she was encephalopathic and experienced 12 attacks of coma within 2 yr. When treated with flumazenil all signs of encephalopathy abated in spite of an unrestricted dietary intake of protein. Two days after discontinuation of flumazenil treatment she became comatose again. She remained chronically encephalopathic and had four further episodes of coma during the subsequent 3 mo. Since reinstitution of flumazenil treatment she has been well for 14 mo during follow-up without any signs of encephalopathy while on an unrestricted protein diet. Furthermore, flumazenil therapy reversed abnormalities of recordings of multimodality evoked potentials that were associated with hepatic encephalopathy. The striking remission of encephalopathy by treatment with flumazenil suggests that this benzodiazepine antagonist may be valuable in the long-term management of portal-systemic encephalopathy.", 
    "25": "Drugs with a short elimination half-life should display fewer side effects than longer acting drugs in the treatment of sleep disturbances due to their smaller tendency to accumulate, especially in the elderly.

    "26": "Sleep disorders are becoming a major issue. Insomnia affects a substantial part of the population and may compromise individual quality of life. The principal existing hypnotic drugs, Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines are not safely. They have modes of action which results in the action of common mechanism: facilitating neurotransmission in GABAergic synapses. Stimulation of GABA receptors of the A type opens chloride ion channels which inhibits the ability of neurons to conduct nerve impulse. The clinical effects resulting which induce anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic and amnesic effects are discussed.", 
    "27": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, and somatostatin and beta-endorphin levels were measured in 12 patients with panic disorder before and after 7 months of treatment with alprazolam or imipramine. The concentrations of CSF monoamine metabolites and neuropeptides were at baseline of the same order of magnitude in panic patients and controls. Neither alprazolam nor imipramine changed metabolite or neuropeptide levels in CSF despite clinical improvement in both treatment groups. According to present CSF data, the antipanic actions of alprazolam and imipramine do not involve the monoaminergic or peptidergic systems studied.", 
    "28": "Forty-eight male Wistar rats were exposed to contingent light-shock combinations and 48 rats received light and shock stimuli in a random order. One day after fear conditioning the animals were tested for startle potentiation after injection of midazolam (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/kg, IP) or DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate; 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg IP) or lindane (0, 7.5, 15.0, 30.0 mg/kg PO). Midazolam attenuated potentiated startle dose dependently and the inverse benzodiazepine agonist DMCM had the opposite effect. The effects of lindane on startle amplitudes were identical to those of DMCM, indicating that lindane has anxiogenic effects on behavior. It is suggested that the anxiogenic effects of lindane are mediated by an effect at the GABA-ionophore complex.", 
    "29": "Eighty-one women with psychosis of schizophrenic or paranoid type participated in a double-blind comparison of melperone (300 mg daily) and thiothixene (30 mg daily). The purpose of the study was to analyse clinical and biochemical effects of the drugs. Both treatments were associated with significant reductions in psychotic morbidity. No significant difference in the clinical ratings was found between the drugs. However, there were more extrapyramidal side effects in the thiothixene as compared to the melperone group. Biochemically, the dopaminergic variables HVA in CSF and prolactin in plasma and CSF showed significantly greater elevations in the thiothixene group.", 
    "30": "A double-blind clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of pirenzepine (PZ) in acute pancreatitis (AP). One hundred and fifteen patients were randomly allocated in three groups, comparable in number, clinical and biochemical parameters. All were hydrated and received nasogastric suction. Group A was the control, groups B and C received additionally 10 and 20 mg of PZ intravenously every 12 h, respectively. PZ-treated patients showed benefit, with a significant difference (p less than 0.01) in the duration of hyperamylasemia and the duration of pain tending to be significantly reduced (p = 0.054). PZ influenced significantly (p less than 0.01) the plasma amylase levels and caused no major adverse effects. Complications were less frequent and mortality was reduced in patients who received PZ. Thus, the use of PZ in AP appears to be beneficial and safe; however, these preliminary results deserve further confirmation before a general recommendation to treat such patients can be made.", 
    "31": "1. The effects of ivermectin (IVM) and milbemycin D (MMD) on cultured embryonic spinal neurons were investigated, using the whole-cell recording technique. 2. IVM and MMD caused Cl- current under voltage-clamp conditions. 3. The reversal potential of the MMD-evoked Cl- current was shifted in a positive direction when half of the external Cl- was substituted by isethionate. 4. The MMD-evoked current was inhibited by picrotoxinin and bicuculline, whereas it was enhanced by diazepam. 5. Different characteristics of desensitization were observed between the MMD- (IVM-) and muscimol-induced effects. 6. These results suggest that IVM and MMD directly activate the Cl- channel through their specific sites modulated by GABAergic drugs.", 
    "32": "The inhibition of dansylsarcosine (DS) binding at the benzodiazepine binding site of human serum albumin has been studied in the presence of saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) of various chain lengths (C6-C20, C18:1, C18:2). In order to determine the mechanism of displacement, velocity constants for association (k2) and dissociation (k-2) and binding constants (KA and KA') have been measured using the stopped-flow method. The inhibitory effect of FFA on DS binding kinetics at site II is dependent of their structure. With increasing amounts of FFA the association velocity constant of DS binding decreases from 520 s-1 (fatty acid free albumin) by a factor of 3-10 and affinity decreases according to FFA chain length. Inhibition is strongest in the presence of caprylic, capric and lauric acid (C8-C12) i.e. with more than one mole FFA per mole albumin, DS association could no longer be measured. Short chain caproic and the long chain FFA C14-C20 showed only a less inhibitory effect since in the presence of a twofold excess k2 ranged between 100 and 200 s-1. Dissociation velocity of DS from the benzodiazepine binding site could be measured in relationship to FFA chain length using ibuprofene, another drug binding at site II. Dissociation velocity constants k-2 remained constant up to 2 moles FFA per mole albumin (k-2 = 16-18 s-1). A rise in k-2 to 70 s(-1) was seen, however, when 2-4 moles capric, lauric, myristic and palmitic (C10-C16) acid were bound, whereas no change was observed when increasing concentrations of caproic, caprylic, stearic and arachic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Drugs that bound to the peripheral-type or mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors in rat kidney mitochondria produced several effects on mitochondrial respiration with succinate and malate/pyruvate as substrates. These drugs increased state IV and decreased state III respiration rates, which resulted in a significant decrease in the respiratory control ratio. ADP: O ratios were not affected. The receptor binding affinities of a set of 10 compounds (Ro5-4864, PK11195, diazepam, mesoporphyrin IX, flunitrazepam, deuteroporphyrin IX, dipyridamole, dibutylphthalate, cyclosporin A, and CL259,763) correlated over a concentration range of almost 4 orders of magnitude with their potencies at inhibiting respiratory control (r = 0.95). The anxiolytic benzodiazepine clonazepam had no effect on mitochondrial respiratory control and bound with negligible affinity to the receptor. The magnitude of the effect of Ro5-4865 on respiration increased in parallel with the density of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors in mitochondria from liver, kidney, and adrenal. These results suggest that ligand binding to mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors results in inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory control. This effect may help to explain the pleiotropic effects of receptor ligands on intact cells.", 
    "34": "The present experiments evaluate in vivo effects of recently described cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists on rat pancreatic secretion. Pancreaticobiliary secretion was studied after bile duct cannulation in anesthetized rats. After two basal 10-min fractions were selected, secretion was stimulated by intravenous caerulein (0.1-30.0 micrograms/kg) or secretin, and collected for seven further 10-min fractions. Peptide antagonists (CR 1409, CR 1392, and CR 1505) and nonpeptide antagonists (asperlicin and L364,718) were given intravenously 10 min before agonists. Increasing doses of antagonists gradually reduced secretion of protein and enzymes stimulated by submaximal and maximal doses of caerulein. The antagonists did not alter nonstimulated or secretin-stimulated secretion, indicating their specificity for the CCK receptor. Except for proglumide and asperlicin, all antagonists were able to abolish caerulein-stimulated pancreatic secretion, as evaluated by the mean integrated 1-h response to a near-maximal dose of caerulein. The caerulein dose-response curve was gradually shifted to the right by increasing doses of CR 1409, indicating competitive-like kinetics. Inhibition of secretion due to supramaximal doses of caerulein, however, could be reversed by doses of CR 1409 smaller than expected from extrapolating truely competitive kinetics from an in vitro situation to the in vivo situation. The rank order of potency of the compounds to antagonize caerulein-stimulated secretion in vivo agreed with their relative potencies to antagonize caerulein-stimulated amylase secretion from pancreatic acini in vitro as well as with their affinity to bind to peripheral CCK receptors in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The effects of the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist L-364,718 was studied in a model of mild pancreatitis induced in mice by repeated injections of the secretagogue caerulein and in a lethal form of pancreatitis induced by feeding mice an ethionine-supplemented choline-deficient diet. L-364,718 prevented the caerulein-induced rise in serum amylase and pancreatic weight in a dose-dependent manner, the most effective dose being 0.1 mg/kg body wt. L-364,718 also prevented the caerulein-induced pancreatic inflammation as seen by light microscopy. L-364,718 offered no protective effects as determined by changes in serum amylase, pancreatic weight, histology, or mortality in the ethionine-supplemented choline-deficient diet model.", 
    "36": "The cholinergic modulation of histamine release and synthesis was studied in rat brain slices or synaptosomes labeled with L-[3H]histidine. Carbachol in increasing concentrations progressively reduced the K+-induced [3H]histamine release from cortical slices. Pirenzepine, a preferential M1-receptor antagonist, reversed the carbachol effect in an apparently competitive manner and with Ki values of 1-6 X 10(-8) M. 11-[(2-[(Diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), considered a preferential M2-receptor antagonist, reversed the carbachol effect with a mean Ki of approximately 2 X 10(-7) M. Oxotremorine behaved as a partial agonist in the modulation of histamine release. Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, inhibited the K+-induced release of [3H]histamine from cortical slices, and the effect was largely reversed by pirenzepine, an observation suggesting a modulation by endogenous acetylcholine. The effects of carbachol and pirenzepine were observed with slices of other brain regions known to contain histaminergic nerve terminals or perikarya, as well as with cortical synaptosomes. The two drugs also modified, in opposite directions, [3H]histamine formation in depolarized cortical slices. In vivo oxotremorine inhibited [3H]histamine formation in cerebral cortex, and this effect was reversed by scopolamine. When administered alone, scopolamine failed to enhance significantly the 3H- labeled amine formation, a finding suggesting that muscarinic receptors are not activated by endogenous acetylcholine released under basal conditions. It is concluded that muscarinic heteroreceptors, directly located on histaminergic nerve terminals, control release and synthesis of histamine in the brain. These receptors apparently belong to the broad M1-receptor category and may correspond to a receptor subclass displaying a rather high affinity for AF-DX 116.", 
    "37": "The advent of several new column materials for the resolution of chiral compounds in high-performance liquid chromatography has opened up new possibilities for the analysis of drug enantiomers both in the dosage form and in bioanalytical studies. The utility of simplex optimisation, modified simplex and response surface mapping are considered with reference to the antischistosomal drug, oxamniquine, separated on an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein column. The resolution of the enantiomers of three closely related benzodiazepines, temazepam, oxazepam and lorazepam, is attempted on three new column systems: cellulose triacetate, beta-cyclodextrin and the reversed-phase column porous graphitic carbon with beta-cyclodextrin as a mobile phase additive.", 
    "38": "Aqueous acid extracts of wheat grains and potato exhibit after HPLC separation a series of compounds that are able to inhibit the binding of benzodiazepines to benzodiazepine receptors of rat brain membranes. In wheat one of the inhibiting compounds was shown to be identical to diazepam by means of HPLC characterization and gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. In potato one of the most prominent components in terms of binding inhibiting activity was identified as lormetazepam. In wheat and potato germination increases total inhibiting activity of the whole plant extracts as well as the content of the benzodiazepines approximately by factor five. Because uptake of benzodiazepines from the surrounding was excluded these findings indicate the biosynthesis of the benzodiazepines diazepam and lormetazepam by the plants investigated.", 
    "39": "The effects of the beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor ligand FG 7142 upon local cerebral glucose utilization have been examined in conscious rats using the quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique. FG 7142 (1-10 mg/kg i.v.) produced behavioural changes consistent with an anxiogenic action. At the largest dose of FG 7142 (10 mg/kg) 30% of the animals experienced overt convulsions. In the data analysis animals were divided according to the behavioural response elicited by the drug. In animals not expressing convulsions, FG 7142 (1-10 mg/kg) effected increases in glucose utilization in 33 of the 65 regions examined. The majority of changes were confined to limbic structures with pronounced effects occurring in the mammillary body, anterior thalamic nuclei, septal nuclei and the oriens and molecular layers of the hippocampus. Glucose use in other structures associated with auditory and visual processing, such as the medial and lateral geniculate body, and associated cortical areas, was also significantly increased. However, brain regions involved in motor control were minimally affected. The patterns of local cerebral glucose use in animals expressing FG 7142-induced convulsions were contrasted with those from an equivalent non-seizure group. Some limbic structures which were significantly affected by FG 7142 (non-seizure group) displayed a further increase in glucose utilization during convulsions. These included the mammillary body and septum. Many other limbic structures (anterior thalamic nuclei, CA fields of the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala) did not display this further rise in glucose utilization. In the cortical amygdala, lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens and lateral elevations in glucose utilization were restricted to those animals experiencing overt convulsions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil were studied in 20 episodes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in 17 patients with acute (n = 9) or chronic (n = 8) liver failure who had not responded to conventional therapy. Patients with a history of benzodiazepine intake were excluded. Changes in HE stage, in Glasgow coma scale, and in somatosensory evoked potentials were measured. In 12 of 20 episodes HE stage improved. The response to treatment occurred rapidly (within 3-60 min). In 8 of these 12 episodes HE worsened 0.5-4 h after treatment. In 5 of the 8 episodes that did not respond to flumazenil patients had clinical evidence of brain oedema. Flumazenil may be valuable in the treatment of HE in acute and chronic liver failure.", 
    "41": "Binding studies in several species have demonstrated a high proportion of M1 muscarinic receptors in the lung but their localization is uncertain. Using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate we have confirmed that binding sites with high affinity for pirenzepine account for 50% of muscarinic receptors in the rat lung. Our functional studies using the muscarinic antagonists 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP), methoctramine and pirenzepine have demonstrated that the muscarinic receptor on the rat pulmonary artery endothelium which mediates vasodilation is of the M3 subtype and cannot account for the high proportion of M1 receptors identified in lung homogenates.", 
    "42": "The metabolism and the anticonvulsant effect of clorazepate were followed for 2 h after its i.v. administration to mice. The ED50 of the drug was 12 mg/kg at 1 min against pentetrazole-induced convulsions (45 mg/kg i.v.), it reached a minimum at 1 h (2.0 mg/kg) and rose to 2.7 mg/kg at 2 h. The concentrations of unchanged clorazepate and its metabolites, desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam, were determined in plasma and brain after administration of the respective ED50s. Unchanged clorazepate could be detected in plasma for the first hour but never in brain, so it can be considered as inactive pro-drug. The brain concentrations of desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam after the respective ED50s of clorazepate were considerably higher at 1 and 15 min than after longer time intervals. This may be explained by a time lag needed to reach and bind to the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "43": "The present study was designed to further characterize the presynaptic muscarinic M1-receptor responsible for the inhibition of neurogenic contractions in the isolated rabbit vas deferens. Electrically induced twitch contractions of this preparation were inhibited by the M1-agonist, McN-A-343, and by some of its analogs: 4-chloro-phenyl derivative greater than McN-A-343 greater than trans-olefinic analog greater than cis-olefinic analog. The same rank order of potency was observed for these agonists to raise the blood pressure of pithed rats by stimulation of M1-receptors in sympathetic ganglia. A highly significant correlation was found between the antimuscarinic potencies of atropine, pirenzepine and a series of 9 antagonists structurally related to the ganglionic M1 beta-receptor selective compounds, hexocyclium and hexahydro-difenidol, to antagonize the McN-A-343-induced inhibition of twitch contractions in rabbit vas deferens or the muscarine-induced depolarization in rat isolated superior cervical ganglia. It is suggested that the presynaptic muscarinic receptor that mediates inhibition of neurogenic contractions in rabbit vas deferens is of the ganglionic M1 beta-type.",

Among this population 12,424 patients (70.4%) happened to have been treated with hypnotics, sedatives or anxiolytics. Results are as follows: 1. The occurrence rate of psychic and neurologic symptoms (with the exception of somnolence and hangover) is 0.14% of all treatments if the casualty category \"definitely or probably drug-induced\" is considered. For \"other ADR\" (non-psychic, non-neurologic) the rate is 0.16%. For the benzodiazepine preparations, the psychic and neurologic ADR occurred at about the same rate as for the neuroleptic drugs studied, whereas \"other ADR\" related to benzodiazepines were observed in only 0.04% of treatments. 2. There is a marked difference in ADR symptoms between benzodiazepines and neuroleptics. With benzodiazepines the most severe reactions were two episodes of shortlived respiratory arrest immediately after intravenous administration. With neuroleptic drugs the most severe symptoms were choreoathetosis, dyskinesia, hyperkinesia and Parkinson's syndrome. There was no fatal reaction. 3. With benzodiazepines there is a slight but significant increase in the occurrence of psychic and neurologic symptoms in the older group of patients, as compared to the younger patients, whereas with neuroleptics there is no age dependence.",

Functional analysis of the chimaeric mAChRs indicates that a region mostly comprising the putative cytoplasmic portion between the proposed transmembrane segments V and VI is involved in selective coupling of mAChR I and mAChR II with different effector systems. In contrast, the exchange of this region between mAChR I and mAChR II does not significantly affect the antagonist binding properties of the two mAChR subtypes.", 
    "46": "An highly sensitive and fully automated high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was developed for the determination of a novel non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic (I) [(R)-2-(methoxymethyl)-1-[(7-oxo-8-phenyl-7H-thieno[2,3-a]quinolizin+ ++- 10-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidine] and its O-demethyl metabolite (II) in plasma, using column-switching for direct injection of plasma samples. After dilution in internal standard solution, the sample was injected onto a pre-column (17 mm x 4.6 mm) dry-packed with pellicular C18 reversed-phase material. Polar plasma components were removed by flushing the pre-column with water-acetonitrile (90:10, v/v). Retained substances, including I and II, were backflushed onto an analytical column, separated by gradient elution and detected by means of fluorescence detection (excitation, 304 nm; emission, 475 nm). After washing the analytical column and re-equilibrating the pre-column, the system was ready for the next injection. The limit of quantification for I and II was 0.25 and 0.5 ng/ml, respectively, using a 350-microliter specimen of plasma. The practicability of the new method was demonstrated by analysis of more than 300 plasma samples from a tolerance study performed with human volunteers. Owing to its high sensitivity, the method can be used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters of compounds I and II in man after a single oral dose of about 1 mg of I.", 
    "47": "Effects of GABAA-, barbiturate- and benzodiazepine receptor agonists and GABAB agonist, baclofen, on voltage-dependent Ca2+ current (ICa) were studied in isolated frog sensory neurons after suppression of Na+ and K+ currents using single-electrode voltage-clamp. GABA, muscimol, taurine and pentobarbital (PB) dose-dependently induced a transient Cl- current (ICl), while baclofen and diazepam (DZP) did not elicit any currents. With GABAA agonists such as GABA, muscimol and taurine, ICa was suppressed transiently, and the maximum inhibition of ICa occurred within 1 min. The suppression of ICa by all GABAA agonists was neither voltage dependent nor attenuated in the presence of either bicuculline or picrotoxin. In addition, there was no correlation between GABA- and baclofen-induced suppressions of ICa. The results suggest that the inhibition of ICa by GABAA receptor agonists is not due to either GABAA or GABAB receptor activation at least. The inhibition of ICa by baclofen, PB and DZP was persistent. PB suppressed the amplitude of ICa and also facilitated the inactivation process, suggesting that PB behaves as a Ca channel blocker. However, the mechanisms of ICa suppression by baclofen and DZP are the subject for a future study. The potency order of the drugs in reducing ICa was muscimol greater than GABA = DZP greater than baclofen greater than PB greater than taurine.",

    "49": "The partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist Ro15-4513 has been found to antagonize some of the behavioral and physiological effects of low to moderate doses of ethanol. In the present study, pretreating rats with Ro15-4513 (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) at doses equal to or greater than those used in prior investigations failed to block the lethal effects of intraperitoneal injections of ethanol at a dose of 5.4 g/kg. These results suggest that the lethal actions of ethanol may involve a mechanism that is not blocked by Ro15-4513, which is known to selectively antagonize ethanol-stimulated chloride uptake via the GABA-coupled chloride ion channel.", 
    "50": "Forty-eight hours after a single dose of lorazepam (0.25 mg/kg), there was tolerance to the lorazepam-induced reduction of locomotor activity in the holeboard; but no tolerance to the reductions in exploratory head-dipping or rearing. Mice tested undrugged at this time showed significant hyperactivity and increased rearing, indicating withdrawal responses, but no change in head-dipping. In the elevated plus-maze, no tolerance could be detected to the effects of lorazepam (0.25 mg/kg) when the mice were tested 48 hr after an initial dose; in fact, there was a trend towards enhanced effects in this group. When mice were tested undrugged 24, 48 or 72 hr after a single dose of lorazepam there was an increase in the % time spent on the open arms, compared with controls, that reached significance for the 24 hr group. This indicates a sensitization to the anxiolytic effects of lorazepam, as assessed in the plus-maze. These results demonstrate long-lasting effects of even a single dose of lorazepam.", 
    "51": "beta-Adrenergic hyperreactivity has been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism of increased coronary risk in Type A individuals. This study compared the effects of propranolol, diazepam, and placebo on cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to a stressful cognitive task in six young Type A males. Although diazepam did not differ from placebo, propranolol attenuated heart rate and norepinephrine responses and enhanced cortisol responses to the task. Findings suggest that propranolol has reciprocal effects on the norepinephrine and cortisol components of the \"fight-flight\" response. Possible central nervous system mechanisms are described.",

However, her respiration and blood pressure were normal, and disturbance of consciousness was mild and normalized at 77 hours. The clinical correlations of the concentrations of DZP and its active metabolite are discussed.", 
    "53": "As part of an investigation on the behavioral characteristics of SART-stressed animals, an animal model of autonomic imbalance, the open-field behavior of SART-stressed (repeated cold-stressed) rats was studied and compared with that of rats exposed to other types of stress. In addition, the effects of several drugs on it were also studied. As compared with normal rats, SART-stressed rats exhibited increased locomotor activity, rearing and center-field penetration, together with decreased grooming and increased defecation, whereas they showed no significant changes in spontaneous movements in the daytime as measured by an Animex activity meter. These behavioral abnormalities were remarkably different from those due to 1-hr cold, 48-hr cold and repeated restraint stresses. These abnormal forms of open-field behavior due to SART stress were considerably inhibited by chlorpromazine, imipramine and neurotropin at doses having no corresponding influence on normal rats; and they were partially inhibited by alprazolam, diazepam and carpipramine at doses exerting considerable influence on normal rats. The above results show that SART-stressed rats exhibit open-field behavioral abnormalities that are different from those of rats exposed to other types of stress. Such abnormalities include excessive activity, which is considered to be caused by excessive emotionality.", 
    "54": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of senescence on the binding characteristics of muscarinic receptors by using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) and [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) as ligands in young (3 months), middle-age (10 months) and old (24 months) male Fischer 344 rats. Muscarinic receptor density was found to decrease significantly with aging in certain brain regions, depending on the ligand employed. Moreover, the relative proportions of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes was not significantly altered by aging, except in the aged striatum. Furthermore, the dissociation kinetics of [3H]NMS in the cerebral cortex and their allosteric modulation by gallamine were only slightly influenced by age.", 
    "55": "The development and time course of benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence is reported for five case histories. The underlying psychiatric disorders, life-events as potential initiators of BZD use/abuse and psychosocial consequences are discussed. The abstinence symptoms appearing during a course of standardized withdrawal therapy are described in detail. The case reports clearly demonstrate the chronic nature of the development of BZD dependence and of the tendency to increase the dosage which may occur only after years of intake and the gradual appearance of negative effects of chronic BZD intake.", 
    "56": "The subjective, psychomotor and cognitive effects of oral doses of lorazepam (0, 1.5, 3 and 6 mg) and diazepam (0, 10, 20 and 40 mg) were studied under double-blind conditions in 14 volunteers with histories of 'recreational' benzodiazepine use/abuse. For each subject, drug was administered over 4 test days in a 2 (drug) by 4 (dose level) mixed design. Drug was the between-groups factor while dose was the within-subjects factor. Test days were separated by at least 1 week. The results showed that subjective ratings of drug 'liking' and the psychomotor and cognitive effects of lorazepam were generally similar to those of diazepam over the range of doses studied. Lorazepam, however, tended to produce effects of longer duration than diazepam. Since previous studies have shown that diazepam has a relatively high abuse liability among the benzodiazepines, the present findings suggest that lorazepam shares this property with diazepam is subjects with a history of 'recreational' drug use/abuse.", 
    "57": "A case-control study was carried out on 107 benzodiazepine users and 214 controls not treated with anxiolytic-hypnotic agents, chosen randomly and matched two to one for each case by age, sex and family doctor. The users presented a higher degree of psychic disorder than the controls, with depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and the total number of symptoms being the elements distinguishing the two groups. We have found two factors that put the population at large at risk for using benzodiazepines; the family doctor's diagnosis of a mental disorder in the clinical history and the daily use of drugs other than benzodiazepines explained the risk independently. The presence of chronic disorders, especially cardiological and musculoskeletal disorders, also showed a significant risk, but were only explained by their close association with one of the first two factors. It is postulated that general practitioners, who are the principal prescribers of drugs, are causing over-medication in the population.", 
    "58": "In 37 consecutive depressed inpatients afternoon plasma cortisol (1500-1520 h) was measured in 3 ways: 1) spontaneously; 2) 2 h after oral administration of 60 mg oxazepam; and 3) 16 h after oral administration of 2 mg dexamethasone. Both oxazepam and dexamethasone caused a significant suppression of cortisol secretion. Spontaneous and suppressed cortisol levels correlated significantly to stress/distress items on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (sum of items 8, 9, 10 and 12), whereas no correlations to age, or type of depression were found. In an earlier similar study of 35 patients both spontaneous and suppressed cortisol levels correlated significantly with age, type and severity of depression as well as with the stress/distress items. Those patients were older, more depressed (HRSD-17) and had higher stress/distress scores compared with the present sample of 37 patients. The consistent finding of a correlation with the stress/distress items suggest that this factor is important in relation to the hypersecretion of cortisol during depression and this may explain the limited diagnostic power of spontaneous and suppressed cortisol levels.", 
    "59": "The effects of diazepam on antroduodenal motility, gastric pH and gastric emptying rate were investigated in 10 volunteers. Gastric emptying was assessed using paracetamol absorption and antroduodenal motility and pH by means of a perfused multilumen tube. On the first study day, the volunteers received paracetamol in phase I after the occurrence of one complete interdigestive motility complex (IDMC). Diazepam was given on the second study day at the beginning of the first phase I and paracetamol was given one IDMC later. The rate of absorption correlated with motility (P less than 0.03). Some volunteers were fast absorbers on the first study day and slow on the second, indicating that absorption rate is not constant, but dependent on gastroduodenal motility. Diazepam tended to increase the gastric emptying rate and enhanced the amplitude of contractions and the motility index during phase II (P less than 0.02). Gastric pH increased after ingestion of diazepam (P less than 0.05).", 
    "60": "The respiratory-depressant effect of the benzodiazepine-derived hypnotic triazolam was investigated with a single oral dose at two and three times the usual dosage in 62 awake normal subjects. A randomized, double-blind protocol compared the following groups: (1) placebo, (2) triazolam, 1.0 mg, (3) triazolam, 1.5 mg, and (4) morphine, 0.15 mg/kg. Differences between predrug and postdrug administration were compared. Minute ventilation (Ve), end-tidal PCO2, and the ventilatory response to CO2 (Ve/PCO2) were preserved with both 1.0 mg and 1.5 mg triazolam compared with placebo. Triazolam caused an increase in breathing frequency (+21% to 50%; p less than 0.05) as a result of a shortening of inspiratory time. Triazolam was associated with a higher Ve corrected for CO2 production and Ve/PCO2 compared with morphine. We concluded that a single dose of triazolam at two and three times the usual level does not cause respiratory depression in awake, normal subjects but does alter respiratory cycle timing causing an increase in breathing frequency.", 
    "61": "The effects of intraperitoneal (IP) and lumbar intrathecal (IT) midazolam (MID) on nociception was studied in 38 male albino rats using the noxious tale-flick and hot-plate tests. Four groups received IP 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg MID or an equal volume of its vehicle benzyl alcohol 0.1 mg in 1 ml saline, while the other three groups received IT 10 and 100 micrograms MID or 0.5 microgram benzyl alcohol in 5 microliter saline. The two higher doses of IP MID produced statistically significant decrease of tale-flick latencies (P less than 0.005 and 0.05 at 10 and 100 mg/kg MID, respectively). This hyperalgesic effect could be seen, although the animals appeared highly sedated with reduced motor activity and relatively unresponsive to non-noxious stimuli. In contrast, IT injections of 10 micrograms MID produced moderate but statistically significant prolongation of tail-flick latencies (P less than 0.05) without noticeable change in motor activity. This analgesic effect could not be observed with the higher dose of IT MID until an hour after its administration. The almost complete immobility and ataxia seen after the high doses of IP and IT MID (animals lying on their sides) precluded reliable hot plate testing in these animals. Apparently part of the high IT dose of MID diffused into the brain, as observed after high-dose IP administration. We therefore propose that the analgesic effect of midazolam stems from its action at the spinal level, while its sedative and hyperalgesic effects are a function of its supraspinal action.", 
    "62": "A survey of drug-related admissions of patients aged 50 years and older was conducted at the Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg to determine the interrelationship of risk factors, and isolate the effect of age. All nonelective medical admissions were prospectively assessed to determine the role of drug therapy as a contributory factor. Of the 863 eligible admissions, 162 exhibited at least one drug-related adverse patient event (DRAPE) at the time of hospitalization. This accounted for 19% of the admissions (23% of 718 admissions that involved prescription drugs). Although adverse drug reactions were responsible for many DRAPEs (48%), intentional noncompliance (27%), treatment failure (19%), alcohol (14%), and medication error (10%) were also frequent contributing causes. Drugs commonly implicated in DRAPEs were systemic steroids, digoxin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, alpha-methyldopa, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, theophylline, furosemide, sympathomimetics, thiazides, and benzodiazepines. The risk of a DRAPE was related to the number of diseases prior to admission (r = 0.81; P less than .026) and the number of drugs used (r = 0.77; P less than .001). Age was not correlated with the risk of a DRAPE. Females had significantly more adverse drug reactions, although sex was not a predictor for overall DRAPE risk.", 
    "63": "Anxiety prior to dental treatment is a well-recognized problem. Although oral sedation has been recommended the night before appointments to reduce this anxiety, there are no well-controlled studies to support this claim. The present double-blind cross-over study investigated the effect of 30 mg of flurazepam taken the night before the removal of impacted third molars. Preoperative anxiety, visuomotor performance and sleep patterns were investigated in 20 adult patients with similarly impacted third molars. While preoperative flurazepam led to a statistically significant improvement in sleep patterns, there was no reduction in pre-operative anxiety on the morning of surgery. In addition, the flurazepam-treated group demonstrated significantly impaired visuo-motor performance 60 min after intravenous sedation compared to this group where intravenous sedation was used only preceded by placebo. Patients had a significant preference for flurazepam over placebo as a night-time sedative.", 
    "64": "In conclusion, DNAB lesions have been shown to have two, apparently contradictory effects in a food preference test: to increase neophobia to a novel environment, and to increase the tendency to eat novel food in a novel environment. It has been suggested that these two effects occur because, although NA has a common action on neuronal firing in terminal fields, the dissociable consequences reflect the different functions of areas in receipt of these noradrenergic afferents. In addition, it has been shown that DNAB lesions, VNAB lesions, and a benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, all have somewhat different behavioral effects in the food preference test. Taken together with the lack of correlation between the various behavioral measures used in these experiments, this suggests that neophobia does not reflect a single behavioral process, such as anxiety, or reactivity to novelty.", 
    "65": "The irritable bowel syndrome is discussed together with some of its theories, methods of investigation and various treatment regimens. Eight case histories are reported. In each patient, symptoms appeared to be precipitated by situations interpreted by that patient as stressful. A programme of prospective desensitization using hypnosis is described. Where symptoms of depression were additionally present, antidepressant medication was prescribed. This was subsequently phased out as and when indicated. Where patients had been taking antidiarrhoeal or antispasmodic drugs, various stool bulking agents or benzodiazepines, these were also slowly discontinued as treatment progressed. Cases were followed up from 3 months to 12 years. In 2 cases recurrence of symptoms was again successfully treated. There was no recurrence of any of the bowel symptoms in any other patient. The results support the view that the irritable bowel syndrome is psychogenic in origin.", 
    "66": "Amnesia for unpleasant experiences in the immediate preoperative period, reduction of anxiety, and sedation are the major goals of premedication. The purpose of this randomized double-blind study was to evaluate the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepine oxazepam. Following approval by the ethics commission and informed consent, 60 ASA class I and II female patients undergoing surgical treatment of radiologically evaluated breast lesions were studied prospectively using the Mannheim protocol for subjective feeling (MESB) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to evaluate intensity levels of preoperative anxiety. During a preoperative visit patients were informed about the management of the study: they were asked to report their subjective feelings preoperatively and immediately before induction. Either oxazepam 30 mg or placebo was administered orally in a double-blind manner 90 min before induction. Preoperative anxiety levels were high in both groups. Following administration of the drug, anxiety-intensity decreased significantly on the MESB and STAI. Oxazepam is a useful oral premedicant for providing effective anxiolysis in the immediate perioperative period compared to placebo. The Mannheim protocol for subjective feeling seems to be a better scoring system for evaluating perioperative anxiety as compared to the STAI. It consists of criteria with which the patients can identify themselves during the perioperative phase.", 
    "67": "One hundred patients received either diazepam given with pethidine, antagonized with naloxone, or midazolam alone in a double-blind randomized study of sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Midazolam produced better amnesia for the procedure (P less than 0.0001) but diazepam and pethidine resulted in less retching during the procedure (P less than 0.01) and less sedation after the procedure, as judged by a simple performance test (P less than 0.02) and patient recall of results (P less than 0.02).", 
    "68": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a continuous seizure that lasts more than 30 minutes or as serial seizures in which the patient does not regain a premorbid level of consciousness. This condition exists primarily in two forms: convulsive (focal or generalized) and nonconvulsive (absence or partial complex) SE. Protracted or serial convulsive seizures represent a medical emergency with a current mortality rate of 10%. As in any urgent or life-threatening situation, the initial treatment is directed at support and maintenance of vital functions. Specific anticonvulsant management is usually begun with intravenous lorazepam. This benzodiazepine is replacing diazepam in many medical centers because it has a longer duration of action and causes less respiratory depression. Concurrent intravenous loading with phenytoin is usually necessary for sustained control of seizures. Phenobarbital may be required as a third drug if seizures persist or recur. In cases of refractory status epilepticus, barbiturate coma, continuous anticonvulsant intravenous infusion, or general anesthesia may be necessary.", 
    "69": "Six papers have reported the efficacy of lorazepam in alleviating catatonic symptoms that have psychogenic causes. The authors report five new cases of catatonia; three patients responded favorably and two failed to respond to lorazepam. Investigation of the nonresponders revealed the presence of pernicious anemia in one and postpartum psychosis in the other. These findings demonstrate that lorazepam has an important role in the treatment of catatonic symptoms. Its effects appear to be specific for psychogenic catatonic states and for conditions in which biogenic amines, specifically dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, play a part. The authors stress intramuscular administration of lorazepam for patients in catatonic states because this route provides the psychiatrist with immediate results that assist with early diagnosis and treatment.", 
    "70": "The author reviews prior evidence and presents data from his prospective study comparing intramuscular lorazepam with intramuscular haloperidol for control of extreme, agitated psychotic behavior; the data demonstrate that lorazepam is effective and has fewer side effects than haloperidol. The effective intramuscular dose is 1 to 2 mg in conjunction with ongoing neuroleptic antipsychotic treatment. Lorazepam does not prevent future disruptive behavior, and data do not support its use as an agent for maintenance therapy.", 
    "71": "In a double-blind, randomized plan of drug administration, nalbuphine, fentanyl, and a placebo were compared for efficacy in sedation and analgesia during third molar removal. Fifty-eight patients participated in this study. Using accepted intravenous sedation and surgical techniques, fentanyl and nalbuphine were found to be better than placebo for anxiety and pain control in third molar surgery. Fentanyl had a longer duration of pain relief postoperatively than did nalbuphine. The study confirmed the need for a narcotic supplement to sedation techniques for third molar surgery.", 
    "72": "This study examined whether pharmacological manipulation of serotonergic (5-HT) systems would affect the hypnotic action of flunitrazepam in rats. Flunitrazepam, a potent hypnotic, was used alone or combined with parachlorophenylalanine (pCPA), an inhibitor of the synthesis of 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of the reuptake of 5-HT. Flunitrazepam increased the amount of orthodox sleep, the latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and decreased the amount of REM sleep. The drug pCPA decreased the total sleep time and the amount of orthodox and REM sleep. Administration of flunitrazepam to pCPA-pretreated rats induced orthodox sleep in an identical way to that found in the controls. The drug 8-OH-DPAT increased wakefulness and the latency of REM sleep. The association of flunitrazepam with 8-OH-DPAT abolished the increase in waking seen after 8-OH-DPAT alone. In contrast, the combined treatment with flunitrazepam and 8-OH-DPAT resulted in a lengthening of the latency of REM sleep significantly greater than that observed with the same dose of each drug alone. Fluvoxamine increased the latency a decrease the amount of REM sleep. The association of fluvoxamine with flunitrazepam induced a decrease in REM sleep, equal to the sum of the effects of the two drugs alone. Fluvoxamine did not modify the other effects of flunitrazepam. The present experiments demonstrate that the association of pCPA, 8-OH-DPAT and fluvoxamine, did not alter the hypnogenic effect of flunitrazepam. The possibility of an involvement of 5-HT mechanisms in the effect of flunitrazepam on the phasic events in sleep is questionable."
