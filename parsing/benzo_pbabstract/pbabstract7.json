Of the 835 remaining subjects, 25% screened positive for delirium, 13% were classified as comatose, and 62% were delirium-free and coma-free. Delirium prevalence rates varied significantly with reason for ICU admission, with highest delirium rates found in children admitted with an infectious or inflammatory disorder. For children who were in the PICU for 6 or more days, delirium prevalence rate was 38%. In a multivariate model, risk factors independently associated with development of delirium included age less than 2 years, mechanical ventilation, benzodiazepines, narcotics, use of physical restraints, and exposure to vasopressors and antiepileptics.",

Further multi-institutional, longitudinal studies are required to investigate effect of delirium on long-term outcomes and possible preventive and treatment measures. Universal delirium screening is practical and can be implemented in pediatric critical care units.", 
    "7": "Determining the manner of death in medicolegal death investigations can be difficult. The investigator relies on many facets of death investigation, including the circumstances of death and autopsy examination. A study was designed to analyze whether the intoxication status of the decedent could be used as another tool in death investigations. The intoxication status of violent (nonoverdose or poisoning) suicides and homicides was retrospectively reviewed and compared. A total of 625 deaths were identified, including 366 suicides and 259 homicides. Age, sex, cause of death, and intoxication status, including the specific drugs present, were analyzed. Gunshot wounds were the most common cause of death in both groups, with hanging being the second most common cause in suicides and sharp force injuries in homicides. Analysis found that although the overall intoxication status for suicides versus homicides did not differ significantly, certain drugs were more prevalent in one group over the other. Specifically, illicit drugs, that is, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, were more likely to be present in homicides, whereas antidepressants or antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and zolpidem were more common in suicides.",

Because the initiation of benzodiazepine use shortly before the AD diagnosis date may occur as a result of symptomatic treatment of prodromal symptoms of early major neurocognitive disorder, we introduced an induction period of 2 years before the AD diagnosis date. Additionally, we categorized medication use by duration of use prior to the index date using prescriptions. We applied conditional logistic regression analyses to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and adjusted for use of antidepressants.", 
    "11": "The crude odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of developing AD for patients starting benzodiazepine treatment was 1.71 (1.17-2.99) in the year before diagnosis and 1.19 (0.82-1.72) in the third year before diagnosis. After accounting for benzodiazepine use initiated during the prodromal phase, benzodiazepine use was not associated with an increased risk of developing AD; long-term benzodiazepine use (\u226530 prescriptions) yielded an adjusted odds ratio of 0.78 (0.53-1.14).",

    "13": "Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome that has been reported to occur in more than 10% of patients with acute psychiatric illnesses. Two subtypes of the syndrome have been identified. Catatonia of the retarded type is characterized by immobility, mutism, staring, rigidity, and a host of other clinical signs. Excited catatonia is a less common presentation in which patients develop prolonged periods of psychomotor agitation. Once thought to be a subtype of schizophrenia, catatonia is now recognized to occur with a broad spectrum of medical and psychiatric illnesses, particularly affective disorders. In many cases, the catatonia must be treated before any underlying conditions can be accurately diagnosed. Most patients with the syndrome respond rapidly to low-dose benzodiazepines, but electroconvulsive therapy is occasionally required. Patients with longstanding catatonia or a diagnosis of schizophrenia may be less likely to respond. The pathobiology of catatonia is poorly understood, although abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have been suggested as causative factors. Because catatonia is common, highly treatable, and associated with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated, physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for this complex clinical syndrome. Since 1989, we have systematically assessed patients presenting to our psychiatry service with signs of retarded catatonia. In this paper, we present a review of the current literature on catatonia along with findings from the 220 cases we have assessed and treated.",

    "17": "The highest dose of FC (25mg/kg/day) caused diarrhea, weight loss and death of one animal. Elevated plus maze test showed that lower doses [2.5mg/kg/day (36.4\u00b15.1s) and 5mg/kg/day (43.9\u00b16.2s)] increased the time spent in open arms (TSOA). Open field test revealed reduction in the number of crossings (54.9%, 51.1%, 48% and 67.7% for 2.5, 5, 10 and 25mg/kg/day, respectively) in all doses of FC studied and decrease of rearings at 25mg/kg/day (p<0.05).

Diagnostic work-up and follow-up routines of COFP patients should include assessment of sleep problems. Management is based on a multidisciplinary approach, addressing the factors that modulate the pain experience as well as insomnia and including both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities. Parallel to treatment, patients should receive therapy for comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders, and possible substance abuse that may be that may trigger or worsen the COFP and/or their insomnia. Insomnia treatment should begin with non-pharmacological therapy, to minimize potential side effects, drug interactions, and risk of substance abuse associated with pharmacological therapy. Behavioral therapies for insomnia include the following: sleep hygiene, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, multicomponent behavioral therapy or brief behavioral therapy for insomnia, relaxation strategies, stimulus control, and sleep restriction. Approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration medications to treat insomnia include the following: benzodiazepines (estazolam, flurazepam, temazepam, triazolam, and quazepam), non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem), the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon, the antidepressant doxepin, and the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant. Chronic orofacial pain can greatly improve following treatment of the underlying insomnia, and therefore, re-evaluation of COFP is advised after 1\u00a0month of treatment.",

Patients sedated with propofol (n=284, median dose 75mg) achieved a deeper level of sedation (45% vs. 25% deep sedation, p<0.001), had a higher procedure success rate (92% vs. 81%, p<0.001) and shorter median sedation duration (10 vs. 17min, p<0.001) compared to patients receiving midazolam (n=308, median dose 4mg). A total of 112 sedation events were registered for 99 patients. Transient apnea was the most prevalent event (n=73), followed by oxygen desaturation (n=18) airway obstruction responsive to simple maneuvers (n=13) and hypotension (n=6). Propofol sedations were more often associated with the occurrence of apnea's (20% vs. 10%, p=0.004), whereas clinically relevant oxygen desaturations (<90%) were found more often in patients sedated with midazolam (8% vs. 1%, p=0.001). No sedation adverse events were registered CONCLUSION: Propofol is more effective and at least as safe as midazolam for procedural sedation in the ED.",

According to our results there is a predominance of male patients and the majority of the poisoned patients were between 20-30 years old. Drug poisoning was the most common cause of poisonings. The most frequently involved drugs were benzodiazepines and antidepressants. The seasonal distribution of our study showed a peak in summer. To prevent acute poisonings, the social education about the risk assessment of central nervous system-acting drugs and reduction of the exposure period of people to pesticides are recommended.

Data from the MEDALZ cohort including all community-dwelling persons newly diagnosed with AD between 2005 and 2011 in Finland were utilized. Incident BZDR users were identified with a 1-year washout period for previous use. Persons with a previous stroke were excluded, resulting in a final study sample of 45\u2009050 individuals. Incident any, ischemic, and hemorrhagic strokes were identified from the Hospital Discharge and Causes of Death registers. The risk of stroke between time on BZDRs was compared with nonuse time with Cox proportional hazard models. During the follow-up, 21.9% (N=9879) of persons started BZDR use. Compared with nonuse, BZDR use was associated with an increased risk of any stroke [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.40] and ischemic stroke (aHR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.02-1.44), but the association between BZDR use and hemorrhagic stroke did not reach significance (aHR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.91-1.74). Z-drug use was associated with a similar risk as benzodiazepine use. In conclusion, BZDR use was associated with an increased risk of stroke among older individuals with AD.",

The most common diagnoses were affective disorders (39.3%), organic mental disorders (18.9%), alcohol-induced mental disorders (11.3%) and reactions to severe stress/adjustment disorders (10.4%). Organic mental disorders were significantly more common in patients seen in the LM (24.0% vs. 10.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) while affective disorders were more frequently diagnosed in the ODM (46.6% vs. 34.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Patients seen in the ODM were, on average, more severely affected compared to patients seen in the LM and required more extensive treatment. 16.3% of ODM patients were regarded as potentially suicidal; among these, 3.5% were acutely suicidal and 12.8% latently suicidal. Any form of further treatment was required by 93.0% of ODM patients compared to 77.8% in the LM.

For further clarifying the distribution of clonazepam in vivo and the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic mechanisms, the binding interaction between clonazepam and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated using ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and molecular docking methods. The results well confirmed that clonazepam bound on the subdomain III A (Site II) of BSA through van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding interaction, and quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA through a static quenching process. The number of binding sites (n) and binding constant (Kb) of clonazepam-BSA complex were about 1 and 7.94\u00d710(4)M(-1) at 308K, respectively. The binding process of clonazepam with BSA was spontaneous and enthalpy-driven process due to \u0394G(0)<0 and|\u0394H(0)|>T|\u0394S(0)| over the studied temperature range. Meanwhile, the binding interaction of clonazepam with BSA resulted in the slight change in the conformation of BSA and the obvious change in the conformation of clonazepam, implying that the flexibility of clonazepam also played an important role in increasing the stability of the clonazepam-BSA complex.",

Valproate is commonly the first choice alone or in combination with some benzodiazepines or levetiracetam. However, more treatment options exist today as there is emerging evidence to support the efficacy of some newer antiepileptic drugs. In addition, of major importance remains avoidance of medications (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin) that may aggravate myoclonic seizures. This is an updated review on the available therapeutic options for treatment of myoclonic seizures. Areas covered: Key efficacy, tolerability and efficacy data are showed for different antiepileptic drugs with antimyoclonic effect, alone and/or in combination. Expert opinion: Pharmacological treatment of myoclonic seizures is based on clinical experience with little evidence from randomized clinical trials. Valproate, levetiracetam, and some benzodiazepines, are widely used. There is still insufficient evidence for the use of other antiseizure drugs, such as topiramate or zonisamide as monotherapy.

Groups III, IV, and V received CS in doses of 3.3, 16.5, and 33 mg/kg, respectively. Three pharmacologically validated experimental models - elevated plus maze (EPM), light and dark box (LDB), and open field tests (OFT) - were employed. Each animal was tested initially in the EPM and then in the LDB, followed by the OFT in a single setting. In EMP, number of entries into, time spent in, and number of rears in each arm in a 5-min period were noted. In LDB, number of entries and time spent in bright arena, number of rears, and duration of immobility were noted. In OFT, number of peripheral and central squares crossed, time spent, and number of rears in central squares were observed for a 5-min period. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc least significant difference test was performed.",

In the OFT, CS at 16.5 and 33 mg/kg significantly increased the number of squares crossed, time spent, and the number of rears in the central squares compared to control. Anxiolytic effect was dose dependent in EPM and LDB and CS at 33 mg/kg showed better anxiolytic activity compared to diazepam (1 mg/kg) in all models. Flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and bicuculline (1 mg/kg) completely inhibited while picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) partially inhibited the anxiolytic effect of CS. Diazepam and CS at 33 mg/kg reduced the locomotor activity in rats.",

    "56": "In the present study, we examined the effects of nicotine on cognitive impairment, anxiety-like behavior, and hippocampal cell proliferation in rats treated with a combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Combined treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide produced cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behavior in rats. Nicotine treatment reversed the inhibition of novel location recognition induced by the combination treatment. This effect of nicotine was blocked by methyllycaconitine, a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, and dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine, a selective \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR antagonist. In addition, nicotine normalized the amount of spontaneous alternation seen during the Y-maze task, which had been reduced by the combination treatment. This effect of nicotine was inhibited by dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine. In comparison, nicotine did not affect the anxiety-like behavior induced by the combination treatment. Furthermore, the combination treatment reduced the number of proliferating cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and this was also prevented by nicotine. Finally, the combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide significantly reduced hippocampal \u03b17 nAChR mRNA expression. These results suggest that nicotine inhibits doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide-induced cognitive impairment via \u03b17 nAChR and \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR, and also enhances hippocampal neurogenesis.", 
    "57": "Despite mounting evidence for the distinctiveness of symptom dimensions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, neuropsychological studies have been few, focused on small samples, and relying on classification of participants based on mutually exclusive symptom categories, resulting in lack of concordance across neuropsychological and imaging studies. Neuropsychological assessment was undertaken with 150 individuals with DSM IV OCD, and neuropsychological variables were analysed in relation to symptom dimension scores derived from factor analysis. Five dimensions were derived from principal components analysis with varimax rotation - contamination/washing, doubts/checking, symmetry/ordering, forbidden thoughts, and hoarding. After controlling for severity of depression and OCD, antipsychotic and benzodiazepine use, and all other symptom dimensions, washing was associated with poorer attention/working memory, visuo-spatial construction and better planning time; checking was related to poorer alternation learning; symmetry linked with poorer verbal fluency; forbidden thoughts with better visuospatial scanning and working memory; hoarding with poorer immediate verbal recall and better visuospatial working memory. The neuropsychological associations are explained in the context of existing neuroimaging evidence, and the clinical picture of each symptom dimension. The use of factor-analysed symptom dimensions and a large sample of individuals with OCD are strengths of the study.", 
    "58": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) and tear production are commonly affected by general anaesthesia. It is necessary to have a good control of both to guarantee successful ophthalmic surgery. The purpose of this research was to evaluate if the protocol based on the administration of morphine-alfaxalone-midazolam as premedication, alfaxalone as induction and sevoflurane as maintenance, can induce changes on IOP and Schirmer's tear test (STT-1) in healthy dogs. Twenty-two adult mixed-breed dogs scheduled for an ovariohysterectomy were enrolled for the study. IOP and STT-1 were registered at baseline (T0), 5 minutes (T1), 10 minutes (T2) and 15 minutes (T3) after premedication with a morphine-alfaxalone-midazolam combination; 5 minutes (T4) after induction with alfaxalone and 15 minutes (T5) and 25 minutes (T6) after maintenance with sevoflurane. A one-way analysis of variance was performed to analyse the difference between IOP and STT-1 over time, respectively. The present study shows a slightly statistically significant increase in IOP (P<0.05) after premedication, induction and maintenance that can be associated with this anaesthetic protocol. STT-1 showed a statistically significant reduction during all the procedures (P<0.001). These results should be taken into consideration, especially in dogs with damaged corneas, in those predisposed to glaucoma and in those due to undergo intraocular surgery. Ocular lubrication is necessary if this protocol is used.", 
    "59": "Anxiety is a common neuropsychiatric disorder which affects both physical and mental health. Complex neurobiological mechanisms are involved in the genesis of anxiety, and the drugs used to date, though effective, are not free from shortcomings. Conventional agents like the classical benzodiazepines and the atypical nonbenzodiazepine agents like buspirone have their own limitations. There is thus need to explore newer neurochemical pathways to develop efficacious and safer drugs for the disorder. Nitric oxide (NO) is a unique neuromodulator substance, with the ability to influence and modulate several other conventional messengers which play an important role in anxiety. The currently available experimental and clinical data indicate that NO may be involved in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior induced by a variety of stimuli. These studies have explored the pharmacological and biochemical basis of nitrergic mechanisms in anxiety, and the data available are equivocal. This chapter reviews the research data available in this specific area and suggests that in view of the nature of the existing data, there is considerable scope for future research in this field.", 
    "60": "Recently, metabolomics studies have suggested that the neurotransmitter \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) may modulate C. difficile infection (CDI) pathogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the association between GABA-modulating pharmaceuticals and CDI development.", 
    "61": "In July-December 2013, we performed a matched, retrospective case-control study in Sk\u00e5ne county, Sweden, to assess the association between the use of GABA-modulators (defined as regular use of at least one of the following: zolpidem, zopiclone, benzodiazepines, gabapentin, pregabalin or baclofen) and CDI. Multivariate regression models, adjusted for known risk factors for CDI, were fitted to assess the associations and a propensity score-adjusted analysis was performed.", 
    "62": "The study included 292 cases and 292 matched controls. In a multivariate regression model only recent antibiotic use (clindamycin, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones) and nursing home residency was significantly associated with CDI. The regular use of any GABA-modulator was not associated with CDI (OR = 1.07, 95%CI 0.69-1.66, p = 0.76). The association between regular use of the selective GABA-agonist zolpidem and CDI trended towards significance (OR = 2.31, 95%CI 0.91-5.86, p = 0.078). These associations remained when only cases treated with antibiotics were included. Corresponding findings for zolpidem was observed in a propensity-score adjusted analysis (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 0.91-6.97, p = 0.075). Severe initial CDI was significantly associated with CDI recurrence (OR = 3.77, 95% CU 1.20-11.86, p = 0.023).",

    "64": "Convulsive status epilepticus is the most extreme form of seizure. It is a medical and neurological emergency that requires prompt and appropriate treatment. Treatment of convulsive status epilepticus is usually divided into stages/steps. The International League Against Epilepsy has released a new definition of status epilepticus that may help to unify the definition in future studies. Over the last few years new information has become available regarding its management. The Rapid Anticonvulsant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial demonstrated non-inferiority of intramuscular midazolam in early status epilepticus compared with intravenous lorazepam. Valproate and levetiracetam have also emerged as possible alternatives to phenytoin in established status epilepticus. The potential role of lacosamide in this stage of status epilepticus remains to be defined. The ongoing Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial may help to determine the most effective treatment for benzodiazepine-resistant status epilepticus. Management of refractory status epilepticus and super-refractory status epilepticus remains mostly non-evidence-based. Increasing recognition of a possible autoimmune aetiology has led to the use of immune-modulation in super-refractory status epilepticus. Ketamine is also increasingly used in this challenging condition. There are also reports of potential use of a ketogenic diet and magnesium.", 
    "65": "Extrapyramidal symptoms are an uncommon but well-recognized side effect after the administration of general anesthesia in patients without a significant neurologic history. Several case reports implicate propofol as the likely causative agent producing these symptoms, which include ballismus, dystonia, choreoathetosis, and opisthotonus. Currently, there is no clear consensus on first-line treatment of these symptoms. In each of the published cases, anticholinergic medications and benzodiazepines were central to initial management, although the speed and extent of symptom resolution were variable. Here we present a case of a 17-year-old boy with ulcerative colitis who presented with ballismus, torticollis, tongue thrusting, and oculogyric movements after colonoscopy under general anesthesia with propofol. The patient responded promptly to treatment with diphenhydramine. This is the first reported case in which diphenhydramine was successfully used as the primary treatment of severe extrapyramidal symptoms in a pediatric patient after propofol administration.", 
    "66": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs in developed countries, but they have a high potential for tolerance, dependence and misuse. High-dose BZD misuse represents an emerging addiction phenomenon, but data on quality of life (QoL) in high-dose BZD misusers are scant. This study aimed to explore QoL in high-dose BZD misuse. We recruited 267 high-dose BZD misusers, compared the QoL scores in those who took BZD only to poly-drug misusers, and explored the role of demographic and clinical covariates through multivariable analysis. Our data confirmed worse QoL in high-dose BZD misusers and showed that (a) QoL scores were not negatively influenced by the misuse of alcohol or other drugs, or by coexisting psychiatric disorders; (b) demographic variables turned out to be the most significant predictors of QoL scores; (c) BZD intake significantly and negatively influenced QoL. Physical and psychological dimensions of QoL are significantly lower in high-dose BZD misusers with no significant effect of comorbidities. Our data suggest that the main reason for poor QoL in these patients is high-dose BZD intake per se. QoL should be considered among outcome measures in these patients.", 
    "67": "A highly feasible and reliable ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was presented for therapeutic drug monitoring of five anti-schizophrenic drugs (amisulpride, olanzapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone and ziprasidone) simultaneously. To meet the requirements of practical clinical usage (easy handling, high throughput and cost effectiveness), the pretreatment process was simplified (only including protein precipitation and mobile phase dilution steps) and the UPLC separation cycle was set within 6\u2009min. The whole methodology was carefully validated according to the latest international guidelines showing the excellent selectivity, accuracy, precision, applicability and stability. After a 10\u2009month clinical application, a retrospective analysis of 253 positive samples was carried out to investigate conformance with the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie therapeutic reference range for Chinese patients. The results suggested good consistency for olanzapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone and ziprasidone, while for amisulpride, the plasma concentration level (445.2\u2009\u00b1\u2009231.5\u2009ng/mL) was relatively higher than the recommended range (100-320\u2009ng/mL). We supposed that such phenomenon indicated the necessity of reconstructing a Chinese-specific therapeutic reference range for amisulpride treatment, which would be helpful to improve medication efficiency and safety for Chinese patients.", 
    "68": "The elderly population is increasing throughout the globe, resulting in higher healthcare costs. Potential inappropriate medication (PIM) prescriptions are a major health problem affecting the elderly persons. Due to limited studies in PIM use in primary care and home healthcare in Saudi Arabia, we aim to examine the extent of PIM prescription for and use by elderly patients. This study was carried out with 798 elderly patients, arbitrarily selected from Prince Sultan Medical Military City through the patient register. The mean age of the patients were in the range of 75.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5; 37.8% were males and 62.2% were females. The elderly patients are affected majorly with diabetes (73.9%), hypertension (83.2%) and lipid abnormalities (73.8%). The maximum patients involved in this study were affected with lower hemoglobin levels i.e. 99.2%. Renal impairment was found in 64% and iron supplements were the most commonly used in 23.1%, followed by analgesics and opioids (17%). The 52.5% of participants were using one or more PIMs. Kidney was the only functions and had influence on prescribed decisions. This study indicates PIM is a concern in elderly patients attending clinics and home residents and commonly prescribed ones are atypical antipsychotics, iron overdose, benzodiazepines and opioids. Prescription of drug-drug interactions, cascades and inappropriate drug doses results in preventable adverse effects.",

    "79": "The rodents exposed to repeated cold stress according to a specific schedule, known as specific alternation of rhythm in temperature (SART), exhibit autonomic imbalance, and is now used as an experimental model of fibromyalgia. To explore the susceptibility of SART-stressed animals to novel acute stress, we tested whether exposure of mice to SART stress for 1 week alters the extent of acute restraint stress-induced hyperthermia. Mice were subjected to 7-d SART stress sessions; i.e., the mice were alternately exposed to 24 and 4\u00b0C at 1-h intervals during the daytime (09:00-16:00) and kept at 4\u00b0C overnight (16:00-09:00). SART-stressed and unstressed mice were exposed to acute restraint stress for 20-60\u2009min, during which rectal temperature was monitored. Serum corticosterone levels were measured before and after 60-min exposure to restraint stress. SART stress itself did not alter the body temperature or serum corticosterone levels in mice. Acute restraint stress increased the body temperature and serum corticosterone levels, both responses being greater in SART-stressed mice than unstressed mice. The enhanced hyperthermic responses to acute restraint stress in SART-stressed mice were significantly attenuated by SR59230A, a \u03b23 adrenoceptor antagonist, but unaffected by diazepam, an anxiolytic, mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, or indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. These results suggest that SART stress enhances the susceptibility of mice to acute restraint stress, characterized by increased hyperthermia and corticosterone secretion, and that the increased hyperthermic responses to acute stress might involve accelerated activation of sympathetic \u03b23 adrenoceptors, known to regulate non-shivering thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue.", 
    "80": "The broad use of atypical antipsychotics was expected to dramatically reduce the prevalence and incidence of tardive dyskinesia (TD), but data show that TD remains an important challenge due the persistent nature of its symptoms and resistance to numerous treatment modalities, including antipsychotic discontinuation. Recent insights on genetic risk factors and new concepts surrounding pathophysiology have spurred interest in the possibility of targeted treatment for TD. As will be reviewed in this article, the number of evidence-based strategies for TD treatment is small: only clonazepam, amantadine, ginkgo biloba extract, and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor tetrabenazine have compelling data. Using new insights into the metabolism of tetrabenazine and the properties of its active metabolites, 2 modifications of tetrabenazine have been synthesized to improve the kinetic profile, and are currently involved in double-blind placebo controlled studies aimed at U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approval. The possible availability of these new agents, deuterated tetrabenazine and valbenazine, significantly widens the range of treatment choices for patients with TD. For clinicians with patients at risk for TD due to dopamine antagonist exposure, experience has shown that the problem of TD will be an ongoing issue in modern psychiatry, and that an appreciation of new developments in the pathophysiology of, risk factors for, and treatment of TD is crucial to managing this condition.", 
    "81": "The present study focuses on the effect of material used for the preparation of nanoparticulate (NP) systems and surface modification on the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine (OLN). NP carriers of OLN were prepared from two different materials such as polymer (polycaprolactone) and solid lipid (Glyceryl monostearate). These systems were further surface modified with surfactant, Polysorbate 80 and studied for pharmacokinetics-biodistribution in Wistar rats using in-house developed bioanalytical methods. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies resulted in a modified and varied distribution of NP systems with higher area under curve (AUC) values along with prolonged residence time of OLN in the rat blood circulation. The distribution of OLN to the brain was significantly enhanced with surfactant surface-modified NP systems, followed by nonsurface-modified NP formulations as compared with pure OLN solution. Biodistribution study demonstrated a low uptake of obtained NP systems by kidney and heart, thereby decreasing the nephrotoxicity and adverse cardiovascular effects. By coating the NP with surfactant, uptake of macrophage was found to be reduced. Thus, our studies confirmed that the biodistribution OLN could be modified effectively by incorporating in NP drug delivery systems prepared from different materials and surface modifications. A judicious selection of materials used for the preparation of delivery carriers and surface modifications would help to design a most efficient drug delivery system with better therapeutic efficacy.",

    "83": "A retrospective chart review on 5000 patients who underwent an outpatient colonoscopy at St. Paul's Hospital from 2009 to 2010 was conducted in order to develop a model for identifying patients who will require increased doses of sedatives. Potential predictor variables including age, gender, endoscopy indication, high sedation requirements during previous endoscopies, difficulty of the procedure, bowel preparation quality, interventions, findings as well as current use of benzodiazepines, opioids and alcohol were analyzed. The outcome of study was the use of high dose of sedation agents for the procedure. In particular, the high dose of sedation was defined as fentanyl greater than 50 mcg and midazolam greater than 3 mg.", 
    "84": "Analysis of 5282 patients (mean age 57 \u00b1 12, 49% female) was performed. Most common indication for the procedure was screening colonoscopy (57%). Almost half of our patients received doses exceeding Fentanyl 50 mcg and Midazolam 3 mg. Logistic regression models identified the following variables associated with high sedation: Younger age (OR = 0.95 95%CI: 0.94-0.95; P < 0.0001); abdominal pain (OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.08-1.96); P = 0.01) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.04-2.03; P = 0.02) as indications for the procedure; difficult procedure as defined by gastroenterologist (OR = 1.73, 95%CI: 1.48-2.03; P < 0.0001); past history of abdominal surgery (OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.17-1.52; P <0.0001) and previous colonoscopy (OR = 1.39, 95%CI: 1.21-1.60; P = 0.0001) and alcohol use (OR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.03-1.54; P = 0.02).

Our prediction model using the following pre-procedural variables including age, gender, indication for the procedure, medication/substance use, previous surgeries, previous high sedation requirements for colonoscopy yielded an area under the curve of 0.76 for Fentanyl \u2265 100 mcg and Midazolam \u2265 3 mg.", 
    "85": "Pre-procedural planning is the key in conducting successful, efficient colonoscopy. Logistic regression analysis of 5000 patients who underwent out-patient colonoscopy revealed the following factors associated with increased sedation requirement: Younger age, female gender, difficult endoscopy, specific indications as well as cardiopulmonary complications and current use of opioids/benzodiazepines. Age and gender adjusted analysis yielded similar results. These patients are more likely to need a longer recovery periods post-endoscopy, which could result in additional time and personnel requirements. The final predictive model has good predictive ability for Fentanyl \u2265 100 mcg and Midazolam \u2265 3 mg and fair predictive ability for Fentanyl \u2265 50 mcg and Midazolam \u2265 2 mg.

    "95": "Diazepam is a benzodiazepine receptor agonist with anxiolytic and addictive properties. Although most drugs of abuse increase the level of release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, here we show that diazepam not only causes the opposite effect but also prevents amphetamine from enhancing dopamine release. We used 20 min sampling in vivo microdialysis and subsecond fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings at carbon-fiber microelectrodes to show that diazepam caused a dose-dependent decrease in the level of tonic and electrically evoked dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of urethane-anesthetized adult male Swiss mice. In fast-scan cyclic voltammetry assays, dopamine release was evoked by electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area. We observed that 2 and 3 mg of diazepam/kg reduced the level of electrically evoked dopamine release, and this effect was reversed by administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil in doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, respectively. No significant effects on measures of dopamine re-uptake were observed. Cyclic voltammetry experiments further showed that amphetamine (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) caused a significant increase in the level of dopamine release and in the half-life for dopamine re-uptake. Diazepam (2 mg/kg) significantly weakened the effect of amphetamine on dopamine release without affecting dopamine re-uptake. These results suggest that the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines have a dopaminergic component. In addition, our findings challenge the classic view that all drugs of abuse cause dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and suggest that benzodiazepines could be useful in the treatment of addiction to other drugs that increase the level of dopamine release, such as cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine.",

Memantine, a drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, acts as a partial uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of memantine as an adjunctive treatment to olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, patients with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV clinical criteria were selected. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either memantine (week 1:10 mg/day; weeks 2-6:20 mg/day) plus olanzapine (15-20\u2009mg/day) or olanzapine plus placebo. At baseline, no statistically significant difference regarding the mean total PANSS scores between treatment groups was found. Results showed that memantine significantly improved the positive and negative PANSS score in patients maintained on olanzapine after six weeks compared to olanzapine alone (P<0.001). Furthermore, female patients showed significantly better response than males, especially in positive PANSS score. No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms were observed.These findings indicate that olanzapine efficacy might be augmented with memantine. Furthermore, this effect is more remarkable in female patients with schizophrenia.",

The IOP was measured before (time 0 [baseline]) and 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after administration of drugs. RESULTS Mean \u00b1 SD IOP values were 2.58 \u00b1 0.87 mm Hg, 4.46 \u00b1 1.58 mm Hg, and 5.96 \u00b1 1.23 mm Hg at 7 am, 3 pm, and 11 pm, respectively. Mean baseline IOP was 6.25 \u00b1 0.28 mm Hg, 6.12 \u00b1 0.23 mm Hg, 5.75 \u00b1 0.64 mm Hg, 5.12 \u00b1 1.40 mm Hg, and 4.50 \u00b1 1.30 mm Hg for the ketamine, xylazine, diazepam, KD, and KX groups, respectively. A significant decrease in IOP, compared with baseline IOP, was detected in only the KX group at 30, 60, and 90 minutes after drug administration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Maximum IOP in Syrian hamsters was detected at night. The ketamine-xylazine anesthetic combination significantly decreased IOP in Syrian hamsters.",

Both human and animal data indicate that the longer a seizure lasts, the less likely it is to stop. Recent evidence suggests that there is a critical transition from an ictal to a post-ictal state, associated with a transition from a spatio-temporally desynchronized state to a highly synchronized state, respectively. As SE continues, it becomes progressively resistant to drugs, in particular benzodiazepines due partly to NMDA receptor-dependent internalization of GABA(A) receptors. Moreover, excessive calcium entry into neurons through excessive NMDA receptor activation results in activation of nitric oxide synthase, calpains, and NADPH oxidase. The latter enzyme plays a critical part in the generation of seizure-dependent reactive oxygen species. Calcium also accumulates in mitochondria resulting in mitochondrial failure (decreased ATP production), and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Together these changes result in status epilepticus-dependent neuronal death via several pathways. Multiple downstream mechanisms including inflammation, break down of the blood-brain barrier, and changes in gene expression can contribute to later pathological processes including chronic epilepsy and cognitive decline.",

Increased TSPO expression is also prominent in several cancerous tissues where it appears to correlate with the degree of malignancy. Currently, TSPO is thus actively investigated as a generic biomarker for disease activity and a therapeutic target for a wide range of diseases. In this study, we report a Jurkat human T cell leukemia cell line that has only trace expression of TSPO mRNA. Through the use of bisulphite genomic sequencing, we show that the Jurkat TSPO promoter is highly methylated except for CpG sites that are adjacent to the transcription start site. Control measurements in HEK-293, HeLa, and U87-MG cells with high TSPO mRNA expression showed low levels of TSPO promoter methylation. Demethylation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) caused a dose-dependent increase in TSPO mRNA with a corresponding demethylation of the TSPO promoter in Jurkat cells. Treating HeLa and U87-MG cells with 5-aza-dC caused no change in the level of TSPO mRNA. These observations confirm the epigenetic regulation of TSPO and suggest it to be a more common mechanism by which the differential expression of TSPO in various cell types and in health and disease may be explained.",

    "158": "Objectives-This report identifies the specific drugs most frequently involved in drug overdose deaths in the United States from 2010 through 2014. Methods-The 2010-2014 National Vital Statistics System mortality files were linked to electronic files containing literal text information from death certificates. Drug overdose was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision underlying cause-of-death codes X40-X44 (unintentional), X60-X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10-Y14 (undetermined intent). Among deaths with an underlying cause of death of drug overdose, the literal text in three fields of the death certificate (i.e., the cause of death from Part I, significant conditions contributing to death from Part II, and a description of how the injury occurred from Box 43) were searched to identify drug mentions. Search term lists were developed using existing drug classification systems as well as from manual review of the literal text. The search term list was then used to identify the specific drugs involved in overdose deaths. Descriptive statistics were reported for drug overdose deaths involving the 10 most frequently mentioned drugs on death certificates. Tables and figures presenting information on the specific drugs involved in deaths are based on deaths with mention of at least one specific drug on the death certificate. Results-From 2010 through 2014, the number of drug overdose deaths per year increased 23%, from 38,329 in 2010 to 47,055 in 2014. During this time period, the percentage of drug overdose deaths involving at least one specific drug increased, from 67% in 2010 to 78% in 2014. Among drug overdose deaths with at least one drug specified on the death certificate, the 10 drugs most frequently involved in overdose deaths included the following opioids: heroin, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl; the following benzodiazepines: alprazolam and diazepam; and the following stimulants: cocaine and methamphetamine. During this 5-year period, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving heroin more than tripled, and the rate of drug overdose deaths involving methamphetamine more than doubled. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl more than doubled in a single year (from 2013 to 2014). In 2014, of the 36,667 drug overdose deaths involving at least one specific drug, 52% of these deaths specified one drug, 38% specified two or three drugs, and 11% specified four or more drugs. Conclusions-Analysis of the literal text from death certificates can be used to identify patterns in the specific drugs most frequently involved in drug overdose deaths. From 2010 through 2014, the top 10 drugs involved were the same, but the relative ranking and age-adjusted rates for deaths involving these drugs changed. Literal text analysis also revealed that many drug overdose deaths involved multiple drugs. Findings should be interpreted in light of the improvement in the quality of the data that resulted from better reporting of specific drugs on death certificates from 2010 through 2014. Relative increases in the death rates involving specific drugs and the rankings of these drugs may be affected by improvements in reporting, real increases in the numbers of death, or both.",

    "160": "This was a secondary analysis of the efficacy and safety results of the Pediatric Seizure Study, a randomized clinical trial of lorazepam versus diazepam for pediatric status epilepticus. We included the published results from the only prospective pediatric study of status in a Bayesian hierarchic model, and we performed sensitivity analyses on the amount of pooling between studies. We evaluated 3 summary analyses for the results: superiority, noninferiority (margin\u00a0<-10%), and practical equivalence (within \u00b110%).", 
    "161": "Consistent with the original study's classic analysis of study results, we did not demonstrate superiority of lorazepam over diazepam. There is a 95% probability that the true efficacy of lorazepam is in the range of 66% to 80%. For both the efficacy and safety outcomes, there was greater than 95% probability that lorazepam is noninferior to diazepam, and there was greater than 90% probability that the 2 medications are practically equivalent. The results were largely driven by the current study because of the sample sizes of our study (n=273) and the previous pediatric study (n=61).",

    "163": "There are currently no effective pharmacological agents available to stop or prevent the progression of Huntington's disease (HD), a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. In addition to psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairments, HD causes progressive motor disturbances, in particular choreiform movements, which are characterized by unwanted contractions of the facial muscles, trunk and extremities. Management of choreiform movements is usually advised if chorea interferes with daily functioning, causes social isolation, gait instability, falls, or physical injury. Although drugs to reduce chorea are available, only few randomized controlled studies have assessed the efficacy of these drugs, resulting in a high variety of prescribed drugs in clinical practice. The current pharmacological treatment options to reduce chorea in HD are outlined in this review, including the latest results on deutetrabenazine, a newly developed pharmacological agent similar to tetrabenazine, but with suggested less peak dose side effects. A review of the existing literature was conducted using the PubMed, Cochrane and Medline databases. In conclusion, mainly tetrabenazine, tiapride (in European countries), olanzapine, and risperidone are the preferred first choice drugs to reduce chorea among HD experts. In the existing literature, these drugs also show a beneficial effect on motor symptom severity and improvement of psychiatric symptoms. Generally, it is recommended to start with a low dose and increase the dose with close monitoring of any adverse effects. New interesting agents, such as deutetrabenazine and pridopidine, are currently under development and more randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the efficacy on chorea severity in HD.", 
    "164": "Fatal anaphylaxis is uncommon but not rare. Extrapolated mortality rates are 0.52% of total anaphylaxis patients Bock et al. (Jan. 2001) [1]. Nevertheless, compared with the incidence of the other cardiac arrest events, the incidence of cardiac arrest due to anaphylaxis is relatively small. As a result, the effect using targeted temperature management after anaphylaxis is not clearly understood. We report the case of a 63-year-old man who developed cardiac arrest after ingestion of two pieces of peach. He was resuscitated and his circulation returned spontaneously after approximately 11min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but he was unresponsive and had fixed dilated pupils. We initiated therapeutic hypothermia on the basis of protocol for 24h. The patient was gradually and successfully cooled and rewarmed. The patient opened his eyes spontaneously on day 5, obeyed commands on day 6, and was discharged on day 18. At the time of discharge, he had no neurologic deficiencies or other complications.", 
    "165": "Chronic pain patients present with cortical gray matter alterations, observed with anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Reduced regional gray matter volumes are often interpreted to reflect neurodegeneration, but studies investigating the cellular origin of gray matter changes are lacking. We used multimodal imaging to compare 26 postmenopausal women with fibromyalgia with 25 healthy controls (age range: 50-75 years) to test whether regional gray matter volume decreases in chronic pain are associated with compromised neuronal integrity. Regional gray matter decreases were largely explained by T1 relaxation times in gray matter, a surrogate measure of water content, and not to any substantial degree by GABAA receptor concentration, an indirect marker of neuronal integrity measured with [(18)F] flumazenil PET. In addition, the MR spectroscopy marker of neuronal viability, N-acetylaspartate, did not differ between patients and controls. These findings suggest that decreased gray matter volumes are not explained by compromised neuronal integrity. Alternatively, a decrease in neuronal matter could be compensated for by an upregulation of GABAA receptors. The relation between regional gray matter and T1 relaxation times suggests decreased tissue water content underlying regional gray matter decreases. In contrast, regional gray matter increases were explained by GABAA receptor concentration in addition to T1 relaxation times, indicating perhaps increased neuronal matter or GABAA receptor upregulation and inflammatory edema. By providing information on the histological origins of cerebral gray matter alterations in fibromyalgia, this study advances the understanding of the neurobiology of chronic widespread pain.", 
    "166": "Regional gray matter alterations in chronic pain, as detected with voxel-based morphometry of anatomical magnetic resonance images, are commonly interpreted to reflect neurodegeneration, but this assumption has not been tested. We found decreased gray matter in fibromyalgia to be associated with T1 relaxation times, a surrogate marker of water content, but not with GABAA receptor concentration, a surrogate of neuronal integrity. In contrast, regional gray matter increases were partly explained by GABAA receptor concentration, indicating some form of neuronal plasticity. The study emphasizes that voxel-based morphometry is an exploratory measure, demonstrating the need to investigate the histological origin of gray matter alterations for every distinct clinical entity, and advances the understanding of the neurobiology of chronic (widespread) pain.", 
    "167": "There is growing evidence that opioid prescribing in the United States follows a pattern in which patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes from opioids are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy. These patients include, in particular, those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and other psychiatric conditions. This study examined health insurance claims among 10,311,961 patients who filled prescriptions for opioids. Specifically, we evaluated how opioid receipt differed among patients with and without a wide range of preexisting psychiatric and behavioral conditions (ie, opioid and nonopioid SUDs, suicide attempts or other self-injury, motor vehicle crashes, and depressive, anxiety, and sleep disorders) and psychoactive medications (ie, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and medications used for SUD, tobacco cessation, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Relative to those without, patients with all assessed psychiatric conditions and medications had modestly greater odds of subsequently filling prescriptions for opioids and, in particular, substantially greater risk of long-term opioid receipt. Increases in risk for long-term opioid receipt in adjusted Cox regressions ranged from approximately 1.5-fold for prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication prescriptions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-1.58) to approximately 3-fold for prior nonopioid SUD diagnoses (HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 3.06-3.24) and nearly 9-fold for prior opioid use disorder diagnoses (HR = 8.70; 95% CI, 8.20-9.24). In sum, we found evidence of greater opioid receipt among commercially insured patients with a breadth of psychiatric conditions. Future studies assessing behavioral outcomes associated with opioid prescribing should consider preexisting psychiatric conditions.",

Antipsychotics used immediately after hospitalization included haloperidol (70.4%), clozapine (11.3%), olanzapine (10.4%), and other second-generation antipsychotics (7.9%). Comparison of restraint characteristics favored immediate clozapine use with highly reduced rates of restraint (23% vs. 95.6%; P < 0.001) and significantly extended hours until restraint [(118, 24, 426 hours) vs. (3, 0.25, 48 hours); median; 25th, 75th percentile; P < 0.001] relative to the remaining cohort.

    "177": "Musical hallucination is a disorder of complex sound processing of instrumental music, songs, choirs, chants, etc. The underlying pathologies include moderate to severe acquired hearing loss (the auditory equivalent of Charles Bonnet syndrome), psychiatric illnesses (depression, schizophrenia), drug intoxication (benzodiazepines, salicylate, pentoxifylline, propranolol), traumatic lesions along the acoustic pathways, and epilepsy. The hallucinations are most likely to begin late in life; 70% of patients are women. Musical hallucination has no known specific therapy. Treating the underlying cause is the most effective approach; neuroleptic and antidepressant medications have only rarely succeeded.Musical hallucination in epilepsy typically presents as simple partial seizures originating in the lateral temporal cortex. To our knowledge, no formal report of musical hallucination in the interictal state has been published before. In contrast, other interictal psychotic features are a relatively common complication, especially in patients with long-standing drug-resistant epilepsy.We describe a 62-year-old woman with a long history of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy whose musical hallucination was solely interictal. We speculate on the possible link between temporal epilepsy and her hallucination. We hypothesize that, as a result of her epileptic activity-induced damage, an imbalance developed between the excitatory and inhibitory projections connecting the mesial temporal cortex to the other auditory structures. These structures may have generated hyperactivity in the lateral temporal cortex through a \"release\" mechanism that eventually resulted in musical hallucination.", 
    "178": "The classic high-dose narcotic-based cardiac anesthetic has been modified to facilitate a fast-track, rapid recovery in the intensive care unit (ICU). Postoperative sedation is consequently now an essential component in recovery of the patient undergoing cardiac surgery. It must facilitate the patient's unawareness of the environment as well as reduce the discomfort and anxiety caused by surgery, intubation, mechanical ventilation, suction, and physiotherapy. Benzodiazepines seem well suited for this role, but propofol, opioids, and dexmedetomidine are among other agents commonly used for sedation in the ICU. However, what is an ideal sedative for this application? When compared with benzodiazepine-based sedation regimens, nonbenzodiazepines have been associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Current sedation guidelines recommend avoiding benzodiazepine use in the ICU. However, there are no recommendations on which alternatives should be used. In postcardiac surgery patients, inotropes and vasoactive medications are often required because of the poor cardiac function. This makes sedation after cardiac surgery unique in comparison with the requirements for most other ICU patient populations. We reviewed the current literature to try to determine if 1 sedative regimen might be better than others; in particular, we compare outcomes of propofol and dexmedetomidine in postoperative sedation in the cardiac surgical ICU.", 
    "179": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine agonist that affects the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of malaise-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in rats. Our previous study suggested that the palatability-enhancing rather than amnesic effects of midazolam were responsible for impaired retrieval of conditioned aversion to palatable conditioned stimuli (CSs). However, it remains unclear whether this effect is opioid-dependent. In the present study, we examined the involvement of opioid signaling with the ability of peripheral midazolam administration to transiently impair CTA retrieval in mice. CTA was established by pairing 5mM saccharin ingestion (conditioned stimulus, CS) with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 0.15M lithium chloride (LiCl, 2% body weight) (unconditioned stimulus) for two consecutive days. Conditioned mice that received midazolam (1.5mg/kg, i.p.) before the first retention test consumed significantly more saccharin (CS) than conditioned mice that received vehicle (phosphate-buffered physiological saline, PBS; i.p.). On the next day, both conditioned groups showed strong aversions to the CS. Next, naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, was peripherally administered prior to the midazolam injection before the retention test. Pre-administration of naloxone but not PBS attenuated midazolam-induced increases in CS intake. Finally, we examined aversive orofacial taste reactions (TRs) to an oral infusion of the CS with pre-administration of naloxone or PBS prior to midazolam using a taste reactivity test. Conditioned mice that received midazolam showed significantly longer latencies to express aversive orofacial TRs than those that received PBS. Pre-administration of naloxone eliminated the effect of midazolam on latency to express aversive TRs. Taken together, these data suggest that midazolam activates opioidergic transmission and opioid-dependent palatability enhancement of the CS to eliminate conditioned aversion to a sweet taste.",

Therefore, aquatic organisms are frequently exposed to a broad diversity of pharmaceuticals. Freshwater snail Radix balthica has been chosen as model to study the effects of oxazepam (psychotropic drug) on developmental stages ranging from trochophore to hatching. In order to provide a global insight of these effects, a transcriptome deep sequencing has been performed on exposed embryos. Eighteen libraries were sequenced, six libraries for three conditions: control, exposed to the lowest oxazepam concentration with a phenotypic effect (delayed hatching) (TA) and exposed to oxazepam concentration found in freshwater (TB). A total of 39,759,772 filtered raw reads were assembled into 56,435 contigs having a mean length of 1579.68 bp and mean depth of 378.96 reads. 44.91% of the contigs have at least one annotation. The differential expression analysis between the control condition and the two exposure conditions revealed 146 contigs differentially expressed of which 144 for TA and two for TB. 34.0% were annotated with biological function. There were four mainly impacted processes: two cellular signalling systems (Notch and JNK) and two biosynthesis pathways (Polyamine and Catecholamine pathways).

In terms of adverse effects, we found no statistically significant differences between the two drugs for either airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.55, low-quality evidence) or respiratory hypoxia (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.03, moderate-quality evidence) - but use of midazolam did result in three people (out of around 70) needing some sort of 'airway management' with no such events in the droperidol group. There were no data for mental state, service use and costs.Furthermore, when droperidol was compared to olanzapine, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by any time point, we found no clear differences between the older drug (droperidol) and olanzapine (e.g. at 30 minutes: 1 RCT, N = 221, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11, high-quality evidence). There was a suggestion that participants allocated droperidol needed less additional medication after 60 minutes than people given the olanzapine (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87, high-quality evidence). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88, moderate-quality evidence) and respiratory airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.72, low-quality evidence) than olanzapine. For 'being ready for discharge', there was no difference between groups (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.34, high-quality evidence). There were no data for mental state and costs.", 
    "201": "Previously, the use of droperidol was justified based on experience rather than evidence from well-conducted and reported randomised trials. However, this update found high-quality evidence with minimal risk of bias to support the use of droperidol for acute psychosis. Also, we found no evidence to suggest that droperidol should not be a treatment option for people acutely ill and disturbed because of serious mental illnesses.", 
    "202": "Eszopiclone is a benzodiazepine-like hypnotic that is commonly prescribed to treat insomnia. However, eszopiclone's efficacy has been questionable in several clinical trials, and its pharmacologic profile makes its effects on sleep and behavior difficult to predict. We report a case demonstrating an instance of eszopiclone-induced parasomnia involving paranoia and a suicide attempt in a patient taking eszopiclone. We explore possible biochemical explanations examining the pharmacologic profile of eszopiclone and its potential for drug-drug interactions, especially with concomitant administration of monoaminergic medications such as antidepressants. Caution should be exercised when prescribing these medications, and evidence-based treatments for insomnia (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, sedating antidepressants) should be considered prior to sedative-hypnotic administration.", 
    "203": "Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine cause metabolic side effects leading to obesity and insulin resistance. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study we investigated the effects of chronic treatment of olanzapine on the fatty acid composition of plasma in mice.", 
    "204": "Twenty 8-week female Balb/c mice were randomly assigned to two groups: the OLA group and the control group. After treatment with olanzapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle intraperitoneally for 8 weeks, fasting glucose, insulin levels and oral glucose tolerance test were determined. Effects on plasma fatty acid profile and plasma indices of D5 desaturase, D6 desaturase and SCD1 activity were also investigated.", 
    "205": "Chronic administration of olanzapine significantly elevated fasting glucose and insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance, but did not increase body weight. Total saturated fatty acids and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were significantly increased and total monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly decreased, while total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids showed no prominent changes. Chronic olanzapine treatment significantly up-regulated D6 desaturase activity while down-regulating D5 desaturase activity. Palmitic acid (C16:0), dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6) and D6 desaturase were associated with an increase probability of insulin resistance, whereas nervonic acid (C24:1) and SCD1 were significantly associated with a lower insulin resistance probability.", 
    "206": "All results indicated that such drug-induced effects on fatty acid profile in plasma were relevant for the metabolic adverse effects associated with olanzapine and possibly other antipsychotics. Further studies are needed to investigate geneticand other mechanisms to explain how plasma fatty acids regulate glucose metabolism and affect the risk of insulin resistance.", 
    "207": "Personality disorders, violence and criminal behaviour The importance of personality disorders for violent and criminal behaviour is illustrated by their high prevalence in prison populations. Especially antisocial personality disorder and antisocial personality traits are linked to violence. During diagnostic assessment of personality disorders, violence risk screening is recommended. Cognitive behaviour treatment focused on violent behaviour has some effect in criminal populations, but the antisocial personality traits are resistant to treatment. Evidence for pharmacological treatment of repetitive aggressive behaviour is weak. But, bensodiazepines seem to increase the risk of violent behaviour among patients with personality disorders. Antisocial personality traits diminish over time. This spontaneous decrease can be delayed by comorbidity such as other personality disorder, substance use disorder, psychosis and attention deficit disorders. Therefore it is recommended to actively treat these comorbid conditions.", 
    "208": "Midazolam is an anesthetic agent commonly used during clinical and surgical procedures, which has been shown to exert ROS\u2011suppressing and apoptosis\u2011modulating pharmacological activities in various cellular systems. However, the effects of midazolam on oxidative stress in neuronal cells require elucidation. The present study investigated the effects of midazolam on buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)\u2011 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)\u2011induced oxidative stress in primary cortical neuronal cells. In addition, the effects of midazolam on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and on ethanol\u2011induced neuroapoptosis in the brains of neonatal mice were determined. Subsequently, cell viability was detected using the MTT assay; intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined using the 2',7'\u2011dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate method with confocal microscopy; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was conducted to detect apoptotic cells; immunohistochemistry was performed to detect activated caspase\u20113; neuronal deficit and infarct volume analyses were conducted; and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect the expression levels of genes and proteins associated with apoptosis and cell survival pathways. The results demonstrated that BSO (10\u00a0mM) and H2O2 (1\u00a0mM) suppressed proliferation of cortical neuronal cells by inducing apoptosis. These effects were suppressed following treatment with midazolam in a dose\u2011dependent manner. In addition, BSO and H2O2 induced ROS generation in neuronal cells; however, this was effectively suppressed by midazolam (100\u00a0\u00b5M). Beneficial synergistic effects were detected when midazolam was used in combination with the known antioxidant trolox. BSO and H2O2 also suppressed the protein expression levels of c\u2011Jun N\u2011terminal kinases (JNK), phosphorylated (p)JNK, extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinases (ERK)1/2, pERK1/2, AKT and nuclear factor\u2011\u03baB; however, expression was recovered following treatment with midazolam. Midazolam also activated protein kinase\u00a0C\u2011\u03b5, which was suppressed by BSO, in cortical neuronal cells. In MCAO mice, midazolam post\u2011conditioning significantly suppressed infarct size and reduced the number of TUNEL\u2011positive cells. In addition, the expression levels of caspase\u20113 and poly (ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase were suppressed in a dose\u2011dependent manner. In neonatal mice, midazolam reduced ethanol\u2011induced activated caspase\u20113 staining and apoptotic TUNEL staining. The results of the present study demonstrated that midazolam may protect against neuronal degeneration and neuroapoptosis induced by physiological and oxidative stress.", 
    "209": "Acute hyperkinesia after discontinuation of tramadol in a patient with chronic pain using citalopram and pramipexole for restless legs syndrome (RLS) has not been reported. An 81-year-old female was admitted for increasing hyperkinesias of the whole body after she had discontinued tramadol 300 mg (taken during 3 months) without tapering 4 days earlier. In addition, she was on treatment with pramipexole (0.18 mg) for RLS for years, citalopram 10 mg/day for ~4 years, and fentanyl 75 \u03bcg/day for 1 year. Hyperkinesias did not respond to benzodiazepines, quetiapine, biperiden, or valproic acid. Surprisingly, hyperkinetic bursts resolved immediately upon 15 mg fentanyl intravenously. Obviously, tramadol withdrawal had enhanced the preexisting RLS. Overdosing of pramipexole or serotonin syndrome was excluded. Sudden discontinuation of tramadol in a patient under pramipexole for RLS may cause severe, choreatic hyperkinesias for hours, which immediately resolve upon intravenous fentanyl. In patients under pramipexole for RLS and tramadol and fentanyl for chronic pain, sudden discontinuation of tramadol should be avoided to prevent induction of restless body syndrome.", 
    "210": "The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of sleep disturbances and possible correlations with associated factors in a sample of patients admitted to an acute palliative/supportive care unit.A consecutive sample of patients with advanced cancer was prospectively assessed for a period of 6\u00a0months. Epidemiological and clinical data, treatments received in the last month, Karnofsky status, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), and concomitant medical treatment were also recorded. Patients were administered the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and the Hospital Anxiety and depression scale (HADS).Two hundred nineteen patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65.4\u00a0years (SD 12.4), and 111 patients were males. The mean Karnofsky status was 46.6 (SD\u00a0=\u00a012). All patients had consistent sleep disturbances (AIS \u22656), with a large number of patients having intense-maximum sleep disturbances. No relationships of AIS with gender, age, primary diagnosis, socio-educational factors, and anticancer treatments were found. AIS score was significantly associated with Karnofsky; intensities of pain, asthenia, anorexia, anxiety, depression, drowsiness, and well-being; and the use of corticosteroids and benzodiazepines. There was a positive correlation of HADS anxiety and HADS depression with sleep disturbances (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000). In the multivariate analysis, AIS increased only with the level of anxiety and depression assessed by HADS.Sleep disturbances were ubiquitous in advanced cancer patients admitted to a supportive/palliative care unit and were strongly correlated with psychological distress. Assessment of sleep disorders is mandatory in this population for the obvious interference with quality of life.", 
    "211": "Benzodiazepines should be prescribed on a short-term basis, but a significant proportion of patients (%) use them for more than 6 months, constituting a serious public health issue. Indeed, few strategies are effective in helping patients to discontinue long-term benzodiazepine treatments. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and the impact of a program including cognitive behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, and balneotherapy in a spa resort to facilitate long-term discontinuation of benzodiazepines. We conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study. Patients with long-term benzodiazepine use were recruited with the aim of anxiolytic withdrawal by means of a psychoeducational program and daily balneotherapy during 3 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome measure was benzodiazepine use 6 months after the program, compared to use at baseline. A total of 70 subjects were enrolled. At 6 months, overall benzodiazepine intake had decreased by 75.3%, with 41.4% of patients completely stopping benzodiazepine use. The results also suggest a significantly greater improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms among patients who discontinued benzodiazepines compared to patients who only reduced their use. Our findings suggest that balneotherapy in association with a psychoeducative program is efficient in subjects with benzodiazepine addiction.", 
    "212": "Benzodiazepines represent the first-line treatment for the acute management of epileptic seizures and status epilepticus. The emergency use of benzodiazepines must be timely, and because most seizures occur outside of the hospital environment, there is a significant need for delivery methods that are easy for nonclinical caregivers to use and administer quickly and safely. In addition, the ideal route of administration should be reliable in terms of absorption. Rectal diazepam is the only licensed formulation in the USA, whereas rectal diazepam and buccal midazolam are currently licensed in the EU. However, the sometimes unpredictable absorption with rectal and buccal administration means they are not ideal routes. Several alternative routes are currently being explored. This is a narrative review of data about delivery methods for benzodiazepines alternative to the intravenous and oral routes for the acute treatment of seizures. Unconventional delivery options such as direct delivery to the central nervous system or inhalers are reported. Data show that intranasal diazepam or midazolam and the intramuscular auto-injector for midazolam are as effective as rectal or intravenous diazepam. Head-to-head comparisons with buccal midazolam are urgently needed. In addition, the majority of trials focused on children and adolescents, and further trials in adults are warranted.",

Significant hypercapnia occurred more frequently during anesthetic conserving device use (6.4% vs 0%; p = 0.021).", 
    "219": "Volatile sedation is feasible in cardiac arrest survivors. Prospective controlled studies are necessary to confirm the beneficial effects on duration of ventilation and length of ICU stay observed in our study. Our data argue against a major effect on neurologic outcome. Close monitoring of PaCO2 is necessary during sedation via anesthetic conserving device.",

Lack of adherence to recommended care was associated with a greater than twofold increased risk of intubation (relative risk 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.13) and 1.5-fold increased risk of admission to the ICU (relative risk 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-2.16). Duration of ventilation was commonly <24 hours (87%) for patients who did or did not receive recommended acute seizure care. Among events treated initially with a benzodiazepine, only 32% received a recommended weight-based dosage, and underdosing was most common.",

She developed worsening mental status and was then treated for catatonia with benzodiazepines. Over 2\u00a0days, her mental status continued to worsen and she developed fever and tachycardia. She was transferred to the ICU and endotracheally intubated for inability to protect her airway.

Due to limited success and application of screening approaches in this cohort, older adults are more likely to present to general hospital settings with undiagnosed problematic alcohol use. Consultation-liaison psychiatry services operating in general hospital settings are likely to be referred older adults with alcohol use disorders for assessment and management. A 77-year-old female presented to a metropolitan hospital with symptoms including frequent falls, slurred speech, difficulty judging distance, hypersomnia, poor reasoning, and odd behaviours. She also presented with severe anxiety and bruxism. Several diagnostic tests were inconclusive, and a consultation-liaison psychiatry assessment revealed a prominent heavy drinking pattern and concurrent abuse of oxycodone and benzodiazepines. This report adds further support to the case for uniform screening of all older adults for alcohol and other drug (AOD) use. A number of weeks had passed before the patient's drinking pattern was established, with no withdrawal management in place. A multifaceted treatment approach, including antidepressant therapy, anticraving medication, benzodiazepine as well as opiate rationalisation, and AOD counselling support was commenced prior to discharge from the general hospital.",

    "235": "Flubromazolam is a triazole benzodiazepine with high potency and long-lasting central nervous system depressant effects; however, limited data about its pharmacokinetics are available. Here, we report in vitro studies of the human flubromazolam metabolism analyzed by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). In vitro investigations were carried out in pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) and recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP)-enzymes. To confirm those metabolites detected in vitro, authentic samples obtained from two forensic cases were also analyzed by LC-HRMS. Additionally, determination of the unbound fraction of flubromazolam in pHLM and in plasma was performed by equilibrium dialysis with subsequent prediction of its hepatic clearance (CLH ) using well-stirred and parallel-tube models. Additional findings obtained by routine screening methods of these forensic cases are also reported. Studies using incubations with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-fortified pHLM with or without uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid and incubations with CYP-enzymes identified the main metabolic pathway of flubromazolam as hydroxylation on the \u03b1- and/or 4-position mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with subsequent glucuronidation of the hydroxylated metabolites as well as of the parent drug. Further, \u03b1-hydroxy-flubromazolam and its corresponding glucuronide were detected in vivo together with the N-glucuronide of flubromazolam. The predicted CLH of flubromazolam using the well-stirred and parallel-tube models were 0.42 and 0.43\u2009mL/min/kg, respectively. Based on the data presented here, flubromazolam is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4/5 with a high protein-binding and a predicted low clearance. Analysis of authentic samples suggested that analytical targets for flubromazolam should be the compound itself and \u03b1-hydroxy-flubromazolam."
