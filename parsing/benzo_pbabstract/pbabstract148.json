    "0": "Benzodiazepines are frequently encountered in forensic toxicology. A literature search was conducted to find a simple method using electron impact-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (EI-GC-MS) to examine whole blood specimens for the most commonly encountered benzodiazepines in the United States. A recently published method was identified in the literature search and used as a starting point for development of a new procedure to be used for routine analysis of forensic toxicology case samples. The procedure was then developed and validated as a rapid and efficient method for the screening and quantitation of benzodiazepines in blood using liquid-liquid extraction and EI-GC-MS in selective ion monitoring mode. Materials and instrumentation common to most forensic toxicology laboratories were utilized while obtaining LODs from 5 to 50 ng/mL and LOQs of 50 ng/mL or less using 1 mL of sample. Target compounds were chosen based on availability and common use in the United States and include diazepam, desalkylflurazepam, nordiazepam, midazolam, oxazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam (relative elution order). The linear range (r2 > 0.990) was validated from 50 to 1000 ng/mL for all analytes. The CV of replicate analyses at both 50 and 200 ng/mL was less than 4%. Quantitative accuracy was within +/- 16% at 50 ng/mL and within +/- 7% at 200 ng/mL. The validated method provides an efficient procedure for the quantitation of a broad range of the most common benzodiazepines in blood at meaningful limits of detection and quantitation using standard laboratory equipment and a small amount of sample.", 
    "1": "Postmortem drug concentrations may vary depending on sampling site, volume of blood collected, and method of sampling, making it important to analyze specimens from different sites in the body to detect postmortem redistribution and avoid erroneous conclusions on cause and manner of death. Using a blind stick method to draw large amounts of blood from the femoral vessel may increase the likelihood of contamination with blood from more central sites. It has been suggested that clamping the femoral vessel before drawing the sample may eliminate possible contribution from central sites. Eight drugs from four different drug classes were evaluated to determine the difference between drug concentrations in clamped and blind stick femoral blood. Drug concentrations of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram), two benzodiazepines (diazepam and alprazolam), two antihistamines (diphenhydramine and promethazine), and one opiate (hydrocodone) were evaluated in clamped femoral blood, blind stick femoral blood, and heart blood and compared using concentration ratios and linear regression analysis. Clamped femoral blood concentrations and blind stick femoral blood concentrations were found to have good predictability across all drug classes with ratios around 1.0, indicating good correlation between blind stick femoral and clamped femoral samples. Therefore, it can be concluded that a blind stick femoral blood sample does not have significant redistribution from central sites and is of equivalent quality to a clamped femoral sample.", 
    "2": "In a recent publication, the authors reported a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-time of flight procedure for the simultaneous analysis of 22 benzodiazepines in urine specimens. In this report, the list of benzodiazepines that could be analyzed was expanded to 35 benzodiazepines, and data for the additional 13 analytes are presented. The analysis focused on the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines and/or their metabolites. Using this method, the limit of quantitation for all benzodiazepines tested ranged from 0.1 to 10 ng/mL, and the limit of determination range was 0.03 to 3.0 ng/mL. The method was used for the analysis of 111 forensic/clinical samples previously tested for benzodiazepines by immunoassays (81 positives and 30 negatives). All immunoassay positive specimens were confirmed by this procedure for one or more analytes. However, only 12 out of the 35 benzodiazepines analyzed were detected in these specimens.", 
    "3": "Chronic pain patients are frequently maintained on one or more powerful opioid medications in combination with other psychoactive medications. Urine tests provide objective information regarding patient compliance status. Little information is available on testing this unique population. The goal of this study was to characterize drug disposition patterns in urine specimens collected from a large population of pain patients. Confirmation data for 10,922 positive specimens were collated into 11 drug Classes. The number of drug/metabolites tested (#) and number of confirmed positive specimens were as follows: amphetamines (7), 160; barbiturates (5), 308; benzodiazepines (6), 2397; cannabinoids (1), 967; carisoprodol (2), 611; cocaine (1), 310; fentanyl (1), 458; meperidine (2), 58; methadone (2), 1209; opiates (7), 8996; and propoxyphene (2), 385. Subdivision into 19 distinct drug Groups allowed characterization of drug use patterns. Of the 10,922 positive specimens, 15,859 results were reported as positive in various drug Classes, and 27,197 drug/metabolites were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The frequency of illicit drug use (cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy) was 10.8%. Being the first study of this type, these data present a large array of information on licit and illicit drug use, drug detection frequencies, drug/metabolite patterns, and multi-drug use combinations in pain patients.", 
    "4": "This manuscript discusses the results of studies that were performed to determine optimum capillary electrophoresis (CE) conditions for the enantiomeric resolution of twelve chiral analytes with eight amino acid based polymeric surfactants. The parameters that were optimized include pH, buffer type, and concentration of surfactant. The results indicated that the optimum conditions for enantiomeric separations with the amino acid based polymeric surfactants examined in this study using CE were analyte dependent, not surfactant dependent. In other words, the optimum conditions for a particular analyte were the same for all the amino acid based polymeric surfactants examined in this study. The results of these studies indicate that when using a large group of related amino acid based polymeric surfactants only a few surfactants need to be optimized for each analyte under study. These studies were limited to anionic surfactants that contain the amino acids glycine, L-alanine, L-valine, and L-leucine only. No inference can be necessarily drawn about surfactants containing other types of amino acids such as threonine and serine, which contain extra heteroatoms, or phenylalanine that has an aromatic moiety.", 
    "5": "The purpose of this research was to assess the anxiolytic properties of a phytochemically characterized commercial extract from Passiflora incarnata (PI; Passifloraceae) in the elevated plus maze test in mice. Using an HPLC method, the flavonoids homoorientin, orientin, vitexin, and isovitexin were identified as major compounds. Following oral administration, the extract exerted an anxiolytic effect that was comparable to diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) at a dose of 375 mg/kg and exhibited a U-shaped dose-response curve. In addition, antagonism studies using the GABA (A)/benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil and the 5-HT (1A)-receptor antagonist WAY-100 635 were conducted. The active dose was effectively antagonized by flumazenil, but not by WAY-100 635. This study is the first demonstration of the IN VIVO, GABA-mediated anxiolytic activity of an HPLC- characterized extract of Passiflora incarnata.", 
    "6": "Two hours after hatching (Day 0), groups of chicks from both sexes were housed either individually (IND) or socially in pairs (SOC) for 24 h. On Day 1, for each of the two conditions, half of the chicks were individually exposed to early novelty for 10 min, which comprised being placed in a novel-cage with small pebbles glued to the floor. The other half (controls) remained in the home-cage (IND-C and SOC-C). Thus, the IND-N group was exposed to early novelty, and the SOC-N+I group was exposed to early novelty and social isolation. Subsequently, all groups were mixed and socially reared until reaching 15 days of age. At this time, chicks were exposed to open field (OF) and tonic immobility (TI) tests. The IND-N group showed a shorter latency to ambulate in the OF test, shorter immobility duration in the TI test, a reduced plasma corticosterone concentration and increased flunitrazepam sensitive-GABA(A) receptor basal forebrain density compared with other groups, indicating that a neonatal novelty induced lower fearfulness in young chicks. In contrast, the effect of neonatal novelty was abolished by a simultaneous effect of social isolation in the SOC-N+I group. Thus, early post-hatch life events such as early novelty could improve a bird's later ability to cope with new stressful events. In addition, it is possible that both novelty and social isolation act on different neurobiological processes.", 
    "7": "Understanding effects of estrogen on the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) may help to elucidate the increased prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in women of ovarian cycling age. Estrogen replacement in ovariectomized (OVX) young rats amplifies the detrimental effects of stress on working memory (a PFC-mediated task), but the mechanisms by which this occurs have yet to be identified. In male rats, stimulation of norepinephrine alpha-2 adrenoceptors protects working memory from stress-induced impairments. However, this effect has not been studied in females, and has not been examined for sensitivity to estrogen. The current study asked whether OVX females with estrogen replacement (OVX+Est) and without replacement (OVX+Veh) responded differently to stimulation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors after administration of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG7142, a pharmacological stressor. The alpha-2 agonist, guanfacine, protected working memory from the impairing effects of FG7142 in OVX+Veh, but not in OVX+Est rats. Western Blot analysis for alpha-2 receptors was performed on PFC tissue from each group, but no changes in expression were found, indicating that the behavioral effects observed were likely not due to changes in receptor expression. These findings point to possible mechanisms by which estrogen may enhance the stress response, and hold implications for the gender discrepancy in the prevalence of stress-related mental illness.", 
    "8": "Ethanol alters the distribution and abundance of PKCdelta in neural cell lines. Here we investigated whether PKCdelta also regulates behavioral responses to ethanol. PKCdelta(-/-) mice showed reduced intoxication when administered ethanol and reduced ataxia when administered the nonselective GABA(A) receptor agonists pentobarbital and pregnanolone. However, their response to flunitrazepam was not altered, suggesting that PKCdelta regulates benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA(A) receptors, most of which contain delta subunits and mediate tonic inhibitory currents in neurons. Indeed, the distribution of PKCdelta overlapped with GABA(A) delta subunits in thalamus and hippocampus, and ethanol failed to enhance tonic GABA currents in PKCdelta(-/-) thalamic and hippocampal neurons. Moreover, using an ATP analog-sensitive PKCdelta mutant in mouse L(tk(-)) fibroblasts that express alpha4beta3delta GABA(A) receptors, we found that ethanol enhancement of GABA currents was PKCdelta-dependent. Thus, PKCdelta enhances ethanol intoxication partly through regulation of GABA(A) receptors that contain delta subunits and mediate tonic inhibitory currents. These findings indicate that PKCdelta contributes to a high level of behavioral response to ethanol, which is negatively associated with risk of developing an alcohol use disorder in humans.", 
    "9": "Cytochrome P450 3A4 is the predominant isoform in liver, and it metabolizes more than 50% of the clinical drugs commonly used. However, CYP3A4 is also responsible for metabolic activation of drugs, leading to liver injury. Benzodiazepines are widely used as hypnotics and sedatives for anxiety, but some of them induce liver injury in humans. To clarify whether benzodiazepines are metabolically activated, 14 benzodiazepines were investigated for their cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells treated with recombinant CYP3A4. By exposure to 100 microM flunitrazepam, nimetazepam, or nitrazepam, the cell viability in the presence of CYP3A4 decreased more than 25% compared with that of the control. In contrast, in the case of other benzodiazepines, the changes in the cell viability between CYP3A4 and control Supersomes were less than 10%. These results suggested that nitrobenzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam, nimetazepam, and nitrazepam were metabolically activated by CYP3A4, which resulted in cytotoxicity. To identify the reactive metabolite, the glutathione adducts of flunitrazepam and nimetazepam were investigated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The structural analysis for the glutathione adducts of flunitrazepam indicated that a nitrogen atom in the side chain of flunitrazepam was conjugated with the thiol of glutathione. Therefore, the presence of a nitro group in the side chain of benzodiazepines may play a crucial role in the metabolic activation by CYP3A4. The present study suggested that metabolic activation by CYP3A4 was one of the mechanisms of liver injury by nitrobenzodiazepines.", 
    "10": "In this study, midazolam was used as a probe-sensitive CYP3A substrate to investigate the effect of anacetrapib on CYP3A activity, and ketoconazole was used as a probe-inhibitor to investigate the effect of potent CYP3A inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of anacetrapib, a novel cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor in development for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Two partially blinded, randomized, 2-period, fixed-sequence studies were performed. Safety, tolerability, and midazolam and anacetrapib plasma concentrations were assessed. All treatments were generally well tolerated. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of midazolam with anacetrapib/midazolam alone for AUC0-infinity and Cmax were 1.04 (0.94, 1.14) and 1.15 (0.97, 1.37), respectively. Exposure to anacetrapib was increased by ketoconazole--specifically, the geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of anacetrapib with ketoconazole/anacetrapib alone for AUC0-infinity and Cmax were 4.58 (3.68, 5.71) and 2.37 (2.02, 2.78), respectively. The study showed that anacetrapib does not inhibit or induce CYP3A activity. Furthermore, anacetrapib appears to be a moderately sensitive substrate of CYP3A.", 
    "11": "The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is caused by many disease-relevant conditions, inducing conserved signaling events collectively known as the unfolded protein response. When ER stress is excessive or prolonged, cell death (usually occurring by apoptosis) is triggered. We undertook a chemical biology approach for investigating mechanisms of ER stress-induced cell death. Using a cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify compounds that rescued a neuronal cell line from thapsigargin-induced cell death, we identified benzodiazepinones that selectively inhibit cell death caused by inducers of ER stress (thapsigargin and tunicamycin) but not by inducers of extrinsic (tumor necrosis factor) or intrinsic (mitochondrial) cell death pathways. The compounds displayed activity in several cell lines and primary cultured neurons. Mechanism of action studies revealed that these compounds inhibit ER stress-induced activation of p38 MAPK and kinases responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation. Active benzodiazepinones suppressed cell death at the level of apoptotic signal kinase-1 (ASK1) within the IRE1 pathway but without directly inhibiting the kinase activity of ASK1 or >400 other kinases tested. Rather, active compounds enhanced phosphorylation of serine 967 of ASK1, promoting ASK1 binding to 14-3-3, an event associated with suppression of ASK1 function. Reducing ASK1 protein expression using small interfering RNA also protected cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis, confirming the importance of this protein kinase. Taken together, these findings demonstrate an essential role for ASK1 in cell death induced by ER stress. The compounds identified may prove useful for revealing endogenous mechanisms that regulate inhibitory phosphorylation of ASK1.", 
    "12": "Traditional cardiac risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension and obesity, are widely accepted contributors to the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the foremost causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Largely overlooked, however, is the impact of mental health on cardiac disease. From extensive MEDLINE and PsycINFO searches, we have reviewed the association between specific psychiatric disorders and CVD-related morbidity and mortality, the efficacy and safety of their treatments, and plausible behavioral and biological mechanism through which these associations may occur. The preponderance of evidence suggests that depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are all important cardiac risk factors, and patients with these disorders are at significantly higher risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality than are their counterparts in the general population. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines are effective therapeutic interventions, and many are safe to use in cardiac populations. Some, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics, may even improve cardiac outcomes in healthy individuals and patients with CVD, although more work is needed to confirm this hypothesis. A combination of behavioral and biological mechanisms underlies the association between cardiac disease and mental illness, many of which are shared across disorders. With further research, it may be learned that psychiatric treatments definitively reverse the detrimental effects of mental illness on cardiac health. Currently, however, the challenge lies in raising awareness of mental health issues in cardiac patients, so that basic but critical treatments may be initiated in this population.", 
    "13": "A simple, sensitive, selective, and reproducible RP-HPLC method with DAD detection at 240 nm was developed for the determination of six 1,4-benzodiazepines: bromazepam (BRZ), clonazepam (CLZ), diazepam (DZP), flunitrazepam (FNZ), lorazepam (LRZ), alprazolam (APZ); and two metabolites: alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (HALZ) and alpha-hydroxytriazolam (HTZL) in human plasma, urine, and saliva, using colchicine as internal standard, after SPE using Nexus Varian cartridges. Separation was performed on a Kromasil C(8) (250 mm x 5 mm, 5 microm) analytical column with a gradient mobile phase containing methanol, ACN and 0.05 M ammonium acetate. Linearity was held within the range 0.3-20.0 ng/microL, with coefficients of determination (r(2)) better than 0.997. The within- and between-day assay RSD at 2, 4, 8 ng/microL ranged from 0.03 to 4.7% and 0.5 to 7.0%, respectively in standards, from 1.3 to 7.9% and 3.3 to 7.3%, respectively in plasma, from 2.1 to 6.0% and 2.1 to 7.8%, respectively in urine and at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 ng/microL ranged from 2.22 to 5.8% and 2.2 to 8.1%, respectively, in saliva. The mean relative recoveries were 96.3-108.6, 96.0-108.2, 94.3-107.1, 97.0-107.0% in within-day assay and 96.8-107.7, 94.6-107.6, 93.2-105.8, 96.0-108.6 in between-day assay for standard, plasma, urine, and saliva, respectively. The LOD and LOQ were 0.02-0.47 and 0.07-1.57 ng/microL, respectively.",

A 22-year-old drug-abuser injected flunitrazepam tablets dissolved in tap water into her left femoral artery and presented with clinical signs of acute ischaemia of the left leg. Severe rhabdomyolysis developed within 5 hours after the injection. Selective arterial catheter angiography showed an acute occlusion of the posterior tibial artery. Combination therapy with i.a. urokinase, i.a. prostaglandines and i.v. anticoagulation resulted in re-opening of the obstructed distal artery and complete cessation of symptoms.",

She rapidly developed coma and abdominal distension leading to multiple organ failure. Subsequent surgical evaluation revealed abdominal perforation and necrosis, and life-sustaining treatments were therefore withdrawn.", 
    "17": "This is a primary ACS that can be explained from experimental data on the pathophysiology of pneumatosis cystoides coli. For this case, we discuss multiple etiological factors for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAP), such as paralytic ileus and massive fluid resuscitation due to the direct toxicity of ingested trichlorethylene.",

    "23": "Olanzapine is widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and is considered a first line medication in India. Along with other factors, the variation in response and side effects to this agent may be accounted for by genetic differences among patients. Olanzapine was administered for 6 weeks to Indian subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV, n=130), as part of an open label study. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed, and 10 polymorphic markers from seven genes (dopamine D1, D2, D3 and D4 receptors, serotonin 2A receptor and the drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A2 and CYP2D6)), together with demographic and clinical variables, were analyzed as potential predictors of response. Olanzapine was efficacious, but significant weight gain was noted. Baseline weight and a 120 bp deletion polymorphism at the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene were associated with changes in symptom scores. Predictable covariates of treatment response were also noted. These results merit replicate studies.", 
    "24": "Sea urchin sperm have a single mitochondrion which, aside from its main ATP generating function, may regulate motility, intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and possibly the acrosome reaction (AR). We have found that acute application of agents that inhibit mitochondrial function via differing mechanisms (CCCP, a proton gradient uncoupler, antimycin, a respiratory chain inhibitor, oligomycin, a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor and CGP37157, a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor) increases [Ca(2+)](i) with at least two differing profiles. These increases depend on the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), which indicates they involve Ca(2+) uptake and not only mitochondrial Ca(2+) release. The plasma membrane permeation pathways activated by the mitochondrial inhibitors are permeable to Mn(2+). Store-operated Ca(2+) channel (SOC) blockers (Ni(2+), SKF96365 and Gd(2+)) and internal-store ATPase inhibitors (thapsigargin and bisphenol) antagonize Ca(2+) influx induced by the mitochondrial inhibitors. The results indicate that the functional status of the sea urchin sperm mitochondrion regulates Ca(2+) entry through SOCs. As neither CCCP nor dicycloexyl carbodiimide (DCCD), another mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, eliminate the oligomycin induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i), apparently oligomycin also has an extra mitochondrial target.",

    "27": "There were 566 drug poisoning (47%) with a cumulative incidence of 0.1%, in which women (62.3%) were found to predominate, and the average patient age was 42.46+/-19.97 years (range 14-100 years). In 64.31% of the cases (566), only one kind of drug was used, benzodiazepine being the most common. This appeared at least once in 62% of the cases. Furthermore, 83% were cases of voluntary poisoning. Of the involuntary poisonings, digoxin was the most common drug with a frequency of 58.4%. A total of 28.6% of the cases were admitted into hospital, while the total number of patients who suffered a relapse in this period was 10%.", 
    "28": "Voluntary drug intoxications are caused mostly by psychoactive drugs, likely due to a high prevalence of underlying psychiatric disease in these patients.

    "29": "We report here a novel observation that zolmitriptan induced CYP3A2 in male but not female rats. As part of our research programme to evaluate sex differences in the response to zolmitriptan, we studied the effects of zolmitriptan on CYP3A activity, protein and gene expression in male and female rats. Zolmitriptan was found to induce CYP3A activity, measured as testosterone and diazepam metabolism in-vitro, as well as midazolam pharmacokinetics in-vivo, in male but not female rats. The sex difference in response to zolmitriptan was further evaluated by analysis of CYP3A1/2 mRNA levels using real-time PCR, and CYP3A1/2 protein levels using immunoblotting. Zolmitriptan preferentially induced CYP3A2 in male but not female rats. No obvious effects on CYP3A1 were observed at any dose in either sex. Thus, we concluded that the observed sex-dependent induction of CYP3A by zolmitriptan was largely due to induction of CYP3A2 in male rats.", 
    "30": "Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders, yet the pharmacological treatments currently available have limited efficacy, being effective in only approximately 50% of patients with this disorder. The most commonly used, and generally most effective, medications for essential tremor are propranolol and primidone, administered either as monotherapy or in combination. If these medications do not provide satisfactory control of tremor, other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as metoprolol or atenolol, and other antiepileptic drugs, such as topiramate or gabapentin, are often tried. In addition, benzodiazepines can be effective in some patients, particularly those with associated anxiety. There is a need for additional medications that result in greater tremor control in a larger number of patients with essential tremor. Several new drugs, including 1-octanol, sodium oxybate, dimethoxymethyl-diphenyl-barbituric acid (T-2000) and carisbamate, are currently under investigation for the treatment of essential tremor.", 
    "31": "The rodent elevated plus-maze is based on an approach/avoidance conflict between secure closed arms and aversive open arms that can be measured to assess anxiety. Despite this apparent simplicity, several discrepancies emerge from the interpretation of an animal's behavior in the maze, especially when considering the one-trial tolerance effect.", 
    "32": "In order to bring new elements of interpretation, we compared the behavior of rats exposed to the standard version of the test (forced exposure) to the behavior of rats that were allowed to freely explore the apparatus. We also compared the effects of testing/retesting and chlordiazepoxide in these two situations.", 
    "33": "Our results confirm that open-arm avoidance is a natural tendency and therefore that it is not learned during initial exposure to the maze. In addition, comparison of the two situations suggests that some of the open-arm entries during a forced confrontation with the maze are better interpreted as attempts to avoid the whole situation, rather than as indications of a low level of anxiety. Finally, the one-trial tolerance effect was partially reduced in the free-exposure situation.",

He received multiple psychotropic drugs, including neuroleptics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines with small therapeutic response.Severe and progressive clinical impairment appeared including cognitive deterioration, chorea, tics, lingual dystonic protrusion, Parkinsonism, automutilations, and other behavioral disorders consistent with neuroacanthosytosis. Pharmacological trials were not efficacious, and the patient had medication side effects, so pharmacotherapy was reduced to minimal doses and we began electroconvulsive therapy.When the sessions were finished, the patient's speech was more coherent, although the neuroacanthosytosis was unstoppable in its progression. Thereafter, the patient received continuation electroconvulsive therapy fortnightly for 4 months until he died due the neurodegenerative disorder.", 
    "36": "The evolution of prescribing by pharmacists in Alberta is described.", 
    "37": "The prescribing model for pharmacists registered with the Alberta College of Pharmacists is defined by three categories of prescribing a Schedule 1 drug, a drug available only by prescription in Alberta. Pharmacists are not authorized to prescribe narcotics and controlled drugs (i.e., opium and its derivatives, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines) that are federally regulated. The first two categories of prescribing, adapting a prescription and prescribing in an emergency, legitimize existing practices that were not previously recognized in legislation. When adapting a prescription, the pharmacist modifies an existing prescription either to meet the unique needs of the patient or to extend therapy on an incidental basis when the patient is unable to contact the original prescriber. Emergency prescribing enables pharmacists to prescribe in unique situations when patients are unable to access other health services. Additional prescribing, the third category, provides pharmacists who successfully complete an application process the ability to independently prescribe--a privilege that is not authorized in any other jurisdiction in North America. By April 1, 2007, over 2800 pharmacists who were registered on the clinical registry had completed the orientation program necessary for prescribing to adapt a prescription or for an emergency encounter, and by September 1, 2007, over 3300 had completed the program. Fifteen pharmacists were granted additional prescribing privileges after completing a pilot program.",

For all the tested AChEI molecules, linear retention plots were observed at all temperatures. An analysis of the thermodynamics (i.e. enthalpy (DeltaH degrees ), entropy ((S degrees *)) of the interaction of the AChEI molecules with the immobilized human serum albumin was also carried out. The (H degrees and (S degrees * values for donepezil, galanthamine and neostigmine, were negative due to van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding which govern this association with albumin. Whereas the positive values of (H degrees and (S degrees * of huperzine binding on HSA indicated a predominance of hydrophobic interactions. The association of AChEIs with HSA was increased linearly with pH. A comparative thermodynamic study with benzodiazepine molecules was also done to determine the potential binding site of these drugs on HSA.", 
    "40": "Haloperidol (HAL), olanzapine (OLZ), and sulpiride (SULP) are antipsychotic drugs widely used in the pharmacotherapy of psychopathological symptoms observed in schizophrenia or mood-related psychotic symptoms in affective disorders. Here, we tested the in vitro effects of different concentrations of a typical (HAL) and two atypical (OLZ and SULP) antipsychotic drugs on ectonucleotidase activities from zebrafish brain membranes. HAL inhibited ATP (28.9%) and ADP (26.5%) hydrolysis only at 250 microM. OLZ decreased ATPase activity at all concentrations tested (23.8-60.7%). SULP did not promote significant changes on ATP hydrolysis but inhibited ADP hydrolysis at 250 microM (25.6%). All drugs tested, HAL, OLZ, and SULP, did not promote any significant changes on 5'-nucleotidase activity in the brain membranes of zebrafish. These findings demonstrated that antipsychotic drugs could inhibit NTPDase activities whereas did not change 5'-nucleotidase. Such modulation can alter the adenosine levels, since the ectonucleotidase pathway is an important source of extracellular adenosine. Thus, it is possible to suggest that changes promoted by antipsychotic drugs in the bilayer membrane could alter the NTPDase activities, modulating extracellular ATP and adenosine levels.", 
    "41": "The present study examined the effects of the intravenous administration of the anxiolytic drug brotizolam on the behavioral and physiological responsiveness of calves to novelty in a dose response fashion. Holstein Friesian heifer calves (39-41 weeks of age; body weight 200-300 kg) received an intravenous injection of either a vehicle control (12 calves) or one of four doses of brotizolam (8 calves per dose): 0.0125, 0.05, 0.2 and 0.8 mg/100 kg body weight. They were then individually subjected to a 'combined' test involving exposure to a novel environment (open field, OF) for 5 min followed by the sudden introduction of a novel object (NO) that remained in place for a further 10 min. Behavioral, heart rate and plasma cortisol responses were recorded in all animals. Compared to vehicle treatment, the highest dose of brotizolam dose-dependently and significantly increased the time spent in locomotion and the distance travelled near the NO, as well as the time spent in contact with the NO. In addition, post-test plasma cortisol concentrations changed in a dose-dependent manner over time: they decreased between 0 and 10 min after the test in calves that had received the two highest doses of brotizolam, whereas they increased in vehicle-treated and low-dosage calves. There were no effects of brotizolam on vocalization or locomotion during the OF phase of the test or on vocalization following introduction of the NO. These findings strongly support the notion that interaction with a novel object in a novel arena represents a behavioral index of fear and fearfulness in calves, and that vocalization and locomotion in an OF reflect other independent characteristics.", 
    "42": "We describe the clinical features, investigations and outcome of 4 adolescents aged 13, 16, 17 and 19 years, with fixed dystonia. The diagnosis was made within 6 months of the onset of symptoms. One patient had an identifiable traumatic precipitant. All the affected extremities had pain, sudomotor and vascular changes which were consistent with complex regional pain syndrome. The extremities affected by dystonia were the foot and the hand. The dystonia spread to affect other extremities in one patient. One patient had hemifacial spasm. Examination of the central and peripheral nervous system and allied investigations failed to reveal an organic cause. Common genetic causes for dystonia were excluded. The response to physical treatments for the affected extremities, such as Botulinum Toxin and surgery was poor. In all our cases there were significant psychological and psychiatric factors. Three patients fully met the criteria for psychogenic dystonia and responded well to psychological intervention. Fixed dystonia in adolescents is an uncommon disorder of unknown aetiology, usually presenting in girls, which can be very disabling and difficult to treat. The affected parts of the body are usually painful and show vascular changes. The condition is allied to CRPS. Treatment with multidisciplinary approach including psychological measures and physiotherapy is more likely to be successful and may prevent unnecessary physical measures.",

There was a statistically significant increase in the mean values of insulin levels, insulin resistance index, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. No pathological values in fasting glucose plasma levels were found at baseline and there were no changes after 1 year. Weight gain was positively correlated with changes in insulin levels, insulin resistance index and triglyceride levels. We did not detect statistically significant differences between treatments in any of the parameters evaluated.",

This study addresses additional outcomes measures evaluating symptoms, neurocognition, quality of life, neurological side effects, weight, and health costs. First, considering patients randomized to olanzapine or risperidone, outcomes among patients who had been on the drug to which they were randomized prior to CATIE (N=129 \"stayers\") were compared to outcomes of those who switched to either of these two drugs (N=269 \"switchers\"). A second set of analyses considered patients on baseline monotherapy with olanzapine (N=297); risperidone (N=252) or quetiapine (n=87) and compared those randomly assigned to stay on each of these medications with those assigned to switch to any of the other five phase 1 medications in CATIE. In mixed models of each outcome the independent variable of primary interest represented stay vs. switch, with multivariate adjustment for potential confounding factors.",

    "54": "In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that abused solvents affect different neurotransmitter systems, including the GABAergic, glutamatergic, and opioidergic. The first purpose of this study was to determine in mice whether an acute exposure to 4,000 ppm toluene or 12,000 ppm 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE) modifies receptor binding levels to: (a) DAMGO, a mu-opioid receptor selective agonist; (b) MK-801, a noncompetitive selective NMDA-receptor antagonist; and (c) flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine binding site selective agonist. In addition, in separate groups of animals, nociceptive effects of toluene alone or co-administered with morphine were evaluated in the hot-plate test. Mice were exposed to toluene or TCE in static exposure chambers for 30 min, and their brains were removed 24 h later for autoradiography. Acute toluene inhalation produced a significant decrease in mu-opioid receptor binding levels in cingulate and piriform cortices, caudate putamen, thalamus, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray, whereas TCE significantly decreased mu-opioid receptor levels, but only in thalamus and periaqueductal gray. Both toluene and TCE decreased benzodiazepine receptor binding levels in discrete brain areas, but had no effect on NMDA receptor levels. In the hot-plate test, a single toluene exposure counteracted morphine antinociceptive response when the solvent exposure time was immediately followed by morphine treatment, but not when morphine was administered 24, 48, 72, and 96 h later. However, co-administration of morphine and toluene 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after the single solvent exposure resulted in morphine-induced analgesia blockade. Present results suggest that mu-opioid receptors are an important molecular target for organic solvents, and that the inhalation of these compounds may affect the analgesic properties of opioids.",

The aims of the study were to find the prevalence in use of alcohol, drugs, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, opiates and stimulants, and to find the prevalence of substance use disorders at admission to an acute psychiatric department receiving all admissions from a catchment area. Patients were interviewed about use of medications and intoxicating substances during the last week before admission in 227 consecutive admissions. Urine samples were analysed with the liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. Use of substances was determined from reported use and findings in urine samples. Diagnoses were set at discharge according to ICD-10 research criteria. In 81.9% of the admissions, the patient had used alcohol, drugs, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, opiates or stimulants prior to admission. More men used alcohol, cannabis and stimulants, whereas more women used benzodiazepines. In 31.7% of the admissions, 49.5% of men and 16.4% of women, the patients had a substance use disorder (ICD-10, F10-19). Patients with substance use disorders had a shorter stay in hospital than other patients, and patients with no psychiatric disorder other than substance use disorders had a median length of stay of 2 days. Most patients had used psychoactive substances before admission to the acute psychiatric department, and half of the men had a substance use disorder.", 
    "56": "In drug-drug interaction (DDI) research, a two-drug interaction is usually predicted by individual drug pharmacokinetics (PK). Although subject-specific drug concentration data from clinical PK studies on inhibitor or inducer and substrate PK are not usually published, sample mean plasma drug concentrations and their standard deviations have been routinely reported. Hence there is a great need for meta-analysis and DDI prediction using such summarized PK data. In this study, an innovative DDI prediction method based on a three-level hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis model is developed. The three levels model sample means and variances, between-study variances, and prior distributions. Through a ketoconazle-midazolam example and simulations, we demonstrate that our meta-analysis model can not only estimate PK parameters with small bias but also recover their between-study and between-subject variances well. More importantly, the posterior distributions of PK parameters and their variance components allow us to predict DDI at both population-average and study-specific levels. We are also able to predict the DDI between-subject/study variance. These statistical predictions have never been investigated in DDI research. Our simulation studies show that our meta-analysis approach has small bias in PK parameter estimates and DDI predictions. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the influences of interaction PK parameters, such as the inhibition constant Ki, on the DDI prediction.",

Higher % drug targeting efficiency (%DTE) and %DTP for mucoadhesive nanoemulsions indicated effective brain targeting of olanzapine among the prepared nanoemulsions. Gamma scintigraphy imaging of the rat brain conclusively demonstrated rapid and larger extent of transport of olanzapine by OMNE (intranasal), when compared with OS (intranasal), ONE (intranasal), and ONE (intravenous), into the rat brain.",

Sedation requirements of ophthalmic patients have changed with the popularization of newer surgical and anesthetic techniques. Many sedative agents are available to anesthesiologists including benzodiazepines, intravenous anesthetic induction agents, narcotic analgesics and a-adrenoreceptor agonists. However, there is no single ideal sedative agent, regime or protocol that can completely cater to the wide spectrum of ophthalmic procedures performed in a heterogeneous patient population. Moreover, the clinical practice of sedation during ophthalmic surgery under local anesthesia is varied and not without risk of complications and adverse events. Hence, balanced sedative techniques should only be used after careful consideration of patient profile, the type of eye surgery, and patient and surgeon preferences. Good knowledge of the pharmacology of sedative agents is fundamental to their useful clinical application.",

At Week 6, mean change in PANSS Total score (olanzapine, -29.5; aripiprazole, -24.6 [random regression model]) showed a treatment difference of 4.9 points. As the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (6 points) was within the 95% confidence interval (2.2-7.6) for treatment difference, olanzapine proved to be superior to aripiprazole on this measure. More patients experienced significant weight gain at Week 26 with olanzapine (40%) than with aripiprazole (21%; p < .05 [weighted generalized estimating equation analysis]), with significant differences observed from Week 3.

Both [(125)I]desfluoro-IDAA1106 and [(125)I]desmethoxy-IDAA1106 were effectively binding to various brain structures. The binding could be blocked by the unlabelled ligand as well as by other PBR specific ligands. With both radiolabelled compounds, the binding showed regional inhomogeneity and the specific binding values proved to be the highest in the hippocampus, temporal and parietal cortex, the basal ganglia and thalamus in the AD brains. Compared with age-matched control brains, specific binding in several brain structures (temporal and parietal lobes, thalamus and white matter) in Alzheimer brains was significantly higher, indicating that the radioligands can effectively label-activated microglia and the up-regulated PBR/TSPO system in AD. Complementary immunohistochemical studies demonstrated reactive microglia activation in the AD brain tissue and indicated that increased ligand binding coincides with increased regional microglia activation due to neuroinflammation. These investigations yield further support to the PBR/TSPO binding capacity of DAA1106 in human brain tissue, demonstrate the effective usefulness of its radio-iodinated analogues as imaging biomarkers in post mortem human studies, and indicate that its radiolabelled analogues, labelled with short half-time bioisotopes, can serve as prospective in vivo imaging biomarkers of activated microglia and the up-regulated PBR/TSPO system in the human brain.", 
    "80": "Drug biotransformation is one of the most important parameters of preclinical screening tests for the registration of new drug candidates. Conventional existing tests rely on nonhuman models which deliver an incomplete metabolic profile of drugs due to the lack of proper CYP450 expression as seen in human liver in vivo. In order to overcome this limitation, we used an organotypical model of human primary hepatocytes for the biotransformation of the drug diazepam with special reference to metabolites in both the cell matrix phase and supernatant and its interaction of three inducers (phenobarbital, dexamethasone, aroclor 1254) in different time responses (1, 2, 4, 8, 24 h). Phenobarbital showed the strongest inducing effect in generating desmethyldiazepam and induced up to a 150 fold increase in oxazepam-content which correlates with the increased availability of the precursor metabolites (temazepam and desmethyldiazepam). Aroclor 1254 and dexamethasone had the strongest inducing effect on temazepam and the second strongest on oxazepam. The strong and overlapping inductive role of phenobarbital strengthens the participation of CYP2B6 and CYP3A in diazepam N-demethylation and CYP3A in temazepam formation. Aroclor 1254 preferentially generated temazepam due to the interaction with CYP3A and potentially CYP2C19. In parallel we represented these data in the form of a mathematical model with two compartments explaining the dynamics of diazepam metabolism with the effect of these other inducers in human primary hepatocytes. The model consists of ten differential equations, with one for each concentration c(i,j) (i=diazepam, temazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, other metabolites) and one for each compartment (j= cell matrix phase, supernatant), respectively. The parameters p(k) (k=1, 2, 3, 4, 13) are rate constants describing the biotransformation of diazepam and its metabolites and the other parameters (k=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15) explain the concentration changes in the two compartments.",

Cerebral herniation as an alternative cause for the pupillary changes was ruled out by using continuous intracranial pressure monitoring and computed tomography.

    "117": "We have previously demonstrated that olanzapine-induced desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated phospholipase C (PLC) activity is associated with increases in RGS7 protein levels both in vivo and in cells in culture, and the increase in RGS7 is dependent on activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in cells in culture. In the present study, we found that desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated PLC activity induced by olanzapine is dependent on activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Similar to olanzapine, clozapine-induced desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor signalling is accompanied by increases in RGS7 and activation of JAK2. Treatment with the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL 100907 also increased RGS7 protein levels and JAK2 activation. Using a JAK2 inhibitor AG490, we found that clozapine and MDL 100907-induced increases in RGS7 are dependent on activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Olanzapine, clozapine, and MDL 100907 treatment increased mRNA levels of RGS7. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we found STAT3 binding to the putative RGS7 promoter region. Taken together, olanzapine-induced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, and STAT3 binding to the RGS7 gene could underlie the increase in RGS7 mRNA which could subsequently increase protein expression. Furthermore, the increase in RGS7 protein could play a role in the desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor signalling by terminating the activated Galphaq/11 proteins more rapidly. Overall, our data suggest that the complete desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated PLC activity by olanzapine, clozapine and MDL 100907 requires activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which in turn increases RGS7 expression probably by direct transcriptional activity of STAT3.",

Mutations in gamma(2)loop D and alpha(1)loops A and B altered the affinity of all ligands tested, indicating that these loops are important for BZD pocket structural integrity. In contrast, gamma(2)loop E and alpha(1)loop C mutations differentially affected ligand affinity, suggesting that these loops are important for ligand selectivity. In agreement with our mutagenesis data, eszopiclone docking yielded a single model stabilized by several hydrogen bonds. Zolpidem docking yielded three equally populated orientations with few polar interactions, suggesting that unlike eszopiclone, zolpidem relies more on shape recognition of the binding pocket than on specific residue interactions and may explain why zolpidem is highly alpha(1)- and gamma(2)-subunit selective.",

The discovery of improved medicines for OCD has been hampered in part by the lack of predictive in vivo models. This unit provides a brief overview of two methods that might have such predictive utility. Marble burying and nestlet shredding are two behaviors that occur spontaneously with high frequency and repetitiveness in mice. These acute in vivo assays are relatively easy to conduct. Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors decrease these behaviors without producing motor side effects, as assessed by the behavior of walking on a rotating rod. In contrast, some other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepine anxiolytics) only affect marble burying and nestlet shredding at motor-impairing doses. The present methods might therefore provide one piece of in vivo information for the discovery of novel chemical treatment solutions for the symptoms of OCD.",

    "143": "Diazepam (7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) is widely used as a sedative, hypnotic, and anti-anxiety drug. At low diazepam concentrations, p-hydroxylation is the major metabolic pathway in rat liver microsomes. However, there are marked ( approximately 300-fold) inter- and intrastrain differences in the activity among Sprague-Dawley, Brown Norway, Dark Agouti, and Wistar rats. In our previous study, we determined that a deficiency of CYP2D3 protein, not CYP2D2, was responsible for the inter- and intrastrain differences in diazepam p-hydroxylation (Drug Metab Dispos 33:1657-1660, 2005). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) did not provide enough evidence to explain the inter- and intrastrain differences in the expression of CYP2D3 protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the insertion of a thymine in exon 8 of the CYP2D3 gene in the poor diazepam metabolizers. This single nucleotide mutation caused a shift in the reading frame and introduced a premature termination signal. It is noteworthy that the heme binding region, which is essential to maintain proper heme binding and active cytochrome P450 enzymes, was consequently deleted by the premature termination signal. In contrast, no mutation was detected in the CYP2D3 gene of extensive metabolizers. Thus, the truncated CYP2D3 must be a nonfunctional enzyme in poor metabolizers. In addition, we developed a convenient and specific genotyping assay using PCR-restriction, fragment-length polymorphism to distinguish homozygotes from heterozygotes. The genotyping gave results fully consistent with those of the inter- and intrastrain differences in diazepam p-hydroxylation.",

In addition to organic disease, secondary forms are caused by psychotropic medication. Several antidepressants, antipsychotics, lithium, and opioid withdrawal have been shown to induce or exacerbate RLS and PLMD, while several antiepileptics used as mood stabilizers and some benzodiazepines demonstrate therapeutic potential for treating RLS/PLMD. Systematic or controlled studies for evaluating these side effects still do not exist. Among the antidepressants at higher risk of inducing this disorder are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and some tetracyclic antidepressants. Under medication with some tricyclic substances, periodic limb movements were observed more often. For some antidepressants with differing transmitter profiles such as bupropion RLS/PLMD ameliorating effects or at least neutral effects (Trazodon, Nortriptylin) have been described in small studies. In case of continued of or newly occurring insomnia a thorough history should be taken to identify a possible RLS/PLMD as an intolerable side effect of treatment. A change in medications should be considered if clinically feasible. In case of RLS/PLMD occurring in psychotic patients switching the antipsychotic and additionally using a second line medication such as antiepileptics or a benzodiazepine should be considered.",

A retrospective chart review of 172 methadone maintenance treatment patients (mean age = 34.6 years; standard deviation = 8.5 years; 64% male) from January 1997 to December 1999 was conducted. At baseline, 29% were \"non-users\" (past year) of benzodiazepine, 36% were \"occasional users,\" and 35% were \"regular/problem users.\" Regular/problem users were more likely to have started opioid use with prescription opioids, experienced more overdoses, and reported psychiatric comorbidity. Being female, more years of opioid use, and a history of psychiatric treatment were significant predictors of baseline benzodiazepine use. Ongoing benzodiazepine users were more likely to have opioid-positive and cocaine-positive urine screens during methadone maintenance treatment. Only ongoing cocaine use was negatively related to retention. Benzodiazepine use by methadone maintenance treatment patients is associated with a more complex clinical picture and may negatively influence treatment outcomes.",

Patients were treated with Nervoheel N or lorazepam at the recommended doses for a maximum of 4 weeks. Dose variations were allowed if in the patient's best interest. Treatment effects were evaluated by the practitioner in a dialogue with the patient at the start of treatment, after 2 weeks and after maximally 4 weeks of treatment. Tolerability data were recorded as adverse events. At baseline, lorazepam patients were on average slightly older and there was a somewhat greater percentage of men in this group than in the Nervoheel group. Both treatment groups reported significant symptomatic improvements of similar magnitude during the course of the study. The sum of symptom scores improved by 4.4 points with Nervoheel N and by 4.2 points with lorazepam. The differences between the treatment groups were not significant. All differences between treatments were within 10% of the maximum score ranges, demonstrating non-inferiority of Nervoheel N. Both treatments were well tolerated, with few adverse events and very good self-assessed tolerability ratings by the patients. Thus, in patients who opt for a homeopathic treatment regimen for the short-term relief of mild nervous disorders, the effects of Nervoheel N are non-inferior to those of lorazepam.",

To further explore the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena, we studied the effects of prolonged diazepam treatment on the recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors, stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The results demonstrating that long-term (48 and 72 h) exposure of cells to a high concentration of diazepam (50 microM) enhanced the maximum number (B(max)) of [(3)H]flunitrazepam, [(3)H]muscimol and [(3)H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate ([(3)H]TBOB) binding sites, without changing their affinity (K(d)), suggested the up-regulation of GABA(A) receptors. As demonstrated by cell counting and WST-1 proliferation assay, the observed increase in receptor expression was not a consequence of stimulated growth of cells exposed to diazepam. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, showing elevated levels of alpha(1) subunit mRNA as well as beta(2) and gamma(2) subunit proteins, respectively, suggested that prolonged high dose diazepam treatment induced de novo receptor synthesis by acting at both transcriptional and translational levels. The finding that the number of GABA(A) receptor binding sites returned to control value 24 h following diazepam withdrawal, makes this process less likely to account for the development of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence. On the other hand, the results demonstrating that observed functional uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites persisted after the termination of diazepam treatment supported the hypothesis of its possible role in these phenomena.",

    "168": "In this report, which is an update of a guideline published in 2002 (Bandelow et al. 2002, World J Biol Psychiatry 3:171), recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are presented. Since the publication of the first version of this guideline, a substantial number of new randomized controlled studies of anxiolytics have been published. In particular, more relapse prevention studies are now available that show sustained efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. The recommendations, developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders, a consensus panel of 30 international experts, are now based on 510 published randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies (RCTs) and 130 open studies and case reports. First-line treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the calcium channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective for some disorders, but many are less well tolerated than the SSRIs/SNRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of substance abuse disorders. Potential treatment options for patients unresponsive to standard treatments are described in this overview. Although these guidelines focus on medications, non-pharmacological were also considered. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other variants of behaviour therapy have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies in patients with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD to support them being recommended either alone or in combination with the above medicines.", 
    "169": "The metabolic transformation pathways of the 1,4-benzodiazepine tetrazepam (C(16)H(17)ClN(2)O, average mass: 288.772) were studied with capillary LC-QqTOF-MS and -MS/MS by analyzing human plasma and urine samples collected from healthy volunteers. Each volunteer took 50 mg of tetrazepam, given in the form of one tablet of Myolastan (Sanofi-Synthelabo, Vienna, Austria). Accurate molecular mass measurements in full-scan mode (scan range: 50-700) were used to survey the collected samples for putative metabolic transformation products. Full-scan fragment ion mass spectra were collected in subsequent LC/MS/MS experiments. Each spectrum was matched to a spectral library containing 3759 MS/MS-spectra of 402 compounds, including eighteen different benzodiazepines, to prove the structural relatedness of a tentative metabolite to tetrazepam. This \"similarity search\" approach provided a rapid and powerful tool to exclude non-drug-related species, even without any knowledge of the fragmentation chemistry. Interpretation of tandem mass spectrometric data was only required in order to elucidate the site of transformation. Using this strategy, 11 major classes of tetrazepam metabolites were identified. Possible metabolic routes from tetrazepam to diazepam (C(16)H(13)ClN(2)O, average mass: 284.740) via repeated hydroxylation and dehydration of the cylohexenyl moiety were discovered. No evidence for extensive hydroxylation of tetrazepam at position 3 of the diazepine ring was found. In contrast to what is commonly believed, this distinct transformation reaction may be of only minor importance. Furthermore, the occurrence of demethylation, hydration, and glucuronidation reactions was proven.", 
    "170": "There is growing clinical interest of thalidomide because of its immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties, despite its teratogenicity. However, little information about thalidomide has been reported regarding its precise effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes. We investigated the effects of thalidomide on cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in human liver microsomes to clarify the potential for possible drug interactions. Thalidomide inhibited S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation activities of recombinant P450 2C19 and human liver microsomes: the apparent concentration of thalidomide producing 50% inhibition was approximately 270 microM for P450 2C19. Midazolam 4-hydroxylation activities were suppressed by thalidomide, but activities of 1'-hydroxylation and total midazolam oxidation and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation were enhanced in the presence of thalidomide. Recombinant P450 3A5 was found to have altered kinetics at clinically relevant concentrations of thalidomide (10-30 microM). P450 3A4 was also affected, but only at higher thalidomide concentrations. Enhanced midazolam hydroxylation by thalidomide was also seen in liver microsomal samples harboring the CYP3A5*1 allele. Similarly enhanced rates of cyclosporine A clearance were observed in P450 3A5 and liver microsomes expressing P450 3A5 in the presence of thalidomide. A proposed effector constant for thalidomide corresponded roughly to its clinical plasma levels. Docking studies with a P450 3A5 homology model, based on the published structure of P450 3A4, revealed close interaction between thalidomide and the heme of P450 3A5. The present results suggest that total midazolam metabolism or cyclosporine A clearance may be increased by thalidomide in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpected drug interactions involving thalidomide might occur via heterotropic cooperativity of polymorphic P450 3A5.", 
    "171": "Although the molecular machinery and mechanism of cell secretion in acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas is well documented and clear, only recently has the pharmacophysiology of pancreatic exocrine secretion come to light. Therefore, we focus in this article on the current understanding of the pharmacophysiology of pancreatic exocrine secretion. The pancreatic secretory response to ingestion of a meal is mediated via a complex interplay of neural, humoral and paracrine mediators. A major role in the control of the intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion is attributed to vago-vagal enteropancreatic reflexes. In the scheme of this control mechanism, afferents originating in the duodenal mucosa, and efferents mediating central input on the pancreatic ganglia, activate intrapancreatic postganglionic neurons. Experiments utilizing specific receptor antagonists demonstrate the involvement of both muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors expressed in pancreatic acinar cells. Cholecystokinin (CCK), originally implicated in the humoral secretion of pancreatic enzymes, through a direct action on acinar CCK receptors, is also essential to the enteropancreatic reflex mechanism. CCK stimulation of the exocrine pancreatic secretion through excitation of sensory afferents of the enteropancreatic reflexes, is a paracrine mode of CCK action, and is probably the only one in humans and the predominant one in rats. In dogs, however, CCK acts on the pancreas via both the humoral and a paracrine route. More recent experiments suggest further possible sites of CCK action. Additionally, at the brain stem, vago-vagal enteropancreatic reflexes may be modulated by input from higher brain centres, particularly the hypothalamic-cholinergic system in the tonic stimulation of preganglionic neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus projecting into the pancreas.", 
    "172": "We found that, in the striatum, acute injections of the first generation antipsychotic (FGA) haloperidol or the second generation antipsychotic (SGA) olanzapine enhanced Arc mRNA levels, however such induction persisted for at least 2 h in haloperidol-treated rats whereas it waned as early as 1 h after olanzapine injection. Conversely, repeated injections led to a persistent decrease of striatal Arc gene expression, regardless of the agent examined. In the frontal cortex, acute injection of both antipsychotics caused a reduction of Arc mRNA levels which persisted for at least 2 h. Following repeated treatment, olanzapine reduced Arc mRNA levels 2 h, but not 24 h, post-treatment whereas haloperidol was ineffective. Of note, the SGA quetiapine regulated the Arc gene expression similarly to olanzapine. Given the particular nature of Arc, our findings show its fine tuning following antipsychotic administration to be highly dependent on the length of the treatment and on the brain region investigated and suggest that antipsychotic drugs affect this marker of neuronal activity differently.",

The main model parameters were populated with data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study and a recent trial comparing aripiprazole with olanzapine. Patients enter the model with stable schizophrenia and may relapse, discontinue or continue and experience adverse events (AEs), or develop diabetes. Population mortality was adjusted for schizophrenia and diabetes. Utility decrements applied to stable schizophrenia, relapse, diabetes and treatment-related AEs were taken from a direct UK utility elicitation study. Resource use and unit costs were taken from published sources. A time horizon of 10 years was adopted. Results are based on 10,000 probabilistic iterations of the model.",

Aripiprazole followed by risperidone had the greatest probability among evaluated sequences of being cost-effective at a threshold of >\u00a310,000/QALY. All other strategies were dominated by at least one of these strategies. The impact of lower pricing for risperidone (based on generic availability) did not impact results.",

Causes of stupor may be related to brain damage, toxic or metabolic encephalopathies. Idiopathic recurring stupor is a stupurous condition of unknown aetiology, unrelated to structural, toxic or metabolic disturbance. This condition responds to flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. We describe a 60-year-old man presenting with abnormal jerky movements of the body and who was wrongly treated as status epilepticus. He responded to flumazenil which confirmed the diagnosis.", 
    "182": "One of the most frequent precipitating factors for attacks of porphyria is the administration of drugs. Use of drugs with porphyrinogenic potential often worsens the condition and often poses a therapeutic dilemma. A 23-year-old female patient presented to the casualty room with abdominal pain, chest pain and vomiting. Her past medical history was significant with episodes of generalised abdominal pain. The patient was initially treated for her abdominal pain and vomiting. She developed seizures and was treated with diazepam and phenytoin. Based on the positive investigation reports (positive urine porphyrins, elevated urine ALA and positive porphobilinogen) and symptoms, a diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) was done. Before the diagnosis of AIP was made, the patient was treated with drugs which are not considered to be safe in porphyric patients, such as phenytoin, metoclopramide, and diclofenac. The use of these drugs probably contributed to the initial worsening of the patient's clinical condition. After the diagnosis of AIP was made, the patient was treated with safer alternatives; gabapentin as the antiepileptic agent, promethazine as antiemetic, and propanalol as the antihypertensive agent. Withdrawal of the unsafe agents and symptomatic management with the safer alternatives contributed to the recovery of the patient. Along with the case report and the observations made on the various drugs used in the patient, the importance of the various information sources available on the safety potential of these agents is discussed. The observations with the drugs used in our case will be a useful addition to the existing information on the safety of these agents.", 
    "183": "Somatostatin (SST) is a cyclic polypeptide that inhibits the release of a variety of regulatory hormones (e.g. growth hormone, insulin, glucagon, thyrotropin). Moreover, SST is widely distributed within the CNS, acting both as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator of other neurotransmitter systems. However, despite its extensive expression in limbic areas, and its co-localization with GABA, a neurotransmitter previously implicated in emotion, the effects of SST on anxiety and depression have not been investigated. By performing intraventricular infusions in rats we demonstrate, for the first time, that SST has anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in the elevated plus-maze and forced swim test, respectively. In addition, by performing local field potential recordings of hippocampal theta activity evoked by reticular stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rats we also show that SST application suppresses the frequency of theta in a similar fashion to diazepam. This neurophysiological signature, common to all classes of anxiolytic drugs (i.e. benzodiazepines, selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, 5-HT1A agonists) provides strong converging evidence for the anxiolytic-like characteristics of SST. Our pharmacological antagonism experiments with bicuculline further suggest that the anxiolytic effect of SST may be attributable to the interaction of SST with GABA, whereas the antidepressant-like effect of SST may be GABA-independent. In addition to contributing to the current understanding of the role of neuropeptides in mood and emotion, these findings support a clinical role for SST (or its analogues) in the treatment of anxiety and depression.", 
    "184": "Perinatal phencyclidine (PCP) treatment has been used to model brain pathological processes that may be present in schizophrenia such as increased apoptosis during early brain development, and long-term alterations in expression of parvalbumin-containing interneurons and glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. We report that this treatment also affects receptor expression of another excitatory neurotransmitter receptor, the muscarinic receptor. Female rat pups received injections of the NMDA receptor antagonist PCP (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline on postnatal days (PN)7, 9 and 11. [3H]Pirenzepine binding to M1/4 receptors was examined at four time-points (PN12, 18, 32 and 96) following treatment cessation. Significant effects of treatment on [3H]pirenzepine binding were evident immediately after treatment cessation with a decrease in PCP-treated rats at PN12 in the prefrontal cortex (-24%, p<0.05) and hippocampus (-19%, p<0.05). After this initial decrease, binding subsequently increased to 47% above control levels in the prefrontal cortex of adolescent animals, which remained elevated in adulthood (+10%, p<0.05), while in the hippocampus there was a trend towards increased binding in adolescent animals and no change thereafter. This work adds to findings demonstrating that perinatal PCP exposure leads to long-term imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems, supporting its relevance as a developmental model of schizophrenia pathology. Alterations in muscarinic receptor expression may contribute specifically to the cognitive impairments reported to occur after perinatal NMDA receptor antagonist treatment.",

After simultaneous administration of 0.1 microg/mouse CART(61-102) and of 4 microg/kg of CCK-8, the number of Fos-positive neurons in NTS, PVN, and DMH was significantly higher than after administration of each particular peptide.

    "187": "The synergistic and long-lasting effect of the CART peptide and CCK on food intake and their additive effect on Fos immunoreactivity in their common targets suggest a co-operative action of CART peptide and CCK which could be related to synergistic effect of leptin on CCK satiety.", 
    "188": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of bromazepam on EEG and the motor learning process when healthy subjects were submitted to a typewriting task. We investigated bromazepam due to its abuse by various populations and its prevalent clinical use among older individuals which are more sensitive to the negative effects of long half-life benzodiazepines. A randomized double-blind design was used with subjects divided into three groups: placebo (n=13), bromazepam 3mg (n=13) and bromazepam 6 mg (n=13). EEG data comprising theta, alpha and beta bands was recorded before, during and after the motor task. Our results showed a lower relative power value in the theta band in the Br 6 mg group when compared with PL. We also observed a reduction in relative power in the beta band in the Br 3mg and Br 6 mg when compared with PL group. These findings suggest that Br can contribute to a reduced working memory load in areas related to attention processes. On the other hand, it produces a higher cortical activation in areas associated with sensory integration. Such areas are responsible for accomplishing the motor learning task. The results are an example of the usefulness of integrating electrophysiological data, sensorimotor activity and a pharmacological approach to aid in our understanding of cerebral changes produced by external agents.", 
    "189": "Distinct muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes widely distribute in stomach tissues and are involved in many physiological functions. Although mRNA of M(1) subtype was found in gastric mucosa, the M(1) subtype has not been detected by conventional membrane binding assays. In the present study, muscarinic receptor subtypes in the rat stomach were reevaluated by using the tissue segment binding technique recently developed to recognize the inherent/native profiles of receptors without receptor environment perturbation. [(3)H]-N-methylscopolamine (NMS) bound to muscarinic receptors in the intact segments of rat gastric mucosa and muscle layers. The muscarinic receptors in the mucosal segments were composed of M(1), M(2) and M(3) subtypes, among which the M(1) subtype selectively showed high affinity for pirenzepine. However, in the membrane preparations, binding sites with high affinity for pirenzepine could not be detected. In the muscle layer, M(2) and M(3) subtypes, but not M(1), were identified in tissue segment and conventional membrane binding assays. Western blotting analysis recognized the M(1) subtype in the membrane preparations of mucosal but not muscle layers. Chronic immobilization stress increased the M(3) subtype in mucosal and muscle layers and decreased the M(2) subtype in the muscle layer, whereas M(1) and M(2) subtypes in mucosal layer did not change after the stress. The current study shows that M(1) subtype occurs as a pirenzepine-high affinity entity in intact segments of rat gastric mucosa, but that it loses the affinity for pirenzepine upon homogenization. Careful identification of native in vivo muscarinic receptors may further elucidate their functions in stomach.", 
    "190": "A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using a high-resolution octadecyl silica column compatible with aqueous compounds was developed for the simultaneous determination of benzodiazepines and their metabolites in human serum. This method enabled us to determine multiple benzodiazepines, including flurazepam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam, clonazepam, flunitrazepam, estazolam, clobazam, lorazepam, alprazolam, triazolam, brotizolam, fludiazepam, diazepam, quazepam, prazepam and their metabolites such as 7-aminonitrazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-acetamidonitrazepam, N-desmethylclobazam and N-desmethyldiazepam. The analytes spiked into human serum were subjected to solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The running time was within 25 min for the measurement of 22 benzodiazepines and their metabolites. The recovery rates exceeded 58.1% for those compounds except for quazepam, which showed a recovery of 45.8%. The limit of detection ranged from 0.3 to 11.4 ng/mL. Linearity was satisfactory for all compounds. These data suggest that the present method can be applicable to routine assay for benzodiazepines in the clinical setting."
