    "2": "Patients were randomly assigned to patient group A or patient group B in a double-blind way. Patient group A first received 3 weeks of Deanxit, followed by 1 week of washout and 3 weeks of placebo. Treatment was given in opposite order to subjects from Patient group B.All patients received a daily treatment consisting of clonazepam 1 mg once daily, starting on Day 1.",

    "5": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug interactions caused by Kampo medicine have not been investigated sufficiently. The current study was conducted to reveal the effect of anchusan, a commonly used Kampo formula for gastrointestinal disease, on CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism in rats. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam (MDZ) was investigated after the single or one-week administration of anchusan (500 mg/kg) to evaluate its inhibitory and inducible effect on CYP3A, respectively. MDZ was administrated 16 h after the last anchsan treatment in the multiple dose study, while their intervals were 2 or 16 h in the single dose study. Unexpectedly, the multiple-pretreatment of anchusan increased the AUC of MDZ by 2.4-fold rather than decreasing it, and the CYP3A contents and activities were unchanged in hepatic and intestinal microsomes of these rats. In contrast, no significant inhibitory effects on MDZ metabolism were observed by the single anchusan pretreatment. In vitro study showed that the preincubation of anchusan and some of its component extracts with rat liver microsomes reduced CYP3A activity in a time- and NADPH-dependent manner. These results suggested that anchusan increased the serum MDZ concentration in rats, at least in part, by the time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A.", 
    "6": "The aim of this study was to explore how pharmaceutical micro-sized filler particles affect the amorphous stability of sucrose in sucrose/filler particle composites produced by freeze-drying. Focus was put on the filler particles' properties crystallinity, hygroscopicity, hydrophobicity, and surface area, and their influence on physical stability of the amorphous phase. The micro-sized filler particles were examined with Blaine permeametry, gas adsorption, pycnometry, gravimetric vapour sorption, X-ray diffraction, and light microscopy before composites of sucrose and micro-sized filler particles were prepared by freeze-drying. The stability of the composites was examined with X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and microcalorimetry. All composites were amorphous and showed higher stability compared to pure amorphous sucrose, which was evident from a delay in heat and moisture-induced crystallization. However, calcium carbonate and oxazepam micro-sized filler particles lost their ability to stabilize the amorphous sucrose when exposed to humidity. The dry glass transition temperature (T(g)) was higher for the composites, indicating the stabilization was mediated by a reduced molecular mobility of the amorphous phase.",

While studies in experimental animals have noted weight gain in olanzapine-treated female rats, these findings have yet to be replicated in males. This study investigated the effect of chronic subcutaneous infusion of olanzapine in male rats via a recently developed electrical microinfusion pump.",

Six-week infusion of olanzapine at 1.5 but not 1mg/animal/day induced significant adiposity in subcutaneous, epididymal, and retroperitoneal fat. Body weight and food intake values did not differ between olanzapine- and vehicle-treated rats throughout the experiment.", 
    "10": "The present study demonstrated that chronic infusion of olanzapine induced adiposity in male rats without inducing weight gain or hyperphagia, even with sufficient plasma concentration.

    "12": "This is a 3 year chart-review study designed to compare drug-dependent inpatients who did not report craving everyday (non-cravers) and their counterparts who did (cravers). All participants were recruited consecutively and completed a 14 day detoxification treatment. Craving was defined as a desire to use the main detoxification substance. This substance was chosen by patients, who completed a craving visual analogue scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory daily. The Temperament and Character Inventory and the Addiction Severity Index were also used.", 
    "13": "Of the 195 patients who completed the detoxification treatment, 45 (23.1%) were non-cravers and 32 (16.4%) were cravers. The main detoxification substances were alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, heroin and methadone. Non-cravers named methadone as the main detoxification substance more frequently than cravers, and benzoylecgonine was less frequently present in their urine at treatment entry. A decreased score on the Temperament and Character Inventory dimension of harm avoidance (i.e. trait anxiety) was the only independent predictor of absence of craving (odds ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.31). During admission, non-cravers had lower Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores than cravers. These differences were not accounted for by pharmacological treatment.", 
    "14": "Drug -dependent inpatients who report absence of craving are characterised by relatively low levels of depression and anxiety throughout detoxification treatment, and relatively low levels of trait anxiety.", 
    "15": "Several drugs used in psychiatry may induce constipation, paralytic ileus, or acute megacolon (Ogilvie's syndrome). We report here 2 cases of patients presenting with fatal abdominal compartment syndrome related to the absorption of antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Two patients (a 27-year-old man and a 57-year-old woman) with a previous psychiatric history and treatment with psychiatric drugs were admitted to the emergency department for coma. Both presented hypothermia; a hard, distended abdomen; and ischemia of the lower limbs. In both cases, the abdominal scan showed massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction; there was even aortic compression and ischemia of the abdominal viscera. Emergency laparotomy with bowel decompression was performed in both cases, but multiple organ failure led to death in both patients. Psychiatric drugs may induce acute severe megacolon with life-threatening abdominal compartment syndrome.", 
    "16": "Excluding laboratory mistakes, a false positive hair result can be observed in case of contamination from environmental pollution (external contamination) or after drug incorporation into the hair from the individual body fluids, such as sweat or putrefactive fluid (post mortem artifact). From our 20 years experience of hair testing, it appears that artifact(s) cannot be excluded in some post mortem cases, despite a decontamination procedure. As a consequence, interpretation of the results is a challenge that deserves particular attention. Our strategy will be reviewed in this paper, based on six cases. In all cases, a decontamination procedure with two washes of 5 ml of dichloromethane for 5 min was performed and the last dichloromethane wash was negative for each target drug. From the histories, there was no suspicion of chronic drug use. In all six cases, the concentrations detected were similar along the hair shaft, irrespective of the tested segment. We have considered this as indicative of external contamination and suggested to the forces or the judges that it is not possible to indicate exposure before death. In contrast to smoke, it seems that contamination due to aqueous matrices (sweat, putrefactive fluid, blood) is much more difficult to remove. To explain potential incorporation of 7-aminoflunitrazepam via putrefactive material, the author incubated negative hair strands in blood spiked at 100 ng/ml and stored at +4\u00b0C, room temperature and +40 \u00b0C for 7, 14 and 28 days. After routine decontamination, 7-aminoflunitrazepam tested positive in hair, irrespective of the incubation temperature, as early as after 7 days (233-401 pg/mg). In all periods, maximum concentrations were observed after incubation at room temperature. The highest concentration (742 pg/mg) was observed after 28 days incubation at room temperature. It is concluded that a standard decontamination procedure is not able to completely remove external contamination in case of post mortem specimens. Homogenous segmental analyses can be probably indicative of external contamination and therefore a single hair result should not be used to discriminate long-term exposure to a drug. Nor should the presence of a metabolite be considered as a discrimination tool, as it can also be present in putrefactive material.", 
    "17": "The fear-potentiated startle (FPS) and the light-enhanced startle (LES) paradigms are rodent tests of fear and anxiety, which combine face validity with predictive validity for clinically effective anxiolytic drugs. However, systematic strain comparisons aimed at identifying a rat strain that shows robust and reliable fear and anxiety responses in both models are missing. Here, we investigated four commonly used laboratory rat strains: Wistar, Sprague Dawley, Long-Evans and F344. Following strong cued fear conditioning training [60 conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus (CS-US) pairings], all strains except Wistar exhibited significant FPS responses. F344 rats showed the strongest FPS response. Following milder cued fear conditioning protocols, designed to reduce the underlying component of contextual fear conditioning (by context pre-exposure or less CS-US pairings), also Wistar rats were able to show significant FPS, albeit still to a lesser extent than F344 rats tested under identical conditions. When tested in the LES protocol (light intensity \u223c 1500 lx), all strains except Long-Evans displayed significant light-enhanced startle responses. F344 and Wistar showed the strongest LES responses, which were of similar magnitude. The most sensitive strain in both paradigms, F344, was chosen for further pharmacological validation. The clinically active anxiolytic alprazolam (0.3, 1, 3mg/kg p.o.) dose-dependently reduced both fear-like responses in the FPS paradigm and anxiety-like responses in the LES paradigm at non-myorelaxant dosages. We propose that the F344 rat strain is particularly suited for the predictability assessment of novel anxiolytic drugs in both startle paradigms.", 
    "18": "The administration of anesthesia has shifted away from the traditional hospital setting to an enormous increase in the use of outpatient facilities. The development of short-acting anesthetics, advances in surgical techniques, and paradigm shifts accepting targeted hospital admission and preoperative testing have allowed the acceptance of outpatient anesthesia for a wide variety of surgical procedures, including orthognathic procedures. Furthermore, the cost savings associated with office-based surgery and the declining insurance coverage for procedures such as orthognathic surgery have helped to increase the demand for surgery in this setting. The administration of anesthesia for orthognathic surgery in an outpatient setting requires preoperative preparation, preoperative patient assessment and selection, use of short-acting anesthetic agents and techniques, presence of emergency drugs and equipment, appropriate recovery protocols and staff, and the presence of adequate caregivers upon home discharge. Anesthetic techniques and agents allowing multiple orthognathic procedures to be performed in the outpatient setting are described.", 
    "19": "Benzodiazepines are widely used clinically to treat anxiety and insomnia. They also induce muscle relaxation, control epileptic seizures, and can produce amnesia. Moreover, benzodiazepines are often abused after chronic clinical treatment and also for recreational purposes. Within weeks, tolerance to the pharmacological effects can develop as a sign of dependence. In vulnerable individuals with compulsive drug use, addiction will be diagnosed. Here we review recent observations from animal models regarding the cellular and molecular basis that might underlie the addictive properties of benzodiazepines. These data reveal how benzodiazepines, acting through specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes, activate midbrain dopamine neurons, and how this could hijack the mesolimbic reward system. Such findings have important implications for the future design of benzodiazepines with reduced or even absent addiction liability.",

    "22": "None of the babies who died in the delivery room received comfort medications. The use of opiods (77%) or benzodiazepines (41%) around death was similar in all NICUs. Increasing this medication around extubation occurred most often in Montreal, rarely in Milwaukee and Groningen, and never in Chicago. Comfort medications use had no significant impact on the time between extubation and death. NMBs were never used around death in Chicago, once in Montreal, and more frequently in Milwaukee and Groningen. Initiation of NMB after extubation occurred only in Groningen.", 
    "23": "Comfort medications were administered to almost all dying infants in each NICU. Some, but not all, centers were comfortable increasing these medications around or after extubation. In three centers, NMBs were at times present at the time of death. However, only in Holland were NMBs initiated after extubation.", 
    "24": "The concentration of free-morphine was determined in peripheral (femoral) blood from heroin-related deaths and compared with the concentration in venous blood from impaired drivers. The presence of 6-MAM in blood or urine served as a biomarker for recent use of heroin. Males dominated over females (p<0.001) in both the autopsy cases (88%) and the drivers (91%), although their mean age was about the same 33-35 y (p>0.05). Concentrations of free-morphine in blood were not associated with age of heroin users in Sweden (p>0.05). The median concentration of free-morphine was higher in autopsy cases (0.24 mg/L, N=766) compared with apprehended drivers with 6-MAM in blood (0.15 mg/L, N=124, p<0.05), and appreciably higher than in drivers with 6-MAM in urine but not in blood (0.03 mg/L, N=1823, p<0.001). The free-morphine concentration was above 0.20mg/L in 65% of autopsy cases, 36% of drivers with 6-MAM in blood but only 1.4% of drivers with 6-MAM in urine. Poly-drug deaths had about the same concentrations of free-morphine in blood (0.24 mg/L, N=703) as heroin-only deaths (0.25 mg/L, N=63). The concentration of morphine in drug overdose deaths (median 0.25 mg/L, N=669) was about the same as in traumatic deaths among heroin users (0.23 mg/L, N=97). However, the concentration of morphine was lower when the deceased had consumed alcohol (0.18 mg/L, N=104) compared with taking a benzodiazepine (0.32 mg/L, N=94). The concentration distributions of free-morphine in blood in heroin-related deaths overlapped with the concentrations in impaired drivers, which makes the interpretation of toxicology results difficult without knowledge about tolerance to opiates in any individual case.",

Differences between groups were found in all sociodemographic variables (gender, marital status, education, current occupational status). Elderly patients treated at emergency rooms used more psychotropic drugs, particularly antidepressants and benzodiazepines, than non-elderly. About 25% of the patients received benzodiazepine treatment in the emergency setting, and there was no statistical difference between age groups.", 
    "29": "There is a wide prevalence of benzodiazepine use among elderly patients in a psychiatric emergency service. Despite the recommendations for its judicious use, benzodiazepines were the most commonly used drug by psychiatrists on duty, regardless of patient's age. These results call for caution in prescribing these drugs and require alternatives to the treatment of psychiatric disorders in the elderly.",

Of these, 51 involved treatment with botulinum toxin (BTX). All studies assessed spasticity; some also assessed additional outcomes, such as pain, disability, and functional status. Thirty-eight clinical trials reported a significant reduction in spasticity with BTX, either compared with baseline or with placebo (P < 0.05). A head-to-head comparison found a significant reduction in spasticity with BTX injections compared with oral tizanidine (TZD) (P < 0.001). Two studies of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) reported significant reductions in upper limb spasticity after 12 months of treatment, and 1 study of tizanidine reported significant reductions in upper limb spasticity after 16 weeks of treatment (all, P < 0.001). General or local weakness, injection-site pain, and fatigue were the most frequently reported adverse events with BTX type A, and dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event with BTX type B. No serious or life-threatening adverse events were reported in any trial of BTX.",

    "35": "Anxiety following heart failure (HF) and/or myocardial infarction (MI) can impede recovery and constitute a major risk factor for further cardiac events. The present study was aimed to evaluate anxiety following doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, a rodent model for HF, in mice. Furthermore, the study investigated the effect of alprazolam on anxiety and cardiomyopathy in this model. The study was carried out in Swiss albino mice. DOX was used at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. Alprazolam was administered at doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg po for 7 days' pre- and 7 days' post-DOX. Anxiety was measured on day 8 and on day 14 using elevated plus maze and Vogel's conflict test. On 14th day, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimated. The mice were then killed and hearts were dissected out for estimation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies. Our results showed that DOX administration induced cardiomyopathy in mice. This was evidenced by an increased serum LDH and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and was confirmed by TEM studies. Alprazolam treatment for 14 days dose dependently reversed DOX-induced increase in LDH and MDA as well as the morphological alterations induced by DOX in TEM studies. Furthermore, alprazolam also reversed the anxiety-like effects induced by DOX in both the tests for anxiety. Thus, alprazolam appears to be a good candidate for alleviating anxiety in patients following MI or HF.",

In this study, 403 patients with some degree of loss of consciousness who referred due to poisoning or drug overdose were evaluated by brain CT. The most common cause of intoxication was suicide. Intoxication status was determined by the physician and was mainly based on a history of intoxication, positive toxicologic screen result, or physical evidence suggesting intoxication. Among 403 unconscious patients, 229 patients who were ingested or inhaled Benzodiazepine, Carbamazepine, Carbon Monoxide, Ethanol, Methanol, Opium, Tricyclic antidepressants, and Tramadol included in the study. Others had used multiple drugs and/or toxins, or their intoxication was unknown. Mean age of patients was 37.6 \u00b1 17.7 years (14-95). Among them, 181 (79%) were male. Among all patients, 92 had consumed opium (40.2%), 47 had consumed Benzodiazepines (20.5%) and other patients had been overdosed by other drugs or exposed to other poisonous agents. Totally 38 (16.5%) patients had abnormal CT findings. These included 10 cases of infarction, four cases of hemorrhage, two cases of herniation, 13 cases of edema, and 10 cases of basal ganglia changes (including 9 cases of hypodensity and one case of hypodensity with hemorrhage). A good knowledge of the CT findings in unconscious patients due to poisoning or drug overdose seems to be necessary for radiologists and clinicians. This study is unique in that it reported most of the radiological findings in these patients.",

Preclinical and some clinical research suggests that progesterone and its metabolites have activity at the GABA(A) receptor and may enhance the effect of GABAergic compounds (e.g., benzodiazepines). Because women are exposed to varying levels of progesterone from puberty until menopause, and appear more sensitive to the negative consequences of benzodiazepine use, it is important to understand the impact of progesterone on GABAergic drug effects.",

On days 1 and 28, a cocktail containing midazolam 2\u00a0mg, omeprazole 20\u00a0mg, and dextromethorphan 30\u00a0mg was administered. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on day 1 without sorafenib and day 28 after steady-state sorafenib exposure; sorafenib pharmacokinetics were evaluated on day 28.

Day 28:day 1 ratios for AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) and C(max) for midazolam were 0.85 and 0.98, respectively. Day 28:day 1 ratio for 5-OH-omeprazole:omeprazole plasma concentration at 3\u00a0h postdose was 1.26, slightly outside of the 0.80-1.25 range. Thus, an interaction could not be excluded, but is considered unlikely to be clinically significant. Day 28:day 1 ratio for dextromethorphan:dextrorphan concentration in urine was 0.94. Sorafenib had an acceptable safety profile. The most frequently observed grade 3-4 toxicities in cycle 1 included elevated lipase (19%) and hypertension (10%).",

However, these differences are sufficiently small that a clinically significant inhibition or induction of these important drug metabolizing P450 isoenzymes is unlikely. Clinical and, where possible, drug level monitoring may still be appropriate for drugs of narrow therapeutic range co-administered with sorafenib.",

Triazolam was administered to the 80 patients orally at a dose of 0.375 mg 60 minutes prior to entering the operating room. During structured interviews on postoperative day 1, the patients were asked to state what they remembered of the preoperative period. Amnesia was classified based on the patients' last memory before the anesthetic induction as follows: loss of memory from immediately after taking triazolam, loss of memory at departure from the ward, loss of memory at the entrance to the operating room, loss of memory at the operating table and some recall of events at the operating table.", 
    "54": "Interviews revealed that 26.3% of the patients experienced loss of memory immediately after taking triazolam, this number increasing to 28.8% of the patients at departure from the ward, 35.0% at the entrance to the operating room and 67.5% on the operating table. The remaining patients (32.5%) had some memory of the operating room and table. Triazolam caused no respiratory depression at the operating table, although 2 of the patients experienced dizziness, 1 patient had nausea and 1 patient felt heavy-headed during the period between taking triazolam and the induction of anesthesia. Although 13 patients had delayed emergence from general anesthesia, these patients remaining anesthetized even 5 minutes after the concentration of sevoflurane in the expired gas decreased and remained below 0.1 percent, all these patients emerged immediately after intravenous administration of flumazenil.", 
    "55": "The use of triazolam as premedication produced a high incidence of amnesia for preoperative events without causing respiratory depression. Triazolam appears to be a useful premedicant for surgical patients who wish to have no memory at the operating room.", 
    "56": "Anxiety is a heterogeneous behavioral domain playing a role in a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. While anxiety is the cardinal symptom in disorders such as panic disorder, co-morbid anxious behavior can occur in a variety of diseases. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a CNS disorder characterized by increased muscle tone and prominent agoraphobia and anxiety. Most patients have high-titer antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65. The pathogenic role of these autoantibodies is unclear.", 
    "57": "We re-investigated a 53 year old woman with SPS and profound anxiety for GABA-A receptor binding in the amygdala with (11)C-flumazenil PET scan and studied the potential pathogenic role of purified IgG from her plasma filtrates containing high-titer antibodies against GAD 65. We passively transferred the IgG fraction intrathecally into rats and analyzed the effects using behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological methods. In cell culture, we measured the effect of patient IgG on GABA release from hippocampal neurons. Repetitive intrathecal application of purified patient IgG in rats resulted in an anxious phenotype resembling the core symptoms of the patient. Patient IgG selectively bound to rat amygdala, hippocampus, and frontal cortical areas. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, patient IgG inhibited GABA release. In line with these experimental results, the GABA-A receptor binding potential was reduced in the patient's amygdala/hippocampus complex. No motor abnormalities were found in recipient rats.", 
    "58": "The observations in rats after passive transfer lead us to propose that anxiety-like behavior can be induced in rats by passive transfer of IgG from a SPS patient positive for anti-GAD 65 antibodies. Anxiety, in this case, thus may be an antibody-mediated phenomenon with consecutive disturbance of GABAergic signaling in the amygdala region.", 
    "59": "Antipsychotic medications are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Previous studies have also found an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the relatives of schizophrenia probands. The aim of this study was to explore the metabolic adverse effects of olanzapine in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed psychosis and minimal or no exposure to antipsychotics. Patients with newly diagnosed psychosis (n = 30) were enrolled in a 16-week open trial of olanzapine. Body mass index, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, IL-6, and a fasting lipid profile were measured at baseline and at 4-week intervals. There was a significant, linear increase over time in fasting glucose (P = 0.043), weight (P < 0.001), body mass index (P < 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.005), triglycerides (P = 0.003), and low-density lipoprotein (P = 0.013), but not hemoglobin A1c (P = 0.691), fasting insulin (P = 0.690), IL-6 (P = 0.877), or high-density lipoprotein (P = 0.446). An abnormal baseline IL-6 was a significant predictor of a greater increase in both total cholesterol (P < 0.01) and low-density lipoprotein (P < 0.01). Otherwise, neither parental history of type 2 diabetes mellitus nor baseline IL-6 predicted changes in metabolic measures. Changes in metabolic measures with olanzapine treatment can be detected early in the treatment of patients who are previously antipsychotic naive. The absence of a change in fasting insulin suggests a failure of pancreatic islet cells to compensate for the increase in fasting glucose.",

Efficacy assessment included number of panic attacks and clinician ratings of the global severity of panic disorders with the clinical global impression (CGI) improvement (CGI-I) and CGI severity (CGI-S) scales. Most patients were females (69.8 and 68.4% in the clonazepam and paroxetine groups, respectively) and age (mean \u00b1 SD) was 35.9 \u00b1 9.6 years for the clonazepam group and 33.7 \u00b1 8.8 years for the paroxetine group. Treatment with clonazepam versus paroxetine resulted in fewer weekly panic attacks at week 4 (0.1 vs 0.5, respectively; P < 0.01), and greater clinical improvements at week 8 (CGI-I: 1.6 vs 2.9; P = 0.04). Anxiety severity was significantly reduced with clonazepam versus paroxetine at weeks 1 and 2, with no difference in panic disorder severity. Patients treated with clonazepam had fewer adverse events than patients treated with paroxetine (73 vs 95%; P = 0.001). The most common adverse events were drowsiness/fatigue (57%), memory/concentration difficulties (24%), and sexual dysfunction (11%) in the clonazepam group and drowsiness/fatigue (81%), sexual dysfunction (70%), and nausea/vomiting (61%) in the paroxetine group. This naturalistic study confirms the efficacy and tolerability of clonazepam and paroxetine in the acute treatment of patients with panic disorder.",

    "74": "AMPA receptors mediate fast excitatory transmission in the brain. Neuronal AMPA receptors comprise GluA pore-forming principal subunits and can associate with multiple modulatory components, including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and CNIHs (cornichons). AMPA receptor potentiators and non-competitive antagonists represent potential targets for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies showed that the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-53655 displaces binding of a potentiator from brain receptors but not from recombinant GluA subunits. Here, we asked whether AMPA receptor modulatory subunits might resolve this discrepancy. We find that the cerebellar TARP, stargazin (\u03b3-2), enhances the binding affinity of the AMPA receptor potentiator [(3)H]-LY450295 and confers sensitivity to displacement by non-competitive antagonists. In cerebellar membranes from stargazer mice, [(3)H]-LY450295 binding is reduced and relatively resistant to displacement by non-competitive antagonists. Coexpression of AMPA receptors with CNIH-2, which is expressed in the hippocampus and at low levels in the cerebellar Purkinje neurons, confers partial sensitivity of [(3)H]-LY450295 potentiator binding to displacement by non-competitive antagonists. Autoradiography of [(3)H]-LY450295 binding to stargazer and \u03b3-8-deficient mouse brain sections, demonstrates that TARPs regulate the pharmacology of allosteric AMPA potentiators and antagonists in the cerebellum and hippocampus, respectively. These studies demonstrate that accessory proteins define AMPA receptor pharmacology by functionally linking allosteric AMPA receptor potentiator and antagonist sites.", 
    "75": "Panic disorder (PD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder characterized by unexpected and recurrent panic attacks. PD patients present significant psychosocial impairment and a high risk of psychiatric comorbidities and suicide. PD should be treated effectively as soon as the symptoms emerge because the longer these patients remain without treatment, the worse the prognosis will be.", 
    "76": "The authors carried out a systematic review of the literature regarding the pharmacological treatment of PD in the last 10 years. Only open studies, placebo-controlled studies or comparative clinical trials were selected.", 
    "77": "Compounds with reported effectiveness in the treatment of PD included tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and other drugs. SSRIs and SNRIs are the first-line compounds in the treatment of PD. These drugs were better tolerated than tricyclics and benzodiazepines as they had a low risk of dependence and overdosing complications. The serotonergic, noradrenergic and GABAergic pathways play a major role in the fear network and in the physiopathology of PD. A better understanding of the role of these neurotransmitter systems in PD will allow the development of more effective drugs for this psychiatric condition.", 
    "78": "The p53 protein is the cell's principal bastion of defense against tumor-associated DNA damage. Commonly referred as a \"guardian of the genome\", p53 is responsible for determining the fate of the cell when the integrity of its genome is damaged. The development of tumors requires breaching this defense line. All known tumor cells either mutate the p53 gene, or in a similar number of cases, use internal cell p53 modulators, Mdm2 and Mdmx proteins, to disable its function. The release of functional p53 from the inhibition by Mdm2 and Mdmx should in principle provide an efficient, nongenotoxic means of cancer therapy. In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules thanks to several reported crystal structures of Mdm2/x in complex with p53-mimicking peptides and nonpeptidic drug candidates. Understanding the structural attributes of ligand binding holds the key to developing novel, highly effective, and selective drug candidates. Two low-molecular-weight compounds have just recently progressed into early clinical studies.", 
    "79": "A liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method for the simultaneous identification and quantification of 28 benzodiazepines, including 6 metabolites, in 50 mg of hair has been validated. Positive ion electrospray ionization and HRMS determination in full-scan mode were realized on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer at a nominal resolving power of 60,000. In-source collisional experiments were conducted to obtain additional information for a more reliable identification of the investigated drugs. HRMS in full-scan mode allowed the exact determination of molecular masses of all analytes eluting in the HPLC run, so that both the immediate and retrospective screening of results for drugs and their metabolites were available. Sample preparation consisted of an overnight incubation in phosphate buffer pH 8.4 and a subsequent liquid/liquid extraction with methylene chloride/diethyl ether (90:10). Gradient elution was performed on a Luna C18 analytical column and four deuterated analogues were used as internal standards (IS). Validation was performed using both spiked hair samples and hair samples from subjects treated with benzodiazepines. Selectivity was evaluated by analysis of 20 certified blank hair samples. Extraction efficiency and matrix effects were evaluated by analysis of true positive samples. The lowest limits of quantification (LLOQs) ranged from 1 to 10 pg/mg. Linearity was investigated in the range from LLOQ to 1,000 pg/mg, for each compound (R(2) 0.998-0.999). Mean relative errors, calculated at three concentration levels, ranged from 1 to 20% (absolute value). Precision, at concentrations higher than the LLOQs, was always less than 15% expressed as percentage relative standard deviation. After validation, the procedure was applied to real samples collected for clinical and forensic toxicology purposes from subjects who were assumed to have taken benzodiazepines.", 
    "80": "The use of dried blood and dried plasma spots for storage and transportation of samples derived from clinical trials holds the promise to reduce cost, simplify storage and shipping as well as reducing animal usage. From the bioanalysts' point of view, these dried-paper samples add an extra layer of complexity to the analysis introducing extra matrix effects from the paper itself and sometimes from antiviral treatments applied to the card. In this article we demonstrate the use of the sub-2-\u00b5m particle LC-MS/MS for the bioanalysis of samples derived from a dried blood spot. The higher resolution provided by these small-particle separations allowed for greater resolution of the analyte from the endogenous components in blood samples and from the card-treatment chemicals. The method-development process was enhanced by the use of MS, which could simultaneously acquire full scan and multiple reaction monitoring data, allowing resolution from metabolites and endogenous matrix components. The use of this approach produced sensitivity levels in the 50-100 pg/ml range and analysis times in the 1-2 min range, which was five-times more sensitive and three-times faster than HPLC. This throughput and sensitivity makes this approach ideal for the analysis of preclinical and clinical studies derived from dried blood spots.",

The proposed analytical methodology offers rapid analysis for a large number of compounds, with low limits of quantification and utilises only one solid-phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) method, thus overcoming the drawbacks of previously published procedures. The method employed solid phase extraction with the usage of Oasis MCX sorbent and subsequent ultra performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. The usage of a 1.7 \u03bcm particle size column (1 mm\u00d7150 mm) resulted in very low flow rates (0.04 mLmin(-1)), and as a consequence gave good sensitivity, low mobile phase consumption and short retention times for all compounds (from 2.9 to 23.1 min). High SPE recoveries (>60%) were obtained for the majority of compounds. The mean correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were typically higher than 0.997 and showed good linearity in the range 0-1000 \u03bcgL(-1).

Male balb-c mice were treated subchronically with olanzapine (1.25, 2.5 and 5mg/kg, i.p.), sertindole (0.63, 1.3, 2.5mg/kg, s.c.) or clozapine (0.5 and 1mg/kg, i.p.), and cognitive deficits were induced by MK-801 (0.2mg/kg, i.p.) administration. Water maze performance was expressed as escape latency to find the hidden platform, the time spent in target quadrant, the mean distance to platform and the swim speed. In naive mice olanzapine impaired water maze performance, whereas sertindole and clozapine had no effect while the MK-801-induced cognitive impairment was reversed by the second generation antipsychotics - olanzapine, sertindole and clozapine at the doses used.

    "109": "Most experimental studies on hemorrhage and trauma are performed under anesthesia. We determined the effects of three commonly used anesthetic regimens on hemodynamics and organ damage under normal and hemorrhagic/traumatic shock (HTS) conditions in rats. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/diazepam (K/D), ketamine/xylazine (K/X), or isoflurane (ISO). Hemorrhagic/traumatic shock was induced by a midline laparotomy, bleeding to a mean arterial pressure of 30 to 35 mmHg until decompensation, followed by restrictive and adequate phases of resuscitation. The experiment was terminated 120 min after the completion of resuscitation. Under normal conditions, K/D anesthesia resulted in higher mean arterial pressure and heart rate than K/X and higher systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) than ISO. Stroke volume was significantly lower in K/D group than in K/X and ISO groups. Under normal conditions, ISO anesthesia was accompanied by the highest cardiac index. During shock and resuscitation, heart rate remained higher in the K/D than K/X. During shock, SVRI decreased in the K/D group but increased in K/X and ISO groups. After resuscitation, SVRI was lower, and cardiac index was higher in the ISO group than in the K/D group. Despite higher shed blood volume, the rats anesthetized with ISO did not decompensate within the time frame compared with other groups.

The diagnosis of Parkinson disease was made approximately four months prior. Despite initiation of carbidopa-levodopa, the patient's symptoms did not improve, and her mental and physical status declined. The patient was taking olanzapine 30 mg daily for bipolar disorder and had a 40-pack-year history of smoking, but she quit smoking approximately four months before this hospitalization. The results of a neurologic evaluation suggested that the patient did not have Parkinson disease but was possibly experiencing olanzapine toxicity secondary to smoking cessation. Carbidopa-levodopa was discontinued. Psychiatry was consulted, and a monthlong cross-taper to discontinue olanzapine and initiate aripiprazole with a target dosage of 20 mg daily was recommended. During the course of therapy, the patient's level of alertness and bradykinesia improved. Overall, it was noted that her extrapyramidal symptoms were gradually improving; two days before hospital discharge, she was noted to have no definite remaining evidence of parkinsonism. In this case, use of the Naranjo et al. adverse-drug-reaction probability scale and the drug interaction probability scale indicated that the adverse effects were probably related to the interaction between smoking and olanzapine.",

    "145": "We hypothesized that protein source in the nutritionally adequate AIN-93G diets fed during gestation, lactation, and weaning influences food intake (FI) regulation in male offspring of Wistar rats. Pregnant rats were fed the recommended casein-based (C) or soy protein-based (S) diet during gestation (experiment 1) or during gestation and lactation (experiment 2). Pups (n = 12 per group) weaned to C or S diets were followed for 9 wk (experiment 1) or 14 wk (experiment 2). At termination, body weight was 5.4% and 9.4% higher, respectively, in offspring of dams fed the S diet. Altered FI regulation was shown by failure of devazepide (a CCK-A receptor blocker) to block FI reduction after protein preloads in offspring of S diet-fed dams, whereas it had a strong effect on offspring of C diet-fed dams (P < 0.005). Similarly, naloxone (an opioid receptor blocker) blocked FI reduction more after casein than after soy protein preloads (P < 0.01). In experiment 2, offspring of dams fed the S diet had higher hypothalamic gene expression of agouti related protein at weaning (P < 0.05), and higher FI was found throughout postweaning (P < 0.0001). FI reduction after protein preloads at week 7 and after glucose preloads at week 13 was greater in offspring of C diet-fed dams (P < 0.05). Plasma insulin at weaning and insulin, ghrelin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 at week 15 were higher in offspring of S diet-fed dams (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, nutritionally complete C and S diets consumed during gestation and lactation differ in their effects on body weight and FI regulation in the offspring. Extending the diet from gestation alone to throughout gestation and lactation exaggerated the adverse effects of the S diet. However, the diet consumed postweaning had little effect on the outcome.",

In two large (both n = 480), well designed, 3-week trials in adult patients with bipolar I disorder, asenapine monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo at improving mania symptoms, as assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale total score (YMRS; primary endpoint), with significant differences between the asenapine and placebo groups occurring after 2 days of treatment. In both trials, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) scale mania severity scores exceeded those of placebo. In one trial, response and remission rates exceeded those of placebo.

In a 12-week trial of asenapine as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, asenapine was more effective than placebo in improving manic symptoms, based on the difference between groups in the YMRS total score at week 3 (primary endpoint). Most adverse events associated with asenapine were of mild to moderate severity, with <7% of asenapine recipients experiencing serious adverse events (vs 7% with placebo). In a pooled analysis of the monotherapy trials, the most common adverse events (occurring in \u2265 5% of patients and at twice the incidence of placebo) reported during acute phase asenapine monotherapy for bipolar mania were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, other than akathisia) and increased bodyweight, which were similar in nature to those occurring during longer-term monotherapy with asenapine. EPS did not worsen in severity during longer-term asenapine monotherapy. Asenapine had minimal effects on plasma glucose, lipid and prolactin levels over both short- and longer-term treatment periods, and had little pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Further active comparator trials and longer-term tolerability and safety data are required. In the meantime, asenapine is a further option for the management of manic and/or mixed symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder and may be of particular value for patients who are at high risk for metabolic abnormalities.",

The intensity spectrum analysis and homogeneity analysis of the voxel data show that the homogeneity of the %SUV values decreases with ageing and during the disease, whereas the centre of the intensity spectrum is shifted to higher %SUV values.

However, questions remain regarding the neuropharmacological basis of movement related oscillatory phenomena, such as movement related beta desynchronisation (MRBD), post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) and movement related gamma synchronisation (MRGS). To address this, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the movement related oscillatory changes in M1 cortex of eight healthy participants, following administration of the GABA-A modulator diazepam. Results demonstrate that, contrary to initial hypotheses, neither MRGS nor PMBR appear to be GABA-A dependent, whilst the MRBD is facilitated by increased GABAergic drive. These data demonstrate that while movement-related beta changes appear to be dependent upon spontaneous beta oscillations, they occur independently of one other. Crucially, MRBD is a GABA-A mediated process, offering a possible mechanism by which motor function may be modulated. However, in contrast, the transient increase in synchronous power observed in PMBR and MRGS appears to be generated by a non-GABA-A receptor mediated process; the elucidation of which may offer important insights into motor processes.", 
    "170": "GABA(A) receptors have been shown to modulate dopaminergic output from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in studies of both natural and drug rewards, including alcohol. Ro15-4513, the imidazobenzodiazepine derivative and allosteric modulator at the GABA(A) receptor, reliably antagonizes the behavioral effects of alcohol. Various models of alcohol consumption show a decrease in consummatory behaviors, specific to ethanol, following acute administration of the drug. In the present study, Ro15-4513 was systemically administered, or microinjected into the anterior or posterior VTA, to explore the role of GABA(A) receptors at this region in modulating the high pattern of alcohol consumption by C57BL/6J inbred mice in the Drinking in the Dark (DID) model. Animals had 2h access to ethanol for 6 days prior to drug manipulations. Immediately before the seventh day of access, mice were systemically (I.P.) or site-specifically administered Ro15-4513. Systemic Ro15-4513 (at 10mg/kg) decreased binge-like ethanol intake in the DID paradigm. Additionally, there was a stepwise decrease in consumption following Ro15-4513 microinjection into the posterior VTA, with the highest dose significantly decreasing ethanol intake. There was no effect found following microinjection into the anterior VTA, nor was there an effect of systemic or intra-posterior VTA Ro15-4513 on consumption of a 5% sucrose solution or water. The present findings support a role for Ro15-4513 sensitive VTA-GABA(A) receptors in modulating binge-like ethanol consumption. Moreover, the work here adds to the growing body of literature suggesting regional heterogeneity in the VTA.",

Acute olanzapine increased extracellular NT-LI, in both the vSTR and the mPFC. Chronic olanzapine increased and decreased basal extracellular NT-LI in the vSTR and the mPFC, respectively, and abolished the stimulatory effects of acute d-amphetamine on extracellular NT-LI in these brain regions. Chronic olanzapine as well as acute and chronic d-amphetamine affected NT-LI tissue content in a brain region-dependent manner. Chronic olanzapine prevented the effects of acute and chronic d-amphetamine on NT-LI tissue content in certain brain regions. The fact that olanzapine and d-amphetamine affected extracellular NT-LI in the vSTR and mPFC as well as NT-LI tissue content in distinct brain regions further supports the notion that NT plays a role in the therapeutic actions of antipsychotic drugs and possibly also in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",

After a single step liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether/dichloromethane (75:25, v/v), analytes were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using positive electro-spray ionization (ESI(+)) under selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM). Chromatographic separation was performed on an XTerra MS C18 column (50mm\u00d72.1mm, i.d. 3.5\u03bcm).

Males of Mecp2-deficient mice (Mecp2(-/y)) normally breathe at birth but develop first altered breathing regulations, thereafter erratic breathing with severe apnoeas, aggravating until respiratory distress and premature death. Mecp2(-/y) mice also develop early GABA deficits. To examine whether GABA deficits contributed to breathing defects of Mecp2(-/y) mice, mice were subjected to acute administration of Midazolam, a benzodiazepine of clinical use known to enhance GABA effects. For the first time, we showed that Midazolam abolished, although transiently, the breathing defects of Mecp2(-/y) mice, confirming a crucial role of GABA deficits in their breathing defects.", 
    "191": "Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulate xenobiotic sensing and metabolism through interactions with multiple exogenous and endogenous chemicals. Compounds that activate CAR are often ligands of PXR; attention is therefore given to discovery of new, receptor-specific chemical entities that may be exploited for therapeutic and basic research purposes. Recently, ligands of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), PK11195 and FGIN-1-27, were shown to modulate both CAR and PXR. PBR is a mitochondrial transport protein responsible for multiple regulatory functions, including heme biosynthesis, a major component in cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. To investigate possible new roles for PBR involvement in metabolic regulation, expression of the CAR and PXR target genes, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, was measured in human hepatocytes following treatment with a targeted PBR ligand set. Luciferase reporter assays with transiently expressed wild-type CAR (CAR1), splice variant CAR3, or PXR in HuH-7 cells were used to further study activation of these receptors. Four structurally related PBR ligands (benzothiazepines) differentially modulate CAR1, CAR3 and PXR activity. Benzothiazepine NF49 is an agonist ligand of CAR3, a partial agonist of PXR, exhibits greater inverse agonist activity on CAR1 than does PK11195, and is a new tool for studying these closely related nuclear receptors.",

Chlordiazepoxide, initially called methaminodiazepoxide, was patented in 1958 and introduced in clinical treatment in 1960 under the brand name Librium\u00ae. The benzodiazepines became the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, provided truly effective treatment for \"minor forms\" (neuroses) of mental disorders for the first time, increased the quality of scientific methodology in clinical research, and enabled the development of new etiopathogenic theories for anxiety disorders, especially after the discovery in 1977 of their high-affinity receptor complex.", 
    "193": "Human pluripotent stem cells have enormous potential value in neuropharmacology and drug discovery yet there is little data on the major classes and properties of receptors and ion channels expressed by neurons derived from these stem cells. Recent studies in this lab have therefore used conventional patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the pharmacological properties of the ligand and voltage-gated ion channels in neurons derived and maintained in vitro from the human stem cell (hSC) line, TERA2.cl.SP12. TERA2.cl.SP12 stem cells were differentiated with retinoic acid and used in electrophysiological experiments 28-50 days after beginning differentiation. HSC-derived neurons generated large whole cell currents with depolarizing voltage steps (-80 to 30 mV) comprised of an inward, rapidly inactivating component and a delayed, slowly deactivating outward component. The fast inward current was blocked by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (0.1 \u03bcM) and the outward currents were significantly reduced by tetraethylammonium ions (TEA, 5 mM) consistent with the presence of functional Na and K ion channels. Application of the inhibitory neurotransmitters, GABA (0.1-1000 \u03bcM) or glycine (0.1-1000 \u03bcM) evoked concentration dependent currents. The GABA currents were inhibited by the convulsants, picrotoxin (10 \u03bcM) and bicuculline (3 \u03bcM), potentiated by the NSAID mefenamic acid (10-100 \u03bcM), the general anaesthetic pentobarbital (100 \u03bcM), the neurosteroid allopregnanolone and the anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide (10 \u03bcM) and diazepam (10 \u03bcM) all consistent with the expression of GABA(A) receptors. Responses to glycine were reversibly blocked by strychnine (10 \u03bcM) consistent with glycine-gated chloride channels. The excitatory agonists, glutamate (1-1000 \u03bcM) and NMDA (1-1000 \u03bcM) activated concentration-dependent responses from hSC-derived neurons. Glutamate currents were inhibited by kynurenic acid (1 mM) and NMDA responses were blocked by MgCl(2) (2 mM) in a highly voltage-dependent manner. Together, these findings show that neurons derived from human stem cells develop an array of functional receptors and ion channels with a pharmacological profile in keeping with that described for native neurons. This study therefore provides support for the hypothesis that stem cells may provide a powerful source of human neurons for future neuropharmacological studies.",

Ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists have anxiolytic action. MK-801 was more effective in females, as it prevented the footshock-induced freezing per se, while in males it was effective only in combination with GyKI 52466. The locomotor side effect of MK-801 was not visible after repeated administration. The freezing behavior was positively correlated with the changes in prolactin but not with adrenocorticotropin levels.",

    "198": "Synthesis of a library of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]-benzodiazepines derived from spiro bicyclic D- or L-proline analogues containing a D- or L-fructose moiety was developed. The L-fructose moiety was obtained by using a new synthetic pathway starting from L-arabinose through a six steps synthesis in 18% overall yield. Molecular modeling calculations and DNMR studies showed that D- and L-fructose-based pyrrolobenzodiazepines exhibit a rigid (P)- and (M)-helical conformation, respectively, in which the C-11a substituent was always pseudoequatorial. Additionally, pyrrolobenzodiazepines functionalized with a chloride, bromide, nitro, or amino group in the benzene ring, with or without N-methylation and with or without protection of sugar alcohol groups, allowed a relationship between the molecular structure and biological activity to be established. The conformation of the diazepam ring was not the sole key player influencing binding affinities, and the sugar moiety can in some cases increase the binding activity, possibly by participating in the binding event. Finally, these compounds have increased the understanding of the differential recognition of (M)-/(P)-helical benzodiazepines on GABA(A) receptor.",

In this study we present a patient intoxicated with lorazepam who developed a ventricular tachycardia after receiving flumazenil as therapeutic mean, though the attack was appropriately terminated by administration of a bolus dose of Amiodarone. We believe that the ventricular tachycardia onset in above mentioned case is secondary to Flumazenil administration in susceptible patient with previous history of ischemic heart disease.

Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, post-operative pain, narcotic requirements and complications (nausea, vomiting, pruritic, headache, hypotension and bradycardia) were recorded. The severity of post-operative pain was lowest in M 1.0 group in all postoperative measurements except at 2 h after operation. With regard of complications, only there was significant difference in vomiting between three groups which had the highest frequency in M 0.5 group. No severe hypotension was seen; though, bradycardia occurred in one patient in M 0.5 group which needed treatment.

    "201": "Flavonoids are present in almost all terrestrial plants, where they provide UV-protection and colour. Flavonoids have a fused ring system consisting of an aromatic ring and a benzopyran ring with a phenyl substituent. The flavonoids can be divided into several classes depending on their structure. Flavonoids are present in food and medicinal plants and are thus consumed by humans. They are found in plants as glycosides. Before oral absorption, flavonoids undergo deglycosylation either by lactase phloridzin hydrolase or cytosolic \u03b2-glucosidase. The absorbed aglycone is then conjugated by methylation, sulphatation or glucuronidation. Both the aglycones and the conjugates can pass the blood-brain barrier. In the CNS several flavones bind to the benzodiazepine site on the GABA(A)-receptor resulting in sedation, anxiolytic or anti-convulsive effects. Flavonoids of several classes are inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A or B, thereby working as anti-depressants or to improve the conditions of Parkinson's patients. Flavanols, flavanones and anthocyanidins have protective effects preventing inflammatory processes leading to nerve injury. Flavonoids seem capable of influencing health and mood.",

It is as yet unknown whether propofol in combination with an opiate is superior to propofol alone to suppress cough during the procedure. 300 consecutive patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy at a tertiary care university hospital were randomly allocated to receive either the combination propofol and hydrocodone or propofol alone in a double-blind fashion. The primary end-point was the cough score during the procedure as estimated by the physician using a visual analogue scale. Demographics were similar in both groups. Compared with propofol alone, median (interquartile range) cough scores assessed by physicians, nurses and patients were significantly lower in the group randomised to the combination propofol and hydrocodone (2.5 (1.5-4.0) versus 2.0 (1.0-3.0), respectively, p=0.011). Additionally, patients receiving the combination required significantly lower doses of propofol than those receiving propofol alone (200 mg (140-280) versus 260 mg (180-350), p<0.0001). Complex examinations, including bronchoalveolar lavage or transbronchial biopsy, benefited more from additional opiate. The duration of the procedure, time to discharge and complication rate were similar in both groups. The combination of propofol and hydrocodone is safe and superior to propofol alone for cough suppression in flexible bronchoscopy.",

Displacement experiences, including dispossession, livelihood restriction, hopelessness and uncertain future may make communities particularly vulnerable to substance use and its impact, and changing social norms and networks (including the surrounding population) may result in changed - and potentially more harmful-patterns of use. Limited access to services, including health services, and exclusion from relevant host population programmes, may exacerbate the harmful consequences.",

This is poorly tolerated by a substantial number of patients, which leads to its potential premature abandonment and subsequent additional investigations and therapeutics, and hence to the exposure of patients to avoidable risk and the health service to increased costs. Furthermore, concerns have been raised in the recent literature regarding safe sedation techniques.", 
    "212": "The aim of this study was to compare the completion rates and safety profile of ERCP using BS vs. those of ERCP using light propofol anaesthesia (PA).", 
    "213": "We carried out a retrospective, case-matched comparison analysis of consecutive patients who underwent ERCP with BS vs. PA, in the presence of an anaesthetist, over a 2-year period. Benzodiazepine sedation consisted of midazolam, fentanyl and buscopan. Propofol anaesthesia consisted of propofol, fentanyl and buscopan administered via a mouth guard in a non-intubated patient. Patient demographics, complications and completion rates were recorded. Procedural monitoring included pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiography and end-tidal CO(2) . Statistical analyses used t-tests to compare continuous variables and chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests to compare categorical variables. A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant.",

Median ages in the BS and PA groups were 69 years (range: 20-99 years) and 65 years (range: 26-98 years), respectively (P= 0.07). Median hospital stays in the BS and PA groups were 1 day (range: day case to 61 days) and 1 day (range: day case to 38 days), respectively (P= 0.61). Incidences of mild anaesthesia-related complications in the BS and PA groups were 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively (P= 0.97). There were no severe anaesthesia-related complications. Incidences of mild procedural complications in the BS and PA groups were 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively (P= 0.68). One severe procedural complication occurred in the PA group. Incidences of incomplete ERCP procedures in the BS and PA groups were 10.9% (n= 14) and 4.0% (n= 5), respectively (odds ratio = 2.92, 95% confidence interval 1.02-8.38; chi-squared test, P= 0.04; Fisher's exact test, P= 0.03).",

Factors that may be predictive of suicidality in an exclusively bipolar population are examined. White race, family suicide history, and history of cocaine abuse were predictive of suicidal histories. Gender, nicotine use, medical comorbidity, and history of alcohol and other drug abuse were not, although a trend was noted for a history of benzodiazepine abuse. Attempts, although less common among African Americans, were equally as violent. Likewise, attempts were as violent among females as males, in distinction to general population studies.",

A meta analysis shows the effectiveness of post-acute geriatric rehabilitation in reducing functional decline after hospitalisation. Several studies evaluated pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines' efficacy. A short and simple intervention is effective in reducing benzodiazepine use. The effect of vitamine D on falls and fractures has been further evaluated in several studies. Diagnostic criteria for dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, are moving to better acknowledge their preclinical stages.", 
    "218": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder that may result in significant social and occupational debilitation unless symptoms are recognized and treated appropriately. Considerable research effort has been devoted over the last 20 years to developing effective pharmacological treatments for this illness. At this time, the bulk of the agents investigated include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and antiadrenergic agents. Herein, we review the existing evidence base for these different classes of psychotropics in PTSD. Emphasis is placed on discussion of evidence stemming from randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials wherever possible. A brief description of novel agents that have shown initial promise for PTSD treatment is also provided.", 
    "219": "A range of medications have been shown effective for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. The largest trials to date have been with various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Several of these agents have been registered for the treatment of social anxiety disorder with agencies such as the FDA or EMEA, meta-analyses confirm their efficacy and safety, and expert consensus guidelines have often recommended them as a first-line pharmacotherapy of choice. Despite such advances, there are many unanswered questions in the pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder, including the optimal pharmacotherapy of patients refractory to first-line intervention, and the optimal sequencing of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Translational research has already had an impact on concepts of treatment, and may ultimately lead to novel interventions.",

    "221": "Antidepressant drug treatment is the clinical standard of care for all types of anxiety disorders. Broad efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors suggests the importance of enhanced serotonergic function of the anxiolytic properties of current antidepressants. However, analysis of the preclinical evidence indicates that most conventional \"anxiolytic\" drug tests are not sensitive to antidepressants. Such dissociation is not surprising because of the traditional approach to validation of preclinical tests that is to a large extent based on establishing face validity as well as sensitivity to benzodiazepine anxiolytics. The present review argues for extending the cognitive model of antidepressant drug action to cover their anxiolytic properties as well. Such an approach is based on ambiguity or uncertainty in a broad sense as the hallmark of human stress that has different expressions ready for experimental modeling. These possibilities include schedule-induced behaviors that are directly based on intermittent reinforcement, conditioning to ambiguous stimuli, social stress where agonistic confrontations are possible but not predictable or controlled by the subject, and an even larger class of behaviors that are critically dependent on the inhibition of the prepotent responses in exchange for the ambiguous possibility of a later gain in reinforcement. Interestingly, in all these cases, antidepressant drug treatment is clearly effective in preclinical laboratory settings. One of the cognitive functions that appears to be affected by antidepressant drugs is inhibitory control. Inhibition of prepotent responding has beneficial effects in the \"uncertainty\" stress situations discussed above and therefore it is this cognitive function that may be critical for anxiolytic effects of antidepressants and novel anxiolytic drug development.", 
    "222": "Nonselective benzodiazepines exert their pharmacological effects via GABAA receptors containing either an alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 subunit. The use of subtype-selective tool compounds along with transgenic mice has formed the conceptual framework for defining the requirements of subtype-selective compounds with potentially novel pharmacological profiles. More specifically, compounds which allosterically modulate the alpha2 and/or alpha3 subtypes but are devoid of, or have much reduced, effects at the alpha1 subtype are hypothesized to be anxioselective (i.e., anxiolytic but devoid of sedation). Accordingly, three compounds, MRK-409, TPA023 and TPA023B, which selectively potentiated the effects of GABA at the alpha2 and alpha3 compared to alpha1 subtypes were progressed into man. All three compounds behaved as nonsedating anxiolytics in preclinical (rodent and primate) species but, surprisingly, MRK-409 produced sedation in man at relatively low levels of occupancy (< 10%). This sedation liability of MRK-409 in man was attributed to its weak partial agonist efficacy at the alpha1 subtype since both TPA023 and TPA023B lacked any alpha1 efficacy and did not produce overt sedation even at relatively high levels of occupancy (> 50%). The anxiolytic efficacy of TPA023 was evaluated in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and although these clinical trials were terminated early due to preclinical toxicity issues, the combined data from these incomplete studies demonstrated an anxiolytic-like effect of TPA023. This compound also showed a trend to increase cognitive performance in a small group of schizophrenic subjects and is currently under further evaluation of its cognition-enhancing effects in schizophrenia as part of the TURNS initiative. In contrast, the fate of the back-up clinical candidate TPA023B has not been publicly disclosed. At the very least, these data indicate that the pharmacological profile of compounds that differentially modulate specific populations of GABAA receptors is distinct from classical benzodiazepines and should encourage further preclinical and clinical investigation of such compounds, with the caveat that, as exemplified by MRK-409, the preclinical profile might not necessarily translate into man.", 
    "223": "The tripartite model of anxiety includes three response domains: cognitive (most often identified by self report), behavioral, and physiological. Each is suggested to bring a separate element of response characteristics and, in some cases, potentially independent underlying mechanisms to the construct of anxiety. In this chapter, commonly used behavioral correlates of anxiety in human research, including startle reflex, attentional bias, and avoidance tasks, as well as future tasks using virtual reality technology will be discussed. The focus will be in evaluating their translational utility supported by (1) convergent validity with other measures of anxiety traits or anxiety disorders, (2) their use in identifying neural and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, and (3) ability to predict treatment efficacy.", 
    "224": "To date, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of major depression have examined suicidal ideation as an outcome measure.

Worsening of suicidal ideation occurred in 7/60 patients who had suicidal ideation at baseline. In the large majority of cases, suicidal ideation was successfully managed with the study protocol.", 
    "227": "In the context of careful monitoring and frequent contact, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was associated with a lower risk of ESI than IPT and both SSRI and IPT appeared to be safe treatments for patients with past suicide attempts, none of whom exhibited ESI during the study.",

    "236": "Temporal lobe epilepsy is prevalent and can be difficult to treat effectively. Granule cell axon (mossy fiber) sprouting is a common neuropathological finding in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, but its role in epileptogenesis is unclear and controversial. Focally infused or systemic rapamycin inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and suppresses mossy fiber sprouting in rats. We tested whether long-term systemic treatment with rapamycin, beginning 1 d after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in mice, would suppress mossy fiber sprouting and affect the development of spontaneous seizures. Mice that had experienced status epilepticus and were treated for 2 months with rapamycin displayed significantly less mossy fiber sprouting (42% of vehicle-treated animals), and the effect was dose dependent. However, behavioral and video/EEG monitoring revealed that rapamycin- and vehicle-treated mice displayed spontaneous seizures at similar frequencies. These findings suggest mossy fiber sprouting is neither pro- nor anti-convulsant; however, there are caveats. Rapamycin treatment also reduced epilepsy-related hypertrophy of the dentate gyrus but did not significantly affect granule cell proliferation, hilar neuron loss, or generation of ectopic granule cells. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that hilar neuron loss and ectopic granule cells might contribute to temporal lobe epileptogenesis.",

We examine variation across commonly prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications in medication discontinuation and psychiatric hospital admission among children and adolescents clinically diagnosed with schizophrenia. A 45-state Medicaid claims file (2001-2005) was analyzed focusing on outpatients, aged 6-17 years, diagnosed with schizophrenia or a related disorder prior to starting a new episode of antipsychotic monotherapy with risperidone (n = 805), olanzapine (n = 382), quetiapine (n = 260), aripiprazole (n = 173), or ziprasidone (n = 125). Cox proportional hazard regressions estimated adjusted hazard ratios of 180-day antipsychotic medication discontinuation and 180-day psychiatric hospitalization for patients treated with each medication. During the first 180 days following antipsychotic initiation, most youth treated with quetiapine (70.7%), ziprasidone (73.3%), olanzapine (73.7%), risperidone (74.7%), and aripirazole (76.5%) discontinued their medication (\u03c7(2) = 1.69, df = 4, P = .79). Compared with risperidone, the adjusted hazards of antipsychotic discontinuation did not significantly differ for any of the 4-comparator medications. The percentages of youth receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment while receiving their initial antipsychotic medication ranged from 7.19% (aripiprazole) to 9.89% (quetiapine) (\u03c7(2) = 0.79, df = 4, P = .94). As compared with risperidone, the adjusted hazard ratio of psychiatric hospital admission was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.57-1.61) for olanzapine, 1.03 (95% CI: 0.59-1.81) for quetiapine, 0.85 (95% CI: 0.43-1.70) for aripiprazole, and 1.22 (95% CI: 0.60-2.51) for ziprasidone. The results suggest that rapid antipsychotic medication discontinuation and psychiatric hospital admission are common in the community treatment of early-onset schizophrenia. No significant differences were detected in risk of either adverse outcome across 5 commonly prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications.",

PK 11195, an isoquinoline analogue, is one of the ligands of highest TSPO binding affinity. Due to the long biological half life of our photosensitizers, there is a need to label them with a long lived radioisotope, for example I-124. Our objectives are to find translocator protein targeted photosensitizers for both tumor imaging (PET) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). I-PK 11195 is conjugated with the tumor avid photosensitizer HPPH. We find that those two tumor avid components complement each other and make the conjugate molecule even more tumor avid; compared to the photosensitizer itself, the conjugate is found to show improved PDT efficacy. It is concluded that I-PK 11195 can be a good vehicle to deliver radionuclide and photosensitizer to TSPO overexpressed tumor regions. Such conjugates could be useful for both tumor imaging (PET) and PDT.",

The buccal route is to be preferred because of its easy use and high efficacy. A generally accepted policy for early treatment of convulsive seizures is a crucial issue in the elaboration of an overall treatment plan for the child with epilepsy. Such a plan should include instruction and education of the parents and the caregivers surrounding the child.",
