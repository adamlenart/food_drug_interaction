None compared clotiapine with placebo, but control drugs were either antipsychotics (chlorpromazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine and zuclopenthixol acetate) or benzodiazepines (lorazepam). Versus the antipsychotics, the results for 'no important global improvement' did not suggest clotiapine to be superior, or inferior, to chlorpromazine, perphenazine, or trifluoperazine (n = 83, 3 RCTs, RR 0.82 CI 0.22 to 3.05, I-squared 58%). Use of clotiapine when compared with chlorpromazine did change the proportion of people ready for hospital discharge by the end of the study (n = 49, 1 RCT, RR 1.04 95%CI 0.96 to 2.12). Overall, attrition rates were low. No significant difference was found for those allocated to clotiapine compared with people randomised to other antipsychotics (n = 121, RR 2.26 95%CI 0.40 to 13). Weak data suggests that clotiapine may result in less need for antiparkinsonian treatment compared with zuclopenthixol acetate (n = 38, RR 0.43 95%CI 0.02 to 0.98). Compared with lorazepam, clotiapine, when used to control aggressive/violent outbursts for people already treated with haloperidol, did not significantly improve mental state (WMD -3.36 95%CI -8.09 to 1.37).

For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia' GABA agonist drugs were not clearly better than placebo (n = 108, RR 0.83 CI 0.6 to 1.1). Deterioration in mental state was more likely to occur in people receiving GABA medication (n = 95, RR 2.47 CI 1.1 to 5.4), but this effect was influenced by the decision to assign a negative outcome to those who dropped out before the end of the study. A greater proportion of people allocated GABA medication may fail to complete the trial compared with those allocated placebo (20% versus 9%), but this difference was not statistically significant (n = 136, RR 1.99 CI 0.8 to 4.7). There is a suggestion of an increase in ataxia (loss of power of muscular coordination) for both baclofen and sodium valproate (n = 95, RR 3.26 CI 0.4 to 30.2), and in sedation (n = 113, RR 2.12 CI 0.8 to 5.4) compared with placebo, but this was not significant.

    "14": "Tumor cell targeted therapies, by induction or enhancement of apoptosis, constitute recent promising approaches achieving more specific anti-tumor efficacy. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which belongs to the permeability transition pore (PTP), the central regulatory complex of apoptosis, is a potential target. A number of findings argue in favor of the development of PBR targeting approaches: (i) overexpression of PBR has been described in a large range of human cancers, (ii) PTP-mediated regulation of programmed cell death is an apoptotic-inducing factor-independent check-point that could be modulated by various conventional cancer therapies, and (iii) PBR ligation enhances apoptosis induction in many types of tumors and reverses Bcl-2 cytoprotective effects. Altogether, these observations support the use of PBR-directed drugs, particularly PBR ligands such as Ro5-4864, in the treatment of human cancers.", 
    "15": "The poor quality of oral health care for people with intellectual disability (ID) has been recognized, and the strong fears about dental treatment suggested as a major reason for disturbances of visits to dentists by such patients. Intravenous sedation is a useful method for relieving the anxiety and fear of such patients about dental treatment, and is frequently essential for ID patients undergoing dental treatment. However, decision regarding the dose of sedative required to be administered for an adequate level of sedation is difficult because the effect of sedation cannot be adequately assessed in patients with severe ID. As an appropriate sedative dose for dental patients with ID has not been fully established, we investigated sedative doses required and the effect of sedation in patients with ID, compared with other dental patients.", 
    "16": "We reviewed the anaesthetic records of dental patients with ID (73 cases) and other dental patients (19 cases) aged between 20 and 29 years who had undergone intravenous sedation with midazolam and propofol in Okayama University Dental Hospital, from January 2000 to December 2000. Intravenous sedation was induced with a bolus intravenous administration of midazolam (2-3 mg) and maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol. The dose of propofol was titrated to achieve an adequate level of sedation: asleep but responding to painful stimulation. The efficacy of sedation, the required doses of propofol, and the wake-up times were investigated for all subjects. The efficacy of sedation was evaluated by judging whether the patient became cooperative and allowed the dental treatment to be carried out or not. The complications induced by intravenous sedation were also evaluated in each subject. Differences in variables between subjects with ID and other subjects were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.", 
    "17": "Intravenous sedation was effective for dental treatment in all subjects with or without ID. The required dose of propofol in subjects with ID was 4.74 mg/kg/h (2.63-10.33 mg/kg/h), significantly higher than that required for other subjects (3.31, 1.72-4.80 mg/kg/h). Wake-up times of subjects with ID were similar to those of the other subjects. Severe complications were not seen during or after intravenous sedation.", 
    "18": "The results of this study show that intravenous sedation is a useful method for dental patients with ID as well as for other dental patients, but indicate that dental patients with ID need higher doses of sedative to obtain an adequate level of sedation.", 
    "19": "Chemotherapy-induced delayed emesis (DE) can affect up to 50% to 70% of patients receiving moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy, although rates are improving. DE most commonly occurs within the first 24 to 48 hours of chemotherapy administration and can persist for 2 to 5 days. Olanzapine, due to its activity at multiple dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, and histaminic receptor sites, has potential as antiemetic therapy. A phase I study was designed with olanzapine, using a four-cohort dose escalation of 3 to 6 patients per cohort, for the prevention of DE in cancer patients receiving their first cycle of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, platinum, and/or irinotecan. All patients received standard premedication. Olanzapine was administered on days -2 and -1 prior to chemotherapy and continued for 8 days (days 0-7). Episodes of vomiting as well as daily measurements of nausea, sedation, and toxicity were monitored at each dose level. Fifteen patients completed the protocol. No grade 4 toxicities were seen, and three patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3) of a depressed level of consciousness during the study. The maximum tolerated dose appeared to be 5 mg (for days -2 and -1) and 10 mg (for days 0-7). Four of six patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin, > or = 70 mg/m2) and nine of nine patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (doxorubicin, > or = 50 mg/m2) had complete control (no vomiting episodes) of DE. Therefore, olanzapine may be an effective agent for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced DE. A phase II trial is underway.", 
    "20": "Several studies have suggested that the antipsychotic compound, cyamemazine, possesses anxiolytic properties in humans. The original pharmacological profile of cyamemazine (D(2), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C), and 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist), which was established by binding, microdialysis and behavioral studies, is consistent with these observations. In the light/dark exploration test, cyamemazine demonstrated anxiolytic-like activity by acute, but not chronic administration. By chronic administration, however, cyamemazine increased the time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (EPM) test demonstrating anxiolytic-like activity. The discrepancy between the results obtained in these tests by acute and chronic administration, could be due to a combination of dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism with antagonism of the 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(3) receptors. The action of cyamemazine on both the dopaminergic system and 5-HT(3) receptors could also explain the activity of cyamemazine in the management of alcohol withdrawal demonstrated in preclinical studies. This potential indication for cyamemazine and its activity in benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have recently been investigated in clinical trials and the results of these studies are presented in this review.", 
    "21": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18-kDa protein receptor mainly found on the outer mitochondrial membrane of cells. The PBR plays a role in several cellular functions including haem synthesis, steroidogenesis, DNA synthesis, cell growth and differentiation, and apoptosis. PBR expression in normal skin correlates with proliferating, secretory and differentiated cellular structures. Increased or aberrant expression of PBR has been associated with aggressive behaviour in several tumour types including ovarian, colon and breast adenocarcinomas and glioblastoma.", 
    "22": "To determine whether changes in normal PBR distribution would be useful as markers for skin cancers or possible target sites for therapies such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate PBR expression and distribution in normal and photodamaged skin (actinic keratoses), skin cancers (in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinomas and superficial, nodular, morphoeiform and mixed pattern basal cell carcinomas) and several benign epithelial proliferations.", 
    "23": "A rabbit polyclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide fragment of the PBR was developed and characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. The antibody was used to stain formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples (n = 157) by a routine avidin-biotin immunohistochemical technique. Sections were evaluated for antibody localization, distribution (0-4+) and reaction intensity (negative to strong).", 
    "24": "Normal skin stained with a strong homogeneous positive reaction (3-4+) in the spinous and granular layers (with a gradient corresponding to increasing differentiation), the pilosebaceous units, eccrine gland ducts, endothelial cells and pilar muscle. In cutaneous neoplasms and other skin diseases, a heterogeneous pattern (0-4+) of PBR expression at lower intensity was seen depending on tumour type and degree of differentiation. PBR expression was greatest in well-differentiated tumours, synonymous with the PBR expression gradient seen in normal skin; and least in poorly differentiated and infiltrative tumour types.", 
    "25": "The haem biosynthetic pathway has been harnessed for PDT of skin carcinomas by application of exogenous aminolaevulinic acid to generate the endogenous photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Owing to the role of PBR as a transporter of haem precursors in haem synthesis, PBR density and distribution in skin cancers could be a predictor of the capacity for PpIX production and subsequent response to PDT in skin cancers.",

In initial blinded trial outcomes, relative responses (> or = 50% improvement of mania) to olanzapine/placebo were similar in RC and non-RC subjects, though early responses to olanzapine favored RC over non-RC subjects (p = .003), and long-term outcomes favored non-RC subjects (p = .05). Fewer RC subjects achieved strictly defined initial symptomatic remission (p = .014) within a year; RC subjects were more likely to experience recurrences (p = .002), especially of depressive illness (< .001), and had more rehospitalizations (p = .01) and suicide attempts (p = .03).", 
    "29": "RC bipolar I patients showed major initial differences and more rapid initial clinical changes, especially toward depression, with less favorable long-term outcomes than non-RC cases during treatment with olanzapine.

    "30": "The most important and serious neuropsychiatric disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) are the medication-induced psychoses. They are remarkably frequent and are linked to a dopaminergic over-stimulation caused by the drugs administered over a long period of time. This complication increases the morbidity and mortality rates in PD and in the past it was very difficult to treat. Yet, the atypical antipsychotics have transformed its prognosis.", 
    "31": "We review the general pharmacology of the atypical antipsychotics, in particular clozapine and olanzapine, which we have wide experience with. We present two series in which these drugs were used with the psychosis in PD. Our studies were performed using a strict prospective methodology, with scales that are valid for psychosis, and the patients' motor signs. Both atypical antipsychotics were seen to improve the positive and negative symptoms of the patients, giving rise to no or scarce improvement of the motor signs of PD. The side effects of the two drugs were not important. Our two series are compared with others from the literature, with similar results as regards the improvements in the psychoses and the absence or only slight deterioration of Parkinson's disease.", 
    "32": "The psychoses induced by medication in PD are frequent and severe.

    "39": "Most children with SE admitted to PIC are aged less than 5 years, male to female ratio 1:1, and most (77%) will have had no previous episodes of SE. Prolonged febrile convulsions, SE related to central nervous system infection, and SE associated with epilepsy occur in similar proportions. Contrary to the Advanced Paediatric Life Support guidelines many children admitted to PIC for SE receive over two doses, or inadequate doses, of benzodiazepine. There is a risk of respiratory depression following administration of over two doses of benzodiazepine (chi2 = 3.4, p = 0.066). Children with SE admitted to PIC who had prehospital emergency treatment are more likely to receive over two doses of benzodiazepines (chi2 = 11.5, p = 0.001), and to subsequently develop respiratory insufficiency (chi2 = 6.2, p = 0.01). Mortality is low. Further study is required to determine the morbidity associated with SE in childhood requiring intensive care.",

Using different existing analytical methods several studies have already identified a variety of drugs in waste-, surface- and drinking water. The monitoring of surface waters for drugs is of great importance because drugs are designed to be biological very active substances. A capillary LC/ES-MS-MS method has been developed that enables the sensitive and specific detection of diazepam in water samples up to 0.1 ng/ml (LOD). It requires neither multiple extraction steps, nor the use of large volumes of organic solvent. Applying this assay we have detected diazepam in 'in/effluent samples' collected in Belgium and demonstrated the applicability for water analysis without off-line pre-concentration of the analyte.", 
    "42": "Are androgens reinforcing? Androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) are drugs of abuse. They are taken in large quantities by athletes and others to increase performance, often with negative long-term health consequences. As a result, in 1991, testosterone was declared a controlled substance. Recently, Brower [K.J. Brower, Anabolic steroid abuse and dependence. Curr. Psychiatry Rep. 4 (2002) 377-387.] proposed a two-stage model of AAS dependence. Users initiate steroid use for their anabolic effects on muscle growth. With continued exposure, dependence on the psychoactive effects of AAS develops. However, it is difficult in humans to separate direct psychoactive effects of AAS from the user's psychological dependence on the anabolic effects of AAS. Thus, studies in laboratory animals are useful to explore androgen reinforcement. Testosterone induces a conditioned place preference in rats and mice, and is voluntarily consumed through oral, intravenous, and intracerebroventricular self-administration in hamsters. Active, gonad-intact male and female hamsters will deliver 1 microg/microl testosterone into the lateral ventricles. Indeed, some individuals self-administer testosterone intracerebroventricularly to the point of death. Male rats develop a conditioned place preference to testosterone injections into the nucleus accumbens, an effect blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists. These data suggest that androgen reinforcement is mediated by the brain. Moreover, testosterone appears to act through the mesolimbic dopamine system, a common substrate for drugs of abuse. Nonetheless, androgen reinforcement is not comparable to that of cocaine or heroin. Instead, testosterone resembles other mild reinforcers, such as caffeine, nicotine, or benzodiazepines. The potential for androgen addiction remains to be determined.", 
    "43": "Mutations in GABA-A receptor subunits have been reported in a number of idiopathic generalized epilepsies including childhood absence epilepsy. One of these mutations is located within a high-affinity benzodiazepine-binding domain, and clonazepam is clinically used as an anti-absence drug. The intrathalamic loop consisting of the GABAergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) and the thalamocortical (TC) neurons of sensory thalamic nuclei plays an essential role in spike and wave discharges. In a well-established genetic model of absence epilepsy (Genetic Absence Epilepsy rat from Strasbourg, GAERS), systemic injections of benzodiazepines have been shown to suppress spike-and-waves discharges. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whether the sensitivity of GABAergic synaptic currents to clonazepam in NRT and TC neurons was different in GAERS and non-epileptic control (NEC) rats. In both pre-seizure GAERS and NEC clonazepam (100 nM) had no effect on the mIPSCs recorded from TC neurons while it increased the decay time constant of the mIPSCs recorded in NRT neurons by a similar amount in GAERS (54.5+/-5%) and NEC (50.7+/-5%). Similar results have been obtained in the presence of 100 microM Cd2+, showing that the effect of clonazepam did not occur via modulation of voltage-activated Ca2+ currents. These results are relevant to understand that in GAERS, the clonazepam anti-absence actions cannot be fully explained by the enhancement of the intra-NRT inhibition and the modulation of the GABAergic synaptic currents in other brain areas, in particular the cortex, must be taken into consideration.", 
    "44": "Dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid, which can induce a range of mood disorders including depression and affective psychosis, is toxic to specific hippocampal and striatal neuronal populations. Chronic administration of antidepressants can induce neuroprotective effects, potentially by raising cellular levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We accordingly tested the hypothesis that chronic pretreatment of rats (Sprague-Dawley, male) with antidepressants would attenuate dexamethasone-induced neuronal damage as revealed by reductions in the level of neuronal death and in sublethal neuronal damage shown by the increase in the number of MAP-2 immunoreactive neurons. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that chronic treatment with a range of antidepressants prior to dexamethasone administration (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the levels of neuronal death and loss of MAP-2 immunoreactivity in both the hippocampus and striatum. The antidepressants used were: desipramine (8 mg/kg, i.p., tricyclic), fluoxetine (8 mg/kg, i.p., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg, i.p., monoamine oxidase inhibitor) with each drug being injected once per day for 10 days. In contrast, acute injection of none of the antidepressants exerted a protective effect from dexamethasone-associated neuronal damage. Similarly, injection of neither cocaine nor chlordiazepoxide (benzodiazepine) exerted protective effects when injected either chronically or acutely. The observed protection from dexamethasone-induced neuronal damage is in keeping with the potential of chronic antidepressant medication to increase BDNF levels. The potential for dexamethasone to induce disorders of mood by damaging specific neuronal populations in the hippocampus and dorsomedial striatum is discussed.",

    "49": "100 patients without a history of cardiac disease undergoing diagnostic FOB were investigated in a prospective-randomized design. After premedication with intramuscular atropine (0.01 mg/kg BW) patients received sedation with either propofol (group P, n = 50) or midazolam (group M, n = 50). Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation (psaO (2)) and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to and immediately after induction of sedation, when at the level of vocal cords, during the interventional diagnostic procedure (IDP) and 15 min after the end of the FOB.", 
    "50": "The mean heart rate and systolic pressure were significantly lower in group P when compared with group M when at the level of vocal cords and during the IDP (p < 0.05). The total incidence of major arrhythmias was 10 % and the incidence of minor arrhythmias was 62 %. A decline in psaO (2) < 90 % occurred in 16 patients of group M and 5 patients of group P (p = 0.44).",

    "52": "Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic with a novel method of action, has only recently been awarded a license in the UK. We report our first patient to receive this drug, who had treatment-resistant schizophrenia and developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with aripiprazole. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report involving aripiprazole and NMS in a potentially fatal medical emergency. Further experience with this drug should indicate whether this is an isolated case (as described with other atypical antipsychotics) or constitutes a more serious risk than that suggested by the relatively beneficial therapeutic profile described in the literature to date.", 
    "53": "Despite most studies of antipsychotic efficacy and safety having been conducted in young patients with schizophrenia, antipsychotic agents are often prescribed in elderly subjects with psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to document and describe the level of antipsychotic exposure among elderly subjects. We used the Regional Administrative Database of Lombardy, a region of northern Italy with more than 1.6 million elderly inhabitants, to extract all antipsychotic prescriptions dispensed during 2001 to subjects aged 65 years or above. Prevalence data were calculated by dividing antipsychotic users by the total number of male and female residents in each age group. During the 12 months surveyed 35 363 subjects received at least one antipsychotic prescription, yielding a prevalence of use of 2.18 subjects per 100 inhabitants (95% confidence interval 2.16-2.20). Almost two-thirds were prescribed first-generation agents only, and thioridazine, a first-generation agent associated with prolonged QTC interval, and which is restricted in most European countries, was the most prescribed agent. However, risperidone and olanzapine accounted for 30% of antipsychotic use for all subjects. The majority of patients were also prescribed agents for medical disorders. Because the population of Lombardy is approximately one-sixth of the entire Italian population, it can be assumed that there are over 200 000 elderly subjects annually exposed to these agents in Italy. This generates particular concern because elderly patients are vulnerable to the adverse effects of antipsychotics, and recent warnings have indicated that there are cerebrovascular risks associated with risperidone and olanzapine therapy.", 
    "54": "Cardiac adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics have gained increasing interest in recent years. In the present study, heart rate variability (HRV), which is a sensitive parameter reflecting central autonomic cardiac control, was investigated during treatment with olanzapine. Ten physically healthy male patients with schizophrenia, who displayed predominantly negative symptoms, were studied in the sleep laboratory under drug-free baseline conditions and after 4 weeks of olanzapine medication. HRV was assessed during different sleep stages both in the time and frequency domains. Only slight changes in HRV were shown during treatment, and appeared to be independent of sleep stages. Spectral analysis indicated a slight shift of the sympathovagal balance in favour of the sympathetic tone, which was consistent with an elevation of heart rate in the time domain; total HRV was not altered. These changes are in accordance with olanzapine's receptor profile exerting anticholinergic and anti-adrenergic properties. In conclusion, taken together with findings from previous studies demonstrating that olanzapine does not cause clinically significant changes of the QTc interval, the present results are consistent with the known cardiac safety profile of olanzapine.",

However, for prescription drugs that might cause impairment (e.g. benzodiazepines) additional proof is needed to justify prosecution, such as whether the medication was being misused. Over a 2-year period, we found 94 cases of DUID in which the concentrations of diazepam in blood was 1.1 microg/g or more. Diazepam (D) and nordiazepam (ND) were determined in whole blood by capillary gas chromatography with a limit of quantitation of 0.05 microg/g for each compound. The mean (median) and maximum concentrations of D were 2.0 microg/g (1.7 microg/g) and 7.8 microg/g and the corresponding ND concentrations were 1.5 microg/g (1.0 microg/g) and 7.6 microg/g, respectively. The concentration of D in blood exceeded 2 microg/g in 21% of cases and was over 3.0 microg/g in 11% of cases. D and ND were the only drugs present in eight cases (seven men and one women) and in another five cases ethanol was present at concentrations ranging from 0.81 to 1.98 mg/g. Polydrug use was very common in these DUID suspects and D and ND coexisted with amphetamine in 20% of cases, tetrahydrocannabinol in 18% of cases and with both these illicit drugs in 12% of cases. The next most prevalent drug combination was D, ND and morphine (mostly derived from heroin), seen in 13% of cases. Other psychoactive prescription drugs were identified in blood including alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, zolpidem and zopiclone. This case series of DUID suspects demonstrate the high frequency of polydrug use showing preference for illicit drugs like amphetamine, cannabis and heroin, in that order. Furthermore, Swedish traffic delinquents frequently overdose with prescription drugs as exemplified here by unusually high concentrations of D and its active metabolite ND.",

We examined all falls in an institution during the period of 19 months. Patients who carry out daily tasks on a semi-independent level were most at risk. The main risk-factor was dementia. Medication did not prove a major risk-factor. At 37% p. a. the risk of falling was lower than in previous studies. This was due to a restriction on benzodiazepines with short term effects, minimising of neuroleptics, diuretics and other types of antihypertensives as well as avoidance of polypharmacy. Unavoidable risks need to be identified and should result in use of a hip protector.",

Cumulative concentration-response curves were obtained for (+)-cis-dioxolane (cD), a nonspecific muscarinic agonist, at 10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L, in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10(-7) mol/L). Results were normalized to cross sectional area. A repeat concentration-response curve was obtained after incubation of the muscle for 90 min with antagonists for M1 (pirenzepine), M2 (methoctramine) and M3 (darifenacin) muscarinic receptor subtypes. The sensitivity to PTX was tested by the ip injection of 100 mg/kg of PTX 5 d before the experiment. The antral circular smooth muscles were removed from PTX-treated and non-treated rats as strips and dispersed smooth muscle cells to identify whether PTX-linked pathway mediated the contractility to bethanechol.", 
    "59": "A dose-dependent contractile response observed with bethanechol, was not affected by TTX. The pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin decreased the contraction induced by bethanechol. Lack of calcium as well as the presence of the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, also inhibited the cholinergic contraction, with a reduction in response from 2.5+/-0.4 g/mm2 to 1.2+/-0.4 g/mm(2) (P<0.05). The dose-response curves were shifted to the right by muscarinic antagonists in the following order of affinity: darifenacin (M(3))>methocramine (M(2)) >pirenzepine (M(1)).",

The presence of the residual contractile response after the treatment with nifedipine, suggests that an additional pathway could mediate the cholinergic contraction. The involvement of more than one muscarinic receptor (functionally predominant type 3 over type 2) also suggests more than one pathway mediating the cholinergic contraction in rat antrum.",

The aim was to assess whether lorazepam would affect the learning processes and/or whether the participants would be aware of the amnesic difficulty. A total of 30 healthy volunteers participated in the study, 15 of whom received a capsule containing the lorazepam drug (0.038 mg/kg) and 15 a placebo capsule. First, the accuracy of delayed judgments of learning (JOL) was measured in both groups. For the JOL ratings, results showed that all the participants benefited from word repetition. Although the overall performance was lower in the lorazepam than in the placebo group, the accuracy of the JOL ratings was preserved by the drug. Second, all the participants benefited from the repetition of learning, although the performances of the lorazepam-treated subjects remained lower than those of the placebo participants. The repetition of learning had an effect on JOL in both groups. Finally, the time spent learning each (allocation study time) pair of words was measured. For the placebo group, results revealed that study time decreased significantly with the frequency of presentation. For the lorazepam group, no effect of presentation frequency was found. Overall, our findings suggest that the lorazepam drug has a differential effect on the monitoring and the control processes involved in a learning task. The implications of these findings are discussed within the theoretical framework of metacognition.", 
    "70": "The specific cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms mediating the biotransformations of clobazam (CLB) and those of its major metabolites, N-desmethylclobazam (NCLB) and 4'-hydroxyclobazam were identified using cDNA-expressed P450 and P450-specific chemical inhibitors. Among the 13 cDNA-expressed P450 isoforms tested, CLB was mainly demethylated by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 and 4'-hydroxylated by CYP2C19 and CYP2C18. CYP2C19 and CYP2C18 catalyzed the 4'-hydroxylation of NCLB. The kinetics of the major biotransformations were studied: CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 mediated the formation of NCLB with Km = 29.0, 31.9, and 289 microM, Vmax = 6.20, 1.15, and 5.70 nmol/min/nmol P450, and intrinsic clearance (CLint) = 214, 36.1, and 19.7 microl/min/nmol P450, respectively. NCLB was hydroxylated to 4'-hydroxydesmethylclobazam by CYP2C19 with Km = 5.74 microM, Vmax = 0.219 nmol/min/nmol P450, and CLint = 38.2 microl/min/nmol P450 (Hill coefficient = 1.54). These findings were supported by chemical inhibition studies in human liver microsomes. Indeed, ketoconazole (1 microM) inhibited the demethylation of CLB by 70% and omeprazole (10 microM) by 19%; omeprazole inhibited the hydroxylation of NCLB by 26%. Twenty-two epileptic patients treated with CLB were genotyped for CYP2C19. The NCLB/CLB plasma metabolic ratio was significantly higher in the subjects carrying one CYP2C19*2 mutated allele than in those carrying the wild-type genotype. CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the main P450s involved in clobazam metabolism. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by these P450s can occur; moreover, the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism could be responsible for interindividual variations of plasma concentrations of N-desmethylclobazam and thus for occurrence of adverse events.",

Kahlbaum's (1874/1973) original conception, is based on similarities between catatonia and tonic immobility (\"death feint\") as well as evidence that catatonia is associated with anxiety and agitated depression and responds dramatically to benzodiazepines. It is argued that catatonia originally derived from ancestral encounters with carnivores whose predatory instincts were triggered by movement but is now inappropriately expressed in very different modern threat situations. Found in a wide range of psychiatric and serious medical conditions, catatonia may represent a common \"end state\" response to feelings of imminent doom and can serve as a template to understand other psychiatric disorders.", 
    "78": "A large number of methods are available for modeling quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). We examine the predictive accuracy of several methods applied to data sets of inhibitors for angiotensin converting enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, benzodiazepine receptor, cyclooxygenase-2, dihydrofolate reductase, glycogen phosphorylase b, thermolysin, and thrombin. Descriptors calculated with CoMFA, CoMSIA, EVA, HQSAR, and traditional 2D and 2.5D descriptors were used for developing models with partial least squares (PLS). In addition, the genetic function approximation algorithm, genetic PLS, and back-propagation neural networks were used for deriving models from 2.5D descriptors (i.e., 2D descriptors and 3D descriptors calculated from CORINA structures and Gasteiger-Marsili charges). Predictive accuracy was assessed using designed test sets. It was found that HQSAR generally performs as well as CoMFA and CoMSIA; other descriptor sets performed less well. When 2.5D descriptors were used, only neural network ensembles were found to be similarly or more predictive than PLS models. In addition, we show that many cross-validation procedures yield similar estimates of the interpolative accuracy of methods. However, the lack of correspondence between cross-validated and test set predictive accuracy for four sets underscores the benefit of using designed test sets.",

Flu was also tested in combination with atropine sulfate and diazepam. In this case, although only some results reach statistical significance, an encouraging general trend toward an improvement of the anticonvulsant, neuroprotective and antilethal capacities of this classical anti-OP two-drug regimen is constantly observed. In the light of these findings, it seems premature to definitely reject (or recommend) Flu as a possible adjuvant medication against soman poisoning.

Subchronic (7 days) administration of olanzapine had no effect on cell proliferation in hippocampus or prelimbic cortex, consistent with the time course for the effect of fluoxetine and the therapeutic actions of antidepressant treatment. The combination of olanzapine plus fluoxetine did not result in a greater induction of cell proliferation in either brain region.

Intensive care procedures should not be systematical in convulsive SE (CSE) and are not indicated in non-convulsive SE (NCSE). Generalized CSE mostly involve SMEI before 3 years of age, symptomatic generalized epilepsy and partial lesional epilepsy. Treatment is an emergency and relies on IV benzodiazepines and, if necessary, IV phenytoine using plasmatic concentrations for an optimal management. The partial CSE of partial lesional epilepsy can result in focal deficit and need the same treatment as generalized CSE. NCSE consist in absence and/or myoclonic SE and are often unrecognised during a long time until EEG is performed. They mostly involve myoclonic epilepsies and can be controlled by IV benzodiazepines. The frequency of partial NCSE is underestimated, particularly in infants. Diagnosis relies on video EEG and treatment is the same as that used in partial CSE.", 
    "86": "In a first phase of this investigation, a validation of our elevated plus-maze apparatus was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats by testing anxiety response at various ambient light intensities (200, 30, 10 and 2.5 lux), as well as the effects of diazepam treatment (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p. at 30 lux). Anxiety responses were found to decrease with decreasing light intensity and to be attenuated by diazepam treatment. Subsequently, a separate set of rats was exposed to 2.45 GHz EMFs (2 micros pulse width, 500 pulses per second, whole-body and time averaged of SAR 0.6 W/kg +/-2 dB, brain-averaged SAR of 0.9 W/kg +/-3 dB) for 45 min to assess whether EMF exposure altered anxiety responses in the same apparatus. As we made no a priori hypothesis on whether the effects would be anxiogenic or anxiolytic, part of the rats were tested under an ambient light intensity of 2.5 lux, the other one being tested at 30 lux. The low intensity level set the behavioural baseline for the detection of anxiogenic effects, while the higher one corresponded to the detection of anxiolytic effects. Sham-exposed and naive rats were used as controls. Whatever light intensity was used, EMF exposure failed to induce any significant effect on anxiety responses in the plus maze. The present experiment demonstrates that exposure to EMFs, which was previously found to increase the number of benzodiazepine receptors in the rat cortex [Lai H, Carino MA, Horita A, Guy AW. Single vs. repeated microwave exposure: effects on benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of the rat.

The signaling pathways leading to cell cycle arrest are still unknown. Using cDNA array technology, we identified signaling molecules involved in cell cycle arrest induced by the PBR ligands FGIN-1-27 and PK 11195. Differential gene expression was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR or Western blot analysis of gene products. The PBR ligand-mediated signaling involved the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27Kip1, cdc16, and the cell cycle inhibitors gadd45 and gadd153, the downregulation of the cyclins D1 and B1, as well as the inactivation of ERK1/2. The p21-deficient colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 p21-/- was significantly less sensitive to PBR ligands than the parental HCT116 wild-type cells, demonstrating the functional involvement of p21WAF1/CIP1 in PBR ligand-mediated G1 arrest. This study thus revealed PBR ligand-triggered signaling pathways leading to cell cycle arrest. Moreover, we showed the functional implication and interaction of differentially expressed gene products and provided a model of signaling pathways involved in PBR ligand-induced G1 arrest.

The protein level decreases between the double negative and double positive stages, and then increases when thymocytes become single positive. We addressed the role played by PBR in T-cell maturation. To this aim, we used Jurkat cells, which are immature T lymphocytes derived from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These cells are PBR negative and were stably transfected to achieve PBR levels similar to that in mature T cells. Using the DNA chip technology, we analyzed the PBR expression-dependent gene changes and evidenced that PBR-expressing cells exhibited more mature features than mock-transfected ones. A majority of the modulated genes encode proteins playing direct or indirect roles during the lymphocyte maturation process. In particular, PBR expression induced several differentiation markers (such as CD1, CD6), or key regulating elements (e.g., RAG1, RAG2, CD99, TCR). By contrast, some regulators of TCR signaling were reduced. PBR expression also affected the expression of critical apoptosis regulators: the proapoptotic lipocortin I, galectin-1, and galectin-9 were reduced while the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 was induced. Altogether our results supported the hypothesis that PBR controls T-cell maturation and suggested mechanisms through which PBR may regulate thymocyte-positive selection.", 
    "97": "The treatment of anxiety cannot be considered a solved problem, therefore, efforts are directed towards the development of novel treatment approaches. Increasing evidence suggests, however, that the efficacy of available treatments can be improved by taking into account the yet poorly known interactions between psychosocial conditions and the efficacy of pharmacological treatments. We review here evidence demonstrating that psychosocial factors affect the properties and function of receptors that mediate the effects of clinically available anxiolytics. Such neuronal changes affect the efficacy of anxiolytics, which consequently depends largely on psychosocial factors. We show that the interaction between psychosocial factors and drug responsiveness is clinically relevant. Laboratory studies predict that (i) the frequent exposure of subjects to acute stressors lowers the efficacy of benzodiazepines and buspirone, but increases the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); (ii) the anxiolytic efficacy of buspirone is largely affected by social support and stability, whereas (iii) the efficacy of SSRIs is larger in subjects experiencing early maltreatment. Laboratory studies also show that the side effects of compounds decrease under certain conditions. Disparate human studies suggest that such predictions are clinically valid. Thus, further research on the relationship between psychosocial (Axis-IV) factors and drug efficacy would lead to substantial therapeutic progress with the available anxiolytic compounds. This interaction should be in focus also when new therapeutic approaches are developed.", 
    "98": "Considerable research with animals indicates that the GABA-benzodiazepine (BZ) system plays a key role in alcohol reinforcement. However, only limited research appears to have assessed this issue directly in humans. The present study investigated whether low-dose diazepam would cross-prime motivation for alcohol in problem drinkers. Twelve male problem drinkers (Alcohol Dependence Scale; ADS score > or =9) received oral diazepam (5 mg) and placebo, in a counterbalanced manner on separate sessions. There were three measures of primed motivation for alcohol: self-reported desire for alcohol, consumption of placebo beer in an ostensible taste test procedure, and automatically executed vocal reading responses to Alcohol versus Neutral words on a computer-based task. Diazepam significantly increased beer consumption, and produced a marginally significant increase in reported desire for alcohol. On the reading task, diazepam significantly decreased response latency to Alcohol words relative to Neutral words. Latency to Alcohol words correlated significantly with beer consumption under the drug. Moreover, response latency to Alcohol words under the drug also predicted ADS scores. Thus, severity of dependence was directly linked with vulnerability to a BZ priming effect on motivation for alcohol. These findings provide direct evidence that the GABA-BZ system plays an important role in alcohol reinforcement in problem drinkers.",

Time of laryngeal mask or tracheal tube insertion is longer but may be reduced by adding N(2)O and/or a low opioid dose. The interest of benzodiazepine as premedication is not established but is highly probable when considering its potentiating effect on halogenated agents. Without any adjuvant, inhalation induction maintains spontaneous ventilation better than propofol. This justifies favouring this technique when difficult intubation is anticipated. This technique is associated to less or similar cardiovascular effects than intravenous propofol. However, some patients exhibit dramatic tachycardia and arterial pressure increase that should lead to caution in cardiovascular disabled patients. This sympathetic hyperactivity occurs with epileptiform EEG activity that was never associated with postanaesthesia mental dysfunction. In aged or cardiac patients, by reducing sevoflurane concentrations from 8% to 2% (or by 2% decreasing steps), the cardiovascular effect of this inhalation induction is better than propofol.

Significant treatment-time differences were detected in the duration of LRR, post-LRR ataxia, and total pharmacological response duration. The longest pharmacological response occurred in rats injected during the light (rest) phase, and the shortest pharmacological response occurred in rats injected during the dark (activity) phase. Cosinor analysis documented circadian rhythmicity in the duration of post-LRR ataxia.

We report on a man completely remitted from panic disorder after olanzapine and paroxetine combined treatment, and the possible modulating anti-anxiety effect of olanzapine is discussed. Olanzapine augmentation in panic and other anxiety disorders is deserving of more clinical attention.", 
    "107": "Depressive episodes are significant in bipolar illness since patients can spend up to one-third of their lives in depression. Although the treatment of bipolar depression remains an understudied area, new data from randomized, controlled trials and naturalistic studies have expanded the range of treatments available. The main aim in the treatment of bipolar depression is the prevention of the patient switching to mania and cycle acceleration, and antidepressant therapy may be contraindicated because of the risk for switching. Guidelines for the acute treatment of bipolar depression emphasize treatment with a mood stabilizer, of which lithium has been the most thoroughly studied in randomized, controlled trials in acute bipolar depression. Lamotrigine has also demonstrated significant efficacy in recent studies and has been approved by the FDA.", 
    "108": "The acute pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders is barely specific with the exception of the obsessive-compulsive disorder: it responds preferentially to potent serotoninergic antidepressants only. For all other anxiety disorders all antidepressants regardless of their mechanism of action could be equally efficient thanks to their common class effect and are considered to be the pharmacological treatment of first choice. Benzodiazepines that also share a common class effect are recommended as possible and temporary adjuvants. Augmentation strategies for the cases of refractory anxiety disorders are also non-specific: lithium, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants.", 
    "109": "This article reviews the literature concerning addiction to benzodiazepine (BZD) in the elderly population of 65 and over. While the negative consequences related to a prolonged use of BZD are well known, much less is known on the phenomenon of dependency to these substances in this population. There is still no consensus on the definition of the problem. The continuous use of BZD may be more problematic in the elderly for whom tolerance to chemical agents diminishes with age. The risk factors involved in the chronic use are an interactive combination between the characteristics of the elderly as well as the physicians who prescribe such medication. Paths of research to support a paradigmatic change are presented in order to improve the research in this field.", 
    "110": "The efficacy of a new cognitive-behavioral group program to help discontinuation of benzodiazepines (PASSE) was evaluated by comparison to a group receiving only social support. Both programs lasted 20 weeks commencing with a preparatory period of one month and then tapering continually during 16 subsequent weeks until discontinuation. Forty-eight participants (24 in each condition) with a diagnosis of anxiety disorder took part in the study. These two active conditions were compared with a separate group of 41 people receiving standard tapering with physician counselling only. The results post-treatment supported the hypothesis that those receiving either of the two active treatments succeeded better in discontinuing benzodiazepines than those receiving the standard treatment. Among those completing the two active programs there was no difference in outcome between the social support and the cognitive behavioral (PASSE) group. However, when the rate of dropout was considered, the cognitive-behavioral group proved significantly superior than the social support group. The results suggest that a cognitive-behavioral program can help people wishing to discontinue benzodiazepines to psychologically tolerate the immediate effects of discontinuation.", 
    "111": "Discontinuing the use of benzodiazepine medication can represent a difficult task for some people. High rates of relapses are associated with attempts to stop their use. However, it remains difficult to explain why some people fail in their efforts. The current knowledge suggests the involvement of a psychological component in the difficulty to stop benzodiazepine medication (BZD). Expectations of people who consider stopping their medication has been mentioned as a possible explanation of the failure of the withdrawal process. However, no empirical study has examined the effect of these expectations on the appearance of symptoms during withdrawal or its outcome. This article presents the development of an instrument aiming at assessing personal expectations regarding discontinuation of benzodiazepine medication with individuals who suffer from anxiety. It presents preliminary data related to the clinical validity of items. From 50 initial items, 24 have been eliminated following a first test with some participants. Among 26 chosen items, it has been observed that 8 items (for example, nervousness/anxiety, cognitive capacities, mood) could discriminate between participants having succeeded and those having failed. Generally, it has been observed that participants who have succeeded had expectations that were significantly more positive than people who had failed in their attempt to stop. These preliminary results tend to support the hypothesis according to which negative expectations would harm the BZD withdrawal process. However, these results must be replicated with a greater number of participants.", 
    "112": "Insomnia is a widespread health problem that often leads to the use of hypnotic medication. Among the available pharmacological agents to treat insomnia, benzodiazepines (BZD) present some undesirable effects, entailing risks of tolerance and dependence, and increased risk of automobile accidents, falls and fractures in the elderly. Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) of insomnia, which focuses on psychological and behavioral factors that play a role in maintaining sleep-related problems, is efficient to improve sleep in the elderly who suffer from primary insomnia. This treatment may represent an alternative to pharmacotherapy or again be complementary during discontinuation of hypnotic medication. The CBT of insomnia may include different components such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation, cognitive restructuring and sleep hygiene. For people who are dependent to BZD or other hypnotic medication, a supervised tapering based on attaining successive objectives is generally added to the CBT of insomnia.", 
    "113": "Benzodiazepine medication is often prescribed for the short-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. The chronic nature of generalized anxiety disorder entails a prolonged use of these psychotropic medication on several months and several years, entailing also a psychological and physical addiction. The current study aims at determining if the combination of a behavioral and cognitive therapy and gradual withdrawal facilitate interrupting the use of benzodiazepine in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. In total, five participants have received the combined intervention according to an experimental protocol of unique case with multiple levels. Four among them have completed the withdrawal plan and have demonstrated important clinical improvements. Data collected during the 3rd and 6th month indicate the preservation of therapeutic gain. These results suggest that behavioral and cognitive therapy facilitates stopping the use of benzodiazepine medication in patients with generalized anxiety disorder by significantly reducing anxious symptoms.", 
    "114": "This article summarizes a clinical approach aiming at facilitating withdrawal of benzodiazepines. The authors underline the importance of a medical evaluation in order to identify reasons that have led to the use and maintaining of a pharmacological treatment and to better understand the reasons and motivation of the patient to cease his medication. During this assessment, it is important to inform the patient to gradually reduce his medication in order to diminish the severity of side effects expected during withdrawal. A step by step approach where the patient actively participates in decisions is proposed to reduce the anxiety, but also to prevent the patient from taking unilateral initiatives that would go against an approach aiming at optimizing the success of withdrawal. Some clinical vignettes are presented to illustrate the steps of withdrawal as well as situations where reducing or even stopping medication is difficult.", 
    "115": "Studies conducted with a healthy voluntary population with a unique medication indicate that benzodiazepines (BZD) are known to induce memory deficits. However, this group does not correspond to the population usually using these medication on a regular basis, knowingly the elderly people. Few studies have been conducted with this target population to determine the impact of BZD on their memory. However, some findings suggest that there are important consequences on the functioning of memory of the elderly people taking BZD. The current data go as far as suggesting that BZD exacerbate memory deficits in the elderly. This could even constitute a risk factor that could hasten cognitive decline and thus increase development of dementia.", 
    "116": "Previous studies have not demonstrated good correlations between various presumed phenotypic measures of in vivo cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity. However, in reality, few have used appropriate and validated in vivo probes that consider the complexities of CYP3A. Accordingly, the disposition of 3 closely related benzodiazepines with extensive and similar CYP3A-mediated metabolism characteristics but different pharmacokinetics was investigated, and correlations between the drugs were examined.", 
    "117": "The single-dose oral clearances of alprazolam, midazolam, and triazolam and the systemic clearances of the latter 2 drugs were separately determined in 21 healthy subjects (10 men) according to a randomized experimental design with a minimum 1-week period between the individual studies. An erythromycin breath test was also performed.", 
    "118": "After intravenous administration, systemic clearance varied 3-fold compared with a 6-fold range in clearance after an oral dose for all 3 drugs. However, mean values differed markedly between the drugs, with the systemic clearance of midazolam being almost double that of triazolam (383 +/- 73 mL/min versus 222 +/- 54 mL/min). Oral clearances were even more dissimilar: alprazolam, 75 +/- 36 mL/min; triazolam, 360 +/- 195 mL/min; and midazolam, 533 +/- 759 mL/min. Estimates of CYP3A-mediated extraction by the intestine and liver indicated approximately equal contributions by both organs but larger values for midazolam than for triazolam, and these differences accounted for the differences in oral bioavailability, 30% +/- 13% versus 55% +/- 20%, respectively. Statistically significant ( P = .001 to .004) correlations between the 3 drugs' oral clearances ranged from 0.60 to 0.68 ( r s value), whereas the correlation for the systemic clearances of midazolam and triazolam was 0.66 ( P = .001). No statistically significant relationships were observed between any of the clearance parameters and the erythromycin breath test.", 
    "119": "Despite alprazolam, midazolam, and triazolam having markedly different pharmacokinetic characteristics, statistically significant correlations were present between the oral and systemic clearances of the 3 drugs, consistent with a major involvement of CYP3A in their metabolism and elimination. However, the magnitude of the coefficients of determination ( r s ) was such to suggest that an in vivo probe approach, even with the use of valid phenotypic trait values, will be unable to accurately and reliably predict the pharmacokinetic behavior of another CYP3A substrate, as determined by the enzyme's constitutive activity.",

    "121": "A 69-yr-old 70-kg male underwent orthotopic heart transplant (bicaval anastomosis technique) for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Five months after transplantation, the patient underwent a transurethral bladder tumour resection under spinal anesthesia. Two millilitres of bupivacaine 0.75% (15 mg) were injected intrathecally at L(3-4) and the patient remained seated for approximately 20 sec prior to assuming the lithotomy position. Subsequently, both blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) diminished gradually (BP and HR immediately pre-spinal: 113 mmHg (mean arterial pressure) and 92 beats x min(-1), respectively; nadir BP and HR: 94 mmHg (16.8% decrease) 30 min postspinal and 73 beats x min(-1) (20.7% decrease) 40 min postspinal, respectively). HR and mean BP were highly correlated (r = 0.9410, P < 0.0001, R(2) = 0.8854). The dermatome level of neuraxial anesthesia, determined by sensitivity to pin prick, was T(8) (five minutes) and T(6) (ten minutes) postinjection of spinal anesthetic. Control patients (n = 10) undergoing elective urological procedures with identical anesthesia management demonstrated very similar cardiovascular responses.", 
    "122": "Although cardiac transplant patients may tolerate neuraxial anesthesia admirably, a fall in HR may ensue which theoretically could have important physiological consequences. It is argued that the change in HR in the transplanted patient was mediated by mechanisms intrinsic to the transplanted heart and/or by reduced catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla. It is emphasized that HR changes observed in cardiac transplant patients do not necessarily imply reinnervation of the transplanted organ.", 
    "123": "The GABA(A) receptor gamma2 subunit mutation R43Q is an autosomal dominant mutation associated with childhood absence epilepsy and febrile seizures. Previously, we demonstrated that homozygous alpha1beta3gamma2L(R43Q) receptor whole-cell currents had reduced amplitude with unaltered time course, suggesting reduced cell surface expression of functional receptors. In human embryonic kidney 293-T cells, we demonstrate that both heterozygous and homozygous alpha1beta2gamma2S(R43Q) GABA(A) receptor current amplitudes were reduced when receptors were assembled from coexpressed alpha1, beta2, and gamma2S subunits and from beta2-alpha1 tandem subunits coexpressed with the gamma2L subunit. Using fluorescence confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that mutant receptors containing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged gamma2S subunits had reduced surface expression and were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, using biotinylation of surface receptors and immunoblotting, we confirmed that alpha1beta2gamma2S(R43Q) receptors had reduced surface expression. These results provide evidence that the gamma2S(R43Q) mutation impaired GABA(A) receptor function by compromising receptor trafficking and reducing surface expression.", 
    "124": "Febrile seizures are most common seizures in childhood (2-4%). Children with simple febrile seizures only have a slightly increased risk of epilepsy. Recurrences are common. Diagnostic ascertainment is easy, most evaluations simple, diagnostic routine schedules almost not necessary. Prophylactic antipyretic or anticonvulsant therapies are not recommended. Administration of rectal diazepam at home in case of recurrence is useful. Adequate therapeutical approach also includes physicians guidance and information for the dramatically frightened parents who think their child was about to die. Only complex febrile seizures with high risk of subsequent epilepsy may indicate intermittent diazepam prophylaxis or even continuous anticonvulsant treatment in case of a beginning epileptic syndrome.", 
    "125": "Weight overload and obesity became these last years a major health problem. However gain weight is a frequent side effect of a large number of psychotropics. This article proposes to discuss this potential while reviewing various molecules. This reveals that the atypical antipsychotics are most likely to induce weight gain, in particular clozapine and olanzapine. The tricyclic antidepressants and mirtazapine come next, with the majority of the mood stabilizers. The old antipsychotics seem to involve less gain of weight. The SSRI make lose weight in the first weeks of treatment, but induce a moderate weight gain on the long term.",

Analgesic and anti-stress techniques, which do not affect the intracardial conductivity and ensure the successful outcome of surgery with spontaneous or auxiliary ALV, were designed on the basis of research. The above schemes were introduced in practice with their efficiency being confirmed. They are based on a balanced use of the new-generation non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, like Xephocam, bezodiazepines and fentanyl (when used at subnarcotic doses that do not affect the intracardial conductivity). The main analgesic component of lornoxycam was sufficient when used at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg and at a total dose of equal to or below 16 mg.", 
    "127": "It is well known that sleep disturbance is an integral symptom of schizophrenia. In recent studies, a deficit of delta sleep has been observed in schizophrenic patients. Antipsychotic drugs with serotonin (5-HT2) receptor-antagonistic properties are considered to have delta sleep promoting effects. We have investigated the effects of subchronic olanzapine treatment on sleep EEG in schizophrenic patients.", 
    "128": "The effects of administration of olanzapine (15 to 20 mg) on sleep were studied for four weeks in 10 male, drug-free patients suffering from schizophrenia with predominantly negative symptoms. Conventional sleep EEG parameters were investigated at baseline and after treatment with olanzapine for four weeks. Additionally, spectral power analysis of the EEG signal in distinct frequency bands was computed for different sleep stages. Psychopathology (PANSS, HAMD-17, HAMA) and side effects were assessed weekly.", 
    "129": "All patients improved, as measured by PANSS global scores. Compared to baseline, there was a significant improvement of parameters of sleep efficiency and an increase of delta sleep as well as REM sleep. Regarding spectral power values, no significant differences between baseline and treatment conditions were found.",

    "131": "The prescription of addictive drugs has been a cause for concern. Various small-scale interventions towards patients and doctors have proven effective in terms of cutting down the number of prescriptions. However, little is known about users' experience with withdrawal of addictive drugs; exploring this is the main aim of the present study.", 
    "132": "Six focus group sessions with 27 former high and low dosage drug users, mainly of benzodiazepines, were conducted. All groups were audiotaped and analysed by qualitative methods.", 
    "133": "Five distinct themes emerged: reasons for drug use initiation, experience of being a user, experience related to drug withdrawal, of leading a life without medication, and experience with and expectations from doctors. Our group members pointed out that drug use was often initiated by the doctor and offered instead of counselling in acute crises. Information on side effects such as addictiveness was reported as largely absent. Both high and low dosage users reported a significant increase in self esteem and ability to cope that was directly related to drug withdrawal and they reported a substantially improved quality of life. Doctors seldom initiated drug reduction strategies and were largely regarded as absent during the withdrawal process. Our informants wanted better care, information and ability to communicate from their doctors, but also stricter prescription strategies and systematic control mechanisms.", 
    "134": "Plasma proteins in hemodialysis patients display a significant increase in deamidated/isomerized Asx (asparagine and aspartic acid) content, a marker of protein fatigue damage. This has been linked to the toxic effects of hyperhomocysteinemia in uremic erythrocytes; however, treatment aimed at abating homocysteine levels did not lead to significant reductions in plasma protein damage. The hypothesis that lack of reduction in protein damage could be due to protein increased intrinsic instability, as result of interference with the uremic milieu rather than to hyperhomocysteinemia, was put forward. The deamidated/isomerized Asx content of normal plasma incubated with several uremic toxins for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 d was measured, identifying a group of toxins that were able to elicit this kind of damage. Uremic toxins were also incubated with purified human albumin, and dose-response experiments with the two most toxic agents in terms of protein damage (guanidine and guanidinopropionic acid) were carried out. The effect of the hemodialysis procedure on protein damage was evaluated. For investigating also the consequences of these alterations, human albumin was treated in vitro to produce an increase in deamidated/isomerized Asx residues, and the effects of albumin deamidation on protein binding were evaluated. Among the uremic toxins that are able to elicit protein damage, guanidine produced a dose-dependent increase in protein damage. No difference was found after a hemodialysis session. Deamidated albumin shows normal binding capacity to warfarin, salicylic acid, or diazepam but reduced binding to homocysteine. In conclusion, uremic toxins, especially guanidine, display an ability to induce significant protein damage, which can in turn have functional consequences.", 
    "135": "Limited randomized, controlled trial data exist on possible differences between atypical antipsychotics in efficacy, overall tolerability, and important indices of health status. The authors compared the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone and olanzapine in the treatment of acutely ill inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.", 
    "136": "In this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-design, flexible-dose trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive ziprasidone (N=136) or olanzapine (N=133). Primary efficacy measures were improvement in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity scale scores; secondary measures were scores on the CGI improvement scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. Tolerability assessments included fasting lipid profiles, fasting glucose and insulin measurements, electrocardiography, and monitoring of vital signs and body weight.",

Both antipsychotics were efficacious in improving symptoms and global illness severity. The two treatment groups did not differ significantly in primary or secondary efficacy measures at endpoint or in by-visit analysis. Both agents were well tolerated. Body weight, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increased with olanzapine but not with ziprasidone; all between-group comparisons of these variables were significant and favored ziprasidone. Olanzapine, but not ziprasidone, was associated with significant increases in fasting insulin level. No patient in either group exhibited a corrected QT interval >/=500 msec.",

Patients at baseline receiving typical antipsychotics (N=10) or risperidone but exhibiting limited response (N=13) were switched to treatment with olanzapine. Patients receiving risperidone and exhibiting a good response (N=14) continued treatment with risperidone. Caudate, putamen, and pallidal volumes were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. The Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale was used to assess clinical signs and symptoms.", 
    "141": "At baseline, basal ganglia volumes in patients treated with typical antipsychotics were greater than in healthy subjects (putamen: 7.0% larger; globus pallidus: 20.7% larger). After the switch to olanzapine, putamen and globus pallidus volumes decreased (9.8% and 10.7%, respectively) and did not differ from those of healthy subjects at the follow-up evaluation. Akathisia was also reduced. In the patients receiving risperidone at baseline, basal ganglia volumes did not differ between those exhibiting good and poor response, and no significant volume changes were observed in subjects with poor risperidone response after the switch to olanzapine treatment.", 
    "142": "Olanzapine reversed putamen and globus pallidus enlargement induced by typical antipsychotics but did not alter volumes in patients previously treated with risperidone. Changes in striatal volumes related to typical and atypical antipsychotics may represent an interactive effect between individual medications and unique patient characteristics.", 
    "143": "Sensory gating deficits found in schizophrenia can be assessed by using a paired auditory stimulus paradigm to measure auditory evoked response. The ratio of the P50 response amplitude of the second or test stimulus to that of the first or conditioning stimulus is expressed as a percentage. Normal subjects generally suppress the second response and typically have ratios of less than 40%. Subjects with schizophrenia and half their first-degree relatives have deficits in sensory gating, with P50 ratios that are generally greater than 50%. Treatment with typical neuroleptics does not reverse this deficit. However, previous studies have shown that treatment with clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic, ameliorates this deficit in clinically responsive patients. This study sought to determine whether other atypical neuroleptics improve P50 ratios.",

Eighty-eight patients were being treated with atypical neuroleptics (clozapine [N=26], olanzapine [N=31], risperidone [N=22], and quetiapine [N=9]). Thirty-four patients were taking typical neuroleptics, and 10 were unmedicated.", 
    "145": "Healthy subjects exhibited P50 suppression that was significantly better than the schizophrenia patients receiving typical neuroleptics (mean=19.8% [SD=21.0%] versus 110.1% [SD=87.9%]). Patients receiving atypical neuroleptics had a mean P50 ratio that fell between these two means (mean=70.4%, SD=53.7%). When patients treated with different atypical neuroleptics were compared, only the clozapine group had mean P50 ratios that were in the normal range.

    "151": "A combination of tiletamine-zolazepam/xylazine (TZ/X) is effective in the chemical immobilization of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus); however, the lengthy duration of immobilization may limit its usefulness. From October to November 2002, 21 captive female deer were assigned randomly to an alpha(2) antagonist treatment to reverse xylazine-induced sedation (seven does per group). All deer were given 220 mg of TZ (4.5+/-0.4 mg/kg) and 110 mg of X (2.2+/-0.2 mg/kg) intramuscularly (IM). Antagonist treatments were either 200 mg of tolazoline (4.0+/-0.4 mg/kg), 11 mg of atipamezole (0.23+/-0.02 mg/kg), or 15 mg of yohimbine (0.30+/-0.02 mg/kg) injected, half intravenously and half subcutaneously, 45 min after the IM TZ/X injection. In addition, 10 other deer (five per group) were immobilized as before and then given tolazoline (200 mg) after 45 min, with either a carrier (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) or carrier (DMSO) plus flumazenil (5 mg) to reverse the zolazepam portion of TZ. Mean times from antagonist injection until a deer raised its head were different for alpha(2) antagonist treatments (P=0.02). Times were longer for yohimbine (62.3+/-42.7 min) than for either atipamezole (24.3+/-17.1 min) or tolazoline (21.3+/-14.3 min). Mean times from antagonist injection until standing were not different (P=0.15) among yohimbine (112.0+/-56.4 min), atipamezole (89.7+/-62.8 min), or tolazoline (52.6+/-37.2 min). A sedation score based on behavioral criteria was assigned to each deer every 30 min for 5 hr. On the basis of sedation scores, tolazoline resulted in a faster and more complete reversal of immobilization. Flumazenil treatment did not affect recovery.", 
    "152": "We describe a 24-year-old Japanese woman with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) whose only early symptom was postural tremor in the right hand at around 18 years of age, leading to a diagnosis of essential tremor at age 21. Although she was treated with arotinolol hydrochloride and clonazepam, she gradually progressed to extrapyramidal and pyramidal signs several years later. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed bilaterally marked hypointensity with a central region of hyperintensity in the globus pallidus, or the so-called \"eye-of-the-tiger\" sign. Six years have passed since the initial appearance of postural tremor, whereas she has not shown choreoathetosis, retinitis pigmentosa, optic atrophy, or seizure. Direct sequencing of the patient's genomic DNA revealed homozygous base substitutions in the pantothenate kinase gene (PANK2): the A764-->G substitution (N245S) due to consanguinity of her parents. Although the heterozygous form of this mutation has already been reported among several families, this is the first report of the homozygous mutation in a patient with atypical-type PKAN. This detailed description of the clinical features of a Japanese patient with PKAN arising from homozygous N245S mutations in PANK2 would be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of PKAN.", 
    "153": "In the present study, we used a repeated restraint stress animal model to observe the changes in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and B cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) in hippocampal neurons of rats, monitored the time course of the expression over 3 weeks post-stress period, and examined the effects of the chronic administration of olanzapine on the time course. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been shown to be neuroprotective in previous in vitro studies. We found: (1) the repeated restraint stress decreases the levels of expression of BDNF and Bcl-2 in hippocampal neurons; (2) the stress-induced decreases spontaneously recover to their pre-stress levels in 3 weeks after the last stress exposure; (3) administration of olanzapine for 1 week returns the expression of Bcl-2 to its pre-stress level, and the administration for 3 weeks causes an excessive expression of BDNF in hippocampal neurons. In the context of the lower levels of BDNF and Bcl-2, and structural brain abnormalities observed in patients with schizophrenia, our findings suggest that BDNF and Bcl-2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and in the therapeutic action of atypical antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "154": "Intracellular ATP supply and ion homeostasis determine neuronal survival and degeneration after ischemic stroke. The present study provides a systematic investigation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures of the influence of experimental ischemia, induced by oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD). The pathways controlling intracellular Na(+) and Ca(2+) concentration ([Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i)) and their inhibition were correlated with delayed cell death or protection. OGD induced a marked decrease in the ATP level and a transient elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) and [Na(+)](i) in cell soma of pyramidal neurons. ATP level, [Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) rapidly recovered after reintroduction of oxygen and glucose. Pharmacological analysis showed that the OGD-induced [Ca(2+)](i) elevation in neuronal cell soma resulted from activation of both N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-glutamate receptors and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers, while the abnormal [Na(+)](i) elevation during OGD was due to Na(+) influx through voltage-dependent Na(+) channels. In hippocampal slices, cellular degeneration occurring 24 h after OGD, selectively affected the pyramidal cell population through apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death. OGD-induced cell loss was mediated by activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, voltage-dependent Na(+) channels, and both plasma membrane and mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers. Thus, we show that neuroprotection induced by blockade of NMDA receptors and plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers is mediated by reduction of Ca(2+) entry into neuronal soma, whereas neuroprotection induced by blockade of AMPA/kainate receptors and mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers might result from reduced Na(+) entry at dendrites level.",

Mounting evidence, reviewed here, indicates that cannabinoids can act to increase food consumption, and cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonists/inverse agonists reduce food intake and suppress operant responding for food rewards. Hence, endocannabinoids provide the first example of a retrograde signalling system, which is strongly implicated in the control of food intake. Benzodiazepine and opioid palatability-dependent appetite are well-established processes supported by several sources of convergent evidence; they provide pharmacological benchmarks against which to evaluate the endocannabinoids. To date, evidence that endocannabinoids specifically modulate palatability as an affective evaluative process is insufficient and not compelling. Endocannabinoids may have important clinical utility in the treatment of human obesity and forms of eating disorders.",

A prior history of overdose was associated with previous mental illness, which in turn was associated with being female, having poor social support, being dissatisfied with relationships, and living alone or in temporary accommodation. While feelings of hopelessness and antisocial behaviour were strongly associated with overdose history, the number of PBS prescription drugs used had a very strong relationship with overdose, particularly benzodiazepines, other opioids, tricyclic antidepressants and tranquillisers.",

    "164": "Emamectin benzoate is the 4'-deoxy-4'-epi-methyl-amino benzoate salt of avermectin B1 (abamectin), which is similar structurally to natural fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis. Emamectin benzoate is being developed as a newer broad-spectrum insecticide for vegetables and has a very low application rate. The mechanism of action involves stimulation of high-affinity GABA receptors and a consequent increase in membrane chloride ion permeability. Animal studies indicate a wide margin of safety because mammalian species are much less sensitive due to lower GABA receptor affinities and relative impermeability of the blood-brain barrier. Notably, the literature has not reported human exposure resulting in toxicity.", 
    "165": "This paper describes a case of acute poisoning with Proclaim insecticide (Syngenta, Taiwan), consisting of 2.15% w/w emamectin benzoate in 2, 6-bis (1, 1-dimethylethyl)-4-methyl-phenol and 1-hexanol. The clinical manifestation was transient gastrointestinal upset with endoscopy-proven gastric erosion and superficial gastritis, mild central nervous system depression, and aspiration pneumonia. No specific antidote exists for emamectin benzoate intoxication; this patient was treated successfully with gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, and empiric antibiotics. Drugs that enhance GABA activity such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines were avoided.", 
    "166": "Ataxia, sedation, amnesia, ethanol and barbiturate potentiation, loss of efficacy (tolerance), development of dependence, and the potential for drug abuse limit the clinical use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) for long-term treatment of epilepsy or anxiety. BZD ligands that are in current use act as full allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels and, on long-term administration, trigger a functional uncoupling between the GABAA and BZD recognition sites. Partial allosteric modulators, which have a low intrinsic activity at the BZD recognition site of the GABAA receptor, might eventually overcome the limitations of full agonists such as diazepam (DZP).", 
    "167": "In the present study, the new low-affinity partial BZD-receptor agonist ELB 138 [former name AWD 131-138; 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-morpholino-imidazolin-2-one] was evaluated in a dog seizure model and in epileptic dogs with spontaneously recurrent seizures.", 
    "168": "ELB 138 was shown to increase potently the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure threshold in dogs. Prolonged oral administration with twice-daily dosing of ELB 138 with either 5 or 40 mg/kg over a 5-week period was not associated with loss of anticonvulsant efficacy in the PTZ dog model. To study whether physical dependence developed during long-term treatment, the BZD antagonist flumazenil was injected after 5 weeks of treatment with ELB 138. Compared with prolonged treatment with DZP, only relatively mild abstinence symptoms were precipitated in dogs treated with ELB 138, particularly at the lower dosage (5 mg/kg, b.i.d.). In a prospective trial in dogs with newly diagnosed epilepsy, ELB 138 markedly reduced seizure frequency and severity without significant difference to standard treatments (phenobarbital or primidone) but was much better tolerated than the standard drugs. In dogs with chronic epilepsy, most dogs exhibited a reduction in seizure frequency and severity during add-on treatment with ELB 138.", 
    "169": "The data demonstrate that the partial BZD receptor agonist ELB 138 exerts significant anticonvulsant efficacy without tolerance in a dog seizure model as well as in epileptic dogs with spontaneously recurrent seizures. These data thus substantiate that partial agonism at the BZD site of GABAA receptors offers advantages versus full agonism and constitutes a valuable approach for treatment of seizures.", 
    "170": "Despite possibility of idiosyncratic reaction development, felbamate (FBM) is recommended in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and partial refractory epilepsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile of interactions between FBM and four conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): clonazepam (CZP), ethosuximide (ESM), phenobarbital (PB), and valproate (VPA), in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice, a model of myoclonic seizures in humans.", 
    "171": "Data obtained from PTZ-evoked seizures were compared by use of two basic procedures, the subthreshold method and isobolographic analysis. Results of the chimney test (evaluating motor coordination) also were elaborated isobolographically. Thus it was possible to determine both median toxic dose (TD50) and protective index (PI) for each drug combination.", 
    "172": "FBM reduced the clonic seizure activity [with an ED50 of 9.7 mg/kg; TD50, 439.1 mg/kg; and PI, 45.3]. FBM at the dose of 10 mg/kg, but not 7.5 mg/kg, significantly reduced PTZ-induced convulsions in mice. In the subthreshold method, FBM (7.5 mg/kg) did not affect the protective activity of conventional AEDs used in the study. However, when applied at 10 mg/kg, it enhanced the protective activity of PB and ESM, but not that of VPA or CZP. The nature of these interactions could not be precisely estimated with this method. The exact profile of drug interactions was determined with the use of isobolography. In terms of seizure inhibition, antagonism was found between FBM and VPA applied at the fixed-dose ratio of 3:1. Synergy was detected between FBM and PB (1:3). Combinations of FBM with VPA (1:3, 1:1), PB (1:1, 3:1), and ESM or CZP (1:3, 1:1, 3:1) led to additive interactions. As regards motor impairment, the combinations of FBM with VPA (1:3) or CZP (1:1, 3:1) were synergistic. Remaining combinations exhibited pure additivity. Pharmacokinetic events may influence FBM/ESM and FBM/CZP interactions, because FBM lowered the brain concentration of ESM and increased that of CZP.", 
    "173": "The profitable benefit index was found only for the combination of FBM with PB (1:3). Conversely, the combinations of FBM with either VPA (1:3) or CZP (1:1, 3:1) do not seem promising for the therapy of refractory myoclonic convulsions. Isobolographic analysis provides more reliable clues to be considered by the clinicians willing to introduce AED combinations for the therapy of epilepsy.", 
    "174": "Somnambulism is an arousal parasomnia consisting of a series of complex behaviours that result in large movements in bed or walking during sleep. It occurs in 2-14% of children and 1.6-2.4% of adults. Occasional benign episodes are managed conservatively. However, recurrent sleepwalking with a risk of injury to self or others mandates immediate treatment with pharmacotherapy while awaiting work-up. The most commonly used medications are benzodiazepines, particularly clonazepam, with tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors also administered. Treatment of underlying causes such as obstructive sleep apnoea, upper airway resistance syndrome, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements, is currently the best approach and usually eliminates somnambulism in children and adults.", 
    "175": "We report a 7-year-old boy with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), with emphasis on the effect of therapy and serial MEG. The equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) of spike discharges accumulated in the bilateral Heschl gyri, predominantly on the right. Although spike discharges on the scalp EEGs disappeared by treatment with clonazepam and sodium valproate, the auditory agnosia did not improve. Therapeutic trials with conventional antiepileptic drugs were unsuccessful. A high-dose corticosteroid was effective, with disappearance of ECDs, appearance of auditory evoked fields (AEF) in the bilateral Heschl gyri on MEG, and improvement of behavioral problems and amelioration of acquired aphasia. The clinical course of this patient suggests that MEG findings are useful not only in making precise diagnosis of LKS but also in assessing and predicting the effects of treatment.",

Seizures of eyelid myoclonia accompanied by absence, precipitated by sunlight, began at the age of 4 years and disappeared at the age of 11 years. Non-convulsive status epilepticus, occurring shortly after awakening, began at the age of 10 years and have occurred intermittently until the age of 18 years. While generalized EEG abnormalities disappeared after initiation of treatment, the patient still had occipital spikes on interictal EEG at the age of 18 years, suggesting occipital hyperexcitability as the basis of photosensitivity. Along with poor drug compliance due to her living apart from her parents, it was difficult to completely suppress non-convulsive status epilepticus, posing serious concern in her adult life.", 
    "177": "Sedation and analgesia are central elements in the care of critically ill, mechanically-ventilated patients. The goal of analgesic therapy is to provide relief from pain and physical discomfort which may lead to poor sleep, agitation, or a stress response. Opioids, such as morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone, are considered first-line agents for treating pain. All of these agents are equally effective at equipotent doses and the choice of an agent depends on both drug and patient characteristics. Sedatives with amnestic properties are desirable to prevent or relieve anxiety and agitation. The benzodiazepines and propofol are the primary sedative agents used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Agents such as clonidine and haloperidol may have a role in the ICU when used concomitantly with sedatives and analgesics. An understanding of the pharmacotherapy of sedation and analgesia in the ICU will help support appropriate usage of these agents and improve patient care.", 
    "178": "The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and caffeine was studied to learn if caffeine consumption varied as a function of benzodiazepine use. Caffeine may antagonize the effects of benzodiazepine and even relatively small amounts can aggravate symptoms associated with anxiety disorders. In addition, caffeine can cause or aggravate insomnia, one of the main reasons cited for use by the subjects in this analysis. Given this, there would seem to be sufficient reason for at least some users of benzodiazepines to consider, with their physicians, avoiding or limiting caffeine consumption. Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed to obtain a nationally representative sample of benzodiazepine users. Subjects included 253 individuals (64% women) whose median age was 54 yr. Approximately 88% of benzodiazepine users reported caffeine consumption in the 24-hr. Dietary Recall. 26% of benzodiazepine users and 23% of nonusers reported consuming greater than 250 mg of caffeine during the 24-hr. reference period. In regression analyses, no significant relationships were found between reported caffeine consumption and benzodiazepine use. This study suggests that users and nonusers of benzodiazepines ingest similar amounts of caffeine even though some users should probably avoid or limit caffeine use.", 
    "179": "Benzodiazepines frequently are administered to patients to induce sedation. Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, characterized by increased talkativeness, emotional release, excitement, and excessive movement, are relatively uncommon and occur in less than 1% of patients. The exact mechanism of paradoxical reactions remains unclear. Most cases are idiosyncratic; however, some evidence suggests that these reactions may occur secondary to a genetic link, history of alcohol abuse, or psychological disturbances. This review evaluates the numerous cases of paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines in adult and pediatric patients that have been reported in the biomedical literature. It also explores the advantages and disadvantages of the various available treatment options.", 
    "180": "Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in combination with perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) has become a widely accepted modality for the selection of patients amenable for acute therapy, if a mismatch between these procedures suggests viable penumbral tissue. However, DWI as well as PWI yields semiquantitative measures limiting the definitions of irreversible damage and of potentially viable penumbral tissue. These limitations of PWI/DWI may be better understood if findings in individual patients are compared with the results from measurements of blood flow, oxygen metabolism, and benzodiazepine receptor binding obtained with positron emission tomography (PET). Comparative studies with PET and MRI were performed in 3 groups of patients: (1) In 12 acute stroke patients, results from DWI (median, 6.5 hours after symptom onset) and 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET (median, 85 minutes between DWI and PET) were compared with infarct extension 24 to 48 hours later on T2-weighted MRI. (2) In 11 acute stroke patients, results from PWI (median, 8 hours after symptom onset) were compared with cerebral blood flow measurements obtained with [15O]H2O PET (interval, 60 minutes between PWI and PET). (3) In 10 patients with acute (n=5) or chronic stroke (n=5), results from PWI/DWI were compared with PET of cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption to detect mismatch or increased oxygen extraction fraction as surrogate markers of penumbra. Results were: (1) from regions with increased DWI intensity, decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and decreased FMZ binding probability curves were computed for eventual infarction, and 95% prediction limits were determined. These limits predicted 83.5% (FMZ), 84.7% (DWI), and 70.9% (ADC) of the final infarct volume. However, the false-positive predictions were much higher for the DWI variables (5.1 and 3.6 cm3 for DWI and ADC versus a median of 0 for FMZ). (2) The comparison of volumes generated by different time to peak (TTP) thresholds (PWI) and hypoperfusion <20 mL/100 g per minute (PET) indicates that a TTP delay of 4 to 6 seconds yields a fair estimate of hypoperfusion. (3) The PWI/DWI mismatch with TTP >4 seconds did not reliably correspond to the penumbra as assessed by PET (oxygen extraction fraction >150%). Only 6 of 10 patients with a mismatch had areas of penumbra. In these cases, the penumbra volume was overestimated by MRI. DWI correlates with FMZ results and, with a few exceptions, yields a good estimate of acute tissue damage and final infarct volume. PWI measures seem to be less reliable; the TTP prolongation of >4 seconds assessed only 83% of the volume of hypoperfusion <20 mL/100 g per minute. The mismatch volume imprecisely depicts increased oxygen extraction fraction, and, despite its clinical role for selection of patients for eventual therapy, it does not to seem to be a reliable correlate of penumbra.", 
    "181": "A quantitative method using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS, ion trap) after matrix supported liquid-liquid extraction is described for the simultaneous determination in whole blood of 33 benzodiazepines including metabolites and benzodiazepine-like substances. The limits of detection (LOD) range from 0.0001 to 0.0126 mg/l. Linearity is satisfactory for all compounds. The extraction recoveries for the benzodiazepines in whole blood are between 60 and 91%, desmethyldiazepam, OH-bromazepam and brotizolam excepted. Selectivity, accuracy and precision are satisfactory for clinical and forensic purposes.", 
    "182": "The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guidelines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.", 
    "183": "Two murine experimental tumor models of different aggressiveness (murine Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma and MH-22A hepatoma) were used to investigate the radiosensitization by porphyrins. Data obtained clearly indicate that hematoporphyrin dimethyl ether, photofrin and hematoporphyrin derivative exert some radiosensitizing properties which are in clear correlation with purity of the compound. Of interest to note, that just aggressive Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma was radiosensitized to gamma-radiation, whereas no signs of radiosensitization were observed in MH-22A hepatoma tumor. Data obtained support the idea, that dicarboxylic porphyrins, being ligands of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (responsible for proliferation and highly expressed in aggressive tumors) might induce several sublethal injuries in the cell which further work in concert with ionizing radiation producing synergistic interaction of two antiproliferative factors.",

The relative expression of CCK-BR mRNA was higher than that of CCK-AR mRNA after incubation with LPS for 0.5, 2, and 6 h. The expression of CCK-R mRNA could be upregulated obviously by LPS. Southern blot analysis of RT-PCR amplified CCK-AR and CCK-BR mRNA products using [gamma-32P]ATP 5'-end-labelled probe showed specific hybridization bands. The specific binding of [3H]CCK-8S to rat PIM membranes was detected in the rats administered with LPS for 48 h, but not in normal rats.
