    "0": "A novel macrocyclic lactone disaccharide anthelmintic agent, Avermectin B1a (AVM) has been found to cause a concentration-dependent increase in the in vitro binding of 3H-diazepam to rat and mouse brain membranes. The increase in binding is manifested as both an increase in the affinity and number of bindings sites for 3H-diazepam. Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrate that AVM can also enhance some of the pharmacological actions of diazepam.", 
    "1": "Studies on the biochemical effects of clinically used psychotropic drugs in brain have shown that they all exert their action by a direct or indirect interference with synaptic transmission. Thus, animal studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that the clinical efficacy of antipsychotic drugs correlates with their inhibitory action on dopamine receptors. In vivo these compounds enhance dopamine turnover in the brain and in vitro they inhibit the dopamine sensitive adenylate cyclase and the binding of dopamine to its receptor at neuronal membranes. Tricyclic antidepressants are drugs which have effects on many transmitter systems. No specific biochemical action has been found which is closely correlated with their clinical potency. However, it appears that a stimulation of the function of the noradrenergic system might have some clinical relevance. Benzodiazepines exert their pharmacological activity in the CNS by interacting with a brain specific receptor. This receptor appears to be part of a larger complex including a GABA receptor and the chloride conductance mechanism associated with the GABA receptor. By binding to their receptor, benzodiazepines appear to enhance the sensitivity of the GABA receptor, thus indirectly potentiating GABA-ergic neurotransmission in the brain.", 
    "2": "The inhibition of serotonin uptake by platelets has been measured in blood from 20 patients on amitriptyline (50--225 mg daily), 14 patients on clomipramine (25--200 mg daily), and in an untreated group of 21 depressed patients. A complete kinetic analysis was carried out in each patient. Using the increase in the kinetic parameter Km as a measure of uptake inhibition, there was high correlation between the daily dose and inhibition within each drug group, clomipramine being about 10 times more potent than amitriptyline. The inhibition did not vary with age, sex, duration of treatment (up to 3 years), or concomitant use of moderate doses of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics or lithium. In the amitriptyline group the inhibition was significantly smaller in smokers than in non-smokers. The kinetic parameter Vmax was essentially unchanged in the amitriptyline group, and was markedly reduced in the clomipramine group, but without any correlation with dose. The mixed competitive-noncompetitive effect of clomipramine confirms previous in vitro findings.", 
    "3": "The effects of electrical foot shock on the activity of the ascending dopaminergic neurons were estimated in the rat by measuring the changes in DOPAC and DA levels in discrete brain areas. DOPAC and DA levels were estimated with a radioenzymatic method in microdiscs of tissues punched out from serial frontal sections of the brain. A marked rise in the ratio of DOPAC/DA levels resulting from an increase of DOPAC and a decrease of DA levels was found in the cerebral frontal cortex at the end of a 20 min stress. The effect was less pronounced in stress of shorter duration from 3 to 10 min and was only related to a reduction of DA levels. Using the DOPAC/DA ratio as an index of the activity of the neurons, the mesocortical dopaminergic neurons were found to be selectively activated under stress since this ratio was increased in the frontal and cingular cortices but not in limbic structures such as the septum, the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens or in the striatum. Finally, pretreatment of the rats with diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) or chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.) prevented the increase in the DOPAC/DA ratio in the frontal cerebral cortex of rats submitted to the 20 min stress.", 
    "4": "The binding of 3H-diazepam to membrane benzodiazepine receptors was examined in four inbred strains of mice. \"Emotional\" or \"anxious\" BALB/cJ mice had significantly lower specific benzodiazepine binding when compared with three other \"non-emotional\" strains. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the lower specific benzodiazepine binding is the result of a lower density of receptors in the \"emotional\" BALB/cJ mice. These results reinforce the contention that a system involving the benzodiazepine receptor may play a role in emotional behavior.", 
    "5": "The results of pen trials indicate that sheep affected by annual ryegrass toxicity can be treated successfully with chlordiazepoxide. In the first experiment, 87% of chlordiazepoxide-treated animals survived a lethal dose of toxic ryegrass. In the second experiment, 90% of chlordiazepoxide treated animals survived compared with a 10% recovery of control animals.", 
    "6": "Pregnant hamsters were treated with different doses of oral and intravenous diazepam during the period of organogenesis. Teratogenic effects of diazepam were observed following oral treatment on days 8 and 10 and following intravenous treatment on day 11 of gestation. Types of malformations included cleft palate, exencephaly, limb anomalies, and hemorrhage. A dose-effect relationship was not observed. Comparison with reported literature seems to indicate that diazepam may be a mild teratogen in some species.", 
    "7": "In a controlled double-blind randomized study Thalamonal and Valium were compared in 498 esophago-gastro-duodenoscopies. Both drugs were injected intravenously immediately before the procedure. Satisfactory sedation which made additional injection of the drug during the endoscopy superfluous could be achieved in 66% of the patients with Thalamonal and in 52% with Valium respectively. The difference between the two preparations is statistically significant (p less than 0,005). In 95 patients catamnestic studies were performed in order to evaluate second episodes of fatigue after the endoscopy. A good effect of the preparation during endoscopy and a lack of second attacks of sedation following discharge was observed only in 23% of the patients after Thalamonal and in 21% of the patients after Valium injection, respectively. Therfore a good premedication was achieved in only one fifth of the patients receiving one of the two drugs.", 
    "8": "It was shown in experiments on rats that the selective blocker of GABA receptors bicuculline (2 mg/kg) does not decrease the activating effect of diazepam as to the reaction of self-stimulation. The GABA-mimetic muscimol (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) had no effect on self-stimulation rate, while in the dose of 2 mg/kg causing behavioral changes produced a powerful decrease in it (by 93.3%). During the combined administration of diazepam and muscimol (1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively) no potentiation of diazepam effect was observed. It is suggested that diazepam-induced facilitation of the reaction of self-stimulation is not due to the alteration in the activity of GABA-ergic processes.", 
    "9": "The effects of i.v. diazepam and droperidol both alone and in combination administered as premedication were studied in 240 patients. Relief of anxiety, sedation, lack of recall, acceptance by both patient and physician and side-effects were evaluated. Overall, the combination of droperidol 2.5 mg with diazepam 5 mg produced better ratings of these variables than could be achieved with either droperidol 10 mg or diazepam 10 mg alone. Larger doses of droperidol with diazepam produce an increased frequency of anxiety; larger doses of diazepam with droperidol may cause over-sedation.", 
    "10": "Thirty-three prospectively studied neonates born to mothers using methadone plus other drugs developed significant thrombocytosis by the second week of life compared to platelet counts performed during the first week. This increase persisted for over 16 weeks, with a further short-lived significant peak at 10 weeks of age. Platelet counts exceeding 1,000,000/mm3 were found in seven infants. Thrombocytosis was not related to withdrawal symptoms or treatment (phenobarbital or paregoric). No thrombocytosis was found in 36 normal control infants up to eight weeks of life. Twenty-eight of the study group infants were evaluated for circulating platelet aggregates. Thirteen patients had a normal aggregate index and a mean platelet count of 468,000/mm3; 15 patients had increased aggregates and mean platelet count of 754,000/mm3. The risk for increased circulating platelet aggregates correlated directly with an increase in platelet count. Thrombocytosis and increased circulating platelet aggregates may be factors in the pathogenesis of the focal infarcts, and subarachnoid and germinal plate hemorrhages, described at autopsy in infants of addicted mothers.", 
    "11": "We performed a within-subject comparison of the kinetics of diazepam given to 7 alcoholic subjects during acute alcohol withdrawal and again after detoxification. The initial rapid exponential decline of plasma diazepam concentrations (t1/2 alpha) was more rapid during (0.21 +/- 0.03 hr) than after withdrawal (0.44 +/- 0.14 hr, p less than 0.05). Terminal t1/2, clearance, and volumes of distribution changed in individual patients, but mean values did not change. Protein binding was less in patients (93.4 +/- 2.4%) than in healthy controls (97.0 +/- 1.0, p less than 0.05). The effects of alcohol withdrawal on diazepam disposition do not explain the high doses of diazepam commonly required to treat the withdrawal.", 
    "12": "There is considerable interspecies and interdrug variability in the effect of sex differences and oral contraceptive (OC) steroids on hepatic drug elimination. Their influence on the disposition of chlordiazepoxide has been studied in 11 healthy young men (29 +/- 5 yr), 11 healthy young women (28 +/- 5 yr), and 7 healthy women receiving OC steroids (27 +/- 2 yr) for more than 6 months. The elimination half-life (t1/2(beta)) was longer (from 14.8 +/- 5.9 hr to 8.9 +/- 2.5 hr) and protein binding less (95.5 +/- 1.4% and 97.0 +/- 1.2%) in women than in men. Weight-normalized plasma clearances of total drug did not differ, but the clearance of unbound drug was significantly less in women (8.7 +/- 5.0 ml/min/kg) than in men (15.6 +/- 5.3 ml/min/kg). Women on OC steroids had a lower plasma binding (from 93.6 +/- 1.5% to 95.5 +/- 1.4%) and a higher volume of distribution (from 0.62 +-/ 0.23 l/kg to 0.40 +/- 0.14 l/kg) than women not on OC steroids. The elimination t1/2 was longer (from 24.3 +/- 12 hr to 14.8 +/- 5.9 hr) and the clearance of unbound drug lower (from 5.7 +/- 3.0 ml/min/kg to 8.7 +/- 5.0 ml/min/kg) in women on OC steroids than in those not using them, but these differences were not statistically significant.", 
    "13": "The effect of oral contraceptives (OCs) on hepatic drug elimination, in this case chlordiazepoxide, was studied in 11 healthy young men, 11 healthy young women, and 7 healthy young women receiving OCs for more than 6 months. Elimination half-life was longer (14.8-8.9 hours) and the protein binding less (95.5 and 97%) in women than in men. When weights were normalized, plasma clearances of total drug did not differ, but clearance of unbound drug was significantly less in women (8.7 ml/min/kg) than in men (15.6 ml/min/kg). Women taking OCs had a lower plasma binding (from 93.6-95.5%) and a higher volume of distribution (from .62-4 1/kg) than women not taking OCs. Elimination half-life was longer (from 23.4-14.8 hours) and clearance of unbound drug lower (from 5.7-8.7 ml/min/kg) in women on OCs than in those not using them, but these differences were not statistically significant.", 
    "14": "Severe alcohol withdrawal developed in an abstinent chronic alcoholic man. Massive doses of benzodiazepines (2,335 mg of diazepam intravenously, 21,225 mg of oxazepam orally) achieved only marginal control of delirium and agitation. Analysis of multiple blood samples drawn during and after the withdrawal episode indicated, as expected, very high concentrations of diazepam and metabolites and of oxazepam. There was no evidence of an abnormal pharmacokinetic profile. Benzodiazepine resistance in withdrawing alcoholics probably reflects a receptor-site phenomenon rather than an abnormal drug disposition.", 
    "15": "1. Twenty-four anxious inpatients were treated with diazepam, amylobarbitone sodium and placebo in flexible dosage for 1 week. They each received all three treatments according to a fully-balanced design, using double-blind procedures. 2. The clinical and the psychological effects of the drugs were assessed by the comprehensive battery of psychiatrist's ratings, subjective and psychological tests before treatment and at the end of each week of treatment. The tests included self-rating of anxiolytic and hypnotic effects, reaction-time, card sorting, coding and cancellation tasks, arithmetic and tappin. 3. Diazepam improved significantly subjective anxiety and insomnia, while amylobarbitone improved only the self-rated quality of sleep. Occasion effects were absent on clinical measures, indicating that the patients did not respond to non-specific temporal factors. Performance on motor tasks improved over time because of the expected practice effect, but an impairment relative to placebo was detected on two motor tests after the barbiturate and on four other tests with a cognitive component after the benzodiazepine.", 
    "16": "We describe a method for simultaneous quantitation of diazepam and its metabolites, N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam, by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection at 254 nm. After extraction with chloroform at pH 11.0, the organic extract is evaporated, and the residue is reconstituted in a small volume of mobile-phase and chromatographed. Concentrations as low as 12 to 20 microgram/L can be detected after extraction of only 250 microL of plasma. The maximum within-day and day-to-day coefficients of variation for each compound at concentrations of 50, 250, and 1000 microgram/L are 8.0 and 10.3%, respectively. Of 14 commonly used anticonvulsant, sedative, and psychotherapeutic drugs, only carbamazepine and lorazepam may interfere with analysis for oxazepam or N-desmethyldiazepam, or both. Total chromatography time for a single sample is less than 10 min. Applicability of the method to diazepam disposition studies in children is illustrated.", 
    "17": "Effect of diazepam on the somatosensory evoked responses (SER) following tooth pulp stimulation was investigated in Wistar albino rats. The SERs were recorded from the contralateral surface of the skull with a silver ball electrode and 200 responses were averaged with a medical computer. Generally, SERs were found to be composed of a sequence of four components named P1 (first positive wave), N1 (first negative wave), P2 (second positive wave), and N2 (second negative wave) in a 100 msec analysis time. Diazepam enhanced only the amplitude of the P1 component to about 500% of the control, while it suppressed other N1, P2, and N2 components to about 30, 40, and 20% of the control, respectively. The maximum suppressed effect appeared about 30 min after the diazepam injection and the effect was maintained for about 150 min. One possible explanation for the present result is that the activities of the synapses mostly in cortical layter IV evoked by tooth pulp stimulation may be enhanced but the activities of the cortical cells may be suppressed by diazepam injection.", 
    "18": "A model for the assessment of recovery to street fitness from two commonly used techniques for intravenous sedation is described. Well-known psychometric research methods and simple paper-and-pencil tests that could be given by interested clinicians were used. The speed of recovery from diazepam-methohexital, and diazepam-methohexital and fentanyl (with naloxine reversal), did not differ significantly. Psychomotor skills were recovered before both perceptual and cognitive functions. Two simple paper-and-pencil tests easily identified perceptual and cognitive deficits at least three hours postoperatively.", 
    "19": "The Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reveals striking bioelectrical and clinical features which provide indirect confirmation of actions in cortical, subcortical and brainstem neuronal systems determining the type, the stage and the fatal limits of the course. The periodic paroxysmal complex waves in EEG, the signs of motor, vigilance and respiratory impairment and the site of lesions are delineated in a case of cortico-striato-cerebellar type and compared with other cases in literature. Other forms of electroencephalographic periodicity in different clinical and experimental conditions are discussed. The period dynamics are referred to the course of disease and investigated under the influence of anticonvulsive drugs.", 
    "20": "Micro-injections of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the dorsal raphe nucleus produced a behavioural profile in the social interaction test of anxiety similar to that seen in rats treated chronically with benzodiazepines. Neurotoxin injections into the median raph\u00e9 nucleus did not produce a profile significantly different from that of the controls. In the control rats and in the rats with lesions of the median raph\u00e9 nucleus, ACTH1-24 (corticotrophin) significantly reduced active social interactions, whereas it was without effect on the rats with lesions of the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus. In the home-cage intruder test, the median raph\u00e9-lesioned rats submitted less to the intruder and stood and jumped on him more often than did the controls. The dorsal raph\u00e9-lesioned rats showed significantly fewer interactions of all kinds, compared with control rats when an intruder was placed in their home cages.", 
    "21": "During 5 days after intraperitoneal injection of 14C-phenazepam into albino rats, about 77% of the total radioactivity was excreted with urine and feces in both intact animals and in those premedicated with phenazepam for 15 days. The excretory processes are described by the first order equations. The rates of phenazepam total excretion are identical in single and repeated injections. At the same time, phenazepam injected into the animals at a single dose is predominantly excreted with urine, while in multiple administration it is excreted with feces. Excretion of phenazepam with urine acquires the biexponential features, provided it is injected in multiple doses.", 
    "22": "The plasma concentrations of medazepam and its metabolites, diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, were determined in volunteer subjects following the oral administration of medazepam 10 mg. The results indicated that medazepam was absorbed rapidly, that low concentrations of metabolites were present during the 1st h, and that the build-up in the circulation of the major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, was prolonged and variable. As many of the clinical effects and possible adverse reactions of medazepam appear to be associated with the presence of this major metabolite, the metabolic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug should be considered when using medazepam as an anxiolytic before dentistry or surgery.", 
    "23": "In isolated segments of the rat tail artery, the influence of narcotic analgesics, their antagonists, droperidol, diazepam, and flunitrazepam on the vascular smooth muscle was investigated. The wall of this vessel consists of about 75 per cent smooth muscle fibres. For all agents studied, pressure-diameter relations were determined before and after a virtually maximum constriction which was induced with noradrenaline. The results were compared with those obtained under control conditions, i.e. prior to the addition of the drugs to the bath solution. Tested in pure Tyrode's solution, none of the agents produced a noticeable constriction or relaxation. Among the analgesics and their antagonists, morphine was the most potent in inhibiting the noradrenaline-induced constriction of the vessel (mean increase in diameter 15%). Pentazocine and levallorphan were less effective (mean increase 8%), and the administration of pethidine and naloxone was followed by even less relaxation, resulting in mean diameter increases of 4%. Piritramide and fentanyl did not show any effect. Depending on the pressure level, droperidol caused the diameter to increase 2 to 10%. Flunitrazepam brought about a marked relaxation (mean increase in diameter 15%), diazepam, however, did not influence the vessel segments. The results obtained show that the haemodynamic effects of the drugs used in this study, in particular those on the peripheral resistance, may, at least partially, be due to their direct influences on the vascular smooth muscle. The real pharmacologic mechanisms by which these effects are initiated, in most cases still remain to be investigated.", 
    "24": "An investigation of the structural requirements for CNS activity of the title compounds was undertaken. A synthesis of the precursor dihydro-10H-thieno[3,4-b][1,5]benzodiazepin-10-ones was achieved and three routes for their conversion to the title compounds were developed. The compounds were tested for neuroleptic activity by means of the blockade or d-amphetamine lethality in aggregated mice and/or effects on locomotor activity in rats. Antidepressant activity was examined using inhibition of tetrabenazine-induced depression in mice. Most of the compounds were found to be potent neuroleptic agents with several exhibiting additional antidepressant activity.", 
    "25": "The benzodiazepine receptor in the cortex of 1 spontaneously epileptic baboon exhibited an increased rate of thermal inactivation at 65 degrees C when compared with those from 3 other baboons. In other respects (receptor concentration, affinities for flunitrazepam and diazepam, and response to changing pH), the benzodiazepine receptor from this animal was very similar to the receptors in the cortex of 3 other baboons. The 3H-QNB (muscarinic) and 3H-naloxone (opiate) binding sites in the brain of all 4 baboons appeared very similar with respect to all parameters studied (thermal stability, concentration, regional distribution, and affinities for respective ligands). An endogenous factor stabilizing the benzodiazepine receptor could be lacking in the spontaneously epileptic baboon.", 
    "26": "Presents extensive reports of detoxification and habit loosing trials in 9 male heroine addicts, 19-26 yr. The therapeutic programs were centered on gabergic drugs, low doses tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and acupuncture (main points: 8 GB; nasal GB; 1 GB; 3 L; 4 LI; 36 S; 7 H; auricular Shen men) and were continued weekly at the Mental Health Outpatients Service, after discharge from the hospital.", 
    "27": "2 Ss, personally checked, abstinent 6 months after their discharge; 4 Ss heard as abstinent and 3 Ss relapsed. Technique, course and times of the therapeutic program seem to be one of the key factors for success.", 
    "28": "In these experiments, the GABA control upon dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons has been investigated using circling behavior in the rat. Chronically cannulated rats were given D-amphetamine (2 mg/kg i.p.) 45 min before unilateral microinjection (0.2 microliter/2 min) into the substantia nigra (SN) of GABA, muscimol, chlordiazepoxide (CDP) or bicuculline. Circling behavior was continuously recorded for 165 min using an automated rotometer. (1) Non-microinjected control rats exhibit a 'spontaneous' circling behavior after amphetamine. (2) When applied to the SN contralateral to the preferential side of the 'spontaneous' rotations, saline enhances contraversive circling; GABA (5 X 10(-5)M), CDP (5 X 10(-5)M) and muscimol (5 x 10(-7)M, 5 X 10(-8)M) counteract this effect and induce (except CDP) light ipsiversive rotations; GABA (10(-2)M) and muscimol (5 x 10(-5)M) further enhance contraversive turning. (3) When applied to the SN ipsilateral to the preferential side of the 'spontaneous' rotations, saline has no marked effect on the ipsiversive circling behavior but induces weak contraversive turning; GABA (5 X 10(-5)M), CDP (5 X 10(-5)M) and muscimol (5 x 10(-8)M) enhance the ipsiversive rotations; GABA (10(-2)M) and muscimol (5 x 10(-5)M) transiently decrease the ipsiversive circling; bicuculline (5 x 10(-5)M) induces a vigorous contraversive turning associated with a transient inhibition of the ipsiversive rotations. These results suggest that the activity of the nigral neurons is presumably stimulated by the microinjection itself, by bicuculline and, to a lesser extent, by high concentrations of GABA and muscimol, and inhibited by low concentrations of GABA, muscimol and CDP. These findings could further support the hypotheses of a GABAergic inhibitory control upon DA nigrostriatal pathways and of a GABA-like activity of CDP.", 
    "29": "A survey is presented of the variations of neuroleptanalgesia. Modification of the injection technique, the hypnotic, the analgesic or the neuroleptic partial effect of the drug combinations produces four variations. The principles of the classical type of neuroleptanalgesia, namely the ability to selectively influence the single components of anaesthesia and the predominant use of a strong analgesic must remain unaltered in the definition of a variant. The use of clear nomenclature is used in an attempt to overcome the confusion which still exists in this field.", 
    "30": "Murine spinal cord neurons grown in dissociated cell culture were used to study the effects of barbiturate (phenobarbital, mephobarbital) and benzodiazepine (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide( anticonvulsants on amino acid responses. Both types of anticonvulsant augmented GABA-mediated postsynaptic inhibition without augmenting beta-alanine or glycine-mediated postsynaptic inhibition. Barbiturates, but not benzodiazepines, antagonized glutamate-mediated postsynaptic excitation. Augmentation of GABA-mediated inhibition by the anticonvulsants should contribute to their anticonvulsant action; antagonism of glutamate-mediated excitation by barbiturates should also contribute to their anticonvulsant action and could be at least in part responsible for their sedative actions.", 
    "31": "The ability of pentobarbital, diazepam, and chlorpromazine to attenuate the rate-decreasing effects of a high dose (10 or 30 mg/kg) of meperidine was tested in pigeons responding under a multiple fixed-ratio, fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. Pentobarbital (10 mg/kg) attenuated the meperidine-induced rate decreases, whereas diazepam (0.3--3 mg/kg) or chlorpromazine (3--30 mg/kg) did not reliably attenuate the response rate decreases. The combination of 10 mg/kg of pentobarbital and meperidine resulted in a marked disruption of the pattern of responding in the fixed-interval component of the multiple schedule. Pentobarbital (1, 3, 10, and 17.5 mg/kg) was also tested in combination with rate-decreasing doses of normeperidine (17.5 mg/kg), anileridine (10 mg/kg), alphaprodine (10 mg/kg), and fentanyl (0.3 mg/kg). Pentobarbital reliably attenuated the rate-decreasing effects of normeperidine, anileridine, and alphaprodine, but not the rate decreases induced by fentanyl.", 
    "32": "Psychiatric patients (N = 26) were treated chronically (from 1 week to 12 years) with nitrazepam, because of insomnia. The patients gave their subjective estimations of the effects and side effects of nitrazepam. The concentrations of nitrazepam in the plasma were measured by 63Ni-EC-gas-liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetics of nitrazepam were compared between the psychiatric patients and healthy volunteers (N = 11). The steady-state concentrations and the half-life of nitrazepam in the psychiatric patients were comparable to those of the healthy volunteers. The subjective hypnotic effect of nitrazepam was mostly good or satisfactory and remained unchanged during long-term treatment. Only a few, mild side effects were reported. Nitrazepam does not seem to cause enzyme induction with lowered plasma levels and may therefore be of special value in the treatment of chronic insomnia.", 
    "33": "The purpose of this research was to study the isolated effects of and interactions between undernutrition and emotional reactivity upon maze performance in rats. This work compares the effects of chlordiazepoxide on learning performance in two groups of adult rats: one undernourished early in life and then rehabilitated, and the other normally nourished. Chlordiazepoxide was used at 5 mg/kg body weight administered i.p. 30 min before each test. The response was evaluated in a Hebb-Williams maze. Water was used as reinforcement. Chlordiazepoxide improved performance in the early undernourished group 197 +/- 55.9 errors to 149 +/- 33.6 (mean +/- SD). Chlordiazepoxide impaired performance of the normal group from 107 +/- 22.7 errors to 197 +/- 42.2 errors. Analysis of variance gave an F = 6.64, which is significant (P less than 0.01). This supports the hypothesis that the high emotional level of previously undernourished subjects acts negatively upon problem-solving performance.", 
    "34": "A radioreceptor method is described for the estimation of serum concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites. The technique is simple, rapid and suitable for batch analysis. Ad advantage of the technique is that it gives a measure of the total pharmacological activity of the serum samples towards the benzodiazepine receptor and is thus directly applicable to benzodiazepines other than diazepam. The results obtained by the radioreceptor assay and by a GLC technique are correlated.", 
    "35": "A preliminary study on 40 female patients who had undergone colposuspension surgery was carried out using four drugs in an attempt to reduce the time taken to void spontaneously following surgery and to define the cause of delay. Oral diazepam given as night sedation, was found to be the most effective drug.", 
    "36": "Effects of diazepam were examined on the whine reaction elicited by LH stimulation and on unit activities in the LH and Abm in cats. The spontaneous firing frequency of Abm neurons was 5 to 30 spikes/sec and in all 6 neurons isolated the firing frequency increased by non-nociceptive and/or clap-stimulation. Diazepam decreased the spontaneous firing frequency of all Abm neurons isolated and the increased firing frequency elicited by non-nociceptive and/or clap-stimulation was also depressed by diazepam. The spontaneous firing frequency of neurons in the LH was 4 to 5 spikes/sec and all 6 neurons isolated firing frequency increased by non-nociceptive stimulation. Only one of 6 neurons, however, was activated by clap-stimulation. Diazepam decreased the spontaneous firing frequency of all LH neurons. Out of 6 neurons responsive to non-nociceptive stimulation, 3 were also depressed by diazepam. The other neurons were not affected by diazepam. These results suggest that depressed action of diazepam on the whine reaction elicited by the LH stimulation may be related to the decrease of firing in the Abm and/or the LH by diazepam.", 
    "37": "Effects of four benzodiazepine derivatives on gamma-activity were examined in the anesthetized rat. Diazepam and 5-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-7-nitro-1, 3-dihydro-2H-1, 4-benzodiazepin-2-one(ID-690) in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg (i.p.) showed depressant effects on gamma-activity. The depressant effects of 5.0 mg/kg (i.p.) lasted for more than 60 min. Nitrazepam had a slightly weaker effect than the above two drugs and the effect was evident after an administration of 5.0 mg/kg; the effect of 10 mg/kg(i.p.) lasted for more than 90 min. The effect of clonazepam was much weaker than effects of the other three drugs. A dose of 20 mg/kg(i.p.) was required to produce an obvious depressant action, and the effect appeared after a longer latency of about 20 min. ID 690 (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) depressed the augmented response of the gamma-activity in response to pinna stimulation. The effect of diazepam on the augmented responses was observed with the same dose. In contrast, much higher doses of nitrazepam and clonazepam were required to induce an obvious depressant effect on the augmented gamma-activity. It is suggested that the difference in potency in depressing gamma-activity of these derivatives is one of the factors characterizing their pharmacological properties.", 
    "38": "Six young adult subjects were awakened five to eight times per night from stage 2 sleep in a standardized manner for a series of at least 11 non-consecutive nights. After adaptation to the procedure, subjects received placebo, pentobarbital, or flurazepam on two random nights and caffeine on one night. The latency of the return to sleep after each awakening was measured. On placebo nights a characteristic U-shaped curve of latency as a function of time of night was found. Latencies were long shortly after sleep onset but decreased rapidly to about 50 sec before beginning an approximately linear logarithmic increase throughout the rest of the night. The drugs characteristically altered this time course. Pentobarbital decreased latencies in the first half of the night. Flurazepam decreased latencies throughout the night. Caffeine increased latencies during the first half of the night.", 
    "39": "1 The effects of diazepam (5 mg) and hyoscine hydrobromide (0.3 mg) were assessed in two memory tasks: short-term retention of digit strings and the free recall of items from categorizable lists. 2 One hundred and two healthy subjects were tested in an independent-groups design. Subjects were assigned randomly to either placebo, diazepam or hyoscine groups. Treatments were administered orally under double-blind conditions. 3 The short-term retention of digits was impaired to an equivalent degree and locus for both drugs (P less than 0.05). This effect was ascribed to the action on primary memory. 4 The drugs produced no significant effects on the recall of categorizable lists either in terms of the number of words recalled or the cohesiveness of categorical recall. 5 These results demonstrate that drugs of different pharmacological actions produce isomorphic psychological deficits in memory and that 'anti-memory' effects on one task should not be extrapolated to all aspects of memory.", 
    "40": "In a group of 22 epileptic patients under treatment with clonazepam (CNP) it has been evaluated the serum levels of CNP in a seried way for a period of several months, by a radio-immunological technique. Except for one patient, all the others were under politherapy. On the basis of the data obtained from this study we tried to evaluate the pharmachological action of CNP. Even if we found a good clinical efficacy of CNP with therapeutic ranges (from 19,57 +/- 10,98 ng/ml up to 60,16 +/- 31,18 ng/ml) we didn't find any correlation between the oral dose and serum level, taking into account also other parameters such as sex, pound and age. The Authors discuss the possible factors which may be thought involved in this lacking correlation.", 
    "41": "Pretreatment for 4 days with 10 mg/kg coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) or 1 day with 85U alpha-tocopherol (Vit E) produced equal reduction in the acute toxicity of 0.5 mg/kg anthramycin (ANTH). Twenty-seven days after ANTH, 40 percent of control mice survived, those pretreated with CoQ or Vit E displayed 73 and 80 percent survival. A 17.5 mg/kg dose of adriamycin (ADR) produced a percent survival-time curve resembling that produced by 0.5 mg/kg ANTH. At this dose of ADR, however, the protection afforded by CoQ and Vit E was minimal and not statistically significant (p less than 0.05). CoQ or Vit E may be of value at reducing the toxicity of anticancer agents other than the anthracyclines.", 
    "42": "The interaction between chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and forebrain noradrenaline (NA) was investigated in rats with bilateral radiofrequency lesions of the noradrenergic dorsal tegmental bundle (DTB). Forebrain NA was reduced to 35% of control by the DTB lesions; hypothalamic NA and dopamine were unchanged. Rats were trained on a straight alley runway task for food reward. During extinction of the runway task, CDP significantly increased extinction responding in sham lesion animals but not in DTB lesion animals. Thus, CDP was ineffective in increasing resistance to extinction responding in the runway task in animals with significant depletion of forebrain NA.", 
    "43": "A word recognition task was designed to determine the stage in memory affected by a single 10-mg intravenous injection of diazepam and the duration of the effect. Injection in three experimental subjects produced an anterograde amnesia for the 14 to 24-minute period immediately after injection. Memory loss resulted from impaired storage, the stage during which information is entered into memory. Retention and retrieval stages of memory were unaffected. This temporary amnesia may result from increased inhibition in the hippocampal system produced by diazepam, which shares many properties with the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid.", 
    "44": "Clobazam is a new 1,5 benzodiazepine which differs from the 1,4 benzodiazepines such as diazepam, in that it displays a wide separation of its tranquillising or anxiolytic effects from impairment of cortical arousal and psychomotor performance. Its potential advantages as a premedicant for day-case or outpatient surgery were evaluated in a placebo-controlled double-blind study in female patients undergoing minor day surgery. Anxiety reduction was evaluated clinically and by means of plasma cortisol estimations. The clinical evaluation, using an established portocol, did not differentiate either active drug from placebo or between the active drugs; the cortisol results permitted opposing conclusions depending on the statistical approach used. Potential fallacies inherent in the methodology current used for evaluating premedicant drugs are discussed.", 
    "45": "In a retrospective study 103 patients with acute acoustic trauma (AAT) were investigated. The control group (53 patients) was treated with Dextran 40 (10% solution), neurotrop vitamins and Betahistin. Bencyclan was administered additionally in the test group (50 patients). Statistical analysis of the audiometric data showed the following results: 1. Mean hearing levels of the test group showed better improvement of threshold shifts, if the therapy started within 2 days or after more than 10 days after the AAT. 2. Regression-and correlation coefficients, however, in a regression analysis of absolute hearing gains and hearing losses before therapy, did not indicate a substantial effect of Bencyclan. 3. Neither did statistical tests with relative hearing gains show any significant differences between test-and control groups. Consequently Bencyclan is not likely to have a positive effect in AAT, if it is administered in the above mentioned way.", 
    "46": "A crossover comparative study of valproate sodium and clonazepam in the treatment of 32 adult epileptic patients receiving multiple drug therapy is described. Serum concentrations of other anticonvulsant drugs were unchanged by the addition of clonazepam. However, patients receiving high doses of other anticonvulsant drugs had lower serum concentrations of clonazepam (p less than .01). With valproate sodium, phenobarbital concentrations increased (P less than .05) in patients receiving phenobarbital but not significantly in patients receiving primidone. Phenytoin concentrations were reduced (P less than .05) during treatment with valproate sodium. Both drugs significantly reduced the frequency of minor seizures, with valproate sodium having the greater effect. However, it is important to monitor serum concentrations of other anticonvulsant drugs during treatment with valproate sodium since changes in these may influence seizure control or cause side effects.", 
    "47": "In the brains of normal and reserpinized rats both diazepam and amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA) decreased the 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) accumulation induced by the decarboxylase inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015). In reserpinized animals, the action of diazepam was antagonized by picrotoxin and bicuculline in doses which did not themselves influence the NSD 1015-induced rise in 5HTP. In conclusion, diazepam probably depresses 5HT synthesis via GABAergic mechanisms and this effect is not dependent on a functionally intact monoaminergic synaptic transmission.", 
    "48": "Tracings were made on three patients using a modified pantographic device. The tracings were made on glass flags with wax, etched, and superimposed. The effects of body position and modification were investigated. From this research project the following can be concluded: 1. A precise method has been developed which permits superimposition of pantographic tracings for analysis. 2. There is a significant difference in reproducibility between medicated and nonmedicated subjects. 3. The percentage coincidence of border tracings increases significantly when the patient is pantographed while under the influence of medication (Valium). 4. The angulation of the body does not appear to be significant for reproducing border tracings. 5. There appears to be no significant difference in the reproducibility of the border tracings relative to time (1, 1 1/2, 2, and 2 1/2 hours) after medication. 6. The lateral side shift of the jaw cannot always be reproduced accurately. 7. The neuromusculature appears to be the overriding factor governing border movements.", 
    "49": "The binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, of 3H-dihydroalprenolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, and of 3H-flunitrazepam, a ligand which labels benzodiazepine receptors, was examined in several regions of control and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) brains. 3H-Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding appeared to increase in the inferior olivory nucleus, anterior and posterior cerebellar vermi but was unaltered in the dentate nucleus and cerebellar hemisphere of FA brain. The binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol seemed to increase in the inferior olivary nucleus yet was not different from controls in the dentate nucleus, cerebellar hemisphere, anterior and posterior cerebellar vermi of FA brains. 3H-Flunitrazepam binding was slightly lowered in the inferior olivary and dentate nuclei but was unchanged in the other FA brain regions examined. The present study suggests possible trends in neurotransmitter receptor alterations in post-mortem brain tissue of FA patients.", 
    "50": "Sympathetic overactivity in tetanus is a common event and may be difficult to control. This report demonstrates the efficacy of morphine in this clinical situation and also discusses the sympathetic effects of 3 muscle relaxants, pancuronium, d-tubocurarine and alcuronium.", 
    "51": "The effects of morphine, diazepam and chlorpromazine were examined on the discrimination of electric shock in squirrel monkeys. Two discrete responses measured discrimination of the presence or absence of shock at two different intensities, either at 0.35 mA or at an intensity determined to be close to each monkey's threshold (0.05 or 0.15 mA). The percentage of responses which were correct in the presence and the absence of shock were determined separately. Time to respond to the presence or the absence of shock was also determined. Morphine decreased the percentage of correct responses at both the lower (0.05--0.15 mA) and the higher (0.35 mA) shock intensities, although effects at the higher intensity were very slight. Morphine had little effect on correct responses in the absence of shock. In contrast, diazepam decreased the percentage of correct responses in the absence of shock without affecting correct responses in the presence of shock, and chlorpromazine decreased the percentage of correct responses both in the presence and absence of shock. All three drugs increased time to respond both to the presence of shock and to the absence of shock with chlorpromazine producing the largest increase. Only morphine increased time to respond in the absence of shock more than in the presence of shock.", 
    "52": "The study of 210 cases of voluntary intoxications by benzodiazepines alone, out of a total of 2080 intoxicated patients admitted at the Hospital of Tours, shows that when no other drugs is associated the prognosis is good, both for children and for adults. The association with ethanol does not change the prognosis. The clinical symptoms alone cannot prove the nature of the gravity of the intoxications. After having analysed the drugs present in the gastric juice, and after having checked that only benzodiazepines are implied, the patient can usually be taken care of on a non specialized ward.", 
    "53": "Brain specific benzodiazepine receptors appear to mediate the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines. A neuronal localization for these receptors is suggested by the parallel decrease in the number of benzodiazepine receptors and cerebellar Purkinje cells in \"nervous\" mutant mice. Electrophysiological results are compatible with an action of benzodiazepines on neuronally localized, physiological receptors. Biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral experiments highlight the possible importance of frontal cortex in mediating the anxiolytic properties of the benzodiazepines. Triazolenetetrazoles act upon benzodiazepine receptors, increase punished responding and protect against penetylenetetrazole-induced convulsions, but do not produce the side effects associated with benzodiazepines or affect classical neurotransmitter systems. The structural similarities between triazolopyridazines, purines and the indole portion of certain peptides may provide insights into the nature of the endogenous ligand.", 
    "54": "Several new lines of evidence suggest the existence of two or more distinct types of benzodiazepine receptors, in contrast to earlier results suggesting the presence of only one class of receptors. Appropriate thermoinactivation experiments indicate two receptors with different thermostabilities. Several triazolopyridazines, with some of the pharmacological properties of anxiolytics have recently been shown to displace 3H-diazepam and 3H-flunitrazepam with Ki values in the 6 to 100 nanomolar range. These new substances are active in conflict tests in rats and monkeys and prevent metrazol induced seizures in vivo, but strikingly lack the ataxia and sedative properties of the benzodiazepines. Hill analyses of dose-response curves for some of these substances yields Hill coefficients in the range of 0.4--0.6, suggesting that these compounds may be able to discriminate between several types of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "55": "The recent demonstration of benzodiazepine receptors in the mammalian CNS has provided new information on the mechanism of action of this important class of drugs. In addition, the presence of these receptors has prompted studies on their physiological significance, including attempts at isolating an endogenous ligand. The isolation of a number of substances from bovine brain that competitively inhibit (3H)-diazepam binding to synaptosomal membrane suggests the presence of an endogenous ligand. Two of these substances have been identified as the purines inosine and hypoxanthine. Pharmacological studies of these purines suggest that they may have diazepam-like effect in vivo. The possibility that the brain may contain its own benzodiazepine-like compound is currently being studied.", 
    "56": "Recent studies on agents which alter benzodiazepine binding site sensitivity in brain are described. GABAergic agonists enhance and antagonists inhibit binding to the brain specific benzodiazepine binding site, and the binding can be correlated with effects on neuronal cell firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Anions such as chloride, iodide and nitrite also enhance (3H)diazepam binding and this enhancement is consistent with their role in postsynaptic inhibition. Pretreatment of animals with the anticonvulsant, diphenylhydantoin, enhances both diazepam binding and the electrophysiological response to diazepam suggesting one possible locus for the anticonvulsant action of diphenylhydantoin in brain. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a GABA/Cl- ionophore/BZ binding complex in brain. Preliminary results on the purification of the BZ component of this complex and fluorescent probes for its study are described.", 
    "57": "Using radioreceptor assay techniques to measure the kinetics of GABA and diazepam receptors, a relationship between GABA and benzodiazepine receptors has been firmly established in membranes of brain and neuroblastoma NB2a clonal cell lines. Occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors uncovers a new population of GABA receptors (GABA2 receptors) endowed with high affinity for GABA. Moreover, stimulation of GABA receptors increases the affinity of 1,4-benzodiazepine receptors for 1,4-benzodiazepines. This reciprocal interaction appears to be mediated by an endogenous regulatory protein (for details on this protein see [14 and 29]) which allosterically regulates GABA2 receptors while it competitively interacts with benzodiazepines for their specific binding sites. The rank order of potency of the various 1,4-benzodiazepines to block the action of this protein inhibitor on GABA receptors is related to their capacity to displace 3H-diazepam binding. These data suggest that the interaction between the 1,4-benzodiazepine receptors and the endogenous protein modulator of GABA2 receptors might play a role in the pharmacological action of the 1,4-benzodiazepines."
