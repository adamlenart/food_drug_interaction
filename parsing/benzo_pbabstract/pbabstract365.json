    "0": "The case of a woman of 27 affected by the Prader-Willi syndrome who underwent general anaesthesia for dental surgery is reported. The patient presented severe mental retardation, small stature, moderate muscular hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Premedication consisted of diazepam and atropine; anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with propofol, fentanyl and N2O; muscle paralysis was obtained with atracurium. A small glottis was observed at laryngoscopy so that a 6 mm cuffed tube was inserted. Surgery lasted 75 minutes; the patient recovered promptly a few minutes following the end of propofol infusion; no postoperative complication was recorded. As hypoglycemia can occur during and after surgery in the Prader-Willi syndrome, plasma samples for glucose, NEFA, insulin, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH) were collected prior to the induction of anaesthesia (A), 20 minutes after starting surgery (B), at the end of surgery (C), and 3 hours later (D). In spite of the infusion of glucose, hyperglycemia was observed just in C and D samples (A:77; B:88; C:245; D:279 mg/dl). Stable NEFA values, within the normal range, were observed (A:77; B:88; C:245; D:279 mg/dl) suggesting poor or absent lipolysis. Insulin decreased progressively during surgery (A:10.5; B:8.8; C:5.4; D:7.0 mU/L). Cortisol peaked in B (A:9.5; B:20.9; C:13.4; D:4.8 micrograms/dl), suggesting normal hypothalamic reactivity to the surgical stimulus. Finally very low GH levels were observed (A:0.04; B:0.07; C:0.06; D:0.09 ng/ml) suggesting GH deficiency, which had possibly affected the size of patient's glottis. Our data support the hypothesis that hypoglycemia in the Prader-Willi syndrome originates from inadequate lipolysis during starvation.",

Chromatographic measurement in a thin layer of the adsorbent was carried out on L 5/40 M plates in the following solvent systems: tholuene-acetone-25% ammonium hydroxide (50:50:1); ethyl acetate-methanol-25% ammonium hydroxide (17:2:1); chloroform-methanol (9:1); and chloroform-acetone (9:1). Analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography was carried out by means of a Milichrome-4 chromatographer with a UV detector on the column packed with Separone C18 (5 mcm) using a mobile phase acetonitrile-0.05 M disubstituted ammonium phosphate (55:45).", 
    "2": "1. Intravenous administration of the putative M1 muscarinic agonist McN-A-343 to conscious rats evokes an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) which can be blocked by muscarinic receptor antagonists. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the increase in MAP and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) evoked by intravenous administration of McN-A-343 to urethane-anaesthetized rats. 2. McN-A-343 (0.1-0.3 mg kg-1) evoked a concurrent increase in MAP and RSNA which could be inhibited by the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist methylatropine or the selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist telenzepine. Administration of higher doses of McN-A-343 (0.3-1.2 mg kg-1) in the presence of muscarinic receptor blockade evoked brief bursts in RSNA accompanied by increases in MAP. 3. The increases in MAP, but not the increases in RSNA, evoked by all doses of McN-A-343 could be attenuated by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Adding the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine to prazosin did not further inhibit the pressor response to the low doses of McN-A-343. 4. The irreversible alpha-adrenoceptor and NPY receptor antagonist benextramine also attenuated the pressor response evoked by the low doses of McN-A-343 but not the increases in RSNA. However, when combined with muscarinic receptor blockade, benextramine completely inhibited the brief bursts in RSNA, and thus also the increases in MAP, evoked by the high doses of McN-A-343. 5. The pressor response remaining after the administration of high doses of McN-A-343 to rats pretreated with prazosin and methylatropine was inhibited by treatment with alpha,beta-methylene ATP. 6. These results show that McN-A-343 evokes increases in RSNA by muscarinic and non-muscarinic mechanisms. Furthermore, the subsequent increase in MAP is primarily dependent upon activation of vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors, but may also involve activation of P2 alpha receptors.", 
    "3": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the most serious and potentially fatal side effect of neuroleptics, is characterized by altered consciousness, extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperthermia, elevated plasma creatine phosphoidnase and leukocytosis. In the child and adolescent population, the syndrome may be underrecognized or underreported. We describe a 15-year-old girl who developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after a single injection of two different neuroleptics. We find the case interesting because the patient's course was unusual, and she was treated successfully with the combination of diazepam and biperiden. Our aim is to discuss several aspects of the syndrome through this case, particularly the problem of recognition.", 
    "4": "The appearance of involuntary movements in the clinical course of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (DSR) constitutes a rare clinical entity. In this context, the most frequent changes in movements are muscle spasms and focal dystonia, although postural tremor, muscle weakness and rhythmic myoclonus have also been described. The disorder is more frequent in young women and in the lower limbs. It may have a focal, segmental, multifocal, hemicorporal or symmetrical distribution. It is almost always secondary to local trauma. The pathogenesis and most effective treatment are unknown. We present the case of a 62 year old woman with muscle spasms of both legs and feet as a complication of spontaneously appearing DSR. The electromyogram showed continuous non-rhythmic discharges with morphologically normal motor unit potentials in both anterior tibial muscles. The clinical course and symptomatic improvement following treatment with benzodiazepine seems to suggest that the disorder is of central origin.", 
    "5": "1. The behavioral and anticonvulsant effects of several 1, 4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) and azirino[1,2-d] [1, 4]benzodiazepine (ABDZ) derivatives were studied after intraperitoneal administration in DBA/2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures. 2. The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated on seizures evoked by means of auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12-16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a Perspex dome. 3. The 1,4-benzodiazepines were generally more potent than the related azirino[1,2-d] [1,4]benzodiazepine derivatives which, however, showed a remarkable anticonvulsant activity. The rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity was flunitrazepam > diazepam > pinazepam > ABDZ5 > ABDZ4 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ1 > ABDZ3 > camazepam > ABDZ6 > ABDZ2. 4. The impairment of locomotor performance following intraperitoneal (IP) administration of the aforementioned derivatives was also evaluated by means of rotarod test. The rank order of potency for impairment of coordinated motor movements was pinazepam > flunitrazepam > diazepam > ABDZ5 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ4 > ABDZ3 > ABDZ1 > camazepam > ABDZ2 = ABDZ6. 5. A hypothermic activity was observed after the highest doses of the benzodiazepines studied. 6. The potency of various 1,4-benzodiazepines and azirino[1, 2-d][1,4]benzodiazepines as inhibitors of specific [3H]flumazenil binding to membranes from cerebellum or cortex was evaluated. In general, they inhibited [3H]flumazenil binding at the micromolar range. However, some ABDZ derivatives, although active as anticonvulsants, failed to displace [3H]flumazenil. 7. The azirino[1,2-d] [1,4]benzodiazepine derivatives are more lipophilic than the related benzodiazepines, but the different degree of anticonvulsant activity and impairment of coordinated motor movements cannot be directly related to the lipophilicity of the compounds studied. 8. The pharmacologic actions of ABDZ4 and ABDZ5, which appeared as the most potent anticonvulsants of the azirino[1,2-d] [1,4]benzodiazepine derivatives, were significantly reduced by treatment with flumazenil (8.24 mumol/kg IP) suggesting a clear involvement of benzodiazepine mechanisms in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds or their metabolites. 9. The anticonvulsant activity of ABDZ4 and ABDZ5 was also evaluated against seizures induced by the two beta-carbolines, methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), in DBA/2 mice. Both ABDZ4 and ABDZ5 gave better protection against the seizures induced by beta-CCM than DMCM, suggesting a preferential action on BDZ1 receptors.", 
    "6": "A third of a million adults in the UK sleepwalk while a million suffer from night terrors. In both conditions the individual is unaware of the fullness of their surroundings and is totally focussed in their concern or activity. Doctors are only likely to become involved if the individual comes to harm or seeks help or if other people are inconvenienced or threatened. The constitutional basis of the disorder is beyond doubt, although the actual expression may be related to stressful life-events resulting from an individual's personality, relationships and circumstances. Treatment may include the provision of a secure environment, counselling, and the use of benzodiazepines and serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.", 
    "7": "The results of the present study suggest that the pancreas and parotid glands both respond with hypoplasia during absence of food in the digestive tract and with hyperplasia following pancreatico-biliary diversion (PBD). Factors other than cholecystokinin (CCK) are, however, involved in the effects on the parotid glands, since infusion of CCK-8S and devazepide was without influence.", 
    "8": "Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) causes reduced pancreatic weight, whereas PBD evokes hyperCCKemia and enlargement of the rat pancreas. The pancreas and parotid glands have in part similar morphology and function. Therefore, we studied the possible presence of alterations also in the parotid glands during TPN, after PBD and during infusion of sulfated cholecystokinin (CCK-8S) and the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide, respectively.", 
    "9": "Rats either received TPN for 7 d, or were kept under otherwise identical conditions with free access to food and water. TPN markedly reduced both pancreatic and parotid wet weight and thereby also the protein and amylase contents, and pancreatic DNA content was decreased. There was a significant correlation between the pancreas and parotid glands when comparing these parameters. The concentration of plasma CCK was unaffected by TPN. PBD caused a sevenfold increase in plasma CCK and a three fold increase in the pancreatic weight compared to control rats 28 d after the operation. The protein and DNA contents in the pancreas were found to be increased. The parotid glands increased twofold in weight, but their protein and amylase contents were not affected. There was a significant correlation between the pancreas and parotid glands when comparing weight, and protein and amylase concentrations. Infusion of CCK-8S during 28 d caused a marked increase in pancreatic wet wt and protein and DNA contents. The CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide induced a reduction in protein and DNA contents in the pancreas. The parotid glands were not affected by either treatment. No effect on the labeling index of serous and ductal cells of the parotid gland was seen at 36 h, 3, 7, and 28 d of infusion with CCK-8S or devazepide.", 
    "10": "Regarding the treatment of insomnia, it is said that a considerable degree of advancement has been made to date in terms of controlling toxicity, preventing the development of tolerance and avoiding addiction, which were often observed when administering barbiturates. Nevertheless, the majority of hypnotics used today, which are benzodiazepines, still retain certain side effects such as hangover effects, development of dependence, rebound insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, muscular atonia resulting in falling down and causing bone fracture, inhibition of respiratory system, negative interaction with alcohol, etc. The current trend of selecting hypnotics is to use short-half-life agents. However, there are yet other problems such as cognitive disorders including amnesia, rebound insomnia and increased anxiety during the daytime. In order to cope with these problems, three new hypnotics have recently been developed. They are non-benzodiazepine derivatives and considered to be safer than the others, because they are supposed to cause less side effects than conventional hypnotics. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these new hypnotics can be summarized as follows: 1) these hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega-1 subtype although the agent itself does not belong to the benzodiazepine derivative family; 2) the half-life-time in the serum is extremely short, namely 1-2 hours; 3) they increase the level of slow waves (delta-wave) during sleep; 4) they have a lesser effect toward atonic muscle and amnestic thought and behavioral disturbance as compared to conventional hypnotics; and 5) the risks of developing drug tolerance and reciprocal negative effects with alcohol are smaller. Consequently, we can expect that these new hypnotics will bring a certain advantage, especially regarding the avoidance of hypnotics-induced side effects in the course of clinical treatment of insomnia in the future.", 
    "11": "The present study was designed to investigate which muscarinic receptors the indoline derivatives interact with and also their pharmacological properties. Compounds I and II contracted guinea-pig ileum in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas compounds III-IX behaved as antagonists and Schild plots gave straight lines. 4-DAMP antagonized the contractile responses to compounds I and II, and the pA2 values for 4-DAMP were 8.96 +/- 0.23 and 9.09 +/- 0.06, respectively. In guinea-pig left atrium, compound I partly inhibited twitch responses, whereas compound II did not have any effect. In rabbit vas deferens, compounds I and II produced inhibitory effects on twitch responses evoked by field stimulation. Pirenzepine antagonized the inhibitory responses of compounds I and II, and the pA2 values for pirenzepine were 7.90 +/- 0.13 and 8.12 +/- 0.06, respectively. Compound I has about 150-fold higher affinity to M1 receptors than to M3 receptors, while compound II has about 360-fold higher affinity to M1 receptors. Our results indicate that compounds I and II show 7- and 16-fold higher M1 receptor selectivity than McN-A-343, respectively. Therefore, compound II is selective for M1 receptors over M2 or M3 receptors.", 
    "12": "This study aims to analyze the effect of the administration of diazepam and alcohol on cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX) in the mammillary bodies (MB) with a quantitative densitometry method. The histochemical reaction of the COX is used as a reflection of energy consumption. Our results show an increase in the COX activity after treatment with diazepam in the different nuclei of MB: medial medial nucleus (MMNm), lateral medial nucleus (MMN1), and lateral nucleus (LMN) of the MB, the MMNm and LMN being significantly more active compared to the MMN1. Furthermore, the consequences of administering these drugs become manifest in spatial learning (water T maze). The performance in a spatial discrimination task did not prove to be impaired.", 
    "13": "The effects of saline and intravenous midazolam (0.5, 1, and 2 mg per 70 kg) in combination with intravenous fentanyl (0.1 mg/70 kg) were examined on pain induced by a cold pressor test. Healthy volunteers (six females, six males) were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover trial in which mood and psychomotor performance were also examined. Five minutes and 135 min postinjection subjects immersed their forearm in ice cold water for 3 min while assessments of pain were recorded. During the first immersion, subjects reported significantly lower pain intensity and bothersomeness ratings after having been injected with fentanyl, relative to the saline condition, but the addition of midazolam neither increased nor decreased pain reports. During the second immersion (approximately 2.5 h postinjection) pain ratings did not differ between the drug and saline conditions. Mood-altering and psychomotor-impairing effects of the drug combination were dose related. We conclude that midazolam at the doses and route of administration tested neither potentiates nor decreases the analgesia produced by fentanyl in a cold-pressor pain assay.", 
    "14": "We have examined the role of benzodiazepine receptors in nitrous oxide-induced neuronal depression in rats. The changes in neuronal excitability induced by nitrous oxide and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, Ro15-4513, were monitored by measurement of visual evoked potentials (VEP). Administration of Ro15-4513 10 mg kg-1 i.p., in rats breathing air, did not affect the amplitude or latency of VEP. However, the same concentrations of Ro15-4513 antagonized nitrous oxide-induced depression of VEP amplitudes. We conclude that antagonism of nitrous oxide-induced depression by Ro15-4513 indicates that at least part of the decreased neuronal excitability caused by nitrous oxide could be ascribed to interactions with the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "15": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are unpleasant, often underestimated side effects of anaesthesia and surgery, not devoid of medical complications. Prevention with antiemetics is only partially effective. Propofol has been shown recently to possess antiemetic properties in several situations. In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we have compared the antiemetic efficacy of subhypnotic doses of propofol, with Intralipid as placebo, after thyroidectomy. We studied 64 patients of both sexes, aged 22-71 yr, ASA I or II, undergoing thyroidectomy. After premedication with a benzodiazepine, balanced anaesthesia was produced with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen, and supplementary analgesia with fentanyl i.v. as required. Postoperative analgesia was provided with non-opioids, and piritramide 0.25 mg kg-1 i.m. on demand. Patients were allocated randomly and blindly to receive a 20-h infusion of either propofol or 10% Intralipid 0.1 ml kg-1 h-1. Intralipid, the excipient of propofol, was chosen as placebo as it is devoid of antiemetic effects. Sedation scores, respiratory and cardiovascular variables, and incidence of PONV were assessed every 4 h for 24 h. Pulse oximetry and ECG were monitored continuously. Both groups were comparable in characteristics, surgical and anaesthesia procedures, amount of opioids given during and after operation, and total amount of the study drug infused after operation. Occurrence of PONV was similar before the start (propofol 41%, Intralipid 50%) and after completion (propofol 0.64%, Intralipid 1.6%) of infusion and decreased with time in both groups during the infusion. However, symptoms were reduced to nil with propofol but persisted and were more severe with Intralipid during infusion (P < or = 0.01). The overall incidence of PONV during infusion was 10% (three of 32 patients) in the propofol group and 65% (21 of 32 patients) in the Intralipid group. Cardiovascular and respiratory variables, and SpO2 were unaltered, and sedation decreased similarly with time in both groups. We conclude that propofol, given at subhypnotic doses, effectively reduced the incidence of PONV without untoward sedative or cardiovascular effects.", 
    "16": "In this study the influence of xylazine upon the threshold of electrically-induced convulsions and the anticonvulsant action of diazepam, phenobarbital and phenytoin was studied in mice. All drugs were given as solutions intraperitoneally (i.p.). Xylazine did not alter seizure threshold at any of the doses tested (range 0-6 mg/kg i.p.). However, when combined with seizure-increasing doses of phenobarbital and phenytoin, xylazine at a dose of 2 mg/kg significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the ability of these anticonvulsants to increase seizure threshold. Xylazine also reduced the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam, though insignificantly. Our data indicate that xylazine should be contraindicated in animals on the anticonvulsant medication.", 
    "17": "The modulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone (3 alpha-OH-DHP) and 3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxicorticosterone (3 alpha-THDOC) was investigated in synaptic membranes isolated from chick optic lobe at three developmental stages, in order to evaluate the role of neurosteroids in central nervous system functional maturation. It was demonstrated that both steroids modulate [3H]flunitrazepam binding in a concentration-dependent manner at embryonic day 14, hatching and adult stage, producing maximal [3H]flunitrazepam binding enhancement at early stages of development and declining thereafter. EC50 values for 3 alpha-OH-DHP were lower than for 3 alpha-THDOC at all stages examined. On the other hand, Emax values were higher with 3 alpha-OH-DHP than with 3 alpha-THDOC. Scatchard analysis performed at embryonic day 14, hatching and adult stage showed that dissociation constants (Kd) were of 22.23 +/- 0.15, 18.38 +/- 1.15 and 19.86 +/- 0.62 nM, and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) were 1.95 +/- 0.15, 3.13 +/- 0.21 and 2.25 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg protein, respectively. By adding 4 microM of either 3 alpha-OH-DHP or 3 alpha-THDOC, Kd values decreased significantly to 10.65 +/- 0.62, 9.71 +/- 0.85 and 13.25 +/- 0.74 nM or 9.54 +/- 0.65, 11.20 +/- 1.27 and 12.96 +/- 1.38 nM, at the above mentioned stages, respectively. Thus, either drug at the given concentration increased the affinity of benzodiazepine receptor sites for [3H]flunitrazepam, while the density of receptor sites remained unchanged. Our results suggest that these steroids display a positive allosteric modulation of benzodiazepine receptor sites which is inversely related to age.", 
    "18": "The time- and temperature-dependencies of binding are overviewed for the benzodiazepine, GABA and convulsant binding sites of the GABAA receptor-ionophore complex. Kinetic separation of the dissociation phases of a beta-carboline inverse agonist demonstrated the heterogeneity of its binding sites. The kinetics and thermodynamics of benzodiazepine binding alone do not correlate with ionophore function. The majority of the data suggest that agonist- and antagonist-preferring conformations exist for GABAA receptors. The high affinity binding of GABAA antagonists (SR 95531 and bicuculline) corresponds to the (super) low affinity binding of GABA. The correlation between the thermodynamic parameters of binding and efficacies common for GABAA and glycine receptor agonists and antagonists supports the functional similarities of these anionophore complexes. Binding kinetics of the bicyclic cage convulsants show several correlations with ionophore function because the convulsant sites are most intimately coupled to the ion channels. Kinetic interactions of the convulsant sites with the binding sites of benzodiazepines, GABA and central depressants have revealed several pharmacologically relevant allosteric GABAergic modulatory effects. Arrhenius analysis, Hammond's postulate and transition state theory were applied for the dissociation of convulsants. A kinetic model of interconvertible multiaffinity states of the convulsant sites shows correlations with the functional states of the GABAA ionophore.", 
    "19": "1. Physical dependence and cross-physical dependence on barbital of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist S-(+)-DN-2327 and the benzodiazepine receptor full agonist diazepam were compared in male Fischer 344 rats. 2. In the physical dependence study, rats were treated with S-(+)-DN-2327 (30, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day) or diazepam (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks by the drug admixed with food method. After stopping the treatment, the body weight and food consumption in the diazepam 100 and 300 mg/kg groups tended to decrease or decreased to values lower than those in the control group, whereas these parameters in the S-(+)-DN-2327 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg groups were comparable to the control group values. 3. In the cross-dependence study, rats were treated with increasing doses of barbital by admixing the drug with food for 4 weeks, after which the diet admixed with barbital was replaced by basal diet alone or admixed with S-(+)-DN-2327 or diazepam (target doses: 100 and 300 mg/kg/day for each compound). During the substitution period, the decreases in body weight and food consumption in both S-(+)-DN-2327 and both diazepam groups were suppressed compared with those in the basal diet group. 4. These results suggest that S-(+)-DN-2327 possesses minimal physical dependence-producing liability, but shows cross-dependence on barbital, as do benzodiazepine receptor full agonists.", 
    "20": "1. Lymphocyte subsets and neutrophil function were studied in chronic psychiatric patients on long-term multiple drug therapy, and the correlation with disease and drug treatments was also investigated. 2. Patients showed decreased CD4+ percentage, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, B lymphocyte percentage, increased absolute and percentage NK, and impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and oxidative metabolism. Correlations were found between: patient status and lower CD4+ percentage, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and oxidative metabolism; schizophrenia and higher absolute and percentage NK, and neutrophil random migration; benzodiazepines and higher CD8+ absolute number and lower NBT reduction frequency; carbamazepine and higher NK percentage, neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, stimulated O2-production, and lower microbicidal activity. 3. The present study provides direct evidence for the existence of immunologic abnormalities in a population of chronic psychiatric patients on long-term drug therapy. Although a possible role by other factors could not be excluded, such abnormalities are strongly associated with chronic administration of benzodiazepines and carbamazepine. Further investigations are warranted to confirm these findings and disclose the possible mechanism(s) involved.", 
    "21": "A 52-year-old female patient who was medicated chronically with sodium valproate, an anticonvulsant drug, underwent spino-peritoneal shunt operation. Firstly, spinal drain was placed under local anesthesia and with intravenous diazepam, which was antagonized by flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, without adverse effect. Secondly, peritoneal drain was placed and shunt operation was completed under general anesthesia. After the operation flumazenil was administered again in order to accelerate anesthesia recovery. Just after the second flumazenil administration she developed generalised convulsion and coma. Convulsion disappeared immediately and full consciousness was restored several hours after the attack. We have discussed the possible mechanism of the flumazenil-induced convulsion.", 
    "22": "Recently, attention has been drawn to the significant occurrence of respiratory and other complications during upper intestinal endoscopy. This prospective study was designed to compare the incidence and severity of oxygen desaturation when two different methods of oxygen delivery were used during elective oesophagogastroduodenoscopy.", 
    "23": "After local medical ethics committee approval and written informed consent, one hundred patients undergoing elective oesophagogastroduodenoscopy were randomly allocated to receive supplemental oxygen at either four litres per minute via nasal specular or ten litres per minute through a specially modified non-rebreathing mask. Oxygen saturations during endoscopy facilitated by midazolam sedation were recorded, and non-parametric tests were used to compare the oxygen saturations in the two groups.", 
    "24": "The mean oxygen saturations were significantly better during the procedure for American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade 2 and 3 patients who received oxygen with the modified mask than for those who received oxygen via nasal specular (98.6% vs. 97.0%, P = 0.004 for ASA grade 2 and 98.4% vs. 95.5, P = 0.006 for ASA grade 3).", 
    "25": "For ASA grade 2 and 3 patients, the modified non-rebreathing mask significantly improves oxygen saturations during upper intestinal endoscopy. This technique should be more widely used for patients at moderate and high risk.", 
    "26": "The effects of pretreatment with a benzodiazepine, diazepam, on the atrial tissue of rats exposed to noise were studied by means of electron microscopy. Examination of ultrathin sections showed that acute stress caused swelling of mitochondria with cristolysis and matrix dissolution. In diazepam-pretreated and noise-exposed animals atrial cardiomyocytes did not reveal noteworthy changes in comparison with controls and the majority of mitochondria were well preserved. Present findings indicate that diazepam is able to exert a protective action on cardiac alterations due to noise exposure, especially at the mitochondrial level.", 
    "27": "We objectively delineated the extent of abnormalities in central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR) binding using [11C]flumazenil (FMZ)-PET and high resolution volumetric MRI in 12 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) associated with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, who underwent presurgical evaluation and subsequent temporal lobe surgery. We compared parametric 3D-images of regional cerebral [11C]FMZ volume of distribution (Vd) obtained from individuals and groups of patients with [11C]FMZ-Vd from a group of 17 healthy controls using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The [12C]FMZ-Vd was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) in the affected hippocampus in the group of 12 patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis. Analysis of individual patients reflected the group finding and there was no significant abnormality of cBZR binding outside the hippocampus in any patient. We conclude that SPM is an useful objective method for detecting changes in regional cerebral [11C]FMZ binding and that in patients with mTLE and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis reduction of cBZR binding is restricted to the area of hippocampal sclerosis with no abnormalities being detected in the temporal neocortex or elsewhere in the neocortex.", 
    "28": "Rats exposed to aversive stimuli display species specific defence behaviour as part of their natural survival strategy. one component of this behaviour is the production of ultrasonic calls in the 20 to 27-kHz range, which are thought to serve a communicative role. The present study has examined the behavioural effects of exposing rats to artificially generated ultrasound and the ability of three distinct pharmacological agents to modify this response. Single tone 20 kHz ultrasound exposure for 1 min produced intensity-related locomotor behaviour, characteristic of defence behaviour, which could be measured using a computer tracking system. This was significantly reduced by peripheral pretreatment with the benzodiazepine, diazepam (0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg IP). Pretreatment with the 5-HT agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP) (0.5-2.0 mg/kg IP) produced a dose-related reduction in the ultrasound-induced response. The alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg IP), caused an increase in the response at the lower dose (0.5 mg/kg) and a decrease at the two higher doses (2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg). The present findings suggest that defence behaviour in the rat can be artificially produced by 20 kHz ultrasound; this is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation and may offer a novel animal model of aversive behaviours that are associated with human panic.", 
    "29": "Effects of smoking and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) status on the single dose kinetics of zotepine and pharmacokinetic interaction between zotepine and diazepam were investigated. In 14 healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of zotepine after a single oral 25 mg dose were compared between eight smokers and six non-smokers, or between seven extensive metabolizers (EMs) and seven poor metabolizers (PMs) of S-mephenytoin. There was no significant difference in any pharmacokinetic parameters between smokers and non-smokers, or between the EM and PM groups. In 17 patients treated with zotepine 80-340 mg/day, intra-individual changes in plasma concentrations of zotepine caused by coadministration of diazepam 10 mg/day for 2 weeks were examined. Plasma concentrations of zotepine were significantly increased after coadministration of diazepam (P < 0.05). Consequently, it is suggested that neither smoking nor CYP2C19 status affects the metabolism of zotepine.

The present experiments investigated whether peeps and other vocalizations emitted during different social contexts are pharmacologically altered in a similar manner. First, vocalizations were characterized during (1) social separation in juveniles, and (2) \"resident-intruder\" aggressive confrontations between dominant monkeys from different social groups. Then, the effects of alcohol (EtOH) and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on vocalizations during social separation and during aggression were examined. Isolated juveniles emitted only one type of call, the isolation peep. Resident monkeys primarily emitted peeps, but also emitted cackles, chucks, noisy calls and pulsed calls. Aggressive peeps were similar in structure and frequency (kHz) to isolation peeps, but were shorter in duration. At the same doses, both CDP (0.3-3 mg/kg) and EtOH (0.1-1.0 g/kg) reduced explosive motor behaviors and isolation peeps in juvenile monkeys during social separation and increased threat displays and aggression peeps in resident monkeys during confrontations with an intruder monkey from a different social group. Thus, similarly structured vocalizations that were emitted during social separation and aggression were very sensitive to EtOH and CDP, but the social context determined the direction and magnitude of effects.",

Although pain intensity scores were lower after 20 minutes and sedation was more pronounced in the MA group, both drug regimens produced satisfactory sedation and analgesia and allowed the maximum number of shockwaves to be given. Alfentanil consumption was less in the MA group (P < 0.05). Both groups were hemodynamically stable. The patients in the MA group had slower ventilation rates, lower oxygen saturation, and higher end-tidal carbon dioxide levels. Use of MA was associated with more episodes of oxygen desaturation to < 90% (30% vs. 11%; P < 0.05). One patient in the PA group and three patients in the MA group developed bradypnea (< 10 breaths/min). Patient satisfaction was very high with the two sedative-analgesic techniques. Propofol and midazolam, when given in combination with alfentanil using a PCA pump, may provide safe, effective analgesia and sedation during lithotripsy. Patient-controlled sedation and analgesia may provide optimal conditions for SWL of urinary tract stones and is a useful alternative to other forms of anesthesia and analgesia.",

    "43": "Drugs may be the most frequent single cause of delirium, and very often they are a critical element in a multifactorial aetiology. While delirium may be precipitated by virtually any drug, certain classes of drugs are more commonly implicated. Effective management of drug-induced delirium involves recognition, cessation or dosage reduction of the causative drug(s), and initiation of reorientation strategies and supportive medical care. Specific \"antidotes' are appropriate in only a few limited cases. Drug treatment aimed at sedation should be introduced for specific indications, such as aggression, risk of harm to self or others, hallucinations, patient distress, and where compliance with therapy or procedures is essential. Certain benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) and/or haloperidol may be the most appropriate choices in these circumstances. Primary prevention requires the prescription of alternative lower risk medications and the minimisation of polypharmacy. Secondary prevention may be achieved through improved recognition of the condition.", 
    "44": "We sought to test the hypotheses that closely related alcohols would have effects on GABAA receptor function that were not predicted by differences in lipid solubility, and that the subunit structure of the GABAA receptor would significantly affect the actions of different alcohols. Cloned subunits of human GABAA receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording was used to quantify the membrane current response to GABA in the presence and absence of different alcohols. 1-Butanol and 2-butanol differentially potentiated the response to 20 microM GABA in oocytes expressing the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L and alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2L receptor isoforms. In the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L receptor construct, 1-butanol was more potent than 2-butanol to potentiate GABAA receptor function, but 2-butanol had a greater efficacy. In the alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2L receptor construct, 1-butanol and 2-butanol were equipotent, but 2-butanol again had a greater efficacy. In the alpha 2 beta 2 receptor construct, both 1-butanol and 2-butanol produced large potentiations of the current response to 3 microM GABA. The efficacy for butanol potentiation of GABA responses in the absence of a gamma 2L subunit was greater, but the potency was greatly reduced. Low concentrations (20 mM) of ethanol potentiated GABA responses in the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L receptor construct. Ethanol potentiation of GABAA receptor function was completely blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist RO15-4513 at a concentration (0.5 microM) that did not alter the control GABA response. In contrast, RO15-4513 did not block potentiation of GABAA receptor activity induced by n-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-heptanol, or propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol). These results suggest that alcohols have specific interactions with GABAA receptors, and that ethanol may have unique effects not shared by other longer chain alcohols.",

Four poor metabolizers (PM) were identified by phenotyping with mephenytoin and by genotyping for CYP2C19. 2. Serum diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography in samples drawn up to 24 days after administration. 3. The plasma elimination half-lives of diazepam (100.8 +/- 32.3 h) and desmethyldiazepam (219.9 +/- 62.7 h) in PMs were significantly longer than those (34.7 +/- 23.0 h for diazepam, 103.1 +/- 25.9 h for desmethyldiazepam) of the 17 phenotyped extensive metabolizers (EM), and those (30.8 +/- 24.9 h for diazepam, 103.1 +/- 27.5 h for desmethyldiazepam) of the five genotyped EMs. 4.

On day 4, they took a 0.25 mg oral dose of triazolam, after which plasma samples were collected and pharmacodynamic effects measured for 18 h. 3. The mean area under the triazolam concentration-time curve (AUC) was increased 1.6-, 2.1- and 4.4-fold (P < 0.001) by fluconazole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg, respectively. The increase in the elimination half-life of triazolam (t1/2,z) varied from 1.3-fold (fluconazole 50 mg, P < 0.05) to 2.3-fold (fluconazole 200 mg, P < 0.001). The peak concentration of triazolam was also increased significantly during all fluconazole phases; more than twofold by fluconazole 200 mg (P < 0.001). 4.

    "57": "1. Nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) is a nucleus composed entirely of GABAergic neurons, which functions as a pacemaker to synchronize thalamocortical oscillations. To study the functional properties of GABAergic inhibition mediated through activation of gamma-aminobuturic acid-A (GABAA) receptors in these cells, neurons were isolated acutely from NRT at various postnatal developmental stages and recorded from using whole cell patch-clamp techniques. 2. Application of GABA to NRT neurons elicited a large, bicuculline sensitive current with an average reversal potential of -60.6 +/- 1.9 mV (mean +/- SD) in postnatal day (p) 19-21 neurons and -51.2 +/- 3.1 mV in p7 neurons, presumably mediated through activation of a GABAA-mediated chloride conductance. The potency of GABA in activating GABAA receptors decreased significantly with postnatal development in NRT neurons and was best fitted with EC50s of 24.9, 33.9, and 67.2 microM, in neurons isolated from p5-9, p18-25, and p58-74 rats, respectively. The density of GABAA receptors in the membranes of NRT neurons increased significantly with postnatal development. In addition, the GABA current decay rate slowed significantly in neurons isolated from older animals relative to early postnatal rat pups. 3. Both the potency and efficacy of benzodiazepine augmentation of GABAA responses in NRT neurons increased significantly with development. The EC50 of clonazepam decreased from 26 to 6 nM in p5-9 and p58-74 NRT neurons, respectively, whereas the efficacy increased from 126 to 163% augmentation over the same developmental range. 4. The elevated efficacy of clonazepam (CNZ) in NRT neurons relative to thalamic and cortical neurons, particularly in neurons isolated from adult (> p58) rats, is consistent with the anticonvulsant profile of this drug in controlling Generalized Absence epilepsy. Augmenting inhibition within NRT would enhance NRT/ NRT inhibitory connections and thereby decrease the amplitude of NRT-mediated synchronizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials onto thalamus (where CNZ has low efficacy), in turn making it more difficult to elicit burst firing in thalamus due to deinactivation and subsequent activation of the low-threshold Ca2+ current. 5. The present developmental profile of GABAA responses in GABAergic NRT neurons provides data important in understanding the role of GABAergic inhibition within NRT in the modulation of normal and pathological thalamocortical rhythms in the brain and is also relevant in understanding potential differences in GABAA receptor physiology and pharmacology in GABAergic interneurons relative to glutamatergic neurons.",

In the present study, we examined the cellular mechanism and receptor type responsible for a muscarine-induced inward current (Imi) in neurons of rat dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) using single-microelectrode voltage-clamp and \"slice\" patch-clamp techniques. 2. Imi was associated with an increase of membrane conductance in 75% of DLSN neurons. There was no voltage-dependence of Imi between -60 and -140 mV; it exhibited a reversal potential of -17.0 +/- 5.3 mV (n = 14) determined by extrapolation of Imi and voltage relationship recorded using whole cell patch recording. Lowering extracellular sodium (26 mM) or potassium (1.4 mM) ions depressed Imi. 3. Imi was concentration dependent; 3 and 100 microM muscarine produced the minimum [22 +/- 4.6 pA, (mean +/- SE) n = 8] and maximum (167 +/- 28 pA, n = 7) responses, respectively. An EC50 was determined to be 15 microM (n = 8). Oxotremorine-methiodide (1-100 microM) also produced an inward current with similar potency compared with muscarine. On the other hand, McN-A-343 and pilocarpine (3-100 microM) did not produce any inward current in DLSN neurons. 4. Atropine (1 microM) completely reduced Im produced by 30 microM muscarine, whereas pirenzepine (PZP) shifted the concentration-response curve for muscarine in a parallel manner to the right. The EC50 for muscarine was shifted to 32, 52, and 204 microM by 0.2, 0.5, and 2 microM PZP, respectively. The apparent Kd value for PZP estimated by Schild plot analysis was 190 nM (n = 5). 5. Methoctramine (1 microM) also competitively depressed Imi; the calculated EC50 values were 26, 41, and 107 microM in concentrations of 0.2, 2, and 10 microM methoctramine, respectively. The apparent Kd for methoctramine was 420 nM. In contrast, AF-DX 116 (1 microM) did not significantly inhibit Imi. 6. Intracellular dialysis with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, suppressed irreversibly Imi. Pretreatment of DLSN neurons with pertussis toxin (PTX) did not prevent Imi (n = 8). 7. We suggest that muscarine causes this inward current by activating a M3 subtype of muscarinic receptor, which is coupled to a PTX-insensitive GTP-protein in rat DLSN neurons.", 
    "59": "There is much evidence that progesterone has hypnotic anesthetic properties. In this vehicle-controlled study, we examined the effects of three doses of progesterone (30, 90, and 180 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally at light onset on sleep in rats. Progesterone dose dependently shortened non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) latency, lengthened rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) latency, decreased the amount of wakefulness and REMS, and markedly increased pre-REMS, an intermediate state between NREMS and REMS. Progesterone also elicited dose-related changes in sleep state-specific electroencephalogram (EEG) power densities. Within NREMS, EEG activity was reduced in the lower frequencies (< or = 7 Hz) and was enhanced in the higher frequencies. Within REMS, EEG activity was markedly enhanced in the higher frequencies. The effects were maximal during the first postinjection hours. The concentrations of progesterone and the progesterone metabolites 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one, both positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors, were determined at different time intervals after vehicle and 30 or 90 mg/kg progesterone. Progesterone administration resulted in dose-dependent initially supraphysiological elevations of progesterone and its metabolites in the plasma and brain, which were most prominent during the first hour postinjection. The effects of progesterone on sleep closely resemble those of agonistic modulators of GABAA receptors such as benzodiazepines and correlate well with the increases in the levels of its GABAA agonistic metabolites. These observations suggest that the hypnotic effects of progesterone are mediated by the facilitating action of its neuroactive metabolites on GABAA receptor functioning.",

Heart rate, presence of 2nd degree atrioventricular heart blocks (2 degrees AVB), respiratory rate, arterial blood pressures, blood gases, packed cell volume, total serum proteins, and duration of anesthesia and recumbency were recorded. Induction and recovery quality was evaluated using a 0 to 4 score. Response to stimulation with noise, pressure, and cutaneous electrical stimulation was assessed at 5 minute intervals during recumbency to evaluate the depth of anesthesia. Heart rate was lower and 2 degrees AVB more frequent in the romifidine group, while blood pressure was lower in the xylazine group. Duration of anesthesia was longer in the romifidine group (mean 20.8, s mean 2.3 min) versus the xylazine group (mean 15.8, s mean 1.6 min), while induction and recovery were excellent in both groups.

The study was a household survey of a stratified sample (N = 1,500) of the Santiago (Chile) population performed by trained interviewers. Data were collected by structured questionnaires on demographic characteristics, drug use, psychoactive substance use disorders, and other psychosocial variables. Past-year prevalence of benzodiazepine use was 31.4%, daily use of benzodiazepines for > or = 12 months, 5.9%, and subjects who met DSM-III-R criteria for dependence, 3.3%. Seventy-four percent of subjects obtained the benzodiazepine over-the-counter (always 45%; sometimes 29%). No subject acknowledged recreational benzodiazepine use or met criteria for benzodiazepine abuse. Use, long-term use, and dependence occurred equally frequently among both over-the-counter and prescription benzodiazepine users.

In 171 patients who were supervised during medication tapering and discontinuation, the most common symptoms were dizziness, lethargy, paresthesia, nausea, vivid dreams, irritability, and lowered mood. When patients with at least one qualitatively new symptom were defined as cases, these symptoms occurred significantly more frequently in patients who had been treated either with one of the shorter half-life SSRIs, fluvoxamine or paroxetine (17.2%), or with clomipramine (30.8%), than in patients taking one of the SSRIs with longer half-life metabolites, sertraline or fluoxetine (1.5%). The rate was not significantly different between the different shorter half-life treatments. Cases treated with fluvoxamine or paroxetine had received a significantly longer period of treatment (median 28 weeks) than noncases (16 weeks), but there were no significant associations with age or with diagnostic grouping. There was a trend toward an association with male sex. The majority of cases occurred despite slowly tapered withdrawal. Symptoms persisted for up to 21 days (mean = 11.8 days) after onset. These symptoms were relieved within 24 hours by restarting the medication, but were not relieved by benzodiazepines or by moclobemide. A role has been suggested for serotonin in coordinating sensory and autonomic function with motor activity. We suggest that this may lead to useful hypotheses about the pathophysiology of withdrawal symptoms from serotonin reuptake inhibitors.", 
    "78": "Venlafaxine (V) is a second-generation antidepressant approved for use in the United States in 1993. It is a derivative of phenethylamine and is structurally unrelated to first- and other second-generation antidepressants. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action is similar to other antidepressants; it inhibits the reuptake of presynaptic norepinephrine and serotonin. Its major routes of elimination involve O and N demethylation. O-Desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) is biologically active. Therapeutic concentrations of V and ODV are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 mg/L, respectively. Three cases of drug intoxication involving V are presented. V and ODV were identified by gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection after alkaline extraction of the biological specimen. On an HP-5 column, V and ODV elute after bupropion and fluoxetine, but prior to the first-generation antidepressants, sertraline, amoxapine, and trazodone. V and ODV were confirmed by full scan electron impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The heart-blood V and ODV concentrations (mg/L) in the three cases were 6.6 and 31; 84 and 15; and 44 and 50, respectively. In Case 1, acetaminophen and diphenhydramine were found in the heart blood at 140 and 2.6 mg/L respectively. In Case 2, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and chlordiazepoxide were found in the blood at 2.8, 0.5 and 3.3 mg/L, respectively. In each case, the manner of death was suicide.", 
    "79": "An automated high-performance liquid chromatographic method, benzodiazepines by REMEDi HS, was used to analyze benzodiazepines and their metabolites after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis of 1-mL urine specimens from the following: 924 clinic and hospital patients whose specimens had previously been found to be presumptively positive using either EMIT or Triage immunoassay methodologies and 128 individuals whose specimens had screened negative by EMIT d.a.u.TM. REMEDi analyses did not correlate with the immunoassay results in 136 of the positive and three of the negative urine specimens. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) confirmatory analyses were performed on these discordant specimens using 3 mL beta-glucuronidase-hydrolyzed urine followed by extraction with chloroform-isopropanol (9:1) and derivatization with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Two benzodiazepines, flunitrazepam and clonazepam, and their 7-amino metabolites were analyzed without prior derivatization. The analyses established 87% concordance between REMEDi and GC-MS versus 13% concordance with immunoassay for the subset. GC-MS analysis of these 142 specimens demonstrated two reasons for the nonconcurrence between REMEDi and EMIT: EMIT had given either false-negative or false-positive results and EMIT had given a positive result even though the determined metabolites were below the 200-ng/mL cutoff for the immunoassay and the 80-ng/mL cutoff for REMEDi. A total of 23 specimens were found to contain only lorazepam by REMEDi and GC-MS, 15 of which had been screened by Triage. A reevaluation of these 23 specimens by EMIT d.a.u. demonstrated that 11 were positive. This finding was in contrast to previous reports that EMIT will not detect lorazepam glucuronide in urine. An unexpected finding was the REMEDi identification and subsequent GC-MS confirmation of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, a urinary metabolite of flunitrazepam that is not available in the United States and that represented illicit use by four patients. A distinct advantage of REMEDi proved to be its capability in identifying demoxepam, a major metabolite of chlordiazepoxide; GC-MS analysis could not detect this metabolite because of its thermal decomposition to nordiazepam. To further evaluate the specificity of REMEDi, we conducted GC-MS analyses in a random fashion on 55 additional nondiscordant urine specimens that were identified as either positive or negative, as well as 22 specimens identified as containing 7-aminoclonazepam by REMEDi. Concurrence was observed between the two methods for all specimens, with the exception of one apparent false positive for alpha-hydroxyalprazolam by REMEDi. The reproducibility of the REMEDi method was found to be excellent; it was assessed by comparing results of 266 specimens that were reprocessed in different batches and for known calibrators and controls also processed with each batch. Study results demonstrated that the automated REMEDi assay for urinary benzodiazepines and their metabolites was comparable with GC-MS but had distinct advantages over GC-MS because of the following reasons: simplicity of the assay, less time required for analyses, and provision of additional information concerning the parent benzodiazepine.", 
    "80": "For many years, toxicologists have detected the presence of drugs of abuse in biological materials using blood or urine. In recent years, remarkable advances in sensitive analytical techniques have enabled the analysis of drugs in unconventional samples such as sweat. In a study conducted in a detoxification center, sweat patches were applied to 20 known heroin abusers. Subjects wore the patch with minimal discomfort for five days. During the same period, two urine specimens were also collected. Target drugs analyzed either by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) included opiates (heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine, codeine), cocaine (cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester), delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, benzodiazepines (nordiazepam, oxazepam), amphetamines (amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine [MDA], methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA], methylenedioxyethylamphetamine [MDEA]), and buprenorphine. Patches were positive for opiates in 12 cases. Heroin (37-175 ng/patch) and/or 6-acetylmorphine (60-2386 ng/patch) were identified in eight cases, and codeine exposure (67-4018 ng/patch) was determined in four cases. When detected, heroin was always present in lower concentrations than 6-acetylmorphine, which was the major analyte found in sweat. Cocaine (324 ng/patch) and metabolites were found in only one case. delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (4-38 ng/patch) was identified in nine cases. Benzodiazepine concentrations were very low, ranging from 2 to 44 and from 2 to 15 ng/patch for nordiazepam and oxazepam, respectively. MDEA (121 ng/patch) and its metabolite, MDA (22 ng/patch), were detected in one case. Buprenorphine, which was administered as therapy under close medical supervision, was detected in the range 1.3-153.2 ng/patch with no apparent relationship between the daily dose and amount excreted in sweat. All the urine tests were consistent with the sweat findings, but to identify the same drugs it was necessary to test two urine specimens along with only one sweat specimen. It was concluded that sweat testing appears to offer the advantage of being a relatively noninvasive means of obtaining a cumulative estimate of drug exposure over the period of a week. This new technology may find useful applications in the treatment and monitoring of substance abusers, as the patch provides a long-term continuous monitor of drug exposure or noncompliance.", 
    "81": "The present study evaluated the relationship between diagnoses of cocaine and sedative dependence and drug use early in treatment among opioid-dependent patients in methadone substitution therapy. New admissions (n = 138) were assessed via the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM III-R (SCID) for presence of Axis I and Axis II disorders and followed for five weeks on standard methadone maintenance. Patients submitted urines three times per week tested for opioids, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. Patients diagnosed with current cocaine dependence (n = 90) submitted a higher proportion of cocaine-positive urines (M = 0.84) than patients diagnosed with past cocaine dependence (n = 32; M = 0.28) and those diagnosed with no cocaine use disorder (n = 14; M = 0.12), P < 0.001. Current cocaine dependence diagnosis accounted for 52% of the cocaine use variance. Patients exhibiting current sedative dependence (n = 25) submitted a higher proportion of benzodiazepine-positive urines (M = 0.60) than patients with past sedative dependence (n = 44; M = 0.20) and those with no sedative use disorder (n = 60; M = 0.05), P < 0.001. Current sedative dependence diagnosis accounted for 37% of the benzodiazepine use variance. Lifetime major depression (12%) and antisocial personality disorder (39%) were the most common nonsubstance use comorbid diagnoses. Axis I nonsubstance use disorder was associated with benzodiazepine use, while Axis II disorder was associated with both benzodiazepine and cocaine use early in treatment (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate the concurrent validity of DSM-III-R cocaine and benzodiazepine use diagnoses, and support the potentially important relationship between drug use and other psychiatric disorders.", 
    "82": "We determined the influence of M1-muscarinic pathways in modulating temporal cycling of motor and secretory activity in the fasting upper gut. Eight healthy subjects were studied on two separate days, following a double-blind, randomized protocol. Antroduodenal motility (migrating motor complex, MMC), pancreatic exocrine secretion (amylase, lipase, trypsin, chymotrypsin), and plasma levels of associated hormones [motilin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP)] were monitored for two consecutive cycles during background infusion of placebo or telenzepine, a selective M1-muscarinic receptor antagonist. On placebo days, pancreatic enzymes and hormones cycled in synchrony with motor activity, as expected. During M1 blockade, duodenal output of each enzyme was decreased by 85-90% in phase I and by > 90% in phase III. Similarly, plasma concentrations of hormones were decreased during all phases and cycling was absent. Despite the loss of these putative influences, intestinal motility continued to cycle, albeit in an altered fashion. Intermittent phase II activity was replaced by phase I quiescence, while phase III-like fronts were diminished (contraction frequency, amplitude, propagation velocity reduced 30-60%, duration not altered) but recurred at expected intervals (cycle length 105 +/- 14 min vs 109 +/- 12 in placebo). Gastric motor activity was virtually abolished. These data suggest or extend several working hypotheses: (1) Motilin is released and/or acts via cholinergic (M1-muscarinic) pathways to initiate antral, but not duodenal, phase III activity. (2) M1 receptors mediate all components of the gastric MMC and phase II activity throughout the gut, but intestinal phase III activity arises via alternate pathways. (3) M1-muscarinic mechanisms regulate interdigestive cycling of pancreatic enzymes and PP. (4) Secretions from the endocrine/exocrine pancreas are not primary mediators of intestinal motility.",

    "84": "Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia. The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward. This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis.", 
    "85": "Our aim was to determine the effects of two commonly used sedatives, promethazine and diazepam, on arousal and cardiorespiratory responses to airflow obstruction in sleeping lambs. In eight lambs fitted with obstructable rubber face masks, we recorded electrocortical, electroocular, and electromyographic activities to identify sleep-wake states; intrapleural pressure, heart rate, and percentage O2 saturation (Sao2) were also recorded. In each lamb, arousal and respiratory responses were measured after tidal airflow was obstructed during rapid eye movement (REM) and nonREM sleep. Each lamb was studied, on different days, when unsedated and after being mildly sedated with either promethazine or diazepam. Seven of the lambs were studied while sleeping after being sedated with promethazine (1.6 +/- 0.07 mg/kg, orally with milk) and six were studied after sedation with diazepam (0.31 +/- 0.03 mg/kg, intramuscularly). In unsedated lambs, airflow obstruction led to augmentation of respiratory efforts, bradycardia, hypoxemia, and arousal; in REM sleep, arousal was delayed and occurred at lower Sao2 (16 +/- 3 s; 75.3 +/- 3%) compared with nonREM sleep (8 +/- 1 s; 90 +/- 1%). Sedation increased the arousal latency in both REM and nonREM sleep and caused arousal to occur at lower Sao2; in some sedated lambs Sao2 fell to less than 30% before arousal. The augmentation of inspiratory and expiratory efforts immediately before arousal was increased after sedation. We conclude that promethazine and diazepam depress arousal responses in sleeping lambs leading to profound hypoxia, and that this may be due to impaired sensitivity to augmented respiratory efforts and other physiologic changes during airflow obstruction.", 
    "86": "Midazolam (M) is used as an induction agent for anesthesia. The main metabolite is alpha-hydroxymidazolam (OM), which is pharmacologically active. Use of M for sedation is a recent application, rapidly gaining favor. Monitoring of the level of sedation is fundamental in that an excessive and prolonged effect is associated with the risk of complications. Thus, it was felt both necessary and useful to measure circulating M levels. We compared a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay with fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) for the measurement of M in the serum of 138 sedated patients in the intensive care unit (i.e., 179 samples). Response of the OM was also assessed. The degree of crossover of the metabolite was between 76.8 and 32.7%. The equation of the regression line for sigma HPLC (i.e., the sum M + OM) versus FPIA was TDx = 1.1585 sigma HPLC + 143.42 (R = 0.966). The 95% confidence interval for the slope was 1.1551, 1.1619. The regression slope differed significantly from 1 (p < 0.001) and shows that FPIA measurements overestimated concentrations obtained by HPLC on the order of 19%. The discrepancy between the two techniques was all the more notable when concentrations were > 1,000 ng/ml. The relative selectivity of Abbott industrial reagent in terms of benzodiazepines leads to the identification of what might be called a midazolam-like (M-like) activity covering both M and OM. The development of a global FPIA method for measurement of this M-like activity in sedated patients provides a satisfactory solution to the question raised.",

    "103": "This study defined the cholecystokinin (CCK)/gastrin receptor subtypes at which CCK octapeptide (CCK8) and gastrin 17 (G17)act on motor functions of the intact canine gastrointestinal tract. In the antrum, studies of tachyphylaxis and effects of antagonists showed that i.a. G17 acted through CCKB receptors to activate contractions, whereas CCK8 acted through A and B receptor subtypes to produce contractions. In the duodenum, i.a. G17 caused dose-dependent inhibition of electrical field-stimulated contractions, apparently by release of nitric oxide [blocked by N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) or NG-L-arginine methyl ester]. These inhibitory effects were abolished by YM022 (a CCKB antagonist) but not by L-364, 718 (a CCKA antagonist). However, i.a. CCK8 increased electrical field-stimulated contractions and L-364, 718 reversed this effect. In isolated perfused segments of distal intestine, CCK8 caused inhibition and excitation and released vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) into the venous effluent. CCK tetrapeptide and G17 had inconsistent effects. Excitation and VIP release were inhibited by L-364, 718. L-NNA potentiated excitatory responses and abolished inhibitory responses. Tetrodotoxin and atropine abolished and hexamethonium reduced excitatory responses to CCK8, but L-NNA restored contractions after atropine treatment. Hexamethonium or L-NNA (but not atropine) reduced VIP release; CCK8 still enhanced it. L-364, 718 abolished hexamethonium-resistant contractions and VIP release. Thus, CCK/gastrin peptides act on neural receptors in intact canine gastrointestinal tract. In antrum, activation of neural CCKA or CCKB receptors initiates contractions. In intestine, CCKA receptors at pre- and postjunctional sites in enteric nerves mediate acetylcholine and VIP release. CCKB receptors mediate release of an inhibitory mediator, apparently nitric oxide, from postjunctional sites.", 
    "104": "We have recently demonstrated that androgenic/anabolic steroids modulate in vitro ligand binding to the benzodiazepine binding site(s) associated with the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex (Masonis and McCarthy, 1995). One androgenic/anabolic steroid in particular, stanozolol, appears to stabilize the GABAA receptor in a moderate-affinity state for benzodiazepine binding. In the present study, we demonstrate the effects of stanozolol on the functional responsiveness of the GABAA receptor. After pre-incubation with stanozolol, we observed a decrease in the Emax and EC50 values for GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into cortical synaptoneurosomes. Moreover, in the presence of stanozolol, flunitrazepam-enhanced GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx was lost, and the GABAA receptor was stabilized in a functional state that was resistant to further desensitization by agonist. Stanozolol does not appear to reduce GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx by acting as a channel blocker at the well-characterized channel blocker binding site, as illustrated by the GABA-sensitive biphasic effects of stanozolol on [35S] t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding. These results demonstrate a novel, nongenomic mechanism for androgenic/anabolic steroidal modulation of CNS function.", 
    "105": "The joint, but not independent, activation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors induces liberation of arachidonic acid from cultured mouse striatal neurones. We examined whether blocking AMPA receptor desensitisation with cyclothiazide would modify this response. Cyclothiazide strongly potentiated the combined AMPA/(1 S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD)-evoked release of arachidonic acid (EC50 of approximately 7 microM) but did not modulate the basal, ACPD, or NMDA response. The enhanced liberation of arachidonic acid, observed in the presence of cyclothiazide, was due to the appearance of a genuine AMPA response that was independent of an associative activation of metabotropic receptors. The potentiated and nonpotentiated AMPA responses were inhibited by both competitive [2,3-di-hydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo (f) quinoxaline] and 2,3-benzodiazepine noncompetitive (GYKI 53655 and GYKI 52466) receptor antagonists. Cyclothiazide was equally effective at potentiating the AMPA response in either the presence or absence of glucose, suggesting that the increased glutamate-evoked arachidonic acid release observed in these cells under conditions of glucose deprivation is not due to reduced AMPA receptor desensitisation. The enhanced liberation of arachidonic acid measured in the presence of cyclothiazide appeared to result from a large (fourfold) elevation of the AMPA-induced increase in intracellular calcium level. Therefore, an AMPA-evoked mobilisation of arachidonic acid could potentially contribute to non-NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity, which has been observed in neuronal cells in the presence of cyclothiazide.", 
    "106": "The growth cone is responsible for axonal elongation and pathfinding by responding to various modulators for neurite growth, including neurotransmitters, although the sensor mechanisms are not fully understood. Among neurotransmitters, GABA is most likely to demonstrate activity in vivo because GABA and the GABAA receptor appear even in early stages of CNS development. We investigated the GABAA receptor-mediated signaling pathway in the growth cone using isolated growth cones (IGCs). Both the GABAA binding site and the benzodiazepine modulatory site were enriched in the growth cone membrane. In the intact IGC, GABA induced picrotoxin-sensitive Cl- flux (not influx but efflux) and increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a picrotoxin- and verapamil-sensitive manner. Protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation of two proteins identified as GAP-43 and MARCKS protein was enhanced in the intact IGC stimulated by GABA, resulting in the release of MARCKS protein and GAP-43 from the membrane. Collectively, our results suggest the following scheme: activation of the functional GABAA receptor localized in the growth cone membrane-->Cl- efflux induction through the GABAA-associated Cl- channel-->Ca2+ influx through an L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel-->Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation of GAP-43 and MARCKS protein by PKC.",

In general, A. salina 24-h old was less sensitive to these organophosphorous insecticides (OPI) than A. salina 48-h old and A. salina 48-h old was significantly more tolerant than A. salina 72-h old, in contrast, chlorpyrifos was equally toxic to A. salina 48- and 72-h old. There were some differences among the three age classes of A. salina in the relative order of toxicity of OPI tested. The rank order of toxicity to A. salina 48-h old was methylparathion < parathion < methyl-chlorpyrifos < chlorpyrifos, while to A. salina 24- and 72-h old it was methylparathion = parathion < methyl-chlorpyrifos < chlorpyrifos. The protective effect of the cholinergic antagonists atropine, hexamethonium, pirenzepine and 11-(2-((diethyl-amino)methyl)-1-piperidinylacetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)-(1,4)-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) and a cholinesterase-reactivating oxime 2-pyridine aldoxime methochloride (2-PAM) on the mortality due to four selected OPI in Artemia salina 24-h old was investigated. The lethal action of OPI tested was completely prevented by pretreatment of Artemia salina 24-h old with 2-PAM (10(-5) M) and atropine (10(-4 )M). However no concentration of hexamethonium, pirenzepine or AF-DX 116 protected 100% of the animals poisoned by LC84 of the OPI selected, maximum protection obtained was 71 to 88%. In contrast, the maximum inhibition of mortality obtained with AF-DX 116 pretreatment was about 55% because this compound was used at concentrations which were non toxic to control Artemia salina. Atropine, hexamethonium, pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and 2-PAM afforded 50 % protection (IC50) of Artemia salina against mortality by LC84 of the OPI selected at concentrations in the range of 6.62x10(-7)-1.6x10(-6) M, 2. 38x10(-4)-2.05x10(-3)M, 8.91x10(-7)-1.24x10(-6) M, 9.66x10(-8)-1. 34x10(-7 )M, and 1.95x10(-8)-2.73x10(-8 )M, respectively. Pretreatment of atropine plus 2-PAM to determine whether this combination afforded greater inhibition of the lethality induced by four OPI tested than pretreatment with either atropine or 2-PAM alone was investigated. Atropine (10(-5) M) in combination with 2-PAM (10(-7 )M) inhibited completely the acute toxicity of all OPI tested, while the pretreatment with atropine (10(-6) M) plus 2-PAM at the same concentration gave a inhibition of mortality (about 62%) significantly greater than each antagonist alone (about 14 and 46%, respectively).", 
    "109": "Propofol is formulated in an emulsion similar to 10% Intralipid, and several authors have suggested that fat accumulates during its infusion. In this study we used indirect calorimetry to measure lipid metabolism during abdominal surgery in patients anesthetized with propofol, using midazolam as a control. Thirty patients were randomly divided into three groups: Group P (propofol 2 mg/kg + 5 mg.kg-1.h-1, n = 13); Group M (midazolam, n = 9), and Group I (midazolam + 10% Intralipid at rates similar to those infused in Group P, n = 8). They were monitored with an indirect calorimeter for 90 min. Data including oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2), energy expenditure (EE), respiratory quotient (RQ), and lipid utilization were obtained every 15 min. VO2 increased in all groups at 45 min in respect to basal measurements with no differences between them. VCO2 decreased significantly only in Groups P and I, although no differences between the three groups were observed. EE did not vary in any of the groups. RQ decreased in all groups at 30 min, being significantly higher in Group M than in Groups P and I. Lipid oxidation increased in all groups from the beginning of the study reaching a plateau at 45 min. The lipid oxidation was higher in Groups P and I than in Group M, and coincided (80-100 g/24 h) with the amount of fat administered exogenously (85.4 g/ 24 h for a patient of 70 kg). Compared to VO2, VCO2, and EE, propofol behaves as other anesthetics. The fat administered in its formulation is metabolized in a preferential way, although it is likely that larger doses than those studied in our patients partially accumulate.", 
    "110": "After administration of doses ranging from 0.025 to 0.25 mg/kg, the neuromuscular blocking effect of cisatracurium was assessed in 119 adult surgical patients receiving N2O-opioid-midazolam-thiopental anesthesia. The calculated 95% effective dose (ED95) for inhibition of adductor pollicis twitch evoked at 0.1 Hz was 0.053 mg/kg. With 0.10 mg/kg injected over 5-10 and 20-30 s, median onset times (range) were 5.8 (3.0-7.7) and 4.8 (1.2-10.2) min, respectively, and median times to 5% and 95% recovery (range) were 27 (19-46) and 48 (25-68) min, respectively. For doses of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.25 mg/kg, median 5%-95% and 25%-75% recovery indexes ranged from 48 to 90 min and 8 to 9 min, respectively. After administration of neostigmine (0.06 mg/kg) at 10%-15% or 16%-30% recovery, the median times to 95% recovery (range) were 6 (2-22) and 4 (2-5) min, respectively. There were no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or plasma histamine concentrations during the first 5 min after administration of cisatracurium at doses up to 5 x ED95 injected over 5-10 s. No cutaneous flushing or bronchospasm was noted. In summary, cisatracurium is a potent neuromuscular blocking drug with an intermediate duration of action, characterized by excellent cardiovascular stability, with no apparent histamine release.", 
    "111": "The utility of clonidine for hypertensive patients presenting for major vascular procedures remains debatable. Twenty-one hypertensive patients presenting for aortic surgery were given clonidine (n = 11) or placebo (n = 10) in a double-blind, randomized manner. Clonidine was administered 6 micrograms/kg per os 120 min before induction of anesthesia and 3 micrograms/kg intravenously (i.v.) over 60 min from aortic declamping to skin closure. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil 20 micrograms/kg, midazolam, and atracurium and maintained with nitrous oxide 70%, an alfentanil infusion (0.25 microgram.kg-1. min-1), and isoflurane. Anesthetic requirements, circulatory variables, interventions, and isoproterenol dose-response curves (pre- and postoperatively) were determined. Plasma concentrations of clonidine, alfentanil, and vasoactive hormones were measured. When the clonidine group was compared with the placebo group, (a) isoflurane, alfentanil, and midazolam requirements were reduced by 38%, 42%, and 41%, respectively (P = 0.04, 0.03, 0.0002, respectively); (b) supplemental circulatory and anesthetic adjustments were reduced by 51% (P = 0.0006); (c) interventions with vasopressors were not significantly increased (placebo: two; clonidine: five); (d) systolic and mean arterial pressures and heart rate were reduced; (e) increases in norepinephrine, epinephrine, and plasma renin activity were suppressed, whereas vasopressin surge was attenuated; and (f) chronotropic response to isoproterenol was unaffected. Clonidine was effective in reducing anesthetic requirements and in improving circulatory stability in hypertensive patients presenting for major vascular procedures.",

Surprisingly, an antiepileptic effect for the BZR antagonist, flumazenil, has also been described, the mechanism of which is unknown. We investigated the effects of nanomolar concentrations of flumazenil and a structurally dissimilar BZR antagonist, propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCP), on normal synaptic responses and epileptiform discharges induced by a variety of methods in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices.", 
    "113": "Extracellular field potentials were recorded from stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region. Orthodromic stimulation was delivered by a bipolar electrode placed in the stratum radiatum at the border of the CA2/CA3 regions. Drugs were bath applied, and epileptiform discharges were quantified by using the Coastline Bursting Index, which calculates the total length of the discharge waveform of evoked multiple population spikes. For statistical comparisons, we calculated the Coastline Bursting Index for the average of five traces at the end of the control period (20 min), drug application (20 min), and washout (20-40 min).",

    "118": "There were significant differences in the clinical findings between the two cases. In the first case, movements were very pronounced and the patient was in oculogyric crisis. Movements in the second case were quite subtle but nonetheless problematic for the patient. In each case, discontinuation of GBP led to rapid resolution of the movements, although a single dose of lorazepam was used in the first case.", 
    "119": "Although formal electrophysiologic studies have not been performed, the movements associated with GBP use appear to be dystonic or myoclonic. Discontinuation of GBP led to rapid resolution of the movements. In severe cases, as in patients with oculogyric crisis, small doses of a benzodiazepine (BZD) appear to be efficacious and safe.", 
    "120": "The combination of West syndrome (WS) and Down syndrome appears not to be coincidental. Fourteen patients free of cardiac malformation or history of perinatal hypoxia were referred and investigated before they had received any treatment and were followed to the mean age of 4.5 years (range 19 months to 14 years). Spasms had onset at the mean age of 8 months (range 4-18 months) in cluster and were symmetrical. Hypsarrhythmia was symmetrical and, after intravenous diazepam (4 patients, 0.5 mg/kg) it disappeared, without any remaining focus. Recorded spasms during a cluster were \"independent,\" with recurrence of hypsarrhythmia between successive spasms, and thus had the ictal and interictal EEG characteristics of idiopathic WS. Seven patients exhibited other types of seizures after WS, consisting of myoclonic jerks, atonic, tonic-clonic or absence seizures, which proved quite easy to control with valproate and/or ethosuximide.", 
    "121": "Iodine-123 labelled iomazenil (IMZ) is a specific tracer for the GABAA receptor, the dominant inhibitory synapse of the brain. The cerebral distribution volume (Vd) of IMZ may be taken as a quantitative measure of these synapses in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where synaptic loss tends indiscriminately to affect all cortical neurons, albeit more so in some areas than in others. In this pilot study we measured Vd in six patients with probable AD and in five age-matched controls using a brain-dedicated single-photon emission tomography scanner allowing all cortical levels to be sampled simultaneously. Reduced values were found in all regions except in the occipital (visual) cortex. In particular, temporal and parietal cortex Vd was significantly (P<0.02) reduced: temporal Vd averaged 69 ml/ml in normals and 51 ml/ml in AD, and parietal Vd averaged 71 ml/ml in normals and 48 ml/ml in AD. These results accord well with emission tomographic studies of blood flow or labelled glucose. This supports the idea that while only measuring a subpopulation of synapses, the IMZ method reflects synaptic loss and hence functional loss in AD. The method constitutes an in vivo version of synaptic quantitation that in histopathological studies has been shown to correlate closely with the mental deterioration in AD.", 
    "122": "The aim of the study was to describe first time users of benzodiazepines and to analyze the extent of benzodiazepine prescriptions the following four years. Benzodiazepine prescriptions were issued to 2262 persons in Svendborg during the period February-March 1990 (Study-base: Inhabitants in Svendborg in 1990: n = 40,868). The incidence of first time users was 10 per 1000 person-years. Ninety percent of first time users seemed to be psychologically healthy persons. The most frequent indications were anxiety (1/3), insomnia (1/3), or crisis (1/4). After four years 98% of first time users had ceased their use of benzodiazepines. Most of the patients ceased benzodiazepine medication on their own initiative. The doctor stopped the medication in 11% of the cases. The risk of a \"repeat prescription syndrome\" in continuation of the first prescription of a benzodiazepine seemed to be negligible among psychologically healthy persons.", 
    "123": "Weight gain is one of the more common side effects of psychotropic drugs (neuroleptics, antidepressants, lithium, benzodiazepines). This effect depends on the type of drug, doses and length of treatment. It appears gradually and seems linked to the patient's clinical history. Among neuroleptics, phenothiazines and benzamides have the most important effect on weight. Weight gain with lithium is well documented and it does not regress with time. There is actually a controversy about antidepressants direct effects on weight. Current information concerning benzodiazepines is insufficient. Weight gain is not an unavoidable side effect and etiopathogenic mechanisms are not well known. Many hypothesis are discussed (biochemical, pharmacological, psychological and environmental). Weight gain is a complex and multifactorial phenomena.", 
    "124": "The observation that there are episodes of encephalopathy in liver cirrhosis patients after orthotopic liver transplantation, despite a well functioning graft and despite the lack of cerebral complications, prompted us to investigate the potential role of circulating benzodiazepine-like compounds in these episodes. The plasma levels of benzodiazepines were examined in 14 liver cirrhotic patients before and after transplantation. The benzodiazepines in the fluids infused during surgery and in individual bags of blood administered after surgery to 4 of these patients were also assayed. Herein we report that benzodiazepines accumulating in the blood of some transplanted patients appear to derive from blood transfusions utilized during surgery. The analysis of the types of benzodiazepines present in the blood utilized for transfusions suggests the use of commercial benzodiazepines by the donors. These compounds seem to be able to precipitate hepatic encephalopathy in patients with preexisting encephalopathy. Hence we suggest not using benzodiazepine consumers as blood donors, at least for patients with encephalopathy undergoing to liver transplantation.",

In rats, intravenously administered T-0632, L-364,718 and loxiglumide dose dependently inhibited cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion with estimated ED50 values of 0.025, 0.016 and 1.8 mg/kg, respectively. The ED50 values for intraduodenal administration of these compounds were 0.040, 0.26 and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively. In mice, orally administered T-0632 prevented caerulein-induced pancreatitis, CCK-8-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and CCK-8-induced gallbladder emptying in dose-dependent manners with ED50 values of 0.028, 0.04, and 0.12 mg/kg, respectively. The effect of T-0632 for caerulein-induced pancreatitis was 4-fold more potent than that for gallbladder emptying. In contrast, the effects of L-364,718 and loxiglumide for caerulein-induced pancreatitis were 2-4-fold weaker than those for gallbladder emptying. In dogs, T-0632 and loxiglumide maximally inhibited CCK-8-stimulated pancreatic amylase secretion at doses of 0.01 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. At these doses, the effect of T-0632 on CCK-8-induced increase in the gallbladder intraluminal pressure was weaker than that of loxiglumide. These results suggest that T-0632 has a potent antagonistic action on CCKA receptors in several animal species and the effects of T-0632 are more selective for the pancreas over the gallbladder compared with L-364,718 and loxiglumide.", 
    "126": "This study uses immediate early transcription factor gene expression to map neuronal activation after a single exposure to the elevated X-maze. Exposure to this novel environment leads to widespread upregulation in the gene expression of c-fos, NGFI-A and NGFI-B (the nerve growth factor induced genes), but not c-jun nor jun B as shown by in situ hybridization and northern blot analysis. Changes in c-fos were evident after just 5 min exposure to the maze. The cholecystokininB receptor antagonist, CI-988, given intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg 40 min prior to exposure to the X-maze demonstrated an anxiolytic profile without affecting overall movement around the maze, however it did not reduce the increased levels of gene expression with the methodology used. Likewise the anxiolytic benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide at 3 mg/kg did not reduce gene expression. It is concluded that a reduction in an index of behavioural stress/anxiety produced by anxiolytic agents is not concomitantly followed by a detectable reduction in immediate early gene induction.", 
    "127": "Acute administration of diazepam (2 mg/kg i.p.) to rats decreased the number of head-dips, locomotor activity and the number of rears made in the holeboard apparatus, indicating sedative effects. After daily treatment for 7 days with diazepam (2 mg/kg) tolerance developed to all these behavioural effects, despite serum concentrations of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam significantly higher than those following acute treatment. After 7 drug-free recovery days the rats were quite unresponsive to a probe dose of diazepam (2 mg/kg) and although there was a gradual recovery of responsiveness to diazepam, the reduction in rears still did not reach the level of the acute group even after 21 drug-free days. There was evidence for pharmacokinetic changes when probe doses of diazepam were given after 7, 14 or 21 recovery days. Lower levels of diazepam and higher levels of N-desmethyldiazepam than following an acute dose to the drug-na\u00efve group were detected, indicating that the chronic treatment had resulted in a persistently enhanced rate of N-demethylation. It is argued that these changes do not fully account for the reduced responsiveness to the probe doses, and nor can they account for the gradual return of response over the 3-week recovery period. There were no detectable scrum concentrations of either compound 24 h after the end of the chronic treatment. However, no rebound increases in behavioural responses were detected at any time-point in withdrawal. Thus, the mechanism underlying this behavioural tolerance was not oppositional in nature. It is suggested that a situation-independent learned behavioural strategy is the most likely mechanism for the observed tolerance.", 
    "128": "The present study investigated dose dependence and time course effects of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) partial inverse agonist, RO19-4603 (0.005-0.30 mg/kg) alone, and in combination with the BDZ receptor antagonists flumazenil, ZK 93426, and CGS 8216 (20 mg/kg) in selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) rats provided a two-bottle choice test between ethanol (EtOH) (10% v/v), and a palatable saccharin (0.0125% g/v) solution. A single dose of RO19-4603 as low as 0.009 mg/kg selectively reduced EtOH drinking during the initial 15 min of a 4 h access to 19-0% of control levels on day 1. The 0.08, 0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg doses of RO19-4603 significantly reduced total EtOH intake in the 4 h access period to 57-45% of controls on day 1. On day 2, no RO19-4603 injections were given; however, six of the seven doses of RO19-4603 (0.009, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.15, and 0.30 mg/kg) continued to reduce EtOH intake to 42-3% of control levels at the initial 15 min interval, while the 0.005, 0.009, 0.08, and 0.30 mg/kg doses reduced total 4 h EtOH intake to 60-42% of controls. Saccharin intake was either not altered by RO19-4603 or showed increases during the initial 15 min intervals and the total 4 h sessions on days 1 and 2. Food intake was also unaffected by RO19-4603. The CGS 8216, but neither flumazenil nor ZK 93426, reliably reversed the RO19-4603-induced suppression of EtOH intake on days 1 and 2. That certain BDZ inverse agonists can attenuate motivated behavior for EtOH reinforcement over a prolonged time course may provide a possible therapeutic approach to reducing EtOH consumption associated with alcoholism.", 
    "129": "The existence of possible relationships among the developmental profile of various cholinergic markers in the main olfactory bulb (OB) was assessed by using in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Muscarinic receptors were visualized with [3H]pirenzepine (muscarinic M1-like sites) and [3H]AF-DX 384 (muscarinic M2-like sites); nicotinic receptors by using [3H]cytisine (nicotinic 42-like subtype) and [125I] alpha-bungarotoxin (nicotinic 7-like subtype); cholinergic nerve terminals by using [3H]vesamicol (vesicular acetylcholine transport sites) and [3H]hemicholinium-3 (high-affinity choline uptake sites). These various cholinergic markers exhibited their lowest levels at birth and reached adult values by the end of the 4-5 postnatal weeks. However, the density of presynaptic cholinergic markers and nicotinic receptors at postnatal day 2 represented a large proportion of the levels observed in adulthood, and displays a transient overexpression around postnatal day 20. In contrast, the postnatal development of cholinergic muscarinic M1-like and M2-like receptors is apparently regulated independently of the presynaptic cholinergic markers and nicotinic receptors. Two neurochemically and anatomically separate olfactory glomeruli subsets were observed in the posterior OB of the developing rat. These atypical glomeruli expressed large amounts of [3H]vesamicol-and [3H]hemicholinium binding sites without significant amounts of muscarinic M1, M2, or nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptor binding sites. A significant density of [125I] alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites could be detected only at early postnatal ages. A few olfactory glomeruli specifically restricted to the dorsal posterior OB expressed a high density of [3H]cytisine binding sites but lacked significant binding of the two presynaptic cholinergic markers used here, suggesting their noncholinergic but cholinoceptive nature.", 
    "130": "The effects of the dye Evans Blue and GYKI 52466, a 2,3-benzodiazepine, on (S)- alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptors in primary cultured rat cortical neurons were investigated using the patch-clamp technique. Evans Blue and GYKI 52466 reduced the currents induced by the application of 100 microM kainate with IC50 values of 10.6 +/- 1.4 microM and 12.1 +/- 0.4 microM, respectively. In contrast to the similar potencies of the two compounds, their kinetics of block were quite different with those of Evans Blue being more complex. The on-, as well as the off-reaction of the block by GYKI 52466 could be described by single exponential functions, whereas two different time-constants for binding and one time-constant for the unbinding of Evans Blue were found. The block of AMPA receptors by Evans Blue was not completely reversible under the experimental conditions applied in this study. GYKI 52466 was not able to augment the recovery after inhibiting AMPA receptors with Evans Blue. Moreover, preapplication of a high concentration of GYKI 52466 did not prevent the inhibition of AMPA receptors by Evans Blue. We therefore conclude that GYKI 52466 and Evans Blue bind to two different sites at AMPA receptors in primary cultured cortical neurons.",

    "136": "It has been proposed that in normal animal cells, biosynthesis of the heme precursor protoporphyrin IX (Proto) requires cooperation between the mitochondria and cytoplasm [S. Granick (1967) in Biochemistry of the Chloroplast (Goodwin, T. W., Ed.), pp. 373-410, Academic Press, NY]. In this work, the conversion of ALA to Coprogen in the cytoplasm of MLA 144 cells (a retrovirally transformed gibbon ape leukemic T cell line) is demonstrated. This in turn indicates that the intracellular localization of Coprogen biosynthesis in transformed animal cells is similar to that proposed for normal animal cells. It is also shown that in MLA 144 cells, after ALA conversion to Coprogen in the cytoplasm, Coprogen is transported into the mitochondria via an ATP-dependent process. The possible involvement of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (M-PBR) in Coprogen transport into mitochondria is discussed.", 
    "137": "A brief exposure to high concentrations of glutamate kills cultured forebrain neurons by an excitotoxic process that is dependent on Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor. In this study, we have measured striking changes in mitochondrial function during and immediately after intense glutamate receptor activation. Using indo-1 microfluorometry and a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, CGP-37157, we have demonstrated that mitochondria accumulate large quantities of Ca2+ during a toxic glutamate stimulus and further that Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria contributes to the prolonged [Ca2+]i elevation after glutamate removal. We then used JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine+ ++ iodide), a ratiometric indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi), to show that Ca2+ accumulation within the organelle dissipates delta psi. The abrupt loss of delta psi after glutamate stimulation did not occur in the presence of MK801 or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The mitochondrial depolarization was also cyclosporin A-sensitive, indicating a probable role for the permeability transition pore. Hence mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and the subsequent permeability transition may be a critical early event specific to the NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxic cascade.", 
    "138": "The release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the dorsal hippocampus was measured using an in vivo microdialysis method in rats subjected to the Vogel type conflict test. The conflict situation significantly increased 5-HT release in the dorsal hippocampus. Midazolam (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed the dosage-dependently this increased 5-HT release, an inhibition closely associated with the attenuation of conflict behavior. These findings suggest that the activation of serotonergic neuronal activity in the dorsal hippocampus is linked to mediation of anxiety-related behavior.", 
    "139": "Glutamate antagonists to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors blocks the development of \"rapid' tolerance to the sedative action of benzodiazepines (BZDs). This kind of glutamate receptors is closely related to synaptic plasticity in different areas of the brain such as hippocampus. In the present investigation, we studied the synaptic plasticity in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus during the development of tolerance to the hypomotility action induced by diazepam (DZ). The results show an increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity in slices from rats treated with diazepam (5 mg/kg per day) during 4 days, assessed as a decrease of the threshold in the stimulation frequency for long-term potentiation (LTP) elicitation. Thus, a single dose of DZ does not change the ease of induction of LTP but does change locomotor behavior: multiple DZ doses change LTP but not locomotor behavior. Our results reveal a positive correlation between the synaptic plasticity and development of BZD tolerance to locomotor activity.",

Compounds within the imidazo[1,5-alpha]quinoxaline urea series had high affinity for the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex with varying in vitro efficacy, although most analogs were partial agonists as indicated by [35S]TBPS and Cl- current ratios. Interestingly, a subseries of piperazine ureas was identified which had biphasic efficacy, becoming more antagonistic with increasing concentration. Analogs within the imidazo[1,5-alpha]quinoxalin-4-one series had substantially decreased binding affinity as compared to the quinoxaline urea series. These compounds ranged from antagonists to full agonists by in vitro analysis, with several derivatives having roughly 4-fold greater intrinsic activity than diazepam as indicated by Cl- current measurement. Numerous compounds from both series were effective in antagonizing metrazole-induced seizures, consistent with anti-convulsant properties and possible anxiolytic activity.

To study the mechanism of action of N3-phenacyluridine, the interaction of this compound with the benzodiazepine receptor has been investigated. Results obtained showed that this compound inhibited specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to synaptic membranes of bovine cortex in a concentration-dependent fashion (IC50 = 129 microM). Scatchard analysis of [3H]flunitrazepam binding revealed that N3-phenacyluridine interacted with the ligand at the benzodiazepine receptor binding site in a competitive manner. Ro15-1788 (8-fluoro-3-carboethoxy-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a ]1, 4-benzodiazepine), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, also inhibited the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the presence of the compound.

    "142": "Panic disorder is becoming better recognised and understood as a chronic, debilitating but treatable condition. Drug treatment options shown by adequate research to be beneficial in this condition include mainly the benzodiazepine alprazolam, the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) imipramine and clomipramine, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine, and the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Alprazolam, although approved for use in panic disorder in the US and very widely used, is associated with a risk of dependence and withdrawal syndromes. Given that depression frequently occurs as a comorbid condition with panic disorder the use of antidepressants is a logical choice. Among the antidepressants, MAOIs are little-used in panic disorder, mainly because of their potential for precipitating hypertensive crises if tyramine is ingested. TCAs are widely used and are effective but they are associated with initial activation, or 'jitteriness', have a 4-6-week time lag before onset of beneficial effect and produce troublesome side effects in a high proportion of patients, particularly during long-term use. TCAs are also cardiotoxic in overdosage, and panic disorder patients with comorbid depression are at high risk of attempted suicide. Serotonin dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders in general, and panic disorder in particular. Among the TCAs, those with an effect on serotonin reuptake are most effective in panic disorder. SSRIs are specifically active on serotonin reuptake and do not have anticholinergic effects or act on the noradrenergic system. There is a clear pharmacological rationale for believing that SSRIs should be as effective as TCAs in panic disorder and better tolerated. Accumulating clinical research evidence supports this hypothesis. Further comparative studies with standard agents and additional long-term studies to support the initial long-term data with paroxetine are needed to confirm SSRIs as drug treatment of choice in panic disorder."
