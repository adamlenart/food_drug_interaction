    "21": "Bioreactors being developed for bioartificial liver devices vary greatly in their construction. Until now, primary liver cells were cultivated either in sandwich configuration, as spheroids, or in special hollow fiber systems. Primary hepatocytes are demanding on their environment and have a high oxygen consumption. To get good results, optimal cultivation conditions are needed. The idea of the project was to investigate a new concept of an oxygenating hollow fiber bioreactor (OXY-HFB). The OXY-HFB should consist exclusively of oxygenating and internal heat exchange fibers to yield a simple and effective design. Primary liver cells were seeded on the surface of the fibers in the extrafiber space. Oxygen requirements and temperature control were supplied through the fibers. The culture medium was perfused through the extrafiber space and therefore brought into direct hepatocellular contact. The OXY-HFB concept offers different advantages. A high cell density of 2.5 x 10(7) cells/mL can be obtained. This results in a cell number of 2.5 x 10(9) liver cells per bioreactor. Furthermore, the OXY-HFB is easily handled because no incubator is required. To study the efficiency of this bioreactor technique, various parameters were investigated over a cultivation period of three weeks. These included urea synthesis, lactate formation, glucose elimination, albumin synthesis, oxygen level, and pH. Furthermore, the metabolites of diazepam were measured. The biochemical performance of the bioreactor remained stable over the investigated time period. These results demonstrate that porcine liver cells preserve their viability and primary metabolism in the OXY-HFB over the complete period of study.",

    "26": "NMDA receptor hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and pharmacological and genetic approaches have been used to model such dysfunction. We previously have described two mouse lines carrying point mutations in the NMDA receptor glycine binding site, Grin1(D481N) and Grin1(K483Q), which exhibit 5- and 86-fold reductions in receptor glycine affinity, respectively. Grin1(D481N) animals exhibit a relatively mild phenotype compatible with a moderate reduction in NMDA receptor function, whereas Grin1(K483Q) animals die shortly after birth. In this study we have characterized compound heterozygote Grin1(D481N/K483Q) mice, which are viable and exhibited biphasic NMDA receptor glycine affinities compatible with the presence of each of the two mutated alleles. Grin1(D481N/K483Q) mice exhibited a marked NMDA receptor hypofunction revealed by deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation, which were rescued by the glycine site agonist d-serine, which also facilitated NMDA synaptic currents in mutant, but not in wild-type, mice. Analysis of striatal monoamine levels revealed an apparent dopaminergic and serotonergic hyperfunction. Behaviorally, Grin1(D481N/K483Q) mice were insensitive to acute dizocilpine pretreatment and exhibited increased startle response but normal prepulse inhibition. Most strikingly, mutant mice exhibited a sustained, nonhabituating hyperactivity and increased stereotyped behavior that were resistant to suppression by antipsychotics and the benzodiazepine site agonist Zolpidem. They also displayed a disruption of nest building behavior and were unable to perform a cued learning paradigm in the Morris water maze. We speculate that the severity of NMDA receptor hypofunction in these mice may account for their profound behavioral phenotype and insensitivity to antipsychotics.",

    "31": "Classical screening tests (maximal electroshock, MES, and threshold pentylenetetrazol, PTZ) employ non-epileptic rodents and identify antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with mechanisms of action associated with significant CNS side effects. Thus MES identifies drugs acting on Na+ channels that produce cerebellar toxicity. It may be possible to produce novel AEDs more selectively targeted at voltage-sensitive (VS) ion channels. There is little specific evidence for the likely success of this strategy with subunit selective agents targeted at the different VS Na+ channels. Drugs targeted at specific VS Ca++ channels (T, N, P/Q types) may be useful in generalised seizures. There are many as yet unexplored possibilities relating to K+ channels. GABA related drugs acting on PTZ clonic seizures tend to induce sedation and muscle hypotonia. Studies in mice, particularly with knock-in mutations, but also with subunit selective agents acting via the GABA(A) benzodiazepine site, suggest that it is possible to produce agents which do or do not induce particular side effects (sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, amnesia, anaesthesia). Whether these findings transfer to man has yet to be established. Acquired epilepsy in rodents (e.g. kindling or spontaneous seizures following chemically- or electrically-induced status epilepticus) or acquired epilepsy in man (following prolonged febrile seizures or traumatic brain injury) is associated with multiple changes in the function and subunit composition of ion channels and receptor molecules. Optimal screening of novel AEDs, both for efficacy and side effects, requires models with receptor and ion channel changes similar to those in the target human syndrome.", 
    "32": "Little is known regarding the functional processes underlying the treatment efficacy of antidepressant drugs. Given the close association between stress, anxiety and depression, distinguishing the common and disparate features of these processes may contribute to our current understanding. Using the olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rat, an animal model sensitive to a variety of antidepressant drugs, this study examined the effects of chronic fluoxetine administration on open-field behavior under different conditions of stressfulness (luminance) and compared the fluoxetine effects to those evoked by the anxiolytic lorazepam. Sham-operated and OBX rats received 21 daily injections of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), one or seven injections of lorazepam (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to testing in the open field or plus maze. Time series data were collected and fit with exponential regression models to estimate behavioral reactivity, habituation and residual rate of responding. Relative to sham controls, OBX rats displayed increased locomotor activity in the high luminance open field but showed decreased activity in the lower luminance open field. Time series analysis revealed that while sham animals showed increased habituation in the high compared to lower luminance open field, OBX rats did not significantly modify their responding between the two conditions. Chronic fluoxetine treatment invoked rectifying effects in OBX animals only in the high luminance open field by increasing the rate of habituation. Both acute and subchronic administration of lorazepam also reduced OBX hyperactivity but did so only by decreasing the residual rate of responding. As expected, lorazepam administration significantly increased the ratio of open-to-total arm activity in the elevated plus maze. These findings suggest that OBX responding in the open field may be maladaptive, reflecting an inability to modify behavior appropriately in certain environmental contexts. Chronic antidepressant treatment enhances habituation of OBX animals only under more stressful or aversive conditions and appears to do so in a manner temporally distinct from anxiolytic treatment.", 
    "33": "The hippocampus has a critical role in several fundamental memory operations, including the conditioning of fear to contextual information. We show that the hippocampus is necessary also for unconditioned fear, and that the involved circuitry is at the ventral pole of the hippocampus. Rats with selective hippocampal lesions failed to avoid open arms in an elevated plus-maze and had decreased neuroendocrine stress responses during confinement to a brightly lit chamber. These effects were reproduced by lesions of the ventral half of the hippocampus, but not by damage to the dorsal three-quarters of the hippocampus or the amygdala. Ventral lesions failed to impair contextual fear conditioning or spatial navigation, suggesting that the ventral hippocampus may specifically influence some types of defensive fear-related behavior.",

However, many other sedative molecules can be used to obtain chemical submission.

    "35": "For young people experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia, the first and most important matter to be attended to, once the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been made and patients have entered the care system, is to establish a treatment alliance. The next step is to conceive an individually tailored treatment programme (non-pharmacological as well as pharmacological). The use of antipsychotic drugs needs to be carefully discussed with both patients and families, as medication tends to have a poor public perception. Maintaining treatment is vitally important in terms of relapse prevention, but people who suffer a first-episode tend to terminate treatment early. Patients often discontinue their medication because of side-effects, although a number of other factors can also exert a negative influence on the continuous intake of medication. Among others, these include insufficient information provided to patients and significant others as well as lack of insight and problems in the doctor-patient-relationship. The published data indicate that the outcome of treatment is better for younger patients in a first-episode of schizophrenia than it is for patients who are more chronically ill. However, young patients are much more sensitive to compliance problems than older patients. The main challenge in this phase of the illness is therefore to convince patients that maintenance treatment is necessary in order to assure the best possible outcome.",

Apart from the application of premedication drugs, a strongly committed anaesthetist and sound psychological work are decisive prerequisites for adequate premedication. In this randomized study, 329 children aged between 1 and 14 who were scheduled for small surgical procedures were examined. Based on the results of a preliminary trial using different dosages of midazolam, the children were premedicated either orally with 0.4 mg/kg BW midazolam or with 0.3 mg/kg BW midazolam as a rectal solution and the premedication effect was recorded according to the classification of Lindgren. These reduced doses of midazolam, which were much lower than those described in the literature, led to very good premedication effects, too. Regarding cardiovascular behaviour, an increasing anxiolysis and the effect of premedication led to a significant decline in mean arterial blood pressure and heart frequency. The circulatory changes that occurred were at no time clinically relevant in any child, and therefore no treatment was needed. Based on the measured oxygen saturation, no significant respiratory changes were seen during the observation period. The frequency and extent of the registered side-effects were classified as slight. Side-effects such as singultus, salivation and ataxia/gesticulations were of no danger during the entire perioperative period.", 
    "42": "In rats, exposure to diazepam (DZ) during the last week of gestation is associated with behavioral alterations (in some cases sexually dimorphic) that appear when the animals reach adulthood. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of prenatal DZ exposure on the function of the gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)(A) receptor complex. The method used - perfusion of rat hippocampal nerve terminals labeled with [3H]noradrenaline (NA) - allowed us to evaluate the effects of DZ on a specific native GABA(A) receptor subtype which is located on hippocampal noradrenergic nerve endings and mediates the release of NA. Muscimol stimulated synaptosomal release of [3H]NA in a concentration-dependent manner; maximal stimulation (50%) was achieved with a concentration of 30 microM, and the ED(50) was 1.7 microM. The effect of muscimol was potentiated by the positive allosteric modulators DZ and 3alpha-pregnan-5alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-P; allopregnanolone), which displayed similar maximal effects and affinities. In the presence of DZ (0.1 microM), muscimol stimulated the release of [3H]NA with an ED(50) of 0.5 microM; in the presence of 3alpha,5alpha-P (0.1 microM), the ED(50) of muscimol was 0.3 microM. Prenatal DZ exposure did not modify the concentration-effect curve for muscimol, but it did abolish the potentiating effects of DZ and 3alpha,5alpha-P. These findings demonstrate that prenatal exposure to DZ produces functional modifications of the GABA(A) receptor subtype we investigated. This effect may be related to the relative contributions of the various protein subunits that compose the GABA(A) receptor complex. Exposure to DZ while the GABA(A) receptors are developing might influence the expression of these subunits, giving rise to a receptor that can be activated by muscimol but is not susceptible to allosteric modulation by DZ or 3alpha,5alpha-P.", 
    "43": "1: The pharmacology of the stable cell line expressing human alpha(4)beta(3)delta GABA(A) receptor was investigated using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. 2: alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptors exhibited increased sensitivity to GABA when compared to alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors, with EC(50)'s of 0.50 (0.46, 0.53) microM and 2.6 (2.5, 2.6) microM respectively. Additionally, the GABA partial agonists piperidine-4-sulphonate (P4S) and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisothiazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) displayed markedly higher efficacy at alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptors, indeed THIP demonstrated greater efficacy than GABA at these receptors. 3: The delta subunit conferred slow desensitization to GABA, with rate constants of 4.8+/-0.5 s for alpha(4)beta(3)delta and 2.5+/-0.2 s for alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2). However, both P4S and THIP demonstrated similar levels of desensitization on both receptor subtypes suggesting this effect is agonist specific. 4: alpha(4)beta(3)delta and alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) demonstrated equal sensitivity to inhibition by the cation zinc (2-3 microM IC(50)). However, alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptors demonstrated greater sensitivity to inhibition by lanthanum. The IC(50) for GABA antagonists SR-95531 and picrotoxin, was similar for alpha(4)beta(3)delta and alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2). Likewise, inhibition was observed on both subtypes at high and low pH. 5: alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptors were insensitive to modulation by benzodiazepine ligands. In contrast Ro15-4513 and bretazenil potentiated GABA responses on alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) cells, and the inverse agonist DMCM showed allosteric inhibition of alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors. 6: The efficacy of neurosteroids at alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptors was greatly enhanced over that observed at alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors. The greatest effect was observed using THDOC with 524+/-71.6% potentiation at alpha(4)beta(3)delta and 297.9+/-49.7% at alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors. Inhibition by the steroid pregnenolone sulphate however, showed no subtype selectivity. The efficacy of both pentobarbitone and propofol was slightly augmented and etomidate greatly enhanced at alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptors versus alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors. 7: We show that the alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptor has a distinct pharmacology and kinetic profile. With its restricted distribution within the brain and unique pharmacology this receptor may play an important role in the action of neurosteroids and anaesthetics.

During a simulated EMS scene call, 72 healthy male volunteers were either transported by paramedics from a third-floor apartment through a staircase with subsequent EMS transport with sirens (three stress groups of n = 12; total, n = 36) or asked to sit on a chair for 5 min and lie down on a stretcher for 15 min (three control groups of n = 12; total, n = 36). Catecholamine plasma samples were measured in the respective stress and control groups at baseline and after placebo IV (n = 12) or 25 (n = 12) or 50 (n = 12) microg/kg of midazolam IV throughout the experiment, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance; P < 0.05 was considered significant. The Placebo Stress versus Control group, but not the 50 microg/kg Stress Midazolam group, had both significantly increased epinephrine (73 +/- 5 pg/mL versus 45 +/- 5 pg/mL; P < 0.001) and norepinephrine (398 +/- 34 pg/mL versus 278 +/- 23 pg/mL; P < 0.01) plasma levels after staircase transport.

    "46": "Gene expression changes induced by general anesthetics have not been extensively examined. In this investigation, we treated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells with IV anesthetics, and assessed expression of immediate early gene products, c-Fos and EGR-1, by immunoblot analysis. Thiopental, ketamine, propofol, and diazepam did not significantly change the expression level of c-Fos and EGR-1. In contrast, midazolam dose- and time-dependently induced expression of c-Fos and EGR-1, which was not affected by antagonists of the benzodiazepine receptors, flumazenil and PK11195. The midazolam-induced c-Fos and EGR-1 expression was abolished by PD98059, an inhibitor for mitogen- activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, suggesting the involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that midazolam induces phosphorylation and activation of ERKs. These results indicate that midazolam induces the expression of c-Fos and EGR-1, by activation of ERKs through a mechanism independent from gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors, in PC12 cells, and suggest the possibility that midazolam can induce long-term changes of neural functions by changing gene expression.",

Oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg, maximum dose of 20 mg) or oral diazepam (0.3 mg/kg, maximum dose of 10 mg) was given before IV insertion, and with IV meperidine (2 mg/kg, maximum dose of 100 mg) given to all patients just before upper endoscopy. Further \"rescue\" midazolam doses (to a maximum cumulative dose of 5 mg) were given as needed to achieve a pre-procedure sedation score of > or =2. All patients received intravenous propofol for procedural sedation. Patients were evaluated for the efficacy and safety of pre-procedural sedation, sedation during upper endoscopy, and recovery following completion of the procedure.",

The patient recovered well without any clinically significant complications. A consequence of the close monitoring of paroxetine levels in this patient was that it was decided not to reintroduce any other antidepressant despite her suicide attempt, until normal levels of paroxetine had been reached, which took over 1 month.", 
    "61": "The authors report the use of the quantitative pharmaco-EEG (QPEEG) technique to study the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of clonazepam (CZP) in four epileptic children who suffered uncontrolled seizures despite long-term valproate (VPA) therapy. After a single dose of CZP (0.05 mg/kg, PO), blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, and 24.0 hours. CZP and VPA concentrations were measured by HPLC or GC assay, respectively. At each blood collection time point, EEG signals (60 s) were recorded for brain electrical activity mapping, and the power percentage average (PPA) of each frequency band was calculated. The relationship between drug concentrations and their corresponding PPA of each frequency band was analyzed. VPA steady-state drug concentrations (Css) were within the therapeutic range and not affected by CZP. The peak concentration (Cmax) of CZP and the time intervals from dosing to Cmax (Tmax) were 20.9 ng/mL to 113.8 ng/mL and 1 hour to 1.5 hours, respectively. There was no significant correlation between VPA concentrations and the PPA of any of the EEG frequency bands. CZP blood concentrations showed significant correlation with PPA in 3 of the 4 patients. Our results suggested CZP could affect fast wave activities in proportion to CZP blood concentrations. We propose that QPEEG is a promising technique to study the PK and PD of selected anti-epileptic drugs.", 
    "62": "Olanzapine (Zyprexa) was approved for general prescription in Sweden in November 1996, and an HPLC-based therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) routine for serum olanzapine (OLA) and its major metabolite, N-demethylolanzapine (DMO) was established in February 1997. During 1997 to 1999, a total of 753 TDM requests for a total of 545 Swedish patients was analyzed. Additional patient information on certain clinical variables was collected on specifically designed TDM request forms. After the exclusion process, samples from 194 patients were found to be eligible for further scrutiny. The concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio for OLA varied 25-fold and that of DMO 22-fold. Women had a higher (P < 0.01) median C/D ratio for OLA than men (median, 7.2 nmol/L/mg vs 5.2 nmol/L/mg). Nonsmokers had a higher (P < 0.001) C/D ratio for OLA than smokers (median, 9.2 nmol/L/mg vs 4.0 nmol/L/mg). Smokers got higher prescribed (P < 0.05) doses of OLA than nonsmokers did. In the group with reported side effects, the median serum OLA concentration was 22% higher (P < 0.05) than in the group without side effects. Patients co-medicated with carbamazepine had a 71% lower median C/D ratio for OLA than patients on OLA monotherapy. The present TDM-based follow-up suggests that the influence of gender, smoking habits, and certain drug interactions may need to be considered for optimal dosage of OLA. TDM may be used for this purpose more readily in the future.", 
    "63": "The influence of carbamazepine on the glucuronidation of the antipsychotic olanzapine was studied in a group of psychiatric patients. Steady-state serum concentrations of free and glucuronidated olanzapine were measured in 31 psychiatric patients in monotherapy (dose range, 2.5-30 mg/d; median, 15 mg/d) and in 16 patients being comedicated with carbamazepine (dose range, 5-50 mg/d; median, 20 mg/d). The concentrations were determined by HPLC with and without acid hydrolysis of glucuronidated olanzapine. For the monotherapy group, the concentrations of free and glucuronidated olanzapine ranged from 0 nmol/L to 292 nmol/L (median, 94 nmol/L) and from 0 nmol/L to 180 nmol/L (median, 27 nmol/L), respectively. The serum concentrations of the carbamazepine-treated group ranged from 21 nmol/L to 310 nmol/L (median, 81 nmol/L) and from 0 to 376 nmol/L (median, 57 nmol/L) for free and glucuronidated olanzapine, respectively. Two patients with outlying values were excluded from further analysis. The median concentration-to-daily dose ratios (C/D) of free and glucuronidated olanzapine in the monotherapy group were 5.8 nmol/L/mg and 2.2 nmol/L/mg, respectively (n =30). The corresponding values for the group comedicated with carbamazepine were 3.6 and 3.1 nmol/L/mg (n =15). Thus, the median C/D of free olanzapine in the carbamazepine group was 38% lower than that of the monotherapy group (P <0.01), confirming that carbamazepine accelerates the metabolism of olanzapine. Further, for the carbamazepine group the median glucuronidated olanzapine fraction constituted 79% of the free fraction compared with 43% for the monotherapy group (P <0.01), which suggests that an increased rate of olanzapine glucuronidation contributes to the increased rate of metabolism of olanzapine induced by carbamazepine.", 
    "64": "There is evidence of marked variation in the brain distribution of specific subtypes of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor and that particular subtypes mediate different functions. The alpha5-containing subtype is highly expressed in the hippocampus, and selective alpha5 inverse agonists (which decrease tonic GABA inhibition) are being developed as potential memory-enhancing agents. Evidence for such receptor localization and specialization in humans in vivo is lacking because the widely used probes for imaging the GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, [11C]flumazenil and [123I]iomazenil, appear to reflect binding to the alpha1 subtype, based on its distribution and affinity of flumazenil for this subtype. The authors characterized for positron emission tomography (PET) a radioligand from Ro15 4513, the binding of which has a marked limbic distribution in the rat and human brain in vivo. Competition studies in vivo in the rat revealed that radiolabeled Ro15 4513 uptake was reduced to nonspecific levels only by drugs that have affinity for the alpha5 subtype (flunitrazepam, RY80, Ro15 4513, L655,708), but not by the alpha1 selective agonist, zolpidem. Quantification of [11C]Ro15 4513 PET was performed in humans using a metabolite-corrected plasma input function. [11C]Ro15 4513 uptake was relatively greater in limbic areas compared with [11C]flumazenil, but lower in the occipital cortex and cerebellum. The authors conclude that [11C]Ro15 4513 PET labels in vivo the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor containing the alpha5 subtype in limbic structures and can be used to further explore the functional role of this subtype in humans.",

Because dying cancer patients and their families are often coping with new challenges daily, any intervention that can prevent further patient or family discomfort should be implemented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate four pharmacy interventions aimed at improving nursing care to cancer patients at a facility for the terminally ill. The four interventions were development of a seizure risk factor assessment toll, assembly or availability of a diazepam seizure kit, nursing education via in-service training, and development of a manual for nursing stations. Successful implementation of this project indicated that nurses perceived an empowerment in improving quality of life of their patients.", 
    "66": "Psychotropic medication-induced hyponatraemia is an uncommon but important clinical problem with potential serious consequences if not recognised and treated early. Several risk factors have been associated with the development of hyponatraemia. This article reviews reported cases of hyponatraemia associated with the use of psychotropic medications and evaluates possible risk factors and causes. The data were sourced by a search of Medline for reports of hyponatraemia associated with the use of psychotropic medication between January 1966 and December 2000 and a search of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) spontaneous reporting system database between January 1966 and December 1999. All the reports were included in this review. In the case reports the following data were assessed: age, gender, daily dosage, days to onset, days to recovery, medical condition, concurrent medications. Several risk factors were identified: advanced age, female gender, use of other medications, medical comorbidity. The risk of hyponatraemia was found to be higher during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Administration of the dosage of the drug was not found to be related to the development of hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia can cause confusion, agitation and lethargy. Any change in the course of illness should alert the physician to the possibility of hyponatraemia.",

Midazolam and succinylcholine were administered before laryngoscopy, and rocuronium was given after tube placement was confirmed by means of capnometry, syringe aspiration, and pulse oximetry. The Combitube was used as a salvage airway device. Outcome measures included intubation success rates, preintubation and postintubation oxygen saturation values, arrival arterial blood gas values, and total out-of-hospital times for patients intubated en route versus on scene.",

Analysis of results in terms of coping styles showed a significant long-term survival benefit of treatment in highly anxious men, for whom reductions in somatic symptoms of depression mediated program impact. However, the program was also associated with significantly worse survival in repressors of both sexes. By the end of the program, repressors in the treatment group were more likely to be prescribed benzodiazepines and to have visited emergency rooms without being readmitted than those in the control group, suggesting that the program may have increased distress in repressors.",

    "75": "Some, but not all, antipsychotics elevate serum prolactin. Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is thought to account for high rates of menstrual dysfunction and diminished estrogen levels in women with schizophrenia. However, few studies have directly assessed the relationships between prolactin, menstrual function, and ovarian hormone levels in this population. Sixteen premenopausal women with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, eight treated with an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential (five with typical antipsychotics and three with risperidone) and eight treated with an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential (seven with olanzapine and one with clozapine), were studied for eight weeks. Data were collected on menstrual functioning and on serum prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone levels, and were compared between subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential and an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential, and between subjects with hyperprolactinemia (N=6) and normoprolactinemia (N=10). Additionally, peak ovarian hormone levels were compared to normal values. While mean prolactin levels of subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential were significantly greater than those of subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential, there were no differences in rates of menstrual dysfunction or in ovarian hormone values between the two groups. Additionally, similar rates of menstrual dysfunction and ovarian hormone values were observed between the hyperprolactinemic and normoprolactinemic subjects. Moreover, irrespective of medication type or prolactin status, most subjects had peak estradiol levels below normal reference values for the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle. While our sample size is small, warranting the need for further investigation, the findings of this preliminary study suggest that antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia, alone, may not adequately explain the observed ovarian dysfunction in women with schizophrenia.",

In breast carcinoma an increase in expression of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) and the gamma aminobutyl acid (GABA) level has been discovered. Therefore, an investigation of a direct influence of GABA-A agonist propofol, GABA-A and PBR-agonist etomidate, and the local anesthetic drug lidocaine, which can also bind to the GABA-A receptor and PBR, on migration of breast carcinoma cells was performed.",

In contrast, no influence of etomidate on the number of migrating cells could be observed. The velocity and distance migrated at 3 and 4 mg/l were found to be statistically significantly enhanced. Treatment with lidocaine caused an increase in the percentage of migrating cells (up to 75.0+/-5.6) in velocity dose dependently (up to 0.33+/-0.06) and in distance migrated (up to 151.5+/-92.9).",

    "80": "Rat hepatocytes in a collagen-gel sandwich configuration were exposed to silicon alkoxides in a gas phase, yielding a 0.05 to 0.15 microm porous silica layer on the gel surface. Cell viability was unaffected by the procedure. After 24 h, bilirubin conjugation, ammonia removal, urea synthesis, and diazepam metabolism were unaffected by the procedure. However, both the ammonia removal rate and diazepam metabolism were increased after 48 hr, whereas urea synthesis was unaffected. These data indicate that silica overlay allows efficient metabolic activity of collagen-gel entrapped hepatocytes. The fact that the KM of bilirubin conjugation was unaffected by the presence of the silica membrane suggests that the transport of albumin-bound substrates is not decreased. The enhancement in some metabolic activities found 48 h after the entrapment procedure may be the result of favorable changes in the hepatocyte microenvironment. These characteristics might be useful for the development of organotypical bioartificial liver devices.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of midazolam on the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of procainamide in rabbits during two hours of observation. Procainamide was administered in rabbits at a dose of 13 mg/kg iv, and midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg iv. Procainamide levels were determined by immunofluorescence polarization method using ABBOTT reagents. Levels of procainamide were determined in the plasma at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the administration of procainamide.

    "87": "The effect of co-administration of ketamine at the sub-effective dose with diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and clonazepam on their antinociceptive and protective efficacy against pentetrazole-induced seizures were studied in mice. Ketamine alone produces dose-dependent antinociception manifested as reduction in the number of writhing episodes evoked by acetic acid. In the writhing test, the antinociceptive effects of the threshold doses of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide or clonazepam were not changed by ketamine, whereas that of morphine was intensified by ketamine. In the hot plate test, slight antinociceptive effects of the threshold dose of diazepam, but not that of chlordiazepoxide (except the results at 120 min of observation), were significantly intensified by ketamine vs ketamine alone. Ketamine alone was able to protect mice, in the dose-related manner, against pentetrazole-induced seizures. The anticonvulsant effects of the threshold doses of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and clonazepam were not changed by ketamine. These findings indicate that co-administration of ketamine (at the sub-effective dose) with diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and clonazepam (at non-effective doses) resulted in an intensification of neither antinociceptive nor protective effect against pentetrazole-induced seizures in mice. These data seem to indicate the lack of interaction between ketamine and benzodiazepines with respect to their antinociceptive and anticonvulsant efficacy.",

Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in three studies. Phenobarbital compared to supportive care alone has not been shown to reduce treatment failure or time to regain birthweight (one study). However, the duration of supportive care required to be given to infants each day was significantly reduced (MD -162.1 minutes/day, 95% CI -249.2, -75.1). Comparing phenobarbital to diazepam, meta-analysis of two studies found that phenobarbital produced a significant reduction in treatment failure (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24, 0.62). There was no significant difference in duration of treatment or duration of hospital stay. Comparing phenobarbital with chlorpromazine, one study found no significant difference in treatment failure rate. No data for neurodevelopment were available, reported by treatment group as allocated. No trials were eligible that assessed clonidine for NAS.", 
    "94": "In newborn infants with NAS, there is no evidence that phenobarbital, compared with supportive care alone, reduces treatment failure; however, phenobarbital may reduce the daily duration of supportive care needed. Phenobarbital, compared to diazepam, reduces treatment failure. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of chlorpromazine or clonidine in newborn infants with NAS. Clonidine and chlorpromazine should only be used in the context of a randomised clinical trial. The results of this review, taken in conjunction with the related review, Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants (Osborn 2002), indicate that treatment with opiates is the preferred initial therapy for NAS. It is hypothesised that this is particularly true for infants whose mothers have used only opiates during pregnancy. If a sedative is used, phenobarbital is preferred to diazepam. The results of an ongoing trial of the addition of phenobarbital to an opiate are awaited.",

After one week on a 10 mg daily dose of olanzapine, his fasting blood glucose was elevated to 11.3 mmol/L (203 mg/dL). In order to treat more aggressively his psychosis, the olanzapine dose was raised to 20 mg daily resulting in his fasting blood glucose climbing to 15.8 mmol/l (284 mg/dL). On the days preceding his death, he became progressively weaker, and developed polydipsia with polyuria. He had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus and he was on no other medication at the time of his death. Postmortem blood, vitreous humor, and urine glucose concentrations were 53 mmol/L (954 mg/dL), 49 mmol/L (882 mg/dL), and 329 mmol/L (5922 mg/dL), respectively. Drug screen on urine and blood indicated only a small amount or olanzapine and no alcohols. Peripheral blood olanzapine concentration was within therapeutic limits, 45 ng/mL. Analysis of vitreous humor and urine revealed severe dehydration with small amounts of ketones. Death was attributed to hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma, and olanzapine was felt most likely to be the cause. Another atypical neuroleptic, clozapine, has also been associated with the development and exacerbation of diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis. We recommend including vitreous glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate analysis as part of postmortem toxicology work up when the drug screen reveals the presence of either olanzapine or clozapine.",

    "101": "Schizophrenic patients generally perform poorly on tasks that address executive functions. According to several imaging studies, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is hypoactive in schizophrenic patients during these tasks. It is not, however, clear whether this finding is associated more with impaired performance than with the illness itself, as performance has not been taken into account. We examined brain activity associated with executive function in schizophrenia using an experimental fMRI design that reveals performance effects, enabling correction for performance differences between groups. As this approach has not been reported before, and because brain function can be affected by medication, the effect of antipsychotic medication was also investigated. A task was used that requires logical reasoning, alongside a closely matched control task. Performance was accounted for by including individual responses in fMRI image analyses, as well as in group-wise analysis. Effects of medication were addressed by comparing medication-na\u00efve patients and patients on atypical antipsychotic medication with healthy controls in two separate experiments. Imaging data were analysed with a novel, performance-driven method, but also with a method that is similar to that used in earlier studies, which reported hypofrontality. A modest reduction in performance was found in both patient groups. Brain activity associated with logical reasoning was correlated positively with performance in all groups. In patients on medication, activity did not differ from that in controls after correcting for difference in performance. In contrast, performance-corrected activity was significantly elevated in medication-na\u00efve patients. This study indicates that schizophrenia may be associated with excessive recruitment of brain systems during logical reasoning. Considering the fact that performance was reduced in the patients, we argue that the efficiency of neural communication may be affected by the illness. It appears that in patients on atypical antipsychotic medication, this neural inefficiency is normalized. The study shows that performance is an important factor in the interpretation of differences between schizophrenic patients and controls. The reported association between performance and brain activity is relevant to clinical imaging studies in general.", 
    "102": "A defect in neurotransmission involving gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in schizophrenia was first proposed in the early 1970s. Since that time, a considerable effort has been made to find such a defect in components of the GABAergic system. After a brief introduction focusing on historical perspectives, this paper reviews post-mortem and other biological studies examining the following components of the GABAergic system in schizophrenic subjects: the GABA biosynthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase; free GABA; the GABA transporter; the GABAA, GABAB and benzodiazepine receptors; and the catabolic enzyme GABA transaminase. Additionally, post-mortem studies using morphology or calcium-binding protein to identify GABAergic neurons are also reviewed. Substantial evidence argues for a defect in the GABAergic system of the frontal cortex in schizophrenia which is limited to the parvalbumin-class of GABAergic interneurons.",

The difference between the mean pre- and postsedation NCT times was 16.4 s (95% CI = 9.8-23.1 s; p < 0.001). A total of 38 consecutive patients without clinical or biochemical evidence of liver disease who presented for upper GI endoscopy completed the NCT as described for the group of cirrhotic patients.

This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.177). Using the upper limit of the 95% CI of the mean (37.4 s) of the presedation time in the patients without liver disease as the cut-off between normal and encephalopathy, the number of cirrhotic patients with abnormal presedation NCT times was 33 patients (54.1%), and this number rose to 46 patients (75.4%) after sedation with midazolam.

    "106": "Of decisive importance for the outcome of burn victims are the depth and extent of the burn, and the age and general state of health of the patient. At the site of the injury, the most important initial measure is the abundant application of cold water to the undressed victim. Early intubation of the burn victim should not be employed too readily. When the burns cover more than 10% of the body surface there is an acute danger of shock, and rapid fluid replacement must be aggressively pursued; the infused volume is calculated on the basis of the extent of the burn (Parkland formula). To treat pain, the i.v. administration of opiates or ketamine in combination with benzodiazepines has proven value. The onsite management of the burns should be restricted to the application of sterile dressings. Grade 1 and 2a burns may be treated out of hospital by cooling, cold water application, burn ointment dressings. More severe burns require hospitalization and surgical management. Since the severity of burn trauma is often underestimated, rapid hospitalization is to be recommended.", 
    "107": "Pronounced decrease in arterial blood pressure during propofol or midazolam infusion for sedation of critically ill patients, has raised the possibility that they have a direct negative inotropic action. Accordingly, in the current study, changes in the left ventricular (LV) contractility were examined during i.v. infusion of these two sedatives in anesthetized dogs. Myocardial contractility was assessed with the slope (Ees) of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relationship and the slope (Msw) of the LV end-diastolic volume-stroke work relationship. Propofol was administered at 5, 10 and 20 mg.kg-1.h-1, and midazolam at 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 mg.kg-1.h-1 over 60 min. Propofol caused dose-dependent decrease in Ees (55 +/- 7 during the low dose to 27 +/- 3 mmHg.ml-1 during the high dose, P < 0.05) and in Msw (91 +/- 8 during the low dose to 67 +/- 6 erg.cm-3 x 10(-3) during the high dose, P < 0.05). Midazolam, also, decreased in Ees and Msw significantly. No significant differences were observed between three different doses of midazolam. It is concluded that propofol shows the dose-dependent inhibition of myocardial contractility, but midazolam induces dose-independent inhibition.",

Midazolam could be used in patients with cardiac, or respiratory failure, and in neurosurgery. A great interindividual variability on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response was observed. In intensive care patients, elimination half-life is known to be widely increased. Midazolam is metabolised by hepatic microsomes. The major metabolite is the 1-hydroxymidazolam, which is pharmacologically active. A prolonged sedation due to an accumulation of conjugated metabolite was observed in renal failure patients.

To further clarify the functional meaning of both types of responses, we investigated whether changes of GABAergic drive could cause significant modifications of conventional as well as high-frequency SEPs. We recorded median nerve SEPs from six healthy volunteers before and after a single oral administration of lorazepam. In order to explain scalp SEP distribution before and after lorazepam administration, we performed the brain electrical source analysis of raw data. After lorazepam administration, conventional scalp SEPs showed a significant amplitude decrease of all cortical components including the primary N20/P20 response, while the subcortical P14 response remained substantially unchanged. Similarly, dipolar analysis showed a significant strength decrease of all cortical dipoles, whereas the strength of both subcortical dipoles (possibly located at the level of the brainstem and thalamus, respectively) remained unchanged. By contrast, no significant changes of high-frequency SEPs were induced by drug intake. Therefore, our findings suggest that the inhibitory effect induced by lorazepam mainly affects intracortical circuitry. Tonic increase of the inhibitory drive, possibly mediated by GABAA receptors, can account for the reduced activity of first order deep spiny neurons generating the primary N20/P20. Conversely, intrinsic firing properties of the cell population generating high-frequency SEP responses are unaffected by the increase of GABAergic drive. This finding lends further substance to the hypothesis that conventional and high-frequency SEPs are generated by different cell populations.",

A likely occasion for consideration of new QSAR approach possibilities for this aspect is the flavonoids (F) multitude, the class of organic compounds (C) with very varied chemistry and pharmacology. The list of F affinities includes benzodiazepines, adenosine, estrogen receptors and row of enzymes phosphodiesterase, proteinthyrosine kinase, aromatase, xanthine oxidase asf. The simple way of clasterization of C is their numerical representation as the vector in linear space. The components of the some vectors are determined by parameters of molecular shape (number of cycles, tertiary atoms asf) and orbital structure indices (numbers of occupied orbitals of different kind). The nonesterificied F are tricyclic C with numbers of tertiary atoms n = 5,.,11 and more, from generic flavon (flavan), n = 5, to myricetin (n = 11) and other.

The structure and continuity of sleep were unaffected by olanzapine in both sexes. The increase in both actual sleep time and slow wave sleep in females correlated with the increase in theta power, while delta power was not significantly elevated, suggesting that theta power may be a sensitive indicator of changes in sleep. The changes in sleep had the same tendency in men, but they were not significant. The difference between the sexes could not be explained by differences in body mass index. Olanzapine affects sleep probably through 5-HT(2C) receptors. The receptor gene is located on the X-chromosome, inducing an allelic difference between the females and males. This difference may contribute to the different effects of olanzapine on sleep. Olanzapine seems to preserve the normal structure of sleep and increase the amount of slow-wave sleep, which might be of additional benefit in treatment of schizophrenia. The effective clinical dose may be lower for females than males.", 
    "136": "This study set out to profile the activity of (S)-desmethylzopiclone (SEP-174559) at subtypes of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA(A)) receptor and other neurotransmitter receptor ion channels. Recombinant receptors were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined functionally by patch-clamp recording with fast perfusion of agonist and drug solutions. Micromolar concentrations of SEP-174559 potentiated GABA(A) receptor currents evoked by subsaturating concentrations of GABA. The potentiation was related to a leftward shift in the GABA dose-response curves, suggesting the drug acts to increase GABA binding affinity. The potentiation strictly required the presence of the gamma2 subunit; no enhancement was seen for receptors containing instead the gamma1 subunit or lacking a gamma subunit altogether. SEP-174559 and its parent compound, racemic zopiclone, were not selective between alpha1-, alpha2-, or alpha3-bearing GABA(A) receptors. Within the nicotinic receptor superfamily, SEP-174559 did not affect serotonin type-3 receptor function but was found to inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors. The inhibition of nACh receptors was noncompetitive and was mimicked by zopiclone, alprazolam, and diazepam. In the glutamate receptor superfamily, SEP-174559 inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor currents but did not affect non-NMDA receptors. These data confirm that SEP-174559 has benzodiazepine-like actions at gamma2-bearing subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor and suggest additional actions of benzodiazepine-site ligands at nACh and NMDA receptors.", 
    "137": "Mapping inducible transcription factors has shown that the Edinger-Westphal nucleus is preferentially sensitive to alcohol intoxication. Herein, we characterize the pharmacological and signal transduction mechanisms related to alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in Edinger-Westphal neurons. Using immunohistochemistry, we show that pretreatment with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic antagonists (4 mg/kg bicuculline and 45 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole) attenuates induction of c-Fos expression by alcohol (2.4 g/kg, intraperitoneal). In addition, 10 mg/kg 2-(2,3-dihydro-2-methoxy-1,4-benzodioxin-2-yl)4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole (RX 821002), an alpha(2A/D)-adrenoceptor antagonist, and 20 mg/kg haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, also block alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in Edinger-Westphal neurons. No effects were seen in alcohol-induced c-Fos after the pretreatment of 20 mg/kg propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), 10 mg/kg 2-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl) ethy)-4,4-dimethyl-1,3-(2H,4H)-isoquinolindione dihydrochloride (ARC 239) (alpha(2B/C)-adrenoceptor antagonist), or 30 mg/kg naltrexone (opioid antagonist). Although positive modulators for the GABA(A) receptor (20 mg/kg 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one and 10-30 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide) and opioid receptor (10 mg/kg morphine) produced significant elevations, agonists for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (clonidine) and dopamine receptors (apomorphine) had no effect on Edinger-Westphal c-Fos expression. These findings suggest that alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in Edinger-Westphal results from direct interactions with GABA(A) receptors, which are modified by alpha(2A/D)-adrenoceptors and dopamine receptors. Also using immunohistochemistry to identify potential intracellular mechanisms associated with alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in Edinger-Westphal, we show time-dependent increases in serine 727 phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) but no changes in phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein and phospho-Elk1. Time-dependent increases in phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 were found to occur simultaneously with increases in serine 727 phospho-Stat3. Finally, blockade of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor SL327 blocked alcohol-induced c-Fos expression, suggesting that alcohol induces c-Fos in Edinger-Westphal neurons through activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Stat3 pathway.",

    "143": "The influence of different neural systems that modulate GnRH secretion by hypothalamic neurons was investigated in mice exposed to hypokalemic conditions, in which the pulsatile release of GnRH has been shown to be altered and associated with a significant decrease of plasma sex steroids. Our results demonstrate that the potentiation of the inhibitory pathways mediated by opiates and GABA may be implicated in the decrease of sex hormones secretion produced by hypokalemia since treatment with higher doses of naloxone or flumazenil are required to restore progesterone or testosterone levels in potassium deficient mice. The combination treatment of prazoxin and naloxone suggests that the inhibitory action of opiates take place through its action on noradrenergic neurons. It is also possible that the inhibition of GnRH release could be due to a decrease in the tonic stimulatory action of noradrenergic pathway implicated in the control of GnRH release. Our results also reveal that it is unlikely that the glutamatergic system may play any relevant direct role in the decrease of sex steroid secretion observed in potassium deficient mice. Finally, these results together with the normal pattern of estradiol levels found along the estrus cycle in potassium deficient mice indicate that factors different from estradiol and acting on neural systems implicated in the regulation of GnRH-secreting neurons participate in the generation of the preovulatory surge of GnRH.", 
    "144": "The caspase family of cell death proteases has been implicated in the mechanism of neuronal death following seizures. We investigated the expression and processing of caspases 6 and 7, putative executioner caspases. Brief limbic seizures were evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid to elicit unilateral death of target hippocampal CA3 neurons in the rat. Seizures rapidly induced cleavage of constitutively expressed caspase-6, followed by elevated VEIDase activity and the proteolysis of lamin A. Neuronal caspase-6 immunoreactivity was markedly upregulated within cortex and hippocampus in relation to bursts of polyspike paroxysmal discharges. In contrast, while caspase-7 expression also increased within cortical and hippocampal neuronal populations in response to the same seizure patterns, caspase-7 was not proteolytically activated. These data highlight differences in expression and activation of caspases 6 and 7 in response to identifiable seizure patterns, focusing potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection in epilepsy.", 
    "145": "Rat neocortical slices express spontaneous epileptiform activity after incubation with GABA(A) receptor blocker bicuculline (BIC, 20 microM), with potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 50 microM) or in Mg(2+)-free medium (LMG). Various parameters of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform discharges and their pharmacological sensitivity were analysed using extracellular field potential recordings in this comparative in vitro study. All types of convulsant solution induced spontaneous epileptiform activity, however, the analysed parameters showed that characteristics of epileptiform discharges are rather different in the three models. The longest duration of discharges was recorded in LMG, while the highest frequency of spontaneous events was detected in 4-AP. The epileptiform field responses elicited by electrical stimulation appeared in an all-or-none manner in BIC. On the contrary, in 4-AP and in LMG the amplitude of the responses increased gradually with increasing stimulation intensities. The NMDA receptor antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 25 microM) abolished the LMG induced spontaneous epileptiform activity and significantly reduced the frequency of the epileptiform discharges in BIC and 4-AP. Blocking the AMPA type of glutamate transmission with 1-(aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466, 40 microM) rapidly abolished BIC-induced spontaneous epileptiform activity and caused a significant decrease in the frequency of 4-AP induced spontaneous epileptiform discharges. However, it had only a weak effect on the LMG-induced epileptiform activity. We conclude that the contribution of NMDA and AMPA types of glutamate receptors to the development and maintenance of epileptiform activity in cortical cell assemblies is different in the three models. There are significant alterations in contribution of NMDA and AMPA types of glutamate receptors to the above-mentioned processes in the different convulsants. In BIC the synchronisation is mainly due to the altered network properties, namely inhibition is reduced in the local circuits. Although inhibition is reduced in the local circuits, the AMPA receptor antagonist relatively easily blocked the synchronised excitation. In 4-AP, and especially in LMG, changes in the membrane characteristics of neurones play a crucial role in the increased excitability. In this case the AMPA antagonist was less effective.", 
    "146": "The influence of molsidomine, a donor of nitric oxide (NO), L-arginine, a substrate for NO synthesis, and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (NNA), an inhibitor of NO synthase, on the protective activity of CGP 40116, GYKI 52466, MK-801, and riluzole against electroconvulsions was studied in mice. Molsidomine (100 mg kg(-1); i.p.) potentiated the protective activity of GYKI 52466, MK-801, and riluzole but did not influence the protection offered by CGP 40116. In contrast to molsidomine, L-arginine (500 mg kg(-1); i.p.) did not impair the protective activity of any anticonvulsant. In a dose of 40 mg kg(-1), NNA administered i.p. did not affect the protection offered by any excitatory amino acid antagonists and riluzole. Combinations of molsidomine with either GYKI 52466 or MK-801 as well as riluzole did not cause a memory deficit in the passive avoidance task. However, the combined treatment of molsidomine with these anticonvulsants resulted in a motor impairment quantified by the chimney test. The lack of effect of L-arginine and NNA on the protective activity of excitatory amino acid antagonists suggests that molsidomine-evoked alterations in the protection provided by some excitatory amino acid antagonists against electroconvulsions are independent of the NO pathway.", 
    "147": "It was previously documented that calcium (Ca(2+)) channel inhibitors intensified the protective effects of conventional antiepileptics against electroconvulsions in mice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ca(2+) channel inhibitors (nifedipine, nicardipine and flunarizine) on the anticonvulsant action of the new AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 7-acetyl-3-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxazolo[4,5-h][2,3]-benzodiazepine (LY 300164), against maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures in mice. Dantrolene (an inhibitor of Ca(2+)release from intracellular stores) was also included. Nifedipine (30 mg/kg) and flunarizine (15 mg/kg) raised the threshold for electroconvulsions, being ineffective at lower doses. Nicardipine (up to 30 mg/kg) and dantrolene (up to 20 mg/kg) did not affect this parameter. Flunarizine (10 mg/kg), nicardipine (20 mg/kg) and dantrolene (20 mg/kg) potentiated the efficacy of LY 300164 against MES. However, nicardipine (at 20 mg/kg) raised the free plasma concentration of LY 300164. Nifedipine (30 mg/kg), given even in a dose raising the electroconvulsive threshold, did not significantly alter the protective effect of LY 300164 against MES. Furthermore, the Ca(2+) channel agonist-BAY k-8644 (at 5 mg/kg) did not influence the protection offered by LY 300164 against MES. Finally, this Ca(2+) channel activator did not affect the enhanced efficacy of LY 300164 by Ca(2+) channel modulators. The only exception was the combination of LY 300164 with flunarizine. Combined treatment with LY 300164 and dantrolene (20 mg/kg), compared to LY 300164 alone, resulted in an impairment of motor performance in mice. Ca(2+) channel inhibitors were without effect upon this parameter evaluated in the chimney test. As shown in the passive avoidance task, LY 300164 alone (at its ED(50)) or combined with agents affecting neuronal Ca(2+) concentration did not disturb long-term memory. The present results suggest that agents preventing influx of Ca(2+) ions into neurons may enhance the protective action of LY 300164.",

The biological tests have shown that only the 7-fluorosubstituted compounds 3a and 4a and the N-benzyl derivative 7 have a good affinity toward the benzodiazepine receptors, while only the 7-trifluoromethyl substituted compound 3b presents a moderate affinity with low selectivity toward the A(1) adenosine receptors.

The effects of the PBR ligand PK11195 on the photodynamic activity have been determined in vivo for certain members of this series of alkyl-substituted ethers: two of the most active derivatives (hexyl and heptyl), the least active derivative (dodecyl [C12]) and one of intermediate activity (octyl [C8]). The photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect was inhibited by PK11195 for both of the most active derivatives, but no effect on PDT activity was found for the less active C12 or C8 ethers. The inhibitory effects of PK11195 were predicted by the binding of only the active derivatives to the benzodiazepine site on albumin, ie. human serum albumin (HSA)-Site II. Thus, as with certain other types of photosensitizers, it has been demonstrated with this series of pyropheophorbide ethers that in vitro binding to HSA-Site II is a predictor of both optimal in vivo activity and binding to the PBR in vivo.",

No physical stress was not received. 1.85 MBq of 125I-IMZ was injected into the lateral tail vein and the rat was killed 3 hours later. Twenty-micrometer-thick sections of the brain were collected and % injected dose per body weight (%ID/BW) of eleven regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital cortices, caudate putamen, accumubens nuclei, globus pallidus, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus and hypothalamus) were calculated by autoradiography.

    "161": "The individual sensitivity of the male Wistar rats to acute pentylenetetrazole injection was studied, the density and the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebellar cortex for 3H-diazepam was measured. It was demonstrated that the reactivity of benzodiazepine receptors underlies the individual sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole. The animals with higher sensitivity were characterized by more intensive reaction than the control and resistant animals, i.e., by an decrease in the receptors density (the initial receptors density being equal in the sensitive, resistant, and control animals). Daily injections of a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole during 24 days increase the animal sensitivity to this substance, and this was accompanied by an increase in the reactivity of benzodiasepine receptors. Later on, the produced high sensitivity became somewhat lower but persisted for 6 months. The receptors density in this period reduced almost by half. In sensitive rats, a single low dose of pentylenetetrazole injected 6 months after treatment increased the density of benzodiazepine receptors. The age-matched controls, the same acute dose of pentylenetetrazole decreased both the receptor density and affinity of their binding. It is suggested that the increase in reactivity of benzodiazepine receptors is actualized via the intracellular metabotropic feedback mechanism.",

Diazepam reduced aggression in animals with previous 3- and 20-day experience of aggression, but the plus-maze test revealed an anxiogenic effect of this drug in the former group and anxiolytic effect in the latter group. It was hypothesized that previous aggression experience modified animal sensitivity to diazepam. The effect of the drug depends on psychoemotional status of experimental animals, and this status differs in male mice with short- and long-term experience of aggression.", 
    "163": "To identify an appropriate animal model for the study of drug interaction via CYP3A4 inhibition, the inhibition of in vitro mexazolam metabolism by various 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors [simvastatin (lactone), simvastatin acid, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, pravastatin lactone, and pravastatin (acid)] in male and female rat liver microsomes was investigated and compared with that by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in human liver microsomes reported previously. The metabolism of mexazolam in male and female rat liver microsomes was inhibited by all the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors examined except pravastatin (acid). The K(i) values in female rats were lower than those in male rats, demonstrating the presence of a sex difference in the inhibition potency of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors toward mexazolam. Using anti-cytochrome P450 (P450) antisera, the main P450 isozyme responsible for the metabolism of mexazolam was identified as CYP3A in female rats and CYP2C11 in male rats. Based on these results, we speculate that the sex difference in the inhibition potency of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for mexazolam observed in rats is caused by their different inhibition potencies against CYP2C11 and CYP3A isoforms. For mexazolam metabolism, the results obtained in female rats, rather than those in male rats, seem to be a much better reflection of the results in humans. Since species and sex differences were observed in P450 isozymes in the present study, our results show that establishing appropriate experimental conditions, in particular with respect to the P450 isozymes responsible for the drug metabolism in question, is indispensable for the investigation of drug interactions using rats as a model animal for humans.", 
    "164": "The human cytochromes P450 (P450) CYP3A contribute to the biotransformation of 50% of oxidatively metabolized drugs. The predominant hepatic form is CYP3A4, but recent evidence indicates that CYP3A5 contributes more significantly to the total liver CYP3A than was originally thought. CYP3A7 is the major fetal form and is rarely expressed in adults. To compare the metabolic capabilities of CYP3A forms for 10 substrates, incubations were performed using a consistent molar ratio (1:7:9) of recombinant CYP3A, P450 reductase, and cytochrome b5. A wide range of substrate concentrations was examined to determine the best fit to kinetic models for metabolite formation. In general, K(m) or S(50) values for the substrates were 3 to 4 times lower for CYP3A4 than for CYP3A5 or CYP3A7. For a more direct comparison of these P450 forms, clearance to the metabolites was determined as a linear relationship of rate of metabolite formation for the lowest substrate concentrations examined. The clearance for 1'-hydroxy midazolam formation at low substrate concentrations was similar for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. For CYP3A5 versus CYP3A4, clearance values at low substrate concentrations were 2 to 20 times lower for the other biotransformations. The clearance values for CYP3A7-catalyzed metabolite formation at low substrate concentrations were substantially lower than for CYP3A4 or CYP3A5, except for clarithromycin, 4-OH triazolam, and N-desmethyl diltiazem (CYP3A5 - CYP3A7). The CYP3A forms demonstrated regioselective differences in some of the biotransformations. These results demonstrate an equal or reduced metabolic capability for CYP3A5 compared with CYP3A4 and a significantly lower capability for CYP3A7.", 
    "165": "Excessive action potential (AP) prolongation and early afterdepolarizations (EAD) are triggers of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. A slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) is important for repolarization of ventricular AP. We examined the effects of I(Ks) activation by a new benzodiazepine (L3) on the AP of control, dofetilide-treated, and hypertrophied rabbit ventricular myocytes. In both control and hypertrophied myocytes, L3 activated I(Ks) via a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation and a slowing of deactivation. L3 had no effect on L-type Ca(2+) current or other cardiac K+ currents tested. L3 shortened AP of control, dofetilide-treated, and hypertrophied myocytes more at 0.5 than 2 Hz. Selective activation of I(Ks) by L3 attenuates prolonged AP and eliminated EAD induced by rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current inhibition in control myocytes at 0.5 Hz and spontaneous EAD in hypertrophied myocytes at 0.2 Hz. Pharmacological activation of I(Ks) is a promising new strategy to suppress arrhythmias resulting from excessive AP prolongation in patients with certain forms of long QT syndrome or cardiac hypertrophy and failure.",

In the present study, we investigated the effects of zaleplon on learning and memory in rats in comparison with triazolam and nitrazepam. Oral administration of zaleplon and the reference drugs dose-dependently lessened the step-through latency in the test session of a passive avoidance task and increased the latency for reaching the hidden platform in the Morris water maze task, indicating the amnesic effect of the test drugs. The amnesic liability ratio for zaleplon in the passive avoidance task to sleep inducing activity was 19.6, for triazolam and nitrazepam 4.2 and 5.9, respectively. The liability ratios derived from the Morris water maze task for zaleplon, triazolam and nitrazepam were 10.2, 0.9 and 0.6, respectively. The results may indicate that zaleplon has a preferential sedative effect and that the sedative dose does not interfere with learning and memory. In a binding study, zaleplon displaced bound [(3)H]flunitrazepam from membrane preparations from the rat hippocampus with an IC(50) of 4,454.5 nM. In contrast, triazolam and nitrazepam displaced the binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam to the membrane with IC(50) values of 15.5 nM and 83.6 nM, respectively. The efficacy of zaleplon for the competitive inhibition of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the membrane preparation from hippocampus was thus less than that of triazolam and nitrazepam. These results suggest that zaleplon is characterized by a reduced amnesic liability, which may be due to its low affinity for the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor in the hippocampus.",

    "183": "Atropine is the drug of choice for treatment of organophosphate nerve agent and insecticide intoxication and has been used for this indication for several decades. Adverse reactions to atropine may occur, and are of two types: toxic and allergic. Toxic reaction, the most common form, results from the anti-muscarinic effects of the drug. Since it is most probably related to interpersonal variation in sensitivity to atropine, toxic effects may appear at the usual therapeutic doses. The second type, allergic reaction, includes local manifestations, usually after the administration of eyedrops, and systemic reaction in the form of anaphylaxis. Since most patients manifest only a mild reaction, allergy testing is not performed and the prevalence of allergy to atropine is therefore not known. Severe allergic reaction to atropine is rare, as evidenced by the small number of case reports in the literature despite the drug's extensive use. Alternative anti-muscarinic drugs recommended for OP poisoning include glycopyrrolate and scopolamine. Glycopyrrolate is a peripheral anti-muscarinic drug that has been studied in comparison to atropine for many clinical indications, while scopolamine is an anti-muscarinic drug with both peripheral and central effects. An acceptable alternative regimen for patients with proven allergy to atropine is a combination of glycopyrrolate with centrally active drugs such as benzodiazepines or scopolamine.",

    "203": "The fear-potentiated startle paradigm has been characterized for drugs that act via ionotropic (NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor) glutamate receptor mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that the potent systemically active mGlu2/3 receptor agonist, LY354740, effectively reduced the expression of fear-potentiated startle responses in rats. The present study examined the effects of LY354740 in a pre- versus post-fear conditioning paradigm and compared the effects to diazepam. Diazepam (0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg ip) attenuated both pre- and post-fear conditioning startle responses in a dose-related manner. In contrast, LY354740 (0.03, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg ip) did not disrupt preconditioning startle responses at doses that attenuated post-fear conditioning responses. The benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, at a dose (2 mg/kg sc) that did not alter fear-potentiated startle per se, selectively reversed suppression of fear responses to diazepam (0.6 mg/kg ip) while not affecting fear suppression induced by LY354740 (0.3 mg/kg ip). At a dose of 1 mg/kg ip, the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, LY341495, did not disrupt fear-enhanced startle per se, but completely reversed the postconditioning anxiolytic effects of LY354740 in this model. This dose of LY341495 had no effect on fear suppression by diazepam. These results demonstrate that fear suppression by diazepam and LY354740 involves different neuronal mechanisms. While diazepam acts via the facilitation of GABAergic transmission, LY354740 induces its actions via the glutamatergic system, specifically mGlu2/3 receptor activation. Furthermore, in contrast to disruption of fear conditioning as well as fear suppression by diazepam, LY354740 had selective effects on fear expression, suggesting anxiolytic actions without the associated memory impairment.", 
    "204": "The selective and systemically active antagonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) was shown to display anxiolytic-like activity in a number of unconditioned assays of stress and anxiety (elevated plus maze, shock probe burying, marble burying, social interaction, and stress-induced hyperthermia) in rodents. In this report, we extend these observations found using unconditioned models of anxiety to include three models of conditioned anxiety, comparing the activity of MPEP to the clinically used anxiolytics, diazepam, and buspirone. MPEP and diazepam, but not buspirone, showed anxiolytic-like activity in the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) model. In a conditioned ultrasonic vocalization (USV) procedure, MPEP, diazepam, and buspirone reduced vocalizations to a similar degree. In the modified Geller-Seifter procedure, MPEP, diazepam, and buspirone displayed statistically significant anxiolytic-like activity, increasing the number of punished responses. Thus, these findings confirm and extend previous reports that MPEP exhibits anxiolytic-like activity in rats, and suggests that development of mGluR5 antagonists may provide a novel approach to treating anxiety disorders.", 
    "205": "Effects of conditioned emotional stimuli (CES), which induce psychological stress, on the expression of cerebral diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) mRNA in mouse were examined using a communication box. Cerebral DBI mRNA expression significantly increased in a time-dependent manner after the application of CES. The maximal enhancement of DBI mRNA expression was observed 2 days after the application of CES, and this increase faded out over 7 days after the treatment. Flunitrazepam (1 mg/kg), an agonist for central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, completely abolished the CES-induced elevation of cerebral DBI contents and its mRNA expressions. These results indicate that cerebral DBI is enhanced by psychological stress, which is regulated by central BZD receptors."
