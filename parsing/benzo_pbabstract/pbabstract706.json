    "0": "A double-blind controlled comparison of four commonly-used tranquillizing drugs (haloperidol, amylobarbitone sodium, chlordiazepoxide, and trifluoperazine) against placebo was made in their effects on the performance of volunteers during three low speed vehicle-handling tests. The drugs (with the exception of haloperidol) significantly altered driving behaviour though they did not seem to interact significantly with alcohol. There is, therefore, a strong possibility that such drugs will similarly alter driving performance in patients taking them for therapeutic purposes. Since, as these experiments also show, those affected may be subjectively unaware of it, and routine clinical screening is not sensitive enough to detect them, physicians should warn patients of the probability that their driving performance will be affected by such drugs, particularly during the first few days that they are taken.", 
    "1": "The influence of the newer, non-barbiturate hypnotics Mandrax (diphenhydramine-methaqualone) and nitrazepam on drug-metabolizing capacity was assessed and compared with the effect of amylobarbitone, a known inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Plasma antipyrine and phenylbutazone half-lives and urinary output of 6beta-hydroxycortisol were used as indices. Volunteer subjects were exposed to therapeutic amounts of these agents and, in the case of Mandrax and barbiturates, further studies were carried out in dependent patients.Mandrax but not nitrazepam increased the rate of drug metabolism, presumably by enzyme induction. The degree of induction was comparable with that produced by hypnotic doses of amylobarbitone. The Mandrax-dependent and barbiturate-dependent patients were the fastest metabolizers studied. It is concluded that drug interactions resulting from interference with drug metabolism are as likely to occur with Mandrax as with barbiturates. On the other hand, it is unlikely that such drug interactions would occur with nitrazepam.", 
    "2": "Pulmonary aspiration occurred in 16 out of 65 patients (24.6%) undergoing fibre-endoscopic examinations of the upper gastrointestinal tract under intravenous sedation, but it was rarely followed by serious complications. Aspiration was found to occur under sedation with diazepam alone, diazepam with atropine, and with chlormethiazole. The most important factors contributing to aspiration are the local pharyngeal anaesthesia and the mechanical interference of the fibrescope with laryngeal closure and swallowing. The patient is also at risk of aspiration after completion of the procedure and should remain recumbent until the local anaesthesia has worn off."
