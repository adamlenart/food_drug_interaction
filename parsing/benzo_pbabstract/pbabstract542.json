    "0": "The actions and side effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were evaluated in a randomized double-blind clinical study in which midazolam was used as an anaesthetic agent. Sixty women who underwent laparoscopy were treated with Ro 15-1788 or with placebo after the surgical procedure. Ro 15-1788 reversed the hypnotic effect of midazolam within a few minutes. The patients were alert, co-operative, oriented and had good recall of events after awakening. The effects were statistically better than placebo for up to 30 min after administration. Arterial pressure and heart rate remained stable and there were no significant side effects. The availability of Ro 15-1788 allows effective reversal of midazolam when this is used during general anaesthesia.", 
    "1": "Thirty-three patients undergoing elective myocardial revascularization were prospectively randomized into two study groups (Group S and Group P) to permit evaluation of the effects of shivering on oxygen consumption per minute (VO2), carbon dioxide production per minute (VCO2), and hemodynamic performance. Group S was allowed to shiver during the postoperative rewarming period, and Group P received hourly injections of pancuronium bromide and Metubine (metocurine) sulfate with sedation to block the shivering response. Group S demonstrated significantly higher increases in VO2 and VCO2, lower systolic blood pressure and mixed venous oxygen saturation, and a greater use of inotropic support than the patients in Group P. Suppression of the shivering response minimized increases in VO2 and VCO2, improved hemodynamic stability, and resulted in a decreased need for inotropic support.", 
    "2": "RO 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, although it effectively antagonizes the clinical effects of benzodiazepines (i.e., sedation and amnesia), can also induce subjective agonist effects such as sedation or inverse agonist effects such as anxiety. The purpose of this study was to investigate in seven healthy volunteers the effect of RO 15-1788 on cerebral blood flow when intravenously injected alone or with midazolam and to compare its effects with midazolam administered alone. Cerebral blood flow was measured with the 133xenon inhalation technique and the drugs were administered simultaneously in a double-blind, randomized fashion during the four following sessions: placebo-placebo; midazolam-placebo; RO 15-1788-placebo; midazolam-RO 15-1788. No difference in cerebral blood flow was noted between the placebo-placebo, the RO 15-1788-placebo, and the RO 15-1788-midazolam sessions--although midazolam injected alone decreased cerebral blood flow by 30%. The sedation, amnesia, and the electroencephalograph (EEG) and muscle tone changes observed with midazolam-placebo were not present during the RO 15-1788-placebo and RO 15-1788-midazolam sessions. This study demonstrates the absence of effects of RO 15-1788 on cerebral blood flow when injected alone and the efficacy of this new drug in antagonizing the depressant effects of midazolam on cerebral hemodynamics.", 
    "3": "In a single patient suffering from a major depressive episode with melancholia (DSM-III), both severe psychomotor symptoms, such as stupor and mutism, and mood disturbances could be abolished completely and promptly by administration of the benzodiazepine lorazepam. Remission of symptoms was entirely and immediately reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. These drug effects were constantly reproducible. Possible mechanisms of action and the influence of GABAergic neurotransmission on affective and psychomotor state are discussed.", 
    "4": "The source and significance of plasma levels of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the precursor of the endogenous catecholamines, have been unknown. We measured arterial and venous plasma DOPA concentrations in healthy subjects at rest, patients who had undergone regional sympathectomies or were undergoing general anesthesia, and subjects during procedures (tilt, oral clonidine, or iv isoproterenol, yohimbine, trimethaphan, or diazepam) known to affect plasma norepinephrine levels. We also measured plasma DOPA in laboratory animals during anesthesia, after adrenalectomy, or after administration of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, which competitively inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, the intraneuronal enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. In virtually all healthy subjects there was an arteriovenous increment in plasma DOPA (mean increase, 32%; P less than 0.001), whereas in sympathectomized patients there was not (mean decrease, 16%; P less than 0.001 compared with healthy subjects). Except for small decreases after clonidine treatment, none of the above procedures affected plasma DOPA levels. Plasma DOPA decreased during general anesthesia and returned to baseline upon reversal of the anesthesia. Adrenalectomy had no effect on plasma DOPA. alpha-Methyl-para-tyrosine decreased plasma DOPA by 62% (P less than 0.01). The results support the suggestion that DOPA can pass across sympathetic neuronal membranes to reach the general circulation. If so, then the regional rate of appearance of DOPA in plasma may be related to the regional rate of tyrosine hydroxylation. Conversely, DOPA taken up from the circulation may provide a source for catecholamine biosynthesis in tissues devoid of tyrosine hydroxylase.", 
    "5": "In a previous study, it was found that positive, palatability-dependent consummatory reactions in rats to intraorally infused tastes were facilitated by chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg). In contrast, the rats' more neutral or aversive reactions to these tastes were not facilitated by chlordiazepoxide. This suggested that chlordiazepoxide might selectively enhance the positive palatability of tastes. This effect was replicated in the present experiment, and in addition, the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 were found to counteract the enhancement of positive ingestive reactions produced by chlordiazepoxide. These antagonist effects generally suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor complex may be involved in making tastes more palatable after chlordiazepoxide administration.", 
    "6": "The effects of a single (15 mg) dose of diazepam, a 3-week course of diazepam (25 mg/d) and its withdrawal on plasma MHPG and the reduction produced by clonidine (1.5 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were studied in 8 male volunteers. Chronic diagram reduced, but not significantly, plasma MHPG and attenuated the reduction produced Gyclonidine. During the withdrawal phase MHPG levels were significantly enhanced and the lowering produced by clonidine was also greater. These results support the hypothesis that some aspects of benzodiazepine withdrawal may reflect excessive central noradrenergic activity.", 
    "7": "Some GABA-ergic drugs are known to produce electroencephalographic and behavioral signs of inhibition as well as alterations of the visual evoked potential (VEP) similar in shape and parameters to those in experimental fulminant hepatic failure. These findings, along with a number of biochemical findings, were considered to support the theory attributing hepatic encephalopathy to enhanced GABA-ergic transmission. The present review demonstrates that it is uncertain whether electrographic correlates of experimental encephalopathy can be attributed to faulty GABA-ergic mechanisms; nor it is clear whether drug-induced alterations of electrocortical potentials and those recorded in acute hepatic failure share a common pathogenesis. Special emphasis is put on findings with visual evoked potentials altered by drugs acting at GABA/benzodiazepine receptors to show the diversity of changes associated with the activity of the GABA system. Attention is called to the fact that brain GABA increase as a mechanism of hepatic encephalopathy was discussed without specifying the nature and anatomical location of allegedly impaired neural circuits utilizing the neurotransmitter.", 
    "8": "Urine samples were obtained from 93% of a sample of 111 consecutive male admissions to a nonmedical detoxication center in Toronto. Analysis of these samples revealed that 51 (50%) had traces of drugs other than alcohol and that 12 (12%) were alcohol free. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently detected drugs and these were found in 32% of all samples. Barbiturates were detected in seven (7%) samples and cannabinoids in 10 (10%) samples. A wide range of urine alcohol concentrations was found and some samples had zero or low concentrations. Although alcohol urine concentrations were generally lower in samples containing other drugs, the distribution of urine alcohol concentrations was similar for samples containing only alcohol and those containing alcohol and some other drug. Of the 51 samples found to contain drugs other than alcohol, subjects' self-reports were concordant in 27 cases (53%). Most of the discrepancies between self-reports and urine analysis were due to the under-reporting of the use of benzodiazepines. Subjects with drugs in their urine tended to be younger than others, but they were not distinguished with respect to their behaviors while in the detoxication center or length of stay. Those with the highest urine alcohol concentrations had shorter stays in the detoxication center. Implications for further studies are discussed.", 
    "9": "The equilibrium binding constants of [3H]Ro 5-4864 (a \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptor ligand) to renal membranes preserved by various freezing techniques were investigated. The Bmax for [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to membranes from kidneys preserved as unwashed homogenates stored at -80, -20, or 5 degrees C, whole kidneys stores at -20 or 5 degrees C or as washed homogenate stored at -20 degrees C was significantly decreased (approximately 35%). Only when kidneys were frozen intact (using a dry-ice/acetone slurry) and stored at -80 degrees C was the density of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding unchanged. However, the Bmax of [3H]PK 11195 (a putative \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) binding to renal membranes was unchanged following storage techniques that reduced the density of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding 38%. No change was observed in the Kd values for [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 binding to renal membranes preserved under any condition tested. These results demonstrate a method for the preservation of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to renal membranes, and suggests that [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 bind to unique sites on or near the \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptor.

    "10": "The National Institute of Forensic Toxicology, Oslo, receives blood and urine samples from all Norwegian drivers apprehended on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In 1983 we received samples from 1446 drug-suspected drivers, out of which 445 underwent toxicological analysis. The drugs found most frequently were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (n = 199), diazepam (n = 166) and amphetamine (n = 102). A cautious interpretation of the data indicate that about 200 of the 445 subjects selected for toxicological analysis drove under severe influence of drugs. Because of the high percentage of submitted cases not analysed for drugs, this figure represents a minimum estimate. Compared with the results from 1978, we found a several-fold increase in detections of THC and amphetamine in 1983. The number of diazepam detections did not increase in a similar way, but we estimated that the diazepam detections would have increased 3-fold if we had analysed as frequent for this drug in 1983 as in 1978.", 
    "11": "Benzodiazepine-receptor ligands belong to several different chemical classes. All of them bind to the receptor but display a variety of biological effects ranging from agonist to inverse agonist to antagonist. The properties of the most representative compounds for each class are briefly reviewed as concerns their receptor binding affinities, gamma-aminobutyric acid ratios, photoaffinity labeling ratios, and pharmacological properties. Their geometries, as obtained by X-ray crystallography, are discussed and missing crystal and molecular structures of two of them (zopiclone and CL 218-872) are reported. Binding and intrinsic activity properties of series of benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines are extensively analyzed and correlated with their molecular structures. A general stereochemical model accounting for both binding abilities and kinds of biochemical and pharmacological activities for all benzodiazepine-receptor ligands is proposed. This is based on the assumption of a rather diffuse and substantially planar recognition site where the main drug-receptor interactions are mediated by the drug carbonylic or iminic groups via hydrogen bonding and the observed differences in pharmacological profiles are accounted for by the different localization of the different ligands inside this unique binding site.", 
    "12": "Certain steroids are potent barbiturate-like modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA) receptor-chloride ionophore complex in rat brain membranes. At nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations, these steroids stimulate [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H] muscimol binding and displace the convulsant [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate from its binding site in an allosteric manner, in addition to enhancing Cl- conductance responses to GABA recorded in cultured rat hippocampal and spinal neurons. A stringent structure-activity relationship exists for these interactions of steroids with the GABAA receptor complex. Comparison of the structure-activity relationship data obtained in this study with those for steroid-induced general anesthesia strongly suggests that steroidal anesthesia may result from the interaction between steroids and the GABAA receptor. The essential features of the active structures are a 5 alpha or 5 beta-reduced pregnane skeleton with a hydroxyl at C3 in the alpha-position and a ketone group at C20. These features are all present in some naturally occurring steroids, including metabolites of deoxycorticosterone and progesterone, that show potent activity at the GABAA receptor complex. Two of the compounds investigated are known to be formed in vivo as reduced metabolites of endogenous steroid hormones: 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha -ol-20-one and 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one, which are derived from progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, respectively. These two steroids produce a striking prolongation of GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded at synapses between rat hippocampal neurons in culture and could conceivably regulate GABA-mediated inhibition under some physiologic and pathologic conditions.", 
    "13": "\"Peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptors are localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. We have identified potent competitive inhibitors of these receptors and purified them from human blood and from several rat organs. TLC analysis of the purified inhibitor from erythrocytes displays a single peak of inhibitory activity with an absorbance spectrum identical to hemin. All of the inhibitory activity in extracts of several tissues can be accounted for by their porphyrin and metalloporphyrin content. Pure hemin and protoporphyrin IX competitively inhibit mitochondrial benzodiazepine binding with Ki values of 41 and 15 nM, respectively, and are less active by a factor of 1000 at central-type benzodiazepine receptors. Thus, porphyrins appear to be endogenous ligands for mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "14": "The synthesis of the first beta-carboline, 6-(benzylamino)-beta-carboline (1c), to be devoid of a substituent at the 3-position and that still binds to benzodiazepine receptors with potent affinity is described. Furthermore, 1c proved to be a partial inverse agonist when tested in mice. Addition of the benzylamino group at the 6-position of the beta-carboline nucleus is primarily responsible for the activity of beta-carbolines 1b and 1c. The importance of the Nb-nitrogen atom for binding affinity was also demonstrated since 3-(benzylamino)carbazole (6) exhibited little or no affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in vitro, in contrast to the activity of 1c.", 
    "15": "The relationship between the stability of potential neurochemical markers and autolysis time was studied at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C using postmortem brain samples from two rat strains. In general, qualitatively similar results were obtained with either N/Nih or Sprague-Dawley rats; however, quantitative differences were often observed, particularly in regard to benzodiazepine receptor changes. For every enzyme activity or binding property examined, no significant change was found when brains were kept at 4 degrees C for up to 72 h prior to freezing at -70 degrees C. Na,K-ATPase and low-affinity Ca-ATPase activities were also stable in brains kept at 25 degrees C for up to 72 h. Mg-ATPase activity was reduced in brains kept at 25 degrees C for 24 and 48 h. [3H]Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid [( 3H]GEMSA) binding to enkephalin convertase in the cytosol was not significantly changed in brains kept at 25 degrees C; however, a small increase was seen for [3H]GEMSA binding to the membrane fraction at 24, but not 48 and 72 h postmortem. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors decreased in brains kept at 25 degrees C for 72 h. Opioid receptor binding also decreased in brains kept at 25 degrees C. Using [3H]2-D-alanine-5-D-leucine enkephalin to label delta opioid receptors, a statistically significant decrease in binding was observed as early as 6 h postmortem, and was completely abolished after 72 h at 25 degrees C. In contrast, [3H]naloxone binding was unchanged after 24 h at 25 degrees C, but was decreased after 48 and 72 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "When rat brain membranes were incubated with the benzodiazepine agonist [3H]flunitrazepam or the partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist [3H]Ro 15-4513 in the presence of ultraviolet light one protein (P51) was specifically and irreversibly labeled in cerebellum and at least two proteins (P51 and P55) were labeled in hippocampus. After digestion of the membranes with trypsin, protein P51 was degraded into several peptides. When P51 was photolabeled with [3H]Ro 15-4513, four peptides with apparent molecular weights of 39,000, 29,000, 21,000, and 17,000 were observed. When P51 was labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam, only two peptides with apparent molecular weights of 39,000 and 25,000 were obtained. Protein P55 was only partially degraded by trypsin, and whether it was labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]Ro 15-4513 it yielded the same two proteolytic peptides with apparent molecular weights of 42,000 and 45,000. These results support the existence of at least two different benzodiazepine receptor subtypes associated with proteins P51 and P55. The different receptors seem to be differentially protected against treatment with trypsin. In addition, these results indicate that in the benzodiazepine receptor subtype associated with P51 benzodiazepine agonists and partial inverse benzodiazepine agonists irreversibly bind to different parts of the molecule.", 
    "17": "The late evolutionary appearance of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) allows an experimental approach for evaluation of the qualitative development of its subunits. Photoaffinity labeling of brain membranes with [3H]flunitrazepam followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography offers a suitable method for tracing the qualitative evolution of the BZR. A systematic comparison of the subunit patterns in fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals revealed that the subunit of 53K is phylogenetically the oldest photoaffinity labeled subunit; whereas it is the only band present in the lungfish and most amphibians, additional bands are apparent in higher tetrapods. In fishes, the evolution of the BZR subunits leads to the loss of the 53K subunit. KD values are discussed in relation to specific subunit patterns. Possible explanations for the observed variation of the subunits are discussed, with special emphasis placed on the possible evolution by gene duplication and subsequent divergence.", 
    "18": "Quazepam is a new benzodiazepine that may provide good hypnotic action with negligible effect on motor coordination or respiration. Sleep laboratory studies on human volunteers have shown quazepam 15 mg to be an effective hypnotic dose, with the 30-mg dose being optimal. At these doses, there was no deterioration of motor performance, and the drug, when given nightly for two weeks, continued to exert hypnotic effects without serious adverse effects. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the respiratory effects of quazepam 15 and 30 mg to those of pentobarbital 50 and 150 mg and to placebo. Five adult male volunteers received each dose at separate times. A double-blind technique was employed for controlled rebreathing studies, to a ventilation of 40 L/min or a PETCO2 of 8%. Respiratory curves were compared with controls. The mean displacement curve at the 20-liter intercept showed a depressant effect for pentobarbital 150 mg at two hours and a stimulant effect for quazepam 15 mg at two hours but a slight depression effect for quazepam 30 mg at three hours compared with placebo. The slope of the respiratory curve was not affected.",

It inhibited crossed extensor reflexes in chicks and augmented the dorsal root reflex potential, the increase of which is considered to be an index of increased GABAergic presynaptic inhibition. Suriclone produced high-amplitude slow waves in the amygdala and cerebral cortex and desynchronization of theta waves in the hippocampus in rat electroencephalogram (EEG). These observations were quantitatively confirmed by power spectrum analysis of EEG. The mechanisms of action of suriclone on the CNS are discussed in relation to those of benzodiazepines.", 
    "20": "Increasing concentrations of either ethanol, etonitazene, clomethiazole or midazolam were offered to male Wistar rats for 21 days. Between day 8 and day 21, the animals were treated with several doses of harman, harmalan, and tetrahydronorharman (tetrahydro-beta-carboline) by means of continuous intraventricular infusion. Harman and THN induced a significant preference for ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. Harman was approximately three times more potent than THN. The amount of ethanol consumed during the second and third weeks of the experimental period correlated with the harman concentration in the brain after the cessation of the treatment (p less than 0.01). Harman infusion attenuated the clomethiazole intake, whereas that of etonitazene and midazolam was not affected as compared with CSF-treated rats. By counting licking movements, it was found that the rats drank ethanol and water at distinct time periods with the pattern dependent on the concentration of the ethanol solution offered. The intervals between the maxima were 6 to 8 hours at low ethanol concentrations. Relatively high concentrations caused a disruption of the regular rhythms in favour of shorter ones with increasing intervals between the maxima (3 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr intervals). Harman treatment (27 nmol/hr) disturbed the regular rhythms at lower ethanol concentrations but mimicked the ultradian rhythm which was observed at high ethanol concentrations in CSF-treated animals. The observed coincidence of water and ethanol intake was uncoupled if the highest ethanol concentration in both treatments was offered. Thus, treatment with harman changed the rhythm of fluid intake in a direction which was detected in CSF-treated rats only at relatively high ethanol concentrations.",

Therefore, esophageal manometric evaluation of gastroesophageal sphincter function should not be preceded by administration of these drugs.", 
    "22": "Sixty-three non-agitated depressed out-patients were selected according to the Feighner-Robins-Guze criteria for primary depressions for a double-blind, between-patient randomized study for an 8 week duration. All the patients were treated with imipramine following a fixed dose schedule for the first 2 weeks and thereafter according to clinical response (100-200 mg/day). This treatment was combined with either placebo, diazepam (10 mg/day) or dixyrazine (50 mg/day). The serum concentration of imipramine both at 2 weeks and later was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the group treated with dixyrazine than in the other two groups. In the group treated with diazepam, the serum levels of imipramine and desipramine were significantly lower than in the placebo group. The serum concentrations of diazepam, desmethyldiazepam and dixyrazine were almost unchanged during the study. No significant correlation was found between the dosage and the serum concentration of imipramine or desipramine. The change in mean CPRS-score correlated neither with the imipramine nor with the desipramine serum levels, it did correlate but negatively with the degree of side effects. The degree of side effects correlated positively with the serum concentration of desipramine.",

    "24": "Two injectable forms of temazepam, in 90% propylene glycol or 40% salicylic acid, were studied in volunteers, and before surgery in healthy patients. The volunteers also received two forms (capsule and elixir) by mouth. The salicylate preparation was painful on injection and both i.v. formulations caused an unacceptably high incidence of venous thrombosis. Temazepam was detected in plasma earlier following the elixir preparation than the capsule. Plasma concentrations were similar following both injectable preparations. The potency of i.v. temazepam in inducing drowsiness in patients was much less than expected and doses greater than 0.6 mg kg-1 were required to produce adequate sedation. There was a significant reduction in thiopentone induction dose in patients receiving temazepam i.v.",

Each patient was randomly allocated to one of the four treatments. The administration was blind to the observers in theatre, recovery room and postoperative ward, who assessed each patient according to a total of 14 criteria. A modelling technique allowed account to be taken of the effects of concomitant variables (e.g. age and duration of anaesthesia) where appropriate. No statistically significant difference was found between the efficacy of the treatments. The only statistically significant differences were that temazepam was associated with more ectopic beats under anaesthesia (P = 0.03 or 0.002, depending on the test applied), more postoperative vomiting (P = 0.04) and more postoperative restlessness (P less than 0.0001).",

In anaesthetized animals, diazepam did not significantly alter the heights of peak 1 (ascorbate) or peak 3 (5-HIAA), but significantly reduced that of peak 2 (DOPAC). In freely moving rats, diazepam greatly reduced the heights of all 3 peaks. Ro 15-1788, injected 2 h after diazepam, reversed the effect of diazepam on peak 3, but not on peaks 1 and 2.", 
    "27": "The binding of different drugs to plasma proteins as well as the binding to other structures (e.g. dialysis membranes, i.v. delivery sets) is well documented and of therapeutic importance. Colloid solutions of macromolecules are widely used as plasma substitutes and plasma expanders. A possible binding of drugs to these macromolecules was investigated by means of equilibrium dialysis. Benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, cardiac glycosides, local anesthetics, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, glibenclamide, phenobarbitone and phenprocoumon (10(-7) in 50 mM tris buffer, pH 7.4) were dialyzed against tris buffer diluted (1:5) commercially available plasma substitutes consisting of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), dextran, gelatine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Binding to plasma substitutes was observed with the highest values for penbutolol and oxypolygelatine (41%), digitoxin and HES 200 (35%), phenprocoumon and PVP (43%). It is concluded that the binding of drugs to plasma substitutes is in most cases negligible and not of clinical relevance. Since some drugs seem to bind to some extent to different macromolecules this should be borne in mind and could be of some influence e.g. in perfusion experiments with isolated organs.", 
    "28": "Binding kinetics at the benzodiazepine binding site of albumin have been determined as a function of age and fatty acid concentration in serum from 32 neonates (umbilical cord blood), 28 adults aged 23-65 years and 24 adults aged 66-101 years using fluorescence-time curves obtained in a Durrum-Gibson stopped-flow apparatus and the specific marker ligand dansylsarcosine. The binding reaction can be described by a 2-step mechanism characterised by four constants: the association rate constant k2 and dissociation rate constant k-2 for the rate limiting step-2; the affinity constant KA' for the formation of an unstable intermediate complex in step-1; the affinity constant KA for the overall reaction. There were marked differences in k2 between the three groups of subjects with highest values occurring in neonates (mean: 296 s-1), intermediate values in adults aged 23-65 years (mean: 200 s-1, P less than 0.001) and lowest values in adults aged 66-101 years (mean: 144 s-1, P less than 0.001). The dissociation rate constants (k-2) averaged 18.5 s-1 overall, showed only minor changes with increasing age and corresponded to dissociation half-lives of 42 ms, 38 ms and 33 ms for neonates, adults 23-65 years and adults 66-101 years respectively. KA' in neonates and in the group of elderly subjects were lower than in adults aged 23-65 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It has been reported that benzodiazepines interact with non-depolarising neuromuscular blockers. In this study no difference was found in the effect of atracurium given with conventional fentanyl/nitrous oxide anesthesia when compared to total intravenous anesthesia using midazolam/alfentanil. More than 90% twitch depression was achieved after 123 and 137 s, respectively. Recovery time to 10% twitch height following the bolus dose was around 32 min.

    "30": "A new, highly potent antagonist of gut cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors has been examined for effects upon postprandial biliary and exocrine pancreatic secretion in conscious dogs with chronic duodenal pouches. This drug (L-364,718) markedly inhibited the postprandial increases in biliary volume, bile acid and bilirubin secretion. However, even at high p.o. doses relative to its ability to antagonize the effects of exogenous CCK, no effects were observed upon the pancreatic secretion of either fluid volume or amylase and lipase under similar conditions. In additional studies, pretreatment with L-364,718 did not significantly reverse the inhibitory effects of a fatty acid salt (sodium oleate) upon gastric emptying in gastric fistula dogs. Moreover, pretreatment with L-364,718 had no significant effects upon postprandial acid and pepsin secretion in lesser curvature (vagally innervated) pouch dogs or did it affect basal (interdigestive) gastric secretion in rats. These results suggest that endogenous CCK plays a critical physiological role in regulating postprandial biliary outflow, but not pancreatic enzyme secretion or the gastric emptying of at least liquid fatty substances. The latter two findings stand in contrast with classical views regarding the physiological function(s) of this hormone.",

Administered p.o., L-364,178 was highly potent in antagonizing cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in mice (ED50 = 38 micrograms/kg), rats (ED50 = 140 micrograms/kg) and dogs (ED50 = 91 micrograms/kg) as well as CCK-8-induced reduction in food consumption in rats (ED50 = 321 micrograms/kg). Administered i.v., L-364,718 effectively antagonized the contractile effects of CCK on the colon in rabbits (ED50 = 34 micrograms/kg) and the gallbladder in cats (ED50 = 210 micrograms/kg). Secretion of pancreatic protein and amylase elicited by CCK in cats was also antagonized by L-364,718 (ED50 less than 1.0 mg/kg i.v.). The CCK antagonism produced by L-364,718 in all species persisted for at least 2 to 5 hr. In the absence of exogenously administered CCK-8, L-364,718 per se had no effect in any of the assay systems studied, indicating a lack of CCK-like agonist properties. Specificity for CCK was demonstrated by the inability of L-364,718 (1.0-5.0 mg/kg) to antagonize either amino acid- or atropine-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in rats and dogs, respectively. L-364,718 also did not antagonize motilin-induced gallbladder contractions or secretin-induced pancreatic secretion in cats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "2,5-Dihydro-4-methyl-2-phenyl-1,5-benzothiazepine-3-carboxylic acid esters, based on the structures of dihydropyridines and diltiazem, were synthesized from o-aminothiophenol and 2-(phenylmethylene)- 3-oxobutanoic acid esters. Biological evaluation in the potassium-depolarized rabbit aorta suggests that these compounds are calcium channel blockers. The in vitro activity was further confirmed by electrophysiological techniques. Structure-activity studies for the aromatic substitution showed that the 2-nitro derivative was the most potent (IC50 = 0.3 microM) compound in vitro while the ethyl ester was slightly better than the corresponding methyl ester. Replacement of sulfur with nitrogen atom provided 2,5-dihydro-4-methyl-2-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,5-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, which was only slightly less active than the corresponding benzothiazepine. Derivatization of the nitrogen in 2,5-dihydro-4-methyl- 2-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester with a (dimethylamino)ethyl group (present in diltiazem) provided 2,5-dihydro-5-[(dimethylamino)ethyl]- 4-methyl-2-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,5-benzo-thiazepine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester, which was found to be equipotent to diltiazem in vitro. Radioligand binding studies using [3H]nitrendipine and [3H]diltiazem showed that the compound with the free nitrogen binds competitively into the dihydropyridine binding site while the molecule in which the nitrogen is alkylated with a (dimethylamino)ethyl group interacts competitively with both diltiazem and dihydropyridine binding sites. Our results therefore show that 2,5-dihydro-4-methyl-2-phenyl-1,5-benzothiazepine-3-carboxylic ester is a good starting point for designing dihydropyridine as well as diltiazem mimics.", 
    "33": "Diazepam 0.5-2.0 mg/kg per injection was self-administered intravenously by rats on a continuous reinforcement schedule in a dose-dependent manner over a 30 day period. The rates of diazepam self-administration were relatively stable after responding was established, in comparison with rats self-administering morphine 0.5 mg/kg per injection whose rates continued to increase. At a fixed ratio 4 or 8 schedule, higher maximum rates of responding were seen with diazepam than with morphine. During withdrawal, reductions in body weight tended to occur in a manner dependent on the preceding rates of diazepam self-administration and were possibly caused by physical dependence. These findings suggest that diazepam acts as an intravenous reinforcer in rats and that the procedure we describe is of use to predict the dependence liability of drugs considered to have only a weak potential for abuse.", 
    "34": "(+)-Tifluadom injected i.p. produced a biphasic response of urine output: within the first hour of its administration the drug produced antidiuresis followed by a diuretic phase. In contrast, the (-) isomer produced a modest reduction in urine output as compared to the output of the saline-treated rats. In addition, (+)-tifluadom markedly reduced the output of urinary Na+ and K+. The effects of (+)-tifluadom were blocked by 7.5 mg/kg naloxone but not by 10 mg/kg of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Parallel experiments demonstrated that the i.v. administration of (+)-tifluadom to non-anesthetized rats caused a dose-related pressor response that lasted for at least 15 min. This effect of (+)-tifluadom was blocked and antagonized by naloxone. In contrast, (-)-tifluadom was either inactive on the cardiovascular system or produced short-lasting hypotension. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, 100 micrograms/kg (+)-tifluadom caused a precipitous hypotension that was reversed by naloxone but not by Ro 15-1788.", 
    "35": "The postnatal development of susceptibility to the convulsant effects of Ro5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) was characterized in two inbred mouse strains (DBA/2J and BALB/c ByJ) which as adults differ markedly in their response to this convulsant. Onset of susceptibility to a dose of Ro5-4864 which caused a high frequency of clonic seizures in adults was observed at 10 days of age in DBA/2 mice, but not until 35 days in BALB/c By mice. At 14 days of age an abrupt increase in susceptibility to Ro5-4864-induced tonic seizures was found in DBA/2 but not BALB/c By mice. Both the peak of tonic seizure susceptibility (21 days) and the time course of its subsequent age-dependent decline closely paralleled the change in audiogenic seizure susceptibility in the DBA/2 strain. PK11195 (40 mg/kg) blocked Ro5-4864 (25 mg/kg)-induced, age-dependent tonic seizures but had no effect on clonic seizure induction in the same mice. These observations establish that both the susceptibility to Ro5-4864 in adult mice and the postnatal time course for development of susceptibility to this convulsant are inherently different in these two strains of mice. The lack of coincidence between the developmental onset of susceptibility to Ro5-4864-induced seizures and the onset of supersensitivity to Ro5-4864-induced tonic seizures during the period of peak audiogenic seizure susceptibility in DBA/2 mice implies that more than one neurochemical mechanism is involved in the ability of Ro5-4864 to induce seizures in this strain. However, the blockade of Ro5-4864-induced tonic seizures by PK11195 suggests that peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors may mediate this effect.", 
    "36": "Male adult Fischer-344 rats were given various doses of lindane (0, 15, and 30 mg/kg, po), chlordecone (0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, ip), or p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) (0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, po) and tested for their ability to perform a two-way shuttle box task or to learn and retain a step-through passive avoidance response. Administration of p,p'-DDT or chlordecone 3 hr prior to acquisition did not affect the number of shuttle box avoidance responses made during a 60-trial training task, while responses during the intertrial interval (ITI) were decreased. Rats receiving 15 or 30 mg/kg of lindane made fewer avoidance responses, but did not differ from controls in terms of the number of responses during the ITI. When 30 mg/kg lindane was given 3 hr prior to passive avoidance acquisition, retention was impaired 7 days later; the lower dose of lindane, and all doses of chlordecone or p,p'-DDT had no effect under these conditions. When these chemicals were given immediately after passive avoidance training, animals treated with lindane were not affected. Animals receiving 100 mg/kg of p,p'-DDT or chlordecone displayed marked signs of toxicity and animals tested 7 days after training showed an impaired retention. Pretreatment with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital and chlordiazepoxide, which may enhance GABA-mediated responses, blocked the disruptive effects of lindane (30 mg/kg) on shuttle box avoidance. The seizure-related activity produced by a higher dose of lindane (60 mg/kg) and kainic acid, a hippocampal excitotoxin, was also blocked by phenobarbital and chlordiazepoxide. Pretreatment with phenytoin, which is thought to bind to the inactivation gates of sodium, had no effect on the effects produced by lindane or kainic acid. These data suggest that treatment with nonconvulsant doses of lindane can interfere with the ability to acquire and use new information and that these effects may be associated with alterations in GABA.", 
    "37": "The effects of intrahippocampal injections of scopolamine and pirenzepine on muscarinic receptor binding were examined by quantitative autoradiographic techniques. Brain slices from animals which had received 7 injections of either scopolamine (n = 5) or pirenzepine (n = 5) over a 22-day injection schedule were compared with slices from 5 saline-injected controls for receptor binding to the whole slice and within selected regions of the brain as measured autoradiographically. The total number of receptors was determined from direct binding assays with 1-[3H]quinuclidinyl-benzilate ([3H]-1-QNB), while the binding of the selective ligands pirenzepine, carbamylcholine, and scopolamine was examined through inhibition studies. The data from the whole slices indicated that pirenzepine-treated animals contained more receptors for [3H]-1-QNB than either saline- or scopolamine-injected controls. Slices from the same animals also displayed a lower affinity for pirenzepine. Slices from scopolamine-injected animals revealed neither an increase in receptor number nor a decrease in antagonist affinity, although the binding of the agonist carbamylcholine was increased. Quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms generated from the slices indicated that the increase in receptor number for pirenzepine-injected animals was predominantly within the cerebral and cingulate cortices. The inhibition by pirenzepine was also lower in these areas in the same group of animals. Agonist inhibition was altered in the central layers of the cerebral cortex and in the pretectal area in scopolamine-treated animals. The results suggest separate mechanisms of drug action and adaptation for pirenzepine and scopolamine.", 
    "38": "The behavioral effects of the two muscarinic antagonists scopolamine and pirenzepine were examined using a representational memory task for rats in a T-maze. Rats were pretrained to a criterion of 100% correct responses for daily sessions of 10 paired-run trials. The training procedures eliminated all neophobic or wary responses, and response times were invariably short (less than 3 s). Following the initial training sessions, guide cannulae were surgically implanted bilaterally over the hippocampus of each animal. Following recovery from surgery, animals were injected with saline (0.5 microliter to each hippocampus), scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5 microliter of a 60 mg/ml solution (30 micrograms) to each side), or pirenzepine (0.5 microliter of a 69.1 mg/ml solution (34.6 micrograms) to each side) according to a fixed schedule. Saline injections aimed between the blades of the dorsal dentate gyrus failed to produce any change in the performance of the memory task. Initial doses of scopolamine, applied to the same area, produced a decrease in the percentage of correct responses as did the initial dose of pirenzepine. In contrast to pirenzepine, scopolamine also produced increases in response times even to the point of defaulted trials (response times greater than 90 s) in some animals following drug injections. Saline injections failed to produce significant impairments on the days following scopolamine injections, although animals receiving pirenzepine injections were still impaired on the two days immediately following the initial pirenzepine injection. Subsequent doses of pirenzepine were ineffective in producing an impairment of performance while scopolamine injections were less effective than the initial dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Motor seizures were induced by Ro 5-3663 in 156 male albino rats aged 7,12,18,25, and 90 days. Both minimal and maximal seizures could be elicited in 18-day-old and older animals, whereas only maximal seizures were induced in the two youngest groups. ECoG changes were studied in other 21 young rats. First changes induced by Ro 5-3663 were formed by isolated sharp waves in 7- and 12-day-old rats and by episodes of rhythmic activity in older animals. An imperfect form of this rhythmic activity could be seen even in 12-day-old rats. Ictal ECoG activity exhibited an increase in frequency of individual graphoelements, in generalization and in synchronization of activity among different cortical regions with maturation. Correlation between motor and ECoG phenomena was poor in 7-day-old rats and ameliorated with age but it never reached perfection. The actions of Ro 5-3663 are identical with those induced by metrazol but they differ from those elicited by bicuculline or 3-mercaptopropionic acid.", 
    "40": "Fifteen minutes after the initiation of swimming stress in the rat we observed a 50% increase in the number of [3H]RO 5-4864 binding sites in kidney and a 37% increase in the olfactory bulb, without change in affinity. The binding in heart and cerebral cortex remained unchanged after the stress. These results are discussed in relation to previous work on both the action of an acute stress in central benzodiazepine receptors and the possible modulation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors of the kidney by adrenocortical hormones.", 
    "41": "GABAA agonists stimulate 36Cl-influx in spinal cord cultured neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect of GABAA receptor stimulation is enhanced by benzodiazepines like clonazepam, diazepam and flurazepam and attenuated by (+)bicuculline and picrotoxinin. The beta-carbolines, methyl-6, 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) and propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCPr) exhibited opposite effects, with DMCM attenuating, while beta-CCPr potentiating GABA's effect. These results are consistent with the behavioral and electrophysiological effect of benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines with GABA receptor complex.", 
    "42": "The neuromuscular, cardiovascular and central nervous system stimulating effects of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), 2,4-diaminopyridine (2,4-DAP) and LF-14 were investigated in the monkey. All these compounds were shown to reverse the stable neuromuscular blockade produced by the intravenous infusion of pancuronium bromide. The doses producing 50% antagonism (ED50) of the pancuronium-induced neuromuscular block were 0.50, 0.54 and 0.71 mg/kg for LF-14, 2,4-DAP and 4-AP respectively. The compounds had only slight cardiovascular effects. In contrast to 4-AP, LF-14 and 2,4-DAP did not reduce the duration of ketamine/diazepam-induced anesthesia, suggesting minimal if any central nervous system effects of these two compounds.", 
    "43": "Using cortical cups in chloralose-urethanized rats, the in vivo release of cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity (CCK-LI) from cerebral cortex was examined. Resting levels of cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity ranged from 20 to 30 pg/20 min sample. The addition of potassium (40 mM) in excess, resulted in a highly significant elevation in the levels of CCK-LI in the cortical superfusate. Deletion of calcium and the substitution of cobalt (10 mM), resulted in a significant reduction in both resting release and the release otherwise evoked by the addition of potassium. Focal electrical stimulation of the cortex (20 Hz), resulted in a significant (1.9 +/- 0.2-fold, n = 8) increase in the levels of CCK-LI. The addition of glutamate (10(-6)-10(-4) M) of kainic acid (10(-8)-10(-6) M), also resulted in significant elevations in the levels of CCK-LI. The co-administration of a putative glutamate receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid (10(-4) M) resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of release otherwise evoked by the addition of glutamate, but not by electrical stimulation. The addition of GABA (10(-5)-10(-3) M) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the resting release of CCK-LI, and the release evoked by glutamate. Picrotoxin (10(-6)-10(-4) M), resulted in a highly significant increase in the levels of CCK-LI in the cortical effluent. These results are consistent with a tonic GABAergic inhibition of CCK-releasing neurons. The treatment of the animal with diazepam (30 mg/kg, i.p.) also resulted in a significant reduction in resting release and the release otherwise evoked by focal cortical stimulation.", 
    "44": "The effect of a single dose (5mg/kg b.w.) of diazepam on the cell proliferation in selected organs of 11-day old female Sprague-Dawley rats has been investigated. The stathmokinetic method (counting of mitoses after colchicine administration) has been used for evaluation of cell replication. The significant fall of the mitotic activity in the parietal cerebral cortex and the anterior pituitary gland was found. On the other hand, the increase of the mitotic activity in thymus was observed. The reported data, taken together with the previous observations from our and other laboratories, suggest the involvement of benzodiazepine receptor in the control of cell proliferation.", 
    "45": "A dose response curve for the phase shifting effect of triazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for the treatment of insomnia, on the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity was measured for the golden hamster. A single intraperitoneal injection of triazolam six hours before the onset of wheel-running activity induced a dose-dependent phase advance in the rhythm. A maximum phase advance, which averaged about 100 minutes, was observed in animals injected with 0.5 to 5.0 mg of triazolam. The use of drugs which promote sleep, and induce phase shifts in a central circadian clock, could be important in the treatment of sleep disorders associated with disrupted schedules and of mental and physical disorders associated with abnormal circadian rhythmicity.", 
    "46": "The time courses for development of neuronal and behavioral tolerance to diazepam (DZ) were estimated in rats continuously exposed to low levels of DZ for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Microiontophoretic sensitivity of dorsal raphe neurons to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was initially facilitated after short-term exposure to DZ released from implanted capsules for up to 3 days but returned to control levels by 7 days postimplantation and continued to decrease thereafter. GABAergic sensitivity remained depressed for a minimum of 5 days following removal of DZ capsules. To obtain a behavioral measure of tolerance, the anticonvulsant activity of DZ against bicuculline-induced seizures was also assessed. Rats studied 3 days after capsule implantation showed a significant elevation in seizure threshold. Seizure liability returned to control levels ca. 7 days after chronic treatment was initiated. These results indicate that tolerance to anticonvulsant efficacy against bicuculline seizures are temporally related to the onset of reduced GABA sensitivity on dorsal raphe neurons during prolonged exposure to DZ.", 
    "47": "Photoaffinity labeling experiments were conducted with [3H]clonazepam to investigate the possible existence of a benzodiazepine binding site that is distinct from the central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. These studies demonstrate the presence of a novel benzodiazepine binding protein in rat brain with a relative mobility of 65,000 daltons that binds benzodiazepines stereoselectivity in the high nanomolar-low micromolar concentration range.", 
    "48": "In vitro competition binding experiments with the selective muscarinic antagonists AF-DX 116 and pirenzepine (PZ) vs 3H-N-methylscopolamine as radioligand revealed a characteristic distribution of muscarinic receptor subtypes in different regions of rat brain. Based on non linear least squares analysis, the binding data were compatible with the presence of three different subtypes: the M1 receptor (high affinity for PZ), the cardiac M2 receptor (high affinity for AF-DX 116) and the glandular M2 receptor (low affinity for PZ and AF-DX 116). The highest proportion of M1 receptors was found in the hippocampus, whilst the cerebellum and the hypothalamus were the regions with the largest fraction of the cardiac M2 and glandular M2 receptors, respectively. In certain brain areas, depending on the relative proportions of the subtypes, flat binding curves were seen for AF-DX 116 and PZ. Based on these data, an approximate distribution pattern of the subtypes in the various brain regions is presented.", 
    "49": "Elevations in plasma corticosterone were shown to be a reliable indication of antagonist-precipitated withdrawal from diazepam in the rat. Dependence to the benzodiazepine was produced by a single daily injection for eight days at which time CGS-8216 was injected i.v. via a chronic indwelling catheter. This injection and subsequent serial blood samples were withdrawn from conscious, unrestrained animals that were placed previously in sound-attenuated one-way vision boxes. The magnitude of the hormone change was correlated with either the chronic dose of diazepam or the dose of the antagonist used to precipitate withdrawal. When CGS-8216 was administered chronically with the diazepam, antagonist-precipitated abstinence did not occur. Additional results showed that dependence could be produced by bilateral intracerebral placement of micropellets of diazepam into the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. These data show that dependence to diazepam can be demonstrated in a relatively short time using modest doses of drug, and, further, that exposure of the hippocampus, an area with a high concentration of benzodiazepine receptors, to diazepam will initiate dependence.", 
    "50": "A 56-year-old man developed allergic interstitial nephritis and deterioration of preexisting chronic renal failure after receiving diazepam. On discontinuation of diazepam, kidney function returned to the baseline level and itching, eosinophilia, and eosinophiluria subsided. A causative correlation between allergic interstitial nephritis and diazepam is suggested.", 
    "51": "Muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been classified into subtypes based on their high (M-1 subtype) or low (M-2 subtype) affinities for the nonclassic antagonist pirenzepine, and this classification has important experimental and therapeutic implications. Because muscarinic receptors are abundant in the airways where they mediate several different cellular responses, the goal of this study was to characterize the affinities of pirenzepine for the muscarinic receptors in bovine tracheal mucosa and smooth muscle. After isolating membrane particulates from mucosa and smooth muscle, as well as from bovine cerebral cortex (a known source of M-1 receptors), we used 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate to label muscarinic receptors in the particulates and performed competition radioligand binding assays in the presence of either atropine or pirenzepine. Receptors from all 3 tissues (mucosa, smooth muscle, and cerebral cortex) were of a relatively uniform affinity for atropine (range of KI values: 0.8 +/- 0.4 X 10(-9) to 2.4 +/- 1.7 X 10(-9) M), as would be predicted for this classic muscarinic antagonist. By contrast, affinities for pirenzepine differed depending on the tissue. In cerebral cortex, the majority of receptors were of high affinity for pirenzepine (KI = 1.8 +/- 1.4 X 10(-8) M). In both mucosa and smooth muscle, receptors were of low affinity for pirenzepine (Kl = 4.8 +/- 0.4 to 6.9 +/- 3.8 X 10(-7) M). We conclude that muscarinic cholinergic receptors in bovine tracheal mucosa and smooth muscle are predominantly of the M-2 subtype.", 
    "52": "Alprazolam treatment was tapered in 17 panic patients at a rate of 10% of the starting dose every 3 days. Only four subjects completed withdrawal on schedule (4-5 weeks); four additional subjects discontinued treatment in 7-13 weeks. During withdrawal 15 patients had recurrent or increased panic attacks and nine had significant new withdrawal symptoms. Most common among the latter were malaise, weakness, insomnia, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and dizziness. None had seizures, psychosis, or significant neurological or EEG abnormalities. Results indicate that relapse and withdrawal are important considerations in the choice of alprazolam treatment for panic attacks.", 
    "53": "Fourteen patients with marked kinetic tremors of long duration but no other major neurologic signs are described. A positive family history of essential tremor, mild postural tremor, and tremor suppression with alcohol suggest that the condition is a variant of essential tremor. Kinetic tremors had a frequency of 3.5 to 6.0 Hz and an alternating EMG pattern. Propranolol caused improvement in some patients, but clonazepam treatment resulted in tremor suppression in all patients. Kinetic tremor without cerebellar signs is a subtype of essential tremor with pharmacologic responsiveness to clonazepam.", 
    "54": "A patient developed manic symptoms during treatment with alprazolam. These symptoms remitted upon discontinuation of treatment, but reemerged during a second trial with alprazolam. Subsequent administration of an equivalent dosage of lorazepam did not induce manic symptoms. The clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms of action of alprazolam, a novel benzodiazepine.", 
    "55": "Systemic administration of platelet activating factor (PAF; acetyl glyceryl ether phosphorylcholine) reduces renal blood flow, but the mechanism responsible for that effect has not been defined. To address that problem, we determined the effects on renal blood flow of PAF administered directly into the renal artery in pentobarbital (30 mg/kg)-anesthetized dogs. Bolus injections of PAF (0.2-0.8 microgram) caused transient renal vasoconstriction, reducing renal blood flow by 20 to 60% without altering systemic blood pressure; lyso-PAF (1 microgram) had no effect. The effects of PAF on renal blood flow were not altered by alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine, 3 mg/kg) or by angiotensin II receptor blockade ([Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II, 6 micrograms/kg/min), but they were increased in magnitude and duration by meclofenamate (5 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Methysergide (3 mg/kg), a serotonin antagonist, slightly reduced PAF effects, but a specific blocker of vascular serotonin receptors did not. Renal venous plasma platelet density was not altered by infusion of PAF into the renal artery at a dose (1-2 micrograms/min) that caused a sustained 20% renal blood flow decrease. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine that competitively inhibited PAF-induced aggregation in canine platelet-rich plasma, also inhibited the renal vasoconstrictor action of PAF (0.8 mg/min, into the renal artery) but did not alter renal vasoconstrictor effects of norepinephrine or angiotensin II.", 
    "56": "We conducted a study to evaluate the absorption of endotracheally administered diazepam and the pulmonary pathologic changes induced by its administration. Six cats received diazepam and five cats received saline endotracheally. Serial blood gases and serum diazepam levels were drawn at intervals for 90 minutes after the administration of diazepam. The cats were sacrificed after two days and their lungs were examined by a pathologist. Mean diazepam levels reached a peak two minutes after the administration of diazepam and remained elevated above therapeutic levels for 90 minutes. There was no significant change in pH, PO2, or PCO2 for either group. Histologic examination of the lungs showed a significantly increased incidence of pneumonitis in the diazepam group as compared to the saline group. This study demonstrates that although diazepam is well absorbed when administered endotracheally, it has adverse effects on the lungs that may preclude endotracheal use in the currently available commercial form.", 
    "57": "Higher-tier tests for the assessment of early treatment effects should be aimed at providing specific information on the behavior processes affected, rather than simply at extending the descriptive data base. The contrast between positive and negative results can be useful to point out possible mechanisms of action. For example, late prenatal oxazepam exposure of mice produced a reduction of the amphetamine hyperactivity at the end of the second postnatal week, but did not significantly affect the response to scopolamine at the end of the third week. An impairment of active locomotor avoidance was observed at the young adult stage, which contrasted with the absence or scarcity of changes in passive avoidance and extinction responding in the same go-no go tests. These changes in response-activating mechanisms appear to be in agreement with the medium- and long-term effects on CNS monoamine metabolism described in the literature. As concerns statistical analysis, dichotomous or polytomous data obtained, e.g., by the Fox battery are not yet amenable to an adequate processing, due to the shortcomings of the available nonparametric tests. By contrast, mixed-model ANOVAs can cope with complex data obtained, e.g., in activity and learning tests. However, the available checks on various assumptions (normality, homogeneity of variance, sphericity) are not valid when nested factors, block factors and repeated measures coexist. Finally, the more usual cross-fostering procedures provide adequate information on some aspects (e.g., separation of main effects of prenatal treatments from postnatal maternal effects) but not on others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "Cholinergic receptor blockade has been shown to abolish GH secretion in a variety of physiological and pharmacological situations in normal subjects. We have investigated the effect of pirenzepine on nocturnal GH secretion in young adult patients with Type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Five patients (three male, two female; aged 20-27 years) were studied in a randomized order on two days separated by at least 1 week. All patients showed episodes of slow wave sleep on each occasion and this was followed by peaks of GH release when placebo alone was administered (range of GH peaks 6-115 mU/l). In contrast, cholinergic muscarinic receptor blockade with pirenzepine (100 mg orally at 2200 and 2400 h) completely abolished nocturnal GH release in each individual without altering the occurrence of slow wave sleep itself. Mean plasma glucose levels at each sampling time between each study did not differ significantly. The ability to abolish nocturnal GH secretion may be important in the field of diabetes, since excess GH secretion is implicated in several acute metabolic and chronic microvascular complications of the disease.", 
    "59": "Ninety patients presented for elective surgery and were randomly divided into three groups and studied on a double-blind basis to assess the efficacy of gastrozepin, a new muscarinic receptor antagonist, compared to cimetidine and placebo. Gastrozepin 10 mg, cimetidine 200 mg and a placebo were given i.v. on average 90 min prior to surgery. Gastric fluid was aspirated immediately after induction of anaesthesia and the volume and pH measured. The mean gastric fluid volume in the placebo group (19.73 ml) was significantly (P less than 0.02) greater than the mean volume of either the gastrozepin group (12.40 ml) or cimetidine group (12.72 ml). Mean gastric pH's were 4.83 (gastrozepin), 6.39 (cimetidine) and 3.21 (placebo) and each of these means differed significantly from the other two (P less than 0.001). However, the number of patients who had a gastric juice volume of more than 25 ml and a pH of less than 2.5 in each of the three groups: gastrozepin, cimetidine and placebo, were 1, 0, and 8, respectively.", 
    "60": "Many patients fear being awake in the operating room, and the acceptance of regional anesthesia is often made dependent on the promise of adequate sedation. With the introduction of the short-acting benzodiazepine (bzdp) midazolam, it seemed possible to achieve induction and maintainance of sleep throughout an operative procedure. This substance may, however, occasionally result in a \"paradoxical reaction\" (PR) characterized by agitated excitement, mental confusion, and uncooperativeness. We have treated this condition successfully with physostigmine, as documented here in two case reports where a possible interaction between promethazine and midazolam may have been responsible for the PR. The symptoms resemble some of those seen in the central anticholinergic syndrome, as further implied by the therapeutic effect of physostigmine, but an etiological difference may exist. A direct anticholinergic effect of bzdp's is described only following excessive doses. An indirect effect may result from the impact on GABA-receptors, which have been identified as structurally related to the bzdp receptors. Physostigmine itself is not bound at the bzdp receptor, but has been shown to block the binding of bzdp's to their receptors and to reverse sedation from midazolam, perhaps through an indirect stimulatory effect. Previous case reports have indicated the effect of physostigmine in reversing PR following various bzdp's. Without treatment, a PR during regional anesthesia frequently makes general anesthesia necessary in order to immobilize the patient sufficiently to make surgery possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a recently developed, noninvasive technique of increasing importance in pediatric diagnosis. In newborns and very young infants problems may arise with regard to adequate sedation and sufficient patient monitoring during NMR imaging. In 44 of 46 young pediatric patients sedation with oral promazine or rectal diazepam/intravenous ketamine provided good immobilization during NMR scanning. In two patients an additional drug was necessary in order to successfully complete the NMR procedure. Satisfactory monitoring of patients' respiratory motions was obtained by means of a simple optical system. Good cardiovascular monitoring was made possible by lengthening the rubber tubing of a blood pressure cuff. No complications were observed during the NMR-procedures.", 
    "62": "The triazolodiazepines brotizolam, triazolam and alprazolam inhibited PAF-induced human platelet aggregation in vitro (IC50 = 0.54, 7.6 and 13.7 microM, respectively) but showed only a weak or no effect against other aggregating agents (ADP, adrenaline, collagen, serotonin, arachidonic acid). In comparison, flunitrazepam and diazepam, two diazepines without the triazole ring, showed IC50-values of 42 and 260 microM, respectively. Flunitrazepam does not possess the specificity shown by the other compounds. Brotizolam and triazolam also inhibited PAF-induced human neutrophil aggregation in vitro, with IC50-values 0.21 and 6.6 microM, respectively. In anesthetized guinea pigs, brotizolam (2.5 to 10 mg/kg p.o. or 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg i.v.) or triazolam (20 to 100 mg/kg p.o.) inhibited dose-dependently the intrathoracic accumulation and aggregation of 111Indium labelled platelets induced by an i.v. infusion of PAF (30 ng/kg X min). Brotizolam at doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg p.o. and 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg i.v. inhibited dose-dependently the reduction in tidal volume (bronchoconstriction), the systemic hypotension and the lethal effect due to i.v. PAF in guinea pigs. Triazolam inhibited these effects of PAF at doses of 50 to 200 mg/kg p.o. PAF-induced systemic hypotension in rats can be reversed by cumulative i.v. doses (0.05 to 1.0 mg/kg) of brotizolam. In conclusion, these results show that triazolodiazepines, like brotizolam and triazolam, are potent inhibitors of PAF-induced effects in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "63": "Inter-individual variation in drug serum protein binding was studied in healthy dogs and in dogs with inflammatory diseases for lidocaine, oxprenolol and propranolol, which bind mainly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP), and for diazepam, digitoxin and phenytoin, which bind mainly to albumin. For the drugs mostly bound to alpha 1-AGP, in both groups of dogs binding varied considerably, and it was markedly higher in dogs with inflammatory disease. For the other drugs, the variation in binding was smaller and did not differ between the two groups of dogs. In both groups of dogs, the alpha 1-AGP concentration varied widely; it was higher in the serum of the dogs with inflammation, while the concentration of albumin was lower in these animals. There was a significant negative correlation between percentage free lidocaine, oxprenolol or propranolol and alpha 1-AGP concentration, suggesting that the inter-individual variation in binding of these drugs is due to the variation in alpha 1-AGP concentration. There was a marked intra-individual variation in lidocaine binding and in serum alpha 1-AGP concentration, studied over a period of 3 weeks in healthy dogs; a significant negative correlation between percentage free lidocaine and alpha 1-AGP concentration was obtained.", 
    "64": "The factors that affect M/P (milk-to-plasma) ratios of several compounds were assessed in vitro using samples collected from four healthy lactating women. Three drugs were studied: diazepam, phenytoin, and propranolol. Serum and skim milk protein binding were determined by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C. Skim-to-whole milk concentration ratios (S/M) were determined after incubation of whole milk at 37 degrees C for 1 h. Free fractions in serum and skim milk, respectively, were 0.013 and 0.334 for diazepam, 0.142 and 0.584 for phenytoin, and 0.107 and 0.699 for propranolol. The S/M values were 0.220, 0.727, and 0.610 for diazepam, phenytoin, and propranolol, respectively. An equation was derived which relates M/P to milk and plasma pH, unbound fractions of drug in skim milk and serum, and S/M. The M/P ratios calculated from in vitro data agreed with published in vivo M/P ratios. The results indicated that milk protein binding and fat partitioning can make a substantial contribution in determining M/P, and predictions of M/P made without considering these factors may be misleading.", 
    "65": "Based on the swimming test according to Kiplinger, in experiments on (CBA X C57BL)F1 mice there were elaborated criteria for animal performance evaluation in the process of repeated swimming of a standard distance thus measuring power, volume of work and rate of the fatigue development in relative units. From the study of effects of sydnocarb, bemethyl and phenazepam on various parameters of physical performance of mice a conclusion was made that the proposed method provides a more informative evaluation of the pharmacological effect on physical performance of animals as compared to the methods based on the record of time of performing the load.", 
    "66": "CGS 9896, a non-sedating anxiolytic, was compared to diazepam with respect to the development of tolerance and withdrawal. Both compounds were administered daily to mice at various doses (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg) for periods of up to 4 weeks. Measures of sedation/muscle relaxation, motor activity and anticonvulsant effects were then assessed. When administered acutely, CGS 9896 increased motor activity, had no effect on traction reflex, and elevated the threshold for PTZ-induced convulsions. After chronic administration of CGS 9896, no changes in these parameters were observed compared to the effects seen after acute treatment. Acute administration of diazepam reduced motor activity, impaired traction reflex and increased PTZ-induced convulsion threshold. Tolerance developed to the effects of diazepam in all three measures. Following a four week dosing period with 30 mg/kg of either CGS 9896 or diazepam, the drugs were withdrawn and similar behavioral measures obtained at various withdrawal intervals up to 15 days. In separate groups of mice, precipitated withdrawal was also assessed by the administration of the benzodiazepine agonist, CGS 8216. No effects were observed after any period of withdrawal from CGS 9896. By contrast, withdrawal from diazepam resulted in significant alterations of motor activity and convulsion threshold. These results indicate that CGS 9896 is likely to be free of undesirable tolerance and withdrawal effects typically associated with the benzodiazepines.", 
    "67": "Lactating female rats vigorously attack equally sized conspecific males introduced into their home cage. Under conditions of such high aggression, the previously reported pro-aggressive action of a low (5 mg/kg) dosage of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) is hardly detectable. When opponents are large, the intensity of the aggression is less than what is seen with small ones. In this situation treatment of the females with CDP increases aggression levels substantially. The importance of intruders evoking aggression was further investigated by treating different sized opponents with d-amphetamine. d-Amphetamine treatment did not lead to major changes in the defensive capacities of either types of intruder. The data demonstrate that drug effects, such as pro-aggressive actions, may be observed using larger sized opponents that are not so easily defeated and show more adequate defense than small ones. The subtleness of the dyadic interactions in maternal aggression indicates that drug effects should be considered carefully before extrapolation to other conditions.", 
    "68": "Intraperitoneal injections of chlordiazepoxide in rats attenuated the severity of stomach ulcers induced by a single restraint session. However, when the drug was withheld during the last session of a series of repeated restraint treatments, stomach erosions developed in the animals. Vehicle-controls, on the other hand, had adapted to the chronic stress, as indexed by a decline in gastric pathology. The results were discussed in reference to stress adaptation and drug withdrawal effects.", 
    "69": "A method of analyzing drugs on the Toxi-Lab thin-layer chromatographic system by solid substrate room-temperature luminescence is described. Three pairs of unresolved drugs: quinine/cimetidine, caffeine/chlordiazepoxide, and phenazopyridine/lidocaine, were studied as model compounds. Their luminescence characteristics were obtained and calibration curves were found to be linear over two orders of magnitude. The effect of the nonluminescent component of each pair on the determination of the luminescent component was found to be negligible. Statistical F-tests showed that the observed differences in the slopes and intercepts of the calibration curves were due to random errors. The method was evaluated by determining quinine in urine samples at the ng level.", 
    "70": "A simple, sensitive, and rapid method for analysis of clonazepam in blood by gas-liquid chromatography with electron-capture detection is described. The method employs neutral benzene extraction from plasma and concentration into a small volume for autoinjection into the electron capture detector-equipped chromatograph. This method consistently provides blank plasma samples free of contaminants in the areas corresponding to the retention times for clonazepam and desmethylflunitrazepam (the internal standard). Sensitivity is 1 ng/mL, and standard curves are linear from 1 to 200 ng/mL. The applicability of the method to single-dose pharmacokinetics is illustrated.", 
    "71": "Recent reports have supported the innovative use of clonazepam in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions. This report alerts clinicians that, although helpful in some patients, clonazepam can cause behavioral disinhibition and worsening of symptoms in other patients.", 
    "72": "A psychotropic drug monitoring study in general practice was carried out in 1983 and 1984 using a computerized drug information system. The prescription data analysed in the study came from 68 general practitioners operating in south Verona and have been collected by 14 community pharmacies located in the same area. Benzodiazepine hypnotics were the most commonly prescribed drugs, followed by antidepressants and neuroleptics both in 1983 and in 1984. The distribution of the general practitioners in terms of low, medium and high prescribers was examined by analysing the rates of prescriptions per registered patient. The rates were obtained for the total number of prescriptions and also for each of the three different classes of psychotropic drug. The proportion of low and high prescribers decreased from 1983 to 1984 (18.3 versus 11.7 and 26.7 versus 16.7 for low and high prescribers respectively); this change was mainly due to the reduction in benzodiazepine prescriptions. No significant correlation was found between the rates of psychotropic drug prescriptions and list size. The monthly variation in prescription of the three drug classes followed a similar pattern during the two years; the fluctuations were clearly cyclical, more definitely in 1984 than in 1983 where the most relevant feature was the summer trough.", 
    "73": "The effect of cimetidine on the single dose pharmacokinetics of orally administered clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam (NDMC) was studied in volunteers. Cimetidine inhibited the elimination of both clobazam and NDMC and inhibited the rate of formation of NDMC from clobazam. The increase in the AUC for NDMC generated from clobazam was relatively greater than that for clobazam itself. This suggests that NDMC elimination is inhibited to a relatively greater extent than clobazam elimination. The increase in AUC for NDMC generated from clobazam was also relatively greater than that for NDMC administered orally. This would suggest that cimetidine either increases the bioavailability of clobazam or reduces that of NDMC. The increases in the AUC for NDMC and for clobazam in some individuals was of a magnitude which is likely to be clinically significant.", 
    "74": "Nine patients were given intrathecal injections of midazolam (dose 0.3-2 mg dissolved in 3 ml 5% dextrose). No changes in motor power or general sensation were produced. Resting heart rate and blood pressure were unchanged and normal valsalva manoeuvres were elicited 30 min post-injection. Cardiovascular responses were provoked at a light plane of anaesthesia by intubation of the trachea and manipulation of peritoneum and bowel but not by surgical incision of the skin. Intrathecal administration of midazolam relieved post-operative pain of somatic origin but not of visceral origin. It is concluded that intrathecal midazolam in the dosage used interrupts somatic nociceptive afferent pathways but not abdominal visceral nociceptive afferent pathways.", 
    "75": "This study aimed not only to compare the pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous doses of the new water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, but also to study the effects on haemodynamics, sensorium, and memory performance. Eight normal human volunteers each received a single 15 mg dose of midazolam base orally and intravenously in randomized sequence 2 weeks apart. Serial venous samples were obtained for 12 h after dosing. Vital signs, sensorium testing and memory testing using word lists were also performed. Computerized non-linear least squares curve-fitting of the two-compartment open model to the oral and intravenous data simultaneously yielded the following estimates: V1, 0.33 1 kg-1, VdSS, 1.08 1 kg-1, t1/2,lambda, 0.10 h, t1/2,Z, 1.89 h, ka 1.17 h-1 and bioavailability, 49%. The intravenous dose decreased the systolic pressure 22 mm Hg during the first half-hour and the oral dose had 50% less effect. Most subjects became drowsy halfway through the infusion and were only rousable to voice by its end. The sensorium was clear by 2-3 h. After oral dosing the peak sensorium effects of ataxia-dysarthria were seen at 30 min and had cleared by 2 h. Memory testing showed that memory acquisition was markedly impaired for at least 90 min after the intravenous dose and slight recovery was apparent at this time after the oral dose. Memory performance was proportionately more impaired than the sensorium score. We conclude that: midazolam kinetics are characterized by rapid absorption, but incomplete bioavailability and rapid elimination, midazolam intravenously may lower blood pressure significantly, and the level of consciousness correlates poorly with the degree of memory impairment."
