Lorazepam, alprazolam, and lormetazepam were the most prescribed drugs. Lorazepam was more frequently used by males, consumed for a long period, in pills, and prescribed for anxiety. Lormetazepam was more frequently consumed by females with a high school education, having a psychiatric disorder, taken in drops and prescribed for insomnia. Lormetazepam had the highest DDD.",

    "9": "The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), has received significant attention both as a diagnostic biomarker and as a therapeutic target for different neuronal disease pathologies. Recently, its functional basis believed to be mediating mitochondrial cholesterol import for steroid hormone production has been refuted by studies examining both in vivo and in vitro genetic Tspo-deficient models. As a result, there now exists a fundamental gap in the understanding of TSPO function in the nervous system, and its putative pharmacology in neurosteroid production. In this review, we discuss several recent findings in steroidogenic cells that are in direct contradiction to previous studies, and necessitate a re-examination of the purported role for TSPO in de novo neurosteroid biosynthesis. We critically examine the pharmacological effects of different TSPO-binding drugs with particular focus on studies that measure neurosteroid levels. We highlight the basis of key misconceptions regarding TSPO that continue to pervade the literature, and the need for interpretation with caution to avoid negative impacts. We also summarize the emerging perspectives that point to new directions that need to be investigated for understanding the molecular function of TSPO, only after which the true potential of this therapeutic target in medicine may be realized.", 
    "10": "In South Florida, there has been a highly addictive new synthetic drug flooding the streets for people looking for a cheap high. Alpha-PVP, better known as Flakka, is an illegal substance that sells on the streets for as little as $5 a hit and delivers an instant high that can last from hours to days with lingering effects for weeks after it has been ingested. Although people use Flakka for its potential euphoric high, symptoms are known to easily escalate into frightening delusions, paranoid psychosis, extreme agitation, and a multitude of other altered mental states. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Florida appears to be the nation's hot spot for reports of Flakka. In this case report, a 17-year-old female with no prior psychiatric diagnosis presents to the hospital under a 72-hour involuntary placement for altered mental status with agitation and psychotic behaviors. After multiple days of symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, the patient became coherent enough to give a history of a \"friend\" putting Flakka in her food at school as a joke. Although she continues to have residual symptoms including psychomotor agitation and slowing of cognition, she was alert, oriented, and able to be discharged home with proper follow-up.",

Among those that passed a first level of scrutiny, two of seven drug-outcome pairs for which there were plausible research designs had anomalous results. The use of benzodiazepines was unexpectedly associated with acute renal failure and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We chose the latter as an example for in-depth study. The factitious appearance of a bleeding risk may have been partly driven by an excess of procedures on the first day of treatment. A risk window definition that excluded the first day largely removed the spurious association.",

Usually, measurements are performed in blood, but because of postmortem redistribution phenomena this may not be optimal. Rather, measurement in the target organ of psychoactive drugs, the brain, might be considered. Here we present reference concentrations of femoral blood and brain tissue of selected benzodiazepines (BZDs). Using LC-MS/MS, we quantified alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and the metabolites desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam in postmortem femoral blood and brain tissue in 104 cases. BZDs were judged to be unrelated to the cause of death in 88 cases and contributing to death in 16 cases. No cases were found with cause of death solely attributed to BZD poisoning. All BZDs investigated tended to have higher concentrations in brain than in blood with median brain-blood ratios ranging from 1.1 to 2.3. A positive correlation between brain and blood concentrations was found with R(2) values from 0.51 to 0.95. Our reported femoral blood concentrations concur with literature values, but sparse information on brain concentration was available. Drug-metabolite ratios were similar in brain and blood for most compounds. Duplicate measurements of brain samples showed that the pre-analytical variation in brain (5.9%) was relatively low, supporting the notion that brain tissue is a suitable postmortem specimen. The reported concentrations in both brain and blood can be used as reference values when evaluating postmortem cases.",

It was found that all the drugs modified to a greater or lesser extent some components of the model operator activity. Isoprenaline and phenazepam had the most negative effect on the psychophysiological indicators and quality of the modeled operator activity. The results should be considered before administration of such drugs to working operators.",

In addition, compared with patients without a dual diagnosis, patients with dual pathology were significantly older, used benzodiazepines and cannabis in significantly greater percentages, and showed significantly more frequent infectious and non-infectious comorbidities, worse overall working status, a lower proportion of drivers and higher levels of severity regarding medical, employment, alcohol, legal, family and psychological issues. Therefore, the data showed a very high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in opioid-dependent patients receiving OAT in Spain and several problems frequently associated with patients with dual diagnosis.

The clinical features were consistent with a severe sympathomimetic toxidrome. The results further demonstrated that \u03b1-PVP prevailed as a drug of abuse after being classified as a narcotic substance, and despite a high incidence of severe poisonings and fatalities. However, the low prevalence of \u03b1-PVP cases registered at the PIC suggested that many were unaware of the actual substance they had taken.",

Many frequent clinical problems recorded in electronic patient records may indicate an increased risk for alcohol related health problems. The hazard ratios were modest and the resulting predictive model was unsatisfactory for diagnostic purposes. If we accepted a sensitivity as low as 0.50, the specificity slightly exceeded 0.75. With a low prevalent condition, it is obvious that the false positive problem will be vast.

An hour after administration, assessment of its sedative (open-field and rota-rod tests) and sleep-potentiating effects (pentobarbital-induced sleeping test and EEG monitoring) were conducted. Although a trend can be observed, CH treatment did not significantly alter the spontaneous locomotor activity and motor function of mice in the open-field and rota-rod tests. On the other hand, CH (150mg/kg, respectively) enhanced the sleep induced by pentobarbital sodium in mice. It also promoted slow-wave (delta) EEG activity in rats; a pattern indicative of sleep or relaxation. These behavioral results indicate that CH has sleep-promoting effects, but no or has minimal sedative effects. To elucidate the probable mechanism behind the effects of CH, we examined its action on intracellular chloride ion influx in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. CH dose-dependently increased chloride ion influx, which was blocked by co-administration of bicuculline, a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that CH has sleep-promoting properties which are probably mediated through the GABAA receptor-chloride ion channel complex.", 
    "69": "Chronic benzodiazepine use is common in patients with mental illness and is associated with cognitive impairment. It is unclear whether benzodiazepine-induced cognitive impairment is reversible. Amelioration of cognitive dysfunction may be facilitated during benzodiazepine tapering by add-on melatonin due to its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. We examined how melatonin and benzodiazepine withdrawal affect cognition, subjective well-being, and psychosocial functioning. Eighty patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were randomized to add-on treatment once daily with either prolonged-release melatonin or placebo in a 24-week, double-blind clinical trial. All participants gradually tapered usual benzodiazepine dosage in a closely monitored treatment setting. We used the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) to assess neurocognitive performance with additional assessments of subjective well-being and psychosocial functioning. BACS composite and subscale scores (except motor speed) significantly improved in parallel with benzodiazepine dose reduction, but there was no additional effect of melatonin. Cognitive performance was still markedly impaired post-tapering compared with normative data. Neither benzodiazepine withdrawal nor treatment group affected subjective well-being or psychosocial functioning. In conclusion, add-on melatonin does not seem to affect cognition, well-being, or psychosocial functioning in patients with severe mental illness. The observed improvement in cognitive performance could not be distinguished from retest effects, which may in turn have been facilitated by the benzodiazepine tapering.",

A higher proportion of women (42%) than men (31%) filled potentially inappropriate prescriptions. The highest rates of prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications were among women aged 85 or more (47%). Benzodiazepines and other hypnotics were the leading contributors to the overall frequency of and sex differences in prescribing of potentially inappropriate drugs among older adults.

    "81": "Epileptic seizure emergencies are life-threatening conditions, which in their most severe form, status epilepticus, have a high mortality rate if not quickly terminated. Treatment requires rapid delivery of anti-epileptics such as benzodiazepines to the brain. The nasal route is attractive due to its non-invasiveness, potential for direct nose to brain delivery, high vascularity, relatively large absorptive surface area, and avoidance of intestinal/liver metabolism. However, the limited volume of the nasal cavity and poor water solubility of anti-epileptics restrict absorption, leading to insufficient therapeutic brain levels. This review covers various formulation approaches adopted to improve nasal delivery of drugs, especially benzodiazepines, used to treat seizure emergencies. Other general topics such as nasal anatomy, challenges to nasal delivery, and drug/formulation considerations for nose to brain delivery are also discussed.",

    "86": "Data from genetically modified mice suggest that benzodiazepine (BDZ)-site agonists with improved selectivity for \u03b12-subtype GABAA receptors (\u03b12GABAAR) are potentially useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Subtype-selective compounds available for preclinical tests in rodents support this concept but have not been approved for human use, hindering proof-of-concept studies in patients. We recently proposed that N-desmethyl clobazam (NDMC), the main metabolite of the licensed BDZ clobazam (CBZ), is responsible for most of the antihyperalgesia observed in mice after CBZ administration. In order to assess a potentially favorable pharmacological profile of NDMC, we analyzed differences in the GABAAR subtype specificity of CBZ, NDMC and diazepam (DZP) in recombinant receptors. DZP and CBZ potentiated sedating \u03b11GABAARs and antihyperalgesic \u03b12GABAARs with similar efficacies, whereas NDMC preferred \u03b12GABAARs over \u03b11GABAARs across a wide concentration range. In\u00a0vivo, DZP and NDMC reduced neuropathic pain at doses between 3 and 30\u00a0mg/kg. At these doses, DZP had strong locomotor sedating effects while NDMC caused no or only weak sedation. Sedative effects of NDMC became apparent when the action of NDMC was restricted to \u03b11GABAARs. However, when GABAAR point-mutated mice were studied that allow the analysis of antihyperalgesia and sedation in isolation, we found that, compared to DZP, NDMC had a significantly improved therapeutic window, consistent with its more favorable \u03b12/\u03b11 in\u00a0vitro activity ratio. Given that NDMC should share the safety profile of its parent compound CBZ, it should be well-suited for proof-of-concept studies in human volunteers or patients.", 
    "87": "Cholinergic status epilepticus (CSE) quickly becomes self-sustaining, independent of its initial trigger, and resistant to benzodiazepines and other antiepileptic drugs. We review a few of the many physiological changes associated with CSE, with an emphasis on receptor trafficking. Time-dependent internalization of synaptic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors explains, in part, the loss of inhibition and the loss of response to benzodiazepines in the early stages of CSE. The increase in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors may contribute to the runaway excitation and excitotoxicity of CSE. These changes have therapeutic implications. The time-dependent increase in maladaptive changes points to the importance of early treatment. The involvement of both inhibitory and excitatory systems challenges current therapeutic guidelines, which recommend treating only one system, and questions the rationale for monotherapy. It suggests that polytherapy may be needed, especially when treatment is delayed, so that drugs can only reach a much reduced number of GABAA receptors. Finally, it raises the possibility that the current practice of waiting for one treatment to fail before starting the next drug may need to be reevaluated.",

Exceptions to the main algorithm for special patient populations, such as women of childbearing potential, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with common medical and psychiatric comorbidities, were considered. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are still the basic first-line medication. Early alternatives include duloxetine, buspirone, hydroxyzine, pregabalin, or bupropion, in that order. If response is inadequate, then the second recommendation is to try a different SSRI. Additional alternatives now include benzodiazepines, venlafaxine, kava, and agomelatine. If the response to the second SSRI is unsatisfactory, then the recommendation is to try a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Other alternatives to SSRIs and SNRIs for treatment-resistant or treatment-intolerant patients include tricyclic antidepressants, second-generation antipsychotics, and valproate.

    "130": "Soil-water partition coefficient normalized to the organic carbon content (KOC) is one of the crucial properties influencing the fate of organic compounds in the environment. Chromatographic methods are well established alternative for direct sorption techniques used for KOC determination. The present work proposes reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (RP-TLC) as a simpler, yet equally accurate method as officially recommended HPLC technique. Several TLC systems were studied including octadecyl-(RP18) and cyano-(CN) modified silica layers in combination with methanol-water and acetonitrile-water mixtures as mobile phases. In total 50 compounds of different molecular shape, size, and various ability to establish specific interactions were selected (phenols, beznodiazepines, triazine herbicides, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons). Calibration set of 29 compounds with known logKOC values determined by sorption experiments was used to build simple univariate calibrations, Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) models between logKOC and TLC retention parameters. Models exhibit good statistical performance, indicating that CN-layers contribute better to logKOC modeling than RP18-silica. The most promising TLC methods, officially recommended HPLC method, and four in silico estimation approaches have been compared by non-parametric Sum of Ranking Differences approach (SRD). The best estimations of logKOC values were achieved by simple univariate calibration of TLC retention data involving CN-silica layers and moderate content of methanol (40-50%v/v). They were ranked far well compared to the officially recommended HPLC method which was ranked in the middle. The worst estimates have been obtained from in silico computations based on octanol-water partition coefficient. Linear Solvation Energy Relationship study revealed that increased polarity of CN-layers over RP18 in combination with methanol-water mixtures is the key to better modeling of logKOC through significant diminishing of dipolar and proton accepting influence of the mobile phase as well as enhancing molar refractivity in excess of the chromatographic systems.",

    "132": "Despite decades of research with humans, the biological mechanisms that motivate an individual to help others remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality. To determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats receiving midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, were tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping. The corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats' subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior. Finally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing. A novel analytical tool was designed to interrogate the pattern of door-opening for signs that a rat's behavior on one session influenced his behavior on the next session. Results suggest that helping a trapped rat has a greater motivational value than does chocolate. In sum, this series of experiments clearly demonstrates the fundamental role of affect in motivating pro-social behavior in rodents and the need for a helper to resonate with the affect of a victim.",

As a consequence, the routine immunoassay drug testing for benzodiazepines may become less effective, due to an increased occurrence of 'false negative' and 'false positive' results. This work aimed to extend the knowledge of analytical cross-reactivity of 13 designer benzodiazepines in the CEDIA, EMIT II Plus, HEIA, and KIMS II immunoassays. Urine standards were prepared by spiking blank urine with clonazolam, deschloroetizolam, diclazepam, estazolam, etizolam, flubromazepam, flubromazolam, flutazolam, 3-hydroxyphenazepam, meclonazepam, nifoxipam, phenazepam, and pyrazolam. Authentic urine samples from intoxication cases identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were also investigated. For the spiked standard samples, the 13 designer benzodiazepines generally showed a high cross-reactivity in all assays. This was further confirmed when investigating their detectability in authentic urine samples from cases of drug intake. The test responses also indicated additional reactivity from metabolites. The lowest detectability in spiked samples was observed for flutazolam, which shows the most divergent chemical structure compared with the other benzodiazepines. Overall, the KIMS II and CEDIA immunoassays, which both include enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated forms, showed the highest, and EMIT II Plus the lowest degree of reactivity, for spiked parent substances and authentic urine specimens. The results of this study demonstrated that designer benzodiazepines can be detected in standard urine immunoassay drug screening and this should be taken into consideration when performing confirmation analysis.

    "159": "Diazepam is well known for its anxiolytic properties, which are mediated via activation of the GABAA receptor. Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI), also called acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), is a ubiquitously expressed protein originally identified based on its ability to displace diazepam from its binding site on the GABAA receptor. Central administration of ACBP or its cleaved fragment, commonly referred to as endozepines, induces proconflict and anxiety-like behaviour in rodents. For this reason, ACBP is known as an anxiogenic peptide. However, the role of endogenous ACBP in anxiety-like behaviour and anxiolytic responses to diazepam has not been investigated. To address this question, we assessed anxiety behaviour and anxiolytic responses to diazepam in two complementary loss-of-function mouse models including astrocyte-specific ACBP KO (ACBP(GFAP) KO) and whole-body KO (ACBP KO) mice. Male and female ACBP(GFAP) KO and ACBP KO mice do not show significant changes in anxiety-like behaviour compared to control littermates during elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) tests. Surprisingly, ACBP(GFAP) KO and ACBP KO mice were unresponsive to the anxiolytic effect of a low dose of diazepam during EPM tests. In conclusion, our experiments using genetic ACBP loss-of-function models suggest that endozepines deficiency does not affect anxiety-like behaviour in mice and impairs the anxiolytic action of diazepam.",

Mechanistic evaluation of descriptors showed that models did not require comprehensive a priori information to predict Rs. Average predicted errors for the verification and blind test sets were 0.03 \u00b1 0.02 L d(-1) (RTD-model) and 0.03 \u00b1 0.03 L d(-1) (GSD-model) relative to experimentally determined Rs.

The aim of the study was to find out how the medical and nursing staff in a general hospital estimated the frequency of use for these drugs, and the risk-benefit ratio for elderly patients as well as the factors which positively influence the perceived use of these drugs. Methods | All members of the medical and nursing staff of a hospital received a questionnaire about their use of, and attitudes towards, benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. Absolute and relative frequencies were calculated to estimate the perceived frequency of use and the risk-benefit ratio. Multiple logistic regressions were used to analyze which factors are associated with a perceived high use of benzodiazepines or Z-drugs for insomnia. Results | More nurses than hospital doctors believed that they dispensed benzodiazepines often or always (57 % vs. 29 %) to patients with insomnia; this was also the case for Z-drugs (66 % vs. 29 %). Nearly half of the hospital doctors and 29 % of the nurses perceived more harms than benefits for benzodiazepines in the elderly. The following factors were associated with a high perceived usage of Z-drugs: working as a nurse (OR: 13,95; 95%-CI: 3,87-50,28), working in a non-surgical department (5,41; 2,00-14,61), having < 5 years of professional experience (4,90; 1,43-16,81) and feeling that the benefits of Z-drugs outweigh the risks for elderly patients (5,07; 1,48-17,35).

Upon arrival at the hospital he had cardiac arrest, was resuscitated, and moved to the catheterization laboratory with inferior, posterior, and lateral myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed an unusual thrombosis in multiple coronary branches. Toxicology report showed high levels of amphetamines and benzodiazepines in the patient's original blood sample. The patient was kept under ventilation for 18 days, with difficult recovery due to severe withdrawal manifestations, ventilation acquired pneumonia, and rhabdomyolysis inducing acute renal failure. The patient regained near normal left ventricular function after baseline severe regional and global dysfunction. We postulate a relationship between the use of amphetamines, potentiated by benzodiazepines, and occurrence of acute thrombosis of multiple major coronary arteries.", 
    "173": "Depressive delusion is the key symptom of psychotic depression also known as major depressive disorder with psychotic features (ICD-10: F 32.3). Delusional topics are limited to guilt, impoverishment and hypochondria. Kurt Schneider described these as being the three primordial fears of human beings. Psychotic depression is distinguished by the particular severity and frequency of the episodes of illness as well as by increased suicidal tendencies. Although one in five patients with a major depression experiences psychotic symptoms, this condition is all too easily overlooked and the appropriate therapy is not initiated. Here we use case histories to illustrate some of the obstacles to diagnosis arising from the difficulty of identifying delusions hidden in a person's experience of depression, life history and personality. A targeted active exploration of these difficulties is significant taking into account the observable symptoms and not only the subjectively experienced symptoms. A phenomenological approach is chosen to explore the matter of depressive delusion and to investigate the interaction of delusion and affect and the special importance of anxiety for the genesis of delusion. In accordance with the current treatment recommendations and against this background, it is proposed that the pharmacological strategy should be supplemented by the use of benzodiazepines more often than has it has been in the past.",

This article reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and tolerability profile of asenapine in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia. Clinical trials with asenapine have demonstrated efficacy in terms of both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, although findings have not always been consistent. Across three short-term (6-week) studies in acute schizophrenia (including one in Asian patients), asenapine was generally superior to placebo and had broadly similar efficacy to active controls in improving total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A meta-analysis of four short-term trials with asenapine (that also included a negative study and a failed trial) also showed significant benefit with asenapine over placebo. In longer-term trials and extensions (up to \u22483\u00a0years' duration), asenapine was effective relative to placebo in preventing relapse in schizophrenia, but was less effective than olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (according to intent-to-treat LOCF analysis). However, in two trials in patients with persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia, asenapine and olanzapine were similarly effective in reducing negative symptoms at week 26, with asenapine providing better results than olanzapine at week 52 in one of the extensions. The most frequently reported adverse events with asenapine are somnolence, akathisia and oral hypoesthesia. Although potentially associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms, asenapine appears to have less weight gain and metabolic effects than some other antipsychotic agents, such as olanzapine.", 
    "175": "A rare kind of antibody, known as anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibody, is found in some patients. The antibody works against the GAD enzyme, which is essential in the formation of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter found in the brain. Patients found with this antibody present with motor and cognitive problems due to low levels or lack of GABA, because in the absence or low levels of GABA patients exhibit motor and cognitive symptoms. The anti-GAD antibody is found in some neurological syndromes, including stiff-person syndrome, paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), limbic encephalopathy, cerebellar ataxia, eye movement disorders, and epilepsy. Previously, excluding MFS, these conditions were calledhyperexcitability disorders. However, collectively, these syndromes should be known as \"anti-GAD positive neurological syndromes.\" An important limitation of this study is that the literature is lacking on the subject, and why patients with the above mentioned neurological problems present with different symptoms has not been studied in detail. Therefore, it is recommended that more research is conducted on this subject to obtain a better and deeper understanding of these anti-GAD antibody induced neurological syndromes.",

Patients complain of unpleasant sensations in the legs, at or before bedtime, and feel an urge to move the legs, which improves with movement, such as walking. Symptoms start with the patient at rest (e.g. sitting or lying down), and follow a circadian pattern, increasing during the evening or at night. Many pharmacological intervention are available for RLS, including drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (L-Dopa and dopaminergic agonists), epilepsy (anticonvulsants), anxiety (benzodiazepines), and pain (opioids). Dopaminergic drugs are those most frequently used for treatment of RLS, but some patients do not respond effectively and require other medication. Opioids, a class of medications used to treat severe pain, seem to be effective in treating RLS symptoms, and are recommended for patients with severe symptoms, because RLS and pain appear to share the same mechanism in the central nervous system. All available drugs are associated to some degree with side effects, which can impede treatment. Opioids are associated with adverse events such as constipation, tolerance, and dependence.

Since Soviet period the most popular injective narcotics have been opioids: home-made opium, heroine, buprenorphine and home-made desomorphine (\"Krokodile\") replacing each other on the black market. Self-made desomorphine typically contains big amounts of different toxic substances and causes significant somatic disorders, especially skin, bone, blood infections, liver and kidney failure; is highly addictive, associates with frequent injections that enhance injecting-related harm, including the risk of HIV transmission, in comparison with typical opioids. The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of opioid substitution treatment (OST) on depression and anxiety in opioid dependent clients with history of different opioid substance use. 104 opioid drug users undergoing OST with intensive psychological counseling have been divided in 5 groups according to the principal opioid drug that was abused during past 6 months before starting treatment: heroine, desomorphine, illicit methadone injectors, illicit buprenorphine injectors, and multiple drug abusers consuming opioids as primary drugs. Level of depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (Spielberger Anxiety Inventory) as well as clinical symptoms, risky behavior, quality of life (WHO), and other data were measured before starting and after 3, 9, 15, 21 months of treatment. The illegal use of psychotropic-narcotics was checked through random urine-testing 1-2 times per patient per month. In all five groups remarkable decrease of depression and anxiety was observed in comparison with the starting data. Before inclusion desomorphine and poly-drug users had the highest scores of depression and anxiety while buprenorphine users manifested the lowest rate. Improvement of figures was observed in all groups in three month period that have been continuing during 21 month of treatment process. Study revealed normalization of scores forbothstatesin groups of heroine, desomorphine, methadone and buprenorphine users. The highest scores of depression and anxiety were observed in the group of poly-drug abusers andwhile depression rate hesitated in the range of clear \"no-depression\", anxiety index still remained close to the clinical important threshold after 21 month of treatment. Urine-testingon psychotropic-narcotic substances indicated remarkable decrease of illegal drug abuse in all studied groups in three month and although abuse of benzodiazepine drugs was highest in desomorphine and poly-drug abusers, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. Although some disparities have been observed in dynamics of subjects with different spectrum of initial opioid substance use, including homemade desomorphine, there is no significant difference between groups and OST effectively supports to improve depression and anxiety indices, and dramatically decreases use of illegal psychotropic-narcotic drugs during treatment. However poly-drug users seems to be the most resistant to achieve stabilization and require more treatment time and targeted interventions.", 
    "200": "CT Perfusion (CTP) derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) thresholds have been proposed as the optimal parameter for distinguishing the infarct core prior to reperfusion. Previous threshold-derivation studies have been limited by uncertainties introduced by infarct expansion between the acute phase of stroke and follow-up imaging, or DWI lesion reversibility. In this study a model is proposed for determining infarction CBF thresholds at 3hr ischemia time by comparing contemporaneously acquired CTP derived CBF maps to 18F-FFMZ-PET imaging, with the objective of deriving a CBF threshold for infarction after 3 hours of ischemia. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was injected into the brain of Duroc-Cross pigs (n = 11) through a burr hole in the skull. CTP images were acquired 10 and 30 minutes post ET-1 injection and then every 30 minutes for 150 minutes. 370 MBq of 18F-FFMZ was injected ~120 minutes post ET-1 injection and PET images were acquired for 25 minutes starting ~155-180 minutes post ET-1 injection. CBF maps from each CTP acquisition were co-registered and converted into a median CBF map. The median CBF map was co-registered to blood volume maps for vessel exclusion, an average CT image for grey/white matter segmentation, and 18F-FFMZ-PET images for infarct delineation. Logistic regression and ROC analysis were performed on infarcted and non-infarcted pixel CBF values for each animal that developed infarct. Six of the eleven animals developed infarction. The mean CBF value corresponding to the optimal operating point of the ROC curves for the 6 animals was 12.6 \u00b1 2.8 mL\u00b7min-1\u00b7100g-1 for infarction after 3 hours of ischemia. The porcine ET-1 model of cerebral ischemia is easier to implement then other large animal models of stroke, and performs similarly as long as CBF is monitored using CTP to prevent reperfusion.",

Other prescription drugs that are misused include the newer antipsychotics such as quetiapine and olanzapine, and stimulants such as dexamphetamine and methylphenidate. Health professionals should be aware of behaviours that may indicate drug seeking, but dependency on prescription drugs can occur at any age, within any cultural group and across any educational class. Patients with dependencies may not necessarily display obvious drug-seeking behaviours. All general practices should have a practice policy on prescribing drugs of dependence. GPs should register with the Prescription Shopping Information Service.

    "202": "Zolpidem is not a typical GABAA receptor hypnotic. Unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem modulates tonic GABA currents in the rat dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, exhibits residual effects in mice lacking the benzodiazepine binding site, and improves speech, cognitive and motor function in human patients with severe brain injury. The receptor by which zolpidem mediates these effects is not known. In this study we evaluated binary \u03b11\u03b23 GABAA receptors in either the 3\u03b11:2\u03b23 or 2\u03b11:3\u03b23 subunit stoichiometry, which differ by the existence of either an \u03b11-\u03b11 interface, or a \u03b23-\u03b23 interface, respectively. Both receptor stoichiometries are readily expressed in Xenopus oocytes, distinguished from each other by using GABA, zolpidem, diazepam and Zn(2+). At the 3\u03b11:2\u03b23 receptor, clinically relevant concentrations of zolpidem enhanced GABA in a flumazenil-sensitive manner. The efficacy of diazepam was significantly lower compared to zolpidem. No modulation by either zolpidem or diazepam was detected at the 2\u03b11:3\u03b23 receptor, indicating that the binding site for zolpidem is at the \u03b11-\u03b11 interface, a site mimicking the classical \u03b11-\u03b32 benzodiazepine site. Activating \u03b11\u03b23 (3\u03b11:2\u03b23) receptors may, in part, mediate the physiological effects of zolpidem observed under distinct physiological and clinical conditions, constituting a potentially attractive drug target.",

    "211": "The discovery of central sleep apnea (CSA) at high altitude is usually attributed to Angelo Mosso who published in 1898. It can occur in susceptible individuals at altitude above 2000 m, but at very high altitude, say above 5000 m, it will occur in most subjects. Severity is correlated with ventilatory responsiveness, particularly to hypoxia. Theoretically, it should spontaneously improve with time and acclimatization. Although the time course of resolution is not well described, it appears to persist for more than a month at 5000 m.It occurs due to the interaction of hypocapnia with stages 1 and 2 NREM sleep, in the presence of increased loop-gain. The hypocapnia is secondary to hypoxic ventilatory drive. With acclimatization, one might expect that the increase in PaO2 and cerebral blood flow (CBF) would mitigate the CSA. However, over time, both the hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses increase, causing an increase in loop gain which is a counteracting force.The severity of the CSA can be reduced by descent, supplemental oxygen therapy, oral or intravenous acetazolamide. Recent studies suggest that acute further increases in cerebral blood flow will substantially, but temporarily, reduce central sleep apnea, without altering acid based balance. Very recently, bi-level noninvasive ventilation has also been shown to help (mechanism unknown). Sleep quality can be improved independent of the presence of CSA by the use of benzodiazepine sedation.", 
    "212": "Water-soluble prodrugs can be rapidly converted by enzymes to hydrophobic drugs, whose aqueous thermodynamic solubilities are low, but are maintained in aqueous solution at supersaturated concentrations due to slow precipitation kinetics. Recently, we investigated avizafone (AVF) in combination with Aspergillus oryzae protease as a prodrug/enzyme system intended to produce supersaturated diazepam (DZP). Several fold enhancement of permeation of supersaturated DZP across Madin-Darby canine kidney II-wild type (MDCKII-wt) monolayers was observed, compared to saturated DZP solutions. However, prodrug conversion was incomplete, putatively due to partial racemization of AVF and stereoselectivity of A oryzae protease. Here we report synthesis of chirally pure AVF, and demonstrate complete conversion to supersaturated DZP followed by complete DZP permeation at enhanced rates across MDCKII-wt cell monolayers. We also synthesized, for the first time, a chirally pure prodrug of midazolam (MDZ-pro) and carried out the same sequence of studies. A oryzae protease was identified as a benign and efficient activating enzyme for MDZ-pro. The MDZ-pro/A oryzae protease system showed greater than 25-fold increase in absorption rate of MDZ across MDCKII-wt monolayers, compared to saturated MDZ.

It is an equal amount combination of tiletamine, a dissociative anaesthetic pharmacologically classified as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, and zolazepam, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. There are concerns regarding the safety profile of this drug combination due to incidents of human misuse/abuse. In this paper, we discuss the abuse liability of this drug combination based on currently available scientific evidence. We performed an in-depth search of medical and scientific literature and found seven reported cases of human abuse of the TZ combination, two of which resulted in fatal outcomes. In most of these cases, drug administration was intentional indicating that the TZ combination was abused by humans. This finding is bolstered by the results of preclinical studies showing that the TZ combination produces rewarding effects in rats, although manifested only in pretreated subjects. Further studies revealed that the addictive effects of the TZ combination are influenced by pre-exposure to other psychoactive drugs. Pre-exposure to ketamine, diazepam, propofol, or ethanol facilitated the expression of the rewarding effects of the TZ combination. These findings support the hypothesis that the TZ combination was and can be used as a substitute or replacement drug. Altogether, the compiled evidence indicates that the TZ combination can potentially be abused by humans. Thus, careful use, dispensation, and monitoring of the TZ combination and associated substances are strongly advocated. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

We posed the following question regarding continuous deep sedation: 'Was the patient continuously and deeply sedated or kept in a coma until death by the use of one or more drugs'.", 
    "216": "After the initial rise of continuous deep sedation to 14.5% in 2007 (95%CI 13.1%-15.9%), its use decreased to 12.0% in 2013 (95%CI 10.9%-13.2%). Compared with 2007, in 2013 opioids were less often used as sole drug and the decision to use continuous deep sedation was more often preceded by patient request. Compared to non-experts, palliative care experts more often used benzodiazepines and less often opioids, withheld artificial nutrition/hydration more often and performed sedation more often after a request from or with the consent of the patient or family.", 
    "217": "Worldwide, this study is the first to show a decrease in the prevalence of continuous deep sedation. Despite positive changes in performance and decision-making towards more compliance with due care requirements, there is still room for improvement in the use of recommended drugs and in the involvement of patients and relatives in the decision-making process.", 
    "218": "A 39-year-old homeless man was found confused and incoherent after ingesting an estimated total of 200 tablets of various medications. He presented to the emergency department with delirium, tachycardia, clonus and hyperthermia of 38.0\u00b0C. His condition worsened rapidly with his temperature rising to 39.9\u00b0C despite active cooling. The patient was subsequently sedated, intubated, paralysed and admitted to the intensive care unit, where he remained for 38\u2005days. His initial presentation of a large mixed drug overdose manifested as serotonin syndrome, which had a protracted course complicated by ethanol withdrawal. He eventually stabilised and was transferred to the general ward, and was subsequently discharged from hospital on day 47 with continuing psychiatric care. This case demonstrates the challenges and considerations in diagnosis and management of large mixed drug overdoses where multiple toxidromes overlap.", 
    "219": "We report a case of delirium with anticholinergic symptoms in a 19-year-old female patient with schizophrenia. On the day the symptoms emerged, the patient received olanzapine long-acting injection and a higher dose of paliperidone. We observed symptoms ranging from confusion to delirium as well as some anticholinergic symptoms. The delirium lasted 24\u2005hours and was managed by intravenous fluid substitution and oral benzodiazepines. Olanzapine pamoate, paliperidone and cannabis are central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and their combination can increase the risks of CNS depression. In this case report, we review the symptoms of delirium in a case of antipsychotic overdose and provide general guidelines for managing these symptoms. We also review possible complications in combined use of cannabis, olanzapine and paliperidone.", 
    "220": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening complication of serotonergic agents. Although mirtazapine is a relatively safe antidepressant and has a comparatively low incidence of side effects, it still could induce serotonin syndrome.", 
    "221": "We described a 34-year-old man with schizophrenic disorder who presented with acute consciousness disturbance, extremely high fever, rigidity, and spontaneous clonus in lower limbs. Two days before entry, oral mirtazapine was added to his regular medication of olanzapine. The serotonin-related symptoms resolved soon after withdrawal of mirtazapine and olanzapine combined with treatment with intravenous benzodiazepine and oral cyproheptadine. However, the clinical course was complicated by rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and acute pulmonary edema. After receiving mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and appropriate supportive treatment, his general condition recovered and he was discharged without any neurological sequelae.", 
    "222": "With the increasing use of serotonergic agents, awareness of serotonin syndrome is important. Early diagnosis and timely discontinuation of the offending agent(s) are imperative to prevent morbidity and mortality.", 
    "223": "We report a novel case of \"grand mal on awakening\" from sleep presenting with intractable insomnia associated with interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) during sleep.", 
    "224": "A 36-year-old woman with a seizure history of grand mal on awakening since age 13 years suffered from severe, persistent insomnia despite seizure control with daytime valproic acid therapy. Bedtime hypnotic therapy with zolpidem and clonazepam was ineffective. An overnight polysomnographic (PSG) study with expanded EEG seizure montage found IEA with microarousals or full arousals from sleep, with a mean rate of IEA events of 19.0 per hour. The sleep macrostructure (the cycling and distribution of sleep stages) was disturbed by the IEA events, and the sleep efficiency was 67.2%. Bedtime valproic acid therapy, 500 mg, was rapidly effective. A follow-up PSG study documented a reduced mean rate of IED events of 5.8 per hour, and an improved sleep efficiency of 87.7%.", 
    "225": "Severe persistent insomnia with sleep-related IEA can occur as a major comorbidity of grand mal on awakening despite full seizure control. Although standard hypnotic therapy (benzodiazepine receptor agonist; benzodiazepine) was ineffective, bedtime monotherapy with valproic acid was promptly effective, with objectively-documented improvement. Therefore, when remitted epilepsy patients complain of persistent insomnia, clinicians should consider sleep-related IEA activity, with sleep disruption and poor sleep efficiency, in the differential diagnosis. A diagnostic PSG study with expanded EEG seizure montage should be considered.", 
    "226": "Extracts of the pepper plant kava (Piper methysticum) are effective in alleviating anxiety in clinical trials. Despite the long-standing therapeutic interest in kava, the molecular target(s) of the pharmacologically active constituents, kavalactones have not been established. \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) are assumed to be the in vivo molecular target of kavalactones based on data from binding assays, but evidence in support of a direct interaction between kavalactones and GABAARs is scarce and equivocal. In this study, we characterised the functional properties of the major anxiolytic kavalactone, kavain at human recombinant \u03b11\u03b22, \u03b22\u03b32L, \u03b1x\u03b22\u03b32L (x = 1, 2, 3 and 5), \u03b11\u03b2x\u03b32L (x = 1, 2 and 3) and \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 GABAARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. We found that kavain positively modulated all receptors regardless of the subunit composition, but the degree of enhancement was greater at \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 than at \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32L GABAARs. The modulatory effect of kavain was unaffected by flumazenil, indicating that kavain did not enhance GABAARs via the classical benzodiazepine binding site. The \u03b23N265M point mutation which has been previously shown to profoundly decrease anaesthetic sensitivity, also diminished kavain-mediated potentiation. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of the functional characteristics of a single kavalactone at distinct GABAAR subtypes, and presents the first experimental evidence in support of a direct interaction between a kavalactone and GABAARs.", 
    "227": "The treatment of quetiapine and/or citalopram poisoning is mainly supportive and involves gastric lavage, activated charcoal, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Recently, however, there were reports of successful treatment with intravenous lipid emulsion. Here we report a case of a 19-year-old Caucasian girl who ingested approximately 6000 mg of quetiapine, 400 mg of citalopram, and 45 mg of bromazepam in a suicide attempt. The patient developed ventricular tachycardia and epileptic seizures 12 h after admission to the hospital. As the patient's condition deteriorated, we combined standard therapy (intubation, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors) with low-dose intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) (a total of 300 mL of 20 % lipid emulsion) and normalised her heart rhythm and stopped the seizures. She was discharged to the psychiatric ward after 48 h and home after a prolonged (2-month) psychiatric rehabilitation. Intravenous lipid emulsion turned out to be effective even in the lower dose range than previously reported for quetiapine poisoning in patients presenting with seizure and ventricular arrhythmia. To our knowledge, there are no case reports describing the use of ILE in treating citalopram poisoning.", 
    "228": "Muscle relaxants are commonly prescribed for low back pain (LBP); however, there is limited evidence of their clinical efficacy and tolerability. This review evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of muscle relaxants in people with LBP. We searched online databases including Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO (inception to end October 2015) and performed citation tracking for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of randomized controlled trials of muscle relaxants. Pain outcomes were converted to a common 0-100 scale. Data were pooled using a random effects model with strength of evidence assessed using GRADE. Fifteen trials (3362 participants) were evaluated in this review. A total of five trials (496 participants) provide high quality evidence that muscle relaxants provide clinically significant pain relief in the short term for acute LBP; MD -21.3, [-29.0, -13.5]. There was no information on long-term outcomes. The median adverse event rate in clinical trials for muscle relaxants was similar to placebo 14.1% IQR (7.0-28.7%) and 16.0% (4.1-31.2%); p\u00a0=\u00a00.5, respectively. There is no evidence for the efficacy of benzodiazepines in LBP. For people with acute LBP, muscle relaxants provide clinically significant short-term pain relief. For chronic LBP, the efficacy of muscle relaxants is largely unknown. There was no eligible RCT evidence to support the efficacy of benzodiazepines in LBP. Prolonged use of these medicines in LBP cannot be guided by trial evidence. WHAT DOES THIS REVIEW ADD?: Muscle relaxants provide clinically significant pain relief for acute low back pain. Caution must be taken with the interpretation of the findings as the evidence comes from specific muscle relaxant medicines."
