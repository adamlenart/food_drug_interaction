    "3": "Sleep disturbance was present in 69% of residents, insomnia (IN) in 42% and excessive daytime sleepiness (DS) in 34.6%. IN and DS scores were not significantly correlated(r = 0.10, p = 0.19). Use of hypnotics, sedating antidepressants, and depression were associated with insomnia. Depression and poor general medical health were associated with daytime sleepiness. On a cognitive task (Mini Mental State Examination) participants with insomnia only out-performed participants with no sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness; on a measure of physical function (PsychoGeriatric Dependency Rating Scale- physical domain), participants with insomnia fared better than those with daytime sleepiness only and those with both insomnia and daytime sleepiness. Participants with DS only performed worse on both measures compared to those with no sleep disturbance, those with insomnia only, and those with both insomnia and daytime sleepiness.",

    "5": "Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from thalamic ventrobasal (VB) and reticular (RTN) neurons in mouse brain slices. A bicuculline-sensitive tonic current was observed in VB, but not in RTN, neurons; this current was increased by the GABA(A) receptor agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisothiazolo-[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP; 0.1 microM) and decreased by Zn(2+) (50 microM) but was unaffected by zolpidem (0.3 microM) or midazolam (0.2 microM). The pharmacological profile of the tonic current is consistent with its generation by activation of GABA(A) receptors that do not contain the alpha(1) or gamma(2) subunits. GABA(A) receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells that contained alpha(4)beta(2)delta subunits showed higher sensitivity to THIP (gaboxadol) and GABA than did receptors made up from alpha(1)beta(2)delta, alpha(4)beta(2)gamma(2s,) or alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) subunits. Western blot analysis revealed that there is little, if any, alpha(3) or alpha(5) subunit protein in VB. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that antibodies to the delta subunit could precipitate alpha(4), but not alpha(1) subunit protein. Confocal microscopy of thalamic neurons grown in culture confirmed that alpha(4) and delta subunits are extensively co-localized with one another and are found predominantly, but not exclusively, at extrasynaptic sites. We conclude that thalamic VB neurons express extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors that are highly sensitive to GABA and THIP and that these receptors are most likely made up of alpha(4)beta(2)delta subunits. In view of the critical role of thalamic neurons in the generation of oscillatory activity associated with sleep, these receptors may represent a principal site of action for the novel hypnotic agent gaboxadol.",

    "17": "Glial cell activation occurs in response to brain injury and is present in a wide variety of inflammatory processes including dementia associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected glial cells release cytokines and chemokines that, along with viral neurotoxins, contribute to neuronal damage and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if glial cell activation in HIV-positive (HIV+) patients could be detected noninvasively, in vivo, using [11C]-R-PK11195 with positron emission tomography (PET). [11C]-R-PK11195 is a selective radioligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), and is known to reflect the extent of glial cell activation. A subaim was to determine if nondemented HIV+ patients could be distinguished from those with HIV-associated dementia (HAD) on the basis of [11C]-R-PK11195 binding. Five healthy volunteers and 10 HIV+ patients underwent PET with [11C]-R-PK11195. Time-radioactivity curves (TACs) were generated from dynamic PET images in nine regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The average radioactivity was calculated in each ROI and was normalized to the average radioactivity in white matter. Patients with HAD showed significantly higher [11C]-R-PK11195 binding than controls in five out of eight brain regions (P < .05, Mann-Whitney U test). Nondemented HIV+ patients did not show significantly increased binding compared to controls. HIV+ patients overall (demented and nondemented) showed significantly higher radioligand binding than controls in five brain regions (P < 0.05). Patients with HAD did not show significant differences in binding when compared to HIV+ nondemented patients. The findings of this pilot study support a role for glial cell activation in HAD, and that PET with [11C]-R-PK11195 can detect the concomitants of neuronal damage in individuals infected with HIV.", 
    "18": "The expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes (M(1)-M(5)) was studied in the rat efferent ductules and epididymis at the mRNA and protein levels. The relative abundance of each mAChR transcript subtype differed depending on the tissue and the epididymal region analyzed. The M(1) mAChR mRNA level was more abundant in the efferent ductules than in the caput and cauda of the epididymis. The M(2) mAChR mRNA level was similar between the efferent ductules and caput of the epididymis and higher in the cauda region. The M(3) mAChR mRNA level was low in the efferent ductules and caput of the epididymis, but high levels were detected in the cauda region. mRNAs for M(4) and M(5) mAChRs were not detected in these tissues. Our studies indicated a variable degree of immunostaining for each mAChR subtype in a cell-type and tissue-specific pattern. M(1) mAChR was detected over the efferent ductule epithelium. M(2) and M(3) mAChRs were observed in the apical region of the ciliated cells. Apical and narrow cells of the initial segment showed distinct staining by M(1) antibody, whereas a supranuclear reaction was noted in the principal cells of the caput of the epididymis. In addition, staining for M(1) and M(2) mAChRs was visible in the apical membrane of some epithelial cells of the cauda region. M(3) mAChR was detected in the peritubular smooth muscle of the efferent ductules and epididymis. Functional studies suggested the involvement of this subtype in epididymal tubule contraction. Thus, the cell-specific expression of the various mAChR subtypes in the efferent ductules and epididymis suggests that these receptors play a role in the modulation of luminal fluid composition and smooth muscle contraction.", 
    "19": "Concern has been recently raised for risperidone and olanzapine, possibly associated with cerebrovascular events in placebo-controlled trials conducted in elderly subjects with dementia. We investigated the relationship between exposure to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and occurrence of cerebrovascular accidents in the elderly. From the regional database of hospital admissions of Lombardy, Italy, we extracted all patients aged 65 or older with cerebrovascular-related outcomes for the year 2002. From the regional database of prescriptions reimbursed by the National Health Service, we extracted all patients aged 65 or older who received antipsychotic prescriptions during 2001. The 2 databases were linked anonymously using the individual patient code. The proportions of cerebrovascular accidents were 3.31% (95% confidence interval, 2.95-3.69) in elderly subjects exclusively exposed to SGAs and 2.37% (95% confidence interval, 2.19-2.57) in elderly subjects exclusively exposed to first-generation antipsychotics. After background group differences were controlled for, exposure to SGAs significantly increased the risk of accidents. The analysis of cerebrovascular events in elderly subjects exposed to each individual SGA, in comparison with exposure to haloperidol, showed a significantly increased risk for risperidone only (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.93). These data provide preliminary epidemiological evidence that exposure to SGAs, in comparison with exposure to first-generation antipsychotics, significantly increased the risk of cerebrovascular accidents in the elderly.", 
    "20": "To thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of atypical antipsychotic associated weight gain, a feeding laboratory paradigm was developed. This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial comparing the tolerability and effects of a two-week exposure to olanzapine, risperidone or placebo on weight, resting energy expenditure (REE), and eating behaviors in 48 healthy human subjects. Subjects were randomized to receive olanzapine, risperidone, or placebo and titrated over four days to 10 mg/d, or 4 mg/d, respectively. The mean dose at endpoint was 8.75 mg/day for the olanzapine group and 2.88 mg/d risperidone group. Weight changes were significantly different between groups at midpoint (F = 5.477, df = 2, 44, P = .0001). The olanzapine group demonstrated a significant increase in weight at midpoint (1.59 + 1.80 kg, P = .002) and endpoint (2.25 + 1.62 kg, P = .0001) compared to placebo and at endpoint compared to risperidone (1.05 + 1.15 kg, P = .015). Resting energy expenditures corrected for fat free mass did not reveal any differences between groups. Olanzapine subjects demonstrated significantly more dry mouth and sedation versus placebo while risperidone subjects experienced significantly more sedation, dry mouth, dizziness stuffy nose and restlessness than placebo and more dizziness and stuffy nose versus olanzapine subjects. Thus, a human feeding lab paradigm utilizing a brief exposure to atypical antipsychotics functions as a method to investigate pharmacologically induced weight gain.",

    "26": "A 24-year-old female with community-acquired pneumonia presented with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. To maintain adequate sedation and ventilation and reduce airway pressure, several relaxation strategies were used including high-dose intravenous lorazepam, fentanyl, and cisatracurium. After 18 days of high-dose continuous infusion of lorazepam (maximum dose 50 mg/h), the patient developed severe lactic acidosis secondary to propylene glycol toxicity, the main diluent of lorazepam. The acidosis temporarily resolved with bicarbonate administration and discontinuation of lorazepam. Her renal function remained stable for a time (serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, urine output 100-200 mL/h). However, after several more days, the patient's condition deteriorated, and she ultimately died.",

    "33": "The spontaneous development of self-injurious behavior (SIB) in singly housed monkeys poses a challenge for their management and well-being in captivity. Relatively little information is available on effective treatments for SIB. This study examined the effects of diazepam (Valium) on self-wounding and other abnormal behaviors in eight individually housed male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Each monkey's response to an anxiolytic dose of diazepam (1 mg/kg or greater orally) was compared with the animal's behavior during drug-free periods. When examined across all animals, treatment with diazepam did not significantly alter wounding frequency or rates of self-directed biting without wounding. However, closer examination of the data revealed that four of the animals showed significant decreases in self-biting and wounding frequency (positive responders, PR group), whereas the remaining monkeys showed a trend towards increased wounding frequency (negative responders, NR group). Subsequent examination of colony and veterinary records demonstrated that compared with NR monkeys, PR monkeys had spent significantly more years in individual cage housing and had experienced a greater number of minor veterinary procedures. PR animals also were significantly less likely to have a documented history of self-biting behavior. Our findings suggest that SIB is not a homogeneous disorder in rhesus monkeys; rather, distinct subtypes exist that require different treatment approaches.",

    "38": "The Apocynaceae plant family contains a great number of so called eburnamine-vincamine alkaloids. Quite a few of these alkaloids exert varied pharmacological activities on the cell multiplication, cardiovascular system, and brain functions. Many derivatives were also synthesized to find pharmacologically active compounds better characterized and safer to be administered than the natural plant alkaloids themselves. We concentrate on the eburnamine structures with cerebral activities in this review. Vincamine, vinburnine, vindeburnol, apovincaminate, and vinpocetine (cis-ethyl-apovincaminate) all share modulatory effects on brain circulation and neuronal homeostasis, bear antihypoxic and neuroprotective potencies to various degrees. The most eminent compound of this class of alkaloids is vinpocetine. Since its introduction to the market as a neuroprotective agent many non clinical and clinical studies proved vinpocetine's effects on calmodulin dependent phosphodiesterase E1, on sodium, calcium channels, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, and glutamate receptors as well as its clinical usefulness in the treatment of post-ischaemic stroke disease states and various disorders of cerebrovascular origin. Lately, positron emission tomography studies proved that vinpocetine has a rapid uptake in the primate and human brain with a heterogeneous distribution pattern (preference areas: thalamus, basal ganglia, and visual cortex) both after intravenous and oral administration. Vinpocetine exerts beneficial effects in cerebral glucose metabolism and regional cerebral blood flow in chronic post-stroke patients.", 
    "39": "The aim of this review is to establish the relationship between treatment with hypnotics and the risk of postural instability and as a consequence, falls and hip fractures, in the elderly. A review of the literature was performed through a search of the MEDLINE, Ingenta and PASCAL databases from 1975 to 2005. We considered as hypnotics only those drugs approved for treating insomnia, i.e. some benzodiazepines and the more recently launched 'Z'-compounds, i.e. zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon. Large-scale surveys consistently report increases in the frequency of falls and hip fractures when hypnotics are used in the elderly (2-fold risk). Benzodiazepines are the major class of hypnotics involved in this context; falls and fractures in patients taking Z-compounds are less frequently reported, and in this respect, zolpidem is considered as at risk in only one study. It is important to note, however, that drug adverse effect relationships are difficult to establish with this type of epidemiological data-mining. On the other hand, data obtained in laboratory settings, where confounding factors can be eliminated, prove that benzodiazepines are the most deleterious hypnotics at least in terms of their effects on body sway. Z-compounds are considered safer, probably because of their pharmacokinetic properties as well as their selective pharmacological activities at benzodiazepine-1 (BZ(1)) receptors. The effects of hypnotics on balance, gait and equilibrium are the consequence of differential negative impacts on vigilance and cognitive functions, and are highly dose- and time-dependent. Z-compounds have short half-lives and have less cognitive and residual effects than older medications. Some practical rules need to be followed when prescribing hypnotics in order to prevent falls and hip fractures as much as possible in elderly insomniacs, whether institutionalised or not. These are: (i) establish a clear diagnosis of the sleep disorder; (ii) take into account chronic conditions leading to balance and gait difficulties (motor and cognitive status); (iii) search for concomitant prescription of psychotropics and sedatives; (iv) use half the recommended adult dosage; and (v) declare any adverse effect to pharmacovigilance centres. Comparative pharmacovigilance studies focused on the impact of hypnotics on postural stability are very much needed.",

    "45": "The role of the 5-HT(2A) receptor in modulating amphetamine-induced inhibition of dopamine neuronal firing in A9 and A10 was investigated in rat midbrain slices. The antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and clozapine more potently reversed the amphetamine-induced inhibition in A10 neurons compared to A9 neurons. Risperidone (0.03 and 0.1 microM) reversed amphetamine-induced inhibition of firing activity similarly in A9 and A10. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (-)sulpiride (0.05 and 1 microM) reversed the amphetamine (10 microM)-induced inhibition of firing activity in A9 and A10 neurons. The selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist MDL 100907 (0.05 microM), strongly enhanced the reversal of amphetamine-induced inhibition by (-)sulpiride in A10, but its effectiveness was much smaller in A9 dopamine neurons. We conclude that 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism enhanced reversal of amphetamine-induced inhibition by dopamine D2 antagonism in A10, suggesting that dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism combined with 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism may play a role in antipsychotic drug atypicality.",

The method involves decontamination of hair with methylene chloride, hair cut into small pieces, incubation of 20 mg in phosphate buffer (pH 8.4) in the presence of 1 ng diazepam-d5 used as internal standard, liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether/methylene chloride (10/90) and separation using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification for all benzodiazepines and hypnotics range from 0.5 to 5 pg/mg using a 20-mg hair sample. Linearity is observed from the limit of quantification of each compound to 200 pg/mg (r2 > 0.99). Coefficients of variation measured on six points and at two concentrations (10 and 50 pg/mg) range from 5 to 20% for all drugs but one. Extraction recovery, measured at the two same concentrations range from 32 to 76%. These results were found suitable to screen for 16 benzodiazepines in hair and detect them at very low concentrations, making this method suitable to monitor single dose.",

Benzodiazepines were extracted from alkalinised spiked and clinical plasma and oral fluid samples using a single step, liquid-liquid extraction procedure with diethyl ether. The chromatographic separation was performed with a Xterra RP18, 5 microm (150 x 2.1 mm i.d.) reversed-phase column using deuterated analogues of the analytes as internal standard. The recovery ranged from 70.3 to 86.9% for plasma and 63.9 to 77.2% for oral fluid. The limits of detection ranged from 0.5 to 1 ng/ml in plasma and 0.1 to 0.2 ng/ml for oral fluid. The method was validated for all the compounds, including linearity and the main precision parameters. The procedure, showed to be sensitive and specific, was applied to real plasma and oral fluid samples.

Patients' urine tests were analyzed for methadone metabolite, opiates, benzodiazepine, cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines. Their urine results for drug abuse throughout the months prior to filling in the questionnaire and their maintenance methadone doses were recorded. Drug abuse was defined by at least one positive urine test. Methadone serum levels were available in 55 patients, assessed by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy. The patients' self-reported chronic pain questionnaires and their diagnosed psychiatric disorders were analyzed. Out of the 101 study patients, 78.2% were male, 52.5% had psychiatric disorders, 46.5% reported having chronic pain and 46.5% had positive urine for benzodiazepine. The mean daily methadone dose was 157+/-52.9 mg. The mean PSQI score was 9+/-4.8 (75.2% had scores >5 indicating \"poor sleepers\"). PSQI scores were higher in patients with positive urine for benzodiazepine, chronic pain and psychiatric disorders and they correlated with years of opiate abuse before admission to MMT, and with the methadone dose (r=0.48, p<0.0005). The latter two also correlated with each other. The PSQI was not correlated with duration in MMT, gender, age, abuse of opiates, cannabis or cocaine. We concluded that sleep disorders should be evaluated and treated among MMT patients, particularly in those with psychiatric disorders, benzodiazepine abuse, chronic pain and high methadone dose.",

In this work, we evaluated the levels of NBDZ in maternal/foetal serum during delivery after spontaneous labour (VD) or caesarean section (CS). For both the VD (n=11) and the CS (n=11) groups (VD+CS=22), three blood samples were collected at three different times: the first was collected three days before labour, the second immediately after delivery or at fetal abdominal extraction and the third one was obtained at second day post-partum. NBDZ were measured by radioreceptor binding assay after HPLC extraction and purification while cortisol was measured through radioimmunoassay. In the VD group, a significant increase of NBDZ levels occurred at labour in comparison with the levels found in pre- and post-partum periods. By the contrary, no differences in NBDZ levels were found in the CS group at the three different times. The levels of cortisol in the VD group were found to be higher at labour than that determined at pre- and post-partum. Again no significant changes were found in the CS group. These findings suggest for the first time that labour is associated with a marked increase of NBDZ which could be envisaged as a stress-related event.", 
    "50": "The four-plates test (FPT) is an animal model of anxiety which allows the detection of anxiolytic effect not only of benzodiazepines (BZDs) but also of other non-BZDs anxiolytic compounds such as antidepressants (ADs). Furthermore, DOI, a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, has been shown to exert an anxiolytic-like effect in this model. Retesting mice in animal models of anxiety (test-retest paradigm) induces an anxiogenic-like and a loss of anxiolytic-like effects in response to BZDs and ADs. On the contrary, DOI has been reported to oppose the fear potentiation induced by trial 1 in the FPT. Despite DOI is considered as one of the most selective 5-HT(2A) available, it acts as agonist at all three 5-HT(2) receptor subtypes (5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C)). The aim of this study was thus to investigate in the FPT test-retest paradigm, which 5-HT(2) receptor subtype(s) was involved in the DOI-induced effect in experienced mice. The effect of DOI (0.25-4 mg/kg) and the agonists, 5-HT(2B), BW 723C86 (1-16 mg/kg) and 5-HT(2C), RO 60-0175 (0.25-4 mg/kg) have also been studied. Then, antagonism studies were conducted combinating the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist SR 46349B, the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist SB 206553 or the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist RS 10-2221 (at the doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) with the DOI (1 mg/kg). Our study shows that the BW 723C86 had no effect on retesting mice, whereas it exerted an anxiolytic-like effect in naive mice. By contrast to DOI, the RO 60-0175 had no effect neither in naive nor experienced mice. Furthermore, only the SR 46349B antagonized the DOI-induced anti-punishment effect. Diazepam included as a positive control also increased in each case the number of punished passages in naive mice. Our findings altogether also suggest that DOI exerts its anxiolytic-like effect in the FPT test-retest paradigm through 5-HT(2A) receptors.",

    "54": "The dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei (VMHdm) has been related to the modulation of defensive behavior in mammals. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that administration into the VMHdm of midazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor full agonist, or AP7, a glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist, would produce anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) or the Vogel's punished licking tests. Male Wistar rats with unilateral cannulae aimed at the VMHdm received intra-cerebral injections of midazolam (15-60 nmol/0.25 microL), AP7 (0.2-2 nmol/0.3 microL) or saline and were submitted to the behavioral tests. Midazolam (30 nmol) increased the percentage of time spent in open arms of the EPM. AP7, on the other hand, decreased open and enclosed arm exploration. In the Vogel test, however, both midazolam (30-60 nmol) and AP7 increased the number of punished licks. Histological control experiments found no significant effects when the drugs were injected into the nearby lateral hypothalamic area. These results suggest that facilitation of gabaergic or antagonism of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the VMHdm can produce anxiolytic-like effects.",

Acetonitrile was selected as the solvent in which both compounds showed well-defined bands. Both analytes showed good stability in this solvent when solutions of the analytes were exposed to light and temperatures between 20 degrees and 80 degrees C. The simultaneous determination of both drugs was performed by the zero-crossing method at 226.0 and 257.0 nm for N-butylscopolamine and oxazepam, respectively. The linear range of determination was found to be 2.5 x 10(-7) to 8.0 x 10(-5) mol/L for N-butylscopolamine and 7.1 x 10(-8) to 8.0 x 10(-5) mol/L for oxazepam. A very good level of repeatability (relative standard deviation) of 0.2% was observed for N-butylscopolamine and oxazepam. The ingredients commonly found in pharmaceutical formulations do not interfere. The proposed method was applied to the determination of these drugs in pharmaceutical formulations (capsules).", 
    "56": "Sleep disorders have a high prevalence in patients with Parkinson's disease--some authors report it to be in the range of 60% - 98%. Together with the underlying motor symptoms, sleep disorders are the main causes of disability and have a substantial impact on the quality of life of these patients. Of particular interest are the behavior disorders of REM sleep (RBD) which are reported in many cases to precede the development of Parkinson's disease. In cases of diagnosing a REM sleep behavior disorder, it is absolutely necessary to exclude any underlying neurodegenerative process. Unlike the diagnosis of idiopathic RBD which can easily be made by conducting only a structured clinical interview, more than half of the RBD cases in patients with Parkinson's disease would be omitted using this technique. Patients with Parkinson's disease should be examined by polysomnography as the clinical interview's sensitivity alone can hardly reach 33%. This is so because there are mild forms of RBD in Parkinson's disease while the idiopathic forms always present with markedly severe clinical manifestations. Pathogenetically, Parkinson's disease share many similar features with RBD. Both conditions are characterized by a reduced striatal dopaminergic mediation. And yet there is no definitive answer to the question why RBD does not develop in all patients with Parkinson's disease. Clonazepam is highly effective in the treatment of RBD. Early diagnosis is thus critical for the prevention of injuries to the patient or to the patient's bed partner.", 
    "57": "Liver fibrosis and its end-stage disease cirrhosis are major world health problems arising from chronic injury of the liver by a variety of etiological factors including viruses, alcohol and drug abuse, the metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disease and hereditary disorders of metabolism. Fibrosis is a progressive pathological process in which wound-healing myofibroblasts of the liver respond to injury by promoting replacement of the normal hepatic tissue with a scar-like matrix composed of cross-linked collagen. Until recently it was believed that this process was irreversible. However emerging experimental and clinical evidence is starting to show that even cirrhosis is potentially reversible. Key to this is the discovery that reversion of fibrosis is accompanied by clearance of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) by apoptosis. Furthermore, proof-of-concept studies in rodents have demonstrated that experimental augmentation of HSC apoptosis will promote the resolution of fibrosis. Consequently there is now considerable interest in determining the molecular events that regulate HSC apoptosis and the discovery of drugs that will stimulate HSC apoptosis in a selective manner. This review will consider the regulatory role played by growth factors (e.g. NGF, IGF-1, TGFbeta), death receptor ligands (TRAIL, FAS), components and regulators of extracellular matrix (integrins, collagen, matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors) and signal transduction proteins and transcription factors (Rho/Rho kinase, Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), IkappaKinase (IKK), NF-kappa B). The potential for known pharmacological agents such as gliotoxin, sulfasalazine, benzodiazepine ligands, curcumin and tanshinone I to induce HSC apoptosis and therefore to be used therapeutically will be explored.", 
    "58": "Some data suggest that cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor agonists stimulate the growth of colon cancer. Melatonin, an endogenous indoleamine with strong antioxidant properties, displays antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties both in vivo or in vitro in several types of tumors. We used HT-29 human colon cancer cells, expressing CCK receptors, to test the antiproliferative effects of several antagonists of CCK-A and/or CCK-B and their possible synergism with melatonin. HT-29 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum at 37 degrees C. Cell proliferation was assessed by the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA. Annexin V-FITC plus propidium iodine were used for flow cytometry apoptosis/necrosis evaluation. The following drugs were tested: gastrin (CCK-B agonist); CCK-8s (CCK-A agonist); proglumide (CCK-A plus CCK-B antagonist); lorglumide (CCK-A antagonist); PD 135,158 (CCK-B antagonist and weak CCK-A agonist); devazepide or L 364,718 (CCK-A antagonist); L 365,260 (CCK-B antagonist), and melatonin. The results shown a lack of effects of gastrin on HT-29 cell proliferation, whereas CCK-8s induced proliferation at high doses. The order of the antiproliferative effect of the other drugs was devazepide > lorglumide > proglumide. These drugs produce cell death mainly inducing apoptosis. Melatonin showed strong antiproliferative effect at millimolar concentrations, and it induced apoptotic cell death. Melatonin generally enhanced the antiproliferative effects of devazepide, lorglumide and proglumide and increased the proglumide-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that melatonin and CCK-A antagonists are useful for controlling human colon cancer cell growth in culture and in combined therapy significantly increases their efficiency.", 
    "59": "Various clinical situations may arise in the PICU that necessitate the use of sedation, analgesia, or both. Although there is a large clinical experience with midazolam in the PICU population and it remains the most commonly used benzodiazepine in this setting, lorazepam may provide an effective alternative, with a longer half-life and more predictable pharmacokinetics without the concern of active metabolites. However, there are limited reports regarding its use in the PICU population, and concerns exist regarding the potential for toxicity related to its diluent, propylene glycol. Although the synthetic opioid fentanyl frequently is chosen for use in the PICU setting because of its hemodynamic stability, preliminary data suggest morphine may have a slower development of tolerance and may cause fewer withdrawal symptoms than fentanyl. Morphine's safety profile includes long-term follow-up studies that have demonstrated no adverse central nervous system developmental effects from its use in neonates and infants. In the critically ill infant at risk following surgery for congenital heart disease, clinical experience supports the use of the synthetic opioids, given their ability to modulate PVR and prevent pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Alternatives to the benzodiazepines and opioids include ketamine, pentobarbital, or dexmedetomidine. Ketamine may be useful for patients with hemodynamic instability or airway reactivity. There are limited reports regarding the use of pentobarbital in the PICU, with one study raising concerns of a high incidence of adverse effects associated with its use. Propofol has gained great favor in the adult population as a means of providing deep sedation while allowing for rapid awakening; however, its routine use is not recommended because of its potential association with \"propofol infusion syndrome.\" As the pediatric experience increases, it appears that there will be a role for newer agents such as dexmedetomidine.",

Patients received risperidone long-acting injectable, 25 mg, by intramuscular injection every 2 weeks; the dose could be increased to 37.5 or 50 mg if necessary. Patients were transferred directly from their previous medication to risperidone long-acting injectable without a run-in period of oral risperidone treatment. Of 192 patients recruited, 134 patients (70%) completed the study. The principal reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (8%), adverse events (6%), insufficient response (5%) and non-compliance (4%). Risperidone long-acting injectable produced a significant improvement (p = 0.0001) in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores, from 74.2+/-21.3 at baseline to 65.8+/-21.4 at endpoint. There were also significant reductions in PANSS subscales (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psycho-pharmacology) and Marder factor scores. The Clinical Global Impression increased significantly from baseline to endpoint (p = 0.0001), as reflected by the increase in the proportion of patients rated as 'not ill' or 'borderline ill' from 10% at baseline to 21% at endpoint. Risperidone long-acting injectable was also associated with significant improvements in Global Assessment of Function, patient satisfaction with treatment, and quality of life, measured on the SF-36 scale. Movement disorders, measured on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, were significantly reduced following the change to risperidone long-acting injectable. Treatment with risperidone long-acting injectable was well tolerated, and no significant weight gain occurred during the study. This open study suggests that risperidone long-acting injectable produces symptomatic improvement in schizophrenia patients previously considered symptomatically stable with olanzapine, along with improvement in movement disorders.

A semi-structured interview was conducted with all participants and the information gained was analysed using the Consensual Qualitative Research Approach, which allowed comparisons to be made between the views of the two groups of interviewees. There was commonality between GPs and BUs on reasons for commencing benzodiazepines, the role of dependence in continued use, and the importance of lifestyle change in its cessation. However, several differences emerged regarding commencement of use and processes of cessation. In particular, users felt there was greater need for GPs to routinely advise patients about non-pharmacological management of their problems and potential adverse consequences of long-term use before commencing benzodiazepines. Cessation could be discussed with all patients who use benzodiazepines for longer than 3 months, strategies offered to assist in management of withdrawal and anxiety, and referral to other health service providers for additional support. Lifestyle change could receive greater focus at all stages of treatment.", 
    "99": "The patient with status epilepticus has continuous or rapidly repeating seizures. Generalised convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common form of the disorder and is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical management. Status epilepticus that does not respond to first-line benzodiazepines (lorazepam or diazepam) or to second-line antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin/fosphenytoin, phenobarbital or valproate) is usually considered refractory and requires more aggressive treatment. The optimal treatment of refractory GCSE has not been defined, but patients should be treated in an intensive care unit, as artificial ventilation and haemodynamic support are required. Invasive haemodynamic monitoring is often necessary and EEG monitoring is essential. The drug treatment of refractory GCSE involves general anaesthesia with continuous intravenous anaesthetics given in doses that abolish all clinical and electrographic epileptic activity, often requiring sedation to the point of burst suppression on the EEG. Barbiturate anaesthetics, pentobarbital in the US and thiopental sodium in Europe and Australia, are the most frequently used agents and are highly effective for refractory GCSE both in children and adults. Indeed, they remain the only way to stop seizure activity with certainty in severely refractory cases. Other options are midazolam for adults and children and propofol for adults only.Regardless of the drug selected, intravenous fluids and vasopressors are usually required to treat hypotension. Once seizures have been controlled for 12-24 hours, continuous intravenous therapy should be gradually tapered off if the drug being administered is midazolam or propofol. Gradual tapering is probably not necessary with pentobarbital or thiopental sodium. Continuous EEG monitoring is required during high-dose treatment and while therapy is gradually withdrawn. During withdrawal of anaesthetic therapy, intravenous phenytoin/fosphenytoin or valproate should be continued (these agents having been administered during earlier phases of GCSE) to ensure an adequate baseline of antiepileptic medication so as to prevent the recurrence of status epilepticus. If additional medication is needed, the most appropriate antiepileptic drugs are gabapentin for focal seizures and levetiracetam and topiramate for all seizure types, as these drugs can be started at high doses with a low risk of idiosyncratic reactions. Even with current best practice, mortality in patients who experience refractory GCSE is about 50% and only the minority return to their premorbid functional baseline. Therefore, new treatment options are urgently needed.

All patients were given injection diclofenac sodium (75 mg) promethazine hydrochloride (12.5 mg) deep intramuscular 30 minutes the before procedure. Injection midazolam 0.03 mg/kg body weight slowly given intravenously immediately before the procedure for achieving sedation. Injection fentanyl 50 mcg intravenously given slowly just before introducing the ureteroscope into ureter for achieving intravenous analgesia. Patients were observed for few hours after completion of procedure and oral questions were asked as per proforma, which included tolerance, intensity of pain and percentage of pain experienced by the patients. Patients were discharged thereafter.",

This experiment was performed to investigate the anxiolytic-like effects of ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rg3-R, and Rg3-S, and the Rg5 and Rk mixture isolated from the ginseng saponin fraction in the elevated plus-maze. Furthermore, the anxiolytic-effects of Rb1, Rg1, Rg3-R, Rg3-S, and the Rg5 and Rk mixture were compared with those of a well-known active anxiolytic drug (diazepam). The oral administration of ginsenoside Rb1 significantly increased the number of open arm entries and the time spent on the open arm compared with those in the vehicle-treated group. Ginsenoside Rg1 and the Rg5 and Rk mixture also significantly increased the number of open arm entries and the time spent on the open arm. However, ginsenosides Rg3-R and Rg3-S did not increase the number of open arm entries or the time spent on the open arm. On the other hand, ginsenoside Rb1 and the Rg5 and Rk mixture decreased locomotor activity in a manner similar to diazepam. These data indicate that ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, and the Rg5 and Rk mixture have anxiolytic-like effects, but ginsenosides Rg3-R and Rg3-S do not in this model. We provide evidence that some ginsenosides may be useful for the treatment of anxiety.",

Oral administration of FMPD increased rat nucleus accumbens 3,4-dihyroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations (ED200 = 6 mg/kg), blocked 5-HT2A agonist-induced increases in rat serum corticosterone levels (ED50= 1.8 mg/kg), and inhibited the ex vivo binding of [125I]SB-258585 [4-iodo-N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide] to striatal 5-HT6 receptors (ED50= 10 mg/kg) but failed to inhibit ex vivo binding of [3H]pyrilamine to hypothalamic histamine H1 receptors at doses of up to 30 mg/kg. In electrophysiology studies, acute administration of FMPD selectively elevated the number of spontaneously active A10 (versus A9) dopamine neurons and chronic administration selectively decreased the number of spontaneously active A10 (versus A9) dopamine neurons. FMPD did not produce catalepsy at doses lower than 25 mg/kg p.o. In Fos-induction studies, FMPD had an atypical antipsychotic profile in the striatum and nucleus accumbens and increased Fos expression in orexin-containing neurons of the hypothalamus. FMPD produced only a transient elevation of prolactin levels. These data indicate that FMPD is an orally available potent antagonist of dopamine D2, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT6 receptors and a weak antagonist of H1 and 5-HT2C receptors. FMPD has the potential to have efficacy in treating schizophrenia and bipolar mania with a low risk of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin elevation, and weight gain. Clinical trials are needed to test these hypotheses.", 
    "106": "Peripheral nerve inputs have an inhibitory effect on motor cortex excitability at short intervals (short-latency afferent inhibition, SAI). This can be tested by coupling electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. SAI is reduced by the anticholinergic drug scopolamine, and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is possible that SAI is a marker of central cholinergic activity important for memory function. The benzodiazepine lorazepam also reduces SAI. Since benzodiazepines impair memory formation, but do not do so uniformly, with a maximum amnesic effect after lorazepam but less or no effect after diazepam, we were interested in testing in this non-behavioural study to what extent the effects of lorazepam and diazepam on circuits involved in SAI could be dissociated. In addition, and for control, we tested the effects of lorazepam and diazepam on short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), a motor cortical inhibition mediated through the GABA(A) receptor. Lorazepam markedly reduced SAI, whereas diazepam slightly increased it. In contrast, both benzodiazepines uniformly increased SICI. Our findings demonstrate opposite effects of lorazepam and diazepam on SAI, an inhibition modulated by central cholinergic activity, but the same effects on SICI, a marker of neurotransmission through the GABA(A) receptor. This dissociation suggests, for the first time, that TMS measures of cortical inhibition provide the opportunity to segregate differences of benzodiazepine action in human central nervous system circuits.", 
    "107": "Isobolographic analysis was used to characterize the interactions between loreclezole (LCZ) and clonazepam (CZP), ethosuximide (ETS), phenobarbital (PB), and valproate (VPA) in suppressing pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and in producing acute neurotoxic adverse effects in the chimney test in mice so as to identify optimum combinations. Moreover, protective indices (PIs) and benefit indices (BIs) were calculated so that a ranking in relation to advantageous combination could be established. Any pharmacokinetic contribution was ascertained by measurement of brain antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations. All AED combinations comprising LCZ and CZP, ETS, PB, and VPA (at the fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1) were additive in their seizure suppression. However, these interactions were complicated by changes in brain AED concentrations consequent to pharmacokinetic interactions. Thus, LCZ significantly increased total brain ETS concentrations (VPA, CZP, and PB concentrations were unaffected), and ETS decreased, and VPA increased, total brain LCZ concentrations. Only combinations of LCZ with CZP and PB were completely free of any pharmacokinetic interaction. Furthermore, in the chimney test, isobolographic analysis showed that the combination of LCZ and CZP, at the fixed ratio of 1:1, was supra-additive (synergistic, P<0.05), whereas LCZ and ETS at fixed ratios of 1:3 and 1:1 were subadditive (antagonistic, P<0.05). The remaining combinations of LCZ with CZP (1:3 and 3:1), ETS (3:1), PB (all fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1), and VPA (at the fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1) barely displayed additivity. In conclusion, BI, which is a measure of the margin of safety and tolerability of drugs in combination and comprises anticonvulsant and neurotoxic measures, was favorable for only one combination (LCZ and ETS at a fixed ratio of 1:3) with a value of 1.39. In contrast, LCZ and CZP constitute an unfavorable combination (BI=0.61-1.01). The combinations of LCZ with PB or VPA do not offer any advantage as assessed by the parameters (BI range: 0.75-0.91) used in this study. However, these conclusions are confounded by the fact that LCZ is associated with significant pharmacokinetic interactions.", 
    "108": "The present study was conducted to examine the effects of tramadol, an atypical opioid on convulsive behaviour in maximal electroshock (MES) seizure test on mice. Moreover, an attempt was also made to investigate the role of possible receptor mechanisms involved. MES seizures were induced via transauricular electrodes (60 mA, 0.2 sec). Seizure severity was determined by (1) the duration of tonic hindlimb extensor (THE) phase and by (2) mortality due to electroconvulsions. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of tramadol dose-dependently (10-50 mg/kg) decreased the duration of THE phase of MES. The anticonvulsant effect of tramadol was antagonized by the opioid antagonists, naloxone in high dose, and MR2266, a selective kappa antagonist but not by naltrindole, a delta opioid antagonist. Coadministration of either gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic drugs (diazepam, GABA, muscimol and baclofen) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK801 with tramadol augmented the anticonvulsant effect of the latter drug. By contrast, flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist, counteracted the diazepam-induced facilitation of anti-MES effect of tramadol. Similarly, delta-aminovaleric acid (DAVA), a GABAB receptor antagonist, abolished the facilitatory effect of baclofen, a GABAB agonist on anti-MES action of tramadol. These BZD-GABAergic antagonists, flumazenil or DAVA, on their own also antagonized the anti-MES effect of tramadol administered alone. No significant effect on mortality was observed in any of the studied groups. Taken together, the current results have demonstrated a possible role for multitude of important neurotransmitter systems, i.e., opioid (kappa), GABAA-BZD receptors system, GABAB receptors and NMDA channel involvement in the antielectroshock effect of tramadol in mice.",

In this study the anticonvulsant actions of norfluoxetine and fluoxetine were studied and compared to those of phenytoin and clonazepam in pentylenetetrazol-induced mouse epilepsy models. Pretreatment with fluoxetine or norfluoxetine (20mg/kg s.c.), as well as phenytoin (30 mg/kg s.c.) and clonazepam (0.1mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased both the rate and duration of survival, demonstrating a significant protective effect against pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy. These effects of norfluoxetine were similar to those of fluoxetine. According to the calculated combined protection scores, both norfluoxetine and fluoxetine were effective from the concentration of 10mg/kg, while the highest protective action was observed with clonazepam. Effects of norfluoxetine and fluoxetine on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were evaluated by measuring peak Ba2+ current flowing through the Ca2+ channels upon depolarization using whole cell voltage clamp in enzymatically isolated rat cochlear neurons. The current was reduced equally in a concentration-dependent manner by norfluoxetine (EC50=20.4+/-2.7 microM, Hill coefficient=0.86+/-0.1) and fluoxetine (EC50=22.3+/-3.6 microM, Hill coefficient=0.87+/-0.1).

Thirty-eight children being prescribed rectal diazepam gel by their clinician were prospectively recruited. Seizures, rectal diazepam use, emergency department visits, and quality of life data before and after study entry were recorded. The 38 children included 14 (37%) with complex febrile seizures, and 24 with epilepsy (n = 22) or a single seizure (n = 2). There were 23 (61%) children with prolonged seizures and 15 (39%) with repetitive seizures. During the 6-month follow-up period, 12 children experienced 26 seizures which met the criteria for rectal diazepam administration. Rectal diazepam gel was administered to 8 children on 19 occasions. In 16 (84%) of these episodes, seizures stopped and no emergency department visit was required. Parental stress was decreased between baseline and 6 months in both the overall group and in all the subgroups. Home use of rectal diazepam gel is effective in aborting seizure activity, often avoiding an emergency department visit. Its use reduces morbidity and costs associated with hospital visits and provides parents a treatment option for home management of prolonged or repetitive seizures.", 
    "127": "High performance liquid chromatography combined with either single quad or triple quad mass spectral detectors (LC/MS) was used to measure the brain distribution of receptor occupancy tracers targeting dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A and neurokinin NK-1 receptors using the ligands raclopride, MDL-100907 and GR205171, respectively. All three non-radiolabeled tracer molecules were easily detectable in discrete rat brain areas after intravenous doses of 3, 3 and 30 microg/kg, respectively. These levels showed a differential brain distribution caused by differences in receptor density, as demonstrated by the observation that pretreatment with compounds that occupy these receptors reduced this differential distribution in a dose-dependent manner. Intravenous, subcutaneous and oral dose-occupancy curves were generated for haloperidol at the dopamine D2 receptor as were oral curves for the antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and clozapine. In vivo dose-occupancy curves were also generated for orally administered clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol at the cortical 5-HT2A binding site. In vivo occupancy at the striatal neurokinin NK-1 binding site by various doses of orally administered MK-869 was also measured.

To document two cases involving this drug, we have developed an approach based on hair testing by LC-MS/MS. After pH 8.4 buffer incubation and extraction with methylene chloride/diethyl ether (80/20, v/v), hair extracts were separated on a XTerra MS C18 column using a gradient of acetonitrile and formate buffer. Alprazolam and diazepam-d5, used as internal standard, were detected by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. In the first criminal case, alprazolam tested positive in two consecutive 2 cm hair segments at 4.9 and 2.4 pg/mg, from a 12-year-old girl, assaulted by her father who had sedated her three or four times.

Between 1996 and 2000 in Hong Kong, a total of 197 FVC cases of deceased drivers were investigated. The blood and/or urine samples of the victims were examined for the presence of alcohol and drugs. The 197 cases were then classified into two groups: single-vehicle crashes (SVC) and multiple-vehicle crashes (MVC). Out of the 106 cases for the latter group, alcohol and/or drugs were detected in 22 cases (21%) while the remaining 84 cases (79%) were regarded as no significant finding. As for the 91 cases in SVC group, 51 cases (56%) were positive for alcohol and/or drugs. The findings indicate that a driver consuming alcohol and/or drugs has a higher risk of being involved in a FVC. The most frequently detected drugs for SVC group (11 cases) were: 46% central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (including designer drugs like MDMA); 36% cannabis; 18% benzodiazepines and 9% ketamine. The detected drug for the only case in the MVC group was a CNS stimulant.

However, about 10% of these patients develop a state characterised by confusion, restlesness, repetitive movements, lack of response to commands and amnesia regarding the period. This state, called emergence delirium, usually has a short duration but may persist for hours. In the present case a 50-year-old woman had 18 ECT treatments for severe depression. She experienced excellent effects as regards the depressive symptoms, but postictally she developed all the above-mentioned symptoms of delirium, which lasted for several hours.

Especially when found in concentrations generally regarded as toxic but not lethal, the question arises whether the combination of sublethal amounts was the likely cause of death. In this study, we examined poisoning deaths involving amitriptyline, propoxyphene and promazine, which are, after benzodiazepines, the most frequently occurring drugs in Finnish alcohol-related poisonings. From the forensic toxicology database, covering the years 1995-2002, we extracted 332 fatal poisonings, calculated median blood alcohol and drug concentrations, constructed concentration-concentration and concentration-response curves and evaluated the significance of the presence of therapeutic amounts of benzodiazepines. Median amitriptyline and propoxyphene concentrations were lower in alcohol-related cases than in clean drug poisonings. Correspondingly, the median blood alcohol concentrations in all drug-related poisonings were 1.5-2.2 mg/g lower than that found in clean alcohol poisonings. Alcohol concentration proved to be a more sensitive indicator of alcohol-drug interaction than drug concentration. This result suggests that when alcohol is present, relatively small overdoses of the studied drugs may result in fatal poisoning. In this context, fatal drug and alcohol concentrations and the issue of determining the most important agent in fatal drug-alcohol intoxications are discussed.",

While drug treatment of agitation is often essential, non-pharmacological interventions, both environmental and behavioral, also play important roles in the complex management of agitated patients. The most extensively used psychotropic drugs are parenteral formulas of conventional antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Recently, injection forms of two second generation antipsychotics, olanzapine and ziprasidone, have become available. Both drugs have shown adequate efficacy and tolerability in several double-blind trials of intramuscular administration in acutely agitated psychotic patients. Compared to conventional medication, injection forms of the new antipsychotics may have a faster onset of action and more favorable profile of adverse events. Alternative approaches to injection administration include liquid drug formula, orally disintegrating tablets and wafers, treatment initiation with high doses, or rapid dose escalation. Evidence suggests that second-generation antipsychotics should be among the first-line choices in the treatment of agitation in acute psychosis.", 
    "142": "Benzodiazepine enhancement of GABA(A) receptor current requires a gamma subunit, and replacement of the gamma subunit by the delta subunit abolishes benzodiazepine enhancement. Although it has been demonstrated that benzodiazepines bind to GABA(A) receptors at the junction between alpha and gamma subunits, the structural basis for the coupling of benzodiazepine binding to allosteric enhancement of the GABA(A) receptor current is unclear. To determine the structural basis for this coupling, the present study used a chimera strategy, using gamma2L-delta GABA(A) receptor subunit chimeras coexpressed with alpha1 and beta3 subunits in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Different domains of the gamma2L subunit were replaced by delta subunit sequence, and diazepam sensitivity was determined. Chimeric subunits revealed two areas of interest: domain 1 in transmembrane domain 1 (M1) and domain 2 in the C-terminal portion of transmembrane domain 2 (M2) and the M2-M3 extracellular loop. In those domains, site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the following two groups of residues were involved in benzodiazepine transduction of current enhancement: residues Y235, F236, T237 in M1; and S280, T281, I282 in M2 as well as the entire M2-M3 loop. These results suggest that a pocket of residues may transduce benzodiazepine binding to increased gating. Benzodiazepine transduction involves a group of residues that connects the N terminus and M1, and another group of residues that may facilitate an interaction between the N terminus and the M2 and M2-M3 loop domains.",

The length of time taking olanzapine ranged from 1 to 44 months. Body mass index, psychiatric status, and fasting blood levels were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.", 
    "145": "Significantly fewer subjects taking amantadine gained weight, with a mean change in body mass index of -0.07 kg/m2 for the amantadine group and 1.24 kg/m2 for the placebo group. This effect remained significant when the authors controlled for baseline body mass index and length of olanzapine treatment. No changes in fasting glucose, insulin, leptin, prolactin, and lipid levels were seen. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores remained stable.",

    "147": "DZ, a benzodiazepine known to affect centrosome separation at prophase, leads to a higher degree of mitotic arrest in HeLa cells than in primary human fibroblasts. In fact, differently from fibroblasts, which undergo a transient block in prophase-to-prometaphase transition, a high proportion of tumor cells attempt to escape from the DZ-imposed mitotic block, fail to undergo complete mitosis and die by mitotic failure. DZ-treated samples showed certain biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis, such as induction of the proapototic Bax protein, mitochondrial alterations assessed by JC-1 staining and TEM analysis, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. However, in DZ-treated cells, we observed a very low or absent caspase activation as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments with antibodies directed to activated caspases and by staining with the pancaspase inhibitor FITC-VAD-FMK. Experiments on mitochondrial depolymerization and apoptosis induction carried out in the presence of specific inhibitors of caspase-2 and caspase-3/7 indicated a caspase-independent apoptotic process induced by DZ. Accordingly, TEM analysis of treated cells revealed ultrastructural features resembling those reported for caspase-independent apoptosis. In conclusion, we hypothesize that HeLa cells override the prophase block imposed by DZ, producing a high rate of aberrant pro-metaphases, which, in turn, activates caspase-independent, apoptosis-like mitotic catastrophe.",

Conditioned models of anxiety were not assessed and are rarely encountered in phenotyping of genetically modified animals. The novel benzodiazepine site ligand L838,417 is a partial agonist at GABAA receptors containing an alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 subunit and an antagonist at alpha1 receptors, giving an anxiolytic profile devoid of sedation.

    "153": "The aims of this study were to (1) describe behavioral and corticosterone elevations that occur in aggressive mice conditioned to respond for the opportunity to fight another mouse, (2) determine if corticosterone elevations are necessary for operant responding and escalated aggression, and (3) determine if corticosterone elevations alter the aggression-heightening effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor positive modulators.", 
    "154": "Aggressive male CFW mice were conditioned to respond under the control of a fixed-interval 10-min (FI10) schedule that reinforced their operant behavior by the presentation of an intruder mouse into their home cage. After the FI10, aggressive behavior was ca. 75% higher than the species-typical levels of fighting and plasma corticosterone was more than twice as high after briefly fighting and/or responding on the FI10 schedule. Inhibition of corticosterone synthesis by metyrapone (30-100 mg/kg) reduced both conditioned responding as well as the aggressive behavior after the FI. Although the benzodiazepine midazolam (0.3-3 mg/kg) heightened species-typical aggressive behavior, it did not increase the high level of aggression engendered by the FI schedule. However, midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) and the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (17 mg/kg) both heightened aggression when given after corticosterone synthesis inhibition by metyrapone (56 mg/kg).",

Corticosterone elevations also appear to inhibit the aggression heightening effect of GABA(A) receptor positive modulators.", 
    "156": "Although the only widely accepted role for benzodiazepines in alcohol dependence is the treatment of withdrawal syndromes, they are frequently prescribed outside of this clinical setting. There is little empirical evidence to guide the rational use of benzodiazepines in the common clinical situation where anxiety disorders are comorbid with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Since January 1989, the Harvard Anxiety Research Program has naturalistically monitored the prospective clinical course of people with anxiety disorders, some of whom had a history of AUD. Earlier research showed that the use of benzodiazepines was not significantly associated with the presence or absence of a history of an AUD over the first year of follow-up. This report extends that investigation.", 
    "157": "Using standard parametric analytic methods, patterns of benzodiazepine use (routinely prescribed medication and as-needed [PRN] use) among participants receiving benzodiazepine treatment was prospectively examined over the course of 12 years. Differences in benzodiazepine usage patterns were examined in each year of follow-up between participants who did (n=120) and did not (n=425) have a new episode of AUD. Using proportional hazards regression analysis, benzodiazepine usage levels were examined as predictors of recovery and recurrence of AUD. Additionally, random-effects regression analyses were used to examine the patterns of benzodiazepine use before and after the onset of a prospectively observed episode of AUD.", 
    "158": "Benzodiazepine usage levels remained stable for the full sample over the course of the 12 years. Benzodiazepine use did not distinguish participants who had a new AUD from those who did not. Over the 12 years of follow-up, participants who had an AUD used more PRN medication in years five to eight. This difference reached statistical significance but was not clinically significant. Benzodiazepine usage levels did not predict recovery or recurrence in AUD subjects. Neither the total dose nor the PRN usage of benzodiazepines was significantly associated with the onset of AUD, but when combined into a measure of any benzodiazepine use, a relationship between increased use and the onset of AUD emerged.", 
    "159": "For participants in the Harvard Anxiety Research Program with comorbid alcohol dependence and anxiety disorders, there was little association between the use of benzodiazepines and the occurrence of a new AUD. Neither was there a temporal relationship between the use of benzodiazepines and the onset of a new AUD. Whether or not this finding extends to a broader patient population or a group of people who present to addictions treatment awaits further investigation.", 
    "160": "Previous research has implicated the alpha5-containing GABAA receptors of the hippocampus in the reinforcing properties of alcohol. In the present study, a selective GABAA alpha5 benzodiazepine inverse agonist (e.g., RY 023) was used in a series of in vivo and in vitro studies to determine the significance of the alpha5-receptor in the neurobehavioral actions of alcohol.", 
    "161": "In experiment one, systemic injections of RY 023 (1 to 10 mg/kg IP) dose-dependently reduced ethanol-maintained responding by 52% to 86% of controls, whereas bilateral hippocampal infusions (0.3 to 20 microg) reduced responding by 66% to 84% of controls. Saccharin responding was reduced only with the highest intraperitoneal (e.g., 10 mg) and microinjected (e.g., 20 microg) doses. In experiment two, RY 023 (3.0 to 15 mg/kg IP) reversed the motor-impairing effects of a moderate dose of alcohol (0.75 g/kg) on an oscillating bar task in the absence of intrinsic effects. In the open field, RY 023 (3.0 to 7.5 mg/kg) produced intrinsic effects alone but attenuated the suppression of the 1.25 g/kg ethanol dose. Because the diazepam-insensitive receptors (e.g., alpha4 and alpha6) have been suggested to play a role in alcohol motor impairing and sedative actions, experiment three compared the efficacy of RY 023 with Ro 15-4513 and two prototypical benzodiazepine antagonists (e.g., flumazenil and ZK 93426) across the alpha4beta3gamma2-, alpha5beta3gamma2-, and alpha6beta3gamma2-receptor subtypes in Xenopus oocytes.", 
    "162": "RY 023 produced classic inverse agonism at all receptor subtypes, whereas Ro15-4513 and the two antagonists displayed a neutral or agonistic profile at the diazepam-insensitive receptors.", 
    "163": "Overall, the results extend our previous findings by demonstrating that an alpha5-subtype ligand is capable of attenuating not only the rewarding action of alcohol but also its motor impairing and sedative effects. We propose that these actions are mediated in part by the alpha5-receptors of the hippocampus. The hippocampal alpha5-receptors could represent novel targets in understanding the neuromechanisms regulating the neurobehavioral actions of alcohol in humans.",

Patients who already had an intravenous access present were treated intravenous diazepam. Patients without an i.v. access at the time of convulsions were randomised into 2 groups and treated with either intramuscular midazolam or intravenous diazepam for control of seizures. Time interval from administration of drug to cessation of seizures was compared. Effectiveness of i.m. midazolam in various age groups, types of convulsions and etiology of convulsions was analyzed. Side effects of both drugs were evaluated.", 
    "166": "The mean interval to cessation of convulsions with i.m. midazolam was 97.22 seconds whereas in diazepam group without prior i.v. access it was 250.35 seconds and in diazepam group with prior i.v. access it was 119.4 seconds. i.m. midazolam acted faster in all age groups and in patients with febrile convulsions, which was statistically significant. i.m. midazolam was equally effective in various types of convulsions be it GTC or focal convulsions. 7 patients (10.8%) had thrombophlebitis associated with i.v. diazepam administration whereas none of the patients in the midazolam group had any side effects, which was statistically significant.", 
    "167": "i.m. midazolam is an effective agent for controlling acute convulsions in children especially in children with febrile convulsions.

    "172": "The results of the 5 available double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (and 1 open-label, 6-month extension) showed that eszopiclone was safe and effective in the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia in adult and geriatric patients. Tolerance with long-term exposure (6 mo) and rebound insomnia were not observed. The results of the 6-month, open-label extension trial demonstrated that improvements in sleep parameters were sustained. Future studies comparing eszopiclone with other non benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon) are needed with cost data to clearly define the role of eszopiclone in the pharmacotherapy of chronic insomnia.", 
    "173": "Second-generation antipsychotic agents (SGAs) are increasingly replacing first-generation antipsychotic agents due to their superior activity against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, decreased extrapyramidal symptoms and better tolerability. However, some SGAs are associated with adverse metabolic effects as significant weight gain, lipid disorders and diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of SGA-induced disturbances of glucose homeostasis is unclear. In vivo studies suggest a direct influence of SGAs on peripheral insulin resistance. To this end, we analyzed whether olanzapine might alter glycogen synthesis and the insulin-signaling cascade in L6 myotubes. Glycogen content was diminished in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Within the insulin-signaling cascade IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced several fold by insulin and was diminished by preincubation with olanzapine. IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was stimulated by insulin three-fold in L6 myotubes. Olanzapine inhibited insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in a dose-dependent manner. Protein mass of AKT, GSK-3 and GS was unaltered, whereas phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3 was diminished, and pGS was increased. Finally, we compared olanzapine with amisulpride, an SGA clinically not associated with the induction of diabetes mellitus. Glycogen content was diminished in olanzapine-preincubated L6 cells, whereas this effect was not observed under the amisulpride conditions. We conclude that olanzapine impairs glycogen synthesis via inhibition of the classical insulin-signaling cascade and that this inhibitory effect may lead to the induction of insulin resistance in olanzapine-treated patients.", 
    "174": "Impaired transmission of acetylcholine-mediated signaling by postsynaptic muscarinic M1 receptors has been postulated to underlie the limited efficacy of cholinergic replacement therapies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a clear relationship between the functionality of M1 receptors and dementia severity has not been demonstrated. The present study aims to measure M1 coupling to its nucleotide binding (G-) protein in the AD neocortex, and to correlate neurochemical findings with clinical features. A cohort of dementia patients was longitudinally assessed for cognitive decline, with postmortem neuropathological confirmation of AD diagnosis. Measures of M1 receptor density, M1/G-protein coupling and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities were performed in the frontal and temporal cortex of 24 AD patients as well as in 12 age-matched controls. We found that M1 receptor densities were unchanged in AD, which contrasted with significantly reduced M1 coupling to G-proteins in severely demented AD patients. Loss of M1/G-protein coupling in the frontal cortex, but not the temporal cortex, also correlated with the rate of cognitive decline. Additionally, correlations between M1/G-protein coupling and ChAT activities were demonstrated in both regions. These results suggest that defective coupling of neocortical M1 receptors to G-proteins is a neurochemical substrate of cognitive decline in AD. Based on its associations with ChAT deficits and dementia severity, we propose that M1/G-protein uncoupling may have a significant role in the disease mechanism of AD and thus may be considered to be a potential therapeutic target.", 
    "175": "Behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist bretazenil were compared with those of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil under conditions in which three baboons received continuous intragastric (i.g.) infusion of vehicle and then continuous i.g. infusion of triazolam (1.0 mg/kg/day). In each condition, acute doses of flumazenil (0.01-3.2 mg/kg) and bretazenil (0.01-10.0 mg/kg) were administered every 2 weeks (beginning after 30 days of treatment in the triazolam-dependent condition). Food pellets were available during daily 20-h sessions. Following test injections, 60-min behavioral observations were conducted followed by a fine motor assessment. During chronic vehicle administration, neither drug produced changes in observed behaviors. Bretazenil increased pellets earned and time to complete the fine-motor task (10.0 mg/kg dose). During chronic triazolam dosing, both bretazenil and flumazenil precipitated benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, characterized by vomiting, tremors/jerks, and a decrease in pellets earned. Thus, bretazenil can function as an antagonist under conditions of benzodiazepine physical dependence.", 
    "176": "We investigated the recognition properties of different GABA(A) receptor subtypes and mutant receptors for the biflavonoid amentoflavone, a constituent of St. John's Wort. Radioligand binding studies showed that amentoflavone recognition paralleled that of the classical benzodiazepine diazepam in that it had little or no affinity for alpha4- or alpha6-containing receptors. Lysine and alanine substitutions at position 101 of the rat alpha1 subunit resulted in a complete loss of competitive amentoflavone binding, but functional analysis of the alanine mutant expressed with beta2 and gamma2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes revealed no significant difference in the negative modulation of GABA-induced currents brought about by amentoflavone. Furthermore, elimination of the gamma subunit had no effect on the negative modulation of these currents. This negative modulation was also observed at alpha1beta1gamma2 GABA(A) receptors and is therefore not likely mediated by the loreclezole site. These results suggest a complex mechanism of amentoflavone interaction at GABA(A) receptors.",

Hypotension was documented in two patients in the propofol group and one patient receiving midazolam/meperidine. Propofol provided a significantly better patient cooperation than midazolam/meperidine (p < 0.01), but the procedure tolerability was rated nearly the same by both groups. Mean recovery time was significantly shorter in the propofol group (22 +/- 7 min vs 31 +/- 8 min for midazolam/meperidine (p < 0.01)) while the recovery score was significantly higher under propofol (8.3 +/- 1.2 vs 6.1 +/- 1.1(p < 0.01)).

We acquired positron emission tomography (PET) scans using the D2 ligand [11C]raclopride within the first 15 days of treatment to determine the percentage of D2 receptors occupied by the medication. According to response, dosage was then adjusted to a maximum dosage of 20 mg daily of either drug. PET scans were repeated after 10 to 12 weeks of treatment.",

When patients were rescanned following dosage adjustment, mean D2 receptor occupancies were greater than 70% in both groups.

In Germany, forensic pathologists are increasingly confronted by situations that necessitate an expert opinion on whether prevention of decubitus ulcers has been neglected in cases of suspected malpractice. This investigation was carried out in an attempt to identify risk factors for decubitus ulcers. We performed a postmortem case-control study in elderly persons who developed high-grade decubitus ulcers from 6 months to 14 days before death. Deceased with decubitus ulcers graded 3 or higher and controls at comparable risk were examined before cremation. After written informed consent had been obtained from the nearest living relatives, all available nursing and medical records of the deceased were thoroughly evaluated. Decubitus ulcer cases and controls were matched according to age, gender, immobility, and cachexia. One-hundred cases of decubitus ulcers with 71 grade 3 decubitus ulcers and 29 grade 4 decubitus ulcers were compared with 100 controls with 27 decubitus ulcers graded 2 or lower and the maximal risk as assessed by the Norton scale. The mean age was 86 years, 80% were females, 86% were bedridden, and cachexia was found in 66%. The individuals with decubitus ulcers were more often severely disabled, had more immobility of joints, and were more often under treatment with antidepressive and/or sedative drugs (e.g., opioid analgesies, neurolepties, benzodiazepines). Patients' impaired ability or unwillingness to comply or cooperate with preventive and therapeutic measures was more often recorded in cases of decubitus than in the control group. There was no evidence that supplementary nutrition or use of preventive pressure relief and protective devices differed between the decubitus cases and the controls.",

The following publications were excluded: review articles, case reports, panic attacks in disorders other than panic disorder, and studies on changes that occurred in-between panic attacks. The results showed that real-life panic attacks as well as those induced by selective panicogenic agents such as lactate and carbon dioxide do not activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Agonists of the colecystokinin receptor B, such as the colecystokinin-4 peptide and pentagastrin, increase stress hormones regardless of the occurrence of a panic attack and thus, seem to activate the HPA axis directly. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil does not increase stress hormones, but this agent does not reliably induce panic attacks. Pharmacological agents that increased anxiety in both normal subjects and panic patients raised stress hormone levels; among them are the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, the serotonergic agents 1-(m-chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP) and fenfluramine, as well as the psychostimulant agent caffeine.

The findings indicate that 144 (6.2%) participants had an insomnia disorder according to DSM-IV criteria, 17% displayed at least one symptom of insomnia, and more that half of the subjects were benzodiazepine users. According to multivariate analysis, psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio=1.51) and disruptive behaviors (adjusted odds ratio=2.10) were the only factors associated with an insomnia disorder among this population. In conclusion, insomnia is a fairly important problem, as a symptom or a syndrome, among elderly people and deserves attention from caregivers. Alternative interventions to benzodiazepine drugs, which are suited to long-term care residents while tailored to these specific care settings, should be developed.",

The effects of the St. John's wort extract (100 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 10 days) on metabolic activity of CYP450 were assessed in the system of isolated perfused rat liver. The substrates used in this study were tolbutamide (CYP2C6), dextromethorphan (CYP2D2) and midazolam (CYP3A2). Validated HPLC method was used to quantify all compounds of interest. St. John's wort administration affected CYP activity, causing a significant decline in AUC of dextromethorphan [F(4,31)=1511, p<0.001; PLSD, p<0.001] and AUC of midazolam [F(3,25)=221, p<0.001; PLSD, p=0.035] and a significant increase in AUC of tolbutamide [F(3,26)=200, p<0.001; PLSD, p<0.001]. St. John's wort administration resulted in a significant induction of CYP2D2 and CYP3A2, and in a significant inhibition of CYP2C6 metabolic activities.", 
    "201": "Previous studies have demonstrated that classical benzodiazepines decrease hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical cortex (HPA) axis activity. Paradoxically, high doses of benzodiazepines also stimulate basal circulating corticosterone levels in some conditions. Because benzodiazepine agonists display little selectivity to any of the alpha subtypes of the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor to which they bind, we propose that the unequivocal results are due to an alpha subtype-dependent modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical cortex axis output. To test this, basal hormonal output and induction of Fos in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus were measured after administration of various benzodiazepine ligands in mice. Zolpidem, a selective alpha1 subtype agonist, produced a very strong increase in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone whereas the inverse agonist FG7142 induced a small rise in plasma corticosterone. More surprisingly, the non-selective full agonists diazepam and zopiclone induced a lower increase in circulating corticosterone than after zolpidem. In contrast, the alpha(2,3,5)-selective benzodiazepine agonist and alpha1 antagonist L-838,417 had no effect on corticosterone levels. Strong induction of Fos in the paraventricular nucleus was found in response to zolpidem, diazepam, and zopiclone, but not after L-838,417. Finally, pre-administration of L-838,417 prior to zolpidem strongly inhibited the effect of zolpidem on corticosterone. Likewise, the non-selective agonists diazepam and zopiclone at a dose that alone had no effect on corticosterone also inhibited the effect of zolpidem. Taken together, these results suggest that benzodiazepine ligands modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical cortex axis through partly opposite mechanisms; and that the net effect is dependent on the composition of the GABA(A) receptor subunits to which they bind."
