Transport of glycine, GA-BA, noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin in the presence of the liquid membranes generated by the benzodiazepines in association with lecithin and cholesterol has been studied. The data indicate that modification in permeabilities in the presence of the liquid membranes is likely to make a significant contribution to several biological actions of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "1": "A homologous series of esters of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid was prepared by a new synthetic procedure. The first members of the series are convulsant or pro-convulsant agents while those with acyl residues longer than C4 show anticonvulsant activity. The affinity of the members of the series for the benzodiazepine receptor from rat brain decreases with the increasing chain length of the esters. The pentyl ester was studied in particular for its anti-convulsant effect on rats and mice treated with cardiazol. The compound also acts as a membrane stabilizer by inhibiting red cell hypotonic hemolysis and rat brain Na/K ATPase; its LD50 value is 12.5 mg/Kg and of particular interest is its lack of inhibitory effect on memory retention in mice at doses at which diazepam has inhibitory effects.", 
    "2": "The isometric method of assessment of the contractility of uterine strips in vitro makes it possible to follow up systematically the response of smooth uterine musculature to oxytocin and to test the effect of selected preparations on this process. In the submitted work the author investigated the effect of methyloxytocin, magnesium sulphate, seduxene, phenergan, plegomazine and DH-ergotoxin on the uterine contractions of strips of rat and human uteri ted. Based on the results of model experiments in vitro, the author discusses the effect of the mentioned substances on the spasmogenic activity of oxytocin.", 
    "3": "The protective effect of two benzodiazepine compounds, diazepam and clonazepam was tested against isoniazid (INH)- induced convulsions in rats pretreated with the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) transaminase inhibitor viz., aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), and the result was compared with that produced by the two drugs independently. Rats treated 6 h and not 30 min previously with AOAA showed a dose-dependent inhibition of INH-induced convulsions. In these animals both diazepam and clonazepam showed a greater protective effect than that produced by them alone. It is suggested from these findings that, even if their anticonvulsant mechanisms are distinct, with or without the involvement of GABA, AOAA and the benzodiazepine compounds seem to act synergistically against INH-induced convulsions.", 
    "4": "The effects of midazolam (3 nM) perfusion on the membrane and synaptic properties of dentate gyrus granule neurons were examined in hippocampal slices obtained from young adult (4-6 months) and old (24-26 months) Fischer 344 rats. In young neurons, midazolam perfusion resulted in a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential with no apparent change in the input resistance. Midazolam perfusion also produced a significant increase in the amplitude of the post-spike train afterhyperpolarization (AHP). In neurons obtained from old animals, midazolam perfusion also produced a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential but did not significantly change the AHP. These effects may result from altered calcium homeostasis in neurons of the aged brain, and suggest that at least some of the direct actions of benzodiazepines on mammalian central neurons are altered during aging.", 
    "5": "A method for the simultaneous determination of benzodiazepines in binary mixtures is proposed, based on the acid hydrolysis of benzodiazepines to benzophenones and the spectrophotometric determination of the latter in the presence of Nemol K 1030, a non-ionic surfactant condensate of ethylene oxide with nonylphenol. The experimental conditions for the hydrolysis of several benzodiazepines in sealed Pyrex tubes were determined. The addition of Nemol K 1030 to acidic solutions of benzophenones modified the positions of the absorption bands and made possible the simultaneous analysis of binary mixtures of benzodiazepines.", 
    "6": "The over-all dissociation constants, in anhydrous acetic acid, of a series of benzodiazepines have been determined. A method is described for evaluating the formation constants of the perchlorate salts. From these values simple potentiometric and visual titration methods for the assay of benzodiazepines in acetic acid are described.", 
    "7": "The effect of an antacid containing aluminium-hydroxide, magnesium-hydroxide and calcium carbonate (Trigastril) on the bioavailability of orally administered pirenzepine (Gastricur) was evaluated in 10 subjects in a double-blind single dose cross-over study. Pirenzepine was assayed in plasma by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method. A 2-compartment model was taken as a basis for the calculation of the plasma concentration curves and the pharmacokinetic parameters. The oral bioavailability of a 50 mg pirenzepine tablet concomitantly administered with 10 ml of the antacid gel preparation was slightly but not significantly greater than that of pirenzepine in the presence of a placebo gel. This was reflected by a mean increase of 18-28% in area under the curve (AUC 0-32, AUC 0-infinity, resp.) and of 26% in Cmax-values. There was no significant difference in the biological half-life of pirenzepine between the two treatments (10.1-9.4 h).", 
    "8": "The ability of electrically-induced convulsions to alleviate at least some symptoms of mental illness was first reported in the literature 50 years ago; however, the cerebral mechanisms responsible for such therapeutic effects have thus far escaped elucidation. It is thus interesting to note that those seeking explanations for the therapeutic effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have focused their attention on the convulsion produced by ECT, as opposed to the coma. The present hypothesis emphasizes the coma following the convulsion as a potential explanation of the effectiveness of ECT and other convulsive therapies. It is postulated that the primary effect of the convulsion is to cause the release of adenosine (ARN) from neuronal tissue and that the subsequent depressant effect of ARN on neuronal activity results in the clinical effect observed. Thus hypothesis suggests that chemically-induced coma, particularly coma induced by benzodiazepines, may offer a safe, effective and more acceptable alternative to ECT.",

    "10": "During a two year period prospective continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of 275 infants identified seizure activity in 55 cases, 31 of whom were treated with anticonvulsant drugs on clinical grounds. EEG and clinical response was complete in only two and equivocal in another six. Clinical response with persistent EEG seizures occurred in 13 and neither clinical nor EEG response in 10. There was no significant improvement in the generally poor neurological outcome compared with that in 24 infants whose seizures were not treated because of limited or absent clinical manifestations. Background EEG abnormality (as an index of associated cerebral dysfunction) was a guide to potential lack of response to anticonvulsant drugs; it was also predictive of subsequent clinical outcome irrespective of treatment. This study shows that commonly used anticonvulsant drugs (phenobarbitone, paraldehyde, phenytoin, and diazepam) have little effect on seizure control or neurological outcome in neonatal seizures associated with haemorrhagic, hypoxic, or ischaemic cerebral lesions. In view of the variable clinical appearance of EEG seizure activity, continuous EEG monitoring should be an essential feature of further study of neonatal anticonvulsant treatment.", 
    "11": "Thirty families were taught to administer rectal liquid diazepam to their children to stop a seizure at home. Twelve children had previous prolonged afebrile seizures, and 18 had either prolonged or repeated febrile seizures. During follow-up, 17 of the 30 families administered the rectal diazepam an average of three times per child with no complications. Fifteen of 17 families reported prompt cessation of the seizure, while in two the rectal diazepam was unsuccessful and hospital treatment was needed. We conclude that rectal diazepam is a useful adjunctive home treatment for children at risk for prolonged seizures. Hospitalization is decreased and parental confidence increased. Without our knowledge, twelve families taught others how to give the rectal diazepam, a practice that might be hazardous and should be anticipated.", 
    "12": "In previous research, two groups of rats exposed to a fixed time (FT) 1-min schedule of food-pellet delivery exhibited equal schedule-induced polydipsia for water vehicle and a 0.05 mg/ml solution of midazolam, respectively. Exposure to FT schedule values greater than 1 min (3 and 5 min) resulted in greater milliliter per pellet intakes of midazolam than of water, perhaps reflecting the reinforcing efficacy of the drug. To determine if drugs with unequivocal reinforcing efficacy display similar elevations at the larger FT values, solutions of cocaine and ethanol, but also of the equivocally reinforcing agents chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam, as well as water, were offered to groups of rats at concentrations isoacceptable under FT 1-min schedule-induction conditions. Under the FT 1-min schedule, separate groups of rats drank equal and excessive amounts of water, cocaine (0.15 mg/ml), ethanol (2.5% v/v), chlordiazepoxide (0.25 mg/ml) and flurazepam (0.175 mg/ml). Differential group milliliter per pellet intakes occurred under larger FT values: ethanol, cocaine and midazolam yielded greater values than water, chlordiazepoxide or flurazepam. Schedule-induced drug intake perhaps offers a method for evaluating the oral abuse potential of a drug under conditions which generate a variety of behavioral excesses and may potentiate intrinsic reinforcing efficacy.", 
    "13": "[3H]Telenzepine has been shown to bind with high affinity (3 x 10(9) M-1) to a subpopulation of muscarinic binding sites in rat cerebral cortex, which have a high affinity for pirenzepine. The binding kinetics were very slow at 30 degrees. Only 50% of the [3H] telenzepine was found to be capable of binding to the receptors with high affinity. This suggested the presence of optical isomers of telenzepine. These were partially resolved on the picomole scale by using cortical muscarinic receptors to selectively bind the active isomer. It was then possible to measure the temperature and time dependence of the racemization of the inactive to the active enantiomer. The energy barrier for the inversion was 35 kcal/mol, and racemization was very slow even at 90 degrees. The affinity and selectivity of the unlabeled enantiomers for the different muscarinic receptor subtypes present on membranes from rat cerebral cortex, heart, and lacrimal gland was measured. The selectivity of active (+)-isomer was considerably greater than that of the (-)-isomer. As a consequence, the stereoselectivity of the enantiomers varied from 500 (M1 receptors in cerebral cortex) to 75 (cardiac receptors).", 
    "14": "Eleven healthy volunteers received a single intravenous dose of diazepam (0.15 mg/kg), midazolam (0.1 mg/kg), and placebo by 1-minute infusion in a double-blind, three-way crossover study. Plasma concentrations were measured during 24 hours after dosage, and the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum was simultaneously computed by fast-Fourier transform to determine the percentage of total EEG amplitude occurring in the 13 to 30 Hz range. Both diazepam and midazolam had large volumes of distribution (1.2 and 2.3 L/kg, respectively), but diazepam's half-life was considerably longer (33 versus 2.8 hours) and its metabolic clearance lower (0.5 versus 11.0 ml/min kg) than those of midazolam. EEG changes were maximal at the end of the diazepam infusion and 5 to 10 minutes after midazolam infusion. Percent 13 to 30 Hz activity remained significantly above baseline until 5 hours for diazepam but only until 2 hours for midazolam. For both drugs, EEG effects were indistinguishable from baseline by 6 to 8 hours, suggesting that distribution contributes importantly to terminating pharmacodynamic action. The relationship of EEG change to plasma drug concentration indicated an apparent EC50 value of 269 ng/ml for diazepam as opposed to 35 ng/ml for midazolam. However, Emax values were similar for both drugs (+19.4% and +21.3%, respectively).", 
    "15": "Fifty-one out-patients presenting with generalised anxiety disorder were included in a double-blind trial, and treated with either buspirone (a new non-benzodiazepine antianxiety drug) or diazepam over 6 or 12 weeks, after which they were abruptly withdrawn and continued on placebo to 14 weeks. Ratings of anxiety and other symptoms were administered fortnightly and additional withdrawal symptoms noted. Forty patients completed the study; 8 of the 11 drop-outs were taking buspirone. Both drugs reduced anxiety, diazepam more rapidly, but with greater withdrawal symptoms, particularly after 6 weeks. Regular treatment with diazepam for 6 weeks leads to a significant risk of pharmacological dependence that is not present with buspirone.", 
    "16": "Masticatory spasm is a rare clinical feature and mostly associated with disorders of general movement. Usually it occurs bilaterally. Unilateral masticatory spasm is mostly associated with facial hemiatrophy. So, unilateral masticatory spasm without facial hemiatrophy is extremely rare. As far as we have investigated, only one case has been reported in the literature. We will report one more case herein, with some discussion on its pathogenesis. Case report A 44-year-old man presented with a 8 month history of slowly progressive recurrent spasm of the left masseter muscle. The spasm was exaggerated by tension and lasted for up to 10 seconds. Several drugs could not reduce the frequency of spasm, but only clonazepam could decrease it slightly. On admission, the spasm lasted usually for 1 or 2 seconds. Except for masticatory spasm, neurological examination comprising trigeminal nerve function, was normal and facial atrophy was not observed. On the contrary, hypertrophy of the left masseter muscle was noted. Needle electromyography (EMG) study revealed synchronized spasm discharges of the ipsilateral masseter, lateral and medial pterygoid muscles. All of other investigations, including CSF analysis, electroencephalography, somatosensory evoked potential, visual evoked potential, CT scan and vertebral angiography, showed normal findings. After all, we could not find any apparent organic lesions which cause masticatory spasm, so surgical treatments were not carried out. He was discharged and now, continues to take clonazepam daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The technique of in vitro fertilization (IVF) was simplified by the development of ultrasound-supported transvaginal follicular centesis. This makes it possible to dispense with general anesthesia. As an alternative, an intravenous analgosedation with midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2 micrograms/kg) is presented. Besides a good analgesic and anxiolytic action, an incipient respiratory depression was observed, so that insufflation of oxygen-enriched air is to be recommended. The operation is felt to be comfortable by almost all patients. A high degree of anterograde amnesia is attained. Meticulous intraoperative and postoperative anesthesiological monitoring is a prerequisite for application of this procedure.", 
    "18": "A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted in 314 duodenal ulcer patients to compare the efficacy and safety of the antimuscarinics telenzepine and pirenzepine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer. Patients received telenzepine 3 mg (156) once-daily at bedtime or 50 mg pirenzepine (158) two times daily for 2 weeks. If ulcerous lesions persisted treatment was extended to 4 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by relief of ulcer pain and endoscopic findings of ulcer healing. Safety was determined on the basis of side effects and results of laboratory tests. The 2- and 4-week healing rates achieved with telenzepine were 21.1 and 67.3%, respectively, and with pirenzepine they were 20.0 an 69.0%, respectively; the differences in healing rates for the two drugs were not statistically significant. Similarly both drugs provided satisfactory relief of pain. The incidence of untoward effects was 24.5% with telenzepine and 29.7% with pirenzepine, dryness of mouth being most prominent (20.4 vs. 19.3%). With telenzepine blurred vision was reported in a significantly lower rate compared to pirenzepine (0.7 vs. 4.2%, p less than 0.05). Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory tests were not observed. The present study shows for the first time that the newly developed antimuscarinic drug telenzepine is in a single nocturnal dosage regimen (3 mg nocte) as effective as pirenzepine (50 mg bid) in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.", 
    "19": "Triazolam is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. To determine how it was being prescribed and used, we examined triazolam use in patients who had received the drug for greater than six weeks. We reviewed medical charts of 72 adult male patients from an ambulatory Veterans Administration population who had received a 30-day triazolam prescription with at least one refill. Results showed that although prescribed daily doses of triazolam were generally appropriate for the age of the patient being treated, the average length of therapy was 6.2 months. Seventy-five percent of the prescriptions had been written for a one-month supply with five refills. Neither prescriber specialty nor level of training was significantly related to length of therapy. Thirty-nine of the patients (54 percent) were available for a telephone interview to determine how the drug was actually being used and the adverse effects profile. Over 60 percent claimed to be taking the drug every night, 95 percent at the dose prescribed. Sixty-seven percent of the patients taking triazolam nightly reportedly did not sleep as well if they tried a night without the drug. Apart from effects on sleep, dizziness and confusion were the most commonly reported adverse effects. As a result of this study, automatic stop orders on discharge were implemented to limit triazolam therapy to inpatient stays. Physicians must evaluate the need for continued hypnotic therapy so that a longer-acting agent like flurazepam may be used if chronic medication is necessary.", 
    "20": "Transient amnesias, fugues, twilight states, automatisms, depersonalization, and furors or explosive disorders can occur in association with, or be caused by, various medications or substance-induced organic brain states. Agents capable of precipitating dissociative-like states include alcohol, barbiturates and similarly acting hypnotics, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, clioquinol, beta-adrenergic blockers, marijuana and certain psychedelic drugs, general anesthetics, and others. The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance. They provide a unique opportunity for the study of mind-brain relationships and should be included in psychiatric nosology.", 
    "21": "Mania is a psychiatric illness that often requires immediate intervention, and the pregnant manic patient presents a therapeutic dilemma. Use of psychotropic medications during pregnancy may cause three complications: teratogenesis, neonatal toxicity, and behavioral toxicity. The literature contains few well-controlled studies for psychotropic medications in bipolar or other psychiatric populations and those often lack a control group or do not consider confounding factors such as other drug use. Pharmacologic alternatives include antipsychotics, lithium, carbamazepine, and benzodiazepines. Although studies and case reports describe fetal malformations in infants exposed in utero to psychotropic medications, the data are conflicting as to the nature of anomalies and risk of their occurrence. Malformations can occur in almost every organ system; however, the cardiovascular type are of major concern after lithium exposure during the first trimester and oral clefts after benzodiazepine exposure. Antipsychotic exposure can produce extrapyramidal symptoms in the neonate and lithium has been associated with neonatal cyanosis, lethargy, flaccidity, and non-toxic goiter. A neonatal abstinence syndrome has occurred after maternal benzodiazepine consumption. Behavioral toxicity is more difficult to assess, as long-term follow-up is needed. To date, evidence for behavioral toxicity in children exposed to lithium or antipsychotics in utero is lacking. Few specific guidelines for using psychotropic medications in an acutely manic pregnant patient exist. Current symptoms, past response, and the stage of gestation all must be considered. Complete elimination of symptoms may not be the goal. A team approach is essential in treatment of such a complex and challenging patient.", 
    "22": "Midazolam is a water soluble benzodiazepine with potent sedative and amnestic properties. Sixty unpremedicated patients who were to undergo upper endoscopy for diagnostic purposes were enrolled in an open, non-randomized study to assess the efficacy of 4 increasing dosages of midazolam (0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg). Efficacy measures included Trieger test (psychomotor drawing), presence of anterograde amnesia, patient rating (PR) of the sedation, evidence of inflammation at the site of the injection and physician's global assessment (PGA). The 4 patient groups were similar in age, sex and ASA class. Eight of the 15 patients who received the 0.05 mg/kg and 1 patient each in the 0.10 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg group were considered to be treatment failures and required supplemental diazepam. PR (excellent-good) was constant for all doses throughout. Nearly all patients had anterograde amnesia. Deterioration in the Trieger test results was associated with increasing dose (ANOVA, p less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in vital signs. Signs of phlebitis were noted in two patients who received both diazepam and midazolam. PGA rating rose from 26.7% (0.05 mg/kg) to 80.0% (0.20 mg/kg) (p less than 0.01). Few adverse effects (unrelated to dosage) were noted. Midazolam is a well tolerated benzodiazepine which provides satisfactory sedation for endoscopy. If no premedication is given, there are no benefits to be gained from using a dose greater than 0.10 mg/kg.", 
    "23": "Phenylpropanolamine is a sympathomimetic agent present in over 100 proprietary and prescription anorectics, nasal decongestants, psychostimulants and treatments for premenstrual syndrome. It is often found in street drugs prepared to look like amphetamines. Phenylpropanolamine has precipitated paranoid psychosis, severe anxiety, cerebrovascular accidents and hypertensive crises. Hypertensive crises can be treated with phentolamine. Psychiatric symptoms and anxiety are managed with benzodiazepines.", 
    "24": "The safety and efficacy of premedication with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) was compared with that of an orally administered solution of meperidine, diazepam, and atropine and no premedication in 59 children about to undergo elective operations. The patients were randomly assigned to receive no premedication (n = 19); 0.25 ml/kg of the oral solution (containing meperidine, 1.5 mg/kg, diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg, and atropine, 0.02 mg/kg, n = 20); or OTFC (15-20 micrograms/kg, n = 20). Children had activity (sedation) and anxiety scores, vital signs (including systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures and heart and respiratory rates) and pulse oximetry determined oxygen saturation measured before and at 10-min intervals after premedication until they were taken to the operating room. Quality of induction and recovery was evaluated using scoring schedules; recovery times were measured and side effects noted. OTFC was readily accepted and provided significant reductions in preoperative activity (sedation) and anxiety starting after 30 min. After OTFC, sedation and anxiolysis were significantly greater than in children having no premedication but similar to children having the oral solution for premedication. Vital signs and oxygen saturations remained unchanged preoperatively in all groups. Induction and recovery evaluations and recovery times were similar in the three groups, although children having OTFC had the lowest requirements for narcotics in the recovery room. OTFC caused an 80% incidence of mild preoperative facial pruritus and a higher overall incidence of postoperative vomiting (37%) than premedication with the oral solution (5%) or no premedication (18%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

As many as 40.5% patients were less than 20 years of age, while 2.7% were over 30 years of age. 48.7% had antepartum convulsions, 40.5% had intrapartum convulsions, while 8 patients convulsed in the postpartum period. Besides standard management of eclamptic patients, 3 protocols of anticonvulsant therapy were utilised. 27% were managed with diphenyl hydantoin sodium, 43% with magnesium sulphate, and 30% by combination of diazepam and pentazocine. The maternal and perinatal outcome was evaluated. Control of convulsions was superior with magnesium sulphate while perinatal outcome was best with diphenyl hydantoin.", 
    "27": "1. Graded doses of bombesin infused I.V. into conscious rats with chronic pancreatic fistulae induced a dose-dependent stimulation of protein secretion, similar to that obtained with caerulein. This stimulation does not appear to be mediated by cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors because peptidergic (CR-1409) and non-peptidergic (L-364718) CCK antagonists failed to affect protein secretion at a dose range which caused almost complete suppression of caerulein-induced pancreatic secretion. 2. Studies in vitro on isolated rat pancreatic acini revealed that caerulein, pentagastrin and bombesin all showed the same efficacy in their ability to stimulate amylase release. In contrast, CCK antagonists competitively inhibited amylase release induced by caerulein and pentagastrin but not by bombesin or urecholine, indicating that the latter two agents act directly on acinar cells via receptors which are separate from those involved in stimulation induced by caerulein and pentagastrin. 3. DNA synthesis, measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, was significantly stimulated by caerulein, soybean trypsin inhibitor (FOY 305), pentagastrin and by bombesin in a dose-dependent manner. CCK receptor antagonists prevented stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by caerulein, FOY 305 and pentagastrin but not by bombesin. 4. This study indicates that bombesin strongly stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion, with an efficacy similar to that of caerulein, and also exerts a potent growth-promoting action on the pancreas, both effects appearing to be mediated by mechanisms independent of the CCK receptors.",

    "29": "Substance abusing patients with significant psychiatric disorders can present unique legal vulnerabilities for treatment professionals. The tendency within the chemical dependency community to treat patients uniformly can militate against the individualized treatment planning that satisfies legal obligations to act in the best interest of the patient. The failure to adequately consider both the psychiatric disorder and substance abuse problem may create legal vulnerabilities that issue from the failure to refer a patient in need of medication or the failure to prevent the suicide of a patient in a situation where suicide is preventable. Patients suffering harm from acts of commission or omission of a chemical dependency treatment specialist have recourse through laws regarding negligence. Variations in the backgrounds and training of care providers create problems for the harmed patient in establishing a standard of care for the treatment of chemical dependence. However, the psychological symptoms of the dual diagnosis patient make it easier to establish a standard of care that may be legally cognizable. The chemical dependency specialist--of whatever discipline--has a duty to patients that requires sound assessment and disposition.", 
    "30": "1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-3-hydroxyl-7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-(O-fluorophenyl)-2H - 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (doxefazepam, SAS 643, Doxans) was investigated in a series of toxicological studies. Oral LD50 values were greater than 2000 mg/kg in mice, rats and dogs, while endoperitoneal LD50 values were 746 and 544 mg/kg in the mice and rats, respectively, and greater than 1000 mg/kg in the dogs. Subacute and chronic studies in rats and dogs evidenced a transient ataxia after administration of the test compound, which was dose-dependent in the subacute experiment, and occurred only at the highest dose in the chronic studies. No pathological findings were registered at necropsy or in microscopic observations, except an increase of liver weight at the highest dosage in the chronic study in the rat. Doxefazepam did not exert any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits. Moreover in rats it did not alter the reproductive performance. The mutagenic studies did not reveal any mutagenic potential. In the cancerogenicity study in rats doxefazepam did not show positive carcinogenic potential.", 
    "31": "The modulatory effects of opioids on urine production in adult rats have been well-documented. We report here the first investigation of the effects of these agents on urination in neonatal rats. The kappa-agonists U50,488H (1,10 mg kg-1) and (+)-tifluadom (10 mg kg-1) produced an increase in urine output in 10-day old pups whereas the (-)-isomer of tifluadom was ineffective in this model. The diuretic effects of the highest dose of U50,488H were attenuated by a 10 but not a 1 mg kg-1 dose of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. These findings suggest that kappa-agonists, as in adult animals, produce diuresis in neonates by activity at kappa-opioid receptors and also confirm the stereoselective nature of the response. The increase in urination produced by U50,488H (10 mg kg-1) was also reduced by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 mg kg -1), an observation which supports the hypothesis that kappa-agonists--in addition to their well-established inhibitory effects on the release of antidiuretic hormone--may increase urination via an adrenergic mechanism at the level of the adrenal medulla. The mu-opioid agonist morphine (0.1-10 mg kg-1), in contrast to its observed effects in older animals, did not produce antidiuresis in either normally-hydrated or water-loaded 10-day old rat pups. The results of this study therefore show that the stimulatory effects of kappa-agonists on urine production appear to be fully-functional at 10-days but the inhibitory effects of opioids on urination lag behind in development.", 
    "32": "The results of therapeutic trials in functional dyspepsia (FD), a frequently encountered condition, are contradictory. Our aim, then, was to produce a pooled estimate, or meta-analysis, of a series of short-term randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials on the pharmacological treatment of FD with antisecretory and gastrokinetic drugs. We retrieved trials for analysis purposes by consulting computerized data bases and by scanning published reviews, Current Contents, and references cited in the individual studies. We also requested bibliographical updates from the medical departments of the manufacturers of the drugs used in the various trials. Of 74 trials retrieved by these means, 23 proved eligible for meta-analysis on the basis of six selection criteria defined a priori. Results were expressed in terms of \"therapeutic success\" (TS), which includes \"symptom-free patients,\" patients with \"significant improvement in symptoms,\" \"excellent results,\" and so on. The differences in TS rates between the various drugs and placebo were calculated in each trial as the algebraic difference together with the respective 95% confidence interval (95% C.I.); the pooling of results of all eligible trials was done using Cochran's weighted method. With antisecretory drugs, the mean difference in TS rates versus placebo was +20% (95% C.I.: 14-24%). The therapeutic gain for the respective antisecretory agents was 25% (95% C.I.: 14-36%) in the case of pirenzepine and 18% (95% C.I.: 12-24%) in the case of H2 antagonists. Meta-analysis of trials with gastrokinetic drugs also showed superior efficacy of these agents compared with placebo, with a mean difference in TS rates of +46% (95% C.I.: 40-52%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Methadone is described in this review as a potent analgesic agent; in Germany it is seldom administered as a therapeutic agent. It has the following pharmacokinetic properties: high lipophilicity, large volume of distribution (initial and steady state), low clearance (hepatic capacity limited) with a long terminal elimination time, high bioavailability following oral administration, and a tendency to accumulate in the blood and tissues. The review also considers pharmacodynamic aspects of methadone, which in Germany is available only in the levo-rotatory form; all the effects are conditioned by this l-enantiomer. In other countries methadone is successfully used over the following range of indications: intra- and postoperative pain (intravenous and epidural administration), cancer pain, and non-malignant painful conditions. The concepts of minimal effective analgesic concentration in the blood plasma (MEAC) and concentration required for 50% relief on pain are discussed. The MEAC is lower for the l-isomer than for the racemate. Methadone alone is a good analgesic agent that has slight effects in the form of respiratory depression, to which partial tolerance builds up in the course of long-term use of the drug. The interaction between methadone with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates can be dangerous.", 
    "34": "Respiratory depression after intravenous anesthesia is supposed to be related to vigilance. This hypothesis could not yet be tested because of the lack of methods measuring continuously important parameters of respiration without altering the patient's vigilance. Pulse Oximetry offers this possibility. The following study was performed to investigate the effects of the Benzodiazepine Antagonist Flumazenil (Anexate) on parameters of vigilance and respiration after Midazolam/Fentanyl anesthesia.", 
    "35": "40 healthy patients aged 18-65 years who were to undergo arthroscopy were randomly assigned to Flumazenil (Group F) or no Flumazenil = Control (Group C). All patients received 7.5-10 mg Midazolam, 0.3-0.6 Fentanyl, 4-6 mg Vecuronium, were intubated and ventilated with 8 ml/kg BW VT x 12/min - N2O/O2 = 2:1. At the end of operation Group F received 0.3-0.5 mg Flumazenil. When adequate spontaneous ventilation was restored the patients were extubated and brought to a single bed room where they were monitored and observed without being disturbed, except at the arrival time (T1), 15 min (T2) and 30 min (T3) when blood pressure was measured and the pain score was asked. The following parameters were registered: Transcutaneous Oxygen Saturation (SAT) and Heart Rate (HR) continuously, Sedation (every minute) and Reactions to acoustic or verbal stimuli in the case of hypoxemia. The two groups were compared with respect to the number and severity of hypoxic events/15 min, the mean degree of sedation (6 point scale) and the number of adequate reactions to the acoustic alarm resp. instruction: \"Take a deep breath!\"", 
    "36": "Wilcoxon Test, Chi-Square test (p less than or equal to 0.05) is significant).", 
    "37": "The groups were comparable with respect to their anthropometric data, dosages of Midazolam and Fentanyl, and perioperative blood pressures. Parameters of vigilance: Group F was less sedated than Group C (p = 0.052) and reacted better to the verbal instruction to take a deep breath in the case of hypoxia (p less than or equal to 0.05). Parameters of respiration: Hypoxic states occurred more frequently in group F (p = 0.098) and lasted longer. The severeness was significantly more pronounced in group F (p less than or equal to 0.05). There were no complications and the patients acceptance of the anesthetic procedure was high.", 
    "38": "The hypothesis that postoperative respiratory depression is related to the degree of vigilance cannot be accepted. In contrast there is a strong evidence that under special conditions patients can be in a relatively high degree of vigilance and do not breathe with subsequent severe hypoxemia. The possible u", 
    "39": "To investigate the effects of the 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam, on LH secretion in normal men, LH pulsatile secretion was defined after oral administration of 40 mg of clobazam or a placebo to 6 healthy male volunteers, according to a randomized cross-over design. LH pulse frequency increased significantly from a mean of 3.8 (range 3-5) pulses/8 h after placebo, to a mean of 5 (range 4-7) pulses/8 h (P less than 0.05), after clobazam. Mean LH concentrations and peak amplitudes did not change significantly. These results suggest that clobazam mediates its effects on LH secretion at the hypothalamic level by increasing the frequency of episodic GnRH release.", 
    "40": "We examined the prevalence and characteristics of drug use in a large sample of fatally and nonfatally injured trauma victims. Routinely collected urine specimens from 452 emergency room patients and 160 persons autopsied at the Medical Examiner's Office (MEO) were analyzed for the presence of marijuana, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines using EMIT enzyme immunoassays. Blood alcohol levels were also measured. Tests were positive for at least one drug in 40.3% of the ER and 18.7% of the MEO samples. Marijuana was the most commonly detected drug in both groups. Specimens were more likely to be positive in younger persons and in males, and in victims of assaults and traffic accidents. Alcohol was present in the blood in more than one third of ER and MEO samples. Only 39.8% of ER samples and 52.3% of MEO samples were negative for both alcohol and drugs.", 
    "41": "Healthy adult volunteers (n = 52) received single oral doses of flurazepam hydrochloride (15 mg), temazepam (15 mg), triazolam (0.25 mg), or placebo in a parallel, double-blind study. Sedative effects were greatest with triazolam, followed next by temazepam; peak effects closely coincided with peak plasma concentrations. Differential recovery from sedation corresponded in part to differences in mean elimination halflife, although sedative effects returned to baseline before plasma drug concentrations became undetectable. Sedation following flurazepam administration was less intense than with triazolam and temazepam. When tested at three hours after dosing, none of the active treatments impaired learning of a 16-item word list. However, at 24 hours, triazolam recipients could not recall a significant fraction of what was learned. Thus, dynamic differences among three benzodiazepine hypnotics may be partly explained by kinetic differences, as well as, we should caution, by possible \"clinical inequivalence\" in dosage.", 
    "42": "Acute anxiety reactions have been reported following antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced sedation. In this study, the level of sedation and anxiety was assessed in 30 patients randomly assigned to receive either saline or flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) after midazolam sedation according to a double-blind protocol. Carefully titrated doses of flumazenil, 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg (mean +/- SD), effectively reversed residual midazolam-induced sedation without producing significant changes in the patients' level of anxiety. In addition, plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, and beta-endorphin concentrations were measured in a subset of patients (n = 5) from each group. The levels of these stress hormones did not acutely change following flumazenil (or saline). These results indicate that flumazenil, 0.6-1.0 mg iv, can antagonize midazolam sedation without producing acute anxiety or evidence of a stress response.", 
    "43": "The interaction between nitrous oxide and diazepam was assessed in the mouse staircase test. In this paradigm, the numbers of rears (NR) (simultaneous standing on hindlegs and sniffing the air) and steps ascended (NSA) reflect anxiety and locomotor activity, respectively. Antianxiety drugs characteristically reduce NR but not NSA, while sedative drugs reduce both NR and NSA in generally parallel fashion. In this study, increasing concentrations of nitrous oxide alone produced progressively greater and statistically significant increases in NSA. Nitrous oxide alone had no significant effect on NR until, at a concentration of 75%, it decreased NR. Diazepam alone decreased NR equally and significantly at all doses. With certain combinations of concentration and dose, nitrous oxide enhanced the effect of diazepam on NR without altering NSA. These findings suggest that nitrous oxide can increase the antianxiety effect of diazepam without increasing its sedative effect in the mouse staircase paradigm.", 
    "44": "An imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid-ergic neurotransmission has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. For further evaluation of this hypothesis, several parameters of amino acid-ergic neurotransmission were studied in rats with acute liver failure induced by the administration of 300 mg per kg thioacetamide by gavage on two consecutive days. By appropriate supportive care, hypoglycemia, renal failure and hypothermia were avoided. Rats were monitored clinically and neurologically. Hepatic encephalopathy evolved in four distinct, easily recognizable stages. Light and electron microscopic examination of brains of rats with hepatic encephalopathy revealed only a slight swelling of nuclei of neurons and astrocytes without signs of neuronal degeneration or brain edema. In rats with hepatic encephalopathy, the concentrations of GABA, glutamate and taurine were decreased in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus and the striatum, whereas those of aspartate and glycine were unchanged or increased. GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors were studied as parameters for the postsynaptic GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, glutamic acid decarboxylase as parameter for presynaptic GABA-ergic neurons and stimulation of benzodiazepine binding by GABA as a parameter for a GABA-mediated postsynaptic event. None of these parameters was different in hepatic encephalopathy as compared to controls. Similarly, Ca++/Cl(-)-dependent and -independent glutamate receptors as parameters for glutamatergic neurons were unchanged in rats with hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, in rats with thioacetamide-induced liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy, changes of the concentrations of neurotransmitter amino acids occur in the brain. Other neurochemical parameters, however, failed to identify alterations of GABA-ergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission in hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "45": "Central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine (BD) receptors were labelled either by 3H-flunitrazepam or 3H-Ro 5-4864 in vitro after stress and in vivo administration of GABAA and GABAB agonists. A significant increase in the density of cerebral cortex and kidney BD binding sites was observed in rats after forced swimming stress. Similar changes in both type of BD receptors were also followed when naive (stressed) and handling-habituated (unstressed) rats were used. Stress in both models was unable to change the affinity of BD receptors in cerebral cortex, but significantly lowered it in kidneys. Acute treatment of rats with muscimol (1.5 mg/kg) or (-)baclofen (5 mg/kg) resulted in marked increase in the affinity of BD binding not only in cerebral cortex but also in kidneys. After (-)baclofen treatment the number of BD binding sites was lowered in the structures studied. In a separate study mice selected according to their behavioral response to (-)baclofen (1 mg/kg) were studied. Two weeks after the selection it appeared that baclofen responders were behaviorally more \"anxious\" than baclofen nonresponders. The number of BD binding sites was reduced in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, heart and kidneys in baclofen responders as compared to baclofen nonresponders. In several cases the changes in peripheral BD binding sites were even more pronounced than those in central ones. The data presented here evidence that peripheral- and central-type BD receptors are regulated similarly by GABA and some models of stress. The physiological mechanisms involved in similar regulation of central- and peripheral-type BD receptors are yet unknown.", 
    "46": "In our experiments the isolated rat adrenal glomerulosa cells displayed peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, which could bind to [3H] PK11195 with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 9.4 +/- 2.8 nmol/L and a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 5.6 +/- 1.8 pmol/10(6) cells. The effects of five ligands: PK11195, Ro5-4846, flunitrazepam, diazepam and clonazepam on aldosterone secretion responses of isolated glomerulosa cells to angiotensin II or extracellular potassium ions were observed. The logarithm of EO50 for these ligands as stimulators was well correlated with the logarithm of their Ki value for [3H] PK11195 binding, suggesting that the stimulative effects might be mediated by the benzodiazepine receptor in isolated glomerulosa cells.", 
    "47": "Several N-benzhydryl-tryptamines and 1,1-diphenyl-tetrahydro-beta-carbolines were synthetized and the requisites for their formation were established. Crystallographic and conformational analyses were carried out on selected compounds and the affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptors was measured.", 
    "48": "An endogenous brain ligand which competes with [3H]-flunitrazepam for the binding to benzodiazepine receptor has been isolated and purified to homogeneity. The purification procedures involve the extraction of the endogenous ligand by homogenizing the brain tissue in water containing various protease inhibitors followed by filtration through a PM 10 membrane (exclusion limit: 10,000-dalton), column chromatographies on Sephadex G-50, Bio-Rad P2 and a series of C18 reverse phase HPLC columns. The purified endogenous ligand was eluted as a single and symmetrical peak monitored at either 220 or 280 nm. Furthermore, the ligand activity coincided with the absorption peak. The purified endogenous ligand is thermostable, insensitive to various peptidases and proteolytic enzymes, resistant to DNAse, RNAse, and carbohydrate enzyme e.g. neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18) and acid treatment. It has a major absorption peak at 220 nm and a minor one at 313 nm. The endogenous ligand appears to be quite specific since it only inhibits the binding of ligand to the central type benzodiazepine receptor but not to other receptors, e.g. peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor, alpha 1-adrenoceptor, alpha 2-adrenoceptor, beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Furthermore, the inhibition of the receptor binding by the endogenous ligand is enhanced by GABA suggesting that the endogenous ligand is a benzodiazepine receptor agonist. The structure of the endogenous ligand is unknown.", 
    "49": "Clomethiazole (CLOM) is known to be an anticonvulsant drug and has been also reported to decrease serum prolactin (PRL) in humans. Both effects may be mediated by an enhancement of gabaergic transmission. In order to determine if (CLOM) interacts with GABA metabolism and/or at the GABA receptor level, we studied its effect on PRL release and on the binding of various compounds that interact with the GABAA-benzodiazepine-receptor complex. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of CLOM to rats significantly decreased PRL levels, and this effect was antagonized by IP administration of bicuculline, an antagonist of the GABAA receptor. In vitro, the inhibitory effect of muscimol on PRL release from rat hemiadenohypophysis was potentiated in a dose-dependent manner by preincubation with CLOM. This effect was antagonized by picrotoxin (10(-6) M). On the other hand, CLOM had no effect on GABA metabolism and did not compete with GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine binding sites in cortical membranes. CLOM competed, however, with the picrotoxin binding site labelled with [35S]-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), at an IC50 value of 1.2 x 10(-4) M, which is in the same range as some barbiturates. These results concerning PRL release and binding experiments with cortical membranes suggest that CLOM interacts with the picrotoxin/barbiturate site of the GABAA-receptor-chloride channel complex.", 
    "50": "The purpose of this study was to determine if alcohol abuse affects muscarinic cholinergic and benzodiazepine receptors in histologically normal brains obtained at autopsy in a general hospital population. Patients were excluded from this study if they had clinical brain (including Wernicke's) disease, died in coma, had liver disease, significant brain atrophy, or dementia severe enough to require institutionalization. We found that muscarinic cholinergic synaptic receptor density determined with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was decreased by 40% in homogenates of the putamen of 27 alcohol abusers compared with 37 matched nonalcoholic controls. In contrast, receptor densities and affinities of benzodiazepine receptors determined with [3H]flunitrazepam were not significantly different in the two groups. Age and death-autopsy time interval had no significant effects on either wet tissue protein concentrations, yields of protein after centrifugation, or receptor binding. The contributions of age and time interval were each less than 3% of the total variance of protein concentrations and receptor binding. When patients who had received cholinergic, anticholinergic, or benzodiazepine medications before death were excluded or included we observed no significant effects on the final results. Pneumonia, known to be associated with acute hypoxia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, known to be associated with chronic hypoxia, were approximately equally distributed between the two groups and had no significant effects on the results reported here. It is significant that the loss of muscarinic and the sparing of benzodiazepine receptors in the putamen occurs in histologically normal brains in the absence of significant atrophy and gross dementia. It implies that these changes are early in the development of alcoholic encephalopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The expression of cooperativity of pharmacological effects of convulsants--exogenic ligands of supramolecular GABA-receptor-channel ensemble (GABA-RC)--bicuculline, picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazole, bemegride at intravenous infusion to intact animals and against a background of administration of barbital-Na and phenazepam is determined. The supposed mechanism of bemegride effect is discussed. Analysis of principles of GABA-RC functioning in vivo on the base of pharmacological data (cooperativity coefficients and types of modulation of GABA-RC functions at the interaction of convulsants and their reverse agonists) suggests the formation of biosystem response at modification of structures adequate to one of four subunits of \"quartet\" (tetrameric) model of GABA-RC.", 
    "52": "The anatomical distribution of omega 3 (peripheral type benzodiazepine binding) sites in the immune system organs of the rat has been studied autoradiographically at both macroscopic and microscopic levels of resolution using either reversible or irreversible (UV irradiation) labeling with [3H]PK 14105. In thymus sections, [3H]PK 14105 labeled with high affinity (Kd, derived from saturation experiments = 10.8 nM) a single population of sites which possessed the pharmacological characteristics of omega 3 sites. In the thymus gland, higher omega 3 site densities were detected in the cortex than in the medulla; in these subregions, silver grains were associated to small (10-18 microns diameter) cells. In the spleen, omega 3 sites were more abundant in the white than in the red pulp. In the white pulp, silver grains were denser in the marginal zone than in the vicinity of the central artery and labeling was, as in the thymus, associated to small cytoplasm-poor cells. In the red pulp, omega 3 site associated silver grains were observed mainly in the Bilroth cords. In the lymph nodes, the medullary region showed a higher labeling than the surrounding follicles and paracortex. A significant accumulation of silver grains was observed in the lymph node medullary cords. In the intestine, Peyer patches were particularly enriched in omega 3 sites (especially in the periphery of the follicles). The distribution of omega 3 sites in the immune system organs suggests a preferential labeling of cells of T and monocytic lineages. This is consistent with the proposed immunoregulatory properties of some omega 3 site ligands.", 
    "53": "The interactions of binedaline (binodaline), a new antidepressant drug, and its main metabolites with neurotransmitter receptors and monoamine uptake sites were studied. In receptor binding assays, binedaline was compared to amitriptyline, imipramine, maprotiline and mianserin. Unlike these drugs binedaline did not show any significant affinity for an alpha adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, histamine H1 or serotonin2 (5-HT2) receptors. Binedaline and desmethylbinedaline were potent inhibitors of the uptake of norepinephrine in synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex (Ki = 25 and 29 nM, respectively). Binedaline also inhibited 5-HT uptake with a weak affinity (Ki = 847 nM) but was inactive as an inhibitor of dopamine uptake in synaptosomes from rat striatum (Ki greater than 2 microM). No specific binding was found using [3H]binedaline. After 2 weeks of daily administration of binedaline (20 mg/kg i.p.), the number of beta adrenergic recognition sites labeled with [3H]CGP 12177 remained constant in rat forebrain, as did 5-HT2 receptors and benzodiazepine receptors. In contrast a prolonged treatment with maprotiline (20 mg/kg i.p.) increased the apparent Kd value of [3H]CGP 12177 by 43% and the apparent maximal binding value of [3H]RO 15-1788 by 20% as compared to control. Our results indicate that binedaline is comparable to a tricyclic antidepressant drug in inhibiting the norepinephrine uptake but, however, it is devoid of affinity for neurotransmitter receptors. This probably explains why this drug does not induce the classical side effects of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. These results also suggest that a reduction in beta adrenergic, 5-HT2 or benzodiazepine receptors is not always related to an antidepressant chronic treatment.", 
    "54": "Activation of rat uterine myometrial muscarinic receptors with a variety of agonists results in increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism. Activation with carbachol is concentration- and time-dependent and is most apparent by following the accumulation of inositol monophosphate although there are small but significant increases of inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate. Carbachol stimulation of phospholipid turnover is greatest in the upper third of the uterus. The carbachol-induced increase of inositol monophosphate is antagonized by atropine and by the selective M-3 muscarinic receptor antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide. Pirenzepine, a selective M-1 receptor antagonist is less active, whereas gallamine and 11-2[[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one, selective M-2 receptor antagonists, are minimally effective suggesting that muscarinic M-3 receptors modulate phospholipid turnover in the rat myometrium. Displacement of tritium-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding by muscarinic antagonists also supports the presence of M-3 receptors in the uterus. Incubation with phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate significantly reduced the accumulation of inositol monophosphate induced by carbachol implying that protein kinase C might modulate the responsiveness of the M-3 receptors in the rat uterus. Our results suggest that the intracellular concentration of calcium required for the contraction of the rat myometrium may be modulated, in part, through M-3 muscarinic receptors coupled to phospholipase C-activated turnover of phosphoinositides.", 
    "55": "I report how some adulterants affect results for drugs of abuse in urine as measured by Roche RIA, Syva emit d.a.u., and Abbott TDx fpia (fluorescence polarization immunoassay) for the following drugs: amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine (PCP). Sodium chloride interfered negatively with all of these drugs when assayed by emit and caused a slight decrease in measured benzodiazepine concentration by fpia. Drug concentrations were also decreased by added H2O2 (emit: benzodiazepine), Joy detergent (emit: cannabinoid, benzodiazepines, PCP), NaHCO3 (emit: opiate; fpia: PCP), or NaClO [corrected] (emit, RIA, fpia: amphetamines, opiates, PCP; emit, fpia: cannabinoid; emit: benzodiazepines). False-positive results were caused by H2O2 (fpia: benzodiazepines) and Joy (RIA, fpia: benzodiazepine, cannabinoid; fpia: barbiturate, amphetamine). Sodium bicarbonate causes a suspiciously high pH in the urine, NaClO [corrected] an apparently low pH (using pH paper).", 
    "56": "The effects of a benzodiazepine receptor agonist and an antagonist on the MAC of halothane required to achieve anesthesia were evaluated to explore the possible functional interaction between halothane and the benzodiazepine receptor. Rats were anesthetized with halothane and then administered midazolam (a benzodiazepine agonist) and/or flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist). Flumazenil in doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg was found to have no effect on the MAC of halothane. Midazolam (1.0 mg/kg) lowered the MAC of halothane by 37%. This decrease in MAC was inhibited by coadministration of flumazenil. The absence of an increase in the MAC of halothane in the presence of flumazenil suggests that halothane does not interact with the benzodiazepine receptor, directly or indirectly, to produce its anesthetic action.", 
    "57": "Infantile spasms constitute a relatively rare disorder of infancy and early childhood; their onset is usually within the first 6 to 8 months of life. A large percentage of patients with this disorder (85-90 per cent) show various degrees of retardation. Infantile spasms typically occur in clusters immediately on arousal, or soon thereafter, but rarely occur while the infant is actually asleep. The usual interictal EEG pattern associated with infantile spasms is hypsarrhythmia, but infantile spasms may occur in the absence of this EEG pattern. The pathophysiology of infantile spasms is not known, but recent evidence suggests that certain regions in the brain stem that are associated with sleep cycling may be responsible for the clinical and EEG manifestations of this disorder. At present, the only known effective treatment for infantile spasms is ACTH or corticosteroids. The therapeutic efficacy of these two agents is relatively equal, and one drug may be effective if the other drug fails. The effectiveness of certain traditional anticonvulsants (valproic acid and the benzodiazepines) and pyridoxine in the treatment of infantile spasms has not been adequately assessed. The long-term mental and developmental outcome of patients with infantile spasms is poor. The only factor that appears to be important in terms of long-term outcome is whether the patient is initially classified as cryptogenic or symptomatic, with the cryptogenic patients having the better outcomes. Approximately half of the infantile spasm patients will continue to have other types of seizures after their spasms stop.", 
    "58": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor was purified several thousandfold by affinity chromatography from rat cerebellum, adult cortex, and neonatal cortex. Competition for the benzodiazepine binding site by CL 218872 indicated that cerebellar receptors were predominantly type I, adult cortical receptors were a mixture of subtypes, and neonatal cortex was enriched in type II receptor. The receptor purified from neonatal cortex contained predominantly a 54-kilodalton (kDa), beta-subunit-like protein, whereas receptors from cerebellum and adult cortex contained nearly equal amounts of a 50-kDa, alpha-subunit-like protein and a 54-kDa polypeptide. Peptide maps of trypsin-digested 54-kDa subunits from cerebellum, adult cortex, and neonatal cortex exhibited very similar profiles, a result indicating considerable homology between these proteins in the receptor subtypes. A 59-kDa subunit protein was detected in the receptor complex purified from neonatal cortex. Like the 50-kDa, alpha-subunit of the type I receptor, this protein was photolabeled with [3H]flunitrazepam. The photolabeled peptide fragments, produced by trypsin digestion of these alpha 50- and alpha 59-subunits, exhibited the same retention times on reverse-phase HPLC. A less highly purified GABAA receptor preparation from adult rat spinal cord possessed characteristics that were very similar to those of the receptors purified from neonatal cortex.", 
    "59": "The effects of acute and chronic administration of a subconvulsive dose of picrotoxin on t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([3S]TBPS), [3H]muscimol, and [3H]flunitrazepam binding characteristics in various regions and on the convulsant potency of picrotoxin in Sprague-Dawley rats were examined. Acute administration of a subconvulsive dose of picrotoxin (3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased [35S]TBPS and [3H]muscimol binding in cerebellum (CB) with no change in frontal cortex (FC). In rats treated chronically with picrotoxin (3 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 10 days), the Bmax of [35S]TBPS binding site was significantly decreased in the FC, striatum (ST), and CB with no change in KD values. Neither [3H]muscimol binding in the FC and CB nor [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the FC was affected in these rats. In addition, the potency of pentobarbital to inhibit [35S]TBPS binding in vitro was not altered following acute or chronic treatment of picrotoxin. Chronic administration of picrotoxin did not affect convulsive ED50 or LD50 of picrotoxin; however, it delayed the onset of convulsions and increased the time to death. These results suggest that treatment with picrotoxin at a subconvulsive dose for 10 days causes down-regulation of [35S]TBPS binding sites and that this down-regulation might be related, at least in part, to the decreased extent of convulsant potency of picrotoxin. In addition, the results indicate possible interaction between convulsant binding sites and GABAA receptor sites in the CB following picrotoxin treatment.", 
    "60": "In the present study, we characterized the distribution and the pharmacological properties of the different components of the GABAA receptor complex in the brain of the eel (Anguilla anguilla). Benzodiazepine recognition sites labeled \"in vitro\" with [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNT) were present in highest concentration in the optic lobe and in lowest concentration in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. A similar distribution was observed in the density of gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) binding sites. GABA increased the binding of [3H]FNT in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal enhancement of 45% above the control value, and, vice versa, diazepam stimulated the binding of [3H]GABA to eel brain membrane preparations. The density of benzodiazepine and GABA recognition sites and their reciprocal regulation were similar to those observed in the rat brain. In contrast, the binding of the specific ligand for the Cl- ionophore, t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), to eel brain membranes was lower than that found in the rat brain. In addition, [35S]TBPS binding in eel brain was less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of GABA and muscimol and much more sensitive to the stimulatory effect of bicuculline, when compared with [35S]TBPS binding in the rat brain. Moreover, the uptake of 36Cl- into eel brain membrane vesicles was only marginally stimulated by concentrations of GABA or muscimol that significantly enhanced the 36Cl- uptake into rat brain membrane vesicles. Finally, intravenous administration of the beta-carboline inverse agonist 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (20 mg/kg) and of the chloride channel blocker pentylenetetrazole (80 mg/kg) produced convulsions in eels that were antagonized by diazepam at doses five to 20 times higher than those required to produce similar effects in rats. The results may indicate a different functional activity of the GABA-coupled chloride ionophore in the fish brain as compared with the mammalian brain.", 
    "61": "Increased neural inhibition appears to be an important component of the syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy. The pathways subserved by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex are the principal inhibitory systems in the mammalian brain. Hyperpolarization of neural membranes is accomplished by an increase in transmembrane chloride flux through a GABA-gated chloride channel in the complex. The opening of the chloride channel is induced by the binding of GABA to its receptors, and it is potentiated by barbiturates or benzodiazepines that act at distinct recognition sites on the complex. Involvement of the GABA neurotransmitter system in hepatic encephalopathy is suggested by several findings in animal models of fulminant hepatic failure. For example, hepatic encephalopathy resembles encephalopathies induced by drugs (including benzodiazepines) that potentiate GABAergic neurotransmission. In addition, neurons from animals with hepatic encephalopathy show increased sensitivity to benzodiazepine and GABA receptor agonists. Moreover, these neurons are excited by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists at concentrations that do not affect control neurons. Also, elevated levels of a substance that inhibits radioligand binding to benzodiazepine receptors have been found in cerebrospinal fluid from animals with hepatic encephalopathy. Furthermore, manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy can be ameliorated by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. The relevance of these findings to hepatic encephalopathy in human beings is supported by clinical observations showing that a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist can lessen the degree of hepatic encephalopathy. These findings suggest that an endogenous substance with benzodiazepine-like properties contributes to the neuropsychiatric manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy by augmenting GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "62": "Quinolinic acid (QA) lesions of neurons in cat visual cortex were combined with conventional in vitro autoradiographic methods in order to define the cellular locus of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). Animals of various postnatal ages had QA unilaterally injected into the visual cortex. Four to fourteen days later they were sacrificed and processed for electron microscopy (EM) or in vitro autoradiography. QA lesions at the various postnatal ages were found to eliminate intrinsic cortical neurons and their processes while leaving intact glia, fibers of passage and axon terminals from outside the lesion zone. Autoradiograms of visual cortex labelled with [3H]QNB (which labels M1 and M2 subtypes) showed an age-dependent loss of binding sites, with the greatest decreases occurring after 65 days postnatal. Examined separately, only the M1 mAChRs labelled with [3H]pirenzepine exhibited these age-dependent alterations. The results indicate a differential distribution of the M1 mAChRs during postnatal development. The loss of receptors late in postnatal life following QA suggests a dominantly neuronal locus; the relatively small loss early in postnatal life suggests a locus on other cellular elements.", 
    "63": "The experiments determined the ventilatory effects of epidurally injected morphine and sufentanil in rats in the absence and in the presence of chlordiazepoxide, a drug that may alleviate the effects of stress. Soon after administration of morphine as well as of sufentanil, ventilation was more profoundly depressed when rats had been pretreated with chlordiazepoxide. With chlordiazepoxide, respiratory depression after epidural injection of the longer acting and poorly lipid-soluble morphine could still be observed when analgesic activity had disappeared. The data are explained most parsimoniously by assuming that stress counteracts the respiratory effects of epidural opiates, and that late respiratory depression can occur in as much as the opiate continues to act at points of time when the effects of stress have disappeared.", 
    "64": "Treatment with the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, has been found to induce changes in both behavioral and endocrine circadian rhythms in hamsters. The objective of this study was to determine if these effects of triazolam could be generalized to other short-acting benzodiazepines. Therefore, the effects of midazolam on the biological clock of the hamster were examined in detail. A phase-response curve and a dose-response curve were measured to determine the effects of a single intraperitoneal injection of midazolam on the circadian clock of hamsters free-running in constant light. Midazolam injections produced maximal phase advances at circadian time (CT) 6 and 9 and maximal phase delays at CT 15 and 21. Doses of 2.5 mg or larger produced phase shifts that were significantly different from those produced by the vehicle controls. In addition, the phase-shifting effects of midazolam were completely blocked by administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, RO 15-1788, indicating that the phase-shifting actions of midazolam are mediated via benzodiazepine receptors. These results indicate that the previously reported effects of triazolam on the circadian clock can be generalized to other short-acting benzodiazepines.", 
    "65": "The quality of the anaesthesia and of the recovery (appreciated by Newman's test) of two anesthetic technics for colonoscopies are compared on two homogeneous groups from 50 patients each: propofol alone versus midazolam-alfentanyl association. The differences registered during anaesthesia, particularly concerning the breathing depression might be attributed to alfentanyl which has been used often at important doses. The recovery is delayed in the midazolam + alfentanyl's group in comparison with the propofol's group. The difference is very significant at 15 and 60 minutes. The use's safety and the fast recovery with propofol incite to advocate it as an unique+ anaesthetic agent for colonoscopies.", 
    "66": "It is reported that LY81067, a new diaryltriazine, possesses anticonvulsant properties against grand mal status epilepticus induced by intravenous administration of picrotoxin binding site ligands (Ro 5-4864 and pentylenetetrazole) in the baboon. Intravenous administration of LY81067 during the seizures blocked grand mal type electroencephalographic (EEG) paroxysmal discharges and led to a long electrical silence, progressively replaced by spike-and-wave discharges of low frequency (2 c/sec). A transient blocking effect was also observed when LY81067 was injected during grand mal status epilepticus induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate; however, the long electrical silence observed after administration of LY81067 was rapidly followed by grand mal type paroxysmal discharges in the EEG, which could be stopped by a subsequent injection of Ro 15-1788. However, LY81067 also displayed intrinsic epileptogenic properties. Administration of this drug alone led to the appearance of rhythmic EEG (2-3 c/sec) associated with myoclonia. Concomitantly with the EEG studies, interactions of all these drugs with benzodiazepine receptors were observed in vivo using [11C]Ro 15-1788 as radioligand and positron emission tomography (PET) as a non-invasive technique to measure the binding of the [11C]benzodiazepine antagonist in brain, in vivo. The [11C]Ro 15-1788 bound in the brain could not be displaced by the administration of LY81067 but rather, the [11C]antagonist binding in the brain was somewhat enhanced. Administration of pentylenetetrazole or Ro 5-4864 decreased the rate of wash-out of the radioligand. This fast effect of these two convulsant drugs was partially inhibited by the subsequent administration of LY81067. The concomitant blocking of the grand mal status epilepticus was also observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Inhalational anesthetic agents, particularly nitrous oxide, are potentially hazardous to both the patient and operating room personnel. Recent efforts have been directed towards the development of intravenous anesthetic techniques using combinations of a hypnotic with an analgesic. The hypnotic used in such a combination should have a short elimination half-life, little or no influence on hemodynamics, and no side effects. Benzodiazepines are likely candidates for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) since they combine hemodynamic stability and paucity of unwanted effects with the ability to induce amnesia for the entire perioperative period. They do have long elimination half-lives; even midazolam, the shortest-acting benzodiazepine, has a half-life of 2 to 3 h. This disadvantage might be counteracted by the use of flumazenil, the recently introduced, specifically acting benzodiazepine antagonist. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of rapid awakening following flumazenil after major abdominal surgery with benzodiazepine-fentanyl TIVA. Six patients (4 male, 2 female) scheduled for elective laparotomies participated in this pilot study. The average duration of surgery was 2.2 +/- 0.9 h. The patients were given 2 mg flunitrazepam p.o. the evening before surgery and 1 h before being brought to the operating room. Baseline pre-induction values were obtained 15 min after inserting catheters and attaching the EEG electrodes. Fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg) was given as a bolus injection followed by a rapid midazolam infusion. The infusion rate was calculated using the method of Wagner et. al. from the data of Lauven et al. to give plasma concentrations of 500 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "In 94 patients intubation by means of the fibre-optic bronchoscope was effected in various indication. Three different methods of anaesthesia were used: local anaesthesia + mild sedation; general anaesthesia + relaxation; sedation + analgesia. The experiences made with these methods--based on clinical observation and interrogation of the patients--reveal the special usefulness of local anesthesia for bronchoscopic intubation; this is probably the method of choice in practice.", 
    "69": "The experiments reported here were designed to characterize in detail the spectrum of activity of flunitrazepam in human sleep. The direct and residual effects of flunitrazepam, as well as the antagonism by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors, were studied in 28 normal subjects recorded in the sleep laboratory. The five categories of variables--sleep-wake balance, sleep organization, orthodox sleep, phasic events in sleep, and sleep waveforms--were all modified by flunitrazepam. Some of these modifications were observed only on the drug night and were antagonized by flumazenil, whereas others persisted in the placebo postdrug night and were not antagonized by flumazenil. A few variables showed changes intermediate between these two types of reactivity. The results do not fit well with the multiple benzodiazepine receptors theory, but instead support the concept of spare receptors. Along these lines, the study of the reactivity of sleep components to ligands of benzodiazepine receptors can contribute to the better understanding of the neuronal systems involved in their control.", 
    "70": "Single oral 10 mg doses of diazepam and demethyldiazepam were given on different occasions to 16 healthy subjects. The subjects included four poor hydroxylators of debrisoquin and three poor hydroxylators of mephenytoin. There was a correlation between the total plasma clearance of diazepam and demethyldiazepam (rs = 0.83; p less than 0.01). There was no relationship between benzodiazepine disposition and debrisoquin hydroxylation. Poor hydroxylators of mephenytoin had less than half the plasma clearance of both diazepam (p = 0.0008) and demethyldiazepam (p = 0.0001) compared with extensive hydroxylators of mephenytoin. The plasma half-lives were longer in poor hydroxylators than they were in extensive hydroxylators of mephenytoin for both diazepam (88.3 +/- SD 17.2 and 40.8 +/- 14.0 hours; p = 0.0002) and demethyldiazepam (127.8 +/- 23.0 and 59.0 +/- 16.8 hours; p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in volume of distribution of the benzodiazepines between the phenotypes. This study shows that the metabolism of both diazepam (mainly demethylation) and demethyldiazepam (mainly hydroxylation) is related to the mephenytoin, but not to the debrisoquin, hydroxylation phenotype.", 
    "71": "The anesthetic effects and interactions of midazolam and fentanyl were determined in terms of their reduction of enflurane MAC in dogs, and the effects of their specific antagonists were also investigated. Control enflurane MAC was determined by the tail clamp method in 18 mongrel dogs. Each animal then received an iv loading dose of midazolam followed by a constant infusion at 9.6 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 designed to produce a stable enflurane MAC reduction of approximately 40%, and enflurane MAC was determined following a 60-min observation period during which time the midazolam concentration in plasma stabilized. Fentanyl was then administered in a series of three incremental loading doses (15, 30, and 225 micrograms/kg) and infusions (0.05, 0.2, and 3.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) designed to produce enflurane MAC reductions of 30%, 50%, and 65%, respectively. Enflurane MAC was again determined following a 60-min observation period for each new infusion. In nine dogs after the fourth determination of enflurane MAC, fentanyl was discontinued and 1 mg/kg naloxone was administered iv every 10 min until enflurane MAC was determined for the last time. In the other nine dogs, midazolam was discontinued and 1.5 mg/kg flumazenil (RO 15-1788) was administered and enflurane MAC determined for the last time. The midazolam concentration in plasma remained stable at 414 +/- 134 ng/ml throughout the study, and in the absence of fentanyl reduced enflurane MAC by 40 +/- 10% (mean +/- SD). The addition of fentanyl produced significant further reductions in enflurane MAC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "We evaluated the effects of a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), 1 mg intravenous, on the hypoxic ventilatory response in 10 healthy patients who had received diazepam 0.97 +/- 0.34 mg/minute (mean +/- SD) for sedation during minor operative procedures. When assessed using a sedation analog scale, flumazenil significantly decreased diazepam-induced sedation. In only two of the five patients with evidence of diazepam-induced depression of the ventilatory response to hypoxia was there significant reversal of this depression after flumazenil administration. Finally, patients in whom the duration of sedation with diazepam was shorter (78 +/- 14 minutes) had a significantly greater decrease in the slope of their hypoxic ventilatory response curve (1.3 +/- 0.8 L.min-1.%sat-1 [-43% from baseline]) than did patients with longer sedation times (145 +/- 37 minutes duration; 2.0 +/- 0.8 L.min-1.%sat-1 [-5% from baseline]). These data suggest that flumazenil, 1 mg intravenous, is only partially effective in reversing diazepam-induced depression of hypoxic ventilatory drive and that tolerance may develop to the respiratory depressant effects of diazepam.", 
    "73": "Regulation of pancreatic gene expression by cholecystokinin (CCK) was examined in the rat using cloned cDNA probes to quantify changes in specific mRNAs (amylase, trypsinogen I, chymotrypsinogen B, and ribonuclease). Rats were administered intraduodenally an elemental liquid diet. Plasma CCK levels were raised to levels comparable to physiological postprandial levels either by intraduodenal perfusion with soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) (6.9 +/- 1.0 pM, n = 8) or by continuous intravenous infusion with cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8, 6.0 +/- 0.9 pM, n = 6). SBTI infusion resulted in fivefold increases in trypsinogen I and chymotrypsinogen B mRNA levels after 48 h. In contrast SBTI infusion had no effect on amylase mRNA levels and led to a decrease in ribonuclease mRNA levels to approximately 50% of control after 48 h. Intravenous infusion with CCK-8 for 24 h resulted in plasma levels of CCK comparable to those obtained with SBTI and had similar effects on digestive enzyme mRNA levels. These data suggested that SBTI acted via its ability to raise plasma CCK levels. To further test the specificity of these effects, animals were infused intraduodenally with the specific CCK receptor antagonist L364,718. Although the antagonist itself had no effect on digestive enzyme mRNA levels, antagonist treatment totally abolished the effects of both CCK infusion and SBTI treatment. These data therefore indicate that CCK regulates digestive enzyme gene expression at plasma concentrations comparable to physiological postprandial levels. Furthermore, the ability of SBTI infusion to increase plasma CCK accounts for its effects on pancreatic digestive enzyme mRNA levels.", 
    "74": "Acute in vitro exposure to ethanol and other intoxicant-anesthetics activates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated chloride channels and inhibits voltage-dependent calcium and sodium channels of isolated brain membranes. The question of whether these neurochemical actions are responsible for intoxication in vivo has been addressed using animal populations displaying genetic differences in sensitivity to alcohol and benzodiazepine intoxication. These genetic approaches include inbred strains, selected lines, recombinant inbred strains, and heterogeneous stocks. Genetic differences in ion channel function provide strong evidence for a role of the GABA-stimulated chloride channel in ethanol and benzodiazepine intoxication; the role of calcium and sodium channels is less clear.", 
    "75": "To drug-free urine specimens, we added the following drugs of abuse to give concentrations twice the cutoff value for positive test results: 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-carboxy-THC), oxazepam, secobarbital, morphine, benzoylecgonine, amphetamine, or phencyclidine (PCP). Visine was then added. Although measured concentrations of several drugs were decreased in the presence of Visine, false-negative results were obtained only for 9-carboxy-THC for the EMIT-d.a.u. and TDx urine cannabinoid assays. Visine also decreased 9-carboxy-THC as measured by the Abuscreen assay. At low concentrations of Visine, false-negative cannabinoid results were attributable to the benzalkonium chloride ingredient of Visine. The added Visine was not detectable by routine urine analysis and had no effect on the activity of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-drug conjugate used in the EMIT-d.a.u. assays. Moreover, analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed no chemical modification or loss of 9-carboxy-THC in the Visine-adulterated urine specimens. However, Visine did increase the adhesion of 9-carboxy-THC to the borosilicate glass specimen containers. Results of ultrafiltration studies with Visine suggest that 9-carboxy-THC partitions between the aqueous solvent and the hydrophobic interior of benzalkonium chloride micelles, thereby reducing the availability of 9-carboxy-THC in antibody-based assays.", 
    "76": "To survive, primates must detect danger in time to activate appropriate defensive behaviors. In this study, the defensive behaviors of infant rhesus monkeys exposed to humans were characterized. It was observed that the direction of the human's gaze is a potent cue for the infant. Infants separated from their mothers were active and emitted frequent distress vocalizations. When a human entered the room but did not look at the infant, it became silent and froze in one position. If the human stared at the infant, it responded with aggressive barking. Alterations of the opiate system affected the frequency of the infant's distress calls without affecting barking and freezing, whereas benzodiazepine administration selectively reduced barking and freezing. This suggests that opiate and benzodiazepine systems regulate specific defensive behaviors in primates and that these systems work together to mediate behavioral responses important for survival.", 
    "77": "Tourette syndrome is now widely accepted as a neurological disorder characterized by chronic multiple tics and uncontrollable sounds. The exact etiology of Tourette syndrome is still unknown, although an organic etiology is suspected. Hypotheses of the pathophysiologic mechanism of Tourette syndrome have generally included a component of neurotransmitter system \"imbalance\". Dopaminergic, cholinergic, serotoninergic, noradrenergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters have all been proposed as components of this \"imbalance\". The two most utilized agents, haloperidol and pimozide, decrease central dopaminergic activity by blocking dopamine receptors and have been shown to improve the symptomatology of Tourette syndrome. However, adverse effects limit their usefulness and new drugs that have fewer adverse effects and greater efficacy are needed. Some of the new therapeutic agents evaluated in Tourette syndrome are mentioned. The purpose of this paper is to provide physicians with guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of Tourette syndrome, based on the present available literature.", 
    "78": "L-365,260 (3R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepin-3-yl)-N'-(3-methylphenyl)urea), interacted in a stereoselective and competitive manner with guinea pig stomach gastrin and brain cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors. The affinity of L-365,260 for both gastrin (Ki = 1.9 nM) and brain CCK-B (Ki = 2.0 nM) receptors was greater than 2 orders of magnitude higher than its affinity for peripheral pancreatic CCK-A receptors or various other receptors. L-365,260 exhibited a similar high affinity for brain CCK-B receptors of rats, mice and man. A somewhat lower affinity for gastrin and brain CCK-B (IC50 = 20-40 nM) receptors was observed in dog tissues. In vivo, oral administration of L-365,260 antagonized gastrin-stimulated acid secretion in mice (ED50 = 0.03 mg/kg), rats (ED50 = 0.9 mg/kg) and guinea pigs (ED50 = 5.1 mg/kg). L-365,260 did not affect basal acid secretion and did not antagonize histamine- or carbachol-stimulated acid secretion in mice. L-365,260 represents a potentially powerful new tool for investigating gastrin and brain CCK-B receptors, and possibly their role in physiology and disease.", 
    "79": "The GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor has been solubilized from membrane preparations of bovine cerebral cortex and has been reconstituted, in a functionally active form, into phospholipid vesicles. In preliminary experiments, the receptor was labeled with the photoactive benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam prior to solubilization. A peptide of apparent molecular weight 53,500 was specifically labeled by this method, and this was used as a marker for the receptor during the reconstitution procedures. The labeled protein was solubilized with approximately 40% efficiency by 1% beta-octyl glucoside. Reconstitution was achieved by mixing the solubilized proteins with a 4:1 mixture of soybean asolectin and bovine brain phospholipids, followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-50-80 to remove detergent. The incorporation of the GABAA receptor into membrane vesicles has been verified by sucrose gradient centrifugation in which the [3H]-flunitrazepam-labeled peptide comigrated with [14C]phosphatidylcholine used as a lipid marker. Vesicles prepared without labeled markers retained the ability to bind both [3H]flunitrazepam and the GABA analogue [3H]muscimol. Furthermore, the binding parameters were very similar to those measured using native membrane preparations. A novel fluorescence technique has been used to measure chloride transport mediated by the GABAA receptor in reconstituted vesicles. Chloride influx was rapidly stimulated in the presence of micromolar concentrations of muscimol and was blocked by preincubation of the membranes with muscimol (desensitization). Flux was also blocked by pretreatment with the competitive GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline or with the noncompetitive GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin.", 
    "80": "In mice, Ro 15-4513 reduced the anaesthesia induced by ethanol and some other general depressant drugs, but was less effective against others. The order of potency was, from greatest reduction to least, ethanol, t-butanol, trichloroethanol, urethane, chlormethiazode, pentobarbitone. Of the two gaseous anaesthetics that were tested, ether anaesthesia was reduced but halothane was not. These results appeared independent of the doses of depressant or of Ro 15-4513; the effect of Ro 15-4513 in reducing ethanol anaesthesia was blocked by flumazenil (Ro 15-1788). It would appear that the benzodiazepine receptor complex is of importance in the induction of anaesthesia, most significantly with ethanol and to a diminishing degree with the other general depressants tested.", 
    "81": "Over a 12-month period in 1985-1986, 325 cases of deliberate self-poisoning were admitted to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. This survey confirms that deliberate self-poisoning remains common, accounting for 19.6% of all admissions to the intensive-care unit, and 5.4% of all medical-ward admissions. In 232 (71.4%) cases formal psychiatric consultation occurred, and some form of follow-up was organized in 227 (69.8%) cases. In the total group, the female-to-male ratio was 1.5 to one. In the 325 cases, a total of 489 substances was consumed. Benzodiazepine agents were consumed the most often (39.5% of all substances), followed by antidepressant drugs (11.7% of substances) and paracetamol (7.2% of substances). Barbiturate drugs, which previously have been shown to be prominent in deliberate self-poisoning, accounted for only 1.6% of the substances that were used in this survey. Alcohol was consumed in almost one-third (31.1%) of cases. The diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood was the most-frequent primary diagnosis (64.8% of diagnosed cases), followed by personality disorder (16.7% of diagnosed cases), schizophrenia (5.5% of diagnosed cases) and major depression (3.7% of diagnosed cases). Nearly one-half (46.8%) of all cases involved a past history of deliberate self-poisoning. Comparison of the results of this survey with those of past surveys shows that the profile of deliberate self-poisoning is changing. Barbiturate usage has declined markedly with a reciprocal increase in benzodiazepine usage. A review of the prescribing pattern of antidepressant agents in groups of individuals who are at high risk of deliberate self-poisoning is suggested in the light of the frequency of this phenomenon."
