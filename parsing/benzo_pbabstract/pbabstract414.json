    "0": "The development of selective, systemically active alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)/kainate antagonists over the last 4 years has enabled the role of this excitatory amino acid receptor subtype to be scrutinised in the different models of ischaemia. The animal models of cerebral ischaemia can be subdivided into two major categories: focal ischaemia, in which the resulting infarct resembles the clinical condition of stroke; and models of severe forebrain ischaemia, in which there is delayed neuronal degeneration of hippocampal CA1 neurones. The neuropathology in the latter models resembles the clinical condition seen following a cardiac arrest, for example. It is well established that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as MK-801, 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propenyl-1-phosphonate (CPPene), DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentanoic acid (CGP 37849), and N-(1-naphthyl)-N'-(3-ethylphenyl)-N'-methylguanidine hydrochloride (CNS 1102) are neuroprotective in animal models of focal ischaemia. However, in models of severe forebrain ischaemia NMDA antagonists produced only partial protection. The discovery of 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX) as a systemically active AMPA receptor antagonist enabled the role of this receptor subtype in ischaemia to be investigated. NBQX was shown to be neuroprotective against delayed neuronal degeneration of hippocampal CA1 neurones in animal models of severe forebrain ischaemia. Recent studies have demonstrated that NBQX administration can be delayed by up to 12 h and amelioration of delayed neuronal degeneration of hippocampal CA1 neurones can still be seen. NBQX has also been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of permanent and temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion. 1-(Aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466), a systemically active noncompetitive AMPA/kainate antagonist, was neuroprotective against focal ischaemia but was unable to attenuate hippocampal CA1 neuronal degeneration. Whilst the newer compounds such as (3SR,4aRS,6RS,8aRS)-6-[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl )-ethyl]-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY 215490) and 6-(1-imidazolyl)-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (YM900) have been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in focal ischaemia models, there is still a lack of information with regard to their efficacy in models of severe forebrain ischaemia. It appears from initial studies that AMPA/kainate antagonists have a better behavioural profile than NMDA antagonists in terms of a lack of phychostimulant and phychotomimetic effects. However, these antagonists have their own problems in that they cause severe depression of glucose utilisation in the central nervous system at neuroprotective doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The ability of CCKA antagonists to inhibit full and partial CCK agonists of the rat pancreatic acinar cell CCKA receptor has been studied. When isolated rat pancreatic acini were superfused with CCK-8 (10 pM-1 nM) or CCK-4 (1 microM), an increase in [Ca2+]i signal was initiated. Concurrent superfusion of either L-364,718 (0.1 microM) or lorglumide (10 microM), chemically distinct, specific, potent antagonists of the CCKA receptor, resulted in a rapid inhibition of the [Ca2+]i signal initiated by all concentrations of CCK-8. In contrast, Ca2+ oscillations, initiated by JMV-180 (25 nM-1 microM), a partial agonist analogue of CCK-8, were essentially unaffected by concurrent superfusion of either L-364,718 or lorglumide. When JMV-179, an analogue of JMV-180 that exhibits characteristics of a pure antagonist, was superfused concurrently with either CCK-8 or JMV-180, Ca2+ oscillations were inhibited, even in the presence of 0.1 microM L-364,718. In a similar fashion, amylase secretion stimulated by CCK-8 was markedly attenuated by L-364,718, lorglumide, and JMV-179, whereas secretion stimulated by JMV-180 was only inhibited by JMV-179. A model is proposed to reconcile this data, based on the assumption that JMV-180 and CCK-8 interact with discrete sites on the CCKA receptor, which are differentially affected by the binding of antagonists. This model may also explain how a single receptor may transduce multiple signals in response to different agonists.", 
    "2": "We examined the effect of methionine sulfoximine (MSO) and peripheral benzodiazepine (BZD) ligands on ammonia-induced swelling of primary astrocyte cultures. Swelling was completely abolished by co-treatment with MSO, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. We also established that many of the effects caused by ammonia, including the reduction in K+ uptake, increase in Cl- uptake and reduction in myo-inositol uptake were diminished by co-treatment with MSO. Agonists of the peripheral-type BZD receptor aggravated ammonia-induced swelling, whereas a peripheral BZD receptor blocker, PK 11195, diminished the extent of swelling. Our findings implicate glutamine and the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in the pathogenesis of the edema associated with fulminant hepatic failure.", 
    "3": "Many goitrogenic xenobiotics that increase the incidence of thyroid tumors in rodents exert a direct effect on the thyroid gland to disrupt one of several steps in the biosynthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones. This includes 1) inhibition of the iodine-trapping mechanism (thiocyanate or perchlorate), 2) blockage of organic binding of iodine and coupling of iodothyronines to form thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) (e.g., sulfonamides, thiourea, methimazole, and aminotriazole, among others), and 3) inhibition of thyroid hormone secretion by an effect on proteolysis of active hormone from the colloid (lithium or an excess of iodide). Another large group of goitrogenic chemicals disrupts thyroid hormone economy by increasing the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones through an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. This group includes CNS-acting drugs (phenobarbital, benzodiazepines), calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, nifedipine), steroids (spironolactone), retinoids, chlorinated hydrocarbons (chlordane, DDT, TCDD), polyhalogenated biphenyls (PCB, PBB), and enzyme inducers. Thyroid hormone economy also can be disrupted by xenobiotics that inhibit the 5'monodeiodinase, which converts T4 in peripheral sites (e.g., liver and kidney) to biologically active T3. Inhibition of this enzyme by FD&C Red No. 3, amiodarone, and iopanoic acid lowers circulating T3 levels, which results in a compensatory increased secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and an increased incidence of follicular cell tumors in 2-year or lifetime studies in rats. Physiologic perturbations alone such as the feeding of an iodine-deficient diet, partial thyroidectomy, natural goitrogens in certain foods, and transplantation of TSH-secreting pituitary tumors in rodents also can disrupt thyroid hormone economy and, if sustained, increase the development of thyroid tumors in rats. A consistent finding with all of these goitrogens, be they either physiologic perturbations or xenobiotic chemicals, is the chronic hypersecretion of TSH, which by receptor-mediated events places the rodent thyroid gland at greater risk of developing tumors through a secondary mechanism of thyroid oncogenesis.", 
    "4": "The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are structurally diverse compounds that are specific inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT enzyme. The compounds are largely functionally identical and bind to a common site in the enzyme. HIV-1 variants that exhibit reduced susceptibility to these inhibitors have been derived in cell culture and, more recently, from HIV-1-infected patients undergoing experimental therapy. The variants express amino acid substitutions at RT positions that apparently interact directly with the inhibitors. Effects of specific substitutions at these positions vary among the compounds, suggesting subtle differences in how the compounds physically interact with the enzyme.", 
    "5": "The drug sensitivities of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from a group of four untreated and seven TIBO R82913-treated patients were determined in a reverse transcriptase (RT) assay. Five of the treated patients harbored HIV-1 isolates with R82913 sensitivity comparable to that of the isolates of untreated patients, ranging from almost 2-fold higher sensitivity to 13-fold lower sensitivity than that of recombinant p66 RT. From one of the seven treated patients, an HIV-1 strain with a 20-fold reduced sensitivity to R82913 could be isolated; and from another patient, a strain with 100-fold reduced sensitivity (resistance) was isolated. The drug-resistant strain in this patient emerged after 3 weeks of treatment and was due to the Y188L mutation in its RT. On passaging the virus in cord blood lymphocytes, but not in CEM cells, the resistant virus was lost in favor of a different HIV-1 strain harboring the wild-type Y188 with a sensitivity to R82913 comparable to that of wild-type p66 RT. In several HIV-1 isolates (from treated and untreated patients), some HIV-2- and CIVgab-specific amino acids were found. One of these substitutions, that is, I/V179D (from an untreated patient), conferred a sevenfold reduced RT sensitivity to R82913.", 
    "6": "Clinically available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) decrease membrane excitability by interacting with neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels. AEDs developed before 1980 appear to act on sodium (Na) channels, gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors, or calcium (Ca) channels. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates enhance GABAA-receptor-mediated inhibition. Phenytoin, carbamazepine and, possibly, valproate (VPA) decrease high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials by enhancing Na channel inactivation. Ethosuximide and VPA reduce a low threshold (T-type) Ca-channel current. The mechanisms of action of recently developed AEDs are less clear. Lamotrigine may decrease sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of voltage-dependent Na action potentials, and gabapentin (GBP) appears to bind to a specific binding site in the CNS with a restricted regional distribution. However, the identity of the binding site and the mechanism of action of GBP remain uncertain. The antiepileptic effect of felbamate may involve interaction at the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, but the mechanism of action is not yet proven.", 
    "7": "This study describes the antagonistic properties of himbacine, in comparison with those of pirenzepine, at muscarinic receptors mediating the depolarization of rat superior cervical ganglion, the inhibition of electrically-induced twitch contractions of rabbit vas deferens and the contraction of dog saphenous vein, currently classified as putative muscarinic M1 sites. The affinity of himbacine for the vas deferens site (pA2 8.08) was nearly ten times higher than those for the M1 receptors of rat ganglion and dog saphenous vein (pA2 7.14 and 7.16, respectively); affinity estimates for pirenzepine were similar throughout the different preparations. The present data are consistent with the allocation of ganglion and saphenous vein receptors into the M1 subclass; the profile of the vas deferens site, conversely, appears to be different, and possibly more closely related to that reported for the M4/m4 receptor.", 
    "8": "Cloned human AMPA/kainate subunits were functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Cyclothiazide potentiated kainate-evoked currents by 682 +/- 122% (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 5), 1396 +/- 55% (n = 4), and 690 +/- 40% (n = 14) in oocytes expressing GluR1, GluR2, and GluR1 + GluR2 receptors, respectively. AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionate)-induced currents were also potentiated by cyclothiazide. GYKI 52466 (1-(4-amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxyl-5H-2,3-benzod++ + iazepine hydrochloride) attenuated cyclothiazide potentiation in all cases. Thus, modulatory sites for cyclothiazide and GYKI 52466 exist on individual human AMPA/kainate receptor subunits. Additionally, kainate appears to act as a desensitizing partial agonist at human GluR1 and GluR2 receptor subunits.", 
    "9": "We report that kainic acid-induced seizures lead to marked increases in mRNAs encoding basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF and aFGF, respectively) and flg, one of their receptors, in the rat hippocampus. Anticonvulsant pretreatment inhibits the up-regulation of these mRNAs. The observed increase in flg mRNA levels involves the pyramidal cells of all hippocampal subfields and the granular cells of the dentate gyrus. The increased expression of aFGF and bFGF mRNAs is limited to neuron populations that are resistant to seizure-induced injury, the granular cells of dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of CA1 region, respectively. The results suggest that the increase in the FGFs and flg may play pivotal roles in neuron survival and in long-term changes occurring in the hippocampus following seizure activity.", 
    "10": "Inability to remember and amnesia have been shown to be active neurochemical processes. The coupled processes (blockade of the triggering DA stimulating system and activation of the inhibitory GABA-ergic system with the predominant value of postsynaptic D-2 receptors) are a neurochemical basis for development of amnesia. The mechanisms of spontaneous forgetting is provided by a decrease in the activity of the dopaminergic system along with the enhancement of benzodiazepine-GABA-ergic interferentional inhibition. The observed changes in dopamine metabolism, para-tyramine appearance, as well as restructure of D-2 receptors provide the activity of dopamine increasing mechanism which determines the retention of memory traces. A computer model of the spatial interaction of the dopamine membrane-receptor complex was constructed by scanning the samples of synaptic membranes after learning and amnesia. A new method of inducing psychogenic amnesia in human beings has been elaborated. Amnesia is characterized by the absence of increases in the number of cortical connections reflecting the emotional factor of information.", 
    "11": "Examining the actions of L-364,718 on rat pancreatic acini, we found that L-364,718 causes persistent inhibition of cholecystokinin (CCK)-8-stimulated enzyme secretion in acini that were first incubated with L-364,718, washed repeatedly, and then reincubated with CCK-8. This inhibition is maximal after as little as 5 s of first incubation with L-364,718, is unaltered by reducing the temperature of the first incubation from 37 to 4 degrees C and is specific for CCK-8 in that carbachol-stimulated enzyme secretion is unaltered. The inhibitory potency of L-364,718 added to the first incubation followed by washing and reincubation with CCK-8 is nearly the same as when L-364,718 is added together with CCK-8 in the same incubation. The persistent inhibitory action of L-364,718 is not attributable to residual free L-364,718 in the bulk phase of the second incubation medium. In addition, L-364,718 does not cause persistent inhibition by binding irreversibly to CCK receptors because the binding reaction is completely reversible and the persistent inhibition can be surmounted with appropriate concentrations of CCK-8. When acini are first incubated with L-364,718 and washed repeatedly, approximately 0.2% of the original L-364,718 remains trapped in a microenvironment within the acini. This trapping presumably results in a sufficiently high concentration of L-364,718 to produce its persistent, albeit surmountable inhibition.", 
    "12": "Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) can be painful. Pain sensation limits treatment tolerance and consequently also treatment efficacy. Of our population of patients treated with TUMT, 22% (63/288) needed intravenous analgesia and, nevertheless, 6% (17/288) needed definitive treatment interruption. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism of pain sensation during TUMT and to verify whether the prophylactic use of a sedative drug would improve treatment tolerance. Eighty-three patients undergoing TUMT treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia at our department entered a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. Thirty minutes before treatment, 40 patients (group A) received 960 mg cotrimoxazole orally while 43 patients (group B) received 960 mg cotrimoxazole and 10 mg oxazepam, both orally. Statistically significant improvement in treatment tolerance in group B in comparison with group A was found. Pain sensation during TUMT seemed to be mostly due to anxiety. It is concluded that the prophylactic use of a sedative drug is advisable in patients undergoing TUMT in order to improve treatment tolerance.", 
    "13": "In the preceding paper it was found that infusions of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) into the medial septal region, but not several other regions possessing a high density of benzodiazepine receptors, impaired spatial learning, but not cue learning or swim speed, in the Morris water maze. The present investigation sought to further characterize the neuropharmacological profile of this effect. Initially, it was reconfirmed that systemically administered CDP impaired spatial learning, but not cue learning or swim speed, in the water maze. Additionally, it was found that systemically administered scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist, impaired both spatial and cue learning, but not swim speed, confirming the detrimental effects of cholinergic hypofunction on maze learning. In new rats, a dose-response assessment revealed that 60 and 30 nmol, but not 10 nmol, CDP infused into the medial septum impaired spatial learning, but not cue learning or swim speed. On the following day, rats from each dose group, now undrugged, acquired a reversed platform location at control levels, suggesting that the previously observed impairment was not due to a neurotoxic effect. Additionally, it was found that systemically administered flumazenil (10 mg/kg) blocked the spatial learning deficit produced by the 60 nmol dose of CDP infused into the medial septum. However, intraseptal infusions of flumazenil (10, 20, or 30 nmol) failed to attenuate the spatial learning deficit produced by systemically administered CDP. Finally, systemically administered tetrahydroaminoacridine (1 or 3 mg/kg), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, failed to attenuate the spatial learning deficit produced by intraseptal CDP (60 nmol). Together these results implicate benzodiazepine receptors in the medial septum in the amnesic actions of CDP but suggest that additional sites also mediate this action. The present results fail to support the idea that the spatial learning deficit produced by intraseptal infusions of CDP is due to a suppression of septo-hippocampal cholinergic activity and it is proposed that CDP impairs spatial learning by exacerbating hippocampal inhibition by inhibiting septo-hippocampal GABAergic projection neurons.", 
    "14": "This experiment compares the effects of microinjections into the basolateral amygdala nucleus of diazepam (DZP) and a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, BRL 46470A, on acquisition and retention of an inhibitory avoidance tasks by rats. The animals were microinjected with DZP or BRL 46470A between 10 and 15 min before the learning trial. Retention testing 48 h later showed impaired retention in animals injected with DZP but not with BRL 46470A. These results show that BRL 46470A, a compound suggested to have anxiolytic effects does not induce amnesia. This evidence for a possible dissociation between anxiety-reducing and memory-disrupting effects of a drug has implications, for one, for the understanding of the neuronal substrates mediating these effects, and secondly, for the search for anxiolytic agents devoid of undesirable side effects on memory processes.", 
    "15": "Experimental lesions and quantitative autoradiography were used to investigate the cellular localisation of receptors. Lesions were produced by intrastriatal injections of either volkensin or ricin, only the former is retrogradely transported. Volkensin treatment caused significant losses in Fr1/Fr2 of neocortex in the number of infragranular pyramidal neurones and binding to deep cortical layers of both [3H]pirenzepine (muscarinic cholinergic m1 receptors) and [3H]kainate (kainate sensitive glutamate receptors). In common with previous findings, which also showed sparing of interneurones, supragranular pyramidal neurones were not reduced in number and the binding to deep cortical layers of [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(n-dipropylamino)tetralin (serotonin 1A receptors) was reduced. Significant increases in [3H]prazosin binding to both total alpha adrenoceptors and the alpha 1b subtype were observed in superficial layers. Adrenoceptors were not decreased in any layer. The binding of [3H] GABA to GABAA receptors was not affected at all. Muscarinic receptors and pyramidal neurones were also reduced in deep cortical layers of Par1/Par2 in common with serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors and total alpha receptors were significantly decreased in the middle layers. Overall m1 and kainate receptors were less affected than 5-HT1A receptors. The results are discussed in terms of the biology of cortical pyramidal neurones, drugs for Alzheimer's disease and novel ligands for improving human brain in vivo scanning techniques.", 
    "16": "The present investigation sought to determine the neuroanatomical locus through which the amnesic and anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepine agonist chlordiazepoxide are mediated. Rats were infused with either chlordiazepoxide (60 nmol/microliters) or artificial CSF (1 microliter) into either the frontal cortex, nucleus basalis magnocellularis/substantia innominata, amygdala, medial septum, hippocampus, or cerebellum and run in the open field to assess anxiety as thigmotaxia and in the Morris water maze to assess spatial learning. Other rats were given chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) or saline (1 ml/kg) systemically and run in the open field and water maze. When chlordiazepoxide was administered systemically, rats showed significantly less thigmotaxia, but not overall activity, than controls in the open field, and were deficit in spatial learning, but not cue learning or swim speed, in the water maze. Intracranial infusions revealed a neuroanatomical specificity for the amnesic and anxiolytic actions of chlordiazepoxide. Infusions of chlordiazepoxide into the amygdala, but none of the other structures, reduced thigmotaxia without affecting overall activity levels whereas infusions into the medial septum, but none of the other structures, prevented spatial learning, but not cue learning, and reduced swim speed in the water maze. Together, these finding suggest that the medial septum and the amygdala mediate the amnesic and anxiolytic actions of chlordiazepoxide, respectively. Moreover, these results provide direct evidence that the amnesic and anxiolytic actions of chlordiazepoxide are independent.", 
    "17": "A series of 3-(arylureido)-5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepines, nonpeptidal antagonists of the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), are described. Derived by reasoned modification of the CCK-A selective 3-carboxamido-1,4-benzodiazepine, MK-329, this paper chronicles the development of potent, orally effective compounds in which selectivity for the CCK-B receptor subtype was achieved. The principal lead structure that emerged from these studied is L-365,260, a compound which has been submitted for clinical evaluation. Details of the ability to modulate the receptor interactions of these benzodiazepines by appropriate structure modifications are discussed which imply the possibility of further refining the CCK-B receptor affinity and selectivity of this class of compounds.", 
    "18": "Recent studies have shown that light-induced phase shifts of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity are associated with c-fos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) of the lateral geniculate nucleus of rodents. In order to determine whether c-fos expression is necessary for the phase shifting effects of a non-photic stimulus, we assessed Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-lir) in the SCN and IGL at various times after an injection of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, at circadian time (CT) 6; i.e. at a time when triazolam induces an acute increase in locomotor activity and maximal phase advances in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity. Specific Fos-lir staining was not observed in the SCN or IGL regions of any animals treated with triazolam or vehicle at any time point examined. These results indicate that exposure to an activity-inducing stimulus at circadian times when this stimulus induces phase shifts does not induce Fos protein synthesis in the SCN or IGL regions.", 
    "19": "The effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of melatonin and/or beta-endorphin on the [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the cerebral cortex of pinealectomized or superior cervical ganglionectomized rats was studied. Pinealectomy decreased the maximum concentration of benzodiazepine receptors (Bmax) without affecting the dissociation constant (KD), while melatonin, ineffective in control animals, counteracted the effect of pinealectomy. Intracerebroventricular injection of beta-endorphin increases Bmax in both control and pinealectomized animals, the effect being significantly higher in the latter. Simultaneous i.c.v. injection of melatonin + beta-endorphin did not further increase Bmax in any group, whereas i.c.v. injection of naloxone significantly blocked the effects of melatonin and/or beta-endorphin administration. Pineal sympathetic denervation produced a significant increase in Bmax and KD, whereas i.c.v. injection of melatonin further increased the former, restoring KD to control values. Neither i.c.v. administration of beta-endorphin or melatonin + beta-endorphin significantly modified the ganglionectomy-dependent increase in Bmax, although both treatments restored KD to control values. Naloxone administration had no effect on beta-endorphin- and melatonin + beta-endorphin-treated ganglionectomized groups, but counteracted the increased effect of melatonin on Bmax in ganglionectomized animals.", 
    "20": "The quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique has been employed to identify the neural circuits involved in diazepam withdrawal. Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was assessed in parallel groups of rats chronically treated with diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p., daily for 28 days), in rats that were withdrawn from chronic diazepam 24 h previously and in those that received flumazenil (5 mg/kg i.v.) immediately or 24 h after the last dose of diazepam. Two further groups received chronic vehicle or acute flumazenil (5 mg/kg i.v.). Rats withdrawn from diazepam 24 h previously did not produce changes in LCGU in the 51 structures examined compared with both control and chronic diazepam treated groups, suggesting that spontaneous withdrawal from small doses of diazepam does not evoke marked alterations in functional activity. In contrast, flumazenil-precipitated diazepam withdrawal produced a marked increase in glucose use in structures of the Papez circuit of emotion (mammillary body, anterior thalamus, cingulate cortex), together with increases in the septal nucleus, basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Less widespread increases in glucose use occurred in primary auditory and visual areas and in extrapyramidal areas. This pattern resembles that produced after acute FG-7142 administration (Brain Res., 475 (1988) 218-231). In rats receiving flumazenil 24 h after the last dose of diazepam there was a similar, but more restricted, pattern of change in LCGU. Flumazenil had no effect on LCGU in drug naive rats. Thus, flumazenil could only exert an effect upon LCGU in rats chronically treated with diazepam. These data provide functional neuroanatomical evidence for a withdrawal shift in the inverse agonist direction after chronic diazepam and suggest that flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal changes may merely be a reflection of this phenomenon.", 
    "21": "Recent evidence suggests that anxiety and its biological concomitants may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression. In the present study, the in vitro radioligand binding of [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]muscimol and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) sites on the benzodiazepine/GABA chloride ionophore receptor complex (BGRC) was examined using the learned helplessness paradigm. Only rats which did not develop the syndrome showed a significant increase in [3H]muscimol binding in cerebral cortex and a decrease in [35S]TBPS binding in cerebral cortex and hippocampus in comparison to naive controls. For both ligands, this represented a change in Bmax rather than a change in affinity. Adrenalectomy had no impact on these alterations indicating that critical endogenous factors are not manufactured by the adrenal glands. These findings suggest that the BGRC in the forebrain may be a site mediating the 'coping' ability of rats that do not develop the learned helplessness syndrome. The possible involvement of neurosteroids in this effect is discussed.", 
    "22": "A rapid twin-column gas chromatographic (GC) method for simultaneous screening and determination of commonly prescribed benzodiazepines and other new anxiolytics from plasma is described. Identical fused-silica Ultra 2 (5% phenyl methyl silicone) columns were connected to nitrogen-phosphorus and electron-capture detectors. The drugs were isolated from 1 ml of plasma by solid-phase extraction (SPE) onto a C8 reversed-phase sorbent and recovered with 0.5% acetic acid in methanol. The eluate was reconstituted with isopropanol which was found suitable for on-column injection. Prazepam was used as internal standard. The method was found appropriate for the quantification in a single run of alpidem, alprazolam, buspirone, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, clotiazepam, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam, tofisopam, triazolam, and zolpidem within 30 min. Limits of quantification allow toxicological or pharmacological determinations, except for buspirone: only toxic blood levels can be quantified by this method. This first SPE of imidazopyridines (alpidem and zolpidem) provides faster, more efficient and cheaper sample preparation than the traditional liquid-liquid procedure. This GC analysis of alpidem and zolpidem is also the first described procedure for simultaneous quantification of all different classes of anxiolytics.", 
    "23": "[3H] gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) release was studied in rat brain slices in the absence or presence of cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8). [3H]GABA release under the conditions used was Ca(2+)-dependent and insensitive to the presence of the glial uptake blocker beta-alanine. While the basal release of [3H]GABA was not affected by CCK-8, the K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]GABA was significantly enhanced by 300 nM of CCK-8 in the caudate putamen, the substantia nigra, the hippocampal formation and the parietofrontal cortex. In the cerebral cortex the CCK-8 enhancement of [3H]GABA release was concentration-dependent and abolished by the CCKB receptor antagonists PD135,158 (1.0 nM) and L-365,260 (100 nM). A significant counteraction of the CCK-8 action was also found with the CCKA receptor antagonist L-364,718 (100 nM) but only in concentrations at which both CCKA and CCKB receptors are blocked. No CCK-8 effects on [3H]GABA release were observed when tetrodotoxin was superfused 5 min before the K(+)-induced [3H]GABA release. It is suggested that the enhancing actions of CCK-8 on K(+)-stimulated [3H]GABA release is mainly related to an activation of CCKB receptors.", 
    "24": "Cholinomimetic agents increase blood pressure and heart rate via central muscarinic cholinoceptors in various species. It was reported that i.c.v. injection of the muscarinic M1 and M3 cholinoceptor selective antagonist, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide), inhibited the pressor response to physostigmine, while the M1 selective antagonist, pirenzepine, was ineffective. In the present study, the involvement of muscarinic M2 cholinoceptors in central cholinergic hypertension and tachycardia was investigated. Physostigmine (10-80 micrograms/kg i.v.), a cholinesterase inhibitor, and oxotremorine (20-40 micrograms/kg i.v.), a direct muscarinic cholinoceptor agonist, caused a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure. Additionally, physostigmine induced dose-dependent tachycardiac responses. I.c.v. administration of the muscarinic M2 cholinoceptor antagonists, AF-DX 116 and methoctramine, inhibited both physostigmine (60 micrograms/kg) and oxotremorine (20 micrograms/kg)-induced pressor responses at their lower doses used in this study (100 nmol/rat and 10 nmol/rat, respectively). These findings indicate the partial involvement of postsynaptic muscarinic M2 cholinoceptors. The higher doses of the antagonists (AF-DX 116,300 nmol/rat and methoctramine 30 nmol/rat) potentiated the blood pressure increase due to physostigmine but did not affect that due to oxotremorine. The physostigmine-induced tachycardiac responses were influenced similarly by these antagonists. These results suggest the presence and tonic influence of presynaptic inhibitory muscarinic M2 cholinoceptors.", 
    "25": "It is well known that systemically administered benzodiazepines (BZDs) induce anterograde amnesia in a variety of learning tasks. BZs effects are mediated through the GABAA complex by enhancing GABA-induced synaptic inhibition. As the GABAergic system in the amygdaloid complex (AC) is a site of action for the anxiolytic effects of BZs, such findings suggest that BZs may also influence memory through the amygdala. The present report summarizes a recent series of experiments designed to examine this implication. In a first experiment rats received either sham or bilateral AC lesion using N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). One week later, animals were trained on an inhibitory avoidance task and tested 48 h later. Diazepam (DZP; 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was injected 30 min prior to acquisition. The results demonstrate that DZP-induced retention deficits was blocked in rats with AC lesions. In a second experiment, in an attempt to localize the site of BZDs amnestic action in the AC, we tested the effects of DZP in rats with bilateral ibotenic acid-induced lesions of central (CE), lateral (LAT) or basolateral (BL) amygdala nuclei. The results shown that retention was impaired in animals with CE and LAT lesions but not in animals with BL lesions. In a third experiment we tested the effects of DZP microinjections in different nuclei of the AC on retention performance of rats trained in an avoidance task. The results demonstrate that DZP microinjection prior training in the BL/LAT, but not CE nuclei produce anterograde amnesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The inferior colliculus (IC) is a well known relay station for auditory pathways in the brainstem. In the present review we are suggesting that aversive states are also generated and elaborated in the inferior colliculus and that this structure may be part of a brain system commanding defensive behavior. The evidences presented in this review have been obtained from experiments carried out with the combined use of intracerebral microinjections and of electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus. This electrical stimulation caused a behavioral activation together with autonomic reactions usually observed as part of the defense reaction. NMDA--an excitatory amino acid--, or bicuculline--a GABAA antagonist--injected into the IC mimicked the effects of its electrical stimulation. The IC electrical stimulation showed clear aversive properties as rats submitted to a switch-off paradigm quickly learned to interrupt it. Systemic administration as well as IC microinjections of the anxiolytic compound midazolam caused dose-dependent increases in the latency and reductions in the frequency of switch-off responses to the inferior colliculus electrical stimulation. Similar results were obtained following microinjections into this brainstem structure of the GABAA agonist muscimol. These results suggest that neural substrates responsible for defensive behavior in the inferior colliculus may be depressed by benzodiazepines as part of the anxiolytic action of these compounds. This anti-aversive action may be produced by the enhancement of GABAA mechanisms. Serotonergic mechanisms seem also to be involved in the modulation of these aversive states as IC microinjections of zimelidine, a 5-HT uptake blocker, caused a significant inhibition of the switch-off responses in the shuttle-box.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "In naive rats benzodiazepines have clear anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus-maze, but in rats with previous plus-maze experience benzodiazepines are ineffective. This phenomenon does not depend on the drug state on trial 1 or on the inter-trial interval and generalises across mazes of different material; it is dependent on experience of the open arm. The phenomenon of \"one-trial tolerance\" to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines is not seen in other animal tests; and there is no equivalent phenomenon of \"one-trial withdrawal\" or of tolerance to anxiogenic effects in the plus-maze. The phenomenon is not seen in unhandled rats, in rats given longer trials in the plus-maze, or in those given an amnesic treatment on trial 1. It is suggested that during the first 5 min in the elevated plus-maze the rats are acquiring a fear of heights and it is this phobic anxiety state that is measured during the second 5-min trial. Thus the nature of the anxiety generated by the maze is different on trials 1 and 2. The results of a factor analysis study confirm this conclusion.", 
    "28": "The amygdala (AM) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) represent the rostral and the caudal pole, respectively, of a longitudinally organized neural system, that is responsible for the integration of behavioral and physiological manifestations of defensive reactions against innate and learned threats. Microinjection of benzodiazepine (BZD) anxiolytics, GABAA receptor agonists or 5-HT receptor antagonists into the AM has anxiolytic effects in conflict tests and other models of conditioned fear, while similar administration of 5-HT or of a 5-HT1A receptor agonist has anxiogenic effects. On the other hand, in the test of electrical stimulation of the PAG, microinjection of 5-HT, 5-HT mimetics, or of drugs that enhance the action of endogenous 5-HT into the same brain area has an antiaversive effect, like BZD and GABAA agonists. Furthermore, microinjection of midazolam, of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-7, or of the 5-HT1A/1B receptor blocker propranolol increased the exploration of the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, having therefore an anxiolytic effect. These results point to an inhibitory role of the GABA-BZD system in both the AM and the PAG. In contrast, 5-HT seemingly enhances conditioned fear in the AM, while inhibiting unconditioned fear in the PAG. Thus, 5-HT2/1C antagonists reportedly release punished behavior when injected into the AM, whereas they antagonized the antiaversive effect of 5-HT, zimelidine and 5-HT1A/1B receptor blockers in the PAG. Since reported clinical studies revealed that one of such compounds, ritanserin, relieves generalized anxiety but tends to aggravate panic disorder, a relationship may be established between the AM and anxiety and the PAG and panic.", 
    "29": "Great progress has been made in the last five years in demonstrating the presence of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in mammalian tissues, in beginning studies on the origin of these natural compounds and in elucidating their possible biological roles. Many unanswered questions remain regarding the sources and the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the presence of BZDs in brain and their different physiological and/or biochemical actions. This essay will focus on recent findings supporting that: (1) BZDs are of natural origin; (2) mammalian brain contains BZDs in concentrations ranging between 5.10(-10) to 10(-8) M; (3) BZDs and BZD-like molecules are unevenly distributed in brain; the highest concentration is found in limbic structures (4) dietary source of BZDs might be a plausible explanation for their occurrence in animal tissues, including man; (5) the formation of BZDs-like molecules in brain is a possibility, experimentally supported; (6) BZDs like molecules including diazepam and N desmethyldiazepam are elevated in hepatic encephalopathy; (7) natural BZDs in the brain are involved in the modulation of memory processes. Future studies using the full range of biochemical, physiological, behavioral and molecular biological techniques available to the neuroscientist will hopefully continue to yield new and exciting information concerning the biological roles that BZDs might play in the normal and pathological functioning of the brain.", 
    "30": "Experiments using localized infusions into selected brain structures of agonists and antagonists of various synaptic receptors, given before or after behavioral training, have led to the following conclusions: (1) Memory is processed shortly after training in the amygdala, medial septum and hippocampus by glutamatergic NMDA and AMPA receptors activated in that sequence. Cholinergic muscarinic receptors are activated concurrently with the former. GABAA receptors modulated by brain benzodiazepines and by beta-noradrenergic receptors inhibit the process. (2) The sequential involvement of NMDA and AMPA receptors suggests that long-term potentiation (LTP) of the synapses activated by the learning experiences in the hippocampus and/or amygdala and medial septum is the crucial event. Expression of this LTP at the time of testing is necessary for retrieval: AMPA receptor blockade in the hippocampus and amygdala at the time of testing hinders retrieval. This suggests that the LTP underlies the memory process itself. (3) The amygdala, medial septum and hippocampus mediate different types of memory and/or different components of memories. The entorhinal cortex, through mechanisms that require intact NMDA receptors and are inhibited by GABAA receptors, intervenes in post-training memory processing 90-180 min after the other limbic regions. The entorhinal cortex integrates consecutively acquired memories; this role could be maintained by the LTP that is generated after training in the amygdala, hippocampus and medial septum. Post-training intervention of the entorhinal cortex does not occur if this region is inhibited at the time of training.", 
    "31": "Defensive behaviors comprise a set of flexible and adaptive responses to threatening situations and stimuli. In semi-natural situations affording a wide variety of responses, defensive behaviors change over time in response to information about the presence of danger, acquired through risk assessment activities. Two test batteries, a Fear/Defense Test Battery (F/DTB) measuring defensive behaviors to present, approaching predators, and an Anxiety/Defense Test Battery (A/DTB) measuring reactions to potential threat, have been used in conjunction with administration of potentially anxiolytic drugs. Results suggest that the F/DTB behaviors are not systematically responsive to anxiolytics. However, on the A/DTB, anxiolytic benzodiazepines produce a profile of effects primarily involving risk assessment activities. Very similar profiles of effect are seen also with some 5-HT1A compounds, alcohol, imipramine and MK-801, but not for a variety of additional compounds. A consistent pattern of gender differences are obtained with the A/DTB, with females more defensive than males. These results indicate that particular patterns of defensive behaviors may provide a very appropriate animal model for the analysis of pharmacological effects on anxiety.",

To evaluate the effect of benzodiazepines on CRH-induced immune suppression, potent centrally acting benzodiazepines were administered prior to central infusion of CRH (i.c.v.; 1.0 microgram). CRH induced a significant (P < 0.01) reduction of splenic natural killer cell activity which was completely antagonized by pretreatment with either diazepam or alprazolam.", 
    "33": "The effects of n-octanol on GABA-induced currents were examined on the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s and alpha 1 beta 2 combinations of GABAA receptor subunits expressed in a human kidney cell line (HEK 293), using the whole-cell variation of the patch clamp technique. The EC50 of the GABA dose-response curve for the alpha 1 beta 2 combination was lower than that for the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s combination. n-Octanol at 100 microM augmented the GABA-induced currents in a dose-dependent manner, decreasing the EC50 of the GABA dose-response curve without affecting the maximal response. The magnitude of n-octanol potentiation was nearly the same in both combinations. In contrast, a benzodiazepine agonist, chlordiazepoxide, augmented the currents of the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s combination only. We conclude that the potentiation of GABAA receptor-mediated currents by a long carbon chain n-alcohol does not require the gamma 2 subunit.",

Cimetidine (400-1000 mg/kg, i.p.) induced dose-dependent tonic convulsion. Muscimol, AOAA and DABA effectively protected mice against cimetidine-induced seizures. Bicuculline and picrotoxin significantly potentiated the seizures induced by cimetidine and effectively antagonized the protective effects of muscimol, AOAA and DABA against the seizures. Diazepam and phenobarbitone significantly protected the mice against cimetidine-induced seizures while phenytoin and strychnine did not significantly alter the seizures.

The i.c.v. injection of ACTH1-10 (10-20 ng) or beta-endorphin (10-20 ng) significantly increased [3H]FNZ binding to a similar extent. The effect of i.c.v. injection of ACTH1-10 on brain binding was blunted by simultaneous beta-endorphin administration at the same doses. The i.c.v. naloxone injection (10-20 ng) did not modify the effect of ACTH1-10 (10 ng) on [3H]FNZ binding, but counteracted, in a dose-related manner, the blocking effect of beta-endorphin on ACTH1-10-dependent brain [3H]FNZ binding.

However, while the binding affinity of Ro5-4864 varies enormously across species, PK11195 always displays high affinity, suggesting that their binding domains are overlapping but not identical. We report here that recombinant human and bovine PBR produced in yeast, a microorganism devoid of endogenous PBR, can be labelled with [3H]PK11195, but only the human receptor can be labelled with [3H]Ro5-4864. Furthermore, we identified, through the binding analysis of human-bovine chimaeric receptors, a region near the C-terminal end of the PBR, with only five non-conserved amino acids between human and bovine sequences, as responsible for the difference in high affinity binding of Ro5-4864 to the two receptors.",

Our results demonstrate that the GABAA antagonist bicuculline and the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam, both of which prevent light-induced phase shifts, do not inhibit photic induction of Fos expression in the hamster SCN. In contrast, the GABAB agonist, baclofen, prevents both light-induced phase shifts and inhibits photic induction of Fos expression in the SCN. One explanation of this difference may be that baclofen acts to prevent photic information from reaching the SCN while bicuculline and diazepam act within the SCN at a point 'downstream' from Fos induction.",

The hyperpolarization by CCK was markedly reduced or blocked by the CCKB-antagonist L-365,260 whereas addition of the Bom-antagonist [D-Phe12,Leu14]-Bom antagonized the effects of Bom, suggesting a specific action of these peptides. When CCK and Bom were tested on the same cell, both peptides were effective, indicating a colocalization of receptors for CCK and Bom on the glial membrane.

Microdialysis probes were implanted, under anesthesia, in the left and the right striatum of the normal rats and in the normal and denervated striatum of the nigral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. Dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined by liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. The different drugs were infused through the dialysis probe during 40 min. Pirenzepine (5 microM), a selective M1 antagonist, produced a significant decrease in DA release in the normal and the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, with no significant difference between both groups. Methoctramine, a selective M2 antagonist, produced a dose-dependent increase in DA release between 20 and 200 microM in the normal rats, with no significant effect on DOPAC and HVA. Infusing 75 microM methoctramine produced a significant increase in DA release with a more pronounced effect in the intact animals compared to the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals. The non-selective agonist carbachol produced a decrease in dopamine release after infusion of 50 microM (M2 effect) and an increase in dopamine release after infusion of 50 mM (M1 effect) in the normal rats. Infusing 50 microM carbachol in the denervated striatum, produced a slight increase in DA release. Our data suggest that presynaptic M1-muscarinic receptors enhance and M2-muscarinic receptors inhibit DA release in the striatum of the rat; and that 3 weeks after 6-hydroxydopamine lesioning there may be a normalisation of the number of M1-receptors with a loss of M2-receptors at the denervated side.", 
    "43": "The transition from mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing in the intensive care unit is a two-stage process: weaning and extubation. Certain parameters require consideration before the commencement of weaning, namely respiratory function (both pulmonary gas exchange and respiratory muscle strength), cardiovascular status, stability of clinical condition, low metabolic demands, psychological factors and, possibly, patient collaboration. Appropriate sedation is crucial for successful weaning to keep the patient rested and to maintain the oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production low. In this review, three types of patient are considered: patients having short-term ventilation after trauma or surgery, those having long-term ventilation for chronic pulmonary disease, and those with other associated severe organ dysfunction, such as heart failure. Strategies for weaning are outlined for each of these situations and the role of sedation is discussed. Making the transition from mechanical ventilation to unassisted spontaneous breathing can be a difficult process, particularly for those patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring prolonged ventilatory assistance for severe respiratory failure secondary to: exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) underlying diseases affecting cardiac function. This transition may be considered to comprise two separate stages, namely weaning and extubation. Weaning consists of preparation for spontaneous breathing supported and monitored by a mechanical ventilator and attendant monitoring of all the important vital parameters, while extubation marks the final switch to unsupported spontaneous breathing, which may be quite a big step for the patient. Important weaning parameters.", 
    "44": "Sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) aims to improve patient comfort and facilitate treatment procedures. Most units still rely on a combination of opioid and benzodiazepines with the addition of other drugs for specific requirements. However, the effect of sedative agents in critically ill patients is often unpredictable, so frequent assessment of the depth of sedation is essential to match the depth to patient requirements. In the 1990s, heavy sedation and paralysis is not considered appropriate for many ICU patients; a minimum sedation approach limits cardiovascular or respiratory depression and enables earlier weaning and extubation of patients. Administering sedative agents by continuous infusion is convenient but, unless the level of sedation is reassessed regularly, many patients may become over-sedated. The use of propofol for short-term sedation in ICUs has allowed the maintenance of sedation to continue until just a few hours before extubation but the benefits of propofol for longer-term indications are more debatable. Closer titration of dose and desired effects could also be achieved by a patient-controlled system. The technique may not be suitable for a large number of patients, particularly early in their ICU stay but, for long-term sedation and in the weaning phase--of sedation as well as ventilation--the utility of a drug delivery system truly controlled by the patient should be further explored. The ICU has been succinctly described as an environment in which 'anxiety is prevalent, pain frequent, rest difficult and sleep impossible'. Sedation in the ICU has the double objective of relieving patient distress as well as facilitating treatment procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Sedative drugs are widely used in intensive care, primarily in ventilated patients. The common actions and side-effects of these agents are widely recognised. However, recent evidence suggests that opiates and other sedative agents that are used in this situation also have important, but not widely appreciated, effects on metabolism, physiological signalling and disease mechanisms. Some of these effects are an extension of their expected therapeutic actions; these are being elucidated as the biological consequences of stress, and its suppression is now being clarified. An example is the central effects of benzodiazepines and opioids on metabolism and immune function. In other instances these drugs have important peripheral actions, with immunomodulatory or metabolic roles. Furthermore, some drugs may modify disease processes--an example being the antioxidant effect of propofol. Finally, basic cellular mechanisms, such as immediate early gene expression and transcription factor activation, may involve processes that may be susceptible to modification by sedative agents. Such secondary effects of sedative agents need to be investigated for three reasons. First, they provide explanations for some phenomena observed during their use. Second, some of the undesirable side-effects may be avoided by judicious use of drugs in certain clinical situations. Finally, there is the prospect that we may be able to harness some actions for novel therapeutic purposes.", 
    "46": "A randomised crossover study was undertaken to compare the quality and cost of controlled versus empirical sedation with midazolam in critically ill patients. Patients (n = 40) entering the ICU were enrolled provided they satisfied the strict entry criteria. During 90 hours of midazolam sedation, patients received randomly allocated 10-hour periods of controlled or empirical sedation. With empirical sedation, the mean dose of midazolam and the cost of sedation were almost double those with controlled sedation. The quality of sedation was superior with the controlled method. In a separate study on 352 patients, a cost-benefit analysis of controlled sedation with midazolam or propofol infusion or bolus injections of morphine plus diazepam showed that the quality of sedation achieved with propofol was superior to the other two regimens and that, with morphine plus diazepam, the quality of sedation was unacceptably poor. Although the direct purchase price of propofol was higher than that of other agents, the total cost of sedation with propofol was lower than that for midazolam for short-term intensive care (less than 24 hours) and comparable to midazolam for longer-term use. However, indirect benefits of sedation with propofol include a much shorter ICU stay with the attendant reduced nursing costs and greater throughout the patients, and this more than compensates for the higher purchase price of the agent.",

TEN was instituted immediately after surgery via gastrostomy and/or jejunostomy tube inserted during laparotomy or via an endoscope and was continued for the whole stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Dramatic reductions in both mortality (24.4% vs 35.1% in the controls; p = 0.025) and the incidence of sepsis (8.9% vs 23.8% in the controls; p = 0.025) were found when early enteral feeding was given. The absence of pressure sores and gastro-intestinal bleeding (for example, stress ulcus), which had previously been a common occurrence in this intensive care unit, was remarkable with the introduction of TEN and propofol sedation.

    "49": "The muscarinic receptor subtype mediating contraction of the guinea pig lung strip preparation was investigated and compared with that in guinea pig tracheal and human peripheral airway (small bronchi) smooth muscle preparations, using a number of subtype selective muscarinic receptor antagonists. It was found that guinea pig lung strip contraction was not mediated by a homogeneous class of muscarinic M3 receptors, in contrast to guinea pig tracheal and human peripheral airway smooth muscle. The affinities of the M1- and M3/M2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists on the guinea pig lung strip were between 0.35 and 1.94 log units lower than in the M3 receptor tissues (respective pA2 values on guinea pig lung strip and trachea: pirenzepine 6.36/6.71, AF-DX 474 6.39/7.11, AQ-RA 721 6.93/7.96, DAU 5884 6.78/8.72, UH-AH 371 7.04/8.20), whereas the affinities of the M2/M3-selective antagonists were between 0.63 and 1.97 log units higher (AF-DX 116 6.63/6.00, AQ-RA 741 7.48/6.63, gallamine 5.44/3.47, methoctramine 7.30/5.38). As a result, a good correlation was obtained when pA2 values from guinea pig lung strip were compared to pKi values towards bovine cardiac muscarinic M2 receptors, though it was noticed that pirenzepine and the M3/M2-selective antagonists showed a closer relationship than the M2-selective compounds. These results suggest that cholinergic contraction of the guinea pig lung strip is mediated by muscarinic M2-like receptors, possibly representing a novel subtype or a mixture of M2 (cardiac) and M3 (or M4) subtypes. It remains to be established, however, on what structure in the lung these contractile M2-like receptors are located and also by which transduction mechanism they produce contraction.",

    "51": "The changes in extracellular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, the modifications in binding capacities of GABA-receptor subtypes A and B and of the Cl- ionophore sites localized in the ionic-channel associated to the GABAA receptors were studied in hippocampus of rats subjected to a convulsive dose of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor soman. Whereas extracellular GABA levels, just as binding on GABAA and GABAB receptors, were not modified under soman, a significant transient decrease in the binding capacities of the Cl- ionophore site of the GABAA receptor complex occurred within the first 10 min of seizures in CA1, CA3 areas, and in the dentate gyrus with return to basal values after 30 min. Accordingly, a transient decrease of the brain muscimol-gated Cl- influx was observed after 10 min of seizures. An increased ability of diazepam to potentiate the GABAA gated Cl- influx occurred at the same time. Altogether, these data demonstrated that an impairment of the GABAA receptor function occurs at the beginning of seizures. This suggests that a temporary decrease of GABAAergic function may contribute to the onset of seizures.", 
    "52": "1 A recent audit of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy carried out by the Royal College of Surgeons of England has shown that the majority of endoscopists use a bolus injection rather than a slow intravenous titration of benzodiazepine for intravenous sedation. In this study we have confirmed the theoretical premise that a reduced dose of midazolam is required when given as a bolus. A mean dose of 4.65 mg midazolam intravenously has been found to be effective and safe in sedating patients under 70 years (n = 552). The dose of midazolam needed is reduced in older patients: patients over 70 years (n = 236) needed a mean dose of 1.89 mg. 2 Topical pharyngeal anaesthesia was not required with these doses of midazolam, and it was our impression that the examination was equally well tolerated with a similar degree of anterograde amnesia as in the previous study. 3 Our data, together with the results of the audit, would suggest many endoscopists are employing unnecessarily large and at times potentially dangerous doses of intravenous sedation in elderly patients and that the vast majority of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies can be performed successfully, without topical pharyngeal anaesthesia, using a bolus injection techniquewith a reduced dosage of sedative agent.", 
    "53": "When given the opportunity to choose between a novel and a familiar compartment (free-exploratory paradigm), BALB/c mice exhibited a preference for familiar places and a marked number of attempts at entry into the novel compartment followed by avoidance responses. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice showed a preference for novel places and very few avoidance responses towards novelty. When novelty was reduced by two familiar odours, fresh sawdust or urine of conspecifics, the neophobia of the BALB/c mice was reversed and the animals clearly showed a preference for the novel compartment. This experimental paradigm can be proposed as an effective animal model for investigating drugs potentially able to reduce neophobia in BALB/c mice. The effects of anxiolytics, effective in the usual animal models of \"state\" anxiety, were investigated in the free-exploratory paradigm which may model another type of anxiety, termed by Lister (1990) \"trait\" anxiety. Thus, the behavioural effects of two benzodiazepine full agonists, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, two non-benzodiazepine partial agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, Ro 19-8022 and alpidem, the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, and the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, zacopride, were assessed in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and Ro 19-8022 completely reversed the preference of BALB/c mice for the familiar compartment, treated animals exhibiting a significant preference for novel places. In contrast, alpidem, 8-OH-DPAT and zacopride did not significantly modify their behaviour. Moreover, the same drugs did not modify the specific responses of C57BL/6 mice toward novelty. These results demonstrate that drugs which bind in a non-selective manner to heterogeneous benzodiazepine recognition sites were very effective in reducing neophobia in BALB/c mice, whereas 5-HT-interacting drugs were unable to counteract their neophobic behaviour. Thus, the free-exploratory paradigm can be proposed as an effective method for testing potential neophobia-(\"trait\" anxiety) reducing drugs.", 
    "54": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (2.5-15.0mg/kg), a full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, and bretazenil (5.0-30.0mg/kg), a partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist, were examined in the murine elevated plus-maze paradigm. Behaviours recorded comprised the traditional indices of anxiety as well as a number of ethologically derived measures. Results show that chlordiazepoxide (10-15mg/kg) and bretazenil (5-30mg/kg) not only decreased traditional indices of anxiety but also reduced risk assessment behaviours such as head-dipping and stretch attend postures from secure areas of the maze. Both compounds produced these effects without adversely affecting general activity levels. While traditional indices of anxiety did not clearly discriminate between the two compounds, some differences were apparent on the ethological measures. The dose-response curves for bretazenil were generally shallower than those for chlordiazepoxide, confirming its partial agonist profile. Together, these data support the view that benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists may have utility in the management of human anxiety disorders.",

The design was that of a case-control study involving 380 fallers seeking medical treatment and 342 unmatched controls selected randomly from the population register. The occurrence of a fall was shown by logistic regression analysis to be related to advanced age, presence of benzodiazepine in the serum, hypertrophy of the prostate, poor mental capacity, presence of chronic lung disease and asthma, use of analgesics and use of digitalis in the men, and to advanced age, poor mental capacity, presence of benzodiazepine in the serum, use of analgesics and non-occurrence of lower limb arthrosis in the women. The corresponding log-linear models showed advanced age and the presence of benzodiazepine in the serum to be independent risk factors for falling both in the men and women. Furthermore, the use of analgesics was related to falling in the women with normal mental capacities. No disease was independently associated with falls. The results suggest caution in the use of benzodiazepines among the elderly.",

The results show that naloxone, the opiate antagonist, potentiated clonazepam-induced hyperglycaemia.

Moreover, there are behavioral data consistent with the anxiolytic actions of GABA-receptor positive steroids.

In a separate experiment, no such effect could be found for young mice. alpha-LA alleviated age-related NMDA receptor deficits (Bmax) without changing muscarinic, benzodiazepine, and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor deficits in aged mice. The carbachol-stimulated accumulation of inositol monophosphates was not changed by the treatment with alpha-LA. These results give tentative support to the hypothesis that alpha-LA improves memory in aged mice, probably by a partial compensation of NMDA receptor deficits. Possible modes of action of alpha-LA based on its free radical scavenger properties are discussed in relation to the membrane hypothesis of aging.", 
    "59": "There are multiple potential interactions of substances of abuse with psychiatric illnesses. The individual agents, the stage of abuse, withdrawal, or recovery, and the patient's psychiatric illness must be considered as an integrated whole to ascertain the appropriate interventions. Polysubstance abuse can cause still more complicated interactions. Assessment of differential treatment needs for both the psychiatric illness component and the substance use disorder component permits both elements to be approached, often simultaneously, and can facilitate treatment of both. Ignoring either component can lead to inappropriate treatment or exacerbation of illness. The high rate of comorbidity of chemical dependence and other psychiatric illnesses is intriguing in light of studies that demonstrate vulnerability to drug abuse associated with specific alleles of the dopamine D2 receptor gene in some families. It is hoped that further investigations will shed light on the complex interactions and associations between chemical dependency and other psychiatric illnesses and result in new treatment strategies for both. In the past, many substance abuse treatment programs used to emphasize the complete cessation of all medications including some potentially beneficial prescription medications. This was likely because of previous excessive prescription by physicians of sedatives or benzodiazepines. Increasingly, recovery programs support intelligent, responsible use of nonaddictive psychiatric medications, and AA World Services prints a pamphlet supporting such physician-supervised use. Conversely, psychiatrists previously frequently overlooked or neglected diagnosis and treatment of chemical-dependency disorders. Greater efforts are needed to focus equal energy on diagnosis and treatment of chemical-dependency disorders in \"psychiatric\" populations. Many studies show that physicians neglect to collect adequate information and are not sufficiently aggressive in referring patients to chemical dependence treatment programs. By combining knowledge and appropriate therapeutic interventions from both psychiatric and addiction treatment fields, the needs of the dually diagnosed patient can be met more adequately.", 
    "60": "Several medications may help improve treatment of alcoholic patients. Medications that effectively and specifically reverse symptoms of alcohol intoxication or coma currently are lacking. Benzodiazepines remain the most effective medications for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and for the prevention of withdrawal seizures and delirium, even though the adrenergic agents clonidine or atenolol may hasten resolution of withdrawal symptoms and facilitate outpatient detoxification. Psychosocial rehabilitation of alcoholics may be improved by judicious addition of the alcohol-sensitizing agents disulfiram and carbimide, the serotonergic drugs fluoxetine and buspirone, the opiate antagonist naltrexone, and, for primarily depressed alcoholics, tricyclic antidepressants. As in psychosocial alcohol rehabilitation, patient-treatment matching may improve results of pharmacotherapeutic intervention.", 
    "61": "Benzodiazepine receptors are expressed very early in the brain during embryonic life, suggesting that endogenous ligands for these receptors may play an important role during ontogenesis in the central nervous system. In the present study, the distribution and characterization of diazepam-binding inhibitor-related peptides (endozepines) in the rat brain was investigated during embryonic and postnatal development using an antibody raised against the biologically active region of the precursor molecule. Immunohistochemical labelling showed that, in newborn rats, endozepine-like immunoreactivity was present in ependymal cells of the hypothalamus. Although the number of positive cells increased by day 5, the intensity of the immunoreaction in each cell diminished. In 15-day-old rats, both the number of endozepine positive cells and the intensity of the immunoreaction increased in the ependymal layer. At day 40, a dense accumulation of immunoreactive tanycytes and glial cells was observed in the median eminence and the arcuate nucleus. Endozepines were detected by radioimmunoassay in all regions of the brain as early as embryonic day 18. The concentration of endozepine-related peptides increased in the hypothalamus and olfactory bulb during late gestation. Between birth and postnatal day 5, the levels of endozepines decreased two- to four-fold in all brain regions studied. Thereafter, endozepine concentration increased gradually until day 25. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of tissue extracts revealed that the olfactory bulb, pituitary, hypothalamus and cerebellum contained only one immunoreactive peak eluting at 39 min (peak C). In the telencephalon two peaks were observed: peak C and a second one eluting at 34 min (peak B). Peak B was present as early as embryonic day 20 and the ratio peak B/peak C gradually increased until day 25. At day 25 peak B was also detected in hippocampus, medulla oblongata, cortex and striatum extracts. In any brain region, no immunoreactivity co-eluting with the octadecaneuropeptide was observed. Sephadex G-50 gel filtration of hypothalamus extracts of 25-day-old animals, confirmed the existence of only one immunoreactive compound with an apparent molecular weight of 10,000. In the telencephalon two major species were resolved, with apparent molecular weights of 10,000 and 8800, and a minor one of 6500 mol. wt. In conclusion, the present study shows that endozepines are expressed in the rat brain as early as embryonic day 18 and the amount of endozepine-like material increases rapidly during the two days preceding birth. The results also indicate that diazepam-binding inhibitor is processed to different molecular forms depending on the brain region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "62": "The effects of chronic 'continuous' and 'intermittent' L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine treatments on GABA receptor function in the basal ganglia of rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle was investigated, by autoradiography with [3H]flunitrazepam. The 6-hydroxydopamine lesion itself, increased [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (+17%, with respect to intact side) and entopeduncular nucleus (+44%), but decreased binding in the globus pallidus of the denervated hemisphere (-20%). 'Intermittent' L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment reduced the [3H]flunitrazepam binding changes observed in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (-13%) and entopeduncular nucleus (-4%), whereas 'continuous' infusion of the same daily dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine had less effect (+14%, substantia nigra pars reticulata; +26%, entopeduncular nucleus). In contrast, the [3H]flunitrazepam binding decrease in the globus pallidus of the 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned animals was unaffected by either regime of chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment. The changes in GABA receptor function implied by these results provide further insight into the pathophysiological effects of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment on basal ganglia function, following dopamine denervation. In accordance with existing electrophysiological and biochemical evidence on this subject, the main implications of these results include reduced GABA sensitivity of neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, following chronic 'intermittent', but not chronic 'continuous' L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment; this may be due to a reversal of the 6-hydroxydopamine induced decrease in the GABA-mediated neurotransmission in the striatoentopeduncular and striatonigral pathways. In contrast, the regulation of GABA receptors in the globus pallidus does not appear to be subject to modulation by chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine administration, suggesting that dopamine replacement in this manner does not modify the 6-hydroxydopamine induced increase in GABA-mediated neurotransmission in the stratopallidal pathway.", 
    "63": "The mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR) appears to be a key factor in the flow of cholesterol into mitochondria to permit the initiation of steroid hormone synthesis. The mBzR consists of three components; the 18-kDa component on the outer mitochondrial membrane appears to contain the benzodiazepine binding site, and is hence often termed the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Using a cloned human PBR cDNA as probe, we have cloned the human PBR gene. The 13-kb gene is divided into four exons, with exon 1 encoding only a short 5' untranslated segment. The 5' flanking DNA lacks TATA and CAAT boxes but contains a cluster of SP-1 binding sites, typical of \"house-keeping\" genes. The encoded PBR mRNA is alternately spliced into two forms: \"authentic\" PBR mRNA retains all four exons, while a short form termed PBR-S lacks exon 2. While PBR-S contains a 102-codon open reading frame with a typical initiator sequence, the reading frame differs from that of PBR, so that the encoded protein is unrelated to PBR. RT-PCR and RNase protection experiments confirm that both PBR and PBR-S are expressed in all tissues examined and that expression PBR-S is about 10 times the level of PBR. Expression of PBR cDNA in pCMV5 vectors transfected into COS-1 cells resulted in increased binding of [3H]PK11195, but expression of PBR-S did not. It has been speculated that patients with congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, who cannot make any steroids, might have a genetic lesion in mBzR. RT-PCR analysis of testicular RNA from such a patient, sequencing of the cDNA, and blotting analysis of genomic DNA all indicate that the gene and mRNA for the PBR component of mBzR are normal in this disease.",

To characterize LV asynchronies, 16 anesthetized dogs with critical stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were instrumented to measure subendocardial contractile function (sonomicrometry) and the ECG in the LAD territory. The subendocardial ECG was also recorded from the anterior basal LV territory. Time of regional S wave arrival (TS) and time of onset of segment shortening were determined. The animals underwent atrial pacing with increasing frequencies until systolic LAD territory contractile dysfunction and eventual LV asynchronies were observed. Six animals without LAD stenosis served as controls to define the normal response (mean +/- 2.SD) to increasing pacing rates of systolic shortening and onset time of segment shortening (time difference between TS and onset of segment shortening). LAD contractile dysfunction was considered as a systolic shortening below the normal range, and LV asynchronies as an onset time of segment shortening above the normal range. When LV asynchronies occurred, onset time of segment shortening in the LAD territory was 80.1 +/- 4.9 ms versus 14.8 +/- 3.7 ms at control (P < 0.01); the time difference between S wave arrival in the LAD and circumflex territories, however, was unchanged. LV asynchronies were associated with marked LAD territory contractile dysfunction (systolic shortening of 9.6 +/- 0.8% v 21.0 +/- 1.9% at control, after systolic shortening of 31.3 +/- 3.8% v 9.0 +/- 2.6% at control; P < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "70": "Total intravenous anesthesia with droperidol, fentanyl and ketamine (DFK) was given to over three thousand patients during four years from April 1989 through March 1993. The patients ranged in age from three months to eighty seven years. They underwent surgical, orthopedic, gynecological, thoracic, plastic and otolaryngeal surgeries, but patients who underwent craniotomy and obstetric operations were excluded. None of them developed any serious complications primarily due to DFK. DFK has many advantages such as the broad safety margin for three agents employed in DFK, no accident by N2O, no air pollution, empty bowels, no increase in middle ear pressure etc, while this has disadvantages such as high blood pressure, slow awakening from anesthesia and unpleasant dreams. Calcium channel blockers are very effective for antagonizing high blood pressure, and rapid recovery from anesthesia can be easily obtained by reducing ketamine dose given and also by application of epidural block. Intraoperative dreams may be avoided by concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Thus we are convinced that DFK can be a good as well as convenient anesthetic method for clinical anesthesia.", 
    "71": "Lesions of brain areas thought to promote anxiety do not diminish the anticonflict effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs). After initial training in the lick-suppression conflict test, eight rats received electrolytic lesions of the amygdala, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, and mammillary bodies. Ten others received sham lesions. Postoperative testing revealed a significant increase in punished licking at two stages after surgery in lesioned animals when compared with their own preoperative baseline levels and with the punished licking of control animals. Systemic administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 2.5-10.0 mg/kg) resulted in a comparable dose-dependent increase in punished licking in both groups. These results suggest that the several structures lesioned need not be intact for CDP to have an antianxiety effect. It appears that sites of anxiolytic action are much more widely spread than currently believed and that other brain areas should be considered.",

Rats were given either peripheral or intracerebroventricular injections of methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), a drug that has been shown to act at the benzodiazepine-GABAA complex and produces a behavioral state similar to anxiety. Rats were then immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and serum levels of KLH-specific antibody were measured for 2 weeks after immunization. Both peripheral and central administration of DMCM modulated the in vivo antibody response. The dose-response relationship of DMCM and changes in antibody levels was nonmonotonic, with high doses resulting in an increase in serum antibody levels and moderate doses resulting in a decrease in serum antibody levels.

We examined the effects of intravenous induction of general anaesthesia using the benzodiazepines midazolam, diazepam and flunitrazepam on MLAEP in 30 patients scheduled for minor gynaecological procedures. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.2-0.3 mg.kg-1, Group I, n = 10), diazepam (0.3-0.4 mg.kg-1, Group II, n = 10) or flunitrazepam (0.03-0.04 mg.kg-1, Group III, n = 10). Auditory-evoked potentials were recorded before and five to ten minutes after induction of general anaesthesia. Latencies of the peak V, Na, Pa, Nb and Pl (ms) and amplitudes Na/Pa, Pa/Nb and Nb/P1 (microV) were measured. In the awake state, MLAEP had high peak to peak amplitudes and a periodic waveform. After induction of anaesthesia there was no or only a small increase in latencies of the peaks Na, Pa, Nb and P1, which was significant only for P1 in the midazolam group. Amplitudes Na/Pa, Pa/Nb and Nb/P1 decreased only slightly and which reached statistical significance only for Na/Pa in the flunitrazepam group. The MLAEPs do not change markedly in amplitude or latency during induction of general anaesthesia with benzodiazepines.

A number of pharmacologic agents have been studied in social phobia, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, and benzodiazepines. This paper reviews the findings of several open and double-blind clinical trials using the LSAS and other measures. Promising results have been achieved with some pharmacologic agents, although further controlled trials are necessary.", 
    "82": "The likelihood that a given drug will be misused is related to its ability to alter mood, feeling, thinking, and perception in a manner that is liked by substance abusers. The subjective and behavioral effects of diazepam (10, 20, and 40 mg), pentobarbital (120 and 240 mg as a positive control), and placebo (negative control), were evaluated in 12 subjects with histories of substance abuse by use of a double-blind, Latin square crossover study design. Drug administration was separated by a minimum of 3 days. Pharmacodynamic measures included subjective (euphoria, subject liking, sedation, and symptoms) and behavioral (signs and observed liking) responses. The time course and profile of subjective and behavioral responses were similar for diazepam and pentobarbital. Valid relative potency estimates for the pharmacodynamic measures indicated that diazepam is approximately 10 times as potent as pentobarbital. The study indicates that the reinforcing effects of diazepam are similar to pentobarbital in substance abusers.", 
    "83": "Although it is frequently stated that patients with cirrhosis are more sensitive to benzodiazepines, the relative roles of impaired elimination and altered responsiveness have not been clarified. We evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and sensitivity to triazolam in six patients with clinically stable cirrhosis and six age-matched control subjects. Our findings show that there were no significant differences between the patients with cirrhosis and the control subjects in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters. Drug effect, measured as postural sway, was also similar in the patients with cirrhosis and control subjects; therefore the ratio of effect area under the curve to concentration area under the curve, a measure of sensitivity, did not differ significantly between the patients with cirrhosis and the control subjects. Because triazolam is metabolized by P4503A, we hypothesized that the effects of cirrhosis on drug metabolism may differ with respect to the specific P450 responsible for the oxidation of this drug. These effects may differ because of the relative sparing of a specific P450 and because of an extrahepatic site of metabolism.", 
    "84": "Drug abuse during pregnancy has attracted national attention, but most studies are from large cities. This study is concerned with the indigent pregnant patients in a midsized city in the southeastern United States. In a 23-month study, 2,442 patients were delivered of neonates. Using specific criteria, 511 patients were tested for drug abuse. A positive test was identified in 156 (31%), cocaine being the most common agent. During 2 months of random testing, 15 patients (16%) had positive drug screens. Comparison of drug-positive pregnant patients with general obstetric patients identified many adverse obstetric and perinatal outcome data. Drug-positive patients weighed less, were older, were prone to not seek prenatal care, and were more likely to deliver prematurely and have a growth-retarded infant. Drug abuse in this population had significant impact on the health of the patient and her unborn infant.", 
    "85": "We have measured the postnatal development and GABA modulation of benzodiazepine receptors in neuronal membranes from vitamin B-6 deficient and normal rats. In rats fed vitamin B-6 adequate and deficient diets there were age-dependent changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding site affinity and in the number of binding sites. Vitamin B-6 deficiency produced a significant reduction in the potency of GABA to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cortical membranes prepared from 14 day old rats. These results suggests an uncoupling of the GABAa/benzodiazepine receptor at a developmental period when the animals are most susceptible to spontaneous seizures.", 
    "86": "Five unrelated patients are described with the clinical and electrical features of eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA). In this syndrome brief, typical absences occur with rapid eyelid myoclonia associated with retropulsive movements of the eyeballs and occasionally of the head. The seizures are of shorter duration than in childhood absence epilepsy, and are accompanied by less profound impairment of consciousness. The electroencephalogram demonstrates high amplitude discharges consisting of spikes, multiple spikes and slow waves at a fluctuating frequency of 3-5 Hz and following eye closure, which disappear in darkness. Photosensitivity is also seen. Onset is in early childhood and EMA appears to persist into adult life. Treatment is sodium valproate in combination with either ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine. On the basis of the clinical features, EEG findings, and the response to treatment and prognosis, it is suggested that EMA be classified as a specific epilepsy syndrome.", 
    "87": "Midazolam, if used with ketamine for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, may attenuate hyperdynamic circulatory effects and prevent undesirable emergenic reactions. The nature of the interaction between midazolam and ketamine used for anesthesia induction was studied in female patients.", 
    "88": "Quantal dose-response curves were determined in 170 female patients for the drugs, individually and in combination. Two endpoints were assessed, loss of response to verbal command (hypnosis) and loss of response to a 5-s transcutaneous tetanus (anesthesia). At the hypnotic endpoint, interactions were analyzed by fitting the data to a mathematical model in which the response was analyzed in terms of the doses of the two drugs, and an additional term was included to describe nonadditive interactions. At the anesthetic endpoint, the decrease in ED50 of ketamine in the presence of midazolam was assessed because dose-related effects could not be demonstrated for midazolam alone.", 
    "89": "At the hypnotic endpoint, the ED50s were: 0.15 mg/kg midazolam (95% CIs 0.11-0.38 mg/kg), 0.37 mg/kg ketamine (95% CIs 0.08-0.44 mg/kg), and the combination of 0.086 mg/kg midazolam and 0.27 mg/kg ketamine (95% CIs 0.07/0.22-0.10/0.31 mg/kg), respectively. The hypnotic effects were found to be additive, and there was no evidence of an interaction. At the anesthetic endpoint, the ED50 of ketamine alone was 0.57 mg/kg (95% CIs 0.47-0.69) and the ED50 for ketamine in the presence of midazolam was also 0.57 mg/kg (95% CIs 0.48-0.79); 0.18 mg/kg midazolam was given at this point. Midazolam had no influence on the anesthetic dose of ketamine.",

    "91": "Previous research has been unable to show unequivocally whether flumazenil can reverse completely, partially, or not at all the memory effects of benzodiazepines. The effects of midazolam on implicit memory are also unknown. The behavioral effects of flumazenil by itself, and the acute reversal of benzodiazepine effects, are also controversial. The current study was designed to investigate these questions.", 
    "92": "Using a prospective randomized, double-blind crossover study design, memory was assessed using both direct (free recall and recognition) and indirect (word completion) measures. Other cognitive effects were assessed using the digit symbol substitution task. Sedation and other mood effects were assessed using subjective rating scales. Seventy-two healthy subjects were assigned to three equal groups according to the dose of midazolam received (0, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg). Each subject received varying doses of flumazenil (0, 1, and 3 mg) in three sessions, at least 1 week apart. After baseline administration of the tasks, midazolam was administered. The assessments were repeated 20 min later, followed by administration of flumazenil. The assessments were repeated 5 and 30 min after administration of flumazenil. After a 2-h recovery period, delayed memory tests were given.", 
    "93": "Both doses of midazolam decreased all scores in the memory and digit symbol substitution tests and mood ratings. Flumazenil reversed both the sedative and the memory effects of the benzodiazepine. The reversal was as complete with the 1-mg dose of flumazenil as with the 3-mg dose. Flumazenil by itself, and the acute reversal of midazolam effects, caused no significant behavioral reactions.", 
    "94": "Midazolam impairs explicit and implicit memory. Flumazenil reverses both the sedative and memory effects of the drug. Flumazenil, in the doses used, has no intrinsic actions.", 
    "95": "A cDNA encoding the human gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor beta 2 subunit has been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA shows only a single amino acid change from the rat sequence (Asn-347 in rat, serine in human). Using polymerase chain reaction amplification of human-specific products from human x rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs, the gene has been assigned to human chromosome 6. By expressing recombinant human GABAA receptors containing different beta subunits (beta 1, beta 2 or beta 3) in both transfected cells and Xenopus oocytes, we have been able to determine the influence of the beta subunit on the pharmacology of the receptor. For a number of benzodiazepine binding site compounds, a barbiturate, and several neurosteroids, neither the affinity nor the efficacy of the compounds is influenced by the type of beta subunit present in the receptor molecule. These data suggest that the beta subunit does not significantly influence the benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or steriod site pharmacologies of human GABAA receptor subtypes.", 
    "96": "We have examined the effects of GABA and several GABAA receptor modulators on isolated rat (1-160 days) superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons with whole-cell recordings. The neurons were sensitive to GABA within 12 h after birth, and the relationship between the current amplitude and GABA concentration (GABA50 = 19 microM) in these newborn neurons was fitted with a Hill coefficient close to 1.0. Adult neurons, on the other hand, had a GABA50 value of 30 microM, and the slope was steeper and fitted with a Hill coefficient of 1.6. Unlike the results of previous studies in cultured SCG neurons, we found that the concentration of Zn++ that reduced the response by 50% was 37 +/- 12 microM in newborns and 43 +/- 6 microM in adults. Bicuculline (10 microM) inhibited the current by 41 +/- 6% and 36 +/- 11% in newborn and adult neurons, respectively. With 5 microM GABA, diazepam and pentobarbital potentiated the response in newborn and adult neurons. No changes were found in the sensitivity of the receptor for these ligands, but their efficacy was enhanced 2-fold during development. Diazepam shifted the relationship between GABA and the response to the left in all the neurons studied. Ethanol (40 mM) reduced the amplitude of the GABA current to 64 +/- 12% of control in newborn neurons and to 85 +/- 4% in adult neurons. The inhibitory effect of 100 mM ethanol on the GABA current was noncompetitive. Addition of a very large concentration of ethanol (850 mM) to newborn neurons potentiated the response to 164 +/- 13% of control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "97": "There is a dynamic interaction between a drug's pharmacological effects and the behavioral context in which it is administered. The present study evaluated the influence of behavioral processes on the development of tolerance and cross-tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of chlordiazepoxide in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats responded under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food delivery. Different groups of rats received 18 mg/kg/day of chlordiazepoxide either before (PRE, n = 8) or after (POST, n = 10) daily experimental sessions for 8 weeks. Cumulative dose-response curves for chlordiazepoxide were obtained before and during chronic chlordiazepoxide administration and during chronic saline administration. Cumulative dose-response curves for midazolam, FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) flumazenil, pentobarbital, caffeine, morphine and d-amphetamine were determined before, during and 4.5 to 5 months after chronic chlordiazepoxide administration. Group PRE developed tolerance to chlordiazepoxide, whereas group POST did not develop tolerance. Although cross-tolerance developed to midazolam in both groups, it was greater in group PRE. Both groups showed comparable sensitization to FG7142 and neither group showed a significant change in sensitivity to any of the other drugs. Biochemical studies of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related functioning in groups of rats that received chronic chlordiazepoxide administration either before (BIO-PRE, n = 6) or after (BIO-POST, n = 6) daily sessions found that GABA-stimulated 36Cl-uptake increased in both cortical and cerebellar preparations. However, GABA sensitivity in cerebellar tissue was significantly lower in group BIO-PRE compared with group BIO-POST. Thus, behavioral tolerance to chlordiazepoxide was associated with both pharmacological and biochemical effects, which suggests a relationship between behavioral tolerance to benzodiazepines and changes in the functional state of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "98": "Abecarnil is a beta-carboline agonist at benzodiazepine receptors with potent anxiolytic activity but no muscle relaxant side effects in rodents. Clinical experience suggests that changes in the muscle tone induced by benzodiazepines are related to their effects on spinal reflexes. The authors therefore analyzed the effect of treatment with abecarnil on spinal monosynaptic (Hoffmann reflexes) and polysynaptic (flexor) reflexes in mice and the influence of abecarnil on muscle tone in genetically spastic rats. The i.v. administration of abecarnil in mice (dose range, 0.02-1 mg/kg) depressed flexor reflexes in a dose-dependent manner; Hoffmann reflexes remained unchanged. Administration of diazepam i.v. (0.01-1 mg/kg) also reduced flexor reflexes and had little or no effect on Hoffmann reflexes. In genetically spastic rats, i.v. administration of abecarnil (10-30 mg/kg) decreased the muscle tone in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A similar muscle relaxant effect was observed in such rats after i.v. administration of diazepam (0.1-0.8 mg/kg). By contrast, i.p. administration of abecarnil in mice did not influence spinal reflexes up to the dose of 1 mg/kg and, in genetically spastic rats, did not affect muscle tone up to the dose of 100 mg/kg. Administration of diazepam i.p. (1 mg/kg) depressed flexor reflexes in mice and over the range 0.2 to 5 mg/kg produced a dose- and time-dependent decrease of muscle tone in genetically spastic rats. The muscle relaxant effect of i.p. diazepam could be antagonized by i.p. administered abecarnil. These studies thus demonstrate that i.v. but not i.p. administration of abecarnil may result in muscle relaxant action in mice and in genetically spastic rats.", 
    "99": "Lorazepam kinetics were examined in seven healthy males age 18 to 30 years after single- and multiple-dose lorazepam administration and in the presence and absence of neomycin and cholestyramine to block the enterohepatic circulation of the drug. Methods used a simultaneous i.v./p.o. dosing regimen with provision to measure lorazepam clearance during day- and night-time dosing intervals. The day-time steady-state clearance of free lorazepam measured 7.55 +/- 1.95 ml/min/kg (mean +/- S.D.) and was identical to that observed after single-dose administration (7.68 +/- 3.19 ml/min/kg). Neomycin and cholestyramine increased lorazepam clearances 5 to 45% (P < or = .05) as would be expected for interruption of an enterohepatic circulation and in keeping with previous observations under nonsteady-state conditions. Lorazepam clearances were the same during the day as during the night, except in the presence of neomycin and cholestyramine, where night-time clearances were significantly greater (10.16 +/- 3.52 vs. 8.77 +/- 2.43 ml/min/kg, P < or = .05). Urinary recoveries of lorazepam glucuronide, on the other hand, were greater during the day than during the night (114 +/- 11 vs. 77 +/- 15%, P < or = .05) and in all cases were greater than 100% of the administered dose for that interval. Thus, there is a diurnal variation in lorazepam elimination consistent with a fasting-induced increase in hepatic glucuronidation during the night. This, combined with the relative inactivity of the gut during this period, serves to trap the glucuronide and delay its transfer back to the systemic circulation and urine."
