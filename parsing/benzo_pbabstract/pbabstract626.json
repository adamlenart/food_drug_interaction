    "0": "In in situ experiments on spinal rats transected at the C1 level and on non-spinal rats, muscimol (3 mg/kg, i.v.) depolarized the primary afferent fibers and diazepam (3 mg/kg, i.v.) potentiated this effect of muscimol. When diazepam was given for 14 days, the effect of muscimol was significantly reduced in non-spinal rats. These findings suggest that diazepam probably interacts with GABA-ergic mechanisms more closely in supraspinal regions of the rat.", 
    "1": "1 Eight patients with end-stage renal insufficiency on maintenance haemodialysis, and seven patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism, received a single intravenous dose of diazepam, followed by blood sampling over the next 7 days. Fifteen healthy volunteer controls, matched with patients for age and sex, were similarly studied. 2 Diazepam half-life in renal failure patients (mean 37 h) was greatly reduced compared to controls (mean 92 h, P less than 0.05) and clearance of total (free plus bound) diazepam correspondingly increased (0.94 v 0.34 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.01). 3 However, differences were largely related to disease-related changes in drug binding and distribution. Mean unbound fraction of diazepam in plasma of renal patients (7.0%) was greatly increased over controls (1.4%, P less than 0.01) and Vd of unbound diazepam greatly reduced (57 v 157 l/kg, P less than 0.01). 4 Clearance of pharmacologically active unbound diazepam (intrinsic clearance) was not significantly different between renal patients and controls (23 vs 30 ml min-1 kg-1). 5 None of the kinetic variables for total or unbound diazepam in thyrotoxic patients differed significantly from those in controls matched for age and sex. 6 End-stage renal failure (or its associated drug therapy) alters diazepam protein binding and distribution, but does not significantly change clearance of unbound drug. Thyrotoxicosis does not influence diazepam kinetics.", 
    "2": "Recent advances in technology have fueled interest in the field of urodynamics and have made possible accurate diagnosis of voiding abnormalities in children. A thorough understanding of the underlying physiology and institution of the appropriate pharmacologic agents and/or teaching techniques results in correction of the underlying problems in 90% of the cases. Symptoms, techniques of diagnosis, therapeutic regimens, and results of therapy are presented.", 
    "3": "After i.v. administration of 2 mg/kg diazepam to dogs, concentrations of unmetabolized drug showed a triexponential decline with an average elimination half-life t0.5(beta) of 3.2 hr. Desmethyldiazepam appeared rapidly in plasma and exceeded diazepam concentrations by far. Elimination half-lives of this metabolite averaged 3.6 hr. Oxazepam reached maximal plasma concentrations in the range of 100 ng/ml after about 2 hr which then declined with a half-life of 5.7 hr. When the sum of the concentrations of diazepam and its active metabolites was plotted against time, the curve could be fitted by an open 2-compartment model, so that one of the apparent 3 compartments in the distribution of diazepam must be assumed to represent first pass demethylation to desmethyldiazepam. After oral administration of the same dose, desmethyldiazepam concentrations exceeded those of diazepam from the first blood sample taken. The share of unmetabolized diazepam in the total area under curve was only 1-3% after oral administration, but 7-21% after i.v. administration. Oral bioavailability was in the range of 74-100%. By continued oral administration of 1 or 2 mg/kg diazepam t.i.d. it was possible to maintain steady state plasma concentrations of 1000-2000 ng/ml desmethyldiazepam and maximal diazepam concentrations of 100-800 ng/ml. Oxazepam did not exceed a concentration of 100-200 ng/ml and small concentrations of 3-hydroxydiazepam could also be detected in these experiments. There was no indication of enzyme induction by this dose regimen. Both diazepam and desmethyldiazepam rapidly passed the blood/CSF barrier and reached steady state concentrations is CSF corresponding to the part not bound to serum proteins.", 
    "4": "In a suicide attempt a fifty year old woman took 100-200 tablets of barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Subsequently cardiac arrest occurred. Although the prognosis seemed infaust, full clinical recovery took place within a short time. The protection by barbiturates seems to be based on an inhibitory effect on cerebral oxidative enzymes. The maintenance of ventilation and blood pressure as well as the avoidance of pulmonary complications is crucial.", 
    "5": "Phocid seals were immobilized safely and repeatedly, using a combination of ketamine and diazepam at mean IM or IV dosages of 1.5 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. Induction and recovery were smoother than with ketamine used alone. Experimentally induced pneumonia did not alter the effects of the drugs, thus attesting to the safety of the ketamine-diazepam combination.", 
    "6": "In-vitro experiments were made to compare specific binding of 3H-diazepam with synaptic membranes obtained from the large hemispheres of rats trained the defense conditioned reflex to that in rats exposed to non-combined stimuli (active control). Within the concentration range of 0.37 nM-30 nM, specific binding of 3H-diazepam with the synaptic membranes obtained from the brain of active control animals was considerably higher than that with the synaptic membranes obtained from the trained animals brain.", 
    "7": "The absorption of rectal diazepam solution was studied in 22 children aged 1-9 yr by measuring serum concentrations. The mean dose was 0.27 +/- 0.09 mgkg-1. The mean serum concentration was 98.5 +/- 53.5 ng ml-1 4 min after administration and 206.7 +/- 105.8 ng ml-1 at 11 min. The correlation between dose and serum concentration was statistically significant at both times. With a dose of 0.4-05 mgkg-1 an adequate serum concentration was achieved within 5-6 min. No side-effects were observed. A rectal solution provides a faster, more effective and reliable alternative to tablets and suppositories, and to the uncertain i.m. injection of diazepam. Meticulous nursing is important.", 
    "8": "Venous sequelae were studied in 93 female patients undergoing minor gynaecological procedures. They were premedicated with diazepam i. v. dissolved in a fat emulsion (Diazemuls) injected to a superficial vein of the right hand. The patients observed the site of injection for 14 days and recorded their findings. Twenty-eight per cent reported mild tenderness and 7.5% mild or moderate swelling of short duration. Signs of thrombophlebitis were found in 2.2%. Thrombophlebitis after injection can be prevented effectively and safely using fat emulsion as a solvent for diazepam.", 
    "9": "Generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus is a relatively common neurologic emergency. The differential diagnosis of this condition includes decerebrate spasms and hysterical seizures. Initial therapy includes establishing an airway and securing an intravenous line. Blood should be obtained for chemistries and anticonvulsant levels. Administration of anticonvulsants should not be delayed until laboratory results are obtained. Intravenous diazepam will usually stop continuous tonic-clonic seizure activity, but because of a rapid redistribution phase, it necessitates administration of a longer acting anticonvulsant such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. Intravenous phenytoin should be administered slowly at a dose of 15 mg/kg while carefully monitoring vital signs. Intravenous phenobarbital produces sedation and may cause respiratory depression. Occasionally, other anticonvulsants such as paraldehyde, lidocaine, and general anesthesia will be needed to break status epilepticus. Careful follow-up of the patient and monitoring of the anticonvulsant levels may prevent future bouts of status epilepticus.", 
    "10": "Effects of renal insufficiency and age on oxazepam kinetics were assessed in 13 normal subjects (21 to 72 yr old), four patients with renal insufficiency, and eight patients on hemodialysis. Normal intact oxazepam results were: mean elimination half-life (t1/2), 10 hr; area under the curve (AUC), 6.0 microgram.hr/ml; unbound oxazepam fraction (fup), 3.2%; maximum concentration of unbound oxazepam (Cmax,u), 16 ng/ml; and intrinsic (unbound drug) clearance (Clint), 2.9 l/hr/kg. Less than 1% of the dose was excreted intact in urine. Age differences had no influence on results. In renal insufficiency patients, t1/2 was prolonged to 25 hr, fup increased to 7%, and Cmax,u and Clint were unchanged. Volume of distribution of unbound oxazepam (Vu) increased, thereby prolonging t1/2. In dialysis patients, t1/2 was prolonged to 33 hr, fup increased to 6.2%, and Cmax,u and Clint again were unchanged. Oxazepam was undialyzable; since unbound oxazepam disposition kinetics are not altered, no dosage adjustment for patients is necessary.", 
    "11": "Recovery from anesthesia was assessed in a controlled manner in 38 healthy student volunteers, using two psychomotor tests (perceptual speed and tapping board) and an instrumented force platform 1, 3, 5 and 7 h after intravenous injection of 0.3 mg/kg diazepam, 2.0 mg/kg methohexital, 6.0 mg/kg thiopental or saline. Postural stability remained unaltered but the performance on psychomotor tests improved when the tests were repeated after saline injection. Methohexital did not induce any changes in body sway or psychomotor performance at the time periods tested when compared with saline. Postural stability of subjects receiving thiopental or diazepam was imparied (P less than 0.001) for 1 and 7 hours after anesthesia, respectively, when compared with saline. The impairment on performance in the psychomotor tests induced by thiopental or diazepam was of smaller magnitude and for diazepam of shorter duration than balance disturbances measured with the body sway tests. Further clinical studies on the use of the instrumented force platform as a fast and easily interpretable guideline for discharge from hospital after different modes of outpatient anesthesia are warranted.", 
    "12": "Midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, with an elimination half-life of approximately 2 h, was compared with thiopentone for induction of general anaesthesia in a randomized, single-blind study. The patients were 60 healthy women undergoing legal abortion as outpatients. Midazolam provided smooth and reliable induction of anaesthesia with few side-effects. However, the induction time was considerably longer in the midazolam group (82.3 + 6.1) than in the thiopentone group (45.9 +/- 1.7s). The dose of midazolam required for induction was 0.36 +/- 0.01 mg/kg, while that of thiopentone was 6.43 +/- 0.21 mg/kg. Apnoea occurred with a frequency of 10% in the midazolam group and 55% in he thiopentone group, but was of equal duration in both groups. Circulatory conditions were more stable during induction with midazolam, with a slower fall in blood pressure and no change in heart rate. The patient were breathing O2/N2O in proportions of 1:2. To ensure adequate surgical anaesthesia, it was necessary to add halothane for short periods for all patients in the midazolam group and for 79% of the thiopentone group. Postoperatively, all patients who had received midazolam, but none induced with thiopentone, had anterograde amnesia; this lasted for more than 1 h. All patients in both groups could leave the hospital after routine postoperative observation for 3-4 h. Venous tolerance was good for both drugs.", 
    "13": "Haemodynamic responses to 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen during coronary artery surgery were investigated in 10 patients. Morphine, diazepam and pancuronium were given intravenously as both induction and maintenance anaesthesia. A significant decrease was seen in heart rate, arterial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate-systolic arterial pressure product, peripheral vascular resistance, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, dP/dT of the left ventricle and resistance as measured in the graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). No variations occurred in cardiac output, stroke volume, flow in the LAD-graft, pulmonary artery pressure or heart rate-systolic pulmonary artery pressure product or in dP/dT of the right ventricle. Pulmonary vascular resistance increased. It was concluded that left ventricular performance did not decrease and that no deterioration of the oxygenation to the myocardium seemed to occur.", 
    "14": "A controlled release formulation of diazepam was compared to equal daily dose of the trade tablet under single day and steady-state conditions. Virtually no differences were found in the mean steady-state concentrations of diazepam or its metabolites, N-desmethyldiazepam, when the subjects received the 5 mg trade table three times daily or the 15 mg controlled release formulation once daily. Similarly, there was no difference in mean diazepam or N-desmethyldiazepam plasma concentrations when single doses of the controlled release formulation were give to fed or fasted volunteers. These data indicate that the controlled release formulation produces plasma concentrations of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam comparable to those achieved with the same daily dose of the trade product given three times daily, suggesting that these regimens can be used interchangeably.", 
    "15": "1 The pharmacokinetics of diazepam following intravenous administration have been investigated in six normal volunteers and nine epileptic patients receiving chronic antiepileptic drug therapy. 2 After intravenous administration, serum diazepam levels declined biexponentially in all subjects. The elimination half-life was significantly shorter and the plasma clearance significantly higher in the patients than in the normal volunteers. 3 Serum N-desmethyldiazepam levels were higher and the time to peak serum concentration was earlier in the epileptic patients than in the controls. 4 It is suggested that the metabolism of diazepam is induced in patients treated with enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs, although a protein binding interaction between valproic acid and diazepam may contribute to the higher plasma clearance in the epileptic patients taking sodium valproate.", 
    "16": "The value of anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of some cases of lancinating pain is now established. The results in 170 consecutive cases in an ongoing series are reported with special reference to the efficacy of four anticonvulsants--carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin and valproate. The findings are discussed.", 
    "17": "Specific [3H]-diazepam binding and [3H]-GABA binding were measured in cortical membranes of untreated rats and rats which had been administered unlabeled diazepam (5.0 mg/kg, IP) thirty minutes prior to sacrifice. Washed and unwashed membranes from control animals showed identical levels of [3H]-diazepam binding. Unwashed membranes of diazepam-treated animals showed consistently and significantly lower binding of [3H]-diazepam than membranes derived from control animals and treated similarly. [3H]-GABA was almost non-existent in unwashed membranes of either group of animals. The binding capability of membranes of treated animals for [3H]-diazepam returned to control levels upon washing with buffer prior to the binding assay. The specific binding of [3H]-GABA in membranes derived from either group of animals also improved after the buffer washes. However, no difference could be detected in [3H]-GABA binding between control and diazepam-treated animals. The failure of diazepam to modulate [3H]-GABA binding in unwashed membranes and the participation of an endogenous inhibitory material repressing [3H]-GABA binding are discussed.", 
    "18": "The action of lorazepam was studied in photosensitive baboons. Animals were either naturally very photosensitive or rendered photosensitive by a previous injection of allylglycine. Intravenous administration of varying doses, from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg, of lorazepam blocked the myoclonus induced by intermittent light stimulation in all the animals. However, in the naturally photosensitive baboon the injection of lorazepam favoured the appearance of spontaneous myoclonus with no important EEG modification. This myoclonus is different from that induced by intermittent light stimulation, which is always preceded by spike-wave cortical discharges. Lorazepam-induced myoclonus appears during the period when the animal is not photosensitive and its origin is probably in the medulla or in the brain stem.", 
    "19": "This review summarizes the available medical literature about plasma norepinephrine, which as been used as an indicator of sympathetic neural activity in clinical cardiology. Plasma norepinephrine levels are elevated myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and the norepinephrine concentration varies with severity of disease. Patients with ischemic heart disease at rest show essentially normal plasma norepinephrine, but no studies have assessed norepinephrine levels during spontaneously occurring typical angina pectoris. Plasma norepinephrine also is increased during hypertension occurring after coronary bypass surgery or repair of aortic coarctation. Propranolol increases plasma norepinephrine, and acute withdrawal of propranolol does not. Sodium restriction increases plasma norepinephrine in healthy persons, but no information is available about its effect on patients with congestive heart failure. Insufficient data are available to make strong inferences about sympathetic activity in cardiomyopathy, essential hypertension or pulmonary hypertension, and little or no information is available about plasma norepinephrine in ventricular fibrillation without myocardial infarction, the mitral valve prolapse syndrome, digoxin effect, syndromes associated with prolonged electrocardiographic Q-T interval and the hyperkinetic heart syndrome.", 
    "20": "The benzodiazepines are generally safe and effective drugs with usually only minor side effects, dose-related sedation being the most common. A range of paradoxical effects can occur of which release of aggressive and hostile feelings has excited most attention. These responses are idiosyncratic however, as most patients report decrease of such feelings while taking benzodiazepines. Dependence on benzodiazepines with escalation of dosage and/or social abuse is uncommon set against their widespread use. Recently though, evidence has accumulated that patients on normal doses for prolonged periods can commonly experience withdrawal symptoms, often unpleasant and even severe. These drugs should be reserved for patients suffering from defined clinical anxiety syndromes and not used indiscriminately in patients with normal stress responses.", 
    "21": "Drug abuse was observed during 40 years (1939-1979) in a psychiatric hospital for women (sanatorium Sainte-Agathe, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium). Seventy patients were labelled with that diagnosis, -i.e. 2,9% of 2386 admissions. The frequency of drug addiction grew with years and between 1975 and 1979, outnumbered 10% of all admissions. 3/4 of those patients were previously inmates of other psychiatric clinics and well known in medical urgency services. Morphinomaniacs were the only patients between 1939 and 1949 (11 women). As a rule, they survived and did not come back. No haschich, L.S.D. or heroin addicts were seen: their psychiatric confinement was never required. Beginning in december 1959, barbituromaniacs (58 patients) invaded the wards. Other hypnotics were used as well (e.g. metaqualone). Forty-five per cent of the patients died and the survivors came back and back again, -en masse. The illness is very serious if it starts before 30 years: the risk of death goes to 75%. Barmaids and prostitutes were definitely doing hazardous jobs (5 deaths among 6 cases). Other psychiatric illnesses interfere with toxicomania, especially depression. Four patients committed suicide without hypnotics. To conclude: barbiturates are dangerous drugs and they ought not to be used for insomnia. Benzodiazepine abuse did not occur in the hospital and did not induce fatal issues. Combined with phenothiazines, benzodiazepines can solve nearly all sleep disturbances.", 
    "22": "The effects of four commonly used antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, clonazepam and dipropylacetate) on the uptake of amino acids were investigated in mouse cerebral slices. Phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin showed a net influence on the transport of the neutral amino acids that are also precursors of monoamine neurotransmitters, increasing their uptake. A similar effect was observed for diphenylhydantoin on GABA uptake. The increase in phenylalanine and valine uptake induced by phenobarbital was at least partly due to a decreased release of these metabolites. No major effects were observed for clonazepam and dipropylacetate. Our findings seem to indicate that some antiepileptic drugs may influence cerebral transport of neurotransmitter substances; further investigations are needed to find out whether these effects play a role in the antiepileptic action of these drugs.", 
    "23": "The purpose of this study was to determine the arousal effect of physostigmine after lormetazepam sedation on the human EEG. 12 male volunteers received 2 mg/kg bm lormetazepam and 30 minutes later physostigmine 2 mg preceded by atropine 1 mg. Generally an arousal effect of physostigmine could be clinically observed and more objectively demonstrated by reduced sleep stages in the vigilosomnogram (p less than 0.05). 2 volunteers did not fall asleep. 9 volunteers were awake 5-12 minutes after termination of physostigmine injection. 1 volunteer did not show any effect. Resedation and parasympathetic side effects did not occur. In earlier studies deep sleep stages after lormetazepam 1 or 2 mg/70 kg bm lasted 70 to 120 minutes. Physostigmine is recommended to counteract undesirable benzodiazepine induced sedation.", 
    "24": "The efficacy of dipotassium clorazepate (DPCA) and of diazepam (DP) as night-time premedication was tested against a placebo in a double-blind trial in 300 patients of all ages. Examination of the patients in the morning before anaesthesia showed that tachycardia, nausea and anxiety were considerably less in patients who had been premedicated with DPCA or DP. Relief from anxiety and restlessness according to standardized self-evaluation scale was most marked in the DPCA group. There were statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to the sleep pattern: 66 per cent of patients in the DPCA group fell asleep within the normal time of 2-15 minutes compared with 53 per cent in the DP group and 48 per cent in the placebo group. Uninterrupted sleep until the morning was experienced by about 70 per cent of patients who had been premedicated with DPCA as against 47 per cent and 31 per cent who had been given DP or a placebo respectively. The total sleeping period was normal or slightly prolonged in 73 and 74 per cent of patients who had received one or the other drug but in only 38 per cent of patients in the placebo group. As regarded the quality of sleep (quiet, uninterrupted sleep and feeling rested) the DPCA group considered it to have been much sounder than did the other groups. On account of its marked ataractic and sleep-protecting properties DPCA is considered to be the most suitable agent for night-time premedication.", 
    "25": "Antianxiety drugs, like other drugs used in psychiatry, can cause a wide range of adverse effects. Many physiological systems may be affected, but, as the main action of antianxiety drugs is on the central nervous system, this system is particularly vulnerable. All antianxiety drugs have the potential to produce untoward effects on higher cerebral functions, although the effect seen is also influenced by psychological and social factors. The most common effects is oversedation, which is a particular problem for the very young and the very old. It is also a serious problem for those who drive motor vehicles and may be a hazard when working in dangerous situations. Subjects are especially vulnerable when (a) antianxiety drugs are first introduced; (b) the dose is increased; and (c) these agents are taken in combination with alcohol and other drugs. Dependence on antianxiety drugs is well known, but only recently has it been recognised that dependence on benzodiazepines is a larger problem than previously realised. Other adverse effects are reviewed and summarised according to the system they predominantly affect. A review of this kind can easily give a biased impression of the dangers of antianxiety drugs; it should be made clear at the outset that many effects are rare, and in some instances a causal connection with the drug has not been established with certainty. Overall, benzodiazepines are the most widely used of all drugs and are remarkably safe-even when taken in massive overdoses. Some unwanted effects are readily preventable if antianxiety drugs are used with caution or avoided altogether in conditions where pathological disturbances of tissue sensitivity or drug disposition lead to exaggerated reactions. Particular care should be taken when prescribing these drugs for children and the elderly, and drugs that are not clearly essential for the well-being of the mother should be avoided during pregnancy and breast feeding. Antianxiety agents are grossly overprescribed. The frequency of occurrence of some adverse effects is therefore not so much a manifestation of the intrinsic toxicity of antianxiety drugs, but a reflection of their widespread use. Overprescribing and irrational prescribing also contribute to self-poisoning with these and other agents and to the cost of health services. The reasons for overprescribing are complex, but one contributing factor is the ready availability of effective antianxiety drugs.", 
    "26": "The time course of antirecall effect and grades of sedation after the oral administration of diazepam and lorazepam were determined in 120 patients. Three standard doses of each drug were employed. Grades of sedation following oral diazepam were dose related, with a latency of 30-60 min and duration of 120-150 min. All three doses of lorazepam produced significantly more sedation with a similar latency (30-60 min) but longer duration (more than 240 min). Peak frequencies of the antirecall effects of diazepam 10, 15, and 20 mg were 5, 20, and 30 per cent, respectively. The duration was about two hours. Peak frequencies of the antirecall effect after lorazepam 2, 3, and 4 mg were 30, 45, and 72 per cent, respectively. Latency of peak action was about 60-90 min for all the doses, but the duration, especially with 3 and 4 mg doses, was long (4 h).", 
    "27": "Pentobarbital reversibly increased Na+-dependent GABA binding to bovine cerebral cortex membranes. This effect was chloride-dependent. Kinetic analysis of [3H]GABA binding revealed an increase of the apparent number of binding sites. Pretreatment of the membranes with Triton X-100 extremely diminished the effect of pentobarbital on both [3H]GABA and [3H]flunitrazepam binding.", 
    "28": "The elimination half-life of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam increases with age, and this may cause prolongation of action after a single dose and delayed accumulation on multiple dosing in elderly patients. Since the total body clearance of chlordiazepoxide is also reduced, higher steady-state serum concentration is to be expected in patients over 60 years of age. Desmethyldiazepam, one of the active metabolites of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide with a long elimination half-life, also shows impaired elimination in old persons. Prolongation of half-life without changes in total body clearance has been demonstrated for nitrazepam and temazepam. In contrast, oxazepam and lorazepam do not show clinically significant changes of pharmacokinetics with age. The clinical implications of the different pharmacokinetic characteristics are discussed.", 
    "29": "The rat olfactory cortex slice has been used to investigate the effects of chlordiazepoxide on evoked field potentials and the release of endogenous amino acid neurotransmitters (aspartate, glutamate, GABA and possibly taurine) which accompany electrical stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract. When single, low frequency stimuli were employed, chlordiazepoxide (2 microM-1 mM) depressed the amplitude of the field potential correlate of the depolarizing actions of the lateral olfactory tract excitatory transmitter (aspartate?) although aspartate release was unaffected. The field potential correlate of GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition (late N-wave) was also depressed in amplitude but low drug concentrations (between approximately 2 and 50 microM) increased its peak duration . Effects of chlordiazepoxide on evoked inhibition were analyzed by giving paired stimuli such that the second stimulus occurred during the field potentials evoked by the first stimulus. Chlordiazepoxide (1-20 microM) increased the depression in amplitudes of the presynaptic massed action potential and late N-wave evoked by the second of a pair of stimuli compared with those evoked by the first stimulus suggesting that presynaptic inhibition was potentiated. These effects of chlordiazepoxide were accompanied by a significant reduction in aspartate release from the lateral olfactory tract terminals. Moreover, the drug effects on presynaptic inhibition and aspartate release were antagonized by picrotoxin (5 microM). On the other hand, chlordiazepoxide (1-50 microM) had no significant effect on postsynaptic inhibition. The results are discussed in terms of both the sites (presynaptic or postsynaptic) and mechanisms of action of chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "30": "A simple, sensitive and selective method for the determination of lorazepam in monkey plasma has been developed using high-performance liquid chromatography in a reversed-phase mode. The limit of detection for lorazepam in plasma is about 2 ng/ml. The method has been applied to plasma samples obtained from cynomolgus monkeys after oral doses of 0.15 mg/kg and intravenous doses of 0.05 mg/kg of lorazepam. In this species, mean peak plasma concentrations of 12 ng/ml occurred at 2 h after oral dosing and declined with a half-life of 2,5 h; the mean terminal half-life after intravenous dosing was 1.4 h.", 
    "31": "A rapid, sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay was developed for the determination of 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-4H-imidazo-[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxamide [I] and its 4-hydroxy metabolite, 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-4H-imidazo-[1,5-alpha] [1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxamide [II] in whole blood, plasma or urine. The assay for both compounds involves extraction into diethyl ether-methylene chloride (70:30) from blood, plasma, or urine buffered to pH 9.0. The overall recoveries of [I] and [II] are 92.0 +/- 5.4% (S.D.) and 90.3 +/- 4.9% (S.D.), respectively. The sensitivity limit of detection is 50 ng/ml of blood, plasma, or urine using a UV detector at 254 nm. The HPLC assay was used to monitor the blood concentration-time fall-off profiles, and urinary excretion profiles in the dog following single 1 mg/kg intravenous and 5 mg/kg oral doses, and following multiple oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day of compound [I].", 
    "32": "Upon irradiation with short-wavelength UV light the tranquillizer demoxepam is converted into a highly fluorescent product. This reaction serves as a sensitive and selective means of detection of low levels of demoxepam in e.g., serum after separation by means of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of mobile phase composition and time of irradiation on the intensity of the fluorescence signal has been studied. A residence time of about 2 min in the post-column photochemical reactor is optimal, band broadening being efficiently suppressed (delta t ca. 1 sec) by means of air segmentation. Linear calibration graphs are obtained over a three-orders of magnitude concentration range; the detection limit for demoxepam is about 100 pg. Further work has demonstrated that detection limits of between 40 and 100 pg can also be obtained for the photoproducts of the phenothiazines fenergan, largactil, levopromazine and nedaltran. The calibration graphs show good linearity and the analysis of spiked serum samples was successful.", 
    "33": "The beta-carbolines harmane and norharmane competitively inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) binding to deoxycholate-solubilized benzodiazepine receptors from calf cerebral cortex, with Ki in the micromolar range [3H]Propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]PrCC) binds to the soluble receptors with an affinity similar to its binding to particulate receptors (0.41 nM vs 0.48 nM, respectively). The component that binds [3H]PrCC displays a sedimentation profile on sucrose gradient centrifugation similar to that of [3H]FNZ binding component (sedimentation coefficient about 11S).", 
    "34": "Sixty cases of methaqualone ingestion have been reviewed from 1977 through 1980. Serum methaqualone concentrations, clinical information, and demographic data were studied in order to define the present status of abuse of this drug. The average user was a 27 year-old man who ingested Quaalude plus at least one additional drug (usually a narcotic analgesic, ethanol, a benzodiazepine, or a barbiturate, in that order). He was admitted to the emergency room with a depressed level of consciousness and a serum methaqualone concentration of 5 +/- 3 mg/L (mean +/- SD). Following a brief period of observation and supportive care, he was discharged from the hospital. Serum methaqualone concentrations showed no significant correlation with the physical findings, except that levels greater than or equal to 9 mg/L were always associated with a depressed level of consciousness, whether or not other drugs were present. Despite strict federal controls, methaqualone abuse appears to be a continuing problem, and analysis for this drug should be part of the toxicology screen.", 
    "35": "A retrospective study was undertaken to assess the range of blood methaqualone levels, which should be considered sufficient to produce deterioration of driving ability. Data from 974 driving-under-the influence (DUI) cases were subdivided into five major catagories based on whether drugs other than methaqualone were discovered during the analytical procedures. The range of blood methaqualone levels, which appear to cause significant motor skill impairment, are discussed for each category. Also included are data from 20 of these cases indicating the symptoms of methaqualone intoxication which were reported by arresting officers.", 
    "36": "A simple, rapid method for the determination of the benzodiazepines, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, and their metabolites by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been developed. The procedure is applicable to the assay of other similar drugs in biological fluids. The method utilizes BondElut extraction columns to facilitate the extraction. BondElut columns selectively adsorb the benzodiazepines and metabolites from serum at a pH of 9.0. The compounds are eluted with 300 microliters of methanol which makes sample concentration rapid, if even necessary. Analysis is performed using isocratic reversed-phase chromatography, and quantitation is carried out by ultraviolet (UV) detection. Using this procedure, it is possible to determine drug and metabolite levels to as low as 25 ng/ml in 0.5 ml of serum.", 
    "37": "Methadone maintenance patients who use benzodiazepine drugs were interviewed about the dosage levels, patterns, frequency and motives for their use of these drugs. The sample was drawn from two treatment clinics, one in Baltimore (N = 12) and one in Philadelphia (N = 17). Benzodiazepine use was prevalent at both of these clinics - 65 -70% of maintenance patients had positive urinalysis tests during a single month. Ninety-three per cent of survey participants identified diazepam as the drug which they used most often. The median value of the usual daily dose was 40 - 45 mg; 31% reported usual daily doses between 70 and 300 mg and 62% had experience with doses of 100 mg and higher. The majority of the sample reported taking diazepam in a single daily dose within one hour of the time that they ingested their daily methadone; 72% of the sample indicated that diazepam boosts the effects obtained from the daily methadone dose. Another sample of addicts who reported extensive experience with both benzodiazepines and barbiturates indicated that diazepam increases the effects of methadone while barbiturates produce no change in the effects of methadone. Results of this study suggest that patterns and dosages of diazepam use among methadone maintenance patients are primarily abusive rather than therapeutic.", 
    "38": "After a review of the literature stressing the biological factors underlying CNV genesis, the author sets up a tentative biological model of CNV, based on the neurophysiological and neurochemical findings of Skinner and Yingling (1977) and Marczynski (1978). In terms of balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes this model encompasses different CNV abnormalities in amplitude or duration frequently observed in mental pathology. The interest of such a model lies in the physiopathologic and therapeutic hypotheses it may lead to. In this respect, CNVs of prolonged duration, which would reflect a catecholaminergic hyperactivity, could constitute an indication for treatment by neuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines. CNVs with a weak amplitude would rather invite one to prescribe antidepressant drugs.", 
    "39": "It was demonstrated that the processes of lipid peroxidation in brain tissues of rats induced by hyperoxia and Fe-ascorbate system in vivo and in vitro significantly influence specific binding of serotonin and diazepam. Lipid peroxidation caused various changes in the ability to bind utilized ligands: 3H-serotonin binding decreased by 53%, while that of 3H-diazepam increased by 30%. Preliminary administration of the synthetic antioxidant 4-methyl-2,6-ditretbutylphenol prevented these changes.", 
    "40": "Because succinylcholine raised intraocular pressure, its use to facilitate tracheal intubation for ocular surgery, especially in emergency open-eye cases, has been a controversial topic among anaesthetists for more than two decades. In recent years, intravenous diazepam pretreatment before succinylcholine has been reported to reduce the untoward side effects of myalgia, and elevation of serum potassium and creatine phosphokinase. This study was designed to assess the effect of pretreatment with intravenous diazepam 0.1 mg kg-1 on control (base-line) intraocular pressure and to determine if such pretreatment diminished the rise in intraocular pressure following the standard anaesthesia induction sequence of thiopentone 3 - 5 mg kg-1., followed by tracheal intubation. Such diazepam pretreatment was shown to reduce the intraocular pressure from control levels and to diminish the rise of intraocular pressure following succinylcholine and tracheal intubation. Because succinylcholine produces rapid onset of neuromuscular block for tracheal intubation and since only minor intraocular pressure elevation occurs following thiopentone and succinylcholine in patients pretreated with diazepam, its use in ocular surgery, including emergency open-eye cases, can be rationally advocated. The addition of 0.6 mg kg-1 d-tubocurarine to the diazepam pretreatment did not produce a further reduction of the increase of intraocular pressure following succinylcholine.", 
    "41": "In rat experiments, the relative potency an safety of thiopentone, diazepam and etomidate were assessed using different indices of anaesthesia - loss of righting reflex, prevention of movement and heart rate responses to an noxious stimulus. Log-probit dose-response curves for these end-points and for lethal effect were determined. Etomidate proved to be more potent than thiopentone or diazepam; its relative potency figures varied from 5 to 18 with the use of different end-points of anaesthesia. According to the ED50 level of response for the loss of righting reflex and increased of heart rate, diazepam was more potent than thiopentone. At the same time it was less potent in the prevention of movement response. Etomidate has an extremely large standard safety margin (SSM) regarding the loss of righting reflex; with the use of movement response or heart rate response, the SSM for etomidate was close to that of thiopentone. With diazepam, SSM for movement response and heart rate response was negative (anaesthetic dose-response curve partially overlaps the lethal curve); it was positive for the loss of righting reflex. The extreme variability in assessment of relative potency and safety with different end-points of anaesthesia probably indicates that the indices used reflected various components of anaesthesia. It seems likely that for the proper assessment of the potency of intravenous anaesthetics, one index of potency is not sufficient. Several indices of potency corresponding to different components on general anaesthesia must be used.", 
    "42": "Individual variation occurs in time to induction of anaesthesia with intravenous drugs. Less free drug is available to cross the blood-brain barrier when the drug is highly protein bound. Since this may prolong time to sleep, we correlated the induction time, serum albumin and total protein concentrations, and doses of midazolam, which is a highly protein bound intravenous anaesthetic. There is a poor correlation (r = 0.062) between induction time and serum protein, a weak (r = 0.542) but statistically significant (p = 0.026) correlation between induction time and serum albumin, and a highly significant (p = 0.003) negative correlation (r = 0.579) between drug dose and induction time. The administration of the appropriate dose of midazolam for induction, therefore, appears to affect induction time more significantly than does the serum albumin concentration.", 
    "43": "A number of compounds known to accumulate in the blood of uremic patients were added to serum from healthy normal volunteers. It was observed that both hippuric acid and indican were capable of increasing substantially the serum f of both diazepam and warfarin. Furthermore, a mixture of nine different accumulation products (many of which did not measurably increase f when added alone) caused an even greater increase in the f of diazepam. Serum from uremic patients and from normal volunteers, with and without the addition of the compounds known to accumulate in uremia, wee treated by standard procedures (i.e., prolonged dialysis, charcoal treatment, pH alteration) to remove associated small molecules. The results of such treatments suggest that at least part of the diminished binding of drugs seen in the presence of uremia is due to the accumulation of low-molecular-weight endogenous competitors.", 
    "44": "Scant attention has been paid to the objective evaluation of insomnia as a function of age, particularly with reference to increased drug sensitivity and resulting loss in balance performance. Therefore, the electroencephalographic sleep and the balance-board performance of 10 young and 12 geriatric insomniacs were studied under baseline and hypnotic drug (ketazolam) conditions. In terms of objectively measured sleep, the geriatric insomniacs had worse sleep on every dimension except sleep latency and percentage of stage-2 sleep. These differences between aged and young insomniacs, however, were no greater than might be expected as a function of normal aging. Drug-age interactions indicated that ketazolam differentially increased sleep efficiency, decreased the percentage of REM sleep, and eliminated any learning improvement on the balance board in geriatric versus young insomniacs. The findings indicate that the geriatric subjects were more sensitive to the hypnotic drug, in that their sleep improved to a greater extent. However, an important loss in balance performance was also observed.", 
    "45": "We present two cases from a double-blind placebo-controlled study of diazepam in treatment of anxiety that illustrate the importance of attitudes of patients and physicians towards use of diazepam. Patient 1 exhibited symptoms of nausea, depression and increased anxiety, which both he and the research psychiatrist interpreted as a withdrawal reaction. Examination of the treatment code, however, revealed that the patient had been kept on the same dose of diazepam throughout this period and that he had maintained therapeutic plasma diazepam levels. This case illustrated a \"pseudowithdrawal reaction\" in a patient being maintained on active drug treatment. Patient 2 benefited remarkably from maintenance diazepam therapy and had manifested considerable anxiety during double-blind placebo substitution but his private physician expressed great reluctance to continue this treatment regimen because he had been influenced by unfavorable publicity. Further information on maintenance diazepam therapy and problems with withdrawal must be obtained under carefully controlled conditions.", 
    "46": "1 The sedative and antiulcer effects of chlordiazepoxide (5 to 50 mg/kg) and lorazepam (0.25 to 2.5 mg/kg) were investigated in the rat. 2 Sedation was measured by recording locomotor activity in a holeboard. Ulceration of the glandular stomach was induced by a 2 h period of restrain at 4 degrees C. 3 Acutely, both drugs produced significant sedation at all doses; high doses only (chlordiazepoxide 10 and 50 mg/kg; lorazepam 2.5 mg/kg) produced a significant reduction in ulcer formation. 4 With chronic treatment, after 5 and 10 days administration of chlordiazepoxide (50 mg/kg), tolerance to sedation was observed without a similar change in antiulcer action. 5 Cimetidine (20 mg/kg) and atropine (0.2 mg/kg) decreased ulcer formation without causing sedation. 6 The antisecretory profile of chlordiazepoxide (2 x 10(-4) M), in the rat isolated gastric mucosa, resembled that of atropine (10(-7) M) rather than cimetidine (10(-5) M). 7 These observations suggest that the antiulcer effect of benzodiazepines probably results from a combination of sedative, anxiolytic and antisecretory actions.", 
    "47": "In experiments on rats administration of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days) caused the intensification of aggressiveness. This exerted no substantial effect on stereotyped behavior. Haloperidol produced inhibitory effect both on aggressiveness and stereotypy. The GABA derivative phenybut did not change the effects of apomorphine. Administration of morphine and diazepam produced a selective inhibition of aggressiveness. In doses exerting antiaggressive effect these substances produced no substantial effect on stereotypy. This antiaggressive effect of morphine and diazepam was suppressed by nalorphine. It is suggested that the endogenous opiate system of the CNS participates in the development of the apomorphine-induced aggressiveness.", 
    "48": "Hemodynamic responses to induction of anesthesia with midazolam maleate and diazepam were compared in patients with ischemic heart disease. While breathing 100% oxygen, 10 patients (group M) received midazolam maleate, 0.2 mg/kg, and 10 patients (group D) received diazepam, 0.5 mg/kg. In addition, 10 patients (group MN) breathing 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen received midazolam, 0.2 mg/kg. Patients in group M had a small but statistically significant (p less than 0.05) decrease (vs awake control values) in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure, pulmonary arterial occluded pressure, stroke index, and left and right ventricular stroke work indices. Patients in group D experienced statistically significant decreases in systemic blood pressure. The only statistically significant differences between groups M and D occurred 5 minutes followed drug administration: heart rates were higher and systemic pressures and left ventricular stroke work indices were lower following midazolam. Hemodynamic changes following midazolam and nitrous oxide were similar to those observed in patients given midazolam and 100% oxygen. Patients in all three groups responded to endotracheal intubation with transient increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance, but the hemodynamic values spontaneously returned toward control levels within 2 to 5 minutes. Although differing somewhat, midazolam, like diazepam, provided rapid, hemodynamically stable induction of anesthesia in patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "49": "Data obtained from anxious outpatients treated with either chlordiazepoxide or diazepam (n = 533) or placebo (n = 285) were used to explore the impact of coffee/tea and cigarette consumption upon the frequency of reporting of drowsiness after 2 weeks of treatment. Strong evidence was provided that both cigarette smoking and coffee drinking affect the frequency with which drowsiness is reported by patients receiving the two benzodiazepines. However, not only the magnitude but also the direction of the impact of coffee consumption upon drowsiness depends upon the level of cigarette smoking and vice versa. For patients smoking less than or equal to 1 pack of cigarettes/day, drowsiness is reported less frequently by heavy coffee users while for patients smoking greater than 1 pack of cigarettes/day, drowsiness is reported more frequently by heavy coffee users. Similarly, for patients drinking less than or equal to 2 cups of coffee/day, drowsiness occurs less frequently among heavier smokers while for patients drinking greater than 2 cups of coffee/day, drowsiness occurs more frequently among heavier smokers. These results are consistent with reports that particular substances contained in coffee and tea and in cigarette smoke stimulate the synthesis of hepatic enzymes which metabolize both the benzodiazepines here studied and the substances which have stimulated enzyme synthesis.", 
    "50": "The therapeutic benefit of combining propranolol with diazepam over either of these drugs given alone was tested in a placebo-controlled crossover study with twenty-four chronically anxious out-patients. The combination was generally more effective than diazepam. Diazepam was more effective than placebo or propranolol. A reduction in the resting pulse rate by propranolol of more than 7.5 beats per minute resulted in a greater therapeutic response to this drug, alone and in combination. Lesser degrees of pathology responded better to treatment. Psychological factors in treatment showed themselves to be important in moderating pharmacological response. Chronically anxious patients generally derived little benefit from continued anti-anxiety treatment.", 
    "51": "The effect of diazepam 10 mg orally was investigated on lower oesophageal sphincter pressure in a random double-blind study of nine healthy volunteers. Barrier pressure decreased to a small but statistically significant extent. The reduction in barrier pressure was not related to the level of drowsiness."
