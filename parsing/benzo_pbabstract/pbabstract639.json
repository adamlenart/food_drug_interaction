    "0": "In numerous therapeutic regimens for infants it often happens that more than one drug is given. Most doctors however, do not know sufficiently if and to which extend an interaction between the different substances takes place in the human organism. Phenytoin in combination with other drugs (anticonvulsives, antibiotics etc.) demonstrates the many different mechanisms of interaction.", 
    "1": "After a discussion of the various basic problems concerning the application of psychopharmacological drugs in children and adolescents, paradoxical reactions and interactions of some psychopharmaca are considered. Stimulantia can especially cause disturbances of growth and as a paradoxial reaction the increase of hypermotoric behaviour. Neuroleptics may lead to tardive dyskinesia, to interactions with hypotensors and occasionally to epileptic seizures. As to tricyclic antidepressive it is known that they can cause interactions with hypotensors and thyroid hormones, as well as paradoxical aggressive reactions. In connection with tranquilizers paradoxical reactions as anxiety and agitation as well as the so-called paradoxical rage reaction could be observed. Combinations of antiepileptica and psychopharmaca should only be used if there is no other possibility for adequate treatment. After all, the field of indications of psychopharmacological drugs in children and adolescents seems to be rather narrow.", 
    "2": "The morning after effects of taking single doses of three hypnotic compounds were compared in a five-group design, including the three drug conditions (temazepam, flurazepam, barbiturate), placebo, and no capsule controls. Results showed a slight superiority for temazepam over barbiturate on visual-motor and reaction time tasks. On one phase of a cognitive task, the barbiturate and flurazepam groups made more errors than the control groups. Overall, the results indicate an impairment in performance for the group taking barbiturate and a smaller impairment for the flurazepam group. No detectable impairment occurred for subjects taking temazepam.", 
    "3": "An in vitro incubation system utilizing a bicarbonate-CO2 buffer system accurately predicts the in vivo red cell:plasma lithium ratio (LR). Piperazine phenothiazines produced the most marked elevations of intracellular lithium, doubling the LR when added to the system at 3 X 10(-5) M. The aminoalkyl phenothiazines and thioxanthenes were somewhat less active, while the non-phenothiazine antipsychotics, such as loxapine, haloperidol and molindone, produced only minor increases in the LR. Tricyclic antidepressants produced a 20-30% increase, while other types of antidepressants, the major neurotransmitters and their metabolites, hormones, benzodiazepines and diuretics did not show any activity. Of the antihypertensives studied, only hydralazine had an effect on the LR. The effect of fluphenazine on the intracellular lithium level was paralleled by an increase in intracellular sodium and was blocked by dipyridamole. Several important lithium-drug interactions may contribute to an increased LR and suggest caution in the interpretation of studies of the relationship between the LR and clinical aspects of the affective disorders.", 
    "4": "A prospective randomised double-blind controlled trial was carried out to evaluate the place of a single dose of triazolam, flurazepam, and placebo on the evening before an elective operation in 96 patients. Features of sleep were recorded by patients and nurses on questionnaires. Onset of sleep was delayed and duration of sleep reduced in two-thirds of patients allocated placebo compared with their normal sleep pattern. Two-thirds of these patients also complained of waking more than twice during the night. Both hypnotics significantly improved the duration and time of onset of sleep and reduced the frequency of wakening when compared with the placebo. Patients who took triazolam, however, fell asleep faster and woke less often than those who took flurazepam. Furthermore, triazolam appeared to have advantages over flurazepam before surgery. Thus giving a single dose of a hypnotic on the night before an elective operation improves the patient's sleep, and greater benefit was derived from triazolam than flurazepam.", 
    "5": "The plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured by a radioenzymatic method in 3 patients with accidental hypothermia and followed up until normal body temperature was achieved. In all 3 patients the hypothermia was accompanied by markedly elevated levels of noradrenaline, whereas adrenaline increased considerably only in one of the 3 patients. During normalization of body temperature the elevated catecholamine levels started to decrease. In 2 of the 3 patients nearly normal catecholamine levels were measured, when body temperature had normalized. In spite of the high levels of catecholamines in plasma the heart rate was strikingly low at the lowest temperature. During the increase of the lowered body temperature the heart rate increased in contrast to the decreasing catecholamine levels. The increase of the catecholamine levels in plasma in patients with accidental hypothermia can be explained either by an augmented stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system or by a decreased metabolism. On the basis of the high endogeneous catecholamine levels the use of beta-sympathomimetics appears contraindicated in case a haemodynamic insufficiency develops during the course of accidental hypothermia.", 
    "6": "Dihydrodiazepam is a diazepam prodrug, as shown by its in vitro metabolism by rat and mouse liver and brain microsomal fractions, and its displacing activity on brain diazepam binding. The mechanism of bioactivation is discussed. Stereoselectivity of metabolism and of binding to specific benzodiazepine binding sites in brain synpatosomes and serum albumin were studied.", 
    "7": "A method for the determination of amitriptyline-N-oxide, amitriptyline and nortriptyline in serum and plasma has been developed. After extraction from serum or plasma the drugs were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The detection limit was 10 ng/ml (2 ml serum or plasma actually used). The coefficient of variation for all three compounds was below 10%. Amitriptyline-N-oxide was found in rat plasma after an oral dose (10 mg/kg) of amitriptyline-N-oxide.", 
    "8": "The interaction of endogenous opiates and stress-induced eating in rats was evaluated by pharmacological manipulation. Eating induced by the tail-pinch method was inhibited by the opitate antagonist naloxone; after being repeatedly stressed over a 10-day period and then given nalozone, the rats behaved in a manner indistinguishable from the \"wet-dog\" shakes of opiate withdrawal. Thus endogenous opiates may have a role in the control of stress-related eating, a finding that may have therapeutic implications for humans.", 
    "9": "Compounds of diverse structure induce murine Friend erythroleukaemia (MEL) cell differentiation. Seeking a common property, Bernstein reported that the relationship between activity and octanol/water partition coefficients for inducers resembled that reported for anaesthetics; moreover, anaesthetics inhibited induction. Since anaesthetics were known to increase membrane fluidity, they suggested that inducers might decrease it. Reporting evidence against unitary theories of anaesthesia, Richards et al. suggested that lipophilic drugs competed, according to their individual structure, with membrane lipids for hydrophobic regions on membrane proteins. The antagonism between pairs of anaesthetics, anaesthetics and inducers and pairs of inducers, might thus be explained economically by Richards' anaesthesia model, inducers and lipophilic drugs acting by similar rather than contrary mechanisms. Lipophilic drugs should, therefore, induce differentiation. We report here that some tranquillizers do so. As reported elsewhere for classical inducers, they also block non-differentiating 3T3 cells in pre-S. These findings may have application in cancer chemotherapy.", 
    "10": "The anticonflict action of muscimol (a potent GABA receptor agonist) and its ability to potentiate the anticonflict action of the benzodiazepines was studied in rats using VOgel's procedure. Rats were injected intraventricularly with a dose of muscimol from 50 to 200 ng to study whether the anticonflict action was dose-related. The potency of a 200 ng dose of muscimol is comparable to the potency of an anticonflict dose of 0.5 mg i.v. of diazepam. THIP (a muscimol analogue with weaker intrinsic GABA-mimetic activity) is active in doses 10 times higher than muscimol. The threshold dose of diazepam (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) to elicit anticonflict action was markedly potentiated when it was injected 5 min after intraventricular muscimol (150 ng). These data support the concept that GABA receptors may be involved in the anticonflict effects of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "11": "Spontaneous locomotor activity has been studied, in three strains of mice, following the administration of morphine and chlordiazepoxide, given alone or in combination. The results demonstrate that chlordiazepoxide enhances the morphine-induced locomotor stimulation in C57/BL/6 and BALB/c mice and counteracts the depressant effect exerted by morphine in DBA/2 mice.", 
    "12": "A 6-day peroral phenobarbital treatment of beagle dogs decreased clearly and significantly the mean AUC (1252 +/- 270 ng/ml/hr) of a single peroral dose of nitrazepam (1.5 mg/kg), as a sign of enzyme induction to one third (428 +/- 37 ng/ml/hr P < 0.05) in plasma and the concentration maximum (Cmax) (301 +/- 62 ng/ml/hr) to one third (110 +/- 15 ng/ml/hr, P < 0.05), respectively. The mean Kel, 0.36 +/- 0.04, increased to 0.54 +/- 0.04 (P < 0.05), respectively. An 11-day phenobarbital treatment decreased the mean AUC of nitrazepam further to one sixth (197 +/- 41 ng/ml/hr, P < 0.01) and the Cmax to one fifth (65 +/- 10 ng/ml/hr, P < 0.01), while the mean Kel increased from 0.36 +/- 0.04 to 0.65 +/- 0.02 (P < 0.001). The 12- day peroral nitrazepam treatment showed no sign of autoinduction as a single daily dose. The mean AUC of a single nitrazepam dose of the 1st day, 1290 +/- 256 ng/ml/hr increased after the 24-day nitrazepam treatment, to 3617 +/- 202 ng/ml/hr and after the 61-day treatment to 3379 +/- 321 ng/ml/hr. The mean maximum concentration (Cmax), 343 +/- 69 ng/ml/hr, increased to 727 +/- 52 ng/ml/hr, respectively.", 
    "13": "Impressions of two different regional anesthetic techniques used in the management of 670 cases in a hand surgery unit are described. For operations at or below the wrist, subcutaneous ring anesthesia for the forearm tourniquet, together with local nerve block or local infiltrative anesthesia using Lignocaine, is very satisfactory. It is effective, simple, and safe, and it permits patient cooperation with the surgeon, who can readily evaluate motor activity because the flexor and extensor extrinsic muscles of the hand are then not paralyzed. For more extensive upper limb surgery, intravenous regional anesthesia with Bupivacaine is very effective, though toxicity might result if the tourniquet is unreliable or is released too rapidly. These effects are minimized by the intravenous infection of diazepam (5 to 10 mg) immediately prior to release the tourniquet.", 
    "14": "Diazepam and phenazepam produce a depressant action on reflex changes in the cerebral blood flow and increase the tone of cerebral vessels, induced by stimulation of the afferent fibers of A and C groups of somatic nerves. The drugs potentiate the processes of central inhibition of tonic sympathetic activity and of reflex somatosympathetic responses along with the decreased amplitude and potential frequencies on the EEC. Phenazepam exerts a more pronounced depressant effect on the nervous regulation of cerebral circulation. GABA-ergic mechanisms are suggested to participate in the action of diazepam and phenazepam on the central regulation of cerebral circulation.", 
    "15": "Effect of diazepam on the activity of the epileptic complex consisting of a number of foci created with strychnine applications to the brain cortex under conditions of intact brain and at different levels of it neuronal isolation was studied in acute and chronic experiments on cats. It was shown that in the preparations of cerveau isol\u00e9 and cortex isol\u00e9 a more rapid formation of the epileptic complex under the influence of the determinant focus, and marked generalizaiton of convulsant activity could be observed. Diazepam induced a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of convulsive discharges. There was a break in the synchronization of their appearance first in the dependent foci and then in the determinant one. The diazepam effects were seen both in the intact brain and in the preparations of cerveau isol\u00e9 and cortex isol\u00e9. These findings indicate that diazepam may exert an indirect action on the brain cortex that does not exclude the participation of other brain structures in the realization of the diazepam effect under conditions of intact brain.",

    "17": "The phototoxic reaction to chlorpromazine and other drugs is provoked by long-wave ultraviolet light (UVA). It was shown by the in vivo mouse tail technique that the reaction is enhanced by medium-wave ultraviolet light (UVB), thus demonstrating the importance of photoaugmentation in this process.", 
    "18": "The effects of caffeine (250 mg orally) on plasma free fatty acids (FFA), urinary catecholamines, and drug binding were studied in 16 normal subjects (six men, five women on oral contraceptives, and five women not on oral contraceptives). FFA doubled 1 hr after caffeine, and remained elevated for at least 4 hr. with elevation of each FFA. Urinary excretion of epinephrine and dopamine increased (p<0.05) in the first 2 hr. returning to baseline in the next 2 hr. Plasma binding of chlordiazepoxide, diaxepam, and propranolol was estimated in each of the hourly plasma samples after caffeine; there was no change in percent unbound drug in any of the samples. In vitro addition of oleic acid to plasma samples of four subjects caused a step-wise increase in percent unbound fraction of all three drugs whereas in vitro addition of caffeine did not further alter drug binding. In our study circulating plasma FFA and urinary catecholamine levels were elevated after caffeine ingestion. In spite of a rise in FFA, there was, however, no change in plasma binding of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, or propranolol.", 
    "19": "Clonazepam (CZP) was measured in the plasma of eight subjects for 48 hr after a 0.03-mg/kg oral dose. After pretreatment for 19 days with phenytoin (DPH, 4.3 mg/kg/day), plasma CZP concentrations were determined in the same subjects after another 0.03 mg/kg oral dose of CZP. The same protocol was followed in eight additional subjects using phenobarbital (PB, 1.4 mg/kg/day) instead of DPH. DPH pretreatment lowered mean plasma CZP concentration in 8 of the 12 time points. DPH pretreatment increased CZP clearance by 46% to 58% and decreased CZP half-life (t1/2) by 31%. Both changes were statistically significant. After PB pretreatment the mean plasma CZP concentration was lowered by an average of 11%, but the decrease was statistically significant for only 1 of the 12 time points. PB decreased mean CZP t1/2 by 11% and increased CZP clearance by 19% to 24%, but only the increase in clearance was statistically significant. Both DPH and PB increased CZP clearances and decreased the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves without altering the volumes of distribution. This observation is consistent with induction of CZP metabolism. The overall effect of DPH (4.3 mg/kg/day) was greater than the effect of PB (1.4 mg/kg/day). Neither the DPH or PB had a significant effect on the extent of CZP protein binding.",

    "21": "KB-509, a new derivative of benzodiazepines, increased locomotor activities of mice in doses of 8-32 mg/kg (p.o.) and a decrease occurred with higher doses. This drug was 3-6 and 1-2 times more potent than diazepam (DZP) and nitrazepam (NZP), respectively, in anticonvulsant (anti-pentylenetetrazol, bemegride, strychnine) activities, antiaggressive activity and potentiation of chlorprothixene-induced hypnosis in mice. On the other hand, KB-509 possessed similar potency to DZP and NZP in muscle relaxant activity in mice and inhibition of flexor in cats, and was markedly weaker than DZP and NZP in causing a loss of righting reflex in mice. In the spontaneous EEG activity, KB-509 induced a drowsy pattern and slightly inhibited arousal response to EEG in rabbits, as did DZP. In particular, KB-509 was more potent than DZP in suppressing the amygdala afterdischarge and had a longer duration of action. KB-509 and DZP slightly depressed body temperature, the cardio-respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract in high doses. Potentiation of spontaneous motility of the uterus and increase of urine excretion were also observed with high doses. In conclusion, KB-509 is superior to both DZP and NZP in the ratio of anticonvulsant and/or taming activities and muscle relaxant activity, and has a weak central depressant activity.", 
    "22": "The present study was an attempt to determine whether the circadian rhythm as recorded by Animex and EEG can be used as an indicator of drug dependence in rats, and also to examine the correlation between drug dependence and changes in several monoamines. Repetitive injections of morphine (MP), methamphetamine (MAPT) and cocaine (CC) markedly increased motor activity for about 4 hours post-injection, depending on the number of injections and also remarkably increased the state of wakefulness (AW), but decreased the amount of both slow wave sleep (SWS) and fast wave sleep (FWS) in the EEG sleep-wakefulness cycles during the 7-hour observation period. The injection of MP induced the dissociation between EEG and behavior. SWS increased in phenobarbital (PNB)- and diazepam (DZP)-dependent rats. Abrupt withdrawal of MP resulted in a consistent decrease in motor activity, an increase in AW, and a decrease in SWS and FWS both during the day and at night. The withdrawal of PNB and DZP produced an increase in motor activity and AW, and a decrease in SWS both during the day and at night. The circadian rhythm seen during the course of repetitive injections of MAPT and CC disappeared immediately following the withdrawal. Normal rhythm was recovered with an increase in SWS at night. Repetitive administration and subsequent abrupt withdrawal of the drugs altered the contents and turnover rates of the three monoamines.", 
    "23": "Experiments on rats trained active avoidance according to Sidman have shown that optimal correction of the operative activity disorders induced by immobilization of the animals and diazepam administration is provided by administering midantan, apomorphine, dopamine and nuredal rather than by amphetamine, sydnocarb and clonidin. The results obtained favour the administering of dopaminomimetics as correctors of psychodepressant effects of diazepam.", 
    "24": "The benzodiazepines (BZD) are widely used in clinical practice as anxiolytics, muscle relaxants, sedatives and anticonvulsants. Electrophysiological studies have shown a specific interaction of BZD with - aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, of which they enhance the physiological effects. The discovery of saturable and stereospecific binding sites with high affinity for BZD, and their brain distribution indicates a predominantly cortical action of BZD. Furthermore, BZD receptors seem to be linked to GABA receptors--modulating their inhibitory effects--and closely connected to the chloride conductance mechanism associated to the GABA receptor. The discovery of BZD receptors suggests the existence of endogenous ligands. Inosine, hypoxanthine or nicotinamide are reported to have BZD-like activities, in spite of a relative low affinity for their binding sites. Their putative role as endogenous anxiolytics needs to be supported by behavioral studies.", 
    "25": "Intravenous diazepam is an excellent anxiolytic drug for dental patients. Thrombophlebitis associated with its use has prompted this review. Recognition and management of thrombophlebitis are discussed along with the causes of vascular injury after intravenous diazepam. In two histologic studies, Graham and others thought it unlikely that precipitated crystals of diluted diazepam caused postinjection vasculopathology. It seems to be an inherent property of the vehicle or the drug itself. The reviewed methods of minimizing thrombophlebitis after intravenous diazepam are with hepari flush or saline solution flush, steroids, vein size and venipuncture site, the use of a different vehicle, dilutions, and the use of other benzodiazepines. Lorazepam, midazolam, and flunitrazepam are relatively new benzodiazepines that produce less thrombophlebitis than diazepam after injection. These newer benzodiazepines are still being investigated and more clinical trials must be done to recommend any of them as alternatives to intravenous diazepam in dentistry.", 
    "26": "In previous studies from our laboratory a positive correlation between elevated blood ketone levels and the survival time (ST) during hypoxia (4-5% oxygen) was observed in fasted and alloxan diabetic mice. To test the hypothesis that ketosis was somehow increasing the tolerance of mice to hypoxia, we induced ketosis by either oral (PO), intraperitoneal (IP), or intravenous (IV) 1,3-butanediol (BD). Blood beta-hydroxbutyrate increased from 0.33 +/- 0.06 mM to 3.32 +/- 0.08 mM for PO, 1.2 +/- 0.2 mM for IV and 0.83 +/- 0.15 mM for IP. BD was associated with an increase in ST to 458% (n = 19) when given PO, 217% (n = 12) by IP route, and 560% (n = 13) by the IV route. The effect of ambient temperature (Ta) on this phenomenon was evaluated at 12, 22, 32, and 34 degrees C. At each Ta, IV BD at 1.4 mmole/mouse was associated with an increase in ST to 525, 559, 151, and 145% of control, respectively. The absolute ST of both control and treated mice was greater at Ta of 12 and 22 degrees C. Hypoxia, however, was associated with a decrease in body temperature in each group. It is concluded that the artificial induction of ketosis by BD is associated with an increase in ST of mice exposed to hypoxia.", 
    "27": "A patient with chronic active hepatitis and membranous glomerulonephritis acquired an acute, fatal illness characterized by a toxic erythematous desquamative dermatitis with bulla formation, fever, diarrhea, and hepatic and renal failure. The cutaneous histopathologic appearance resembled that found in erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and the acute graft vs host reaction. The cutaneous eruption may have been part of a widespread atuoimmune reaction, possibly triggered by drugs or infection.", 
    "28": "Binding studies using the alkylating benzodiazepine kenazepine strongly suggest the existence of several populations of benzodiazepine receptors in the CNS. Kenazepine reacts noncompetitively and irreversibly with some receptors and competitively (reversibly) with others. Cerebellum contains the largest proportion (approx. 80%) of the noncompetitive type, while hippocampus and cortex contain a preponderance of competitive-type receptors (approx. 80 and 50%, respectively). The Hill coefficients for kenazepine are approx. 0.7 in cortex and cerebellum, and near unity in dorsal hippocampus. Different populations of benzodiazepine receptors may mediate different physiologic and pharmacologic effects in vivo.", 
    "29": "In adult male albino BALB/c mice inosine (INS, 100 and 200 micrograms, intraventricularly) prolonged the latency of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizures while nicotinamide (NAM) exerted an opposite effect. In adult male C57BL/6 mice INS decreased lethality after PTZ while NAM increased it. In adult male albino SHR (bred from Swiss) and in adult male CC57BR mice INS and NAM did not modify the effect of PTZ. Both INS and NAM administered ICB induced short-lasting locomotor excitement in albino SHR and BALB/c mice but not in C57BL/6 or CC57BR mice. Pretreatment with INS (300 mg/kg, IP) prolonged the latency of PTZ seizures only in SHR mice. Pretreatment with NAM was ineffective in all strains tested. Chronic treatment with NAM and INS (100 mg/kg, IP, daily for 5 days) in SHR mice did not modify the effect of PTZ. The data obtained emphasize the importance of the appropriate choice of mouse strain for studies on INS and NAM as puntative endogenous ligands of the BDZ receptor (BDZR). The opposite effects of INS and NAM raise doubts that these two substances could play the same or similar roles in the function of a type of BDZR which is related to the action of PTZ on the central nervous system.", 
    "30": "Aggressive behavior in the footshock induced fighting test (FIFT) was studied after treatment with benzodiazepines (diazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, medazepam) given alone or in combination with beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (propranolol, oxprenolol, practolol). With the combinations of those drugs it was found that diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) with propranolol, oxprenolol, and practolol (20 mg/kg); nitrazepam (0.25 mg/kg) with propranolol (10 mg/kg) and nitrazepam (0.1 mg/kg) with practolol (20 mg/kg); temazepam (0.5 mg/kg) with propranolol (10 mg/kg) and temazepam (1 mg/kg) with oxprenolol and practolol (20 mg/kg); medazepam (1.5 mg/kg) with propranolol (10.mg/kg) and medazepam (1 mg/kg) with practolol (20 mg/kg) produced a statistically significant decrease in frequency of fighting episodes in mice as compared with benzodiazepines alone and with control animals. The results demonstrate that beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists potentiate the antiaggressive action of benzodiazepines when given in doses which by themselves do not suppress aggression.", 
    "31": "Fifty-three geriatric patients under subarachnoid block for orthopaedic surgery received flunitrazepam 0.3-0.4 mg intravenously. Blood gases were checked while breathing room air. This dose caused a significant but small respiratory depression (p less than 0.05). These results confirm other reports on flunitrazepam, but used without spinal anaesthesia. There was no case, however, who needed ventilatory support. Top up doses up to a total of 1 mg caused no further significant changes. We feel that Flunitrazepam is a useful drug for sedation during regional block including poor risk patients.", 
    "32": "Studies of the new benzodiazepine drug phenazepam comparatively to diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam, phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin have shown that by its anticonvulsant effects phenazepam is similar to clonazepam and differs from other antiepileptic agents. Phenazepam exhibits a pronounced capacity for removing paroxysmal epileptiform discharges induced by cobalt application to the surface of the brain cortex. Prolonged administration induces tolerance to phenazepam as shown by antagonism to strychnine and by capacity for preventing convulsions in maximal electric shock.", 
    "33": "A clinical trial was designed to compare diazepam and lorazepam when administered intravenously immediately prior to third molar surgery. The two drugs were compared on three scores, patient behaviour during surgery, presence of amnesia and extent of psychomotor impairment. Within the confines of the investigation the principle difference between diazepam and lorazepam was the greater degree of psychomotor impairment induced by the latter drug two hours post-injection.", 
    "34": "It is reasonable to suggest that further understanding of the physiology and the mode of action of the drugs that are most effective in decreasing human anxiety, the BDZ, may provide important clues to the understanding of anxiety. BDZ receptors have recently been discovered in human brain where they have a differential distribution. Good correlations have been obtained between the clinical potency of a series of BDZ and the tightness with which they bind to brain membranes. It has been discovered that BDZ may exert part of their therapeutic action by enhancing the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Thus it appears that some of the actions of diazepam may be a result of increasing the ability of GABA to quiet brain cell activity. A number of endogenous compounds have been discovered that are produced in brain and that may act like BDZ, but at the present time no single candidate has convincingly emerged as the endogenous BDZ. A world-wide search for the endogenous BDZ continues. Finally, a brain structure, the nucleus locus coeruleus, has been proposed as possibly relevant to anxiety-like behavior. Electrical stimulation of this area can produce anxiety-like behavior in monkeys that can be blocked by diazepam. Thus, for the first time in many years, the above-mentioned discoveries have increased hope that significant progress will be made in our understanding of the severe and at times incapacitating mental problem of severe anxiety.", 
    "35": "1. We have stressed the detrimental effect that lay publications, T. V. and mass media has had on the pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depressive reactions with benzodiazepines. 2. We have reviewed the scientific literature and found few well documented cases of benzodiazepine dependence if one considers that benzodiazepines are the most prescribed medications. 3. We discussed the possibility that the seizures reported on withdrawal of benzodiazepines used for very long periods, is not a \"proof\" of a physical dependence, but rather clinical evidence of the well known anticonvulsant effect of benzodiazepines. 4. We have hypothesized that the withdrawal syndromes associated to high dosages of benzodiazepines might have a different neurochemical mechanism to that observed in alcohol and barbiturates withdrawals.", 
    "36": "The central nervous and cardiovascular effects of midazolam 0.15 mg kg-1 were studied in 20 healthy, unpremedicated volunteers (10 male and 10 female). No important side-effects were noted and the venous tolerance to midazolam was excellent. Three minutes after injection mean systolic arterial pressure decreased from 121 +/- (SEM) 2 mm Hg to 115 +/- (SEM) 2 mm Hg and diastolic pressure from 78 +/- 2 to 70 +/0 2 mm Hg (P < 0.05), and these effects persisted for at least 20 min. Heart rate increased from 77 +/- 4 beat min-1 to 90 +/- 3 and 88 +/- 3 beat min-1 and 3 min after the injection (P < 0.05). Anterograde amnesia (40 +/- 3 min duration) and drowsiness (lasting 128 +/- 23 min) were observed in all subjects. Loss of the eyelash reflex and apnoea were observed more often in the male group than in the female subjects. Midazolam 0.15 mg kg-1 was not sufficient to induce anaesthesia reliably in healthy unpremedicated volunteers.", 
    "37": "In a double-blind comparison with placebo the time-course of the effects of temazepam 40 mg and 20 mg on breathing, arterial pressure, oral temperature, cognitive function, psychomotor performance and subjective observations have been examined in 12 healthy volunteers. Temazepam 40 mg caused significant displacement of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide 1 h after administration and a decrease in oral temperature 2 h after administration. Deficits in cognitive function were still apparent 1.5 and 2.5 h after administration and psychomotor performance did not equal control at 3.5 h. However, most subjects felt normal 2.5-3 h afterwards. Temazepam 20 mg had significant effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance only during the 1st hour after administration.", 
    "38": "Clobazam1 is a 1,5-benzodiazepine with antianxiety and anticonvulsant properties, advocated for the treatment of primary anxiety and that associated with organic or functional disorders. Clobazam itself has a half-life of 18 hours, but that of the principal metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, is about 50 hours. Although the metabolite is pharmacologically less active than the parent drug, steady-state plasma concentrations of the metabolite are 8 times higher than those of the unchanged drug. Therapeutic trials indicate that the antianxiety effect of clobazam 30 to 80 mg daily is comparable with that of half its dose of diazepam. Clobazam has minimal muscle relaxant and hypnotic activity. Although subjective drowsiness has occurred with similar frequency with clobazam and diazepam in some studies, clobazam causes less objectively measured sedation or psychomotor impairment in experimental studies. Results of studies of vigilance and psychomotor performance during therapeutic use in patients are less conclusive, but clobazam may be useful in anxious patients who experience such impairment with other benzodiazepines.", 
    "39": "Cerebral vascular and metabolic effects of lorazepam were evaluated in ten awake monkeys by use of a modification of the Kety-Schmidt technique. Five received ketamine, 10 mg/kg, im, five to eight hours prior to the study, but all animals were otherwise treated identically. Monkeys receiving ketamine had significantly greater (P < 0.05) cerebral blood flow (CBF) values before lorazepam was given (46 +/- 1 ml/100 g/min) than did monkeys not receiving ketamine (41 +/- 1 ml/100 g/min), but in all other respects, premedicated and unpremedicated animals did not differ. Lorazepam administration did not significantly alter systemic arterial blood pressure or blood-gas values. However, it did decrease CBF by 26 per cent and increase cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) by approximately 25 per cent (P < 0.01). The cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRg) decreased 42 per cent (P < 0.05). Following lorazepam administration, the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) decreased by 21-30 per cent. When combined CMRO2 data for the two anesthetic groups are pooled, this decrease is significant (P < 0.05). This study indicates that sedative doses of lorazepam decrease cerebral blood flow and metabolism with minimal effects on blood pressure and blood-gas values. Lorazepam administration did not produce any change in cerebral metabolism indicative of brain hypoxia or ischemia.", 
    "40": "Aromatic hydroxylation and oxidation of heterocyclic molecule of phenazepame were studied. The reaction of aromatic hydroxylation prevailed in microsomes of intact animals, whereas preinduction of rats using phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene altered the phenazepame metabolism increasing the rate of oxidation in the heterocyclic ring. Kinetic parameters are described for oxidation of phenazepame molecule by both intact and induced rat microsomes.", 
    "41": "Toxic actions of flurazepam (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats. High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge. As a function of dose, FZP first protected against convulsions and death. At higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.", 
    "42": "Phenasepam was studied by the double blind method in comparison with seduxen according to the random principle in 90 males under 60 years of age suffering from ischemic heart disease with psychopathological changes. Phenasepam was given in daily doses of 1.5-4 mg for 3-4 weeks. The psychic condition became normal or considerably improved in 57.2% of patients treated with phenasepam, in 43.8% of those given placebo for phenasepam, and in 21.7% of patients treated with seduxen. Phenasepam caused the best effect in syndromes of pointless anxiety, depression, and cardiophobia. The side-effects (somnolence, listlessness, ataxia) were mild and transient. The authors conclude that it is expedient to use phenasepam in the treatment of psychopathological changes in patients with ischemic heart disease. Psychological factors influencing the therapeutic effect of drugs and its assessment are discussed.", 
    "43": "The spectrum of contemporary antiepileptics are categorically reviewed with reference to adverse behavioral sequelae. These iatrogenic disturbances may have peripheral (eg. heptatic dysfunction, blood dyscrasia, or lupus-like syndromes) or central (eg. altered neurotransmission) manifestations. Whether an idiosyncratic reaction, toxic circumstance, or untoward drug interaction, there is scant understanding of the predisposing factors or recognition of the neuropsychiatric influence of anticonvulsant therapy.", 
    "44": "Squirrel monkeys pressed a key under a two-component, 30-response fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation. In both nonpunishment and punishment components, every 30th key-pressing response resulted in food presentation. In the punishment component, the 11th and 22nd response in each 30-response fixed-ratio also produced a 200msec i.v. injection of 30 to 100 microgram/kg of histamine; this resulted in about an 80% suppression of responding in the punishment component. A second group of squirrel monkeys, with arterial catheters for monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, received automatic i.v. injections of 30 and 100 microgram/kg of histamine; key presses had no programmed consequences. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 5 to 20 min Hg and heart rate increased by 60 to 120 beats/min after each injection of histamine. As an effective punisher, histamine was functionally similar to other noxious stimuli such as electric shock. Behavior suppressed by histamine could be markedly increased by presession i.m. treatment with pentobarbital (3-5.6 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (10-30 mg/kg). Presession i.m. treatment with 1 to 3 mg/kg of the H1-receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, reversed the punishment effects of histamine but only enhanced the cardiovascular effects of histamine. In contrast, 10 to 30 mg/kg of the H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine, failed to reverse the punishment effects of histamine but markedly attenuated the cardiovascular effects of histamine. Thus, histamine's suppression of responding appeared to be an H1 effect and did not appear to be related to its effects on blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "45": "Administration of naloxazone, a hydrazone derivative of naloxone, to intact mice produces a prolonged inhibition of in vitro [3H]opiate binding lasting up to 3 days. The effect is selective since naloxazone treatment produces no changes in alpha or beta adrenergic, muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptor binding and the effects on opiate binding sites are not reproduced by non-narcotic hydrazines. Scatchard analyses of saturation experiments 24 hr after in vivo naloxazone treatment show an absence of high affinity binding sites of [3H]naloxone, [3H]dihydromorphine and 2-D-[3H]ala-met-enkephalinamide, although low affinity sites are relatively unaffected. Blockade of high affinity sites by naloxazone produces an 11-fold increase in the ED50 value for morphine analgesia at 24 hr with both tailflick and writhing assays. By contrast, naloxazone produces no change in the LD50 value for morphine. As high affinity binding returns to control levels over 3 days, ther ED50 for morphine analgesia in naloxazone-pretreated mice returns to control values. Accordingly, the analgetic, but not lethal, effects of morphine may be mediated by the high affinity subpopulation of opiate receptors.", 
    "46": "Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy without sedation by means of a small diameter (9 mm) instrument is feasible but patients often remember the procedure as unpleasant, do not wish to have it repeated, and compare it unfavourably with a barium meal. In contrast, endoscopy with a larger instrument (13 mm) after diazepam sedation is usually well tolerated and often regarded as no more uncomfortable than a barium meal. Even when a narrow instrument is used, patients still benefit from premedication with diazepam, although return to normal activity is slower because of drowsiness.", 
    "47": "The effect of diazepam on sartorius muscles of the frog was evaluated. Resting tension in sartorius muscle was not affected by diazepam (5 x 10(-5)M) but twitch tension was increased and tetanus tension decreased. The kinetics of 45Ca efflux were altered by diazepam. The calcium content of the intermediate pool was increased by diazepam (5 x 10(-6)M). When the diazepam concentration was increased (5 x 10(-5)M), the time constant of the slow pool decreased and the 45Ca content of the intermediate pool increased further. It is suggested that diazepam interferes with the calcium sequestering system of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (slow pool) and causes an increase of the calcium content of the myofibrillar space (intermediate pool).", 
    "48": "Brain benzodiazepine receptor binding was determined in two inbred strains of mice, one of which is susceptible to audiogenic seizures. Specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam was higher in the seizure-susceptible DBA/2J strain (at about 22 days of age) when compared to age-matched, seizure-resistant C57BL/6J mice. Like seizure susceptibility, the differences in benzodiazepine binding were age-related. The DBA/2J strain had higher benzodiazepine binding whether convulsed or not. In well-washed brain membrane fragments specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding was also higher in the DBA/2J strain suggesting that the difference was not due to the presence of an endogenous ligand. The higher benzodiazepine binding in the DBA/2J strain was due to a higher benzodiazepine receptor density (Bmax) in this strain. These results suggest that a disorder of the GABA/benzodiazepam receptor complex may be involved in the seizure susceptibility of the DBA/2J strain.", 
    "49": "Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in the rat neostriatum are decreased by chronic treatment with methamphetamine. GABAergic neurons could potentially interact with the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in either the neostriatum or the substantia nigra; therefore, the GABA transaminase inhibitors, amino-oxyacetic acid, gamma-acetylenic GABA and ethanolamine-O-sulfate, were evaluated for possible influences on the methamphetamine-induced decrease in TH. TH was measured by the procedure of Nagatsu et al. (1964). Methamphetamine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) was given every 6 h for 24 h. Thirty-six h after initiation of the methamphetamine treatment, neostriatal TH activity was approximately 70% of control. Concurrent administration of amino-oxyacetic acid (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or gamma-acetylenic GABA (15 mg/kg, i.p.) with methamphetamine completely blocked the TH depression. Dose-response curves were constructed for amino-oxyacetic acid and gamma-acetylenic GABA. A single intraventricular injection of ethanolamine-O-sulfate (400 micrograms/rat), 2-6 h before initiating the methamphetamine regimen, also completely blocked the TH depression. These data suggest that the striatonigral or other GABAergic systems are involved in the regulation of the functional state of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, and that enhanced GABAergic function will antagonize the effects of high doses of methamphetamine.", 
    "50": "Lorazepam, a new minor benzodiazepine tranquillizer, was given intramuscularly to 19 patients suffering from acute alcohol withdrawal. The severity of their symptoms decreased rapidly. Lorazepam appears to be useful in the management of withdrawal symptoms, and more extensive trials are recommended.", 
    "51": "Caerulein and the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8), when subcutaneously injected into mice, inhibited spontaneous rearing activity and prolonged the hexobarbotal sleeping time. These effects were resistant to naloxone. In molar terms, caerulein was 40 times (hexobarbital potentiation) or 115 times (rearing) more potent than diazepam. CCK-8 was less active than caerulein) though still superior to diazepam.", 
    "52": "Saturable, high affinity binding sites for [3H] diazepam have recently been characterized in rat brain. A significant component of this binding was determined to occur to a population of receptors which is pharmacologically similar to receptors present in mammalian brain and spinal cord. Neonatal treatment of rats with monosodium glutamate (MSG), intraocular administration of kainic acid, and the use of pink-eyed, tan-hooded (PETH) rats with a genetic retinopathy (degeneration of photoreceptor cells) suggests that these 'brain-type' receptors are highly localized on neuronal elements of the inner plexiform layer and/or ganglion cells.", 
    "53": "We report eight cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes seen in a general psychiatric hospital. These consisted of acute organic brain syndrome, grand mal convulsions and abstinence syndromes. All of the cases were using benzodiazepines in prescribed therapeutic doses. These problems appear to be more common than are generally acknowledged."
