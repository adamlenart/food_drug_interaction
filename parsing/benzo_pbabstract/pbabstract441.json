After a 100-mg oral dose of 14C-labelled girisopam to seven male subjects, the mean recovery of 14C radioactivity was 51% in urine and 33% in faeces. A high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for studying girisopam in single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. The serum extract was chromatographed on a normal-phase column using a mobile phase of hexane-ethanol-diethyl ether (66:9:25, v/v) and ultraviolet detection at 235 nm. The recovery was 60% and the detection limit was 3 ng/ml, using 1 ml of serum. After a 20-min delay, girisopam is rapidly absorbed. After reaching a mean serum level of 178 ng/ml at a mean time of 2.0 h, the serum concentration of girisopam decreased with a mean elimination half-time of 22.2 h. The metabolites were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, radio thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography. Their structures were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Their chemical structures were confirmed by comparison with synthesized reference compounds. The major urinary metabolites were 7-demethylgirisopam (I), 4'-hydroxygirisopam (II) and 4-hydroxymethyl-4-demethylgirisopam (III), which were in conjugated form, and 4-carboxy-4-demethylgirisopam (V), a compound with an open-chain structure (VII) and traces of 4-demethyl-4-oxogirisopam (VIII) and 4-hydroxymethyl-4-demethylgirisopam (III), which were in non-conjugated form. The metabolic profile in the serum consisted predominantly of the glucuronides of I, II and III. The non-conjugated metabolites were the metabolite with the open-chain structure (VII), III and V. Besides the parent compound, the faeces sample contained conjugates of I and II.", 
    "1": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection has been developed for the determination of three aminohalogenbenzophenones: 2-amino-2',5-dichlorobenzophenone, 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone and 2-amino-5-bromo-2'-fluorobenzophenone, metabolites of benzodiazepinooxazoles and other psychotropic drugs. A mobile phase of methanol-water (65:35), containing 5 mM KH2PO4 appeared to be the optimal when a 4-microns, 60-A Nova-Pak C18 column and a flow-rate of 0.75 ml/min (130 bar) were used. The temperature was optimized at 30 degrees C. The amperometric detector, equipped with glassy carbon electrode, was operated at 1.3 V versus Ag/AgCl in the DC mode. The method was applied to the determination of these compounds at two concentration levels: ppm and ppb (ng/cm3) using 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone as internal standard. The limit of determination was 750 pg/ml of biological fluid for each compound, and recoveries greater than 97% were obtained for spiked samples of urine and serum, using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges in the sample clean-up procedure.",

The antimuscarinic activity of the selective M1-blocking drug, telenzepine, was investigated on the isolated human urinary bladder, contracted with exogenous muscarinic agonists and with field stimulation. 2. Telenzepine (3 x 10(-8)-10(-5) M) concentration-dependently shifted to the right the dose-response curves of bethanechol, acetylcholine and McN-A343, and partially depressed the electrically-evoked twitch responses. 3. pA2 values of telenzepine against bethanechol and McN-A343 were very close. 4. McN-A343 did not modify twitch responses elicited by field stimulation up to 10(-5) M. 5. The lack of muscarinic M1 receptors in human detrusor muscle is confirmed.", 
    "3": "In this review, the main characteristics of genetic models of absence epilepsy, in particular with respect to WAG/Rij rats, are presented. Genetic models are important and relevant, since evidence exists that these models mimic spontaneously occurring human epilepsy more than models in which epilepsy is artificially induced. Genetic models can be divided into models in which seizures are elicited and into those in which epilepsy appears without any sensory stimulation. The majority of genetic models show that absence type of epilepsy; during the last few years, we and others have noticed that rats of various strains exhibit spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges in the EEG. Among the strains highly affected is the WAG/Rij strain, which is a fully inbred strain. Individuals are homozygous and because of this property, genetic studies are meaningful. Electrophysiological studies have indicated that abnormal discharges in the cortical EEG are generalized and that the hippocampus is not involved. Parts of the thalamus, together with the thalamic reticular nucleus, apparently act as a pacemaker for the abnormal discharges. There is a circadian modulation in the number of spike-wave discharges. Discharges mainly occur during intermediate levels of vigilance such as passive wakefulness and light slow-wave sleep and at transitions of sleep states. Pharmacological studies with clinically effective antiepileptic drugs have shown a close agreement in seizure response between man and rat. Studies with new compounds have emphasized the role of the GABAergic and glutamatergic system in this type of epilepsy. Particularly striking is the role of the GABAergic system. GABA agonists enhance and GABA antagonists reduce the occurrence of spike-wave discharges, which deviates from the effects of GABAergic drugs in non-convulsive epilepsy. Even more striking is the role of the benzodiazepines, generally seen as GABA agonists; these drugs do not act as such in absence epilepsy since they reduce spike-wave discharges. Also good evidence for an involvement of other neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, dopamine and opioid peptides exists in absence epilepsy. Genetic data obtained from the WAG/Rij model for absence epilepsy show a relatively simple pattern of inheritance with one gene determining whether an individual is epileptic or not, and with other genes regulating the number and duration of seizures. This is in good agreement with the more restricted human data. Cognitive studies have shown two important features of epilepsy in the WAG/Rij strain: modulation of the number of spike-wave discharges by mental or physical activity and on the other hand, the disruption of cognitive activity by spike-wave discharges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The effects of various procedures which modify consciousness were studied on the extracellular concentration of ascorbic acid (AA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5HIAA) in rat striatum, as measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with electrically pretreated carbon fibre micro-electrodes (CFE). Recovery from anaesthesia (produced by 500 mg/kg i.p. chloral hydrate) was accompanied by a six-fold increase in extracellular striatal AA levels, while negligible changes in DOPAC and 5HIAA occurred. Following complete recovery from anaesthesia, the animals were re-injected with the same dose of anaesthetic which specifically reduced AA levels by 90% (DOPAC levels were unchanged and 5HIAA concentrations slightly reduced). In conscious rats, the neuroleptic haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p., n = 5) and the minor tranquillizer diazepam (10 mg/kg i.p., n = 5), both considered as behaviourally depressant drugs, reduced extracellular AA levels to 50% of controls. The psychomotor stimulant D-amphetamine (1 mg/kg i.p., n = 5) increased AA levels by 90% over controls. Stress activation of animals (handling for 10 min, n = 10) also produced a transient, significant increase (180% of control values) in this striatal parameter. Taken together with previous reports, our results suggest a close relationship between the state of consciousness and extracellular AA levels in the rat striatum and that this relationship appears to be more correlated to AA as no such clear interdependence was noted between the levels of consciousness and extracellular striatal DOPAC or 5HIAA.", 
    "5": "The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is potently inhibited by a structurally diverse group of nonnucleoside compounds. These include pyridinone derivatives, tetrahydroimadazo[4,5,1-j,k][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione, and BI-RG-587 (nevirapine). The compounds act noncompetitively, by an unknown mechanism, with respect to template-primer and nucleotide substrates. Despite a high degree of similarity between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs, the HIV-2 enzyme is totally insensitive to these inhibitors. Using a novel method for joining DNA sequences, we have exploited this difference between the two enzymes to identify the regions of the RT that contribute to the compounds' inhibitory activities. The relative in vitro sensitivities of HIV-1/HIV-2 chimeric and site-specific mutant enzymes were determined. Sensitivity to inhibition was largely, though not exclusively, dependent upon the RT region defined by amino acid residues 176 to 190, with specific contributions by residues 181 and 188. The region defined by residues 101 to 106 was found to functionally interact with the domain from 155 to 217. In addition, the functional equivalence of the three inhibitor groups was shown.", 
    "6": "Recently, several classes of compounds have been shown to be extremely selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in vitro. These include the tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO), 1-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)-6-(phenylthio)-thymine (HEPT), dipyridodiazepinone, pyridinone and bis(heteroaryl)piperazine derivatives. The hallmark of these new antiviral compounds is a specific interaction with reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1. They are inactive against HIV-2 and any other viruses tested. Here we describe that, in addition to the HIV-1 strains, two simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains from African green monkeys (SIVagm3 and SIVagmTYO-1) are also sensitive to the TIBO class of compounds. TIBO and HEPT derivatives block the replication of SIVagm in cell culture at micromolar concentrations. Kinetics of inhibition of SIVagm RT by TIBO are competitive with respect to the natural substrate (dGTP). Amino acid alignments and site-directed mutagenesis point to the critical role of amino acid residues Y181 and Y188 in the sensitivity of HIV-1 RT and SIVagm RT to inhibition by the TIBO derivatives. Antiviral efficacy studies with this range of compounds and using sensitive SIV strains are now feasible in monkeys.", 
    "7": "Zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent belonging to a new class of psychotropic drugs the imidazopyridines which enhance the GABAA receptor function by interacting with a specific receptor population. Zolpidem binds selectively to the Omega-1 receptor subtype and from a pharmacological point of view differs from benzodiazepines (BZD) by producing a strong sedative and hypnotic profile which predominates over the anticonvulsivant and anxiolytic activity and moreover appears practically devoid of myorelaxant properties. From a pharmacodynamic point of view, these results suggest that zolpidem facilitates more selectively than BZD, GABAA function and produces a selective hypnotic effect. Though if the role played by receptors in tolerance and dependence has not been yet fully elucidated, it could be described as an adaptative process to sustained stimulation of GABA function. Animal data obtained with zolpidem differs substantially from that of the BZD and indicates that repeated zolpidem administration may not lead to phenomena of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome after abrupt drug discontinuation. In human following oral intake, zolpidem is very rapidly (Tmax: 30-40 min) absorbed. The clearance is essentially metabolic and less than 1% is recovered in urine. The apparent plasma half-life is of 2.0-2.5 hours in most adult subjects and metabolites are totally inactive. The hypnotic activity of zolpidem and its effects on sleep architecture have been assessed in polysomnographic studies: 11 studies in 579 healthy volunteers and 12 studies in 202 insomniac patients. From all the patient studies, it emerges clearly that zolpidem at the dose of 10 mg significantly decreases sleep onset latency, the number and the duration of nocturnal awakenings, and concomitantly increases total sleep time. Furthermore, at variance with what observed with reference benzodiazepine hypnotics, zolpidem does not alter patient sleep architecture: it increases only moderately stage 2, it increases, when reduced, stages 3 and 4 (slow wave sleep) and it does not decrease REM sleep. Clinical studies conducted on more than 4,000 insomniac patients have clearly shown that at the dose of 10-20 mg, zolpidem induces from the first night a definite hypnotic effect in all types of insomnia. In elderly subjects an initial dose of 5 mg should be considered. The possible presence of residual effects during the day following administration of zolpidem has been assessed in 535 healthy volunteers and in 133 insomniac patients according to a double blind (versus placebo and/or benzodiazepine) controlled design.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Physiological sleep induction is a fragile phenomenon which may be altered by environmental factors and various somatic and psychiatric disorders. Therefore sleep induction disorder is a common component of different types of insomnia, including sleep-onset insomnia and to a lesser degree multiple awakenings insomnia and early morning awakening insomnia. The treatment of sleep induction disorders is difficult and requires a precise analysis of the disorder and its aetiological factors. Specific treatment of aetiological factors is more likely to be efficacious in the long term than pharmacological sleep induction (eg: psychiatric disorders, sleep apnea syndrome, restless leg syndrome, periodic movements in sleep, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule...) when the use of hypnotic drugs is necessary agents not altering sleep architecture are preferred. Non-pharmacological methods could be used to induce sleep because they provide a better long term efficacy: sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, biofeedback technique, psychotherapeutic techniques. Recently, some authors stress the use of treatment by restriction of time in bed and stimulus control treatment.", 
    "9": "The effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors iproniazid, nialamide and phenelzine, the neuroleptics haloperidol and thioridazine, and the benzodiazepines diazepam and clonazepam on histamine H2-receptors were assessed on rat isolated uterus. The monoamine oxidase inhibitors showed a slight non-competitive antihistamine H2 activity, while diazepam and clonazepam were devoid of any action. Haloperidol and thioridazine inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the tonic component of KCl induced contraction, while thioridazine under the same conditions exhibited a slight antihistamine H2 activity. These data show that the drugs tested are devoid of or elicited only a slight antihistamine H2 activity at high non-therapeutic concentrations.", 
    "10": "Olanzapine, 2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3-B] [1,5]benzodiazepine (LY170053), antagonized the quipazine-induced elevation of serum corticosterone concentration in rats with an ED50 value of 0.57 mg/kg i.p. LY170053 was less potent in antagonizing the pergolide-induced elevation of serum corticosterone concentration in rats, and increases in corticosterone elicited by olanzapine alone at higher doses complicated the precise estimate of an ED50 value, which was approximately 3 mg/kg. These relative potencies in blocking quipazine and pergolide effects are taken as indices of antagonism of serotonin 5HT2 and of dopamine D2 receptors, respectively. Olanzapine is more potent than clozapine in blocking 5HT2 and D2 receptors, and its ability to block these receptors supports its possible usefulness as an antipsychotic drug.", 
    "11": "Characteristics of the association of brotizolam, a thieno-triazolo diazepine derivative, to central benzodiazepine receptors were examined. Brotizolam significantly displaced the [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]beta-carboline carboxylate ethylester bindings to crude synaptic membrane from the rat brain. This agent had the highest affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebellum, and it was found to be 2.1 times that in the spinal cord. Furthermore, a low concentration of brotizolam potentiated the GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into membrane vesicles. In contrast, the bindings of [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin to 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors and [3H]ketanserin to 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors were not affected by brotizolam. The present results suggest that brotizolam may be a selective and high affinity ligand for the type I central benzodiazepine receptor. The anxiolytic and hypnotic actions of brotizolam seem to be not due to the association with 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, but due to the activation of the GABAA receptor complex. Furthermore, the present results suggest that the lower affinity of brotizolam to benzodiazepine receptors in the spinal cord than those in the cerebellum may be related to the low muscle relaxation action of this drug.", 
    "12": "Propofol is an intravenous (IV) drug recently introduced into the United States for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. In spite of extensive laboratory evaluation, it is not possible to predict all the potential side effects that might be associated with a new drug. Because malignant hyperthermia (MH) remains a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of anesthesia, all new anesthetic drugs should be considered potential triggering drugs until proven otherwise. We report the use of IV propofol for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in an MH patient and review the literature on this subject.", 
    "13": "The conditioned taste aversion (CTA) procedure has recently been described as a more rapid alternative to two-lever operant procedures in drug discrimination research. We trained different groups of rats to discriminate the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 20 mg/kg) or the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.4 mg/kg) from saline by means of the CTA procedure. The results were in agreement with findings from two-lever operant drug discrimination procedures. However, discrimination training took 40 sessions in the case of CDP and 72 sessions for 8-OH-DPAT, which is comparable to results obtained with two-lever operant procedures. Dose-response curves were determined and generalization tests were performed for different benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics. Baseline behavior deteriorated in the course of generalization and substitution testing, thus preventing further generalization testing. Our experience is that the use of the CTA procedure in drug discrimination research does not have sufficient advantages over traditionally used procedures to replace the latter.", 
    "14": "Inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by spontaneous activation of GABAA receptors were studied using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in granule cells of the adult rat (postnatal day 60+) dentate gyrus in 400-microns-thick coronal half-brain slices maintained at 34-35 degrees C. The average amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents remained constant during a given recording period (i.e. no rundown was noted). The spontaneous currents had an average conductance between 200-400 pS, were mediated by Cl- flux through GABAA receptor/channels since they reversed at the Cl- equilibrium potential and were blocked by bicuculline or picrotoxin. Their mono-exponential decay time-constants (range: 4.2-7.2 ms) were prolonged by midazolam and pentobarbital in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of midazolam was reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (RO 15-1788) which, by itself, had no effect on the decay time-constant. The decay time-constant was also dependent on membrane voltage and on temperature. A 132-mV change in membrane potential produced an e-fold prolongation of the decay while the Q10 (between 22-37 degrees C) of the decay rate was 2.1. Within a given neuron, the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic events was remarkably constant over long time-periods, though the mean frequency among different cells showed large variability. Spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents also persisted under experimental conditions such as the presence of extracellular tetrodotoxin (1 microM), Cd2+ (200 microM) or lowered extracellular Ca2+/elevated Mg2+, which effectively abolished all stimulus-evoked GABAergic neurotransmission. The frequency of tetrodotoxin-resistant miniature events was increased by elevating extracellular K+ concentration and was diminished by the GABAB receptor agonist (-)baclofen only at a dose (50 microM) which was an order of magnitude larger than that required to depress stimulus-evoked responses. These findings are consistent with different mechanisms being responsible for the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked release of GABA from interneuron terminals and also identify pre- and postsynaptic modulatory factors of the endogenous, action-potential-independent, GABAergic neurotransmission as being important determinants of the excitability level of mammalian CNS neurons.", 
    "15": "In a previous study, it was found that both the benzodiazepine hypnotic, midazolam, and the imidazopyridine hypnotic, zolpidem, which has selective affinity for a sub-population of omega (benzodiazepine, BZ) modulatory sites of GABA(A) receptors, produced similar decreases in rates of food-reinforced lever pressing in rats. However, during 10 days of repeated administration, marked tolerance developed to the depressant effect of midazolam but little tolerance developed with zolpidem. It was found in the present study that, with a within-subject design similar to that used previously, tolerance developed to the response rate-decreasing activity of the benzodiazepine, triazolam and the cyclopyrrolone, zopiclone but not to that of the triazolopyridazine, CL 218,872. In another experiment, using a between-groups design, tolerance developed to the effect of midazolam, even if the injections were not associated with daily test sessions, providing no evidence for a drug-environment interaction. The lack of tolerance to zolpidem was confirmed in two experiments. There was little indication of tolerance to the depressant effect of zolpidem, even after 19 days administration of daily doses, up to 30 mg/kg, a dose 10 times greater than that which completely suppressed responding. These results showed that the extent to which tolerance develops to the effects of drugs with affinity for omega (BZ) modulatory sites can show wide variations which may be related to differences in mechanisms of action.", 
    "16": "1. In the present work the analgesic effect of benzodiazepines (BZD) and flumazenil (FLU) using the writhing test in mice was studied. 2. Intracerebroventricular administration of BZD exhibited a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect when compared to control value. 3. Intracerebroventricular administration of FLU induced a dose-dependent antinociceptive action that was not antagonized by naloxone (NX). 4. BZD administered as subcutaneous pellets produced an antinociceptive action in the writhing test, when compared to control mice, only at relative high doses and was partially antagonized by naloxone. 5. These findings could be explained assuming that NX and/or FLU have partial agonist properties in a common receptor which mediates the antinociceptive action. 6. The antinociceptive action of BZD could be related to an increased release of adenosine, which by itself has analgesic effects.", 
    "17": "The authors achieve a review of some clinical and therapeutic features related to the use of azaspirodecanodiones (buspirones, gepirone, ipsapirone). Buspirone--the only one available--is a novel nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic that shows affinity for the serotonin 1A receptor subtype, acting as a partial agonist in the serotonergic system. This review attempts to put up to date the therapeutic studies of azaspirodecanodiones--especially buspirone--in anxiety (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder), depression abuse and dependence of substances and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Though its main indication is generalized anxiety disorder, it may be also useful in treating other disorders and multiple psychopathologies related to serotonergic system dysfunctions, such as depression or alcoholism. Other interesting feature of buspirone is its potential usefulness in anxious elderly patients and long-term therapy.", 
    "18": "The physiologcal and psychological effects of the novel imidazo-pyridine alpidem were compared with those of the benzodiazepine lorazepam in the context of a clinical trial. Twenty-three psychiatric out-patients with generalised anxiety disorder received alpidem (mean dose 112.5 mg daily) or lorazepam (mean 3.5 mg daily) in doses adjusted to clinical need under double-blind conditions. A battery of tests was performed before and after four weeks treatment. Anxiety scores improved very significantly in both groups with no subjective sedation nor other particular side-effects noted in either group. However, lorazepam reduced the EEG averaged evoked response and produced significant impairment in the reaction time and memory tests whereas alpidem had no such effects. Alpidem therefore shows promise as an effective anxiolytic devoid of the adverse psychomotor and cognitive effects often associated with the benzodiazepines.", 
    "19": "Anterograde amnesia, possibly accompanied by acute brain syndrome, is a potential side-effect of certain benzodiazepines, particularly triazolam. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that is highly effective in reversing the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepine overdose. We report a case of triazolam overdose resulting in anterograde amnesia after flumazenil administration had restored clear consciousness. The defect in memory may have been due to too little flumazenil being given or failure of memory consolidation affected by the character of triazolam during the induced lucent period. We feel that physicians should be aware of the potential occurrence of acute brain syndrome in patients with benzodiazepine overdose despite treatment with flumazenil.", 
    "20": "Benzodiazepines are the most widely prescribed class of psychotropes. The demonstration of specific, high affinity binding sites for benzodiazepines in mammalian brain has provided a basis for a radioreceptor assay (RRA) of these compounds in biological samples (fluids or tissues). The RRA permits the simultaneous measurement of the benzodiazepine molecules that bind to the receptor, providing a total estimate of all pharmacologically active forms of the drug, which is useful in drug monitoring and in the intensive care of patients. After a complete description of the methodological aspects of this technique, the results obtained in therapeutic monitoring and in toxicological analysis are reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of this method are examined.", 
    "21": "E-4424 (2-(4-[4-(4-chloro-1-pyrazolyl)butyl]-1-piperazinyl)pyrimidine) was shown to be a 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor ligand in radioligand binding assays and in an in vitro guinea pig ileum preparation had both 5-hydroxytryptamine1A antagonist and agonist effects. The antagonist/agonist ratio of E-4424 was greater than in the case of buspirone and ipsapirone. E-4424 was compared to diazepam, buspirone and ipsapirone to inhibit the behavioral response to an aversive situation in the mouse black and white test box, the rat social interaction test and a marmoset human threat test. The acute administration of E-4424 (0.0001-0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) to the mouse decreased aversion to the white area of the test box and was as effective as diazepam (0.125-1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and much more potent than buspirone (0.25-1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or ipsapirone (0.5-5.0 mg/kg, i.p.). E-4424 was also effective in enhancing rat social interaction and reducing anxiety-related behaviors in the marmoset and was again more potent than diazepam, buspirone or ipsapirone. Withdrawal from a 14-day administration of diazepam, cocaine, nicotine or alcohol exacerbated the response to the aversive situation in the mouse test. This was not observed after withdrawal from a chronic treatment with E-4424, buspirone or ipsapirone. However, E-4424 administered during drug withdrawal prevented the response caused by withdrawal from cocaine, alcohol, nicotine and diazepam: buspirone was ineffective and ipsapirone only attenuated that syndrome after alcohol withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Under the same conditions oxytocin practically did not change the general behaviour pattern of monkeys. However, steady behavioural transformations were observed under the conditions of competitive food-procuring behaviour and during the operant goal-directed reaction. Decreasing aggressiveness of dominants oxytocin in contrast to relanium had no negative effect upon their general motor activity and sensory perception. Differences in effects of the tranquilizer and the peptide were seen also at the unit activity level of the neurons.

The stressful condition resulted in a 35% increase in whole brain 3H-IPs content, mainly due to an enhancement in cerebral cortical 3H-IPs accumulation. Cerebellar and brain minus cortex levels of 3H-IPs showed no alteration in stressed animals. Among the IPs, stress induced a 102% and 92% increase in the cerebral cortical content of 3H-IP and 3H-IP2 respectively. Pretreatment of animals with diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the stress-induced 3H-IPs increase, in both the whole brain and the cerebral cortex. Diazepam administration alone did not produce changes in 3H-IPs. These results suggest that an acute stress condition stimulates in vivo the brain IPs turnover, probably because of an enhanced receptor-linked hydrolysis of phosphoinositides.", 
    "33": "The temperature dependence of binding to the type I benzodiazepine receptor in rat cerebellum was determined using [3H]Ro15-1788 and regression analysis techniques. The ligands chosen were from diverse chemical families and display different pharmacological properties. Included were the agonists flunitrazepam, CL 218,872, zolpidem and alpidem; the antagonists Ro15-1788 and propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCP); the inverse agonists ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM); and the selective muscle relaxant AHR-11797. Assays were performed at 0 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C and the K(i) at each temperature was used to construct a van't Hoff plot for each compound. The binding of all ligands, with the exception of DMCM, was enthalpy-driven. However, enthalpy alone does not determine the rank order of affinity. There was no relationship between the thermodynamic behavior of binding and the observation of agonism, antagonism or inverse agonism, indicating that activation and recognition are distinct steps in this receptor system.", 
    "34": "We have constructed recombinant baculoviruses containing cDNAs encoding either the alpha 1- or the beta 1-subunit of the bovine GABAA receptor. In Spodoptera frugiperda (IPLB-Sf-21) cells infected with recombinant virus expressing either the alpha 1- or beta 1-subunit, or in cells co-infected with both viruses, functional GABAA receptors were detected by whole-cell electrophysiological recordings. The threshold for the responses mediated by the homo-oligomeric channels (alpha- or beta-) was 2-3 x 10(-6) M GABA, and for the co-infected cells was 8 x 10(-8) M GABA, suggesting that hetero-oligomeric channels formed in these cells. All GABA-induced currents were found to be inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxin, potentiated by pentobarbital but were insensitive to benzodiazepines.", 
    "35": "The effect of alcohol dependence induced by ethanol inhalation on GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx into membrane vesicles prepared from the mouse brain has been examined. Ethanol, flunitrazepam and salsolinol induced a significant facilitation of the GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx into membrane vesicles obtained from the normal mouse brain. Ethanol inhalation induced the facilitation of GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx at 3-12 hr after the initiation of inhalation, but this facilitation returned to a normal level within 12 hr. In membrane vesicles obtained from the brain of an alcohol-dependent mouse at 7 days after the initiation of ethanol inhalation, not only was there a significant decrease of the GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx but there occurred also the disappearance of the activating effects of ethanol, flunitrazepam and salsolinol on the influx. This decrease in GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx was found to be recovered within 8 hr after the withdrawal of ethanol inhalation. On the other hand, behavioural withdrawal signs such as tonic-clonic convulsions with grimaces and heads thrown back appeared at 8 hr after the withdrawal of ethanol inhalation and continued for 8-16 hr. These results suggest that the observed functional deteriorations at cerebral GABAA receptors such as the decrease of GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx and the disappearance of the activating effects of ethanol, flunitrazepam and salsolinol on the influx may contribute to the preparation of the exhibition of ethanol withdrawal signs and/or the establishment of functional tolerance to alcohol, but are not directly related to the exhibition of alcohol withdrawal signs.", 
    "36": "In an attempt to dissociate the relative impact of psychological vs. physiological concomitants of stress on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), the influence of stressor controllability and predictability was investigated in rats. In addition, the effect of a purely psychological stressor, contextually conditioned fear, was examined. The response of the PBR in rats confronted with a naturalistic threat, a cat, was also tested. Various peripheral and CNS tissues were analyzed. Specific binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 was significantly reduced in the kidneys of subjects receiving either controllable or uncontrollable shock. Similar changes were seen in the kidneys of subjects receiving either predictable or unpredictable shock. Mean [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding in lung was reduced following both predictable and unpredictable shock, but only the reduction in the predictable shock group reached significance. Controllability appeared to protect against the stress-induced reduction in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding in lung. Contextually conditioned fear only affected PBR in the olfactory bulb, and exposure to a cat was without effect. These data suggest that the PBR responds only to potent stressors, and psychological influences on the PBR are tissue specific.", 
    "37": "Two models of perturbed cerebellar ontogenesis were obtained by a single administration of methylazoxymethanol (MAM), a potent antimitotic agent, to mouse pups either on the day of birth (MAM0 mice) or at postnatal day 5 (MAM5 mice). The alterations of the cerebellar GABAergic system were studied by measuring glutamic acid decarboxylase activity, [3H]muscimol binding sites, which are known to be concentrated in the GABAA receptors in the internal granular layer, and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites, which are more abundant in the molecular layer. The primary target of the antimitotic agent are the precursors of the glutamatergic and GABAceptive granule cells. In both models GABAergic structures, as revealed by GAD activity measurements, appear to be relatively spared, and recovery of granule cell numbers occurs during development in MAM5 mice. In MAM treated mice the number of [3H]muscimol binding sites (on a per cerebellum basis) decrease as the number of granule cells decrease, although some recovery occurred in MAM5 mice, but not in MAM0 mice. In MAM5 mice, [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites (on a per cerebellum basis) were relatively unaffected, while they were decreased significantly, but to a lesser extent than [3H]muscimol binding sites, in MAM0 animals. The more significant reduction of granule cell numbers and the cytoarchitectural disruption resultant from the more precocious application of the antimitotic appear responsible for the significant alteration and lack of recovery in MAM0 mice.", 
    "38": "In the internal granular layer of the cerebellar cortex the polysynaptic complexes called glomeruli consist mainly of homogeneous populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, both located on granule cell dendrites. A subcellular fraction enriched in glomeruli was prepared from rat cerebellum, and the distribution of GABAA and of benzodiazepine binding sites between membranes derived from this fraction (fraction G) and from a total cerebellar homogenate (fraction T) was studied. The benzodiazepine and GABA binding sites were measured by the binding of agonists [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol, respectively. The results indicate that both binding sites are present, but only slightly enriched, in the glomerular synapses. We found a muscimol/flunitrazepam binding site ratio of two, which is consistent with the enrichment of muscimol binding sites in the granular layer shown by both autoradiographic with radioactive glutamatergic ligands and in situ hybridization experiments respectively.", 
    "39": "[3H]-t-Butylbicycloorthobenzoate ([3H]TBOB), a convulsant, is known to label a binding site on the GABAA receptor complex. Bicuculline methochloride (bicuculline MCl), folic acid, pentazocine, naloxone, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE) and Ro 5-4864 have (pro)convulsive properties in vivo. In the present study, we determined the extent to which these compounds modify the binding of [3H]TBOB in the presence of IC50 amounts of GABA (5 microM) or diazepam (50 microM). We found that the GABA antagonist bicuculline MCl reversed the inhibitory effect of GABA on [3H]TBOB binding completely, as was expected. Folic acid, pentazocine and naloxone also reversed the inhibitory effect of GABA on [3H]TBOB binding. This finding is compatible with the view that the proconvulsive effects of these compounds can be credited to a reduction of GABAergic action at the GABAA receptor complex. We suggest that the reversal of GABA's inhibition of [3H]TBOB binding is a sufficient (but not a necessary) condition to predict proconvulsive (side) effects of drugs. beta CCE and Ro 5-4864 modified [3H]TBOB binding in the presence of GABA in a biphasic fashion. A unique relation between beta CCE, Ro 5-4864 and the GABAA complex might exist. Bicuculline MCl reversed the inhibitory effect of diazepam on [3H]TBOB binding only partly. beta CCE did not reverse the inhibitory effect of diazepam on [3H]TBOB binding, neither did Ro 5-4864. The presence of a GABA-independent interaction between a low affinity benzodiazepine recognition site and the TBOB site is proposed.", 
    "40": "A cDNA for the human \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) was isolated from a liver cDNA library. The 851-nucleotide probe hybridized with a approximately 1 kb mRNA in Northern blots of RNA extracted from various human tissues and cell lines. The human PBR probe was hybridized to DNA from a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel to determine that the gene maps to chromosome 22. With a regional mapping panel for chromosome 22, we localized the gene within band 22q13.31. The ligand-binding properties of the receptor expressed from the cDNA were examined in transient expression experiments and compared to the endogenous human PBR. The PBR ligand [3H]PK 11195 had high affinity for the expressed receptor in COS-1 cells, but the affinities of a pair of isoquinoline propanamide enantiomers differed remarkably in expressed and endogenous human PBR. These findings reveal that the host cell and/or post-translational modification may have an important influence on PBR function.", 
    "41": "The action of central and peripheral type benzodiazepine ligands on growth hormone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels in serum were studied in male rats. Graded doses of Ro 5-4864, that binds to the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, clonazepam, a fairly pure central type agonist and diazepam, a mixed-type agonist, were given intraperitoneally. Also a benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, FG 7142, was investigated. Clonazepam increased growth hormone levels at 0.2 mg/kg while higher doses were not active. Diazepam (5-25 mg/kg) was not effective. FG 7142 (15 mg/kg) and Ro 5-4864 (25 mg/kg) decreased growth hormone levels. Flumazenil, a central-type antagonist, reversed at least partially the effects of clonazepam and FG 7142, suggesting an effect through GABA-benzodiazepine complex. Elevation of growth hormone could be associated with anxiolysis and decrease of growth hormone with enhanced anxiety. Clonazepam (0.2-5 mg/kg) and diazepam (5-25 mg/kg) increased luteinizing hormone concentrations, but only the effects of 1 mg/kg of clonazepam and 5 mg/kg of diazepam reached statistical significance. Even FG 7142 caused a modest increase of luteinizing hormone at 5 mg/kg, but Ro 5-4864 rather decreased luteinizing hormone, although not significantly. Flumazenil (25 mg/kg) antagonized partially the effects of diazepam and clonazepam. Effects of Ro 5-4864 and FG 7142 were not modified by flumazenil or PK 11195, a peripheral-type mixed antagonist/agonist. Luteinizing hormone stimulation by benzodiazepine ligands may be a pituitary action while inhibition could be caused by the activation of the central GABAergic system. Serum follicle stimulating hormone levels were not significantly altered by central or peripheral type benzodiazepine agonists or antagonists.", 
    "42": "The in vitro and in vivo effects of alphaxalone, a steroid anesthetic, and two physiological steroids, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) and pregnenolone sulfate (PS), on GABAA receptor function were evaluated in long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice. In vitro, both alphaxalone and THDOC enhanced GABAergic inhibition as measured by [3H]FNZ binding and GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux. However, with the exception of alphaxalone potentiation of [3H]FNZ binding, which was greater in SS brain regions, LS and SS mice did not differ in their degree of enhancement. Pregnenolone sulfate produced mixed agonistic and antagonistic effects on GABAergic function, dependent upon brain region, with few differences between the lines of mice. In vivo effects of these steroids on sleep time indicated that, like other anesthetic agents, THDOC and alphaxalone induced longer sleep times in LS mice. Antagonism by PS of ethanol-induced sleep time was observed in LS mice only; however, this effect was dependent upon the dose of ethanol used and on the vehicle used to prepare the steroid. Pentobarbital-induced sleep time was not reduced by PS treatment in either line of mouse. These results demonstrate that few differences in sensitivity of the GABAergic receptor to these steroids exist between LS and SS mice. Thus, unlike the differences between LS and SS mice in GABAergic mediation of responses to ethanol and benzodiazepines, there is little genetic variability in subtypes of GABAA receptors capable of modulation by steroids in these lines of mice.", 
    "43": "A series of six liquid chromatographic methods were developed to confirm the presence of six classes of drugs of abuse in urine. The chromatographic separations were performed with a reversed-phase C8 column, except in the case of morphine, which was separated on a normal phase column. Isocratic and gradient elutions, ion pair technique, and UV detection were employed. Sample pretreatment involved the extensive application of solid-phase extractions and liquid-liquid extractions on solid supports. The specificity and sensitivity enabled the confirmation of morphine, benzoylecgonine, THC-COOH, amphetamine, and methamphetamine, six barbiturates, and nine benzodiazepines screened positive by EMIT in urine.", 
    "44": "The neuropeptide oxytocin has been implicated in the mediation of several forms of affiliative behavior including parental care, grooming, and sex behavior. Here we demonstrate that species from the genus Microtus (voles) selected for differences in social affiliation show contrasting patterns of oxytocin receptor expression in brain. By in vitro receptor autoradiography with an iodinated oxytocin analogue, specific binding to brain oxytocin receptors was observed in both the monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) and the polygamous montane vole (Microtus montanus). In the prairie vole, oxytocin receptor density was highest in the prelimbic cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, midline nuclei of the thalamus, and the lateral aspects of the amygdala. These brain areas showed little binding in the montane vole, in which oxytocin receptors were localized to the lateral septum, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and cortical nucleus of the amygdala. Similar differences in brain oxytocin receptor distribution were observed in two additional species, the monogamous pine vole (Microtus pinetorum) and the polygamous meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Receptor distributions for two other neurotransmitter systems implicated in the mediation of social behavior, benzodiazepines, and mu opioids did not show comparable species differences. Furthermore, in the montane vole, which shows little affiliative behavior except during the postpartum period, brain oxytocin receptor distribution changed within 24 hr of parturition, concurrent with the onset of maternal behavior. We suggest that variable expression of the oxytocin receptor in brain may be an important mechanism in evolution of species-typical differences in social bonding and affiliative behavior.", 
    "45": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and the site of action of a number of important pharmacological agents including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and ethanol. The gamma 1 and gamma 2 subunits have been shown to be important in mediating responses to benzodiazepines, and a splicing variant of the gamma 2 subunit, gamma 2L, has been shown to be necessary for ethanol actions on the receptor, raising the possibility that the gamma 2 gene may be involved in human genetic predisposition to the development of alcoholism. We have assigned the human genes encoding the gamma 1 and gamma 2 subunits of the GABAA receptor to chromosomes 4 and 5, respectively, by PCR amplification of human-specific products from human-hamster somatic cell hybrid DNAs. Using panels of chromosome-specific natural deletion hybrids, we have further localized the gamma 1 gene (GABRG1) to 4p14-q21.1 and the gamma 2 gene (GABRG2) to 5q31.1-q33.2. These data indicate that the gamma 1 gene may be clustered together with the previously mapped alpha 2 and beta 1 genes on chromosome 4 and that the gamma 2 gene may be close to the previously localized alpha 1 gene on chromosome 5. To further examine the latter possibility the alpha 1 gene was mapped using the chromosome 5 deletion hybrids and shown to be within the same region as the gamma 2 gene, 5q31.1-q33.2. A PCR-based screening strategy was used to isolate a 450-kilobase human genomic yeast artificial chromosome clone containing both the alpha 1 and gamma 2 genes. Pulsed-field gel restriction mapping of the yeast artificial chromosome indicates that the two genes are within 200 kilobases of each other. The data presented here provide further evidence for the nonrandom organization of the human genome by demonstrating that members of the GABAA receptor gene family often occur in small gene clusters widely distributed in the genome.", 
    "46": "Seventy-five ASA Grades I-III patients (18-85 years, 45-90 kg) were randomized into five groups. All patients received N2O/O2 (2/1) and alfentanil: loading dose (LD) 0.015 mg kg-1 and maintenance dose (MD) 0.045 mg kg-1 h-1 (groups 1-4). Group 1 received propofol (LD 2 mg kg-1 and MD 6 mg kg-1 h-1); Group 2 etomidate (LD 0.3 mg kg-1 and MD 0.6 mg kg-1 h-1); Group 3 midazolam (LD 0.2 mg kg-1 and MD 0.120 mg kg-1 h-1); Group 4 methohexitone (LD 1.5 mg kg-1 and MD 4 mg kg-1 h-1); Group 5 dehydrobenzperidol 0.05-0.23 mg kg-1 and alfentanil (LD 0.100 mg kg-1 and MD 0.060 mg kg-1 h-1). The neuromuscular block induced by pipecuronium (50 micrograms kg-1) was evaluated. No statistically significant differences were found between the five groups as concerned degree of block (expressed as % twitch amplitude in response to the first of the TOF stimuli (Ta1) at intubation, T1 minimum and recovery to Ta1 = 20%, 25% and 75%. Slightly faster intubation was possible when midazolam was used in comparison with propofol, methohexitone or NLA and when etomidate was used in comparison with propofol. A wide range of individual values of maximal neuromuscular blocking activity was found.", 
    "47": "Distribution of the enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site (omega 3 site) was studied by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]L-deprenyl and [3H]PK 11195, two tentative glial markers, as ligands. Sclerotic hippocampus from seven patients who had had anterotemporal lobe resection because of intractable complex partial epilepsy were investigated and compared with postmortem hippocampus from three nonepileptic controls. A significantly higher degree of L-deprenyl and PK 11195 binding was observed in the epileptic cases. The increased binding of both ligands correlated to extent of neuronal loss, but only PK 11195 showed correlation to degree of gliosis. We concluded that both ligands could provide useful markers for quantitating the degree of gliosis in pathologic states such as epilepsy. They may be applicable in future in vivo studies with positron emission tomography (PET).", 
    "48": "In the present study in vitro interactions of disulfiram (an agent used to induce ethanol intolerance in alcoholics), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), and metronidazole with central benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) and peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors (PBR) were investigated in rat tissues. Disulfiram displaced specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 from PBR in the cerebral cortex with an IC50 value of 5 x 10(-7) M. The binding of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 to PBR in the kidney was displaced by disulfiram with IC50 values of 7 x 10(-7) and 2 x 10(-7) M, respectively. DDC displaced [3H]PK 11195 binding to kidney membranes with an IC50 value of 5 x 10(-5) M. Binding of [3H] flunitrazepam to CBR in the cerebral cortex was not affected by either disulfiram or DDC. Metronidazole (up to 10(-4) M), a disulfiram congener, did not affect [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) and [3H] PK 11195 binding to CBR and PBR, respectively. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PK 11195 binding to kidney membranes, performed in the absence or presence of 7 x 10(-7) M disulfiram, decreased ligand affinity without influencing the maximal number of binding sites, suggesting a competitive inhibition. Beta-Mercaptoethanol (2 x 10(-2) M), which blocks the inhibitory activity of disulfiram and DDC at the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, did not affect the inhibitory potency of disulfiram at the kidney PBR. Removal of disulfiram from kidney by repeated washing with Tris-HCl buffer resulted in the restoration of binding properties to control values, suggesting reversibility of disulfiram binding to PBR.", 
    "49": "The potency and efficacy of selective gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) agonists (GABA, muscimol, isoguvacine and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]-pyridin-3-ol), the GABAB agonist, baclofen, and the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, were examined using extracellular recording techniques in in vitro hippocampal slices from rats sacrificed 2 days after 1 week of flurazepam treatment. Population spikes elicited by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals were recorded in the CA1 pyramidal cell region with NaCl-containing glass micropipettes. GABA agonists were superfused in increasing concentrations for 5 min. Drug responses, averaged over the last 2 min for each concentration, were compared to the predrug base line. GABAA agonists, but not baclofen, showed a significant, 2-fold, decrease in potency, but not efficacy, to reduce CA1-evoked responses in treated vs. control slices. The benzodiazepine effect was evaluated by the shift in the isoguvacine dose-response curve in the absence, then presence, of diazepam. A reduction in diazepam potency was demonstrated in vitro by a significantly reduced shift in the isoguvacine curve by 300 nM, but not 1 microM, diazepam after chronic but not acute in vivo pretreatment. The results indicated a selective GABAA agonist subsensitivity and diazepam tolerance in hippocampus after 1 week of flurazepam treatment and establish the hippocampal slice preparation as a valuable substrate for investigating synaptic mechanisms of benzodiazepine tolerance.", 
    "50": "The anticonflict effects of ethanol, diazepam and pentobarbital were evaluated in adult rats fed a low protein diet during the perinatal period in the plus-maze test, after single injections and following chronic ethanol administration (1 g.kg-1.d-1 for 30 d). Reactivity to the anticonflict effect of these drugs was similar in control and protein-deprived rats after acute treatment. After chronic ethanol administration, control rats showed tolerance to ethanol and cross-tolerance (i.e., lower reactivity) to the anxiolytic effect of diazepam and pentobarbital. Conversely, protein-deprived rats showed greater reactivity to ethanol and lack of cross-tolerance to diazepam and pentobarbital following chronic ethanol treatment. A significantly greater density of cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors subtype A (GABA-A) was detected in protein-deprived rats after chronic ethanol administration compared with the density after chronic saline treatment, whereas no differences were observed in nourished controls. This suggests that the greater anxiolytic activity detected in protein-deprived rats may correlate with higher GABA-A receptor density.", 
    "51": "We investigated the effect of flumazenil on intravenous (IV) lidocaine-induced convulsions with and without diazepam pretreatment in rats. Wistar rats (200-250 g) were divided into four groups of seven each and were pretreated with IV diazepam or normal saline solution at 6 min and flumazenil or normal saline solution at 3 min before lidocaine infusion. The control group received normal saline solution; the diazepam group received 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam and normal saline solution; the diazepam+flumazenil group received 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam and 0.1 mg/kg of flumazenil; and the flumazenil group received normal saline solution and 0.1 mg/kg of flumazenil. After surgical preparation and recovery from anesthesia, all groups received a continuous IV infusion of lidocaine (15 mg/mL) at a rate of 4 mg.kg-1.min-1 until tonic/clonic convulsions occurred. The values of pH and blood gases were maintained within physiologic ranges. Heart rate was significantly decreased after 5 min of lidocaine infusion, but arterial blood pressure did not change until convulsions occurred in all groups. Pretreatment with diazepam alone increased both cumulative convulsant doses and plasma concentrations of lidocaine at the onset of convulsions. Flumazenil reversed these effects of diazepam. Pretreatment with flumazenil alone changed neither cumulative convulsant doses nor plasma concentrations of lidocaine at the onset of convulsions. Our data show that IV flumazenil reverses the anticonvulsant property of IV diazepam against lidocaine-induced convulsions and that flumazenil itself has no effect on lidocaine-induced convulsions in rats.", 
    "52": "During a nine-month period we have treated 46 patients with status epilepticus with intravenous application of diazepam or midazolam. The initial doze od diazepam was 10 mg (rate: 2-5 mg/min) and of midazolam 15 mg (rate: 5 mg/min). Diazepam was effective in 26 and ineffective in 15 patients. Midazolam stopped status in 4 out of 7 patients. Both drugs were more effective when they were administered at the beginning of status. After the initial termination of status and recovering of consciousness, seizures returned in 10 patients (22%). In the group treated with diazepam, 4 patients had sudden apnea and 6 respiratory depression (totally 10 out of 41). In the group treated with midazolam, 3 had apnea and 2 respiratory depression (totally 5 out of 7). All patients with apnea or respiratory depression received higher doses of both drugs at the higher rates than the others. We conclude that the efficacy of the therapy is moderate while the frequency of serious complications is high. In status epilepticus, where the life of patient is in danger, drugs with such activity are of limited value.", 
    "53": "Benzodiazepine consumption has been studied in an inpatient population of a hospitalo-universitary center. The different user wards were classified by their cost or the importance of their benzodiazepine use. In a second step, the authors studied the prescription in the 6 most consumer medical wards. The most prescribed benzodiazepines were lorazepam and dipotassium clorazepate (27 and 23% respectively). In these six wards, on the day of the study, 48% of the 227 inpatients were taking benzodiazepines. Fourteen out of them were taking more than one of these drugs. In 80% of the cases, the patient was asking for the prescription. Out of the 110 inpatients found to have taken a benzodiazepine on the day of the study, 74 had already regularly used it during the years before hospital admission, mainly women (64%) and old people. Finally, out of the 227 inpatients studied, the hospitalization is a possible inducer of the benzodiazepine intake and dependence in 16% of the patients. The results are discussed against the background of other studies concerning benzodiazepine consumption.", 
    "54": "In contrast to juvenile rigid form of Huntington's disease (HD) in which myoclonus is often seen, only 5 patients with myoclonus complicating adult HD have been reported. We herein described an adult HD patient who suffered from severe action myoclonus leading to physical disability. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in Japan. The patient, a 32-year-old female with a family history of chorea, developed choreiform movements and mental changes since the age of 24. Subsequently her motor disability has been aggravated by distinctively different involuntary movements characterized by sudden, violent, continuous muscular contractions of four extremities on any attempts at movement. Examination revealed moderate dementia and chorea complicated by frequent myoclonic jerks involving upper and lower extremities in posture or during movement. A head CT scan and MRI revealed caudate atrophy. The myoclonus, as recorded by surface electromyography over the right arm consisted of 40-60 msec-synchronous semirhythmic bursts. The cortical component of SEP was enlarged and C reflex was also observed. Clonazepam (4 mg a day) was instituted with a pronounced reduction in myoclonus and a return to her previous level of daily life activity. Although myoclonic jerks are often recognized in juvenile patients with rigid form of HD, they have been considered to exert a minor influence on physical disability. By contrast, our present observation and review of literature suggest that myoclonus may lead to severe motor impairment in adult HD.",

An uncoupled effect between electron transport and ADP/O was found.", 
    "56": "The excitatory and excitotoxic actions of the endogenous excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmitter, glutamate, are mediated by activation of three common subtypes of EAA receptors: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)/quisqualate and kainate receptors. EAA neurotransmitter systems play a number of physiological roles in the regulation and organization of neural systems during development. However, excessive activation of this neurotransmitter system is also implicated in the pathophysiology of several forms of acute and chronic brain injury. In this study, the susceptibility of the developing rat brain to AMPA/quisqualate receptor mediated injury was examined at eight postnatal ages (1-90 days). The receptor agonists, AMPA (25 nmol) or quisqualate (100 nmol), were stereotaxically microinjected unilaterally into the anterior striatum. The severity of resulting brain injury was assessed 5 days later by comparison of reductions in regional cortical and striatal cross-sectional areas. Microinjection of AMPA (25 nmol) produced widespread unilateral forebrain injury in the intermediate postnatal period (days 5-28). The severity of injury resulting from microinjection of a fixed dose of AMPA (25 nmol) transiently exceeded the severity of injury in adults between PND 5-28 with peak sensitivity occurring near PND 10. At PND 1, microinjection of AMPA produced a 24.5 +/- 1.7% reduction in striatal cross-sectional area, which is similar to the response observed in adult animals, and the lesion was confined to the injection site. Susceptibility to AMPA toxicity increased 2-fold from PND 1 to PND 5. At PND 10, the age of maximal sensitivity, the excitotoxic reaction to AMPA extended throughout the entire cerebral hemisphere and the mean striatal cross-sectional area was reduced by 81.7 +/- 3.9%. With advancing postnatal age, the severity of injury progressively diminished and the lesion became confined to the injection site. The developmental pattern of sensitivity to AMPA toxicity in other brain regions differed although peak sensitivity consistently occurred near PND 10. Microinjection of quisqualate produced a developmental pattern of striatal susceptibility similar to AMPA although quisqualate was a considerable less potent neurotoxin. In additional experiments, the in vivo pharmacology of AMPA and quisqualate mediated brain injury was evaluated in a PND 7 rat model in order to determine the neurotoxic characteristics and specificity of these agonists in vivo. The severity of brain injury was assessed 5 days after intrastriatal excitotoxin injection by comparison of cerebral hemisphere weights.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "57": "In order to elucidate the role of excitatory and inhibitory transmitters within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the circadian change of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in this nucleus, the effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT), muscimol, flurazepam, pentobarbital and glutamate on uptake of 2-DG by hamster SCN were examined in hypothalamic slice preparations. 2-DG uptake in the SCN was high during the subjective day and low during the subjective night. The high uptake of 2-DG in the SCN during the daytime was inhibited by the superfusion of 8-OH-DPAT, muscimol, flurazepam and pentobarbital in a dose-dependent manner, but the low uptake of 2-DG during the night was unaffected. The low uptake during the night was significantly increased by treatment with glutamate, whereas 2-DG uptake during the day was unaffected. In contrast to the above results, 20 mM KCl and 1 microM tetrodotoxin increased and decreased 2-DG uptake during both the day and night, respectively. The present results strongly suggest that agonists of 5-HT1A receptors and GABAA-benzodiazepine-barbiturate complex receptors regulate the function of the SCN through their inhibitory action on 2-DG uptake during the day, and that glutamate also regulates SCN function through it stimulatory action on 2-DG uptake during the night.", 
    "58": "Spontaneous and electrically evoked endogenous acetylcholine release and [3H]-choline efflux from slices of guinea pig nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbM) were studied. Tetrodotoxin reduced the spontaneous endogenous release by 55%, while the Ca(2+)-free medium reduced it by about 30%. Evoked [3H]-choline efflux was Na+ and Ca2+ dependent and frequency related. Physostigmine, 30 microM, nearly halved the stimulation-evoked efflux; atropine, 0.15 microM, not only antagonized, but even reversed this effect into facilitation. Pirenzepine, 1 microM, and AFDX 116, 1 microM, were less effective than atropine, and reversed the inhibitory effect of physostigmine only when applied together. 4-DAMP, 0.01 microM, was ineffective. These findings indicate that acetylcholine release in guinea pig nbM slices is inhibited by the cooperation of muscarinic autoreceptors, possibly belonging to the M1 and M2 subclasses.", 
    "59": "Intraperitoneal administration of kainic acid (KA) into adult rats caused a profound increase in nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA and a significant reduction of NGF protein level in the hippocampus. Diazepam pretreatment suppressed both. The reduction of NGF level was apparent in the dorsal hippocampus at 2 h after KA administration, but a marked elevation of NGF protein was observed in the ventral hippocampus at 4 h. These results suggest that non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists negatively influence NGF synthesis or stimulate NGF protein degradation in the dorsal hippocampus involving the CA1 sector.", 
    "60": "The early morning hyperglycemia of diabetic patients has been commonly referred to as the \"dawn phenomenon\". Recently the nocturnal surges of growth hormone (GH) have been suggested as an important factor in the pathogenesis of the dawn phenomenon. In order to reassess the role of the nocturnal GH secretion in the dawn phenomenon, seven C-peptide negative diabetic patients were studied during 48hr-feedback control using a closed-loop insulin infusion device (Biostator). They received oral sleeping medication only on the first night (control) and sleeping medication with anticholinergic agent (pirenzepine 75mg) on the second night, and blood glucose, insulin requirements, GH and cortisol concentrations during 0000hr and 0700hr were measured. The peak of sleep-induced GH secretions was markedly suppressed by pirenzepine in comparison with the control night (19.8 +/- 3.7 vs. 3.0 +/- 1.2ng/ml; p less than 0.05). Insulin requirements during 0500hr and 0700hr were suppressed significantly by pirenzepine (3.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.2U/2hr; p less than 0.05). Insulin infusion ratio, i.e. insulin requirements during 0500hr and 0700hr divided by those during 0000hr and 0200hr, was decreased by pirenzepine (2.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.2; p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in blood glucose and cortisol concentrations whether or not the anticholinergic agent was given. In conclusion, these results have shown that an anticholinergic agent may be useful in the management of insulin-treated patients with marked dawn phenomenon.",

However, even if rarely, serious (mainly cardiorespiratory) complications still occur. In 101 patients in whom a gastroscopy had been performed, oxygen saturation before, during and after the endoscopy was investigated. A fall in saturation was seen in most of the patients but was usually minor. However, severe hypoxemia occurred in some patients, especially if premedication was used. Older patients and patients with severe anemia were particularly at risk. These results emphasize that premedication should not be used without precaution and special surveillance, especially in high risk patients. Prophylactic oxygen administration significantly diminishes the risk.", 
    "62": "Immature rats are more susceptible to clonic seizures induced by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) than mature and senile rats. Highest susceptibility to AOAA seizures was observed in 7-14-day-old rat pups. The lowest susceptibility was recorded in 10-20 month-old rats. AOAA seizures in 14-day-old rats were blocked by clonazepam and valproate, but not by phenobarbital, carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin, trimethadione or ethosuximide. Morphological analysis of brains from 14-day- and 3-month-old rats which experienced AOAA seizures did not reveal epilepsy-related damage. These observations suggest that immature rat brain is highly prone to convulsions induced by AOAA and that such convulsions are difficult to control by available antiepileptic treatment.",

Inhibition of HIV-1 RT by TSAO-T was reversible and noncompetitive with respect to dGTP as the substrate and poly(C).oligo(dG) as the template/primer. In contrast with the nonnucleoside derivatives tetrahydroimidazo-[4,5,1-jk][1,4]- benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione (TIBO) (R-82150), nevirapine (BI-RG-587) and the HEPT derivative I-HEPU-SdM, TSAO-T was not inhibitory to HIV-1 RT in the presence of other homopolymeric template/primers. It did not interfere with the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase function of HIV-1 RT, HIV-2 RT, herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA polymerase, or Taq polymerase. However, TSAO-T proved inhibitory to the HIV-1 RT reaction primed by Escherichia coli 16S/23S rRNA, irrespective of the nature of the radiolabeled 2'-deoxynucleotide 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) used. TSAO-T does not act as a DNA chain terminator. It interacts with HIV-1 RT at a nonsubstrate (dNTP)-binding site.",

They interact with the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 in a way different from that of previously studied reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors. We established an endogenous RT assay, starting from intact HIV-1 virions. This assay mimics the reverse transcription process in the HIV-infected cell more closely than RT assays with artificial templates. We investigated the inhibition of endogenous HIV-1 reverse transcription by the TIBO derivative (+)-(S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)imidazo [4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione (R-82150) in comparison with the HEPT derivative 5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(phenylthio)uracil (E-EPU) and 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate. The kinetics and characteristics of RT inhibition by TIBO in the endogenous RT assay were similar to those found previously for the exogenous RT assay (following addition of exogenous template/primer); thus, RT inhibition by TIBO was specific for HIV-1 and the extent of RT inhibition was dependent on which of the four substrates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP) was present in limited concentrations. Of the three enzymatic activities, RNA-dependent DNA polymerization was preferentially inhibited, and inhibition was not competitive with respect to the natural substrates. HIV-1 RT behaved as an allosteric enzyme, which means that positive cooperativity for binding of the substrate was observed. TIBO behaved as an allosteric inhibitor by causing a concentration-dependent decrease in this cooperativity.",

The mean number of prescriptions per patient was 8.2, and the mean cost of drug material per prescription was $13.95. Females received substantially more prescriptions than males; the difference was particularly notable for cardiovascular agents, antidepressants and benzodiazepines. In the senior population 80.8% received at least one prescription; the mean number of prescriptions per patient was 18.4. The most commonly dispensed drug for the entire study population was amoxicillin (290 prescriptions per 1000 people); triazolam was the most frequently dispensed central nervous system drug (74 prescriptions per 1000 people). Regional variation in overall drug use was remarkably small, although it increased at the drug-class level, especially for tranquillizers. The use of cardiovascular drugs was 27% to 32% higher (depending on how use was measured) per Regina resident than per Saskatoon resident. Benzodiazepines were commonly used on a long-term basis, despite recommendations to the contrary.",

    "71": "Although several m2-selective muscarinic antagonists have been described, they are not particularly potent. Thus, the development of potent m2-selective compounds remains an important goal. We now report that a bio-isoster of AQ-RA 741 is both one order of magnitude more potent and slightly more selective than previously described compounds. DIBA, a di-benzo derivative of AQ-RA 741, in which the pyridine of the tricycle is replaced with a benzene ring, had Ki values of 4, 0.3, 11 and 2 nM at m1 through m4 receptors, respectively. These values were determined in competition studies with [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) in membranes from transfected A9 L cells (m1 and m3), rat heart (m2) and NG108-15 cells (m4). AQ-RA 741 had Ki values of 34, 4, 86 and 15 nM at each of these receptors. The autoradiographic distribution of DIBA binding sites was determined by competition studies of [3H]NMS in rat brain. At low concentration, DIBA reduced [3H]NMS binding most significantly from superior colliculi, thalamus, hypothalamus, pontine nucleus, and interpeduncular nucleus, and not appreciably from caudate nucleus, cerebral cortical regions, or hippocampus, consistent with its binding to m2 receptors. These data indicate that DIBA is the most potent, m2-selective muscarinic antagonist yet described. DIBA should therefore become a useful probe in future studies of muscarinic function.",

GABA ratio and in vivo tests for the most potent compounds showed they behave as inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR). To better define the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this kind of ligand, several phenylethylamine derivatives were synthesized to evaluate their affinity to BzR. Some of these derivatives (17, 21, 24, 26, and 30) were found to exhibit high affinity (Ki = 0.51-0.085 microM) for BzR and possessed a partial agonist activity, although their chemical structure is closely related to tryptamine 2-6, tyramine 7-11, and dopamine 12-16 derivatives. A different interaction of these ligands to the receptor site is hypothesized. Moreover, all the prepared 1-methyl derivatives exhibited very low binding affinity to BzR.",

Octanoic acid was found to bind with high affinity to a primary binding site, which in turn induced an allosteric change in the region of drug binding Site II, resulting in the displacement of compounds binding there. Approximately 80% of the binding of suprofen and ketoprofen to HSA was accounted for by binding at Site II. Octanoic acid was found to also bind to a secondary site on HSA, with much lower affinity. This secondary site appeared to be the warfarin-azapropazone binding area (drug binding Site I), as both warfarin and phenylbutazone were displaced in a competitive manner by high levels of octanoic acid. The enantioselective binding to HSA exhibited by warfarin, suprofen and ketoprofen was found to be due to differential binding of the enantiomers at Site I; the primary binding site for suprofen and ketoprofen was not enantioselective.", 
    "74": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes in human and rat colon smooth muscle homogenates were characterized with [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) by ligand binding studies. [3H]NMS saturation experiments show the existence of a homogeneous population of non-interacting binding sites with similar affinity (KD values of 1.38 +/- 0.20 nM in human colon smooth muscle and 1.48 +/- 0.47 nM in rat colon smooth muscle) and with Hill slopes close to unity in both samples of tissue. However, a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in muscarinic receptor density (Bmax) is found in human colon (29.9 +/- 2.9 fmol/mg protein) compared with rat colon (17.2 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg protein). Inhibition of [3H]NMS binding by non-labelled compounds shows the following order in human colon: atropine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than pirenzepine. Whereas in rat colon the rank order obtained is atropine greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116. Atropine and pirenzepine bind to a homogeneous population of binding sites, although pirenzepine shows higher affinity to bind to the sites present in rat colon (Ki = 1.08 +/- 0.08 microM) than those in human colon (Ki = 1.74 +/- 0.02 microM) (P less than 0.05). Similarly, IC50 values obtained in AF-DX 116 competition experiments were significantly different (P less than 0.01) in human colon (IC50 = 1.69 +/- 0.37 microM) than in rat colon (IC50 = 3.78 +/- 0.75 microM). Unlike atropine and pirenzepine, the inhibition of [3H]NMS binding by AF-DX 116 did not yield a simple mass-action binding curve (nH less than 1, P less than 0.01) suggesting the presence of more than one subtype of muscarinic receptor in both species. Computer analysis of these curves with a two binding site model suggests the presence of two populations of receptor. The apparent Ki1 value for the high affinity binding site is 0.49 +/- 0.07 microM for human colon smooth muscle and 0.33 +/- 0.05 microM for rat colon smooth muscle. The apparent Ki2 for the low affinity binding site is 8.01 +/- 1.0 microM for human samples and 6.07 +/- 1.1 microM for rat samples. These values are close enough to suggest that the first subtype of muscarinic receptor may be considered cardiac (M2) and the second subtype glandular (M3). The relative densities of the receptor subtypes are significantly different for both species. Human colon samples show the major densities of subtype M2, 22.62 +/- 1.11 fmol/mg protein, this represents 75.66 +/- 3.73% of the total receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The ligands employed included [3H]muscimol for high affinity GABA agonists sites; [3H]SR 95531 for the low-affinity GABA sites; [3H]flunitrazepam for the benzodiazepine sites; and [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) for the picrotoxin site. There was no significant change between GAERS and control animals in [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]TBPS binding. However, there was significantly decreased [3H]muscimol and [3H]SR 95531 binding in the CA2 region of the hippocampus of the GAERS. This was due to a decrease in Bmax of both [3H]muscimol and [3H]SR 95531 binding in the epileptic strain.",

Scatchard analysis revealed that the reduction in [3H]Ro5-4864 binding induced by AII was due to a drop in receptor density or Bmax. The influence of AII on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is similar to that of stress.", 
    "77": "Chronic ethanol exposure alters muscimol, pentobarbital, and benzodiazepine agonist and inverse agonist effects on the function of GABA(A) receptor-gated Cl(-) channels in the central nervous system (CNS). We have recently shown that prolonged ethanol inhalation reduces the expression of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 and alpha2 subunit mRNAs in the rat cerebral cortex, with no effect on the level of alpha3 subunit transcripts, glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA levels, or poly(A)(+) RNA levels. In the present study, rats were administered alcohol by liquid diet for 2 weeks using a pair-fed design. GABA(A) receptor alpha subunit mRNA levels were quantified by Northern analysis using specific cRNA probes. GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit mRNA levels were reduced in the cerebral cortex to the same extent as previously reported following prolonged ethanol inhalation. In the cerebellum, chronic ethanol ingestion reduced the levels of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit mRNAs (4.8 and 4.4 kb) by 20-30% and increased the levels of GABA(A) receptor a6 subunit mRNA (2.7 kb) by 45%. GABA(A) receptor alpha2 and alpha3 subunit mRNAs were not detected in the cerebellum. Glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA levels as well as poly(A)(+) RNA levels were not significantly altered following chronic ethanol exposure by liquid diet. Acute ethanol administration had no effect on GABA(A) receptor a6 subunit mRNA levels. However, acute administration of both Ro15-4513 and its vehicle control altered GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit mRNA levels in the cerebellum. Since GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunits contain recognition sites for Ro15-4513, an inverse agonist, and an ethanol antagonist, the elevation in the expression of these subunits following chronic ethanol ingestion may account for increased sensitivity to inverse agonists after chronic ethanol administration and possibly contribute to the withdrawal syndrome. These data also suggest that chronic ethanol exposure regulates GABA(A) receptor gene expression by differential effects on the synthesis of specific subunits of GABA(A) receptors in the CNS.",

However there are contradictory findings on the relative importance of each nucleus.

In contrast midazolam (1.0\u00b5g) had no effect when injected into the central nucleus. These results suggest that the basolateral nucleus is one substrate mediating anxiolytic effects. However, a brief review of the literature supports the suggestion that both nuclei can be involved, but findings will depend upon the particular paradigm used.", 
    "79": "Rats in one group were trained to discriminate alprazolam (1.0mg/kg, i.p.) and in another group diazepam (3.0mg/kg, i.p.) from saline in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure. Food presentation occurred after 10 consecutive responses on the lever associated either with the training drug or with saline. Alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam and chlor diazepoxide increased responding on the drug-associated lever in a comparable dose-related manner in both groups of rats: the relative order of potency was lorazepam >/= alprazolam > diazepam >/= chlordiazepoxide. Flumazenil (10.0mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the effects of the training drugs. A range of doses of buspirone and four drugs having antidepressant properties (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, cericlamine, imipramine) then were studied in both groups of rats. All five drugs caused approximately 40% increases (group mean) in drug-appropriate responding in alprazolam-trained rats whereas only amitriptyline partially substituted for diazepam. The results indicate that alprazolam has interoceptive stimulus effects that overlap with the stimulus effects of diazepam, yet the effects of alprazolam may not be identical to those of diazepam because the antidepressant drugs and buspirone substituted partially for alprazolam but generally not for diazepam.",

Also, at 49 days of age, malnourished and control rats were sacrificed in order to evaluate the weight of brain regions. Malnourished rats had lower body and brain weights (telencephalon and brain stem) than control rats. Malnourished rats also showed less locomotor activity at the beginning of the test session, lower flinch and jump thresholds, and longer step-down latencies than control animals. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, IP) shortened step-down latency of well-nourished rats, but was ineffective in malnourished rats. These and previously reported results indicate that early protein malnutrition causes long-lasting impairment of neuronal systems underlying emotional behavior.", 
    "82": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of diazepam on the behavior of parturient ewes towards alien lambs. There is evidence that benzodiazepines cause behavioral changes during the lactation period in rats. In two independent experiments, it was found that the ewes acceptance of alien lambs significantly increased following a single injection of the benzodiazepine, diazepam, given either 1 or 12 h after parturition. In a third experiment, in which the alien lamb was not permitted to suckle during a period of 2 h after the injection, the diazepam treatment did not provoke significant differences in maternal behavior of the ewes, although in the ewes treated with diazepam, suckling clearly tended to increase. At the dose employed (20 mg), administered 1 h after birth, diazepam caused no signs of sedation as assessed in an open-field test carried out 3 h after parturition. This doesn't eliminate the possibility of diazepam having a sedative effect in the period of 2 h immediately after its administration and before the test and, in this way, facilitating suckling which could be responsible for the maternal behavior observed after this period. As diazepam gives rise to an enhanced GABAergic activity in the brain, these observations suggest that a GABAergic mechanism could also play a role in the process whereby ewes form a selective bond with their own offspring.",

    "85": "The behavioral and clinical profiles of various benzodiazepines after acute and chronic treatment are not well defined and may differ. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavioral profiles of alprazolam, bromazepam, diazepam and lorazepam in mice after single and repeated (every half-life for seven half-lives) administrations using a stimulation-sedation test (actimeter), a myorelaxation test (rotarod), and an anxiolysis test (\"four plates\"). A dose range from 0.03 to 4 mg/kg was used. A single administration of alprazolam showed stimulating and anxiolytic effects which diminished after repeated administration. Lorezapam's sedative effect diminished but its anxiolytic effect increased upon repeated administration. Except for lorazepam, the myorelaxing effect of all four drugs increased after repeated treatment. These results suggest that the behavioral profile of benzodiazepines may not be identical during acute and chronic treatment. These differences may be present in clinical treatment and warrant investigation in humans.", 
    "86": "Sedative-analgesic treatment of patients on long-term artificial ventilation aims at protection from stress related to their disease or therapy. By stabilising both the patient's vital functions and psychological state this treatment may contribute to therapeutic success. The choice of drugs depends primarily on the nature and course of the underlying disease. Midazolam and propofol are available as hypnotics for short-term sedation during the post-operative period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of both agents on cardiovascular function, cortisol production, lipometabolism, and the recovery period following 24-h sedation. METHODS. Twenty female patients (mean body weight: 72 kg, mean age: 60 years) were randomly assigned to receive either midazolam or propofol over 24 h following major abdominal surgery. Balanced anaesthesia (halothane/O2/N2O/fentanyl) was administered for the surgical procedure. Assisted ventilation was used in all patients during the post-operative sedation period. Sedation depth was maintained at III-IV on the Ramsey scale. On arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU), an initial i.v. bolus of midazolam 0.1 mg/kg or propofol 1 mg/kg was followed by a continuous infusion (midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg.h; propofol: 2 mg/kg.h). Supplementary boluses of one-half the initial dose were given if required. Post-operative analgesia was achieved with 3 mg intravenous piritramide at 2-h intervals. A 7F Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted in the pulmonary artery and haemodynamic and biochemical parameters were monitored at 4-h intervals over 24 h starting 2 h after arrival in the ICU. Catecholamines were measured by high-pressure lipid chromatography (HPLC), cortisol by radioimmunoassay, midazolam by HPLC and ultraviolet detection, and propofol by HPLC and fluorescence detection. Data were calculated as means. The statistical analysis was performed according to the Mann-Whitney test, and significance was accepted for P less than 0.05. RESULTS. On administration of the propofol bolus at the onset of sedation, a decrease in blood pressure was particularly observed in patients with masked hypovolaemia, however, this decrease was easily controlled by volume administration. Independent of the type of sedation, the haemodynamic parameters remained unchanged throughout the observation period. At all times of measurement the mean heart rate was lower in the propofol group (90/min) when compared with the midazolam group (100/min), however, this difference did not reach significance. There were also no significant differences in cardiac index at all times of measurement, although it increased in both groups within the first 12 h by 0.6 l/min.min2. In both groups this increase was associated with a reduction in peripheral resistance and an increase in rectal temperature. To achieve the desired sedation depth, midazolam was administered at a mean dosage of 0.11 mg/kg.h and propofol at 1.9 mg/kg.h. Catecholamine levels decreased in both groups within the first 8 h: after 8 h of sedation the plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline were 525 and 65 pg/ml, respectively, in the midazolam group and 327 and 51 pg/ml in the propofol group.

    "87": "Seven healthy normal male and female volunteers (19-42 years) were trained to discriminate between the benzodiazepine triazolam (0.32 mg/70 kg; e.g. drug A) and placebo (e.g. drug B). During the first four daily sessions, drug A and drug B were administered orally in capsules 60 min prior to the session on alternate days and subjects were informed of the drug label at the time of drug administration. Subsequently, drug A and drug B were administered in a randomized-block fashion and subjects identified the drug code they thought they received. Subjects were informed of the drug code post-session. Once the criterion for discrimination was met (i.e. correct drug code identification on four consecutive sessions), the dose-effect curve for triazolam (0.1-0.75 mg/70 kg) was determined. The discrimination was acquired in all subjects; triazolam (0.32 mg/70 kg) and placebo produced approximately 85-95% correct responding. During the dose-effect curve determination, triazolam produced dose-related increases in triazolam-appropriate responding and self-reported sedation and drug strength. These results indicate that a triazolam-placebo discrimination can be acquired and that the triazolam discriminative stimulus effect is related to dose and to self-reported sedation.", 
    "88": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is widely accepted as a treatment for severe depression, but is seldom used in the treatment of chronic pain even though chronic pain and depression frequently occur together. This study presents a case in which ECT relieved both severe depression and chronic pain. It seems that the recognition of depressive disorders merits more attention and that ECT as a treatment for chronic pain in patients with severe depression should be taken into consideration in cases in which other treatments have failed.", 
    "89": "Binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to mitochondrial membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex was measured after repeated (5 days) IV administration of diazepam (10 mg/kg daily) and clonazepam (2.5 mg/kg daily). The B(max) value for [3H]Ro 5-4864 was significantly reduced in rats treated with diazepam (-49%) but not in those treated with clonazepam. These findings suggest the involvement of peripheral-type binding sites in the development of rapid tolerance to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. A downregulation of [3H]Ro 5-4864 (-65%) was also observed after repeated administration of Ro 5-4864 (4 mg/kg daily), thus confirming that this compound behaves as an agonist at its own recognition sites.", 
    "90": "Eight patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (mean serum creatinine: 2.4 mg/100 ml) and 9 matched control subjects with normal renal function received a single 5-mg oral dose of nitrazepam, cleared mainly by hepatic nitroreduction. Serum nitrazepam levels were determined by gas chromatography during the 72 hours after dosage. Renal patients and controls were well-matched for age (74 vs. 63 years), height (165 vs. 164 cm), and weight (68 vs. 64 kg). Patients and control subjects did not differ significantly in nitrazepam elimination half-life (32 vs. 24 hour) or volume of distribution (4.2 vs. 3.6 liters/kg). Clearance was higher in patients than in controls (4.2 vs. 1.7 ml/min/kg), but the difference was not significant. Nitrazepam free fraction in serum was increased in renal patients (16.8 vs. 15.0% unbound, p = 0.08). After correction for individual values of free fraction, the two groups still did not differ in kinetic variables for nitrazepam. Thus, mild to moderate renal insufficiency does not alter the kinetics of nitrazepam.", 
    "91": "The efficacy and safety of alprazolam as compared to imipramine or a placebo added to weekly interpersonal psychotherapy was compared in a 6-week double-blind randomized clinical trial of 35 ambulatory elderly patients with major depression. The average maximum dosage of alprazolam was 2.2 mg and the average maximum dosage of imipramine was 97.5 mg. The findings showed a rapid onset of action of alprazolam within 1 week on symptoms of depression and anxiety. The effects for imipramine were seen later in the study. There were no serious side effects that interfered with treatment. The anticholinergic effects of imipramine were the ones that most commonly interfered with treatment. Alprazolam produced the greatest number of symptoms with discontinuation, most of which were alleviated within a week. We conclude that alprazolam may be useful as an antidepressant for the elderly. More clinical trials are needed to test its efficacy in the depressed elderly with concomitant medical problems, using plasma levels. A double-blind discontinuation study of alprazolam is needed to determine the degree of symptom return.", 
    "92": "Since some patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome ingested tryptophan along with benzodiazepines, we investigated whether demoxepam, the N-desalkylated compound of chlordiazepoxide, would influence the binding of tryptophan to hepatic nuclei. L-Tryptophan has been shown to bind (saturable, stereospecific, and of high affinity) to rat hepatic nuclei and nuclear envelopes. We report that demoxepam has an inhibitory effect on in vitro [3H]tryptophan binding to rat hepatic nuclei and has an apparent KD approximately 22 microM.", 
    "93": "Male Wistar rats (2 months old) were maintained on a nutritionally adequate diet, and diazepam was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. After 24 weeks the effects on the fatty acid composition of plasma and liver phospholipids were studied. Increased levels of palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1n-7), stearic (18:0), and oleic (18:1n-9) acids were found in plasma phospholipids. In contrast, the levels of docosapentanoic (22:5n-3) and docosahexanoic (22:6n-3; DHA) acids were drastically decreased by diazepam. A significant decrease produced by diazepam was also found in levels of DHA in liver phospholipids.", 
    "94": "We evaluated and characterized several anesthetic induction protocols used to facilitate intubation and anesthetic maintenance with isoflurane in 7 adult ostriches and 1 juvenile ostrich. Induction protocols included IV administration of zolazepam/tiletamine, IV administration of diazepam/ketamine with and without xylazine, IV administration of xylazine/ketamine, IM administration of carfentanil or xylazine/carfentanil, and mask induction with isoflurane. General anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen for various procedures, including proventriculotomy (6 birds), tibial (1 bird) or mandibular (1 bird) fracture repair, and drainage of an iatrogenic hematoma (1 bird). Heart rate and respiratory rate varied greatly among birds. The arterial blood pressure values recorded from 6 of the birds during maintenance of general anesthesia were higher than values recorded for most mammalian species, but were comparable to values reported for awake chickens and turkeys.", 
    "95": "Bolus intravenous injections of cholecystokinin (CCK) octapeptide induce a rapid rise in plasma vasopressin and a later increase in cortisol in the prepubertal pig. To determine whether these endocrine responses involve CCK-A or CCK-B receptors, this experiment investigated the effect of CCK (1 microgram/kg) in pigs (n = 7) pretreated with the CCK-A antagonist L 364718 (70 microgram/kg) or the CCK-B antagonist L 365260 (10 ng/kg and 10 micrograms/kg). The animals were prepared with jugular vein catheters and given the antagonist vehicle, L 364718, or L 365260 10 min before administration of CCK or saline. Analysis of hormone concentrations in blood samples taken 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after the second injection indicated that an abrupt rise in vasopressin, detectable within 2 min of CCK administration, occurred after vehicle or L 365260 pretreatment but not when CCK was preceded by L 364718. In contrast, the rise in plasma cortisol that was observed approximately 15 min after CCK injection was not prevented by either antagonist. Thus peripherally administered CCK induces vasopressin release by CCK-A receptor activation, in agreement with its inhibitory effect on food intake in this species. However, the effect of CCK on cortisol secretion does not appear to involve either CCK-A or CCK-B receptors."
