The effects of 2 tranquilizers, diazepam and chlorpromazine, were studied and it was found that diazepam released responding, and chlorpromazine suppressed it. Diazepam also tended to abolish colour preference, whilst chlorpromazine was effective only at the highest dose used (5.00 mg/kg). The implications of these findings, particularly in relation to the design of experiments and to the aversiveness of certain stimuli, are discussed.", 
    "1": "The actions of flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) were assessed on the sleep cycle, heart and respiratory rates and skin potential fluctuations of normal volunteers and neurotic patients with insomnia by means of all night recordings. The most conspicuous effect of flunitrazepam (2 mg p.o.) in the healthy subject's sleep cycle was an increase of the latency for the appearance of the first REM period. In the insomniacs the compounds was effective in inducing and maintaining sleep. Flunitrazepam diminished heart rates during the REM phases and significantly decreased the variability indices, this effect being more prominent in the normal subjects. Skin potential fluctuations during stages 2 and REM sleep were also decreased although tolerance developed rapidly in this connection.", 
    "2": "An open study, in which 48 patients scheduled for elective surgery received either 1,25 mg or 2,5 mg of lorazepam (orally) as a soporific the night before surgery and as premedication immediately prior to surgery, revealed that lorazepam produced a good night's rest and a desirable calm immediately prior to surgery. Vital signs remained stable throughout the operative procedure, and vomiting and other reactions were virtually absent.", 
    "3": "The clinical trial involved 31 cases, 10 in stomatology. Acupuncture may produce analgesia after simple premedication. Of 21 abdominal operations, in 5 completion of effect using local infiltration of a few millilitres of lignocaine or intravenous pentazocine was required. In 7, general anaesthesia was required to complete the operation. All patients not receiving supplementary general anaesthesia were able to eat normally as soon as they were back in bed, passed flactus the same day and had a bowel movement the next day. Ten stomatological operations may be considered to be successful. Further pursual of these trials is justified.", 
    "4": "Accidental subarachnoid injection of gallamine and its management is reported. Methods of identification of the drug in the c.s.f. are described. Early treatment should be initiated, since the drug was still identifiable in the c.s.f. after 90 min. Removal of the c.s.f. and sedation may have prevented a fatal outcome in our patient.", 
    "5": "To produce physical dependence on morphine, phenobarbital and diazepam in rats, these drugs were mixed with powder form of rat food in concentrations of 0.5 mg/g, 1 mg/g and 2 mg/g of food. One group of rats (the lower dose group) was continuously exposed for 1 week to two morphine-admixed foods with morphine to food ratios of 0.5 mg/g and 1 mg/g in a cage. The other group (the higher dose group) could choose between two morphine-admixed foods with morphine to food ratios of 1 mg/g and 2 mg/g. After 1 week, morphine-admixed foods were replaced with morphine free food for 2 days. Both groups of rats showed greatly reduced body weight and food intake after the first 24-48 hr withdrawal. The body weight decrease was greater for rats in the higher dose group. Control groups of morphine dependent rats were kept on the morphine added food diets and showed the same body weight increase as well as normal control rats during the course of these experiments. Physical dependence on phenobarbital and diazepam was produced using the same dosage schedules as with morphine. Both the lower and higher dose groups showed significant decrease in body weight due to withdrawal after 1 week of drug-food exposure. Levallorphan (0.5, 1, 3 and 5 mg/kg, s.c.) administered to morphine dependent rats had dose-dependent effects on the intensity of abstinence symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, piloerection and wet shakes phenomena), maximal decrease in body weight and duration of decreased body weight. Cross-physical dependence between phenobarbital and diazepam was demonstrated by this method.", 
    "6": "The effects of isometric exercise on the maximum amplitude of the praecordial accelerocardiogram (as represented by the DE deflection) have been compared in 6 normal subjects (group 1), 12 patients with aortic stenosis (group 2), and 16 patients with myocardial disease (group 3). Whereas the tachycardia and pressor effects of isometric exercise were identical in all three groups, the normal subjects showed a significant decrease in DE during handgrip of 10 +/- 4 per cent (P less than 0.05) as compared with the insignificant increases of 8.5 +/- 6 per cent (P greater than 0.5), and 4 +/- 3.5 per cent (P greater 0.3) observed in the patients in groups 2 and 3. This response in the normal subjects differed significantly from the responses observed in the patients in groups 2 (P less than 0.02) and 3 (P less than 0.01). Of the patients in each of groups 2 and 3, 50 per cent responded abnormally to handgrip in that they showed a significant increase in DE. In the patients with aortic stenosis this subgroup of patients differed from the remainder in that they had a higher resting cardiac index (P less than 0.05). In the patients with myocardial disease this subgroup was characterized by a significantly lower resting left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (P less than 0.02). It seems, therefore, that those patients who increase DE in response to handgrip tend to have better left ventricular function at rest than those who do not. We suggest that this may be because of increased beta adrenergic activity at rest and during isometric exercise in the subgroup who respond to handgrip with an increase in DE.", 
    "7": "Emotional rage and fear were found to destroy the differential inhibition and the short-term memory in cats. Stelazine, haloperidol, amitriptyline, imizine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepan and benactyzine prevented these disturbances. Chlorpromazine, as well as stelazine and haloperidol in high doses, enhanced these disturbances. The tranquillizers and the antidepressants normalized the higher nervous activity at a greater dose range than neuroleptics and were more preferable for the elimination of the negative consequences of the strong emotional reactions.", 
    "8": "The effect of diazepam and/or ethanol treatment of seven days on the drug metabolizing enzymes in rat liver microsomes was studied. Diazepam decreased the metabolism rate of 3,4-benzpyrene by 38% and that of p-nitrobenzoic acid by 15%. Ethanol increased the metabolism rate of N-methylaniline by 15% and decreased the reduction of p-nitrobbenzoic acid by 48%. Although diazepam alone had no inducing effect, its use with ethanol increased the cytochrome P-450 content (56%) and the rate of metabolism of N-methylaniline (44%) more than ethanol alone. The rate of metabolism of diazepam was not affected by any treatment.", 
    "9": "The effect of diazepam on presynaptic inhibition in man has been examined in 5 patients with complete spinal transections and 7 patients with incomplete lesions. The inhibition of the H reflex by vibration applied to the tendo Achilles was used to assess presynaptic inhibition of the Ia monosynaptic pathway. Diazepam increased this inhibition in the patients with incomplete lesions, but had no significant effect on the inhibition in the patients with complete spinal transections. Evidently diazepam can enhance presynaptic inhibition in man. The effect, however, cannot be demonstrated in patients with longstanding complete spinal lesions possibly because of some alteration in the segmental presynaptic inhibitory mechanism in this group.", 
    "10": "The results of a prospective study of 3,500 Anaesthetics for electroconvulsive therapy is presented. Minimal differences were observed between thiopentone and methohexitone. Propanidid and Diazepam were found to be unsuitable induction agents. Other findings included minimal serum potassium elevation and a low incidence of post treatment muscle pains. The place of the single-handed operator and the place of unmodified electroconvulsive therapy is questioned as being unacceptable practice.", 
    "11": "Rivotril is extracted from blood into an organic solvent mixture, Mogadon, (Nitrazepam) is used as internal standard. The drugs are then back-extracted into acid which is heated to produce the corresponding benzophenones. These are extracted into benzene and separated by gas liquid chromatography with electron capture detection.", 
    "12": "Three rats were exposed to a variable-interval (VI) schedule of food reinforcement and three were exposed to the same VI schedule but with the added constraint that reinforcement could follow only a response which occurred at least 5 seconds after the preceding response. The rats exposed to this pacing requirement responded at considerably lower rates, but obtained only slightly fewer reinforcers than those exposed to the simple VI schedule. The effects of d-amphetamine were found to be dependent on the schedule which maintained behavior. This drug produced a dose-related decrease in rates of responding maintained by the unpaced VI schedule but a dose-related increase in the much lower rates maintained by the paced VI schedule. The effects of chlordiazepoxide were not so clearly schedule-dependent although there were some differences between the effects of this drug on responding maintained by the two schedules. These results support the view that the effects of d-amphetamine depend critically on the rate of the response under investigation, but this does not appear to be the case for chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "13": "Gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer/computer systems can be used to quantify a wide variety of compounds of clinical interest. A quadrupole instrument operated in the chemical ionization (Cl) mode was used in these studies. Because of the sensitivity and specificity of selective ion detection, it is possible to make measurements routinely in the nanogram to picogram range, with 0.1-1.0 ml samples of plasma and 1-5 ml samples or urine. Internal standards, preferably stable-isotope-labeled compounds, were added to the biological samples before isolation was begun. We describe clinical applications of these procedures to problems in toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and perinatal pharmacology.", 
    "14": "This report discusses characteristics of a custom-designed vidicon spectrometer and evaluates its applicability to several clinical analysis problems. Data show that the vidicon detector response is linear with intensity over about four orders of magnitude and that the uncertainty in absorbance measurements can approach 0.001 absorbance units in the range from 0 to 2 absorbance units. Applications include the enzymatic determination of glucose, the determination of lactate dehydrogenase, and determinations of barbital, chlordiazepoxide, and glutethimide. Capabilities of the instrument system for first-derivative spectroscopy are also discussed. The discussion included a critical evaluation of the potential advantages and limitations of the concept.", 
    "15": "The authors compared the effects of chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, and placebo on hostility, as an inner motivational or arousal state, in moderately and highly anxious male research volunteers. The data again supported the hypothesis that clordiazepoxide-induced increases in motivational hostility are more frequent and intense than those associated with placebo and oxazepum. The data also suggest that oxazepam may be a more specific \"hostility tranquilizer\" than other benzodiazepines.", 
    "16": "The absorption of diazepam 10 mg after oral administration and intramuscular administration into the vastus lateralis muscle or the deltoid muscle was compared in a double-blind cross-over study in eight healthy subjects. Serum diazepam concentrations were measured, and the presence of tiredness was noted 20, 40, 60, 90 and 150 min after the drug administration. Peak concentrations in serum were 209+/-49, 152+/-60 and 143+/-62 ng/ml ((means+/-SD) at 90, 60 and 60 min after oral, shoulder and thigh administration respectively. Absorption was more rapid after intramuscular than after oral administration, serum mean diazepam concentrations at 20 min after oral administration being only 26% of those after shoulder administration. The rapid rate of absorption from the shoulder was associated with a more rapid feeling of tiredness and a greater sedative effect than after oral or thigh administration. There was no evidence that diazepam induced its own metabolism after one or two administrations. The results suggest that, if rapid preanaesthetic medication with diazepam is needed, shoulder administration might be superior to oral or thigh administration.", 
    "17": "The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) of physically and mentally healthy male subjects was recorded before as well as 4 hours after administration of one single dose of placebo, cyproterone acetate (an antiandrogen), and mesterolone (an androgen). Quantitative evaluation of drug-induced changes in SEP latencies and amplitudes, which, when plotted in terms of t-values, result in the so-called \"SEP profiles\", did not demonstrate any significant alterations after placebo. Contrary to this, cyproterone acetate induced systematic and significant changes characterized by a latency increase in the early peaks and latency decrease in the late peaks of the SEP. Apart from the non-significant amplitude changes, such alterations were previously described by us as typical for drugs of the anxiolytic class. Mesterolone on the other hand, produced a significant latency decrease in the early part and a latency increase in the late part of the evoked response which was found to be typical for the SEP profiles of tricyclic antidepressants. The amplitude did not show any systematic changes. Based on step-wise discriminant analysis of these data we could significantly differentiate both hormones from placebo as well as from each other. A comparative analysis of low and high doses did not yield any significant differences between the two levels. It was concluded that both test substances have psychoactive properties; whereas cyproterone acetate reveals anxiolytic qualities, mesterolone exhibits antidepressant ones. These findings are discussed from the clinical as well as from the neurophysiological point of view.",

    "19": "Miniature swine are useful as experimental animals for investigations involving major surgical procedures, provided that proper restraint and anesthetic methods are employed. The methods and drugs described herein are not intended to be all-inclusive but rather those found most applicable to a wide variety of studies with miniature swine at this laboratory. This report is intended primarily to guide those unfamiliar in handling miniature swine during initiation of studies with that species. For chemical restraint during minor procedures, diazepam, at a dose of 5.5-8.5 mg/kg im, has become the drug of choice. For surgical anesthesia, optimal results have been obtained using thiamylal sodium iv for induction of anesthesia and maintained by 0.5-1.5% halothane administered via an endotracheal cannula. Pentobarbital sodium may be used to produce surgical anesthesia but is generally unsatisfactory except for terminal procedures. Electroanesthesia, even with concomitant use of tranquilizing drugs, is difficult to control and results in very poor muscle relaxation.", 
    "20": "A retrospective analysis of complications arising from 300 consecutive attempts at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 278 patients was undetaken to determine the rate and severity of complications. An over-all complication rate of 5% (15 cases) was documented. Complications were categorized in terms of those arising from endoscopy itself or from the administration of pharmacological agents (7 cases), and those observed after the injection of radioopaque contrast into the biliary tree or pancreas (8 cases). Complications which might be considered coincidental to a patient's underlying illness were not excluded. Complications were significantly more frequent after injection of diseased duct systems. Brief, self-limited pancreatitis after retrograde pancreatography occurred in 5 of 90 patients with pancreatic disease. No cases of pancreatitis were observed after retrograde pancreatography in 102 patients without pancreatic disease X2 = 5.82, P less than 0.025). Sepsis occurred after retrograde cholangiography in 3 of 56 patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction. In the absence of extrahepatic obstruction, cholangiography was performed without complication in 85 cases (X2 = 3.62, P less than 0.1), although 25 of these had intense cholestasis due to hepatic parenchymal disease. This analysis provides the basis for modifications of ERCP technique and management that may reduce the future incidence of complications. This study suggests that the incidence and severity of complications that arise from ERCP compare favorably with procedures of equivalent diagnostic yield.", 
    "21": "The literature is reviewed on EEG alpha activity in different psychological states, i.e., morbid anxiety, attention and mental relaxation. In the present study, 20 male neurotic inpatients suffering from chronic moderate anxiety were assessed with respect to anxiety level and EEG alpha activity (frequency and per cent time) and fast activity. No significant EEG asymmetry was found. The average alpha per cent time was very low, most of the patients being low-alpha subjects. Anxiety and alpha index were significantly correlated. The patients were then treated with either 80 mg per day of temazepam or placebo for 2 weeks (double-blind). Significant effects were detected in the anxiety state, the drug group showing more improvement, but not in the EEG profile. The measures were expressed at this stage as change scores from the pre-treatment values and correlations between them were computed. The only correlation of significance was a negative correlation between anxiety level and alpha index found after 1 week in the drug group.",

    "23": "The effects of i.v. diazepam (0.3 mg/kg), droperidol (5 mg) and a new benzodiazepine, 5-(a-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-7-nitro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (flunitrazepam, Ro 5-4200) (0.03 mg/kg) on blood pressure and heart rate was studied in 62 healthy volunteer students. Observations were made after each drug alone, after diazepam and flunitrazepam each combined with pethidine (1 mg/kg), and after droperidol combined with fentanyl (0.2 mg). The doses of the benzodiazepines were halved in those subjects given pethidine but the dose of droperidol was the same with and without fentanyl. The blood pressure was measured by auscultation and the heart rate by counting the radial pulse. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was regularly decreased by not more than 20 and 11 mmHg, respectively. Changes in the heart rate were slight. Flunitrazepam did not have greater effects than diazepam or droperidol through the combination of flunitrazepam and pethidine seemed to induce a greater fall in systolic blood pressure than did the combination of diazepam and pethidine. None of the changes observed was clinically significant.", 
    "24": "The sedative-hypnotic effects of a new benzodiazepine, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-hydroxy-7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-(o-fluorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (SAS 643), were compared with those of flurazepam in mice and rats as well as in a double-blind clinical trial. It was found that SAS 643 has a potency 2--4 times greater than that of flurazepam while it is about one half less toxic than the latter drug. The results of the clinical trial confirm the greater activity of SAS 643 and indicate that the new benzodiazepine causes a significantly less amount of hangover than flurazepam.", 
    "25": "Minor tranquilizers have been shown to be specific inhibitors of the elevation of plasma corticosteroid levels in rats subjected to mild stress. The inability of several anxiolytic compounds to show activity at high doses prompted an investigation of the effect on corticosteroid levels of these drugs over a wider dosage range. It was found that at high doses, the drugs themselves cause an elevation of corticosteroid levels masking the blocking of the stress-induced elevations. It was discovered that upon sub-chronic administration, the drug-induced elevation diminishes while the ability to inhibit stress-induced elevation persists. Finally, an extensive dose response curve for phenobarbital demonstrated a variety of responses, depending upon the dose; an antistress effect at low dose, a relatively ineffective dose range from 50-100 mg/kg, and a corticosteroid lowering effect at anesthetic doses. The lack of effect of moderately high doses has been explained through their depressant side effects, which in themselves are stressful to the animal.", 
    "26": "An up-to-date review of drug treatment in psychoses of early childhood is presented. At the present time, of all biological interventions in these developmental disorders, drug treatment alone remains a valuable addition or an essential treatment modality of the total treatment. Experience has shown that a therapeutically effective potent drug can make the autistic child more amenable to other therapies, including special education. However, knowledge is lacking about the effect of various psychoactive agents on cognition in this patient population as well as their influence on growth, weight, endocrine systems, and organs. Drugs currently in use treat symptoms, not diseases. A great need for classification in this area persists. The same symptoms may be caused by a variety of etiologic factors, and autism may or may not be the earliest expression of childhood schizophrenia. It is suggested that clinical distinctions be correlated or even improved by certain biochemical, neuroendocrine, and physiological criteria; this also may be of considerable value in predicting whether a child can benefit from a specific drug.", 
    "27": "The respiratory effects of a new benzodiazepine, lorazepam, were compared to those of pentobarbital and pentazocine. Pentobarbital, 50 and 150 mg, produced respiratory depression, as did pentazocine, 30 mg intramuscularly. Lorazepam at 1.33 and 4 mg intramuscularly produced none.", 
    "28": "Parameters associated with the separation of antianxiety-antispasmodic agents were investigated using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Eight widely prescribed drugs were studied. The compounds were chromatographed on reversed-phase octadecyltrichlorosilane (C18) or diphenyldichlorosilane (phenyl) columns, using mixtures of absolute methanol and distilled water buffered with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, ammonium acid phosphate, or ammonium carbonate. A mixture of phenobarbital-propantheline bromide was selected to demonstrate the utility of the separation and quantification method. The mixture was chromatographed on a phenyl column, using absolute methanol-aqueous 1 percent ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (60:40) (pH 5.85) at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. Each determination can be achieved in approximately 15 min with an accuracy of 1-2 percent.", 
    "29": "A high-pressure liquid chromatographic method is described for analyzing triflubazam [1-methyl-5-phenyl-7-trifluoromethyl-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4(3H,5H)-dione] and its primary metabolites in blood and urine. Adsorption chromatography, using pellicular silica gel as the stationary phase and dioxane-isooctane as the mobile phase, permitted rapid sample analysis. After extraction of blood and urine samples with toluene, quantitation is achieved using liquid chromatography with an internal standard. The method is sensitive above 50 ng/ml of triflubazam and its known metabolites. Recoveries for all compounds from blood or urine averaged above 95 percent. The specificity of the method was established by collecting samples separated by liquid chromatography and characterizing them by mass spectrometry. Human and animal data are presented to illustrate the utility of the method.", 
    "30": "Behavior controlled by various schedules of reinforcement is useful for characterizing drugs as well as for analyzing the mechanisms of action of their effects on behavior. Conditioned avoidance techniques have been useful for studying neuroleptics and for predicting their clinical antipsychotic acitivity; the possible involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in the effect of neurolpetics on avoidance behavior is discussed. Tricyclic antidepressant agents have been studied in assays involving interactions with other agents, such as cocaine, amphetamine and tetrabenazine. One type of operant behavior, Sidman avoidance, has been used as particularly sensitive assay for such drug interactions. Another schedule, in which \"observing\" responses in pigeons are measured. seems to provide a method for studying antidepressants without involving drug interaction phenomena. For tricyclic compounds, facilitation of observing responses and weak potency of conditioned avoidance inhibition constitute a pharmacological profile that seems to have some predictive value for clinical imipramine-like antidepressant activity. \"Conflict (punishment) schedules have been useful for predicting antianxiety activity in man. Although the degree of anticonflict effect observed is consistent with Dew's rate dependency hypothesis, this principle does not fully account for the observed drug effects. In the conflict model, the actions of benzodiazepines differ in drug-naive versus drug-experienced animals. Experiments with parachlorophenylalnine have not yet provided clear support for the postulated role of serotonin in related phenomena.", 
    "31": "The effects of drugs on punished responding depend on interactions among a large number of experimental variables. Among these variables are the drug history of the animal, the dose of the drug administered, the type of stimulus used to punish responding, the intensity and duration of the punishing stimulus, the schedule of presentation of the punishing stimulus, the control rate and pattern of punished responding, the schedule of positive reinforcement maintaining the punished responding, the species of animal, the deprivation state of the animal, the behavioral history of the animal, and the nature of the required response. Although it is not known how all of these variables interact to determine the effect of drugs on punished responding, there is evidence that many of these variables are important as determinants of drug effects. The task facing behavioral pharmacologists studying drug effects on punished responding is to determine under what conditions drugs produce their characteristic effects on punished responding.", 
    "32": "Flurazepam hydrochloride is a benzodiazepine derivative marketed for use as a hypnotic agent. Flurazepam is more effective than placebo and is as effective as other hypnotic drugs in most short-term controlled studies. In long-term dosage studies, flurazepam's efficacy persists while other hypnotics become ineffective. Flurazepam has relatively minor effects upon rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and does not lead to REM rebound; this may reduce the likelihood of drug dependence. Flurazepam does not cause enzyme induction and probably presents little hazard of abuse or overdosage. The rational use of hypnotic agents depends as much upon the underlying cause of the sleep disorder as upon the choice of a particular drug. When hypnotic therapy is indicated, flurazepam appears to have advantages over other drugs currently available in the United States.", 
    "33": "Divided into four groups according to different kind and cause of disorder, 240 patients showing psychosomatic disorders have been treated with chlorazepate dipotassium only or in combination with clomipramine and dihydroergotamine tartrate ambulant or in hospital, depending on the degree of severity of the disorder. With 101 clinically treated cases of cyclothymic depression good results were obtained with combined treatment with chlorazepate dipotassium while reducing the dose of the antidepressant. The same result was obtained with 63 patients suffering from severe neurasthenic exhaustion and 13 patients with general neurodystonic symptoms treated with chlorazepate dipotassium only. The combination of the usual dihydroergotamine tartrate medication with a chlorazepate dipotassium treatment over several months showed longlasting good therapeutic results, confirmed by follow-up examinations, in 31 out of 40 cases with migraine respectively vasomotor headache. In the other nine patients with migraine the complaints persisted only in rare instances.", 
    "34": "The ventral interventricular branch of the left coronary artery was ligated in a 2-step operation in 10 dogs whose electrocardiograms and systemic arterial blood pressures were then monitored during the next 7 days. Monitoring was done in awake dogs given 1 mg of diazepam per kilogram of body weight (intravenously administered in 3 dogs and orally in 7). Because ventricualr ectopic activity was greatest during the interval of 10 to 48 hours after ligation, the antiarrhythmic activity of diazepam was recorded during this 38-hour interval. After administration of diazepam by either route, frequency of ventricular ectopic beats decreased from 98 to 80%. THIS REDUCTION BETAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION AND PERSISTED FOR ONLY 5 MINUTES; REDUCTION BEGAN APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR AFTER THE ORAL ADMINISTRATION AND PERSISTED 4 TO 6 HOURS. Systemic arterial blood pressure decreased only after the intravenous administration. It is concluded that diazepam is effective in reducing the frequency of ventricular ectopic activity after occlusion of major branches of coronary arteries, that diazepam works independent of alterations in systemic arterial blood pressure, and that orally administered diazepam prolongs antiarrhythmic activity. Possibly, the adjuvants present in the parenteral form of diazepam reduce antiarrhythmic activity by being, themselves, arrhythmogenic.", 
    "35": "Effects of antidepressant drugs on the amygdaloid after-discharge induced by stimulating the amygdala in rats implanted with chronic electrodes, were investigated in correlation with anti-muricidal effects as well as neurotoxicity. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline markedly depressed both after-discharge and muricide at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses. The effect of PF-257 was also the same as tricyclic antidepressants. On the other hand, methamphetamine and pipradrol blocked the muricide at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses without depressing the amygdaloid after-discharge. Major tranquilizers, chlorpromazine and clozapine depressed both after-discharge and muricide only at doses larger than those which impaired rotarod performance. Haloperidol, on the contrary, depressed the after-discharge without selectively blocking the muricide. Minor tranquilizers, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide did not block the muricide at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses, although they showed a marked depression of the after-discharge.", 
    "36": "Subcutaneous injections of isoniazid or picrotoxin increase the cerebellar content of 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) without changing the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP. This increase was dose dependent and the threshold for the cGMP increase was lower than that for convulsions. In cerebellum the increase of cGMP content elicited by isoniazid but not that caused by picrotoxin was paralleled by a decrease of GABA content. Diazepam doses starting from 1.74 mumol/kg intraperitoneally produced a dose dependent decrease of cerebellar cGMP concentration without changing cAMP or GABA content. Smaller doses of diazepam (0.5 mumol/kg i.p.)failed to decrease the basal cerebellar content of cGMP. However, this dose of diazepam antagonized the increase of cGMP produced by isoniazid but not that produced by picrotoxin. Higher doses of diazepam were necessary to block the increase of cerebellar cGMP elicited by picrotoxin. Low doses of diazepam (0.14 mumol/kg) antagonized the convulsions in 50% of the rats injected with 3.3 mmol/kg of isoniazid. The doses of diazepam required to block picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazol or strychnine convulsions were 7, 25 and 40 times higher than those required to block isoniazid convulsions, respectively. Desmethyldiazepam, chloridiazepoxide, oxazepam were also several times more potent in antagonizing isoniazid than picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazol, or strychnine convulsions. In contrast, barbiturates were equipotent against all the convulsants studied. These experiments suggest that diazepam may act in the CNS either by altering the disposition of endogenous GABA or by mimicking the action of GABA at specific synaptic receptors.", 
    "37": "The take up time of a standardized alimentary material is a simple component of hamster hoarding behaviour. This value was modified by administrations of the following compounds: diazepam, chlorpromazine, meprobamate, apomorphine, d-amphetamine, piribedil, fenfluramine, sulpiride, imipramine, phenobarbital, clonidine and morphine. The change consisted of a varying increase in the take up time, dependent upon the substance and dosage. High doses of chlorpromazine, apomorphine and fenfluramine inhibited the take up. A behavioural study connected with alimentary take up was included in the experiment. Some behavioural modifications (increase or decrease in motor activity, myorelaxation, stereotyped exploration, reciprocating movements) demonstrated differences between the studied compounds related to their pharmacological properties. The immediate consumption of food, without take up and hoarding behaviour, observed with meprobamate treatment, was an interesting and unexpected change in hamster behaviour. The measurement of the take up time and analysis of behavioural modifications may be useful in comparing and preliminary screening of new psychopharmacological compounds.", 
    "38": "A sensitive and specific assay, involving electron capture gas-liquid chromatography, has been developed for the identification of pinazepam and its metabolites in serum, urine and brain samples from dogs and rats after single or repeated oral administration of the drug. Serum and urine samples from healthy humans after a single oral administration have also been analysed. The identity of gas-liquid chromatographic peaks has been established by mass spectrometry. In blood serum and brain, only pinazepam and its N-depropargylated product (demethyldiazepam) were found; from urine, 3-hydroxypinazepam and oxazepam were also recovered. The sensitivity of the gas-liquid chromatographic method is of the order of 5-10 ng of pinazepam and 15-20 ng of the other three benzodiazepines per ml of serum.", 
    "39": "The effect of paracetamol on uric acid determination using a phosphotungstate reduction method has been investigated. The results show that apparently raised values of serum uric acid may be reported in patients receiving therapeutic levels of this drug. Levels of serum uric acid were determined over a five-hour period in three patients who had received therapeutic doses of paracetamol. The assays of serum uric acid were performed by a method based on phosphotungstate reduction and by one employing uricase. The results illustrate the problems of using the former method for clinical purposes.", 
    "40": "Muricidal activity of rats is suppressed by chlordiazepoxide (CDP). At appropriate doses the CDP effect is reversed by repeated testing, by pretreatment with CDP, and by concomitant dosing with caffeine. This points to the general behavioral depressant action of CDP which undergoes tolerance as being primarily responsible for the anti-muricidal activity of CDP.", 
    "41": "The anxiolytic efficacy of oral diazepam, 30 mgs. daily, was investigated in newly admitted psychoneurotic patients, suffering from an anxiety syndrome. A double-blind cross-over design against placebo was used. Ratings were performed weekly using the Hamilton scale for anxiety and other scales. Diazepam was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo for the abatement of the global anxiety syndrome, as objectively and subjectively rated. The symptoms most sensitive to its action are: anxious mood, psychic tension, behavioural unrest, insomnia and respiratory complaints. Side effects were few. Using Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rs) a significant concentration-effect-relationship was found for diazepam (d) and desmethyl-diazepam products (dd). (rs (d) = .35; p less than .02; rs (dd = -.29; p less than .05).", 
    "42": "In experiments with urethan and chloralose anesthetized cats it was found that diazepam (0.15 and 0.5 mg/kg) and trifazine (0.25 and 1 mg/kg), when administered intravenously, produce hypotension, depress the tonicity of the coronary and renal vessels. Under the effect of diazepam there develops bradycardia, the maximal acceleration of the blood flow in the aorta and the cardiac ejection decrease, the systol period gets longer, the coronary circulation rate and the oxygen uptake by the heart go down. Triftazine, on the contrary, augments the blood outflow from the coronary sinus and the oxygen uptake by the myocardium. In the course of 5-10 minutes following introduction thereof it produces tachycardia, intensifies the contractility of the myocardium and the cardiac ejection.", 
    "43": "The effect of diazepam has been watched and studied by continuing monitoring of the heart rate of the mother, the fetus and the newborn, as well as by studying the acid-base balance of the mother and the fetus and the newborn after doses of 20 mg of diazepam had been given to 40 normal labouring women. A good calming effect was found in 87 p. % of women and the remainder had an acceptable result. Both in the mother and in the fetus tachycardia resulted from injection of diazepam as well as a lessening in the frequency of changes in the heart rate. These two alterations were statistically significant (p less than 0.01) and appeared very soon after the administration of the diazepam. Later, no other effects could be found in the mother, the fetus or the newborn.", 
    "44": "Three new cases of methyl bromide poisoning (leakage from a fire extinguisher) are reported. Two of these were characterized, after an initial period of coma and myoclonic status, by an action myoclonus. Electrical data are presented. A follow up of 4 and 8 years allowed to study the effect of drugs, two of which (clonazepam and baclofene) being pecularly contributive. The third patient outlived for 5 years in a stuporous state with myoclonus. The anatomical findings consisted mainly of a necrosis of both inferior colliculi with gliosis in the upper brain stem reticular formation and moderate changes in the dentate and pontine nuclei. Their significance is discussed in view of physiological and experimental knowledge.", 
    "45": "The nutritive sucking performance of congenitally addicted infants undergoing narcotic withdrawal was used to provide objective measures of adaptive behavior in a series of 50 infants born to mothers addicted either to heroin or methadone. Sucking rates as well as average pressures developed during sucking were significantly reduced for the addicted infants relative to a control group born to normal mothers and a second control group born to toxemic mothers. The subgroup of infants born to methadone-addicted mothers was significantly more depressed with regard to sucking behavior than the infants of heroin-addicted mothers. Furthermore, infants treated with paregoric (an opiate) for symptoms of the narcotic withdrawal syndrome showed significantly less depression of the sucking response than those treated with sedatives such as phenobarbital.", 
    "46": "We have investigated hypotheses that link the stiff-man syndrome to an imbalance of neurotransmitter systems. No evidence was found to support the concept of defective synaptic transmission at either cholinergic input to Renshaw inhibitory elements or at glycinergic inhibitory input to motoneurons from spinal interneurons, since neither physostigmine nor glycine altered symptomatology. Urinary excretion of the norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl glycol showed a high correlation with clinical status. This suggests the involvement in the stiff-man syndrome of a central norepinephrine neuronal system that has net excitatory effects upon motoneurons, a system whose activity can be increased slightly by levodopa and decreased markedly by diazepam, with corresponding changes in stiffness.", 
    "47": "In two siblings with limb-girdle muscle weakness and episodic headaches and vomiting from early childhood, progressive neurologic degeneration later developed, and both children died. In one child, corticosteroids induced improvement in both cerebral and muscular symptoms that lasted 1 year. This patient had elevated blood, urine, and spinal fluid lactate levels, together with increased cardiac output and oxygen consumption at rest. Several muscle fibers were characterized by a \"ragged red\" appearance with the trichrome stain. Subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar excess of mitochondrial oxidative enzyme reaction product was correlated with abnormal mitochondrial aggregates by electron microscopy. The brain revealed focal areas of cortical degeneration and necrosis with adjacent gliosis or edema. Ferrocalcific deposits were prominent in the globus pallidus. The other sibling had similar changes in the brain at autopsy. This familial multisystem disorder especially involving the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart appears to represent a defect in some mitochondrial oxidative mechanism.", 
    "48": "To overcome the disadvantages of other methods, the authors have devised a procedure for below-the-knee operations, involving a new technic of sciatic-femoral nerve block. The technic has so far been successful without use of adjuvant agents in 90 percent of over 100 patients so handled.", 
    "49": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were made in a series of 92 male surgical patients, to assess the effects of timing and dosage of succinylcholine given after a standardized sleep dose of thiopental (3 mg./kg.). The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) thiopental alone lowered IOP; (2) a small (0.5 mg./kg.) dose of succinylcholine, given immediately after thiopental, returned IOP to normal; (3) a large (1 mg./kg.) dose of succinylcholine immediately after thiopental maintained the IOP at a low value; (4) if 2 minutes elapsed between thiopental and 1 mg./kg. of succinylcholine, the relaxant raised the IOP to slightly above preanesthetic control values; (5) tracheal intubation caused a significant rise in IOP, more than any effect from succinylcholine itself; (6) succinylcholine drip (0.1 percent), begun after establishment of satisfactory endotracheal halothane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, caused significant IOP elevation in 4 of 11 patients.", 
    "50": "During an exploratory laparotomy for a pheochromocytoma under isoflurane anesthesia, the blood pressure of the patient rose to 250/115 torr, without ventricular arrhythmias. The authors consider isoflurane worthy of further study for pheochromocytoma-surgery anesthesia, in comparison with other presently used agents.", 
    "51": "An approach to the patient is described that is of value when operations are performed under local analgesia during intravenous sedation with diazepam. The technique involves maintained distraction of the patient with some phantasy of his own choice. All mention of the different stages of the procedure is deliberately avoided.", 
    "52": "One of four groups of patients was not premedicated; the others received diazepam 10 mg by mouth, diazepam 20 mg by mouth or a combination of pentobarbitone orally and morphine and hyoscine intramuscularly. The cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were studied before and after the premedication and any changes in sedation, apprehension and reaction to pain were noted. The ease of induction of anaesthesia in the four groups was compared. Most of the patients who received the pentobarbitone, morphine and hyoscine combination came to theatre calm, sedated and often asleep. They showed no significant cardiovascular or respiratory depression and the induction of anaesthesia was more satisfactory than in the other groups. Two of the patients who were not premedicated became very agitated in the ward and the remainder of the patients in this group were apprehensive in the anaesthetic room and during induction. The effects of diazepam in the two doses studied were intermediate between those who received the pentobarbitone, morphine and hyoscine and those who were not premedicated."
