    "0": "[3H]Muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding activities have been solubilized from bovine cortex using the ionic detergent sodium deoxycholate. The soluble receptor proteins were shown to bind [3H]muscimol with a dissociation constant, Kd, of 12 nM and a binding capacity (Bmax value) of 1.56 pmol/mg protein; gamma-amino[3H]-butyric acid with a Kd of 50 nM and Bmax of 1.55 pmol/mg protein; and [3H]flunitrazepam with a Kd of 8 nM and a Bmax of 0.8 pmol/mg protein. Gel filtration of the soluble receptor proteins showed that the gamma-amino[3H]butyric acid and [3H]flunitrazepam binding activities comigrated with a Stokes radius of 6.8 nm. The two binding activities were also found to comigrate after sedimentation in a sucrose density gradient. The hydrodynamic properties of the assumed protein-detergent complexes were determined by gel filtration and sedimentation through gradients of sucrose in H2O or 2H2O. Under the conditions employed, the parameters for both the putative gamma-aminobutyric acid and benzodiazepine receptors were: partial specific volume, 0.73 ml g-1; sedimentation coefficient, 12.5 S; molecular weight, 355000; and frictional ratio 1.46. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that the majority of both binding activities solubilized in deoxycholate reside in a single macromolecular complex. However, Triton X-100 selectively solubilized the benzodiazepine binding activity. This suggests that the two binding activities can be at least partially separated.", 
    "1": "Pyrazolopyridines, such as etazolate (SQ 20009), enhance [3H]diazepam binding to a Lubrol-solubilized fraction that has specific binding sites for 3H benzodiazepines, [alpha-3H]dihydropicrotoxinin (DHP) and [3H]muscimol. Etazolate enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding was inhibited by picrotoxinin. Furthermore, etazolate inhibited the [3H]DHP binding in a Lubrol-solubilized fraction with an IC50 value of 6-8 microM. These results provide evidence that etazolate, like pentobarbital, modulates benzodiazepine binding via the DHP-sensitive site of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "2": "The system of monitoring the patterns of prescription and consumption of addictive drugs by utilizing computerized data on prescriptions collected in pharmacies throughout Norway is described. The number of prescriptions for narcotic drugs issued in out-patient facilities substantially decreased in the period 1970-1980. Statistics also indicate a decrease in the sale of barbiturates and sedative-hypnotics during the period 1974-1980, while the sale of benzodiazepines increased during the same period. The monitoring system provides reliable information on the use of legally prescribed drugs, which proves useful to the authorities in undertaking appropriate control measures of such drugs.", 
    "3": "Papio papio may show two different kinds of myoclonus. A first type corresponds to myoclonus induced by photic stimulation (25 Hz). This type is always preceded by paroxysmal discharges. Another type of myoclonus may be induced, or at least facilitated, by some benzodiazepines, especially lorazepam and, to a lesser extent, diazepam. This type is neither preceded nor accompanied by paroxysmal discharges. A single injection of lorazepam (1 mg/kg i.v.) blocks the first type of myoclonus but favors the appearance of the second. However, these effects do not follow the same evolution; while myoclonus induced by photic stimulation disappears immediately after the injection, benzodiazepine-induced myoclonus appears only 10-15 min. Furthermore, whereas the former reappears after 150-210 min, the latter may persist for a longer time (up to 1 h). A preliminary pharmacologic study of benzodiazepine-induced myoclonus indicates that drugs increasing brain GABA level block this type of myoclonus. The possible reticular origin of benzodiazepine-induced myoclonus is suggested.", 
    "4": "One hundred and forty-five men were randomly allocated on a double-blind basis to receive either temazepam 20 mg, diazepam 10 mg or placebo as premedication. Temazepam produced more sedation than either diazepam or placebo. Postoperative recovery was assessed by a simple visuo-motor co-ordination test and was best in the placebo group. Two hours into recovery, temazepam patients could almost match their baseline performance whereas the performance of the diazepam patients was still significantly worse than pre-operatively. Temazepam is suggested as a suitable premedicant for elderly patients undergoing minor surgery.", 
    "5": "In 18 normal volunteers, lorazepam (2.5 mg) compared with placebo significantly impaired performance in a verbal learning task, in the digit-symbol substitution test, and in symbol copying and number cancellation tasks. These impairments were found equally in subjects with high and low state anxiety and in subjects with high and low trait anxiety. Caffeine citrate (125 to 500 mg) significantly improved performance on the digit-symbol substitution test when given alone and reduced the lorazepam impairment. In the symbol copying test caffeine counteracted the lorazepam impairment. Lorazepam produced a significant loss of appetite and made the subjects feel significantly more dizzy, physically and mentally tired, withdrawn and tranquil, and significantly less anxious. Caffeine citrate (500 mg) counteracted the lorazepam effect of reducing anxiety and making the subjects feel more relaxed.", 
    "6": "By random allocation 41 patients received 1 mg flunitrazepam orally the night before operation and 1 mg on the morning of operation (group 1), and another 41 received 100 mg pentobarbital orally the night before operation, followed by intramuscular scopolamine (0.006 mg/kg) + morphine (0.02 mg/kg) on the morning of operation (group 2). All patients received 0.5 mg atropine intravenously just before the induction of anesthesia. The patients in group 2 were better sedated and had less salivary secretion than those in group 1, but otherwise both were comparable. In group 2 the induction requirements of thiopentone were significantly decreased in comparison with group 1, again indicating a more potent sedative effect. Because even in the total scoring of the results there was no significant difference between the two groups, the easy oral route of administration of flunitrazepam offers a clinically relevant alternative to the conventional premedication. In some of these E.N.T. patients who received flunitrazepam, intravenous atropine given just before the induction of anesthesia was unable to prevent salivary secretion. Oral benzodiazepine derivatives (flunitrazepam) appear to be useful before surgery as the old type of premedication (oral pentobarbital + i.m. scopolamine and morphine).", 
    "7": "It has been frequently suggested that physicians' indiscriminate prescribing has caused the high level of patient use of benzodiazepines. To determine whether this was true at Ottawa Civic Hospital's Family Medicine Centre, patient charts of women aged 45 to 65-the age-sex group that received the highest number of new prescriptions for diazepam (Valium) or oxazepam (Serax) - were studied. Middle-aged women who received a new prescription for one of these drugs visited the office significantly more often, had more marital problems, and experienced significantly more life crisis situation than a control group of nonrecipients. These results suggest that the high rate of prescribing is related to high levels of reported life stress in middle-aged women. Further studies in other centers are needed to conclusively disprove the popularly held idea that benzodiazepines are indiscriminately prescribed by physicians.", 
    "8": "A chronic schizophrenic patient with a neuroleptic-induced dystonic reaction and akathisia, both of which were unresponsive to benztropine and diphenhydramine, derived rapid therapeutic benefit from diazepam. This case report indicates that low-dose diazepam may be an extrapyramidal symptoms in some patients.", 
    "9": "1 Intracerebroventricular administration of diazepam or midazolam decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine in rats as measured by the \"tail flick\" method. 2 Midazolam, injected into the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) antagonized the analgesic effect of morphine. The action of midazolam was partially reversed by bicuculline. 3 These findings support the view that the effect of benzodiazephines on morphine antinociception may be mediated through gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors.", 
    "10": "1 A radioreceptor assay has been established to measure the receptor affinities of numerous benzodiazepines in clinical use. 2 The time course of receptor binding activity was studied by this method in the plasma of eight healthy subjects randomly treated with 1 mg lormetazepam (Noctamid, 2 mg flunitrazepam (Rohypnol, and 10 mg diazepam (Valium, and placebo on a cross-over basis. Blood samples were collected up to 154 h after treatment. 3 Receptor affinities of numerous benzodiazepines on vitro show good correlation with therapeutic human doses (r = 0.96) and may be predictive of drug potency in man. 4 Mean peak plasma levels of lormetazepam binding equivalents were 4.8 +/- 1 ng/ml at 2 h after lormetazepam, 7.2 +/- 1.8 ng/ml at 8 h after flunitrazepam, and 17.9 +/- 2.7 ng/ml at 15 h after diazepam. Plasma elimination half-lives of benzodiazepine binding equivalents were 9.3, 23 and 63 h, respectively. 5 Slow elimination of benzodiazepine binding equivalents following flunitrazepam and diazepam may be due to persistent active metabolites.", 
    "11": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor was solubilized from synaptic membrane of the rat brain by various detergents. Nonidet P-40, a non-ionic detergent, was found to be an effective solubilizing agent, since it caused no interference on the receptor binding assay, yielded a [3H]muscimol binding protein with a high specific activity and no aggregation, and preserved good stability of the solubilized fraction. Ammonium sulfate precipitation of the solubilized supernatant significantly increased the binding of [3H]muscimol to GABA receptor, possibly by removing heat-stable and small molecular inhibitory substances. The specific [3H]muscimol binding to the soluble fraction obtained by Nonidet P-40 treatment and subsequent ammonium sulfate precipitation, was saturable with KD 13 and 64 nM, and Bmax 3.4 and 1.8 pmol/mg protein, respectively. The enhancement of the [3H]muscimol binding by diazepam as found in synaptic membrane was also detected in the soluble fraction. Molecular weight of the [3H]muscimol binding site was determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and was calculated to be 270,000 daltons. This value was identical with that of the [3H]flunitrazepam binding site which appeared in the same solubilized fraction. These results indicate that the properties of solubilized GABA receptor are identical to those of membrane-bound GABA receptor. Furthermore, the present results suggest that both GABA and benzodiazepine receptors may reside on the same macromolecule in synaptic membrane.", 
    "12": "Ninety-seven poor sleepers aged 40-68 years took capsules nightly for 32 weeks and made daily subjective ratings. The benzodiazepine hypnotics lormetazepam 2 mg and nitrazepam 5 mg appeared still to improve sleep after 24 weeks of intake when compared with continuous placebo intake. The sustained effectiveness was most evident in a significant shortening of the time taken to fall asleep in patients receiving lormetazepam. After weeks, sleep latency and the quality of sleep were significantly worse than baseline values. The impairment was maximal on the second night after withdrawal of lormetazepam and on the fourth night after withdrawal of nitrazepam. It is concluded that benzodiazepines remain effective for at least 24 weeks but that a period of disturbed sleep may be expected after withdrawal.", 
    "13": "Saturable, specific, high affinity binding of the potent adenosine uptake inhibitor [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine ([3H]NBI) to brain membranes has been demonstrated. In an effort to test the hypothesis that benzodiazepine action may be due to the inhibition of adenosine uptake, the inhibition of [3H]NBI binding by diazepam, clonazepam and chlordiazepoxide was tested. The benzodiazepines are very weak inhibitors of [#H]NBI binding, having IC50 values several orders of magnitude above their therapeutic levels.", 
    "14": "Diazepam (3 nM-3 microM) enhanced GABA binding to well-washed synaptosomal membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. Half maximal enhancement occurred at 20 nM diazepam. Kinetic analysis by non-linear Scatchard analysis revealed that the primary action of diazepam was to increase the affinity of GABA binding to a low affinity site. These results support electrophysiological and other biochemical observations of benzodiazepine-GABA interactions.", 
    "15": "Ethylenediamine (EDA) acted as a GABA agonist by enhancing [3H]diazepam binding to well-washed rat forebrain membrane preparations in a bicuculline-sensitive manner, although its potency was 700-800 times less than that of GABA. EDA was over 3750 times weaker than GABA as a displacer of [3H]GABA bound to membrane receptors and was over 40-fold weaker than GABA at [3H]GABA uptake sites. Its most potent action was as an inhibitor of [3H]beta-alanine uptake into rat cerebral cortex slices. Thus, EDA may show some selectivity for glial rather than neuronal GABA uptake. These data suggest that EDA is a very weak GABA agonist in these in vitro systems and are consistent with EDA bearing a closer structural resemblance to beta-alanine than to GABA.", 
    "16": "We investigated the effects of benzodiazepines on [3H]muscimol binding to rat brain membranes and on heat inactivation of GABA receptors. Scatchard analysis of [3H]muscimol binding to frozen and 0.05% Triton X-100 treated membranes revealed two components; a higher affinity (Kd = 2.2 nM, Bmax = 1.2 pmol/mg protein) and a lower affinity component (Kd = 15.9 nM, Bmax = 4.4 pmol/mg protein). Diazepam and flurazepam (3 microM) increases significantly the specific binding of 40 nM but not of 2 nM [3H]muscimol. This stimulation was attributed to an increase in the affinity of the lower affinity component for GABA receptors. The time course of heat inactivation of GABA receptors revealed rapidly and then slowly denaturating Phases. These observations would suggest that there are multiple GABA receptors with different sensitivities to the heat treatment. Diazepam depressed remarkably the slowly denaturating phase(s). After heat treatment for 50 min, the single component of GABA receptors with Kd of 14.3 nM and Bmax of 0.6 pmol/mg protein survived, whereas in the membranes preincubated with 3 microM diazepam, the Kd and Bmax of the still viable GABA receptors were 14.8 nM and 1.14 pmol/mg protein, respectively. In light of these findings, the stimulation of the lower affinity component of GABA receptors may be related to the protective effects of these drugs against heat inactivation.", 
    "17": "A series of 8 tetrazole derivatives which differ more than one hundred-fold in their potencies as convulsants were tested for their abilities to inhibit [3H]diazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors in vitro. The concentrations of drug necessary to inhibit 50% of specifically bound [3H]diazepam ranges from 18 micro M for undecamethylenetetrazole to 20 mM for trimethylenetetrazole. A comparison of the minimum convulsive doses for the 8 tetrazole derivatives tested with their relative potencies in displacing [3H]diazepam binding in vitro revealed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001). In contrast, several representative tetrazole derivatives were found to have no inhibitory effects on beta-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the same membrane preparation. These results suggest that pentamethylenetetrazole and related tetrazole derivatives may elicit their convulsant effects by interaction with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "18": "Midazolam is determined in serum by gas chromatography with a nitrogen-selective detector, by liquid chromatography, and by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. Comparable results are obtained with the three techniques with a within-run precision of 9% by gas chromatography and gas chromatography---mass spectrometry and 5% by liquid chromatography. Between-run precision is 13% by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry and 10% by liquid chromatography. Comparison of patient's sera by gas chromatography (x), liquid chromatography (y), and by gas chromatography (x), gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (y) gave correlations of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. Interferences observed when using one technique, for example liquid chromatography, can be eliminated by analyzing the sample extract with one of the other techniques.", 
    "19": "Tracazolate (ICI 136,753, 4-butylamino-1-ethyl-6-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) demonstrated dose-related anticonflict activity in rats and mice. The potency of tracazolate appears to be one-quarter to one-half that of chlordiazepoxide. No tolerance to the anticonflict activity of either tracazolate or chlordiazepoxide was evident following 12 consecutive days of treatment. Tracazolate exhibits a much greater separation between sedative and therapeutic doses than does chlordiazepoxide. Furthermore, based on rodent studies, tracazolate should be much less likely than the benzodiazepines to potentiate the actions of barbiturates and ethanol in man. Tracazolate potentiated both the anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects of chlordiazepoxide in rodents. Unlike benzodiazepines, tracazolate enhances the binding of benzodiazepines to its receptor site. These results suggest that tracazolate is a novel agent with potential clinical utility as an anxiolytic drug.", 
    "20": "Tracazolate (ICI 136,753) 4-butylamine-1-ethyl-6-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4]pyridine-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester is a non-benzodiazepine with anxiolytic-like activity in animal models. In contrast to the benzodiazepines, it enhances [3H]flunitrazepam binding in rat synaptic membrane fragments. The enhancement is potential by chloride ion and is due to an increase in affinity of the receptor. The enhancement of benzodiazepine binding by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is additive with that of tracazolate; however, the GABA antagonist bicuculline blocks the enhancement by both compounds. Tracazolate enhances [3H]GABA binding to frozen and thawed Triton X-100-treated membrane fragments. The enhancement is due to an increase in the number of sites and potentiated by chloride. Benzodiazepines also enhanced GABA binding but the effect was due to an apparent change in affinity and not potentiated by chloride. The rank order to chlorodiazepoxide, diazepam and flunitrazepam for enhancement of GABA binding and displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding were the same. The enhancement of [3H]GABA binding by flunitrazepam and tracazolate were additive. Possible interactions between these various receptors are discussed.", 
    "21": "The relation of breast cancer to diazepam use was evaluated in a case-control study of 1236 women with breast cancer and 728 control subjects with other malignancies. Compared to women who never used diazepam, the relative risk for women who used the drug at least 4 days per week for at least 6 months was estimated to be 0.9, with 95% confidence limits of 0.5 and 1.6. There was no apparent association for recent use, or for use in the distant past, although confidence intervals were fairly wide in these categories. The results were not explained by various potential confounding factors, including the major risk factors for breast cancer. The findings suggest that regular diazepam use does not increase the risk of breast cancer relative to other cancers.", 
    "22": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), caerulein and diazepam inhibited exploratory rearing activity and harman-induced convulsions in mice. Pretreatment with the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, reduced or abolished the sedative and anticonvulsive effects of diazepam, but left the same effects of both peptides unaffected. The peptide-induced ptosis was even increased by Ro 15-1788. The results suggest that the CCK-like peptides do not directly interact with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "23": "The effects of single oral administrations of tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and desipramine), an atypical antidepressant (nomifensine), known anorexic agents, haloperidol, and diazepam on food intake were compared in Sprague-Dawley rats over a 4-day test period. The tricyclic antidepressants produced decreases in food intake during the total 4-day test period following their administration. In contrast, the anorexic agents (d-amphetamine, cocaine, mazindol, fenfluramine and quipazine), and nomifensine, and haloperidol produced decreases in food intake only on their administration. Diazepam produced an increase in food intake only on the day of its decrease food intake, this model appears to show some specificity for tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "24": "An improved experimental design for studying the enterohepatic circulation of drugs in a pair of bile duct-duodenum cannula-linked rats is described. By housing the rats in individual metabolism cages and using a peristaltic pump to immediately deliver bile secreted by the donor directly into the duodenum of the recipient, the method permits a realistic approximation of biliary excretion and reabsorption in intact animals for periods up to 96 hours.", 
    "25": "A radioreceptor assay (RRA) for determining benzodiazepines (BZ) has been developed and applied to toxicological analysis of serum from 21 patients with acute BZ overdosage. The method was sensitive (e.g., lorazepam 17 nM, diazepam 41 nM), and specific for pharmacologically active BZ derivatives. The reproducibility of the results was good (intra-assay variation less than 8%, inter-assay variation less than 10%). Concentrations measured by the RRA showed a good correlation with those obtained by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of the same samples. The quantitative results represent the sum of one or several parent substances and all biologically active metabolites, in proportion to their receptor binding affinities.", 
    "26": "Metrazol (80 mg/kg s. c.) elicited ECoG episodes of rhythmic activity the shape, frequency and localization of which depended on the age of rats. In 15- and 12-day-old animals there was a progression into sustained ictal activity. Clonazepam (1 mg/kg i. p.) exhibited excellent anti-metrazol action in adult, 25- and 12-day-old rats. The results in 15-day-old animals were inconsistent. Ethosuximide (125 mg/kg i. p.) protected sufficiently only adult and 25-day-old rats. In younger age groups only ictal activity was blocked, while metrazol-induced episodes remained untouched.", 
    "27": "Pain rating, withdrawal reflex and skin resistance reaction upon electrical skin stimuli were studied on 15 male volunteers under placebo, tilidine and prazepam. Tilidine (Valoron) is an orally applicable narcotic analgesic, with a mode of pain relief presumably similar to morphine; the tranquilizer prazepam (Demetrin) belongs to the benzodiazepine group. Significant reduction in all measured reaction amplitudes was found under tilidine, whereas prazepam reduced significantly only the skin resistance reaction. The relative drug-induced changes in reaction amplitudes, related to the corresponding placebo value, were independent of stimulus intensity for all investigated reactions. Therefore, fitted power functions re = a . Sn between reaction amplitudes re and stimulus intensity S showed a decrease in parameter a under the investigated drugs, whereas the exponent n remained constant. High correlations between parameters a and corresponding reciprocal threshold currents could be shown for all reactions measured. Furthermore the drug-induced changes of withdrawal reflex amplitude and of subjective estimation were found to be correlated over subjects. In contrast, no correlations were found between variations in skin resistance reaction and magnitude estimation due to the selected drugs, i.e., the influence of the drugs on the sensory component of pain sensation and on the skin resistance reaction were independent effects.", 
    "28": "Using liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection (LCEC), we have measured the accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) (after L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibition), dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the frontal cortex and in the corpus striatum of the rat. Mild-footshock stress increased frontal cortex DOPA accumulation, as well as DA and DOPAC, without changing the concentration of these substances in the corpus striatum. The increases in cortical DA synthesis and metabolism were antagonized by diazepam which, given alone, tended to decrease DOPA accumulation to a small degree. In addition, we have measured the indoles serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and the noradrenergic metabolite MHPG, none of which were altered by stress. The accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was also unaffected by stress but, like DOPA accumulation, was reduced to a small degree by diazepam. This study directly demonstrates a selective activation of frontal cortex catechol synthesis (in vivo tyrosine hydroxylation) by a mild stress, which did not significantly alter cortical noradrenergic or serotonergic metabolism.", 
    "29": "The study was designed to test the theoretical predictions that high-sensation seekers feel and function better than low-sensation seekers under conditions of heightened arousal, whereas lows perform better than highs when central nervous system arousal levels are dampened. Thirty-two male medical students scoring in either the top or bottom deciles of their class on the total score of the Sensation Seeking Scale, Form V, were administered placebo, stimulant, and depressant drug treatments (each substance in a different session). Results did not support an optimal level of arousal model of sensation seeking, in that affective, cognitive, and motoric responses to drugs that increased or decreased tonic levels of arousal generally failed to differentiate high- and low-sensation seekers.", 
    "30": "A comprehensive analysis of the cat brain electrograms (EG) by computer has revealed that the derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepine (chlorodiazepoxide, diazepam) selectivity increase the modules of brain transients within the ranges of 8-12 and 10-12 Hz largely on the EG of the proreal gyrus and paleocortical structures and raise in the same spectral region the level of coherence between biopotentials of the limbic structures, displace the coefficients of asymmetry and excess unidimensional distributions of the instantaneous values of the EG amplitudes towards negative magnitudes. The indicators in question may be used as differential criteria of the tranquilizing effect of neurotropic substances. It is suggested that the increase in the modules of brain transients within the ranges of 8-10, 10-12 Hz during exposure to neurotropic substances is likely to mirror their central GABA-ergic mechanisms and to be an integral electrophysiological correlate of tranquilization as a psychophysiological state.", 
    "31": "The kinetics of diazepam absorption were assessed in 37 healthy volunteers, aged 19--79 years, who ingested a single 5-mg tablet in the fasting state. Diazepam plasma concentrations were measured by gas chromatography in multiple samples drawn over the next 72 hr. After a lag time averaging 12 min elapsed between tablet ingestion and the start of absorption, first-order absorption proceeded with a mean half-life of 19 min (range: 0--96 min), with peak plasma concentrations reached 0.9 hr after dosage (range: 0.25--2.5 hr). Age and sex did not influence absorption kinetics. Peak plasma concentrations averaged 157 ng/ml, and tended to be higher in women than in men because of lower body weights in women. Peak levels also declined with age, probably due to increased volume of distribution of diazepam in the elderly. Absolute systemic availability of oral diazepam was evaluated in seven of the subjects who received intravenous diazepam on another occasion. Based on areas under the oral versus intravenous plasma concentration curve, bioavailability of diazepam averaged 97%. Six male patients, at least 2 years after undergoing Billroth gastrectomy, also participated in the diazepam absorption study. Absorption kinetic parameters were nearly identical to those in six healthy age-matched male volunteers without gastrointestinal disease. Thus absorption of oral diazepam in the fasting state is rapid and nearly complete, and is minimally influenced by age, sex, or Billroth gastrectomy.", 
    "32": "The efficacy of diazepam in attenuation of succinylcholine-induced muscle fasciculations was studied in the dog. Dosage levels of 0.11, 0.22, 0.55, or 1.1 mg of diazepam/kg of body weight were studied in 4 groups of 5 dogs each; another group of 5 dogs served as a control. There was no difference in the occurrence or severity of succinylcholine-induced muscle fasciculations between dogs given diazepam and nontreated controls. Using serum potassium as a quantitative index of physiologic effects of muscle depolarization, differences could not be detected between treated and nontreated dogs.", 
    "33": "Twenty-four middle-aged male chronically anxious outpatients who were taking diazepam at a mean dose of 17 mg/day for a mean duration of 5 years were assigned to maintenance (M), gradual withdrawal (GW) or abrupt withdrawal (AW) and followed weekly. No differences were seen in two self-report anxiety measures or in withdrawal symptoms between groups. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores were slightly elevated (F = 2.34, P less than 0.05) in the AW patients at a mean duration of 4 weeks off diazepam. Thus, withdrawal from chronic diazepam (10-30 mg/day) use produced no prominent withdrawal syndrome, but the suggestion of gradual anxiety recurrence indicates the need fro longer-term follow-up studies to adequately assess maintenance efficacy.", 
    "34": "Methods for the quantitation of flurazepam in plasma and bone marrow were developed for the purpose of determining the relationship between flurazepam concentrations in both tissues. Albino New Zealand rabbits, given flurazepam in doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, were sacrificed either one or three hours after drug administration. Flurazepam concentrations in plasma and bone marrow were determined utilizing a gas-liquid chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector. the average plasma/bone marrow flurazepam ratios were 0.033 +/- 0.012 and 0.024 +/- 0.012 for rabbits sacrificed one hour and three hours after dosing, respectively. This study showed that a range of plasma flurazepam levels can be estimated from known bone marrow concentrations. The overall mean plasma/bone marrow ratio for all rabbits used in this study was 0.029 +/- 0.012 with a range of 0.010 to 0.055.", 
    "35": "1 The absorption of single doses of diazepam in six adult epileptic subjects following intravenous, oral and rectal administration were studied in order to evaluate the usefulness of the latter in emergency situations in the adult. 2 Diazepam tablets (Valium, Roche) and rectal solution (Valium solution for intravenous administration) produced similar peak serum concentrations after delays of 15-90 min. 3 Two suppository formulations showed statistically significant differences in absorption characteristics. 4 Serum diazepam levels above 400 ng ml-1 (suggested to be necessary for a satisfactory anticonvulsant effect) were reached in only a few subjects after rectal doses of 10-20 mg of solution, and then usually after a delay of over 2 h.", 
    "36": "1 The effects of sex and oral contraceptives (OC) on the disposition of oral nitrazepam were studied in six healthy young males, in six healthy young females in the follicular and luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and in six healthy young females using OC-steroids in two stages of the pill cycle. 2 There was no influence of the menstrual cycle on the pharmacokinetic parameters of nitrazepam, nor was there a significant difference between these parameters in males and females in either phase of the cycle. The elimination half-life was 27.3 +/- 1.3 h in males, 27.7 +/- 1.5 h in females in the follicular phase and 29.6 +/- 1.4 h in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Total plasma clearance was 59.3 +/- 2.7 ml/min, 58.2 +/- 3.3 and 55.8 +/- 5.0 ml/min respectively. 3 The use of OC-steroids did not significantly alter the elimination half-life of nitrazepam: 30.6 +/- 2.3 and 31.2 +/- 2.2 h in the first and second half of the pill cycle. The total nitrazepam clearance in these females (46.6 +/- 4.6 and 45.6 +/- 4.1 ml/min) was significantly lower than in males (P less than 0.05). 4 The protein unbound fraction of nitrazepam was progressively higher going from males (11.4 +/- 0.1%) to females in the luteal phase of the cycle (12.4 +/- 0.5%) to females using OC-steroids (13.5 +/- 0.4%). Only the difference between males and females using OC-steroids was statistically significant. 5 The clearance calculated relative to the unbound drug (intrinsic clearance) was significantly decreased in females taking OC-steroids as compared to males and females not taking them (Cli = 323 +/- 30 ml/min in females using OC-steroids, 530 +/- 37 ml/min in males and 459 +/- 40 ml/min in females). 6 The results of this study are not likely to have important consequences for dosage of nitrazepam as an hypnotic. The most pronounced effect observed was inhibition of nitrazepam clearance and especially intrinsic clearance by OC-steroids. Females on OC-steroids taking a nitrazepam tablet every evening, will have highly steady levels of nitrazepam (and certainly of unbound nitrazepam) than males or females not taking OC-steroids.", 
    "37": "The effects of midazolam maleate and diazepam on cerebral metabolism and circulation were examined for each drug in six dogs maintained on N2O 70 per cent and halothane less than 0.1 per cent. Midazolam maleate at 0.2 mg/kg and diazepam at 0.3 mg/kg (the ED 100 per cent for induction of anesthesia for each drug in humans) did not decrease metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) but did decrease cerebral blood flow (CBF) to about 55 per cent of control. Additional drug administrations (2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg midazolam maleate, and 3.0 and 7.5 mg/kg diazepam) resulted in dose-related decreases in CMRO2 to a maximum of 55 per cent of control after 10.0 mg/kg midazolam maleate. Concomitant with the initial decreases in CMRO2, there was a change in the EEG as reflected by a decrease in frequency and an increase in amplitude. This EEG change suggests that 2.0 mg/kg midazolam maleate and 3.0 mg/kg diazepam represent a comparable canine anesthetic dose. Each additional dose of midazolam maleate decreased CBF to a greater extent than did the added doses of diazepam. Brain biopsies taken at the end of the midazolam maleate studies revealed a normal cerebral energy state (phosphocreatine, ATP, ADP, and AMP) and normal glucose, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations. In a hypoxic mouse model (FIO2 = 0.05), midazolam maleate provided greater protection from hypoxia (2.8 x control survival time) than diazepam (1.6 x control survival time). By comparison barbiturates in this model provide a survival time which is 4.0 x control.", 
    "38": "The clinically observed results in 40 patients, from 1 to 15 years old, presenting sleep disturbances, in a comparative and statistically approached study of flurazepam 15mg daily against placebo, are reported. Placebo was administered, followed by the drug, during 14 days each. The chief complaints were sleepwalking, sleep-talking, sleep terror, sleep-related bruxism, sleep-related headbanging, insomnia and excessive movements during sleep. A significant effect of flurazepam on sleepwalking, sleep-talking, bruxism, sleep terror and excessive movement during sleep, was observed. The insomniac headbanging patients were not enough for statistical analysis. Flurazepam side effects were excessive drowsiness during daytime in 3 cases; irritability, 3 cases; nausea and vomiting, 2 cases, and were not correlated with age. Placebo side effects were similar, except for nausea and vomiting which were not observed. It was necessary to discontinue flurazepam in 2 cases, because of excessive drowsiness during daytime, which did not improve when reducing the dose.", 
    "39": "Thirty patients scheduled for routine eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive either diazepam 0.2 mg/kg or ascorbic acid 100 mg orally 90 minutes pre-operatively in a double-blind fashion. Diazepam caused no significant change in intra-ocular pressure.", 
    "40": "In an attempt to exploit the benefits and to reduce the incidence of side-effects of etomidate during intravenous sedation for nervous patients undergoing oral surgery under local analgesia, a series of four clinical trials were undertaken: a pilot study in which etomidate was preceded by a combination of pentazocine and diazepam; a double-blind study in which saline was randomly substituted for the etomidate, and two further studies in which the administration of etomidate was preceded by that of either pentazocine or diazepam alone. The combination of a small dose of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) with an initial dose of etomidate (0.1 mg/kg) followed by increments of the latter as necessary proved to be most successful in reducing the severity of unwanted reactions while retaining the unique advantages of etomidate.", 
    "41": "Pharmacokinetic data in obesity are only available for a limited number of drugs. The rate or extent of drug absorption is not known to be altered by obesity which is not complicated by other medical disease. In contrast, drug distribution is in some instances significantly altered in obesity. Digoxin and bromsulphalein, both hydrophilic drugs, do not distribute into excess bodyweight over ideal bodyweight. However, antipyrine, paracetamol, aminoglycoside antibiotics and theophylline, all of intermediate lipid solubility, distribute to a limited extent into excess bodyweight over ideal bodyweight, although not as extensively as into ideal bodyweight. Benzodiazepines, halothane and enflurane, highly lipophilic agents, may distribute much more extensively into excess bodyweight over ideal bodyweight than into ideal bodyweight. This suggests some relationship between drug distribution and drug lipid-solubility in obese subjects. Whether these distributional changes in obesity will hold for other drugs is not currently known. Drug protein binding has not been demonstrated to be changed in obesity, data being presently available only for the basic drugs diazepam and desmethyldiazepam. Drug biotransformation in obesity is unchanged for oxidatively metabolised drugs studied to date. Paracetamol, the only metabolised drug which is conjugated for which pharmacokinetic parameters have been accurately determined in obesity, undergoes increased clearance in obese subjects.", 
    "42": "Cimetidine is widely prescribed but has numerous potential side effects, especially in elder patients, who require a lower dosage, e.g., 300 mg twice daily. Antacids may be more effective than cimetidine in preventing acute gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill elderly patients. Cimetidine increases the risk of toxicity of other commonly used drugs such as phenytoin, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, propranolol, theophylline, warfarin, and carbamazepine. Elderly patients taking cimetidine are at risk for neuropsychiatric changes, which may be temporarily reversed by physostigmine. Other side effects and indications for use are reviewed.", 
    "43": "The plasma protein binding of diazepam and lidocaine was measured in patients with renal disease (those with uremia, nephrotic syndrome, or who had received a transplant) and in age- and sex- matched control subjects. Percentage unbound diazepam in plasma was increased over control in all three groups of patients as follows: uremic patients 3.23%, control, 1.64% (P less than 0.001), nephrotic patients, 3.55%, control, 1.63% (P less than 0.001); and transplant recipients, 2.11%, control 1.50% (P less than 0.001). The binding ratio (molar concentration of bound to unbound drug) in patients was related to albumin concentration (r = 0.609, P less than 0.001). Percentage of unbound lidocaine did not differ substantially from control in nephrotic patients (34.2%, control 30.8%), but was reduced in the uremic patients (20.8%, control 30.7%, P less than 0.001) and transplant recipients (24.6%, control 33.7%, P less than 0.005). These increases were associated with increases in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentration (uremic patients 134.9 mg/dl, control 66.3, P less than 0.001; transplant recipients 106.5, control 65.6, P less than 0.001). The binding ratio of lidocaine was closely related to the AAG concentration in patients (r = 0.933, P less than 0.001) and controls (r = 0.719, P less than 0.001). Thus, the binding of basic drugs may be increased or decreased in patients with renal disease, depending on the relative contribution of the individual plasma to the total binding and the type of disease.", 
    "44": "During the decade 1968-1978 the Danish Board of Adverse Reactions to Drugs received 572 (6% of the total number) reports on hepatotoxicity. Halothane amounted to one fourth of the reported cases. Among the 94 psychotropic-induced adverse drug reactions 54 cases were attributed to chlorpromazine, 10 to tricyclic antidepressants, and only 2 to benzodiazepines. Considering the drug consumption data, the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is nearly five times more frequently associated with hepatotoxicity than administration of sulfamethizole. Almost two thirds of the hepatotoxic reactions were classified as cytotoxic. Halothane, oxyphenisatin, rifampicin, alfa-methyldopa, papaverine, phenytoin, and ajmaline were almost exclusively related to cytotoxic reactions. Excluding the halothane-induced hepatotoxic reactions, the relative mortality of the cytotoxic (6%) reactions is not significantly different from that of the cholestatic (3%) ones. Thirteen percent of the patients with halothane-induced hepatotoxicity died.", 
    "45": "The effect of three commonly used premedicants and a control on anaesthesia with ICI 35, 868 is described. Two randomized studies were performed--one a group study of induction characteristics at 2 mg kg-1 and the other a detailed study in patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery with an induction dose of 1.5 mg kg-1 and maintenance with incremental doses plus 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Premedication had little effect on the already good induction characteristics. Only heavy opiate premedication produced reliable induction at 1.5 mg kg-1, but with an increase in side-effects. Diazepam appears to be the premedicant of choice, although the overall frequency of pain on injection has not been affected by premedication.", 
    "46": "The activity of some schistosomicidal drugs have been studied by electron microscopy on the tegument of Schistosoma mansoni. Results are different and depend of the compound which is tested. Two new compounds: RO 11 3128 and RO 13 3978 are specially active and act in different ways on the tegument. On of them, a benzodiazepine, have been tested in association with an \"antibenzodiazepine\" compound in order to avoid the sedative action without decrease of the schistosomicidal activity.", 
    "47": "This paper reports a variety of experimental observations which strongly support the assumption that the warfarin binding site, or site I of human serum albumin, is better described as the warfarin-azapropazone binding area, consisting of the overlapping binding sites for warfarin and azapropazone. In general, drugs interacting with one of the two sites will also displace drugs bound to the other site, although their displacing potencies for both sites may vary considerably. This is most pronounced in the case of glibenclamide, which strongly inhibits the binding of drugs to the azapropazone site with only minor effects on drugs bound to the warfarin site. The lone tryptophan residue of human serum albumin, previously shown to be part of the warfarin binding site, is obviously located in the not-overlapping part of the warfarin site, so that its modification affects only the binding of drugs to the warfarin and not to the azapropazone site of this large binding area. The observation of different but overlapping binding sites might explain the fact that the albumin binding of drugs which seem to be bound to similar sites because of their mutual displacement can be affected differently during several disease states.", 
    "48": "It was traditionally assumed that ethanol, as part of an intentional drug overdose, will increase morbidity and mortality. The authors prospectively studied the effect of ethanol on the outcome of intentional drug overdose in 468 adults, 196 of whom required hospital admission. Ethanol was detected in significantly fewer patients who required admission. Ethanol ingestion was not related to coma, impaired vital signs or mortality. Indeed, the duration of coma was significantly shorter in patients in whom ethanol was detected, but this group had a lesser incidence of multiple drug and nonbarbiturate hypnotic ingestion and a greater incidence of chronic ethanol use. Thus, it seems that ethanol is not associated with a worse clinical course if the drug overdose patient reaches medical care before an irreversible event.", 
    "49": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors have been demonstrated recently in a variety of mammalian tissues. However, assay methods for such receptors have required that disrupted tissues be used. We have developed an in situ assay for this receptor utilizing intact cells cultured from the cerebral cortices of fetal mice which is more sensitive and physiologic than those used previously. Results obtained with this assay differ in the following ways from those in which disrupted tissues are used: (1) total and specific BDZ binding was as much as 10-fold higher in the in situ assays; (2) Scatchard analysis of the binding data is consistently nonlinear, revealing at least two binding sites with KD values of 5.5 and 303 nM, and (3) presumed nonneuronal receptors were found in abundance.", 
    "50": "Using a recently developed assay method which maintains cell integrity, we have performed a developmental study of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor on cells of fetal mouse cortex in cultures which were either 'neuron-poor' or 'neuron-rich'. The developmental profile of the BDZ receptor in culture, when assayed on the intact cell, closely mimicked its development in vivo, reaching maximum values at 35-42 days after conception. Further, the time course of development paralleled that reported for GABA neurons both in vivo and in vitro. We have also shown that the relative delay in development of the clonazepam-displaceable portion of BDZ binding approximated a similar delay in the reported development of glutamic acid decarboxylase activity, both parameters presumably reflecting specific neuronal development. Thus, the ontogenesis of specific BDZ receptor binding in culture bears marked similarity to the time course of development of the GABAergic system.", 
    "51": "Analysis of the displacement of 3H-diazepam binding to membranes prepared from the ovine frontal cortex by the triazolopyradiazine CL218,872 yielded a Hill coefficient significantly below unity. By analogy with similar studies of this drug in rat brain this suggested the existence of Types 1 and 2 benzodiazepine receptors. The degree of displacement of 3H-diazepam by CL218,872 (200 nM, Type 1; 800 nM, Type 2) in homogenates of brain regions differed, the rank order being cerebellum greater than parietal cortex greater than frontal cortex congruent to temporal cortex congruent to hippocampus greater than striatum. Displacement of 3H-diazepam by CL218,872 was enhanced by 10(-5) M GABA in the striatum (at 200 nM and 800 nM CL218,872) and cerebellum (at 200 nM CL218,872). Benzodiazepine receptors in the ovine frontal cortex were least sensitive to CL218,872 (200 nM) in young fetuses (54-68 days gestation) and achieved adult levels of sensitivity by late gestation. Finally, the potency of CL218,872 to displace 3H-diazepam was not effected by the 3H-ligand concentration (0.5 nM or 5.0 nM), suggesting that Types 1 and 2 benzodiazepine receptors are not identical to the high and low affinity 3H-diazepam binding sites we have previously identified in the ovine brain.", 
    "52": "We have used the adenosine-stimulated adenylate cyclase of guinea-pig brain to examine the potency of diazepam as an adenosine uptake inhibitor. Diazepam at concentrations in the range 10--500 microM stimulates the production of cAMP in incubated slices of guinea-pig cerebral cortex, with maximal fivefold stimulations over basal levels by 200 microM diazepam. The increases can be largely (but not completely) blocked by the adenosine antagonist theophylline or by addition of excess adenosine deaminase to the system. It appears that the stimulation of cAMP production is due to a blockade of adenosine uptake which results in an increase in extracellular adenosine and concomitant activation of the adenosine receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase. Since the cAMP response to standard adenosine uptake blockers (dipyridamole, dilazep) can be completely blocked by theophylline or adenosine deaminase, a small component of the diazepam response cannot be explained by an adenosine effect. The concentration of diazepam at which the first significant cAMP increase occurs is 10 microM or slightly lower. This is significantly higher than the concentration of diazepam needed to saturate the pharmacologically characterized central nervous system receptors for benzodiazepines.", 
    "53": "Administration of single doses of ethanol or presence of ethanol in the incubation medium does not change 3H-flunitrazepam binding in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. In rats made dependent on ethanol by three daily ethanol administrations for six days and sacrifices 1 hr after the last ethanol dose 3H-flunitrazepam binding is decreased in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. This decrease is present only in membranes preincubated with Triton X-100 and is due to decreased number of binding sites. In rats sacrificed 16 hours after the last chronic ethanol dose the 3H-flunitrazepam binding returns to control levels.", 
    "54": "The existence of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system in human anterior pituitary tissue was examined. Crude membrane fractions prepared from human anterior pituitary tissue bound tritiated GABA. The binding was saturable, and Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site of high affinity (Kd = 40 nM) and a maximum binding of 1.2 pmol/mg protein. Binding was displaced in a dose-related manner by the GABA agonists muscimol (KI = 1 X 10(-8) M), isoguvacine (KI = 6 X 10(-7) M), THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol); KI = 5 X 10(-6) M), and the antagonist (+)bicuculline (KI = 5 X 10(-5) M) but not its inactive stereoisomer (-)bicuculline (KI greater than 10(-3) M). In anterior pituitary tissue, a significant concentration of GABA was found (mean, 2.5 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg protein) but no glutamic acid decarboxylase activity, the enzyme synthesizing GABA, was detected using a highly sensitive assay. In addition, benzodiazepine binding was present. An affinity of approximately 15 nM and a Bmax of approximately 0.75 pmol/mg protein were observed when using [3H]diazepam as the ligand. No saturable clonazepam binding occurred, and only slight GABA stimulation of diazepam binding was observed (mean, 18%; range, 6-38%). The ability of GABA and benzodiazepine to alter PRL secretion in rats suggests that the human pituitary GABA-binding sites described here might also mediate effects on PRL release.", 
    "55": "Metaldehyde, when administered orally to mice at a dose of 1 g kg-1, produced convulsions and death within 2 h. Brain concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) 5-hydroxytryptamie (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were significantly reduced in these animals relative to controls. Treatment with either intraperitoneal clonidine or diazepam 20 min after administration of metaldehyde reduced the mortality rate and in mice surviving for 5 h, the decrease in brain NA and 5-HT concentrations were significantly reduced.", 
    "56": "Halazepam is a new benzodiazepine derivative that is molecularly similar to chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. Animal studies indicated that halazepam produces sedative and antianxiety effects with less toxicity than chlordiazepoxide or diazepam. Computer EEG and somatosensory evoked potential studies demonstrated that halazepam has a significant effect on the EEG, characteristic of changes that occur with benzodiazepines. In initial clinical studies, halazepam exhibited not only anxiolytic properties but also reduced symptoms of depression and had a therapeutic effect on epilepsy. In preliminary, uncontrolled clinical trials, halazepam was effective in ameliorating anxiety and tension in alcoholic and acute schizophrenic patients, with few adverse effects. Later double-blind studies generally demonstrated that halazepam is significantly superior to placebo in alleviating symptoms of anxiety and tension. Most comparative studies indicate that halazepam is equal to or more effective than diazepam with a lower frequency of side effects. Halazepam does not increase hostility and aggression, as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam have been shown to do, and it is effective in both situational and characterologic anxiety. Drowsiness and slight dry mouth are the only side effects reported in more than isolated instances, although geriatric patients may frequently become ataxic with higher doses.", 
    "57": "Diazepam is frequently the subject of review by various agencies and institutions charged with determining whether or not to substitute another, more economical drug--in most instances, chlordiazepoxide. A review of the comparative literature has shown that, on clinical and pharmacokinetic grounds, chlordiazepoxide is not the drug of choice for all clinical indications recommended for the benzodiazepines as a class, particularly for use as an antianxiety agent. There is evidence that the antianxiety effect of chlordiazepoxide is related to the appearance of its two active metabolites, which may explain the observed delay in its onset of action. When chlordiazepoxide's reduced clearance in the elderly and in patients with liver disease is considered along with its limited range of indications, substitution of diazepam with chlordiazepoxide is clearly not reasonable. Diazepam and lorazepam are preferred choices in acute anxiety because they are themselves active anxiolytics. Oxazepam is recommended in alcoholic cirrhotics because its plasma clearance does not seem to be significantly affected by liver disease. Diazepam is recommended for chronic anxiety because of the rapid onset of action of diazepam itself and the smooth transition to the nondrug state via its longer-acting active metabolite.", 
    "58": "The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has initiated a project to develop treatment outlines for various psychiatric disorders. It is envisaged that the present outline, which was developed by a project team and an expert committee may be modified by the College before being used in post graduate and continuing education and in peer review. In its present form it should be of use to practising psychiatrists. Comments and criticisms on this outline are welcome. A loose-leaf insert is included so that interested readers may respond, either directly to the project team or indirectly via the Editor. This is the first of a series of treatment outlines and concerns the diagnosis and treatment of agoraphobia. The next outline will be on the treatment of depressive illness.", 
    "59": "Death has been examined as a possible adverse consequence of the use of benzodiazepine drugs. Rather than limit ourselves to drug overdose cases, we have analyzed unselected blood specimens by a technique sensitive enough to detect therapeutic use as well. The subpopulation thus identified was found to have a number of interesting characteristics not shared by typical coroners' cases. These features are described and discussed in detail in the text.", 
    "60": "The disposition, distribution and the hepatic first-pass effect of pinazepam and its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam was investigated in rats. Pinazepam (20 mg/kg) was orally administered by stomach intubation. Plasma and tissue concentrations of the parent compound and metabolite were measured by GLC analysis. Pinazepam was rapidly absorbed (ka = 2.77 hr-1) and converted into N-desmethyldiazepam, plasma levels of which were higher than those of parent compound shortly after administration. The elimination rate constants were 0.20 hr-1 for pinazepam and 0.69 hr-1 for N-desmethyldiazepam. Liver contained the highest concentrations of both compounds. Brain, lung, heart, and kidney preferentially accumulated pinazepam when compared to the gastrocnemius muscle, which accumulated both compounds poorly. The first-pass effect of pinazepam by the liver was studied by analyzing blood from the portal and hepatic veins in rats. Ten minutes after dosing, the mean plasma concentrations of parent compound and metabolite, respectively, were 367.5 and 22.1 ng/ml in the portal vein and 9.8 and 40.7 ng/ml in the hepatic vein. Therefore, rat liver avidly extracted pinazepam from the blood and rapidly metabolized it into N-desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "61": "Interactions between buprenorphine, narcotic analgesic, and centrally acting drugs were studied in prolongation of halothane-induced sleeping and analgesia using the D'Amour-Smith method in mice, and the effect of buprenorphine on monoamine metabolism was studied in rat brain. Diazepam and chlorpromazine prolonged the halothane-induced sleeping time dose-dependently. Buprenorphine (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg s.c.) inhibited the effect of diazepam, but not that of chlorpromazine. Pentazocine and naloxone also inhibited the effect of diazepam, but morphine did not. It is suggested that the inhibitory effect of buprenorphine on prolongation of halothane-induced sleeping time by diazepam is due to its opiate antagonistic property. Since narcotic antagonists inhibited the effect of diazepam, the endogenous opiate system seems to be involved in this effect. Diazepam or droperidol had no effect on the analgesia of buprenorphine, morphine, and pentazocine. Buprenorphine analgesia was inhibited by reserpine and p-chlorophenylalanine, potentiated by 5-hydroxytryptophan, and not affected by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. These results suggest that the serotonergic system plays a modulating role in buprenorphine analgesia. Imipramine and nialamide inhibited buprenorphine analgesia in the test at low stimulus intensity, but potentiated at high stimulus intensity. Buprenorphine (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg s.c.) increased the dopamine metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, in various brain areas and the serotonin metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in midbrain.", 
    "62": "The physical and psychophysiological effects of an orally administered single dose of 3 mg cloxazolam as compared to 5 mg diazepam and a placebo were investigated for 144 healthy male subjects using a double blind technique. In a pre-experimental test, the Ss were classified as either emotional stabiles or labiles, and in the experimental program of one four and half hour period were tested under either stress or control conditions. In order to create appropriate conditions for testing the tranquilizers, three stress situations that would induce anxiety were used: anticipation of an electric shock, preparation of a public speech and one due to failure in an achievement test. By combining these methods it was possible to sustain for 30 minutes in healthy Ss a state of anxiety or emotional activation which seemed suitable as a model for clinical anxiety. Under 5 mg diazepam rather week, but tranquilizer-typical effects were registered in both subjective and objective measures: an increase in self-confidence in emotional labiles, mood improvement, lower electrodermal responses and tranquilizer-typical EEG-pattern, but also subjective deactivating effects. The HR-increase elicited by anxiety induction was not influenced by Diazepam. Under 3 mg cloxazolam very similar effects to those under diazepam were apparent in the subjective measures; there was however, no mood improvement. Cloxazolam was judged as more strongly deactivating and fatigue inducing than diazepam. Cloxazolam was clearly different from diazepam with respect to its physiological effects, especially showing an obvious heart rate increase in the control group, which requires further investigation."
