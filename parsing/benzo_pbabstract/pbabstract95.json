Robust data suggest that anticholinergic agents, when administered prebronchoscopy, do not produce a clinically meaningful effect, and their use is discouraged. Lidocaine is the preferred topical anesthetic for bronchoscopy, given its short half life and wide margin of safety. The use of a combination of benzodiazepines and opiates is suggested because of their synergistic effects on patient tolerance during the procedure and the added antitussive properties of opioids. Propofol is an effective agent for sedation in bronchoscopy and can achieve similar sedation, amnesia, and patient tolerance when compared with the combined administration of benzodiazepines and opiates.",

    "22": "The GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)R) is expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain and is a target for many therapeutic agents, including general anesthetics and benzodiazepines, which enhance receptor function by increasing the open probability (P(o)) of the ion channel. It is commonplace for in vitro studies of receptor pharmacological characteristics to use negative membrane holding potentials to mimic the resting potential of neurons and symmetrical chloride to eliminate Goldman rectification, which results in chloride flow in the opposite direction, compared with in vivo conditions. This critical difference is usually overlooked because the GABA(A)R has been reported to behave as an ohmic pore, but our results show that the current-voltage relationship is nonlinear with respect to P(o). Specifically, we found that currents were outwardly rectifying at low P(o) and linear at high P(o). We confirmed the correlation between P(o) and rectification with a partial agonist, piperidine-4-sulfonic acid, and a gating-impaired mutation, \u03b11(L277A); both exhibited enhanced outward rectification. Furthermore, this correlation was independent of Goldman rectification and persisted under altered chloride gradient conditions, which suggests that rectification is linked to the direction of chloride flux. Finally, our results showed that the degree of potentiation by general anesthetics (etomidate, propofol, and isoflurane) was greater at negative membrane potentials. Traditional in vitro experiments thus overestimate the action of positive allosteric modulators of the GABA(A)R. Our results show that the direction of the driving force on the permeant ion, as well as P(o), must be considered together for a complete understanding of drug actions on ligand-gated ion channels.",

    "24": "Data on the effect of acutely administered serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in animal anxiety models have been inconsistent. In some of the models these compounds showed anxiolytic properties, while in others they were ineffective or even anxiogenic. In the foot shock-induced ultrasonic vocalization (USV) test in the adult rat, SSRIs were reported to be effective, however, they were only tested with protocols using multiple shocking design. In the present study, anxiolytic effects of various SSRI compounds (sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram) were tested in three distinct USV test protocols in comparison with alprazolam and 8-OH-DPAT. In the single shocking protocol, animals were exposed to one shocking session after the drug treatment. In the multiple shocking protocol, rats went through a foot shock priming session before each drug test. On priming days animals received foot shocks without drug treatment. On the test day (the day after), rats received drug treatment and then were shocked again. In the context conditioning protocol animals were exposed to foot shocks on two consecutive days before the drug test. On the third, test day, after drug treatment animals were replaced to the shocking chamber, but this time shocks were not delivered. SSRIs were ineffective using the single shocking protocol. In the context conditioned protocol, all SSRIs showed linear dose-response relationship with ED50 values of 8.5, 2.2, 0.77 and 0.93 mg/kg i.p. for fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and escitalopram, respectively. Using the multiple shocking protocol, SSRIs were only partially effective with maximum inhibitions ranging between 44% and 62%. In contrast to SSRIs, the benzodiazepine anxiolytics, alprazolam showed anxiolytic activity with linear dose-response relationship in all of the test protocols, with ED50 values varying from 1.3 to 4.0 mg/kg i.p. The serotonin 5HT1A receptor antagonist 8-OH-DPAT also showed linear dose-response relationship in all protocols, but this compound was less potent in the single shocking design (ED50 values were 0.27, 0.04 and 0.07 mg/kg i.p. in the single shocking, multiple shocking and context conditioned protocol, respectively). In conclusion, our results show that priming has a major impact on the effectiveness of SSRIs in the USV test, and the three test protocols applied in this study have different predictive and face validity.", 
    "25": "Ketamine is usually used for murine anesthesia in animal experiments with other anesthetics for its sedation and analgesic effects. However, ketamine was categorized as a narcotic drug in Japan on January 1, 2007. After this act came into effect, a narcotic handling license became necessary for using and possessing ketamine. Pentobarbital sodium, which is also used for laboratory animal experiments as Nembutal, is no longer being manufactured. For these reasons, other anesthetic agents that can be used without a license are needed. In this paper, we examined the use of anesthetics other than ketamine and pentobarbital sodium. A combination anesthetic (M/M/B: 0.3/4/5) was prepared with 0.3 mg/kg of medetomidine, 4.0 mg/kg of midazolam, and 5.0 mg/kg of butorphanol. The anesthetics were administered to male ICR mice by intraperitoneal injection. In order to assess anesthetic depth and duration, we stimulated the mice directly after loss of righting reflexes to recovery of these same reflexes and then recorded four parameters--a tail pinch reflex, a pedal withdrawal reflex in the forelimbs, a pedal withdrawal reflex in the hindlimbs, and corneal reflex. Each parameter was scored, and the anesthetic depth, expressed by the total score, was summed. The surgical anesthesia duration of M/M/B: 0.3/4/5 mg/kg was almost identical to the surgical anesthetic duration with a ketamine and xylazine mixture (80-8 mg/kg). These data suggested that mice can be anesthetized by M/M/B: 0.3/4/5 as an alternate to ketamine. We thus can recommend M/M/B: 0.3/4/5 for murine surgical anesthesia.", 
    "26": "Acute liver failure (ALF) or fulminant hepatic failure represents a serious life-threatening condition. ALF is characterized by a significant liver injury that leads to a rapid onset of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). In ALF, patients manifest rapid deterioration in consciousness leading to hepatic coma together with an onset of brain edema which induces high intracranial pressure that frequently leads to herniation and death. It is well accepted that hyperammonemia is a cardinal, but not the sole, mediator in the pathophysiology of ALF. There is increasing evidence that neurosteroids, including the parent neurosteroid pregnenolone, and the progesterone metabolites tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) accumulate in brain in experimental models of ALF. Neurosteroids in ALF represent good candidates to explain the phenomenon of \"increased GABAergic tone\" in chronic and ALF, and the beneficial effects of benzodiazepine drugs. The mechanisms that trigger brain neurosteroid changes in ALF are not yet well known, but could involve partially de novo neurosteroidogenesis following activation of the translocator protein (TSPO). The factors that contribute to TSPO changes in ALF may include ammonia and cytokines. It is possible that increases in brain levels of neurosteroids in ALF may result in auto-regulatory mechanisms where hypothermia may play a significant role. Possible mechanisms that may involve neurosteroids in the pathophysiology of HE, and more speculatively in brain edema, and inflammatory processes in ALF are suggested.",

Although clonazepam therapy has been widely used due to its efficacy, it is not always effective because of the complexity of BMS pathogenesis. In this study, we have investigated outcome predictors of clonazepam therapy in patients with BMS. One hundred patients with BMS (7 men and 93 women, mean age 58.5 \u00b1 10.8 years) were instructed to take 0.5mg of clonazepam once or twice daily for 4 weeks. The patients were sub-grouped according to psychological status, salivary flow rate, presence of psychiatric medications, symptom area and duration, symptom severity, presence of oral parafunctions, and accompanying oral complaints. The changes in symptoms were analyzed and compared between the sub-groups. Subjects with T-scores \u226450 for each psychological symptom dimension, a greater degree of initial symptoms (visual analog scale (VAS)\u22655), and accompanying oral complaints, such as xerostomia and taste disturbance, displayed greater decreases in symptoms compared with their counterparts. In conclusion, psychological status, initial symptom severity, and the presence of xerostomia and/or taste disturbance can serve as outcome predictors of clonazepam therapy for patients with BMS.",

    "33": "Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels. Ethanol potentiates glycine activation of the GlyR, and putative binding sites for alcohol are located in the transmembrane (TM) domains between and within subunits. To alter alcohol sensitivity of GlyR, we introduced two mutations in the GlyR \u03b11 subunit, M287L (TM3) and Q266I (TM2). After expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, both mutants showed a reduction in glycine sensitivity and glycine-induced maximal currents. Activation by taurine, another endogenous agonist, was almost abolished in the M287L GlyR. The ethanol potentiation of glycine currents was reduced in the M287L GlyR and eliminated in Q266I. Physiological levels of zinc (100 nM) potentiate glycine responses in wild-type GlyR and also enhance the ethanol potentiation of glycine responses. Although zinc potentiation of glycine responses was unchanged in both mutants, zinc enhancement of ethanol potentiation of glycine responses was absent in M287L GlyRs. The Q266I mutation decreased conductance but increased mean open time (effects not seen in M287L). Two lines of knockin mice bearing these mutations were developed. Survival of homozygous knockin mice was impaired, probably as a consequence of impaired glycinergic transmission. Glycine showed a decreased capacity for displacing strychnine binding in heterozygous knockin mice. Electrophysiology in isolated neurons of brain stem showed decreased glycine-mediated currents and decreased ethanol potentiation in homozygous knockin mice. Molecular models of the wild-type and mutant GlyRs show a smaller water-filled cavity within the TM domains of the Q266I \u03b11 subunit. The behavioral characterization of these knockin mice is presented in a companion article (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 340:317-329, 2012).",

In this study the use of liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) was tested as a promising technique for this purpose. In the optimized procedure, 20mg hair were decontaminated with water and acetone and two times extracted by 18h incubation with 0.5ml of a mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/H(2)O/ammonium formate at 37\u00b0C. A mixture of deuterated standards from different drug groups was added for quantification and method control. The united extracts were evaporated to a residue of 0.5ml and 5\u03bcl were injected without clean-up for LC-QTOF-MS measurement (instrument Agilent 6530) with positive electrospray ionization and in data dependent acquisition mode. For peak identification the accurate mass data base and spectral library of the authors was used which contains accurate mass CID spectra of more than 2500 and theoretically calculated accurate mass data of more than 7500 toxicologically relevant substances. Validation at the example of 24 illegal drugs, their metabolites and benzodiazepines resulted in limits of detection of 0.003-0.015ng/mg, and limits of quantification of 0.006-0.021ng/mg with good accuracy and intra- and interday reproducibility. The matrix effect by ion suppression/enhancement was 72-107% for basic drugs and 42-75% for benzodiazepines. Yields of the hair extraction above 90% were determined for 59 drugs or metabolites. The method was applied to hair samples from 30 drug fatalities and from 60 death cases with known therapeutic drug intake at life time. Altogether 212 substances were identified with a frequency per drug of 1-40 (mean 4.2) and per case of 2-33 (mean 10.2), between them 35 illegal drug related substances and 154 therapeutic drugs. Comparison with the data known from case histories and from the analysis of blood, urine and gastric content showed only a low agreement, with many unexpected drugs detected and many reported drugs not detected in hair. Basic drugs and metabolites such as opioides, cocaine, amphetamines, several groups of antidepressants, neuroleptics, beta-blockers or the metamizole metabolite noramidopyrine were found with high frequency whereas acidic and several neutral drugs such as cannabinoids, salicylic acid, furosemide, barbiturates, phenprocoumone or cardiac glycosides could not be detected with sufficient sensitivity, mainly because of the low ion yield of positive ESI for these compounds. The advantage of a comprehensive acquisition of all substances is paid by a lower sensitivity in comparison to targeted screening LC-MS/MS procedures. In conclusion, the procedure of sample preparation and LC-QTOF-MS analysis proved to be a robust and sensitive routine method in which the qualitative screening for a wide variety of toxic substances in hair is combined with the quantitative determination of selected illegal drugs.",

Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic receptors. In this study, we used rodents to investigate whether olanzapine could suppress the hyperlocomotion, rewarding effect, and discriminative stimulus effect induced by the prototypic \u03bc-opioid morphine, which are all considered to reflect the abuse potential or psychoactive effects of \u03bc-opioids. Olanzapine at doses that failed to induce motor coordination produced a dose-dependent reduction in hyperlocomotion induced by morphine in mice. Olanzapine at a dose that did not produce motor dysfunction also inhibited the significant place preference induced by morphine in mice. Furthermore, the discriminative stimulus effect induced by morphine in rats was dose-dependently and significantly attenuated by olanzapine at the dose that did not induce the motor dysfunction. These results suggest that treatment with both \u03bc-opioids and olanzapine at a dose lower than that at which it induces motor dysfunction could be very useful for preventing the abuse potential and/or psychoactive effects of \u03bc-opioids.", 
    "56": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unique amongst psychiatric disorders in two ways. Firstly, there is usually a very clear point of onset- the traumatic event The second unique feature of PTSD is that it is characterized by a failure of the normal response to resolve. Given these two characteristics, PTSD appears a good candidate for secondary prevention, ie, interventions immediately after the trauma. Evidence available starting from current concepts and contemporary research of potential secondary prevention interventions are presented. Common practices in the aftermath of trauma such as debriefing and benzodiazepines need to be carefully considered, taking into account their potential harm to the spontaneous recovery process, and the trajectory of PTSD, and not only judging them according to their immediate (comforting) effects. A discussion of the balance required between aiding recovery but not interfering with the potent natural resolution of symptoms (that is expected in most cases), along with potential avenues of future research, are presented. Results of a small pilot study with a single intervention of hydrocortisone immediately after trauma appear to be promising, and clearly indicate the need for further studies.",

We report two clinical cases of mood disorders: mania and a major depressive episode with psychotic characteristics in two patients with mefloquine antimalarial prophylaxis. FIRST CLINICAL CASE: A 31-year-old man had taken mefloquine at a rate of 250mg/week as malaria prophylaxis for his mission in Democratic Republic of Congo. He developed mania with psychotic symptoms after taking five tablets of 250mg of mefloquine. He exhibited an elevated mood and also developed delusions of grandeur, reference and persecution, with auditory hallucinations. The physical examination and the blood laboratory tests were normal. The patient was treated with an atypical neuroleptic (olanzapine 20mg/d) leading to a complete resolution of symptomatology at the end of 3\u00a0weeks. SECOND CLINICAL CASE: A 27-year-old man presented a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms after 1\u00a0week on his return from a stay in Democratic Republic of Congo, where he had taken mefloquine during 6\u00a0months as malaria prophylaxis (250mg/week). His physical examination and investigations (full blood test, serology and MRN) were normal. The patient was treated with clomipramine (150mg/d) and olanzapine (20mg/d).

Common neuropsychiatric adverse effects of mefloquine can occur in up to 40% of patients, such as dizziness, sleep disturbances, anorexia, ataxia, and fatigue. Other more serious adverse reactions are rare. They are represented primarily by panic attacks, convulsions, acute psychosis, paranoid delusions, suicidal ideation, disorders of mood: major depressive episode and the manic excitation. The incidence of such neuropsychiatric effects is 1/10,000 to 1/15,000 during the prophylactic treatment. The causal mechanism for the side effects is not known. Several risk factors increasing the neurotoxicity of mefloquine can be identified, the patient with personal or family history of psychiatric disorders are more frequently concerned. Alcohol and the association with other drugs (like quinine) are two other risk factors.",

We also present the elements to take in account for the best drug choice at the end of pregnancy and/or for an adapted advice if the drug has been already taken: the drug itself (pharmacological effects, kinetics in neonate, toxicity marker, risk detection tool), drug amount possibly received by the neonate and literature data about neonatal manifestations due to the drug.", 
    "62": "Sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHH) have been widely used for in vitro assessments of biliary clearance. However, the modulation of metabolism enzymes has not been fully evaluated in this system. The present study was therefore undertaken to determine the activity of cytochrome P450 (P450) 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A and to evaluate the impact of 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) on hepatic uptake and biliary excretion in SCHH. The SCHH maintained integrity and viability as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assays conducted over the culture period. Although all assessed P450 activity decreased in day 2 SCHH, the extent of the decrease and the subsequent rebound in activity varied across the different isoforms. Day 5 CYP1A2 activity was approximately 2.5-fold higher than day 1 activity, whereas the CYP3A and CYP2C9 activities were 90 and 60% of the day 1 levels, respectively. In contrast, the initial CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 activity losses did not rebound over the 5-day culture period. Furthermore, ABT was not found to have an effect, whether directly or indirectly as a P450 inactivator, with respect to the hepatic transport of rosuvastatin, atrovastatin, and midazolam in SCHH. Taken together, these results suggest that the SCHH model is a reliable tool to characterize hepatic uptake and biliary excretion. Due to the differential modulation of P450 activity, SCHH may not be considered a suitable tool for metabolic stability assessments with compounds predominantly cleared by certain P450 enzymes.", 
    "63": "Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is severe, disabling and chronic intraoral pain condition for which no local or systemic cause can be found and clinical examination is normal. It mostly affects elderly citizens, especially postmenopausal women with prevalence up to 12-18%. In addition to spontaneous burning pain, patients may complain of taste alterations. Recent neurophysiologic, psychophysical, neuropathological, and functional imaging studies have elucidated that several neuropathic mechanisms, mostly subclinical, act at different levels of the neuraxis and contribute to the pathophysiology of primary BMS. Demonstration of loss of small diameter nerve fibres in the tongue epithelium explains thermal hypoesthesia and increase in taste detection thresholds found in quantitative sensory testing. As in neuropathic pain, decreased brain activation to heat stimuli has been demonstrated with fMRI in BMS patients. However, it seems that the clinical diagnosis of primary BMS encompasses at least three distinct, subclinical neuropathic pain states that may overlap in individual patients. The first subgroup (50-65%) is characterized by peripheral small diameter fibre neuropathy of intraoral mucosa. The second subgroup (20-25%) consists of patients with subclinical lingual, mandibular, or trigeminal system pathology that can be dissected with careful neurophysiologic examination but is clinically indistinguishable from the other two subgroups. The third subgroup (20-40%) fits the concept of central pain that may be related to hypofunction of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. The neurogenic factors acting in these subgroups differ, and will require different treatment strategies. In the future, with proper use of diagnostic tests, BMS patients may benefit from interventions specifically targeted at the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.",

Like propofol, the compound potentiates inhibitory GABA(A) receptor current responses and allosterically modulates binding to both agonist and benzodiazepine sites, assayed on heterologously expressed GABA(A) receptors. p-4-AziC5-Pro inhibits excitatory current responses of nACh receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and photoincorporates into native nACh receptor-enriched Torpedo membranes. Thus, p-4-AziC5-Pro is a functional general anesthetic that both modulates and photoincorporates into Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels, making it an excellent candidate for use in identifying propofol binding sites.", 
    "73": "Decrease of GABAergic transmission has been proposed to improve memory functions. Indeed, inverse agonists selective for \u03b15 GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptors (\u03b15IA) have promnesiant activity. Interestingly, we have recently shown that \u03b15IA can rescue cognitive deficits in Ts65Dn mice, a Down syndrome mouse model with altered GABAergic transmission. Here, we studied the impact of chronic treatment with \u03b15IA on gene expression in the hippocampus of Ts65Dn and control euploid mice after being trained in the Morris water maze task. In euploid mice, chronic treatment with \u03b15IA increased IEGs expression, particularly of c-Fos and Arc genes. In Ts65Dn mice, deficits of IEGs activation were completely rescued after treatment with \u03b15IA. In addition, normalization of Sod1 overexpression in Ts65Dn mice after \u03b15IA treatment was observed. IEG expression regulation after \u03b15IA treatment following behavioral stimulation could be a contributing factor for both the general promnesiant activity of \u03b15IA and its rescuing effect in Ts65Dn mice alongside signaling cascades that are critical for memory consolidation and cognition.",

The hydrazonoyl chloride, the precursor of the cycloadduct, is accessed easily through a two-step reaction carried out in one-pot. It is then used without purification for the base induced formation of the nitrilimine, which undergoes subsequent in situ intramolecular cycloaddition with an alkyne to afford the desired product. The reaction protocol has also been applied in bis-heteroannulation and in the synthesis of uracil derivatives of biological interest. The operational simplicity of the process, the use of cheap starting materials, and the relatively short reaction times required make the process convenient and practical.",

Although macaque species such as the rhesus and cynomolgus macaque are often used for such studies, availability and disease transmission raise concerns over their use. The present study investigated whether the African green monkey might function as a suitable alternative by evaluating operant performance on a DMTS task and comparing this species' response to some commonly used drugs (0.025-0.075 mg/kg physostigmine, 0.0033-0.03 mg/kg scopolamine, 0.014-0.44 mg/kg atropine, 0.125-1.0 mg/kg midazolam, and 0.125-2.0 mg/kg diazepam) to the responses previously reported in macaques. Results demonstrated that African green monkeys are capable of learning and performing a DMTS task, and dose-effect functions for behavioral pharmacology were quite similar to those reported for rhesus macaques and other nonhuman primate species. Thus, the African green monkey may function as a suitable alternative to macaque species in behavioral pharmacology research.",

Thirty-five patients of the main group received non-benzodiazepine tranquilizer adaptol in dose 500 mg 2 times daily in addition to regular vasoactive treatment and 33 patients of the control group received only regular treatment. The following characteristics were assessed at baseline and after 1 month of treatment: complaints and neurological status, anxiety level (the Spielberger-Khanin scale), quality of life (SF-36) and parameters of P300 cognitive evoked potentials. To the end of treatment, there were the significant decrease of state and trait anxiety, improvement of quality of life, decrease of P300 latencies and increase of P300 amplitudes. No significant side-effects were seen, only 2 (5.7%) patients had transitory dyspepsia.

    "78": "The effects of repeated, intermittent administration of a moderate dose of ethanol (3.4 g/kg/day \u00d7 6 days, intragastrically via gavages) on cognitive function were examined in male Wistar rats. No significant differences in weight gain between the ethanol- and water-treated rats were found. Analysis of physical dependence revealed no signs of spontaneous withdrawal, whereas withdrawal signs exacerbated by Ro15-4513, an inverse benzodiazepine agonist, were apparent 5 hours but not 24 hours after the cessation of ethanol treatment. Spatial learning and memory, as assessed in the Barnes maze, were impaired 3-6 days following the treatment but recovered by the 11th-14th days. Reversal learning, however, was impaired throughout the 2-week observation period. Thus, bouts of moderate-dose ethanol administration transiently impair spatial learning and memory, and promote cognitive inflexibility. The employed ethanol exposure paradigm may provide a model of human cognitive deficits associated with alcohol binge drinking.", 
    "79": "In this article, the authors demonstrate a time-series analysis based on a hierarchical Bayesian model of a Poisson outcome with an excessive number of zeroes. The motivating example for this analysis comes from the intensive care unit (ICU) of an urban university teaching hospital (New Haven, Connecticut, 2002-2004). Studies of medication use among older patients in the ICU are complicated by statistical factors such as an excessive number of zero doses, periodicity, and within-person autocorrelation. Whereas time-series techniques adjust for autocorrelation and periodicity in outcome measurements, Bayesian analysis provides greater precision for small samples and the flexibility to conduct posterior predictive simulations. By applying elements of time-series analysis within both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, the authors evaluate differences in shift-based dosing of medication in a medical ICU. From a small sample and with adjustment for excess zeroes, linear trend, autocorrelation, and clinical covariates, both frequentist and Bayesian models provide evidence of a significant association between a specific nursing shift and dosing level of a sedative medication. Furthermore, the posterior distributions from a Bayesian random-effects Poisson model permit posterior predictive simulations of related results that are potentially difficult to model.", 
    "80": "The authors examined driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) cases which were found to be positive in whole blood for cannabis in Finland from 2006 to 2008. Factors studied were the number of cases positive for any combination of \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the metabolites 11-hydroxy-\u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-OH) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). Concurrent use of amphetamines, benzodiazepines and/or alcohol was also recorded, as well as the drivers' age and gender. Altogether 2957 cannabis positive cases were retrieved from the database of the Alcohol and Drug Analytics Unit, National Institute for Health and Welfare. Drug findings were examined in relation to the zero-tolerance policy operated towards DUID in Finland. The number of cannabis positive cases in each year was approximately 1000 and the main demographic of cases was males aged 20-30 years. In the majority of cases (51.6%) the inactive metabolite THC-COOH was the only indication of cannabis use, however, associated use of amphetamines (58.8% of all cases) and/or benzodiazepines (63.9%) in cannabis positive drivers was very common. Detections for amphetamines and/or benzodiazepines were especially common in drivers with THC-COOH only (92.8% of these cases). Combined use of alcohol (25.7%) was also prevalent. Suspect DUID cases generally arise from suspicion on behalf of the police and the zero-tolerance policy offers an expedient means to deal with the challenges presented in DUID, particularly in view of the high incidence of multiple drug use - the legislation is not unduly punitive when enforced in this manner.",

Sedation with 2% propofol was used in all procedures without assisted ventilation and was administered, monitored, and controlled by electrophysiologists. Primary outcome measures were adverse sedative affects including (i) respiratory depression (SpO(2)< 90% for >20 s) and (ii) persistent hypotension [systolic blood pressure (SBP)<90 mmHg at minimum sedation level]. Secondary endpoints included full recovery within 60 min and procedural complications. Of 1000 ablations, 506 ablations were performed for persistent and 494 for paroxysmal AF. Average patient age was 60.1 \u00b1 11.3 years (72.3% male). Propofol was commenced in all patients at a mean infusion rate of 18.5 \u00b1 4.8 mL/h with a mean baseline SBP of 140.3 \u00b1 19.9 mmHg. Mean procedure time was 148.7 \u00b1 57.7 min. Adverse sedative effects necessitating cessation of propofol and switch to midazolam bolus sedation occurred in 15.6% of patients (13.6% due to persistent hypotension, 1.9% due to respiratory depression, and 0.1% due to hypersalivation). Patients who had persistent hypotension were older (62.9 \u00b1 11.2 vs. 60.0 \u00b1 11.4 years, P= 0.011) and more likely to be female (39.5 vs. 23.7%, P< 0.001) than those who tolerated propofol. Patient age correlated to maximum blood pressure drop with propofol (R(2)= 0.101, P< 0.001) and inversely correlated to mean propofol infusion rate (R(2)= 0.066, P< 0.001). No procedures were abandoned due to adverse effects of sedation. All patients recovered within 60 min. Serious procedural complications, unrelated to sedation, occurred in 0.5%, all of whom had pericardial tamponade successfully treated with percutaneous pericardiocentesis.",

    "84": "Lorazepam is a strong sedative for intensive care patients and a commonly used method of administering it to the patient is by infusion of a freshly prepared lorazepam solution. During lorazepam infusion often unwanted lorazepam crystallization occurs, resulting in line obstruction and reduced lorazepam concentrations. With the aid of solubility measurements a solid-liquid phase diagram for lorazepam in mixtures of a commercially available lorazepam solution and an aqueous glucose solution was determined. This confirmed that the glucose solution acts as an anti-solvent, greatly reducing the lorazepam solubility in the infusion solution. Three approaches are proposed to obtain stable lorazepam solutions upon mixing both solutions and thus to prevent crystallization during infusion: (1) using a high lorazepam concentration, and thus a lower glucose solution volume fraction, in the mixed solution; (2) using an elevated temperature during solution preparation and administration; (3) reducing the lorazepam concentration in the commercial lorazepam solution.",

With experimental models using test such as potentiation of diazepam-induced sleeping time, locomotor activity, motor coordination, exploratory behavior pattern, elevated plus maze and maximal electroshock convulsions. Diazepam at doses of 5, 4, and 1 mg/kg served as standard.", 
    "106": "Results showed that the ethanolic extract of L. nodifl ora at both doses (250 and 500 mg/kg p.o.) and its chloroform extract at a higher dose of 500 mg/kg produced central inhibitory (sedative) effects, anticonvulsant effect and anxiolytic effect in mice. Values were statistically significant (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) when compared to the control group. The petroleum ether extract of plant at both dose levels (250 and 500 mg/kg p.o.) did not produce any central effects.", 
    "107": "In conclusion, we can say that the ethanolic and chloroform extracts showed the central inhibitory activity due to the presence of fl avonoids and this fact was also supported by the finding that the petroleum ether extract did not show any central effect and flavonoids were not found in it.", 
    "108": "A large number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) show varying degrees of basal or constitutive activity. This constitutive activity is usually minimal in natural receptors but is markedly observed in wild type and mutated (naturally or induced) receptors. According to conventional two-state drug receptor interaction model, binding of a ligand may initiate activity (agonist with varying degrees of positive intrinsic activity) or prevent the effect of an agonist (antagonist with zero intrinsic activity). Inverse agonists bind with the constitutively active receptors, stabilize them, and thus reduce the activity (negative intrinsic activity). Receptors of many classes (\u03b1-and \u03b2-adrenergic, histaminergic, GABAergic, serotoninergic, opiate, and angiotensin receptors) have shown basal activity in suitable in vitro models. Several drugs that have been conventionally classified as antagonists (\u03b2-blockers, antihistaminics) have shown inverse agonist effects on corresponding constitutively active receptors. Nearly all H(1) and H(2) antihistaminics (antagonists) have been shown to be inverse agonists. Among the \u03b2-blockers, carvedilol and bucindolol demonstrate low level of inverse agonism as compared to propranolol and nadolol. Several antipsychotic drugs (D(2) receptors antagonist), antihypertensive (AT(1) receptor antagonists), antiserotoninergic drugs and opioid antagonists have significant inverse agonistic activity that contributes partly or wholly to their therapeutic value. Inverse agonism may also help explain the underlying mechanism of beneficial effects of carvedilol in congestive failure, naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in opioid dependence, clozapine in psychosis, and candesartan in cardiac hypertrophy. Understanding inverse agonisms has paved a way for newer drug development. It is now possible to develop agents, which have only desired therapeutic value and are devoid of unwanted adverse effect. Pimavanserin (ACP-103), a highly selective 5-HT(2A) inverse agonist, attenuates psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease with psychosis and is devoid of extrapyramidal side effects. This dissociation is also evident from the development of anxioselective benzodiazepines devoid of habit-forming potential. Hemopressin is a peptide ligand that acts as an antagonist as well as inverse agonist. This agent acts as an antinociceptive agent in different in vivo models of pain. Treatment of obesity by drugs having inverse agonist activity at CB(1/2) receptors is also underway. An exciting development is evaluation of \u03b2-blockers in chronic bronchial asthma-a condition akin to congestive heart failure where \u03b2-blockade has become the standard mode of therapy. Synthesis and evaluation of selective agents is underway. Therefore, inverse agonism is an important aspect of drug-receptor interaction and has immense untapped therapeutic potential.",

On day 41 of life after nine separate surgical interventions, the patient's pain scores increased and remained elevated, despite increasing opioid administration. The patient also developed hyperalgesia, allodynia, and photophobia and became extremely irritable upon handling. Other possible causes were excluded, including interruption to opioid delivery, sepsis, acid-base and electrolyte disturbance, and ongoing surgical pathology. An opioid rotation to hydromorphone was initiated and ketamine was commenced. Sedation for ventilation was achieved with dexmedetomidine and midazolam infusions. Over a period of 24 h after opioid de-escalation, pain scores reduced rapidly and the patient became significantly less irritable with handling.

Forty-five (male/female: 19/26) patients with schizophrenia were treated with aripiprazole after a washout period of at least 3 days. There was no concomitant psychotropic except benzodiazepines for insomnia. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to measure the clinical response at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 6. Blood was drawn at week 6 to measure the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole. Patients with a PANSS score that decreased by more than 20% were defined as responders after 6 weeks of treatment.

    "132": "The influence on drug incorporation of melanin affinity, lipophilicity, and membrane permeability is of paramount importance. Despite their high lipophilicity, some drugs have quite low incorporation rate into hair, suggesting that the higher incorporation rates of basic drugs (cocaine, amphetamines.) than neutral (steroids, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids\u2026) or acidic ones are strongly related to the penetrating ability of the drug to break through the membrane based on the pH gradient between blood and the acidic hair matrix. When using hair analysis as a matrix during investigative analysis, e.g. workplace drug testing, doping, driving under the influence, drug-facilitated crime, the question of importance is to know whether the analytical procedure was sensitive enough to identify traces of drugs; this is particularly important when the urine sample(s) of the subject was positive and the hair sample(s) was negative. It has been accepted in the forensic community that a negative hair result cannot exclude the administration of a particular drug, or one of its precursors and the negative findings should not overrule a positive urine result. Nevertheless, the negative hair findings can, on occasion, cast doubt on the positive urine analysis, resulting in substantial legal debate and various consequences for the subject. The concept of minimal detectable dosage in hair is of interest to document the negative findings, but limited data is currently available in the scientific literature. Such data includes cocaine, codeine, ketamine, some benzodiazepines and some unusual compounds. Until laboratories will have sensitive enough methodologies to detect a single use of drug, care should be taken to compare urine and hair findings.", 
    "133": "The present study investigated the interaction between the vanilloid and GABAergic systems on anxiety. Swiss mice were subjected to social interaction test, an animal model for assessing anxiety-related behavior, after intracerebroventricular administration of capsaicin, (TRPV1 agonist) or capsazepine, (TRPV1 antagonist) either alone or in combination with traditional anxiolytic drug, diazepam. Results showed that capsaicin (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg/mouse) decreased the interaction time exhibiting an anxiogenic-like response, while capsazepine (10, and 100 \u03bcg/mouse) produced anxiolytic-like response similar to that of diazepam (0.25-4 mg/kg, i.p). Prior administration of capsaicin at a dose, inactive per se (0.1 \u03bcg/mouse) attenuated the anxiolytic effect of diazepam, whereas, co-administration of capsazepine and diazepam both in their sub-effective as well as effective doses exhibited significant anxiolytic-like effect. Interestingly, the combined treatment of diazepam (2mg/kg) and capsazepine (100\u03bcg/mouse) produced no sedative or locomotor deficit effects. On the contrary, a higher dose of diazepam (>2mg/kg) alone was found to be a sedative or locomotor depressant, indicating that the anxiolytic effect of diazepam, at least in part involve TRPV1 receptor. Morever, capsazepine pretreatment blocked the anxiogenic effect of capsaicin (1, and 100 \u03bcg/mouse). Taken together, these findings suggest that blockade of TRPV1 might be a functional tool to prevent the risks associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines.",

We investigated this phenomenon by studying interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the second synaptic layer of the mouse retina. We found that these interactions showed activity-dependent changes that enhanced signaling of dynamic stimuli. Excitatory signaling from cone bipolar cells to ganglion cells exhibited strong synaptic depression, attributable to reduced glutamate release from bipolar cells. This depression was relieved by amacrine cell inhibitory feedback that activated presynaptic GABA(C) receptors. We found that the balance between excitation and feedback inhibition depended on stimulus frequency; at short interstimulus intervals, excitation was enhanced, attributable to reduced inhibitory feedback. This dynamic interplay may enrich visual processing by enhancing retinal responses to closely spaced temporal events, representing rapid changes in the visual environment.",

The use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants is associated with some health and public safety problems. Decreased of attention, concentration, reflexes, visual capacity, motor coordination and reasoning, associated with increased reaction time and lack of awareness of driving impairment among these drug users, contributes to the increased risk on traffic safety linked with these drugs. This risk may further increase with non-compliance of medical prescription, drug abuse or concomitant use of alcohol. The relationship between the use of psychoactive drugs and road traffic safety is, however, an extremely complex subject and has a primordial importance in the clarification of the role of benzodiazepine and antidepressant effects on driving skills.

There was consensus about the importance of ensuring that clinicians understood the distinction between antimanic efficacy and sedation. Most acutely manic patients may require night-time sedation, but continuous daytime sedation is not necessarily indicated and may interfere with long-term compliance. If sedation is necessary, guidelines recommend the use of adjunctive benzodiazepines only for a short-time.",

Although clinical trials may not represent all patient subpopulations, they show that aripiprazole is well tolerated and has a long-term stabilizing potential. The successful use of aripiprazole rests on using the appropriate initial dose, titrating and adjusting the dose as needed and using appropriate concomitant medication to minimize any short-term adverse events. Low incidence of sedation makes aripiprazole a reasonable long-term treatment choice. If short-term sedation is required an adjunctive sedative agent can be added and removed when no longer needed. Clinical considerations should influence treatment choice, and a better distinction between sedation and antimanic effects should be an educational target aimed to overcome potential barriers for using non-sedative antimanic agents such as aripiprazole.",

Chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regression were used to compare demographic, clinical, and healthcare cost data stratified by length of continuation. Early discontinuation was defined as continuation \u226430 days.

Benzodiazepines are also abused for recreational purposes and the number of benzodiazepine abusers is unfortunately increasing. Within weeks of chronic use, tolerance to the pharmacological effects can develop and withdrawal becomes apparent once the drug is no longer available, which are both conditions indicative of benzodiazepine dependence. Diagnosis of addiction (i.e. compulsive use despite negative consequences) may follow in vulnerable individuals. Here, we review the historical and current use of benzodiazepines from their original synthesis, discovery and commercialisation to the recent identification of the molecular mechanism by which benzodiazepines induce addiction. These results have identified the mechanisms underlying the activation of midbrain dopamine neurons by benzodiazepines, and how these drugs can hijack the mesocorticolimbic reward system. Such knowledge calls for future developments of new receptor subtype specific benzodiazepines with a reduced addiction liability.",

The risk is further increased when antipsychotics are taken in conjunction with anticholinergics. A 27-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder and depression presented to the emergency department with 6 days of constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, and nonbloody vomiting. He later developed multiple episodes of hematochezia and fever. Within the preceding 2 weeks, his medication regimen of divalproex sodium, aripiprazole, and trihexyphenidyl, had been changed to olanzapine, benztropine, and bupropion. The patient's physical examination showed diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, and distension and laboratory tests revealed a leukocytosis. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed colitis extending from the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon, without evidence of perforation. A colonoscopy revealed severe ischemic colitis involving the descending and sigmoid colon, which was confirmed on biopsy. Given the temporal association between the new medications and onset of symptoms, the patient's ischemic colitis was likely caused by olanzapine or the combination of olanzapine and benztropine, likely secondary to their anticholinergic properties. Thus, providers should take a thorough history and counsel patients regarding the risks of constipation when starting antipsychotic medications, particularly those with anticholinergic activity. Despite the fact that ischemic colitis is such a rare adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, it is important to consider because of its potentially fatal outcomes.",

    "203": "The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of complex samples such as biological fluid extracts is widespread when searching for new biomarkers as in metabolomics. The success of this hyphenation resides in the orthogonality of both separation techniques. However, there are frequent cases where compounds are co-eluting and the resolving power of mass spectrometry (MS) is not sufficient (e.g., isobaric compounds and interfering isotopic clusters). Different strategies are discussed to solve these cases and a mixture of eight compounds (i.e., bromazepam, chlorprothixene, clonapzepam, fendiline, flusilazol, oxfendazole, oxycodone, and pamaquine) with identical nominal mass (i.e., m/z 316) is taken to illustrate them. Among the different approaches, high-resolution mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography (i.e., UHPLC) can easily separate these compounds. Another technique, mostly used with low resolving power MS analyzers, is differential ion mobility spectrometry (DMS), where analytes are gas-phase separated according to their size-to-charge ratio. Detailed investigations of the addition of different polar modifiers (i.e., methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol) into the transport gas (nitrogen) to enhance the peak capacity of the technique were carried out. Finally, a complex urine sample fortified with 36 compounds of various chemical properties was analyzed by real-time 2D separation LC\u00d7DMS-MS(/MS). The addition of this orthogonal gas-phase separation technique in the LC-MS(/MS) hyphenation greatly improved data quality by resolving composite MS/MS spectra, which is mandatory in metabolomics when performing database generation and search.",

Recently, we described a series of powerful HDACi characterized by a 1,4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) ring hybridized with a linear alkyl chain bearing a hydroxamate function as Zn(++)--chelating group. Here, we explored the anti-leukaemic properties of three novel hybrids, namely the chiral compounds (S)-2 and (R)-2, and their non-chiral analogue 4, which were first comparatively tested in promyelocytic NB4 cells. (S)-2 and partially 4--but not (R)-2--caused G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest by up-regulating cyclin G2 and p21 expression and down-regulating cyclin D2 expression, and also apoptosis as assessed by cell morphology and cytofluorimetric assay, histone H2AX phosphorylation and PARP cleavage. Notably, these events were partly prevented by an anti-oxidant. Moreover, novel HDACi prompted p53 and \u03b1-tubulin acetylation and, consistently, inhibited HDAC1 and 6 activity. The rank order of potency was (S)-2 > 4 > (R)-2, reflecting that of other biological assays and addressing (S)-2 as the most effective compound capable of triggering apoptosis in various acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines and blasts from patients with different AML subtypes. Importantly, (S)-2 was safe in mice (up to 150 mg/kg/week) as determined by liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow histopathology; and displayed negligible affinity for peripheral/central BDZ-receptors. Overall, the BDZ-hydroxamate (S)-2 showed to be a low-toxic HDACi with powerful anti-proliferative and pro-apototic activities towards different cultured and primary AML cells, and therefore of clinical interest to support conventional anti-leukaemic therapy.", 
    "224": "Dual process models suggest that recognition memory is supported by familiarity and recollection processes. Previous research administering amnesic drugs and measuring ERPs during recognition memory have provided evidence for separable neural correlates of familiarity and recollection. This study examined the effect of midazolam-induced amnesia on memory for details and the proposed ERP correlates of recognition. Midazolam or saline was administered while subjects studied oriented pictures of common objects. ERPs were recorded during a recognition test 1 day later. Subjects' discrimination of old and new pictures as well as orientation discrimination was worse when they were given midazolam instead of saline. As predicted, the parietal old/new effect was decreased with the administration of midazolam. However, weaker effects on FN400 old/new effects were also observed. These results provide converging pharmacological and electrophysiological evidence that midazolam primarily affects recollection as indexed by parietal ERP old/new effects and memory for orientation, while also exerting some weaker effects on familiarity as indexed by FN400 old/new effects.", 
    "225": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) \u03b4 waves during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) after sleep deprivation are enhanced. That observation eventually led to the use of EEG \u03b4 power as a parameter to model process S in the two-process model of sleep. It works remarkably well as a model parameter because it often co-varies with sleep duration and intensity. Nevertheless there is a large volume of literature indicating that EEG \u03b4 power is regulated independently of sleep duration. For example, high amplitude EEG \u03b4 waves occur in wakefulness after systemic atropine administration or after hyperventilation in children. Human neonates have periods of sleep with an almost flat EEG. Similarly, elderly people have reduced EEG \u03b4 power, yet retain substantial NREMS. Rats provided with a cafeteria diet have excess duration of NREMS but simultaneously decreased EEG \u03b4 power for days. Mice challenged with influenza virus have excessive EEG \u03b4 power and NREMS. In contrast, if mice lacking TNF receptors are infected, they still sleep more but have reduced EEG \u03b4 power. Sleep regulatory substances, e.g., IL1, TNF, and GHRH, directly injected unilaterally onto the cortex induce state-dependent ipsilateral enhancement of EEG \u03b4 power without changing duration of organism sleep. IL1 given systemically enhances duration of NREMS but reduces EEG \u03b4 power in mice. Benzodiazepines enhance NREMS but inhibit EEG \u03b4 power. If duration of NREMS is an indicator of prior sleepiness then simultaneous EEG \u03b4 power may or may not be a useful index of sleepiness. Finally, most sleep regulatory substances are cerebral vasodilators and blood flow affects EEG \u03b4 power. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that a single EEG measure will be reliable as a marker of sleepiness for all conditions.", 
    "226": "In the present study, we examined the anxiolytic-like effects of (1R,2R,3R,5R,6R)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)-6fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (MGS0039), a mGluR2/3 antagonist, in the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats. MGS0039 administered at the doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg ip (yet not at 3 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects in this test. Diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg) was used as a reference drug. In the second part of our experiment, MGS0039 was tested at an effective dose of 2 mg/kg after a mixed injection with ritanserin (5-HT(2A/C) receptor antagonist) and WAY100635 (5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist) or flumazenil (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), and all of the compounds were found to attenuate the effect of MGS0039. The above results indicate that the mGluR2/3 antagonist MGS0039 may play a role in the therapy of anxiety and that its action may be mediated by serotonin and the GABAergic systems.", 
    "227": "To investigate the effects of tissue stretch and muscarinic receptor stimulation on the spontaneous activity of the urothelium/lamina propria and identify the specific receptor subtype mediating these responses.", 
    "228": "Isolated strips of porcine urothelium with lamina propria were set up for in vitro recording of contractile activity. Muscarinic receptor subtype-selective antagonists were used to identify the receptors influencing the contractile rate responses to stretch and stimulation with carbachol.", 
    "229": "Isolated strips of urothelium with lamina propria developed spontaneous contractions (3.7 cycles/min) that were unaffected by tetrodotoxin, N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine, or indomethacin. Carbachol (1 \u03bcM) increased the spontaneous contractile rate of these tissue strips by 122% \u00b1 27% (P < .001). These responses were significantly depressed in the presence of the M3-selective muscarinic antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (10-30 nM) but were not affected by the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine (30-100 nM) or the M2-selective antagonist methoctramine (0.1-1 \u03bcM). Stretching of the tissue also caused an increase in the spontaneous contractile rate, and these responses were abolished by atropine (1 \u03bcM) and low concentrations of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (10 nM). Darifenacin, oxybutynin, tolterodine, and solifenacin (1 \u03bcM) all significantly depressed the frequency responses to carbachol (1 \u03bcM).", 
    "230": "The urothelium with the lamina propria exhibits a spontaneous contractile activity that is increased during stretch. The mechanism appears to involve endogenous acetylcholine release acting on M3 muscarinic receptors. Anticholinergic drugs used clinically depress the responses of these tissues, and this mechanism might represent an additional site of action for these drugs in the treatment of bladder overactivity.", 
    "231": "New anthramycin-type analogues, designated usabamycin A-C (1, 2 and 3), have been isolated from cultures of Streptomyces sp. NPS853, a bacterium found in marine sediments. The structures of the new compounds were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses including 1D- and 2D-NMR ((1)H-(1)H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) experiments. The usabamycins show weak inhibition of HeLa cell growth and selective inhibition of serotonin (5-hydroxytrypamine) 5-HT(2B) uptake.", 
    "232": "Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) occurs in patients with SE when they fail to respond to traditional medical therapy. Because there are very few case reports of topiramate (TPM) treatment of RSE in adult patients, we examined our experience with TPM with regard to its safety and efficacy in seizure termination in RSE in an adult patient population. We report a retrospective review of 35 adult patients with RSE who were treated with TPM in addition to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) between 2003 and 2010. After failure of initial treatments of benzodiazepines and weight-based intravenous loading doses of standard AEDs, TPM tablets were crushed and administered via nasogastric tube. Data were collected on age, gender, history of epilepsy, etiology of RSE, daily dose of TPM, co-therapeutic agents, treatment response, and disposition. Following initiation of TPM use and discontinuation of continuous intravenous anesthetics with no additional AEDs administered, cumulative cessation of RSE in patients was 4/35 (11%) at one day, 10/35 (29%) at two days, and 14/35 (40%) at three days. However, when including all patients and comparing the two patient groups in which RSE was or was not terminated within three days of initiating TPM as the last or not last AED given, there was no significant difference. Time to TPM response was not associated with the type of seizures, etiology of SE, or whether there was a history of epilepsy. There were no documented side effects or complications of therapy with TPM. This study provides support for the use of TPM as an adjunctive agent in the treatment of RSE."
