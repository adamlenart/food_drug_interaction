    "0": "Substances and drugs with powerful psychotropic effects have come into common use during the past decade. Involvement with these substances can range from benign to tragic experiences. Such use may include: experimental, social or recreational use, long-term habituation, toxic reactions, medical-psychologic complications, overdose, and death. Although clinicians tend to analyze and explain many patterns of drug use in terms of various psychodynamic, sociologic and behavioral theories, all of these perspectives begin with the biological and pharmacological effects produced by the various drugs. During the assessment process, the clinician can avoid much confusion by learning to differentiate between the direct pharmacological effects and the diverse psychological and behavioral effects of the drug(s) or substances(s) in question. In order to make these distinctions, a foundation in the \"biological basics\" is essential. This paper presents a strategy for learning the direct tropic effects produced by various drugs. This approach organizes commonly used drugs into six basic categories reflecting the primary action of each: narcotics and related analgesics; sedative-hypnotics (including barbiturates, non-barbiturate sedatives, minor tranquilizers and alcohol); stimulants (including amphetamines, cocaine, and others); hallucinogens; and others like phencyclidine, cannabis and inhalants, which do not readily fit the other categories.", 
    "1": "A total of 237 healthy subjects were studied in four placebo-controlled double-blind trials with parallel treatment groups. The subjects ingested a capsule (diazepam or placebo) and decaffeinated coffee with or without added caffeine or theophylline. Diazepam (10 and 20 mg) impaired dose dependently cognitive skills as measured by digit symbol substitution and letter cancellation, the balance of extraocular muscles, flicker fusion, and tapping speed. With diazepam 10 mg statistically significant effects were seen on digit symbols and exophoria only. Theophylline (10 mg/kg) increased tapping speed and heart rate, whereas other objective measurements were negative for the effects of theophylline or caffeine (250 and 500 mg) alone. Subjectively they reduced calmness, and caffeine also increased alertness. Caffeine 250 mg counteracted diazepam induced (10 mg) impairment of cognitive skills and relaxation of extraocular muscles whereas caffeine 500 mg counteracted the same effects of diazepam 20 mg, respectively. Theophylline antagonized diazepam-induced impairment in digit symbol substitution and tapping speed tests. Subjectively, caffeine and theophylline counteracted diazepam induced drowsiness and mental slowness. The results suggest, therefore, that the ample use of methylxanthines compensates various side-effects of benzodiazepines in man. It may also increase the need of sedation and thus the consumption of benzodiazepines.", 
    "2": "Various indications of benzodiazepines in the treatment of chronic alcoholism are discussed. They are prescribed in the treatment of Delirium Tremens and other acute withdrawal syndromes, often by intramuscular injections or intraveinous infusions. Their efficacy is particularly marked on withdrawal seizures, agitation, more inconstant on confusion, hallucinations and even on tremor symptoms. They more prevent withdrawal symptoms than they reverse severe ethanol withdrawal symptomatology, on humans like on experimental animals. Most authors recommend short prescriptions of BZD in alcoholic patients: the main difficulty is not the problem of the pharmacological interactions between alcohol and BZD, only observed during acute and important ingestions of alcohol and more linked to summation than to potentialisation , but the risk of an abuse and even a psychological and physical dependency to BZD. Such a dependence syndrome would probably develop more frequently in alcoholic patients. One must not overrate its importance; the extended prescription of BZD must not be therefore prohibited when they seem useful in the maintain of alcohol abstinence.", 
    "3": "Diazepam and clonazepam when given by intra- veinous or rectal route are the first-choice treatment of epileptic status. They are active in 80 per cent of cases whatever is the form of the status with a better efficacy in generalized seizures. Clonazepam, chlorazepate, nitrazepam and clobazam are also prescribed as chronic treatment of various forms of epilepsy. However tolerance and side-effects on higher nervous functions are frequent. In the state of the art benzodiazepine utilisation is limited as add-on therapy in severe epilepsies. They may have broader indications in monotherapy.", 
    "4": "The anxiolytic efficacy and safety of lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide were evaluated and compared during a five-day double-blind trial in 50 male inpatients who were experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The total daily doses of lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide were tapered from 6 to 2 mg and from 150 to 50 mg, respectively, during the first four days; no medication was given on day 5. Drug effectiveness was measured by improvements in the total severity assessment score (TSAS), in the three composite TSAS factors, and by the physician's global rating. No drug-related adverse effects occurred during treatment. Vital signs remained stable, and laboratory test results remained within normal limits. The results indicate that lorazepam was as effective as chlordiazepoxide in reducing the symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal. Because of its simpler and more predictable metabolic pathway and its insignificant accumulation in plasma during multiple-dose therapy, lorazepam may be the drug of choice if benzodiazepine therapy is required for chronic alcoholics with acute withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "5": "The diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is a major clinical issue. This is because the complaint of insomnia is highly prevalent and because the various clinical and laboratory manifestations of insomnia are complex. In addition, insomnia involves both day and night. This paper attempts to provide a rational framework for the evaluation of insomnia and the use of sleeping pills. Insomnia is defined and described with special attention to differentiating the subjective complaint and the laboratory assessment of objective sleep parameters. Specific disorders causing or associated with sleep disturbance and the complaint of insomnia are described, and some data bearing on relative prevalence of specific disorders are presented. Consideration of sleeping pills involves the evaluation of hypnotic efficacy as a property of the medication on the one hand and the practical clinical application on the other. Properties of different hypnotics are reviewed, including factors that affect the use of hypnotics in clinical practice. It is concluded that the rational use of sleeping pills demands a systematic approach to the evaluation of the individual patient and a specific attempt to formulate individual treatment goals together with a knowledgeable consideration of the specific chemotherapeutic agent to be utilized.", 
    "6": "This investigation compares the effects of single and double doses of nitrazepam (5 and 10 mg) and zopiclone (7.5 and 15 mg) and placebo for 1 night in 40 psychiatric patients. The results indicate that zopiclone is an active hypnotic compound, comparable in its effects to those of nitrazepam, the higher dosage being best adapted to the type of patients included in the study.", 
    "7": "Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone derivative which exerts, in animal and man, an hypnotic activity comparable to that of flurazepam. In healthy adult insomniacs it was well tolerated upon repeated administration for 28 days. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, three dose levels of zopiclone (5, 7.5, and 10 mg) were compared to 15 mg of flurazepam in 30 geriatric insomniacs. The 7.5- and 10-mg doses demonstrated hypnotic potency comparable to that of flurazepam, and the active treatments were superior to placebo. For most sleep indices, 7.5 mg was the optimal therapeutic dose. Few side effects were reported. These were not clinically significant. Zopiclone is efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of geriatric patients suffering from insomnia. A dosage range of 7.5-10 mg is recommended.", 
    "8": "A double-blind crossover trial was conducted in 42 outpatients of either sex in order to obtain information on the properties of 7.5 mg of zopiclone in a general practice setting compared with 2 mg of flunitrazepam. Each patient went through two periods of treatment, each period lasting 10 days. A comparison of the effect of the drugs showed a significant difference with regard to effectiveness and sleep latency favoring flunitrazepam. When patient's preferences were analyzed there was a highly significant difference favoring flunitrazepam both for effectiveness and tolerance. The side effects from both drugs were generally mild.", 
    "9": "Zopiclone is a new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, the recommended dose of which is 7.5 mg. It was compared to flurazepam 30 mg in a sleep laboratory study. 12 women aged 40-60 years, with subjective sleep disorders for at least 2 months, were treated for 13 nights with each drug in a crossover double-blind design. Each active drug period was preceded by 5 days of placebo washout and followed by 35 days of withdrawal (no treatment). A baseline period of 4 nights (without treatment) was obtained before the study itself. The subjects slept in the sleep laboratory during the baseline period, during the last 3 nights on placebo, during the last 3 nights on active drug, and from the 11th to the 13th night after active drug discontinuation. Polygraphic recordings were obtained during each of these nights. The criteria of Kales and Rechtschaffen were used to score the tracings. Both drugs were shown to be effective when compared to placebo. Comparisons between the two periods with active treatment did not show significant differences for sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency index, stage 0, percent REM, number of REM periods, and REM latency. There was a trend towards an increase with zopiclone of the number of awakenings, percent of stage 3, percent of deep sleep, and an increase with flurazepam of the percent of light sleep. A significant difference was only found for percent of stage 2 (increased with flurazepam).", 
    "10": "Buspirone HCl (Buspar) is a novel anxiolytic agent unrelated to the benzodiazepines or other psychotherapeutic agents. Animal studies support an anxioselective profile, i.e. relief of anxiety without sedation, muscle relaxation or anticonvulsant activity. Double-blind clinical studies show buspirone to be effective in the treatment of anxiety and anxiety in the presence of depression. The effects of buspirone on psychomotor function, physical dependence and abuse potential tests are similar to those seen with placebo treatments. Mechanism of action studies indicate activity in a variety of neuronal systems.", 
    "11": "Efficacy of and tolerance to brotizolam when used as a preoperative hypnotic were studied in two double-blind, randomised parallel group studies. Brotizolam (0.25 and 0.50 mg) was superior to placebo. Efficacy was assessed as good-to-satisfactory in 73.0% of patients with 0.25 mg and in 88.0% with 0.5 mg. A similar assessment was reached in 40.0% of patients with placebo. Brotizolam 0.5 mg was superior to 0.25 mg, and with the higher dose subjective assessments of anxiety were reduced. Efficacy of tolerance to 0.5 mg brotizolam and 2.0 mg flunitrazepam were compared, and both drugs were found to be effective and well tolerated. Brotizolam maintained sleep throughout the night more effectively than flunitrazepam. A dose range of 0.25-0.5 mg brotizolam is recommended as a pre-operative hypnotic.", 
    "12": "Efficacy and tolerability of brotizolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg) were compared over a 6-day period with nitrazepam (5.0 mg) in middle-aged patients (less than 65 years) with sleep disturbances requiring medication. The study was double-blind and randomised with a cross-over design. Each preparation reduced sleep onset latency and frequency of awakenings, and improved quality and duration of sleep as well as subjective condition on awakening. Brotizolam 0.25 mg was found to be equally effective as 0.5 mg, and so the lower dose is recommended for the middle aged.", 
    "13": "Efficacy of and tolerance to 0.25 mg brotizolam and 2.0 mg flunitrazepam were compared over a period of 6 days in ambulatory patients complaining of sleep disturbance. The study was double-blind and randomised with a parallel group design. Both drugs improved sleep. More patients assessed sleep latency as shorter during the first night of ingestion with flunitrazepam than with brotizolam, but assessments were comparable over the next 5 days. The number of patients who considered that the frequency of nocturnal awakenings was less did not differ significantly between drugs. Tolerance to brotizolam (0.25 mg) was assessed more favourably than with flunitrazepam (2.0 mg). The study suggests that brotizolam (0.25 mg) is indicated for patients who have difficulty in falling asleep and staying asleep, and who must preserve their alertness during the early part of the next day. Flunitrazepam (2.0 mg) is equally effective, but at this dose there is a higher incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "14": "Pirenzepine, a new antimuscarinic drug which selectively binds to gastric mucosal muscarinic receptors, has been found to be as effective as cimetidine in promoting the healing of duodenal ulcer. Since recurrence is the major clinical problem in duodenal ulcer, the authors have performed a double-blind randomized study to evaluate the relapse rates during a follow-up period of six months after healing with pirenzepine. Fifty patients were admitted to the trial and randomly allocated to placebo (group C) or pirenzepine (50 mg daily, group A, and 100 mg daily, group B). Forty-four patients completed the trial. During the six months treatment 9 patients had relapses. No significant difference was found between three groups. No side-effects were observed. The 6-month treatment with 50 mg or 100 mg of pirenzepine was well tolerated and without side-effects. The relapse rate during the six months after healing was very low and no significant difference was found between relapse rates in the three treatment groups. These results suggest that seasonal treatment with pirenzepine will prevent duodenal ulcer relapses, increase patient compliance and reduce the social cost of peptic ulcer disease. Additional studies over 12 months of treatment should be undertaken to verify our findings.", 
    "15": "A methodology is described which is practical in assessing the benefit-risk ratio of a single new drug prior to marketing. Flunitrazepam at doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg (and 2 mg) nocte in 2,435 patients is shown to be effective in 78% of patients and the acute risk, predictable and low, irrespective of age or dose. One may conclude that the acute benefit-risk ratio is acceptable with respect to the class of drug and indication for which flunitrazepam is prescribed.", 
    "16": "The hypnotic effects of Zopiclone, a novel cyclopyrrolone derivative, were compared with placebo in a double-blind randomized crossover study in insomniac patients. Subjective morning assessments by the patients showed that Zopiclone 7.5 mg improved the quality of sleep, with a reduction in the sleep onset latency and the number of nocturnal awakenings. Zopiclone was judged by the physicians to be superior to placebo and was preferred by the patients. Subjective residual effects and adverse reactions were minimal.", 
    "17": "In an open, multicentre study, the short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic lormetazepam (Loramet) was administered nightly (1-2 mg p.o.) for a period of 7 nights to 665 out-patients with various types of sleep disturbances. The patients assessed the efficacy and acceptability of lormetazepam with the aid of a simple diary card and a set of visual analogue scales. The results showed that about 75% of the patients reported a significant improvement in their sleep pattern. The time to onset of sleep was decreased, the number of nocturnal wakings was reduced and the patients reported waking in the morning more refreshed and co-ordinated. The effects were significant after the first night and there were further significant improvements by the seventh night on the drug. In patients who had prior experience of other hypnotics, twice as many preferred lormetazepam to temazepam and three times as many preferred lormetazepam to nitrazepam. Nine patients withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy and only fifteen patients dropped out following the occurrence of side-effects, mainly drowsiness and light-headedness. It was concluded that lormetazepam is an effective and highly acceptable hypnotic in patients with sleep disturbances.", 
    "18": "The analysis of the results obtained in different tests--sleep studies, cortical and hippocampal EEG activity, PGO-R spikes--in rats or in cats allows the characterization of different classes of drugs and to establish the relative efficacy of psychoactive drugs in these models. Moreover, the sequential spectral analysis of cortical EEG recordings in curarized rats allows the assessment of EEG modifications, of the presence of hypersynchronized rhythms, of the induction and duration of drug action, of topographic drug effects and interactions between different agents. Thus, the use of EEG techniques in various animal species allows a better classification and definition of the central action of drugs.", 
    "19": "The hypnotic effects of l-tryptophan (1 g), secobarbital (100 mg), and flurazepam (30 mg), relative to placebo, were evaluated in a sample of 54 outpatient chronic insomniacs with a major complaint of sleep maintenance insomnia. Three mutually exclusive complaints about sleep maintenance were identified. Analysis of the data from the tryptophan condition indicated that the single factor type of sleep maintenance complaint accounted for 100% of the variance in a measure reflecting a single overall assessment of tryptophan's hypnotic effect, and 52% of variance in a second, repeated measure assessing subjects' day-to-day experience with the treatment. It is concluded that the distinctions in sleep maintenance insomnia identified are likely to be clinically meaningful. The distinct profiles of the tryptophan responders and nonresponders are described, and the utility of the distinctions in understanding the differential effects of flurazepam and secobarbital discussed. The implications of the finding for a number of sleep disorder-related issues were addressed.", 
    "20": "A single-blind, parallel group, multi-centre study was carried out in 2009 patients with an anxiety state to compare the efficacy, tolerance and withdrawal effects of prazepam and diazepam in therapeutically equivalent doses. Patients were allocated at random to receive 30 mg prazepam or 15 mg diazepam per day, either in divided dosage (3 times) during the day or as a single large dose at night. After a 2-week treatment period, drug therapy was withdrawn gradually. Patients were followed-up at weekly intervals over the 4-week study period. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores and physicians' global assessment of response at each visit indicated that whilst both drugs and dosage regimens were effective patients treated with diazepam responded rather less well and had a greater return of anxiety symptoms after therapy was stopped compared to those on prazepam. Moreover, the prazepam-treated patients, especially those on the divided daytime dosage regimen, had fewer and milder side-effects in the early treatment period. Dizziness was least apparent in the prazepam single night time dosage group and it is suggested that this may be an important practical consideration in the treatment of anxiety in the elderly.", 
    "21": "77 primary depressive in-patients aged 18-70 years (mean = 46/47 years) were assigned randomly to experimental and control groups and treated in double-blind conditions in ten centers. Butriptyline and amitriptyline were both administered with an identical increasing schedule, up to 150 mg daily in the first week and a flexible schedule for the last 3 weeks of trial. Mean daily doses were 145 mg butriptyline and 142 mg amitriptyline after 2 weeks, and 77.5 mg amitriptyline and butriptyline after 4 weeks. Nitrazepam (5-10 mg) and haldol (5 mg) were also allowed, only if necessary. Symptomatology and antidepressant efficacy were assessed using the rating scales of Hamilton, Overall, BPRS, CGI and a side effect checklist. After initial comparison of the two treatment groups, the results showed that the antidepressant effects were significantly better with butriptyline on the number of dropouts, on the total score and on the following factors of the Overall Depression Scale: depression, guilt, anxiety, somatization and somatic complaints. Frequency of haldol prescription was significantly lower with butriptyline than with amitriptyline. The overall frequency of side effects and of autonomic symptoms did not differ in the two groups. The effects on other parameters (hematological and biochemical variables, ECG and EEG) were similar for both drugs. In conclusion, butriptyline has the same indications as amitriptyline but shows a better antidepressant efficacy at the same dosage.", 
    "22": "In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 24 anxiety neurotic patients were randomly assigned equally into the intramuscular placebo, lorazepam or diazepam groups. The results indicated that lorazepam was as effective as diazepam in overall efficacy and was superior to diazepam in certain cluster scores including the Obsessive Compulsive Phobic Cluser of the Wittenborn Psychiatric Rating Scale.", 
    "23": "In a double-blind study the clinical symptomatology and quantitatively analyzed EEG of 42 hospitalized chronic alcoholics (ICD 303) undergoing alcohol withdrawal were investigated before, during and after 3 weeks' treatment with 2 pharmacokinetically different benzodiazepines: the short-acting lopirazepam (a new pyridodiazepine) and the long-acting prazepam. At the end of weeks 1 and 3 the titrated optimal daily doses were 24 and 23 mg lopirazepam and 35 and 32 prazepam, respectively, thus confirming our earlier pharmaco-EEG predictions that on a mg to mg basis the former drug is slightly more CNS potent than the latter. Thereafter, the patient population was divided into 6 subgroups: 2 groups continuing on active medication, 2 groups receiving placebo, and 2 groups with no pharmacotherapy for 1 week. Clinical assessments included the CGI, the Hamilton Anxiety Score, the Zung Self-Rating Scale for Anxiety and Depression, the Zerssen Befindlichkeitsskala and the questionnaire for somatic findings and side effect and were carried out on days 0, 7, 21 and 28 as was a radioreceptor assay for benzodiazepines in plasma. Quantitative EEG investigations were carried out on days 0, 21 and 28 and included recordings before and 2 h after one single dose of 10 mg. Statistical analysis demonstrated a marked and highly significant decrease in psychopathology as well as good drug tolerance at the end of the first week of therapy and thereafter a slight continuation in improvement until the end of the 3rd week. There were, however, no statistically significant differences between the 2 active compounds, nor were there any statistically significant differences between the 6 subgroups in the 4th week. On the other hand, blood level investigations demonstrated that even after a 3-week treatment period, blood levels dropped down to a morning minimum 12 h after the last evening medication of the short-acting lopirazepam, while plasma levels of the long-acting prazepam remained high. This was also reflected in the spectral analyzed EEG, which showed, after one single dosage of both drugs, a typical anxiolytic profile which was more pronounced after lopirazepam than prazepam, while after the chronic administration (12 h after the evening medication) only prazepam showed an anxiolytic profile. The lopirazepam-treated patients exhibited on the one hand a lack of benzodiazepine-specific alterations, but showed on the other hand EEG changes possibly reflecting clinical improvement. The relevance of the findings will be discussed.", 
    "24": "The hypnotic efficacy and safety of quazepam 15 mg was compared with placebo in thirty-six out-patients with insomnia. The study was double-blind, with two comparable groups of patients established by random allocation. Following a placebo baseline period, patients took placebo or quazepam for 5 consecutive nights and completed sleep questionnaires the next day. Quazepam was rated better than placebo in terms of sleep quality, sleep induction time, total sleep time, and early morning awakenings. Quazepam treatment was rated as good or excellent by the physician and the patients who received it almost three times more often was placebo. Quazepam was proved to be safe, with no reports of unexpected or serious adverse experiences.", 
    "25": "The short-term safety and hypnotic efficacy of 15 mg of quazepam was compared with that of placebo in a double-blind study in sixty out-patients with insomnia. All patients received placebo for 3 consecutive night to establish a baseline; for the next 5 nights thirty patients received quazepam and thirty received placebo. The results indicated that quazepam was significantly more effective than placebo in terms of quantity and quality of sleep and that quazepam was effective on the first night. Despite having a marked hypnotic effect, quazepam was not different from placebo in terms of hand-over effects (i.e., ease in awakening and alertness) the following morning. Treatment-related adverse experiences were reported by ten patients who received quazepam and by five who received only placebo. The most frequently reported adverse experience was daytime somnolence. This study demonstrates that quazepam, in a 15 mg dose, is an effective, rapidly acting, oral hypnotic agent with a low incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "26": "N,N-Diethyl-N-methyl-[2-[[4-(4-phenylthio) phenyl]-3H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-yl]thio]-ethanaminium iodide) (tibezonium iodide; CAS-54663-47-7), a new oropharyngeal disinfectant, was tested, using the Ames procedure with and without metabolic activation, on five strains of Salmonella typhimurium and using the host mediated assay with Schizosaccharomyces pombe as microorganism test. In both tests the drug did not show any mutagenic activity when compared with mutagenic standards.", 
    "27": "Eighty-one therapeutic trials of alcohol withdrawal were found that have been published in English since 1954; controls were randomized in 29 (RCTs). Two thousand three hundred thirteen patients were randomized. Variable pretreatment description prevented estimates of delirium tremens and convulsion prevalence, but only four deaths were reported. Endpoints were thus entirely subjective in these moderately ill patients. Protocol quality of the RCTs was graded by a previously developed system for evaluating adequacy of descriptions, blinding, and essential measurements. Mean score obtained was .49 +/- .03 (1 SE). (A perfect paper would score 1.00.) Data presentations and statistical analyses scored .18 +/- .03. There was little evidence of improvement of scores over time. Papers lacked confidence intervals, proper handling of dropouts, and adequate details of side effects. In five RCTs, six comparisons showed that benzodiazepines are clearly superior to placebo (p less than .001), but conclusions about comparisons with other drugs were not possible. In none of eight \"negative\" comparisons was the probability of a type II error (beta) considered. Discovery of more effective symptomatic agents or methods of reducing the death rate will require more rigid protocols and analyses as well as larger studies to allow the use of more critical endpoints such as occurrence of delirium tremens, convulsions, or death.", 
    "28": "The induction of antibody formation mediated significant changes in circulating corticosterone (CS) levels in mice. On the day of the peak plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or to the trinitrophenyl (TNP) hapten, the 0800 h serum CS concentration was increased. This hormonal elevation was not observed in SRBC-immunized low responder animals which did not give a significant PFC response, thus suggesting a direct correlation between immune responsiveness and hormonal changes. A change in the circadian rhythm of CS was evident in immune animals injected with SRBC. Control animals injected with saline showed a regular circadian pattern of low CS level at 0800 h followed by a high level at 1600 h. In contrast, responding animals injected with SRBC were found to have a reversed CS pattern, i.e. the hormonal concentration was high at 0800 h and low at 1600 h, on the day of the peak PFC response. This reversal of the circadian CS pattern may have important immunoregulatory significance. The immunization-induced CS response could be significantly blocked by the administration of diazepam (DZM), an effect which implies the involvement of central hypothalamic-pituitary control of the response.", 
    "29": "A double-blind crossover study was carried out in 16 patients with insomnia to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of a new hypnotic, loprazolam, with that of nitrazepam and placebo. Patients received 1 capsule each night for 7 days of either 1 mg loprazolam, 5 mg nitrazepam or placebo and then 7 days' treatment with each of the other medications in random order. The results of analogue rating scale assessment by the patients showed that 'ease of getting to sleep' and 'quality of sleep' were significantly better with loprazolam than with placebo. Loprazolam appeared to be at least as effective, if not more so, than nitrazepam. There were no significant differences between treatments on the morning muzziness assessment, which was low in each group, or in the psychometric tests carried out indicating that loprazolam is unlikely to produce hangover effects. There were no obvious differences between treatments in the incidence or frequency of side-effects spontaneously volunteered by the patients.", 
    "30": "Reproduction can be impaired in animals and man by drugs and various environmental agents. Depending on the time of exposure--from fertilization through the fetal period and eventually during lactation--the consequences can range from embryotoxicity, gross malformations and a large variety of more subtle morphological, biochemical, and functional abnormalities. The high susceptibility of the embryo to exogenous agents is due to cellular multiplication and differentiation and to the lack of development of the enzyme systems necessary for the detoxification of chemicals. At present, developmental impairments represent the main cause of perinatal mortality and postnatal morbidity. After a review of prenatal physiology and teratogenic principles, the action of selected drugs and environmental agents is analyzed. The potential danger of environmental factors during intrauterine development is of particular concern because of its irreversible nature.", 
    "31": "The pharmacodynamics of a drug is defined as the effect of the drug on physiological functions and pathological processes and can be modified in the elderly by (a) pharmacokinetics, (b) receptor sensitivity (or density), (c) impaired homeostasis or (d) pathology. The alterations in pharmacokinetics in the elderly often result in a reduction of the dose required to achieve the optimum pharmacodynamic effect. Changes in the sensitivity of receptors may be decreased in the elderly (perhaps by a diminution in the number of receptors) as in the case of the beta-adrenergic blockers, but increase in sensitivity may also be found as in the case of warfarin. Impairment of homeostatic mechanisms, while related to aging, are frequently produced by pathological processes and have an important influence on the pharmacodynamics of many drugs. The effect of the multiple pathology often found in the elderly is likely to be the dominant factor in changes in pharmacodynamics in this population. The interaction of the above factors results in a heterogeneity of pharmacodynamic response in the elderly which requires the careful monitoring of both the efficacy and toxicity of their drug treatment.", 
    "32": "The present review deals with animal data substantiating the functional significance of central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors both in the pharmacological effects of BZD and, in a more general way, in the control of anxiety-related states or behavior. Several experiments including those dealing with BZD antagonists (Ro 15-1788, beta-carbolines) reveal that an excellent correlation exists between BZD receptors occupancy and the intensity of various pharmacological actions of BZD or of agents known to bind to these receptors. Furthermore, BZD binding can be modified by subjecting laboratory animals to chronic BZD administration, convulsant treatments or anxiogenic situations. Finally, the reciprocal influence that appears between BZD receptors and GABA receptors can be relevantly associated with many pharmacological action of BZD. Such a notion further reinforce the functional role(s) that BZD receptors may have within the brain. Taken together these data suggest that the plasticity of BZD receptors is in fact similar to that observed for other receptors, the corresponding endogenous neurotransmitter of which is already identified.", 
    "33": "The results obtained by positron-emission tomography in an \"in vivo\" study on the baboon using a benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam) labeled with carbon-11 are presented. The specificity of \"in vivo\" binding of Flunitrazepam-11C was demonstrated by competition with Lorazepam in the brain, but it was not possible to verify the criterium of stereospecificity \"in vivo\". The preliminary results of a study carried out under the same conditions on RO 15 1788 11C show the interest of using this labeled antagonist as an \"in vivo\" ligand for the specific binding sites of benzodiazepines in positron-emission tomography.", 
    "34": "Zopiclone (ZPC; RP 27,267), which is chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines (BZD), was found to have a similar pharmacological profile and to possess in man hypnotic activity similar to that of some BZD such as nitrazepam. It was, therefore, interesting to study the interaction of ZPC with rat brain receptors and specially with the so-called 'BZD receptors'. ZPC possesses in three rat brain regions a high affinity for BZD receptors: its Ki values measured against [3H]-flunitrazepam are 24 nM in the cerebral cortex, 31 nM in the cerebellum, and 36 nM in the hippocampus. No other brain receptors such as gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, dopamine receptor, serotonin and noradrenergic receptors are reached by ZPC. Moreover, ZPC seems to bind only to brain BZD receptors and, contrarily to some BZD such as flunitrazepam, it does not reach the peripheral renal BZD-binding sites. The synthesis of [3H]-ZPC has permitted a more in-depth study of the interaction of ZPC with brain receptors. The high affinity of ZPC has been confirmed by equilibrium-binding studies (KD = 13 +/- 4 nM in rat hippocampus) and the study of the modulating effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid and barbiturates on ZPC binding has revealed some differences between ZPC and BZD. It could, therefore, be postulated that ZPC might bind in rat brain to sites which do not correspond exactly to BZD sites.", 
    "35": "A series of (+) and (-) tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide stereoisomers related to the ethyl ester of beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) have been tested for their ability to displace 3H-flunitrazepam from binding sites prepared from rat cerebral cortex (benzodiazepine receptors). The (+) stereoisomers of ethyl and propyl 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxamides were the most potent inhibitors of specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding and had significantly lower IC50s than the corresponding (-) isomers. Although the IC50 values for this series of tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxamides were about 1000 fold higher than the IC50 value for beta-CCE, these compounds were as potent as the beta-carboline alkaloids harmane and harmine. The title compounds may be useful stereoisomeric probes for the characterization of subtypes of specific benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "36": "An imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro15-1788, has anticonvulsant effects in the kindling model for epilepsy. Ro15-1788 reverses the sedative actions of diazepam (3 mg/kg i.p.) but does not reverse the anticonvulsant effects. The anticonvulsant effects of Ro15-1788 are prevented by the pyrazoloquinolinone CGS-8216 which interacts with benzodiazepine receptors but has no anticonvulsant actions itself. It is suggested that Ro15-1788 is a partial agonist at the BZ2 (anticonvulsant) receptor but is an antagonist at the BZ1 (sedative, anxiolytic) receptor. CGS-8216 is an antagonist at both receptors. Ro15-1788 or related compounds may be effective anticonvulsants without the sedative side-effects usually found with the benzodiazepines.", 
    "37": "The opioid benzodiazepine tifluadom and its (+) and (-) enantiomers affect locomotor activity of mice with patterns different from those of diazepam or the prototype opioids morphine (mu) or bremazocine (kappa). Lacking the initial locomotor inhibition, the sum of activity of the two enantiomers does not comply with the effects of the racemic mixture, thus indicating a non-additive interaction. In addition to the opioid effects of tifluadom, the effective antagonisms to the locomotor stimulatory phase of this compound and its enantiomers by Ro 15-1788 points to some interaction with the benzodiazepine/GABA-receptor complex.", 
    "38": "Responses of medullary dorsal horn neurones to both mechanical and thermal noxious stimuli were recorded in urethane anaesthetized rats. Opiates with reported activity at K receptors (tifluadom, BL 5572M, and U50488) were found to reduce responses to both noxious stimuli, and in this respect, were indistinguishable from the mu agonist fentanyl. These observations are in contrast to the behavioural antinociceptive effects of K agonists as these substances are active in tests using mechanical noxious stimuli but in those using thermal stimuli have little effect. It is therefore possible that the modality decoding seen in behavioural experiments occurs at a supraspinal level.", 
    "39": "Suppression of evoked potentials of the EEG are indicators of analgesia. Tifluadom induces latency changes which are reversed by the kappa-antagonist Mr 2266. Naloxone reverses peak suppression which indicates an additional interaction with the my-opioid-receptor. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 is not effective in reversing peak-changes. Therefore nociceptive stimuli are modulated by tifluadom not only through the interaction with kappa- but also with my-opioid-receptors.", 
    "40": "The dose response curves of picrotoxin-induced seizures and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures were shifted to the right by the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist lorazepam, and to the left by the inverse agonists, DMCM, ZK 90886, FG 7142 and CGS 8216. The BZ receptor antagonists ZK 93426 and Ro 15-1788 had no effect on the dose response curves. The anticonvulsive action of lorazepam and the proconvulsive action of DMCM against picrotoxin-induced seizures and against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures was inhibited by low doses of ZK 93426 and Ro 15-1788. These results indicate that the bidirectional effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands on picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol induced seizures is actually mediated through benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "41": "The pharmacokinetics of loprazolam have been studied in eight healthy male volunteers after single and repeated 2 mg oral doses taken at night, for eight nights. The absorption and disposition of unchanged drug (HPLC-GC assay) and receptor active benzodiazepine-type materials (radioreceptor assay) were examined after the first and eighth dose. Maximum levels of approximately 10 ng ml-1 (range 3.6 to 15.5 ng ml-1) were reached within about 2.5 h after dosing. The post-peak levels declined in a single exponential fashion with an overall mean +/- SD half-life of 7.06 +/- 1.98 h and total areas under the curve ranging from 35.9 to 189.0 ng ml-1 h. There were no statistical differences between the values for the first and eighth doses. There was no evidence to suggest that significant accumulation of parent drug or receptor active benzodiazepine-type materials had occurred, and it is concluded that the kinetics of loprazolam would allow repeated daily doses of 2 mg.", 
    "42": "DMCM is a convulsant agent with negative efficacy at benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. 3H-DMCM binds to benzodiazepine receptors in vitro. The sensitivity of 3H-DMCM binding to agents presumed to act on chloride channels associated with the BZ/GABA-receptor-complex was investigated at 37 degrees C. Chloride ions (200 mM) enhanced the specific binding of 3H-DMCM four-fold. Similarly the specific binding of 3H-DMCM was enhanced by picrotoxinine in the absence but not in the presence of chloride ions. (+)-Etomidate and pentobarbital reduced the specific 3H-DMCM binding in a partially chloride ion dependent and picrotoxinine sensitive manner. The results obtained are consonant with the idea that 3H-DMCM binds to the BZ/GABA-receptor-chloride ionophor complex; furthermore, binding of 3H-DMCM seems to involve a chloride dependent allosteric regulation mechanism.", 
    "43": "The concept that GABA is a neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS is supported by both electrophysiological and biochemical data. Whereas the electrophysiological studies are essential for demonstrating a specific functional response to GABA, the biochemical approach is useful for characterizing the molecular properties of this site. As a result of these studies the concept of the GABA receptor has progressed from a simple model of a single recognition site associated with a chloride channel to a more complex structure having a variety of interacting components. Thus, both electrophysiological and biochemical data support the existence of at least two pharmacologically distinct types of GABA receptors, based on the sensitivity to bicuculline. Also, anatomically, there appear to be two different types of receptors, those located postsynaptically on the soma or dendrites of a neighboring cell and those found presynaptically on GABAergic and other neurotransmitter terminals. From biochemical studies it appears that the GABA receptor may be composed of at least three distinct interacting components. One of these, the recognition site, may exist in two conformations, with one preferring agonists and the other having a higher affinity for antagonists. Ion channels may be considered a second component, with some of these regulating the passage of chloride ion, whereas others may be associated with calcium transport. The third major element of GABA receptors appears to be a benzodiazepine recognition site, although only a certain population of GABA receptors may be endowed with this property. In addition to these, the GABA receptor complex appears to contain substances that modulate the recognition site by influencing the availability of higher affinity binding proteins. It would appear therefore that changes affecting any one of these constituents can influence the characteristics of the others. While increasing the complexity of the system, this arrangement makes for a more sensitive and adaptable receptor mechanism. Thus the GABA receptor can be envisioned as a supramolecular complex of interacting sites, all of which contribute to the functional expression of receptor activation. Because of this complexity, GABA receptors can theoretically be modified in a variety of ways by drug treatment or disease. Accordingly, it may be possible to develop selective agonists and antagonists that may act at one of the basic components, as well as agents that may alter the receptor modulators. Conversely, a disorder of any of these entities may result in an alteration of GABA receptor function, which in turn could contribute to the symptoms of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The efficiency of separation of the radioligand receptor complex from the unbound ligand by both rapid filtration and centrifugation is compared for two standard receptor assays in the rat brain: the beta-adrenergic receptor using 3H-dihydroalprenolol and the benzodiazepine receptor using 3H-flunitrazepam. Whereas in beta-adrenergic binding studies both separation procedures yield similar binding data, the apparent binding in the benzodiazepine receptor assay is lower in the filtration experiments as compared to the data obtained by centrifugation, indicating an incomplete retention of the ligand receptor complex by filter. However, in both assays the results of the binding studies are highly dependent on the type of filters used. The following filters were compared: glass fibre filters GE/B and GF/C (Whatman Ltd., Kent, England), membrane filter HAWP (pore size 0.45 micrometer, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, U.S.A.) and glass fibre filters NK I, NK VIII, NK-15-90, NK 13-90, NK 14-120 (all produced by VEB Feinpapierfabrik Neu-Kaliss, G.D.R.). Although a somewhat higher specific binding can be obtained by the membrane filter and several types of the NK filters as compared to the most widely used Whatman GF/C the manifold higher unspecific binding of the radioligand by these filters does not favour their use in ligand assays. Retention as well as unspecific binding of the filter NK VIII is very similar to the Whatman GF/C filter. This new filter seems, therefore, well suited for radioligand studies.", 
    "45": "The long term behavioural and biochemical effects of chronic chlordiazepoxide treatment during the period of neuronal maturation in the rat have been investigated. The administration to lactating mothers of chlordiazepoxide at very low doses (0.22 and 2.6 mg/kg) in their drinking water affects both behavioural and biochemical parameters in offspring at 60 days of age and undrugged since weaning. A deficit in the acquisition of the conditioned avoidance response in treated rats was observed, although no significant difference in spontaneous locomotor activity between control and treated rats was found. 3H-Flunitrazepam binding sites in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were decreased by the treatment, whereas no change was detected in cerebellum. Moreover, 3H-muscimol binding sites increased in hippocampus with no changes in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. According to the different regional distribution of benzodiazepine type 1 and type 2 receptors, we suggest that type 2 receptors are selectively affected by the treatment, and that the GABAergic receptor system is also permanently altered by administration of chlordiazepoxide during early postnatal life.", 
    "46": "Development of the acute depressant effect of oxazepam (in a dose of 10 mg/kg egg weight) on spontaneous and activated motor activity was studied in chick embryos (incubation age 11-19 days). The depressant effect of oxazepam was demonstrated for the first time in 13-day-old embryos. From the 15th day of incubation it led to prolonged depression of embryonic motility. From the 15th day the depressant effect of oxazepam depended on the connections of the central motor output with the prosencephalon. In mesencephalic, rhombencephalic and spinal preparations the effect of oxazepam was insignificant. In 13- and 15-day-old embryos oxazepam blocked the activating effect of strychnine and pentylenetetrazol, but not the picrotoxin-induced activation. The picrotoxin activation of embryonic motility was incompletely blocked for the first time in 17-day-old and completely only in 19-day-old embryos. The results are discussed with reference to heterochronia of development of the various components in the complex GABA receptor.", 
    "47": "The receptor binding affinity data of a series of 39 benzodiazepines (BDZ) have been analyzed by means of the Free-Wilson model The comparison of th individual group contributions shows the primary importance of the presence of a carbonyl group at position 2 and of a nitrogen atom at position 4 of the diazepine ring for an optimum receptor binding. The great difference between group contributions of BDZ having different absolute configurations with respect to the chiral carbon atom at position 3 of the diazepine ring is discussed in terms of BDZ-receptor interactions.", 
    "48": "The effects of intravenously administered diazepam (0.6 mg/kg) on vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), optovestibular reflex (OVR) and their after-nystagmus were examined in rabbits. These reflexes were evoked by velocity step of 20 degrees/sec of chair or drum rotation. Slow phase eye velocity (SPEV) of OVR shows algebraic summation of those of VOR and OKN. Although SPEVs of VOR, OKN and OVR significantly decreased at 10 and 30 min after diazepam injection (p less than 0.05, t-test), OKN shows most distinctive reduction. SPEV reduction of OVR after diazepam administration was also equal to the algebraic summation of VOR and OKN reductions.", 
    "49": "Several lectins (concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, wax bean agglutinin, and phytohemagglutinin) induce aggregation and precipitation of deoxycholate-solubilized benzodiazepine receptors from calf cerebral cortex. These receptors were also retained on columns of immobilized lectins. Photoaffinity labeling of the soluble benzodiazephine receptors prevented their interaction with lectins. Periodate treatment caused inactivation of benzodiazepine receptors which was partially prevented by diazepam and/or gamma-aminobutyric acid. The possible association of the drug-binding site and the carbohydrate moiety is discussed.", 
    "50": "The existence of benzodiazepine receptors in the human fetal brain, liver and placenta has been studied. At 12-15 weeks of gestation specific binding to fetal brain occurs. The dissociation constant of [3H]-flunitrazepam-specific binding was 1.5-2 nM and the maximum number of binding sites was 2.3-3.8 fmol/mg of total brain tissue. In the fetal liver and placenta some specific binding exists, yet the nonspecific binding is more extensive.", 
    "51": "RO5-4864, a ligand for both the peripheral and for the central nervous system micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites, was investigated in the holeboard, alone and in combination with several other drugs. RO5-4864 alone caused a marked reduction in rears and motor activity and reduced head-dipping when objects were placed under the holes. All these reductions were enhanced by picrotoxin (2 and 4 mg/kg) and by CGS 8216 (3 mg/kg). RO15-1788 (10 mg/kg) reversed the reduction in rears and PK11195 (30 mg/kg), a putative antagonist for the peripheral binding site, reversed the reduction in head-dipping. The results are discussed in terms of the various benzodiazepine binding sites and possible non-specific drug effects.", 
    "52": "Kynurenine, an endogenous cerebral and peripheral neuroactive metabolite of 1-tryptophan, exerts stimulant and convulsant effects in mice, rats and frogs. In mice it (intracerebroventricularly, ICV) antagonized the anticaffeine effect of diazepam and in smaller doses potentiated its sedative action. In rats 1-kynurenine (ICV) potentiated the convulsant action of caffeine. The effect of pentylenetetrazol was not altered in either species. The convulsant effect of 1-kynurenine is the most resistant among various convulsants towards the protective action of diazepam. The structure of 1-kynurenine is similar to benzophenones, metabolites of diazepam, and has four structural fragments common with diazepam. Putative endogenous and non-endogenous ligands of the benzodiazepine receptors have from one to three of these common fragments. Among the antagonists of diazepam exhibiting stimulant and convulsant action ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate has the same four fragments, Ro 5-3663 and Ro 15-1788 have three and caffeine two. The most striking dissimilarity is a diazo-moiety (N-C-C-N or N-C=C-C=N) absent in the structure of 1-kynurenine. This moiety seems to be the most important for the binding to the benzodiazepine receptors. A role of each fragment and their combinations as well as the stereoconfiguration for the pharmacological activity is considered. It is suggested that 1-kynurenine is a putative endogenous modulator or, less probably, ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor of either type (most probably that which mediates anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines) or a part of this receptor. The benzodiazepine receptor might be a phylogenetically transformed kynurenine receptor. Highly selective antagonism of purines to 1-kynurenine suggests that it can modulate the function of the benzodiazepine receptors via purinergic mechanisms. Stimulant and convulsant action of 1-kynurenine can be related to a moiety of succinic acid (O=C-C-C-C=O) which is typical of quinolinic acid, the strongest endogenous convulsant among kynurenines, and aspartic acid, an excitatory amino acid. 1-Kynurenine is suggested to be an anxiogenic and convulsigenic endogenous factor.", 
    "53": "The modification of membrane proteins with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) and diazotized sulfanilate was investigated on the binding of three benzodiazepine radioligands in three brain regions. Both of these reagents produced a dose-dependent inactivation of [3H] diazepam, [3H]flunitrazepam, and [3H]propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding to cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. Both DEP and diazotized sulfanilate decrease the Bmax of the benzodiazepine binding sites without altering the KD. The ability of muscimol and pentobarbital to enhance [3H]diazepam binding was not altered by DEP pretreatment in any of the three regions. Scatchard analysis indicated that, following the inactivation of 40-50% of [3H]diazepam binding by 1 mM DEP, pentobarbital and muscimol were still able to increase the affinity of [3H]diazepam binding in cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. In contrast, diazotized sulfanilate pretreatment abolishes the ability of muscimol and pentobarbital to enhance [3H]diazepam binding in these three regions. The effects of these reagents on [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding revealed that sulfanilate but not DEP eliminates the low-affinity GABA receptor sites in cortex and cerebellum. Thus, while both DEP and sulfanilate inactivate benzodiazepine binding sites, only sulfanilate abolishes the low-affinity GABA binding sites and the ability of the GABA agonists to enhance [3H]diazepam binding. These results suggest that the stimulation of benzodiazepine binding appears to be mediated by the low-affinity GABA receptors.", 
    "54": "A single injection of diazepam (10 mg/kg, s.c.), haloperidol (2 mg/kg, i.p.) or chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the ambulatory as well as sniffing behaviour of rats. These behavioural responses were further decreased when diazepam was administered concurrently with the neuroleptic. Acute haloperidol or chlorpromazine treatment increased striatal dopamine as well as cerebro-cortical norepinephrine turnover. In contrast, diazepam diminished the release of both of these catecholamines. When diazepam was administered together with haloperidol or chlorpromazine, a further decrease particularly in dopamine release was seen in striatum. This effect of diazepam on norepinephrine and dopamine turnover persisted even after 21 days of daily treatment, Similarly, the sedative effect of diazepam elicited in the form of depressed locomotor activity was also apparent after long-term administration of this benzodiazepine. However, chronic administration of neuroleptics enhanced the spontaneous locomotor activity and sniffing behaviour by about 25%. Furthermore, repeated neuroleptic treatment decreased the synthesis and turnover of dopamine and norepinephrine. This was reflected in decreased tyrosine hydroxylase and homovanillic acid level in striatum as well as by low concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol in the cerebral cortex. When diazepam was administered together with haloperidol or chlorpromazine for 21 days, behavioural activity remained elevated and was comparable to groups of rats receiving neuroleptics alone. The cocomitant injection of diazepam and neuroleptics for 21 days elicited a synergistic effect on decreased synthesis and release of dopamine as well as norepinephrine. These data provide neurochemical evidence for potentiation of the neuroleptic effects by a benzodiazepine.", 
    "55": "In order to identify the relative number of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in Purkinje and granule cells, the Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mutant mouse was used at different ages. In these mice, Purkinje cells have degenerated almost completely by 45-50 days of age. Granule cell loss occurs only later, and is most severe between 180 and 300 days. [3H]Flunitrazepam (FNZ) and [3H]ethyl-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CC) were used as ligands. In the 45-50-day-old pcd mice, it was found that there is approximately a 50% decrease in the number of receptors as labeled by [3H]beta-CC or [3H]FNZ, when the binding is expressed as fmol/cerebellum. The binding decreased by approximately 80% in 300-day-old pcd mice (fmol/cerebellum). [3H]FNZ was not displaced by 1 microM RO5-4864, ruling out binding to glial cells. Nonlinear regression analysis of FNZ saturation data provided evidence for two populations of receptors (high and low affinity sites). Only the low-affinity sites were reduced in number at 45 days. [3H]beta-CC saturation data showed, however, only one population of receptors. The total number of receptors (Bmax) was significantly lower for beta-CC than for FNZ in the control mice. It appears that 50% of the total BZ receptors is associated with Purkinje cells. In addition, our data on 300-day-old pcd mutants strongly suggest the existence of granule cell-associated BZ receptors.", 
    "56": "It has been confirmed that 24 hours following a series of electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) given once daily for 10 days (ECS X 10) to rats there is an increase in GABA concentration in the corpus striatum. A similar change was seen after the ECS had been given to rats anaesthetised with halothane, or when 5 ECS were given spread out over 10 days, the rats being anaesthetised during the ECS. A daily convulsion for 10 days elicited by flurothyl exposure resulted in an increased striatal GABA concentration, but also increased the GABA concentration in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex. The increase in striatal GABA concentration was present 24 hours after ECS daily for 5 days or 3 days after ECS daily for 10 days. No change in [3H]-diazepam binding was seen in hippocampus, cortex or corpus striatum 24 hours after the last of 10 once daily ECS. The increase in striatal GABA concentration was therefore seen at all times when enhanced monoamine-mediated behaviours have been demonstrated following seizures.", 
    "57": "Rat brain GABA levels were elevated chronically by daily administration of gamma-vinyl GABA, an enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor of GABA:2-oxo-glutarate aminotransferase (GABA-T; EC2.6.1.19). Following various periods of drug treatment and withdrawal, the sensitivity of dopamine and GABA receptors in the CNS was determined by biochemical and behavioral evaluations. In contrast to chronic haloperidol treatment, none of the treatment schedules with gamma-vinyl GABA had any significant effect on parameters such as apomorphine induced locomotor activity, [3H] spiperone binding or dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the corpus striatum; nor did gamma-vinyl GABA treatment affect [3H] GABA binding or GABA-activated [3H] diazepam binding in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, co-administration of gamma-vinyl GABA and haloperidol did not alter the ability of the neuroleptic to induce supersensitivity in the striatal dopaminergic system. Thus, it appears that, in contrast to reported studies using chronic administration of other less specific GABA-T inhibitors such as gamma-acetylenic GABA, amino-oxyacetic acid and isonicotinic acid hydrazide or direct GABA agonists such as THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (5,4-c-)-pyridin-3-ol) or kojic amine, gamma-vinyl GABA does not alter the sensitivity of the striatal dopaminergic system.", 
    "58": "Two types of benzodiazepine receptors were demonstrated in spinal cord. Binding to one of these sites (neuronal) was sensitive to the centrally active benzodiazepine, clonazepam, and binding was enhanced both by chloride and GABA. The second site was sensitive to 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-(p-chlorophenyl) 2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one (R05-4864) and thus is similar to the site characteristic of non-neuronal tissue. Binding to the neuronal site was inhibited by the putative glycine antagonist, strychnine, both in spinal cord and brain. This inhibition may account for the reported anti-GABAergic properties of strychnine and does not appear to be related to the glycine receptor.", 
    "59": "1. When tested at concentrations resulting in significant inhibitions of adenosine uptake in brain slices, diazepam and several other benzodiazepines were without effect on brain adenosine kinase. 2. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of the benzodiazepines on adenosine accumulation is at the membrane transport level and not by an inhibition of the intracellular phosphorylation step which facilitates adenosine uptake.", 
    "60": "Since inosine is an inhibitory ligand for benzodiazepine binding, and since several of the purine enzymes have a specific localization, it was hypothesized that the unique distribution of benzodiazepine receptors may be dependent on the regional concentrations and specific actions of these enzymes in increasing or decreasing the amount of inosine. To test the above theory, the binding of 3H-flunitrazepam to receptors was studied on homogenates of various regions of autopsied human brain before and after treatment with irreversible potent inhibitors of the purine enzymes guanine deaminase and adenosine deaminase. As predicted, inhibition of guanase, which metabolizes guanine and hypoxanthine to xanthine, caused a marked inhibition of binding in the cerebral cortex and midbrain, where there is an abundance of enzyme, and only slight change in binding in the medulla, cerebellum or pons, where there is little enzyme. When adenosine deaminase, which converts adenosine to inosine, was inhibited, there was increased binding, with as much as a 4-fold increase in the frontal lobe, and very little effect in the cerebellum, medulla or temporal lobe.", 
    "61": "Patients with ulcers of the stomach and the duodenum were treated with Pirenzepin and the new H2-inhibitor Renitidin. The effects were evaluated on the basis of a double blind trial. After the endoscopic diagnosis repeated examinations were practiced until three weeks after the beginning of the treatment. The best results were found in duodenal ulcers after treatment with Renitidin. 86,6% of the ulcers were healed after 3 weeks of treatment. This results was statistically significant compared with a group of patients treated with a placebo. With gastrozepin 77,2% of patients were successfully treated. In ulcers of the stomach the results were not so good and statistically insignificant. Side effects were not found. Until now it is not possible to decide which substance guarantees better results.", 
    "62": "An enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase (alpha-amino-acyl-peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.11.11) has been purified from human plasma and has been shown to be the principle responsible for the transient half-life of enkephalin in blood. An inhibitory effect of beta-carbolines and of 3,4-dihydro-beta-carbolines on this enzyme 'in vitro' is reported. The best inhibitor is the 3-carboxylic acid (Ki congruent to 10(-4) M), while the ester, amide, and/or peptide derivatives are less potent. Since some beta-carboline derivatives have recently been shown to possess high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in brain, the action of diazepam on the aminopeptidase activity was tested and a relevant inhibition of the human enzyme could be demonstrated.", 
    "63": "GABA and benzodiazepine receptors were solubilized from bovine cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus and then partially purified by gel filtration and characterized. The apparent molecular weights of all these receptors were determined to be 600,000-650,000 by gel filtration, the sedimentation coefficients being 11.0-11.3 S by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. [3H]Muscimol was bound to two classes of sites in fractions from all three regions, and [3H]flunitrazepam bound to one class of sites. A comparison of the ratios of Bmax for flunitrazepam binding to Bmax for muscimol binding revealed that the fractions from the hippocampus exhibited a much higher ratio of benzodiazepine binding sites than were detected in fractions from the cortex and cerebellum. GABA agonist and antagonist inhibited [3H]muscimol binding to the fractions from these regions, at similar concentrations. Benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists also inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding in these three fractions, with similar potency. CL 218,872, however, inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the cerebellar fraction with the lowest IC50 value and that in th hippocampal fraction with the highest IC50 value. Hill coefficients for CL 218,872 inhibition were 0.98, 0.64, and 0.58 for cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus, respectively.", 
    "64": "The influence of some serotoninergic agents on nitrazepam-induced sleep was studied in 5-8-day-old chicks. Nitrazepam (0.4-51.2 mg/kg) induced behavioural sleep in chicks dose-dependently. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; 10-20 mg/kg) hypnotised young chicks. Similarly, 5-HT (5-20 mg/kg) shortened the onset and significantly prolonged the duration of nitrazepam-induced sleep in chicks and increased the proportion of chicks that were hypnotized by nitrazepam; these effects were dose-dependent. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP; 2-8 mg/kg) did not induce sleep but dose-dependently shortened the onset and profoundly prolonged the duration of nitrazepam (1.6 mg/kg)-induced sleep. Cyproheptadine (0.5-2 mg/kg) delayed the onset of nitrazepam sleep and reduced the proportion of chicks that were hypnotized by nitrazepam. Parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 200 mg/kg) completely blocked nitrazepam-induced sleep. Nitrazepam sleep was associated with synchronization of the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the hyperstriatum, optic tectum and pontine reticular formation. 5-HT synchronized the EEG of the hyperstriatum and the pontine reticular formation while the electromyograph (EMG) activity was profoundly reduced. These behavioural and electrocortical data suggest that 5-HT may be involved in nitrazepam-induced sleep in young chicks.", 
    "65": "Hair copper and zinc contents were measured in 95 handicapped children aged from 4 to 17 years and 48 age- and sex-matched control children. The patients consisted of 5 groups: children untreated with anticonvulsants (n = 7), those treated with phenytoin and phenobarbital (n = 32), those treated with phenytoin, phenobarbital and diazepam (n = 18), those treated with diazepam alone (n = 16) and those treated with phenobarbital alone (n = 12). The patients were all institutionalized in the same medical care unit and received the same diet, containing decreased amounts of copper (75% of control) and sufficient amounts of zinc. The patients belonging to all of the 5 groups had less amounts of hair copper (p less than 0.05) and erythrocyte hemoglobin (p less than 0.01) in comparison to controls. The patients receiving diazepam alone or in addition to other anticonvulsants had significantly less hair zinc content (p less than 0.05) in comparison to controls or other patient groups. Thus, diazepam seemed to have an adverse effect, producing zinc deficiency."
