These findings suggest that a separation of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines is possible and that drugs with increased clinical specificity could be developed.",

Monoanesthesia with ketamine essentially increased the level of tHb and rSO2 and decreased the oxidized Cytaa3 fraction. Combined induction with ketamine and midazolame and propofol induction did not cause notable changes in the values of cerebral oxymetry.",

Awakening after anesthesia was evaluated by the following parameters: time between the end of intervention and extubation of the trachea, opening the eyes when asked, transportation from the operation room into the ward, and first dialogue with the doctor. A system of evaluating the level of recovery of respiration, motor activity, and consciousness by Aldret and Kroulik's score was used for objective assessment of the data. Postoperative pain and discomfort were evaluated using Hannallah's score in all age groups. The most rapid recovery of muscle tone, defense reflexes, and higher functions of the brain was observed in the patients anesthesized with propofol; adequate doses of narcotic analgetics during short-term interventions ensured satisfactory analgesia and psychological condition during the immediate postoperative period.", 
    "5": "Tetanus is an acute neurological disease characterized by muscle rigidity and spasms, autonomic dysfunction and in severe forms requires respiratory and hemodynamic support. Though it is entirely preventable by immunization, it still occurs in developing countries causing significant morbidity and mortality. Intensive care management of tetanus is fraught with problems of ventilator-associated pneumonia, nosocomial sepsis and a variety of other complications. Various treatment protocols have been tried in managing diverse manifestations of severe tetanus but the consensus is yet to emerge. In this review we have discussed the pathophysiology, clinical features and management controversies and suggest on basis of our experience use of high dose diazepam (20-120 mg/kg/day) and vecuronium with mechanical ventilation if required for control of spasms, and early detection of autonomic dysfunction and use of propranolol, in our circumstances.", 
    "6": "The aim of this study was to assess, by positron emission tomography (PET), the effect on cerebral functional activity of a new lorazepam-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) conjugate [3-(4-acetamido)-butyrril lorazepam (DDS2700)]. Ten healthy volunteers were studied by PET and [18F]fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) under baseline conditions and following the administration of DDS2700. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by PET and 15O-water in three additional participants while they performed attentive tasks, before and after drug administration. DDS2700 induced a decrease in the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu) in the thalamus (-17%), cerebellum (-11%) and caudate nucleus (-8%). The observed effects on glucose metabolism were probably related to the subjective sedation and tiredness reported by the participants. During the attentive tasks, rCBF increased in frontal and temporal regions associated with attentional processing of auditory material. These circuits were no longer active after DDS2700 administration, while rCBF increased in cingulate cortex, occipitoparietal regions, pons and cerebellum. These drug-induced activations might be directly related to intervening sleepiness and to the consequent effort in keeping attention focused on the tasks. The effects of DDS2700 on glucose metabolism at rest, and on rCBF during activation conditions, indicate a drug action on cerebral networks involved in alertness, vigilance and attention maintenance. PET assessment by [18F]FDG and water may provide complementary information in pharmacodynamic studies.", 
    "7": "Benzodiazepines have been the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of anxiety over the last 4 decades. The problems associated with their use prompted the research for alternative agents that would be useful in anxiety conditions. Old classes of antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, showed effectiveness in some anxiety syndromes, even in areas where benzodiazepines were not very effective. Newer antidepressants, the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, also appear very useful in some anxiety states, and their favourable side-effect profile has elevated them to first-line treatment tools in these conditions. However, the ideal anxiolytic does not exist. Research with other new compounds is very active, and some experimental drugs show promise for the future.", 
    "8": "Preclinical drug safety evaluation studies, typically conducted in two or more animal species, reveal and define dose-dependent toxicities and undesirable effects related to pharmacological mechanism of action. Idiosyncratic toxic responses are often not detected during this phase in development due to their relative rarity in incidence and differences in species sensitivity. This paper reviews and discusses the metabolic idiosyncratic toxicity and species differences observed for the experimental non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, panadiplon. This compound produced evidence of hepatic toxicity in Phase 1 clinical trial volunteers that was not predicted by rat, dog or monkey preclinical studies. However, subsequent studies in Dutch-belted rabbits revealed a hepatic toxic syndrome consistent with a Reye's Syndrome-like idiosyncratic response. Investigations into the mechanism of toxicity using rabbits and cultured hepatocytes from several species, including human, provided a sketch of the complex pathway required to produce hepatic injury. This pathway includes drug metabolism to a carboxylic acid metabolite (cyclopropane carboxylic acid), inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, and effects on intermediary metabolism including depletion of glycogen and disruption of glucose homeostasis. We also provide evidence suggesting that the carboxylic acid metabolite decreases the availability of liver CoA and carnitine secondary to the formation of unusual acyl derivatives. Hepatic toxicity could be ameliorated by administration of carnitine, and to a lesser extent by pantothenate. These hepatocellular pathway defects, though not directly resulting in cell death, rendered hepatocytes sensitive to secondary stress, which subsequently produced apoptosis and hepatocellular necrosis. Not all rabbits showed evidence of hepatic toxicity, suggesting that individual or species differences in any step along this pathway may account for idiosyncratic responses. These differences may be roughly applied to other metabolic idiosyncratic hepatotoxic responses and include variations in drug metabolism, effects on mitochondrial function, nutritional status, and health or underlying disease.", 
    "9": "Stimulus-response (S-R) properties of the corticospinal system in humans depend on the interactions that take place at different sites along the corticospinal pathway. The mechanisms influencing stimulus-response curves elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and their operation site along the human neuraxis are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of CNS-active drugs with distinct mechanisms of action on S-R curves. Effects of each of these drugs on S-R curves would point to the involvement of specific mechanisms. Additionally, relative sensitivity of S-R curves compared with other measures of corticospinal excitability was studied.",

Maximum peripheral M responses and F waves were investigated as measures of the total alpha-motoneuron pool and its excitability.", 
    "11": "F and M waves were unaffected by either the drugs or placebo. S-R curves were significantly depressed by lorazepam and lamotrigine without changes in ICI and ICF. Both S-R curves and ICF were enhanced by D-amphetamine. MT increased only with lamotrigine.",

    "13": "The history of antipsychotic medications begins in the 1950s with chlorpromazine, developed originally as an antihistamine but found to be an aid in the reduction of symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. This phenothiazine derivative was followed by numerous others in the same class (e.g., thioridazine) and then by antipsychotics in other classes (e.g., the popular haloperidol of the butyrophenone class). This group of medications is associated with a number of unpleasant side effects and complications. These included extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), orthostatic hypotension, hyperprolactinemia and last, but certainly not least, tardive dyskinesia (TD). As a consequence, other alternative antipsychotics were developed in which D(2) blockade effect generally associated with EPS and TD was offset by 5-HT(2) antagonism. The first of this class was clozapine; however, it is associated with agranulocytopenia of sudden onset as well as seizure induction. However, olanzapine, a close structural relative, was soon synthesised for treatment of psychosis and particularly schizophrenia (Zyprexatrade mark, Eli Lilly). It was released in the US in November 1996 with FDA approval for that indication. However, antipsychotics have always been used for other psychiatric disorders, aside from schizophrenia. This includes, in particular, mania, where chlorpromazine use predated lithium as an effective treatment. Other uses for antipsychotics have included other mood disorders, dementia, childhood disorders and personality problems. Here, information on the application of olanzapine to non-schizophrenic disorders is reviewed. Despite the fact that the research post-dates FDA approval in 1996, there was already sufficient evidence for olanzapine's effectiveness in acute mania to obtain approval from the US FDA in March 2000. Other research supports its use as adjunctive therapy in depressive disorders. Phase IV studies and case reports have found limited support for olanzapine's use in a variety of other psychiatric disorders, behavioural disorders of dementia (including Alzheimer's disease), pervasive developmental disorder of childhood, obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder. In each of these latter diagnoses, double-blind studies are either underway or are planned to establish efficacy.",

    "19": "It is now well established that prior test experience can alter behavioural baselines and attenuate/abolish the anxiolytic efficacy of benzodiazepines in the elevated plus-maze paradigm. In view of evidence that different models of anxiety measure qualitatively distinct forms of anxiety-like behaviour, it is important to establish whether the effects of prior experience extend to other widely-used tests. The present study assessed the behavioural and pharmacological sequelae of a single undrugged prior exposure to the light/dark exploration (L/D) test in mice, using ethological scoring methods. One group of adult male Swiss-Webster mice was given a single undrugged exposure to the L/D test 24 h prior to drug testing, while another group was completely na\u00efve to the apparatus. On test day, half the animals in each experiential condition were treated with saline and half with an anxiolytic dose (10 mg/kg) of chlordiazepoxide (CDP). When administered to test-na\u00efve animals, CDP induced a clear reduction in anxiety-like behaviour as evidenced by significant increases in exploration of the light compartment (line crossings, % line crossings, and % time) as well as reductions in stretched attend postures (SAPs) and the proportion of SAPs displayed toward the light compartment. The behavioural specificity of these effects was confirmed by the absence of a drug effect on line crossings in the dark compartment, total rearing and grooming. In complete contrast, with the sole exception of a decrease in total SAPs, CDP was without significant behavioural effect in test-experienced mice. As prior test experience did not significantly alter behavioural baselines in the L/D test, a second experiment was designed to investigate the possibility that handling/intraperitoneal injection may have precluded detection of experientially-induced changes in baseline behaviour. Results showed that handling/injection had no effect upon L/D behavioural profiles in either test-na\u00efve or test-experienced subjects, and confirmed that prior experience itself did not modify the primary indices of anxiety in this test. Present data indicate that prior test experience seriously compromises the anxiolytic efficacy of CDP (10 mg/kg) in the mouse L/D test and, together with recent findings in the four-plate test, appear to confirm that an experientially-induced reduction in sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines is by no means unique to the elevated plus-maze.",

    "35": "Neuropathic pain, the result of neurological damage in part of the nerve transmission system for pain, is one of the commonest painful syndromes in clinical practice and is a challenge for both neurologists and pain specialists. In recent years there has been increasing interest in the antiepileptic drugs, which were already used in this context in the sixties. Interest has increased with new drugs and better understanding of the physiopathogenic mechanisms of pain. The poor, variable response of these conditions to different treatments and the complex relationship between aetiologies, mechanisms and symptoms make it advisable to modify the traditional approach to the treatment of these conditions, passing form the aetiology and topographical distribution to the probable mechanisms involved in each individual patient, adapting the treatment to the individual concerned.", 
    "36": "The antiepileptic drugs are one of the most promising approaches to the drug treatment of neuropathic pain. Their use as the sole treatment, or in combination with other treatment, in individual patients depends on better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the genesis and maintenance of neuropathic pain and how antiepileptic drugs act on these mechanisms.",

    "40": "Panic attacks showed EEG thetha activity, increased amplitude of the negative phase of LEP, and an increase in the frequency of EUA in cortico-subcortical organizations. This changes occurred in all organizations with exception of the inhibitory reticular substance. Panic disorder produced abundance of repetitive epileptiform discharges that could precipitate convulsive crisis. Both benzodiazepines were efficacious although results with clonazepam were observed earlier: at 7 to 14 days. Benzodiazepines increased corticosubcortical EEG beta activity, decreased amplitude of negative phase of LEP, and diminution in the frequency of EUA. This changes occurred with exception on the inhibitory reticular system. We postulate: a) That panic disorder hyperexcitability at the cortico-subcortical neuronal level may be the result of gabergic dysfunction, or alteration in neuroinhibitory mechanism through GABAA receptors, and through GABAB neuromodulator receptors, and b) That there is a direct correlation between GABA inhibitory basic mechanism and electroencephalographic beta activity.",

    "42": "The results of several recent papers have shown a significant influence of the endogenous neurotransmitters on the exogenous ligand kinetics measured by positron emission tomography. For example, several groups found that the percentage of D2 receptor sites occupied by the endogenous dopamine ranged from 25% to 40% at basal level. An obvious consequence of this significant occupancy is that the ligand-receptor model parameters, usually estimated by a model that does not take into account the endogenous ligand (EL) kinetics, can be significantly biased. In the current work, the authors studied the biases obtained by using the multiinjection approach. The results showed that in the classical ligand-receptor model, the receptor concentration is correctly estimated and that only the apparent affinity is biased by not taking the EL into account. At present, all absolute quantifications of the EL have been obtained through pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous transmitter concentration, which is often too invasive a method to be used in patients. A theoretical reasoning showed that a noninvasive approach is necessarily based on both the apparent affinity measurement and on a multiregion approach. The correlation between the receptor concentration and the apparent affinity, previously observed with some ligands, verifies these two conditions; thus, the authors suggest that this correlation could be the result of the EL effect. To test this assumption experimentally, the effect of reserpine-induced dopamine depletion on the interactions between the D2 receptor sites and the FLB 457 is studied. With untreated baboons, the apparent FLB 457 affinity was smaller in the receptor-rich regions (striatum) than in the receptor-poor regions. This discrepancy disappeared after dopamine depletion, strongly suggesting that this affinity difference was related to the EL effect. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to test the ability to quantify the EL based on the observed correlation between the receptor concentration and the apparent affinity. This approach offers a method for estimating the percentage of receptor sites occupied by the EL and, if its affinity is known, the free EL concentration. From the data obtained using FLB 457 with baboons, the authors found that approximately 53% of the D2 receptor sites are occupied by dopamine in the striatum and that the free dopamine concentration is approximately 120 nmol/L at basal level. This approach is transferable to patients, because the experimental data are obtained without pharmacologically induced modification of the EL.", 
    "43": "Metabolic control often deteriorates during puberty in girls with insulin-dependent diabetes. It is well accepted that there is an abnormality in the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-I (lGF-I) axis in these girls, resulting in reduced IGF-I levels and elevated GH. As GH antagonizes insulin, attempts have previously been made to reduce excess GH secretion through anticholinergic treatment. However, most of these studies have been performed on adult patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of 12 wk of oral anticholinergic treatment with Pirenzepine, 100 mg twice daily, in 16 adolescent girls with diabetes. Serum samples of IGF-I, glycated haemoglobin and fasting IGF-binding protein 1 were analysed at initiation and after 3, 8 and 12 wk of Pirenzepine therapy. Nocturnal urinary GH excretion was also examined. Glycated haemoglobin declined significantly after 3 wk of Pirenzepine therapy (9.8 +/- 0.18 vs 9.2 +/- 0.17; p < 0.001) and was still improved at the end of the study. Unexpectedly, nocturnal urinary GH excretion did not change. Serum IGF-I continuously increased during the study, while IGF-binding protein 1 levels were not significantly altered.", 
    "44": "Anticholinergic treatment with Pirenzepine improves glycaemic control in adolescent girls with diabetes. Although nocturnal urinary GH excretion was unchanged there may still be changes in pituitary GH secretion to explain the improvement.

    "45": "This study compared the discharge rates and drug costs of 789 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who began pharmacotherapy with olanzapine or risperidone between July 1997 and June 1998. Discharge rates 30 days after the start of treatment were 45 percent for the patients treated with risperidone and 32 percent for those treated with olanzapine (p=.001). Daily drug costs during the same period were $6.42 for risperidone and $12.29 for olanzapine (p<.001). For risperidone, lower dosages were associated with higher hospital discharge rates, whereas no significant association was observed for olanzapine. These data suggest that among inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, use of risperidone results in a higher discharge rate and a lower drug cost than use of olanzapine.",

Glutamate regulates proliferation and migration of neurons during development, but it is not known whether it influences proliferation and migration of tumor cells. We demonstrate that glutamate antagonists inhibit proliferation of human tumor cells. Colon adenocarcinoma, astrocytoma, and breast and lung carcinoma cells were most sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist dizocilpine, whereas breast and lung carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and neuroblastoma cells responded most favorably to the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate antagonist GYKI52466. The antiproliferative effect of glutamate antagonists was Ca(2+) dependent and resulted from decreased cell division and increased cell death. Morphological alterations induced by glutamate antagonists in tumor cells consisted of reduced membrane ruffling and pseudopodial protrusions. Furthermore, glutamate antagonists decreased motility and invasive growth of tumor cells. These findings suggest anticancer potential of glutamate antagonists.", 
    "51": "Seizure-induced neuronal death may be under the control of the caspase family of cell death proteases. We examined the role of caspase-2 in a model of focally evoked limbic seizures with continuous EEG recording. Seizures were elicited by microinjection of kainic acid into the amygdala of the rat and terminated after 40 min by diazepam. Caspase-2 was constitutively present in brain, mostly within neurons, and was detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Cleaved caspase-2 (12 kDa) was detected immediately following seizure termination within injured ipsilateral hippocampus, contiguous with increased Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp (VDVADase) activity, a putative measure of activated caspase-2. Expression of receptor interacting protein (RIP)-associated Ich-1-homologous protein with death domain (RAIDD) was increased following seizures, whereas expression of RIP and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated protein with death domain (TRADD), other components thought to be linked to the caspase-2 activation and signaling mechanism, were unchanged. Intracerebroventricular administration of z-VDVAD-fluoromethyl ketone blocked seizure-induced caspase-2 activity but did not alter caspase-8 activity and failed to affect DNA fragmentation or neuronal death. These data support activation of caspase-2 following seizures but suggest that parallel caspase pathways may circumvent deficits in caspase-2 function to complete the cell death process.", 
    "52": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder manifested by parkinsonism and dysfunction of autonomic, cerebellar, urinary, and pyramidal systems. The most frequent presentation is with a combination of parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction, but cerebellar ataxia with autonomic failure occurs frequently as well. Striatonigral degeneration (SND) and sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy (sOPCA) can progress to include autonomic failure and thus may be forms of MSA, but it is not known whether all such cases progress to MSA. Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) with various ligands, my colleagues and I have investigated the biochemical changes in sOPCA and MSA to understand the relationship between these disorders. An initial study revealed decreased local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in the brainstem, cerebellum, putamen, thalamus and cerebral cortex in both MSA and sOPCA, suggesting that many sOPCA patients would evolve to develop MSA. Later studies confirmed this by demonstrating decreased monoaminergic nigrostriatal terminals in both sOPCA and MSA patients. The studies suggest that the ligand used might be helpful in determining the risk that an individual patient with sOPCA will progress to develop MSA. An investigation of the course of sOPCA patients observed clinically over several years revealed that approximately one-fourth of them progress to MSA within five years. Studies of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A/benzodiazepine neurotransmitter receptors revealed that these sites are largely preserved in sOPCA and MSA, indicating that symptomatic pharmacological therapy may be possible in these disorders.",

Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that valproate has an apparent elimination half life of 17 minutes in rats after acute administration and that there is a nonlinear relationship between chronic dose and serum drug concentration. Acute valproate treatment neither altered plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticosterone concentrations nor produced changes in CRF concentration in any of 10 brain regions examined. Subchronic treatment via SC-implanted osmotic minipumps (875 mg/kg/day x 7 days) resulted in decreased CRF concentrations in the median eminence and raphe nuclei. Moreover, CRF mRNA expression was decreased in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. The benzodiazepine alprazolam, also a positive modulator of GABAergic function, similarly decreases CRF mRNA expression in the CeA. These results suggest that the mood stabilizing effects of valproic acid may be mediated in part by alterations in CRF neuronal activity.",

A multivariate analysis identified seven characteristics significantly associated with syringe borrowing. These included early school leaving and parental unemployment. IDUs with long injecting histories who had injected less frequently were more likely to borrow. Injection of more than one substance was significantly associated with borrowing of syringes. Syringe borrowing was associated with having more intimate social relationships with other IDUs, less perceived risk in borrowing from acquaintances and usually opting to inject in the company of other IDUs.", 
    "61": "Syringe borrowing is commonly practised by young IDUs. Those with a background of social deprivation are more likely to engage in this risk behaviour. IDUs who report borrowing are more intimately involved with other IDUs and tend to perceive less risk or dangerousness in borrowing. In addition to syringe exchange, there is a need to work cognitively with IDUs to identify and challenge assumptions that they may have regarding the safety involved in borrowing from others, particularly from those with whom they have close social relationships.",

For binary outcomes a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Where possible, the weighted number needed to treat statistic (NNT), and its 95% confidence interval (CI), was also calculated. If heterogeneity was found, a random effects model was used. For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. Non-skewed data from valid scales were summated using a weighted mean difference (WMD).

None compared clotiapine with placebo, but control drugs were either antipsychotics (chlorpromazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine and zuclopenthixol acetate) or benzodiazepines (lorazepam). Versus antipsychotics: results for global clinical outcome were heterogeneous (p=0.09) but did not suggest clotiapine to be superior, or inferior, to chlorpromazine, perphenazine, or trifluoperazine (total randomised = 83). Use of clotiapine did change the proportion of people ready for hospital discharge by the end of the study in one small trial (n=49, RR 1.04 95%CI 0.96 to 2.12). Overall, attrition rates were low. No significant difference was found for those allocated to clotiapine compared with people randomised to other antipsychotics (n=121, RR 2.26 95%CI 0.40 to 13). Weak data suggests that clotiapine may result in less need for antiparkinsonian treatment compared with zuclopenthixol acetate (n=38, RR 0.43 95%CI 0.02 to 0.98). Versus lorazepam: when used to control aggressive/violent outbursts for people already treated with haloperidol, clotiapine did not significantly improve mental state compared to lorazepam (WMD -3.36 95%CI -8.09 to 1.37).

Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was low in both groups, with no between-group differences. Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores and scores on the five Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors were improved in both groups at week 8 (subjects who completed the study) and endpoint (all subjects, including dropouts). There were overall between-treatment differences in efficacy. Comparison of individual factors found no significant differences at endpoint; at week 8, however, improvements on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors for positive symptoms and anxiety/depression were greater with risperidone than olanzapine. An increase in body weight of > or =7% was seen in 27% of olanzapine participants and 12% of risperidone participants.",

Isoflurane-fentanyl-diazepam MAC (0.48+/-0.29%) was significantly less than isoflurane-fentanyl-saline MAC (0.79+/-0.21%). Percentage reduction in isoflurane MAC was significantly greater for fentanyl-diazepam (74%), compared with fentanyl-saline (54%) or fentanyl-flumazenil (61%). Mean fentanyl concentrations for the entire experiment were increased over time and were higher in the diazepam group than the saline or flumazenil groups.",

After precipitation of protein and red cells with a mixture of organic solvents (methanol/acetonitrile, 50:50), the aliquot is centrifuged and the organic upper phase evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The residue is reconstituted by adding 500 microL of a mixture of phosphate buffer (20mM, pH 2.2) and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v). The sample is then directly introduced into the column-switching column. The precolumn is first washed with phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. Compounds retained on the precolumn are then eluted in the back-flush mode and separated on a C8 semi-microcolumn (Lichrospher select B, 125 x 3 mm). The BZD studied are determined by a diode-array detector at 254 nm. The method shows excellent linearity between 25 and 1,000 ng/mL for clonazepam, flunitrazepam, and midazolam and between 25 and 5,000 ng/mL for diazepam and oxazepam. The recoveries are around 80% for clonazepam and oxazepam and around 90% for the three others. Coefficients of variation for between-day and within-day assays are < 15% for low concentrations close to the limit of quantitation and < 5% for high concentrations.",

The samples of hair were washed twice with dichloromethane and cut into 1-mm segments prior to extraction with methanol at 45 degrees C for 18 h. The extracts were split into two parts; both were evaporated to dryness. One half of the extract was derivatized using MBTFA for analysis of amphetamines, and the other half was derivatized using MTBSTFA for analysis of the remaining drugs. The extracts were analyzed using electron impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry operating in selected ion monitoring mode. In total, 18 drugs of abuse/metabolites could be detected.

    "85": "Benzodiazepine-type drugs are used in the treatment of a number of pathologic disorders, but they may be implicated in forensic toxicology cases because of their abuse potential. Occasionally, it becomes necessary to measure drug levels following exposure to formaldehyde (postembalming or after tissue storage) if drug involvement was not previously suspected. Virtually no information exists on the decomposition of benzodiazepines in the presence of formaldehyde (the active ingredient in many embalming fluids), yet formaldehyde is known to be highly reactive, particularly with nitrogen-containing compounds. In order to evaluate the effects of formaldehyde on benzodiazepines, 10 benzodiazepine drugs were exposed to various concentrations of formaldehyde and various pH conditions (to simulate potential postembalming conditions), and the decomposition of each drug was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography over a 30-day period. The decomposition rates of all but one of the benzodiazepines were accelerated (to differing degrees) by formaldehyde as compared to controls, and this decomposition was in several cases both pH and formaldehyde concentration dependent. Thus, forensic examiners must be particularly cautious when attempting to determine benzodiazepine concentrations postembalming because the compound may have reacted with formaldehyde to form other products not inherently obvious analytically. Determination of these reaction products will serve to provide alternate analytes, allowing for establishment of accurate conclusions during forensic analyses.",

Case records were secondarily reviewed by an expert group. Actual flumazenil use during hospitalization was compared to currently recommended indications. In order to evaluate the efficacy of flumazenil use, patients who received flumazenil were matched with those who did not and effects on mortality, morbidity, number of costly procedures (CT scan, diagnostic toxicology, etc.) and duration of hospital stay were determined.",

Twenty-nine patients (6%) received flumazenil in the emergency department whereas the expert reviewers recommended flumazenil use in only 18 (3.7%). In 11/29 (38%) cases, the use of fumazenil was considered inappropriate. The expert group considered flumazenil to be contraindicated in 93 of 478 patients. Nonetheless, flumazenil was used in 11 patients (rate of potentially harmful flumazenil use: 11/93; 12%), and a severe complication occurred in one of these patients after flumazenil.

    "90": "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a well-defined symptom complex and is frequently associated with sleep disturbance and a recognized family history. It occurs either as idiopathic RLS or in association with many medical, neurological or vascular disorders. The neurological examination and routine investigations in idiopathic RLS are normal. Polysomnography supports the diagnosis of RLS by documenting the associated sleep disturbances and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). Although MRI studies disclose no intracerebral lesions, recent Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies point to some involvement of the basal and red nuclei and the cerebellum. No definitive etiology is known for this condition, but several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. There is supportive evidence that RLS is a Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction, suggesting widespread involvement of the descending dopaminergic (DA) pathways, possibly originating in the diencephalon or upper brainstem. This is corroborated by the successful treatment of RLS with DA agents, sedatives, and neurotransmitters. However, RLS can also occur with spinal disorders and spinal cord lesions implying the existence of a spinal generator. The incidence of RLS in pregnancy is well known and its association with vascular disorders supports another mechanism in some patients. The primary treatment of RLS is largely symptomatic and quite effective with DA agents, DA agonists, opioids and other neurotransmitters. The treatment of RLS associated with various diseases is aimed at the correction of the underlying pathological or deficiency states. Antidepressant medications frequently precipitate or worsen the condition of RLS.", 
    "91": "Epilepsies affect at least 2% of the population at some time in life, and many forms have genetic determinants. We have found a mutation in a gene encoding a GABA(A) receptor subunit in a large family with epilepsy. The two main phenotypes were childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and febrile seizures (FS). There is a recognized genetic relationship between FS and CAE, yet the two syndromes have different ages of onset, and the physiology of absences and convulsions is distinct. This suggests the mutation has age-dependent effects on different neuronal networks that influence the expression of these clinically distinct, but genetically related, epilepsy phenotypes. We found that the mutation in GABRG2 (encoding the gamma2-subunit) abolished in vitro sensitivity to diazepam, raising the possibility that endozepines do in fact exist and have a physiological role in preventing seizures.", 
    "92": "1. Mobilization of histamine from the ECL cells was monitored by gastric submucosal microdialysis in conscious rats. The ECL cells are known to operate under gastrin control and the purpose of the present study was to examine their in situ response to short-term (12 h) as well as long-term (28 days) hypergastrinaemia, induced by treatment with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole. 2. Hypergastrinaemia promptly raised the histamine concentration in the microdialysate. The effect was prevented by CCK(2) receptor blockade (YF476). On day 7 of omeprazole treatment the microdialysate histamine concentration reached a peak, five times higher than before treatment. Subsequently (14 and 28 days), less histamine was mobilized. 3. Gastrin infusion (4 h) raised the microdialysate histamine concentration in a dose-dependent manner in fasted rats and freely fed rats and in rats treated with omeprazole for a week. However, while fasted and fed rats responded to low doses of gastrin, the omeprazole-treated rats required large doses of gastrin to respond. 4. When the amount of histamine mobilized was related to the serum gastrin concentration the following EC(50) values could be calculated: fasted rats 2.3 x 10(-10) M, freely fed rats 2.5 x 10(-10) M, omeprazole-treated rats 8.7 x 10(-10) M. The maximal histamine responses in the three groups were 18.4 pmol 4 h(-1)+/-0.8, 21.9 pmol 4 h(-1)+/-1.2 and 68.0 pmol 4 h(-1)+/-3.5, respectively. 5. The results suggest that ECL cells, exposed to a high gastrin concentration for a week, respond with a shift in the receptor-ligand binding affinity from high to low. Apparently, CCK(2) receptors of the ECL cells are subject to dynamic changes with respect to ligand-binding affinity.", 
    "93": "Effects of midazolam intraperitoneally (3.0 mg/kg) administered, or locally applied into lateral septal nuclei (10 microg/microl), or into the medial septum (10 microg/microl) were assessed in Wistar rats during late proestrus or metestrus-diestrus in a conflict-operant task. A reduction in conflict behavior was found in control rats during late proestrus (P<.05), when compared to metestrus-diestrus. Systemic injections of midazolam (P<.05) or midazolam infusions into lateral septal nuclei (P<.05) also reduced conflict behavior only during late proestrus, whereas midazolam infusions into the medial septum produced neither of these anticonflict effects in any estrous phase. In conclusion, an endocrine-related variation in anticonflict effects of midazolam microinjected into lateral septal nuclei was displayed by female rats.", 
    "94": "This study examined the effect of acute ethanol administration as compared to diazepam on the number of rearing events and the number of steps ascended in the mouse staircase test, an animal model sensitive to benzodiazepines. Acute ethanol administration, similar to acute diazepam administration, reduces rearing (at doses that do not reduce climbing) in the staircase test. This effect of acute ethanol administration is insensitive to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil and is not consistently counteracted by the partial inverse agonist Ro15-4513. It seems that the mouse staircase test is an efficient paradigm for studying agents active at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor complex, including ethanol.",

One hundred ten patients admitted to treatment for substance misuse were assessed using a semistructured clinical interview, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Symptom CheckList-90, the Trail Making A and B tests, and the Shipley Institute of Living Scale. Results revealed that at intake, alcohol- and benzodiazepine-addicted clients exhibited higher levels of cognitive impairment and psychological distress than patients dependent on other drugs. Regression analysis showed that the Shipley vocabulary raw score was a significant predictor of length of stay in treatment.", 
    "96": "Rats exposed to SART (specific alternation of rhythm in temperature) stress, which are ideal animal models for vagotonia-type dysautonomia, show various changes in cardiac and circulatory systems. In this study, attention was directed to cholinergic function in the SART-stressed rat heart and the effects of AF-DX 116, a specific muscarinic M2 antagonist, on blood pressure and heart rate. The results were compared with those obtained for atropine and pirenzepine. In SART-stressed rats, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were lower than in unstressed rats. Oral AF-DX 116 resulted in greater elevation of DBP than SBP in unstressed rats. In stressed rats, greater and more prolonged elevation of SBP than in unstressed rats was noted, particularly at higher doses. A dose-dependent SBP change in stressed rats, caused by intravenous AF-DX 116, was shifted upward in parallel with that in unstressed groups, unlike with oral administration. The positive chronotropic effect of this drug was smaller in stressed rats than in unstressed rats, in contrast to the pressor effect. SART-stressed rats may thus have an enhanced sympathetic tone in the heart, as well as changes in muscarinic M2 receptors at sympathetic nerve endings and at the heart muscle. The effects of AF-DX 116 on blood pressure and heart rate thus may arise from peripheral action and AF-DX 116 may be useful for treating hypotension related to autonomic imbalance of the vagotonia type.", 
    "97": "In the present investigation, antagonistic action of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) against morphine on the electrical and contractile activity of rat jejunum in vitro was studied. The results showed that the potentiation of acetylcholine (ACh) on both the burst of spike and the contractility were inhibited by morphine, which could be completely antagonized by CCK-8. The CCK-8 effect, again, could be suppressed by CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (10 nmol/L), but partially by CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365, 260 at 10 nmol/L or completely at concentration of 30 nmol/L. The above results demonstrated that the antagonism of CCK-8 on morphine was mediated by both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors.",

The catalepsy of mice induced by Ola was also investigated. The single unit extracellular recording technique was used to compare the spontaneous firing rate changes of dopamine (DA) cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA, A10) and the substantia nigra pars compact (SNC, A9) in rats after i.v.

In a conditioned avoidance paradigm in mice, Ola inhibited the avoidance response with an ED50 of 2.72 mg.kg-1 (p.o.). However, the catalepsy was not induced by Ola in mice even under a very high dose of 100 mg.kg-1 (p.o.).

    "102": "Subjective and objective evaluation of pharmacological treatment was made in 105 schizophrenic in-patients. PANSS and Calgary scale as well as Van Putten scale were used. Fifty-four percent of subjects received classic neuroleptics and 46%--new atypical drugs for an average period of 8 weeks. The severity of schizophrenic symptoms during treatment as well as subjective evaluation of first effects of the drug did not differ among subjects treated with classic or atypical drugs. Depressive symptoms decreased significantly during treatment with atypicals but not with classic drugs. Also a significant decrease of depression was found under olanzapine treatment. The severity of neuroleptic-induced side-effects did not differ in both groups. Neurological side effects were more prominent in subjects after 4 weeks of therapy with risperidone, in comparison to patients receiving olanzapine. Forty-seven per-cent of patients showed a dysphoric reaction to the first dose of medication. After treatment with atypical drugs, better subjective evaluation of pharmacotherapy correlated with less severe general and depressive schizophrenia symptoms. Patients' better evaluation of olanzapine treatment correlated with less severe schizophrenic general symptomatology. The subjective evaluation of treatment was better in patients with less severe neurological side-effects of atypical drugs (including olanzapine but not risperidone) and less severe autonomic side-effects of classic drugs. The evaluation of pharmacotherapy made by patients' family members did not correlate with subjects' opinions after distribution of the first dose of the drugs, but correlated significantly with patients' opinion after 8-weeks of treatment. The treatment received by the patients was judged better by the family members if less severe neurological side-effects were present.",

Patients were examined with SCID-P for DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, version for patient, Y-BOCS and a specially prepared questionnaire for determining the age of onset, duration of OCD and a clinical picture of OCD. OCD was diagnosed in 13% adolescent patients with schizophrenia. Primary OCD--before schizophrenic symptoms was noted in 2.0% of patients, OCD together with schizophrenic symptoms in 4.5% of subjects, and while pharmacotherapy with various atypical neuroleptics: clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine in 6.0% of young patients. The most of assessed patients received clozapine (35 subjects), 24 subjects were treated with risperidone and 17 patients with olanzapine. It was determined that 14.3% of subjects used clozapine, 12.5% of subjects treated with risperidone and 5.9% treated with olanzapine presented OCD, where symptoms had appeared while in pharmacotherapy with these atypical neuroleptics. The differences were not statistically significant. OCD was not observed in these patients who had earlier treatment with classical neuroleptics (for example: haloperidol, perazine). It is possible that part of OCD in schizophrenic patients is induced by medication with new atypical neuroleptics, their influence on serotoninergic system, other, maybe the partial symptomatology of schizophrenia in a special subgroup of patients.", 
    "104": "The 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonist SB 206553 exerts anxiolytic effects in rat models of anxiety. However, these effects have been reported for standard rat strains, thus raising the issue of SB 206553 effects in rat strains displaying different levels of anxiety. Herein, the effects of SB 206553 in a 5-min elevated plus-maze test of anxiety were compared to those of the reference anxiolytic, diazepam, in two rat strains respectively displaying high (Lewis rats) and low (spontaneously hypertensive rats, SHR) anxiety. Diazepam (0.37, 0.75, or 1.5 mg/kg; 30 min before testing) increased in a dose-dependent manner the behavioral measures in SHR, but not in Lewis rats. On the other hand, SB 206553 (1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg; 30 min before testing) failed to alter the anxiety parameters in both strains, whereas it increased closed arm entries in Lewis rats, suggesting that it elicited hyperactivity in the latter strain. Accordingly, the hypolocomotor effect of the nonselective 5-HT2B/2C receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (1.5 mg/kg ip 20 min before a 15-min exposure to an activity cage) was prevented by the 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg doses of SB 206553 in Lewis rats and SHR, respectively. Compared with SHR, Lewis rats may display a lower response to benzodiazepine-mediated effects and a more efficient control of locomotor activity by 5-HT2B/2C receptors.", 
    "105": "Traditionally, the use of rodent models in assessing the carcinogenic potential of chemicals has been expensive and lengthy, and the relevance of the carcinogenic effect to humans is often not fully understood. Today, however, with the rapid advances in molecular biology, genetically altered mice containing genes relevant to humans (e.g. oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes) and reporter genes (e.g. lacI) provide powerful tools for examining specific chemical-gene interactions thereby allowing a better understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in a shorter period of time. This paper will cover an overview of ongoing validation efforts, followed by examples of studies using several genetically engineered models including the p53def mouse model and the Big Blue transgenic mouse model. Specifically, examples where transgenic models were integrated into the testing program based on specific hypotheses dealing with genetic alterations in cancer genes and reporter genes will be discussed. The examples will highlight possible ways genetically altered mice may be integrated into a comprehensive research and testing strategy and thereby provide an improved estimation of human health risks.",

The patient's pain was refractory to conventional pain treatments and she had persistent right hemi-body neuropathic pain with allodynia and hyperalgesia. An intravenous ketamine trial, followed by oral ketamine with titration to 50mg three times a day was beneficial in decreasing allodynia and hyperalgesia, as well as improving functional capabilities. Known side effects including dysphoria, hallucinations, and paranoid feelings were attenuated with benzodiazepines.", 
    "107": "This review deals with the concept of sleep mechanism based on our uridine receptor theory. It is well established that uridine is one of the sleep-promoting substances, we have, therefore, synthesized new types of hypnotic compounds from oxopyrimidine nucleosides. Their mechanism of action in CNS depressant effects is elucidated based on the receptor theory. In this study, structure-activity relationship for CNS depressant properties, sleep-promoting effects, interaction with certain CNS receptors, and receptor binding assay of uridine derivatives as oxopyrimidine nucleoside were investigated. In the studies of structure-activity relationship of N3-substituted uridine, we found for the first time that both N3-benzyluridine and N3-phenacyluridine synthesized exhibited potent hypnotic activity (loss of righting reflex) by intracerebroventicular injection in mice. Moreover, certain derivatives of these compounds possessed synergistic effects with barbiturate and benzodiazepine, and decreased in spontaneous activity, motor incoordination, and antianxiety effects in mice. Especially, N3-phenacyluridine markedly enhanced pentobarbital- and diazepam-induced sleep by 6- and 70-fold, respectively. However, N3-benzyluracil and N3-phenacyluracil that have no ribose moiety did not possess any hypnotic activity, indicating specific effects of nucleoside derivatives. Effects of N3-benzyluridine on natural sleep in rats were thus examined. N3-Benzyluridine also possessed the sleep promoting effect assessed by electrocorticogram at the dose of 10 pmol. For elucidating the mechanism of action of N3-phenacyluridine, the interactions of this compound with benzodiazepine, GABA, 5-HT, or adenosine receptors were also investigated. Although the pharmacological activity of N3-phenacyluridine was high, the affinities to benzodiazepine, GABA, 5-HT, and adenosine receptors were quite low. [3H]N3-Phenacyluridine concentration-dependently bound to synaptic membrane prepared from the bovine brain. The Scatchard analysis revealed a single component of the binding site. This binding site is proposed here as a novel receptor called \"uridine receptor\" for hypnotic activity of the uridine derivatives. The rank order of the distribution of these specific binding sites was found to be striatum > thalamus > cerebral cortex > cerebellum > mid brain > medulla oblongata in the rat brain. In the metabolic study of N3-phenacyluridine, we found that this compound was exclusively metabolized to N3-(S)-(+)-alpha-hydroxy-beta-phenethyluridine, but not the (R)- form, in mice. N3-(S)-(+)-alpha-Hydroxy-beta-phenylethyluridine possessed not only strong hypnotic activity but also a high affinity to the uridine receptor of synaptic membranes, while the (R)-isomer was low in both activities. Racemic mixture was shown to be intermediate for pharmacological effects of the compounds. These studies which used (R)- or (S)-isomer indicate that uridine binding site or uridine receptor, exists in the CNS and plays some role in sleep regulation in mammals as one of the triggering steps in inducing hypnotic activity. It is suggested that uridine is released from steps of nucleic acid-nucleic protein biosynthesis (catabolism), and reaches the binding sites in the areas of the brain which regulate natural sleep. The uridine dissociated from the receptor is then utilized for the synthesis of nucleic acid (anabolism). We propose here that the induction of sleep may be mediated by uridine through uridine receptor in the CNS, although the structure of uridine receptor is not yet elucidated.", 
    "108": "An investigation of prescription and consumption of hypnotic and anxiolytic drugs in hospital was carried out and has associated a transverse prescription study and a prospective consumption study. The prescription study was undertaken on one day in several medical departments of Sainte-Marguerite Hospital in Marseille in February 1999. Of the 91 hospitalized patients included, 42 (46 per cent) had been prescribed a hypnotic or anxiolytic. Furthermore, the quantities of drugs taken out of the pharmacy during the month of February were 1.54 time more than those prescribed. This discrepancy was even more obvious in the case of certain benzodiazepines such as bromazepam (ratio from 1 to 4) and lorazepam (ratio from 1 to 8). Self-prescription and patients being supplied without a prescription are the hypotheses advanced to explain this phenomenon.", 
    "109": "The effects of five anaesthetics on the corticosterone, cortisol and glucose concentrations were investigated in the NZW rabbit. Sixty animals were assigned to 6 treatment groups (n= 10 per group): control ( iv saline solution injection), ketamine (10 mg/kg iv) with either xylazine (3 mg/kg iv) or diazepam (2 mg/kg iv), pentobarbitone (30 mg/kg iv), thiopentone (20 mg/kg iv) and fentanyl/droperidol (1 mg/kg sc). Plasma glucocorticoids were measured by competitive enzymeimmunoassay EIA and glucose by an autoanalyzer, previously validated for this species in both cases. Blood samples were obtained at 6 time-points: before injection, at 10, 30, 60, 120 min and 24 h after injection of the anaesthetics/saline. A significant decrease of plasma glucocorticoids at 10-60 min was observed in the pentobarbitone and fentanyl/ droperidol groups, whereas the administration of ketamine/diazepam or thiopentone stimulated plasma glucocorticoid release, principally in the recovery period. However, in the ketamine/xylazine group no changes were observed in the glucocorticoid levels, except for a significative increase of cortisol at 60-120 min. Glucose levels significantly increased after ketamine/diazepam administration and principally, after ketamine/xylazine treatment. The present data suggest that ketamine/xylazine has little effect on glucocorticoid levels and provides an adequate level of surgical anaesthesia, hence it would be the anaesthetic of choice, although the hyperglycaemic effect after injection has to be considered for any experimental procedures in rabbits.",

    "111": "We undertook a data analysis of Health Canada's database of Adverse Drug Reactions to SSRIs from 1986 to 1996, as well as a literature review.", 
    "112": "Among the complete ADR reports in the SSRI database, there were no sex differences in occurrences of all ADRs (n = 1011), severe ADRs (n = 295), drug-drug interactions (n = 312), deaths (n = 87), or intentional overdoses (n = 79), when sex differences in prescription practices were considered. There were no differences in ADR rates among different SSRIs. The most common cause of death among patients taking SSRIs was intentional overdose (n = 65, 74.7%). This was reported in 47 (72.3%) women and 18 (27.7%) men. The most common drugs taken with SSRIs in patients who died of intentional overdoses were benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), narcotics, alcohol, and diphenhydramine. Patients who had severe or fatal ADRs were more likely to be taking an SSRI with 2 or more other drugs, including alcohol. Drug combinations that included another CYP-450 drug were especially problematic. A total of 129 cardiovascular ADRs were reported, most of which were severe. These included rhythm disturbances, blood pressure perturbations, and chest pain or angina. Cardiovascular ADRs most often occurred with concomitant drug use of benzodiazepines, TCAs, histamine H2 antagonists, lithium, and calcium channel blockers. There were 3 deaths from malignant neuroleptic syndrome unassociated with intentional overdose.", 
    "113": "SSRIs are relatively safe when their widespread use is compared with the prevalence of ADRs. SSRIs may, however, be associated with ADRs, and even death, following intentional overdose or when taken with 2 or more other drugs or alcohol (particularly another drug metabolized by CYP-450). Physicians prescribing SSRIs need to consider drug-drug interactions and carefully monitor patients with severe affective disorders, comorbid medical conditions (especially cardiovascular disease), alcohol abuse, or a history of overdosing.",

We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of donepezil augmentation in a schizoaffective disorder patient stabilized on olanzapine pharmacotherapy. The patient showed significant improvements in several cognitive measures and increased activation of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia on functional MRI during the donepezil augmentation. In addition, the donepezil augmentation resulted in a reduction of depressive symptoms and in significant improvements in functional abilities and quality of life. Further studies of donepezil augmentation of neuroleptics in schizophrenia are warranted.", 
    "115": "A simple procedure using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry has been developed for the determination of fluoroethylflumazenil metabolites. Samples were precipitated with acetonitrile, evaporated to dryness followed by reconstitution with methanol. As mobile phase, 50 mM ammonium formate-methanol (58:42, v/v) was used. The method is valid both for cold and radiolabelled metabolites. Various cold metabolites (hydroxylated and/or dealkylated) were identified in rat and human microsome preparations. Radiolabelled metabolites arise from two or more transformations including hydroxylation. The methodology developed can be applied for further characterisation of metabolites, and for the determination of non metabolised [18F]fluoroethylflumazenil in routine clinical analysis.",

Annual surveys lasting 4 weeks are performed with drug users in drug centres. Its usefulness is discussed using examples from the study: potential for antidepressant dependence (amineptine), monitoring benzodiazepine use and consumption associated with maintenance treatments. Flunitrazepam is the most consumed benzodiazepine and often got by deal (29%). There are important differences between buprenorphine consumption in a maintenance treatment context (9/10) and beyond this context (1/10). The main methodology problems encountered are representativeness and validity of data. The limits of the programme and its role in the French health care system are discussed.", 
    "117": "Nothing is known about the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on cardiac performance in fish. Using an in vitro working heart preparation that generates physiological values of output pressure, cardiac output and ventricular work and power, we assessed the effects of NO on the cardiac performance of the eel Anguilla anguilla. We examined basal cardiac performance (at constant preload, afterload and heart rate), the effects of cholinergic stimulation and the Frank-Starling response (preload-induced increases in cardiac output at constant afterload and heart rate). The NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and L-N5(1-iminoethyl)ornithine (L-NIO), the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo-(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) and Triton X-100, a detergent that damages the endocardial endothelium, all increased stroke volume (VS) and stroke work (WS). In contrast, the endogenous NOS substrate L-arginine, tested before and after treatment with haemoglobin, the NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine, tested with and without the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase, and the stable cGMP analogue 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) decreased VS and WS. Acetylcholine chloride produced a biphasic effect. At nanomolar concentrations, in 34 % of the preparations, it induced a NO-cGMP-dependent positive inotropism that required the integrity of the endocardial endothelium. Pretreatment with Triton X-100 or with NO-cGMP pathway inhibitors (L-NMMA, L-NIO, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, Methylene Blue and ODQ) abolished the positive effect of acetylcholine. In contrast, at micromolar concentrations, acetylcholine produced a negative effect that involved neither the endocardial endothelium nor the NO-cGMP pathway. Pre-treatment with L-arginine (10(-6 )mol x l(-1)) was without effect, whereas L-NIO (10(-5 )mol x l(-1)) significantly reduced the Frank-Starling response. Taken together, these three experimental approaches provide evidence that NO modulates cardiac performance in the eel heart.", 
    "118": "Gitelman's syndrome, also known as \"hypocalciuric variant of Bartter's syndrome\", is a cause of chronic hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia in adults. A specific gene has been found responsible for this disorder, encoding the thiazide-sensitive NaCl coporter (TSC) in the distal convoluted tubule. We describe a psychiatric patient with chronic symptomatic hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia whose electrolyte disturbances were subsequently misdiagnosed as an acute alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as chronic diuretic abuse and as a classical Bartter's syndrome. Finally, genetic investigation revealed the presence of mutations in the SLC12A3 gene leading to the proper diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome. We emphasize that Gitelman's syndrome should be suspected in every hypokalemic patient with biochemical resemblance of diuretic ingestion, especially when repeated toxic screens for diuretics are negative. The ability to make a molecular-genetic diagnosis can be of practical benefit in confusing clinical settings.", 
    "119": "The effect of fear and relief from fear on heart rate (HR) was studied in partially restrained adult male rats. The emotional state was influenced behaviorally with the use of Pavlovian aversive conditioning procedure, and pharmacologically by injections of the selected anxiolytics and anxiogenics. A signal of danger (DS)--light or tone, preceded tail-shock (excitatory trials), while a signal of safety (SS), respectively tone or light, overlapped last 3s of 5s DS and predicted an omission of this expected aversive event (inhibitory trials). To assess the stability of HR changes to DS and SS we analyzed whether and how the experimental conditions (modality and position of signals, the ratio of numbers of excitatory to inhibitory trials in the session) influenced HR. HR changes to DS were different in pattern, stability and direction when compared to HR changes in response to SS. Reactions to DS, although accompanied mainly by conditioned bradycardia, were not consistent and depended on experimental conditions. However, the SS always evoked conditioned tachycardia. Anxiolitycs--benzodiazepines (diazepam and midazolam) and buspirone--influenced HR in nonconsistent manner. Anxiogenics--PTZ and FG7142 were without significant effects on HR. HR could not be trusted therefore as direct index of pharmacologically induced emotional states. The results are discussed in the context of possible biobehavioral meaning of HR changes in response to danger and safety and their reliability as fear/relief correlates.", 
    "120": "A randomized, prospective study was conducted on 69 patients comparing recovery after two different anaesthetic techniques for ambulatory colonoscopy. Thirty-five patients received an intravenous fentanyl (1 microg/kg), midazolam (0.05 to 0. 075 mg/kg) and propofol (10 to 20 mg boluses as required) combination. 34 patients received sevoflurane in 67% nitrous oxide. Drug administration was titrated to clinical signs. At baseline and 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the procedure patient performance on a comprehensive battery of psychomotor tests was recorded. Emergence times were noted. Depth of sedation was assessed at 5 minute intervals for 30 minutes after the end of the procedure. Emergence times were faster in the fentanyl/midazolam/propofol group by 2.2 minutes. A lower sedation score was detected at 20 minutes in the sevoflurane/nitrous oxide group. Psychomotor impairment was of a greater magnitude and more prolonged by 30 to 90 minutes in the fentanyl/midazolam/propofol group. It is concluded that a sevoflurane/nitrous oxide anaesthetic has a suitable recovery profile for ambulatory colonoscopy and results in faster recovery of cognitive function compared with a fentanyl, midazolam and propofol combination.", 
    "121": "Conventional as well as newer antipsychotics cause weight gain, and, in the regulation of body weight, both insulin and leptin are hormones involved.", 
    "122": "The aim of the present study was to compare these hormonal levels in patients on treatment with different antipsychotics.", 
    "123": "Nineteen patients receiving conventional antipsychotics, 14 patients receiving clozapine and 14 patients receiving olanzapine, were studied. Fasting blood samples for insulin, leptin, glucose, and drug serum concentrations were analyzed. In addition, body mass index (BMI) was calculated.", 
    "124": "The median insulin level was significantly higher in the patients receiving olanzapine than in those receiving conventional agents, whereas there was no significant difference in insulin between the clozapine and the other two groups. However, in the clozapine group, insulin levels were positively correlated to the drug serum concentration. BMI was elevated in about half of the patients, with no difference being found between the groups. The leptin level was significantly higher in the women than in the men in the conventional agent group, but not in the olanzapine or clozapine groups.", 
    "125": "The higher insulin level in the patients receiving olanzapine than in those receiving conventional antipsychotics, despite similar BMI, points to a probable influence of olanzapine on insulin secretion. The correlation between the insulin levels and the clozapine concentration indicates, in addition, an influence of clozapine on insulin secretion. The gender difference in leptin, i.e. females normally having higher leptin levels than males, was found in the conventional agent group, but not in the olanzapine or clozapine groups, suggesting that also leptin regulation is altered during olanzapine or clozapine treatments. Moreover, it was mainly due to an increase of leptin in the males that leptin levels were equalized between sexes in the olanzapine group. We conclude that the influence of olanzapine and clozapine on both insulin and leptin levels might be associated with their weight-gain-inducing ability, while other mechanisms may be involved in the weight gain caused by conventional antipsychotics.", 
    "126": "Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, may increase daytime sleepiness and impair psychomotor performance, which is hazardous for patients engaging in daily activities such as car driving. Given current prescription practice, information on the repeated dose effects is required. The 5-HT2A/2C antagonist ritanserin was originally developed as a safer alternative to the benzodiazepines, yet having limited clinical efficacy. 5HT2A/2C receptors have been implicated in regulating slow-wave sleep but little is known about their role in human performance.", 
    "127": "The present study investigated the subchronic effects of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic lorazepam and the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist ritanserin on actual driving performance, objective and subjective sleepiness, and nocturnal slow wave sleep.", 
    "128": "Eighteen healthy volunteers were treated twice daily for 7 days with ritanserin 5 mg, lorazepam 1.5 mg or placebo. Treatments were administered according to a double-blind, cross-over design. Tests were performed on day 7 of each treatment week. Sleep EEG was recorded during the preceding night.", 
    "129": "Lorazepam had a pronounced impairing effect on lateral position control and induced daytime sleepiness, while having no effect on other parameters. In contrast, ritanserin did not impair driving performance or affect objectively measured daytime sleepiness, while subjects reported to feel more alert during daytime. Moreover, consistent with its effects on 5-HT2 receptors, ritanserin increased the amount of nocturnal slow wave sleep. There were no relationships between changes in slow wave sleep and performance parameters.", 
    "130": "Lorazepam administered for 7 consecutive days may be hazardous for patients who engage in driving activities. Antagonism of 5-HT2A/2C receptors, as accomplished by ritanserin, increases slow wave sleep and is devoid of effects on objective sleepiness and driving behaviour. Whether this extends to other cognitive and psychomotor domains remains to be established.", 
    "131": "Patients treated with olanzapine may gain weight, especially in the first months of therapy. Amantadine (100-300 mg/day) was started in 12 patients having a mean weight gain of 7.3 kg during olanzapine treatment. The patients' weight stabilised and over 3-6 months they lost an average of 3.5 kg. No clinical deterioration occurred and no adverse effects were reported. These observations merit confirmation in randomised, controlled trials.", 
    "132": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) - a common sensorimotor disorder - and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are currently treated with substances of four classes: dopaminergic agents, which are considered the drugs of choice, benzodiazepines, opioids and anticonvulsants. As their effects on sleep variables differ considerably, the aim of the present placebo-controlled sleep laboratory study was to measure the acute effects of 1 mg clonazepam on objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality in ten RLS and 16 PLMD patients, utilizing polysomnography (PSG) and psychometry. Descriptive data analysis demonstrated at the confirmatory level concerning three target variables that - as compared with placebo - clonazepam significantly improved objective sleep efficiency and subjective sleep quality in both patient groups, but failed to reduce the index PLM/h of sleep. At the descriptive level, in PLMD clonazepam improved PLM during time in bed, REM and wakefulness and showed more significant changes in various sleep and awakening measures than in RLS patients, though there were no significant inter-group differences. In conclusion, in both PLMD and RLS clonazepam exhibited acute therapeutic efficacy regarding insomnia, which is quite different from the mode of action of dopamine agonists.",

    "134": "The synthetic-computational approach to the study of the binding site of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands related to 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195, 1) within their receptor (Cappelli et al. J. Med. Chem. 1997, 40, 2910-2921) has been extended. A series of carboxamide derivatives endowed with differently substituted planar aromatic or heteroaromatic systems was designed with the aim of getting further information on the topological requisites of the carbonyl and aromatic moieties for interaction with the PBR binding site. The synthesis of most of these compounds involves Weinreb amidation of the appropriate lactone as the key step. The most potent compound, among the newly synthesized ones, shows a nanomolar PBR affinity similar to that shown by 1 and the presence of a basic N-ethyl-N-benzylaminomethyl group in 3-position of the quinoline nucleus. Thus, it may be considered the first example of a new class of water soluble derivatives of 1. Several computational methods were used to furnish descriptors of the isolated ligands (indirect approaches) able to rationalize the variation in the binding affinity of the enlarged series of compounds. Sound QSAR models are obtained by size and shape descriptors (volume approach) which codify for the short-range contributions to ligand-receptor interactions. Molecular descriptors which explicitly account for the electrostatic contribution to the interaction (CoMFA, CoMSIA, and surface approaches) perform well, but they do not improve the quantitative models. Moreover, useful hints for the identification of the antagonist binding site in the three-dimensional modeling of the receptor (direct approach) were provided by the receptor hypothesis derived by the pharmacophoric approach. The ligand-receptor complexes obtained provided a detailed description of the modalities of the interaction and interesting suggestions for further experiments.", 
    "135": "In the course of structural explorations around a series of potent CCK2 receptor antagonists, it was noted that simple N-methylation of the indolic N-H in the parent molecule gave rise to behavior in vivo that was consistent with the compound acting as an agonist. Exploration in vitro confirmed this property, and it was shown that the agonist action could be blocked by the reference CCK2 receptor antagonist, L-365,260. Further examples of this type of modification were explored, and a common theme with regard to agonist behavior was uncovered. Some molecular modeling is also presented in an attempt to throw light on the nature of the ligand receptor interactions that may be giving rise to the differing properties of these, apparently, structurally similar molecules.", 
    "136": "We provide the first evidence that prolactin is a neuromodulator of behavioral and neuroendocrine stress coping in the rat. In virgin female and male rats, intracerebral infusion of ovine prolactin (oPRL) into the lateral cerebral ventricle (intracerebroventricular) exerted an anxiolytic effect on the elevated plus-maze in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 and 1.0 microg/5 microl; p < 0.01). In contrast, downregulation of the expression of the long form of brain prolactin receptors by chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) (osmotic minipump, 0.5 microg. 0.5 microl(-1). hr(-1); 5 d) increased anxiety-related behavior on the plus-maze compared with mixed bases-treated and vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.01), again demonstrating an anxiolytic effect of PRL acting at brain level. Furthermore, in jugular vein-catheterized female rats, the stress-induced increase of corticotropin secretion was decreased after chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of oPRL (osmotic minipump, 1.0 microg. 0.5 microl(-1). hr(-1); p < 0.05) and, in contrast, was further elevated by antisense targeting of the brain prolactin receptors (p < 0.01). This provides evidence for a receptor-mediated attenuation of the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by prolactin. The antisense ODN sequence was selected on the basis of secondary structure molecular modeling of the target mRNA to improve antisense ODN-mRNA hybridization. Receptor autoradiography confirmed the expected improvement in the efficacy of downregulation of prolactin receptor expression [empirically designed antisense, 30%; p > 0.05, not significant; adjustment of target position after mRNA modeling, 72%; p < 0.05). Taken together, prolactin acting at brain level has to be considered as a novel regulator of both emotionality and HPA axis reactivity.", 
    "137": "Concerns that high dose opioids and sedatives might shorten patient survival could contribute to insufficient symptom alleviation for terminally ill cancer patients. To examine the effects of opioids and sedatives prescribed in the final 48 hours on patient survival, a re-analysis of the prospectively collected data was performed on 209 hospice inpatients. Patient characteristics and clinical symptoms were prospectively recorded, and information about the use of opioids and sedatives in the last two days was collected by a chart review. Opioids were prescribed in 82% of the patients, with a median dose of 80 mg oral morphine equivalent (OME)/48 hours. Sixty percent received some sedative medications, mainly haloperidol (43% of total sample, 7.5 mg/48 hours), midazolam (23%, 23mg/48 hours), and hydroxyzine (15%, 50 mg/48 hours). There were no significant differences in survival between the patients who received different doses of opioids (<240, 240--599, and > or =600 mg OME/48 hours) and of benzodiazepines (0, 1--59, and > or =60 mg parental midazolam equivalent/48 hours). Also, the survival of patients with haloperidol, hydroxyzine, and other sedative medications did not differ from those without. Furthermore, an addition of use of opioids and sedatives in the final 48 hours into the multiple regression model for survival prediction achieved no significant increase in predictability. In conclusion, opioids and sedatives used for symptom control in the last days are not associated with patient survival. They are safe and useful medications to palliate severe distress in the terminal stage of cancer when administered with a low initial dosage and adequate titration.", 
    "138": "The present study used a radiotelemetric method to compare the muscle relaxant, hypothermic and locomotor depressant actions of the imidazopyridine zolpidem, with those of the benzodiazepines lorazepam and diazepam. Rats, n=7 per group, were divided into 3 dose-dependent treatment groups (highest, middle, and lowest). Each rat within a treatment group received a single dose of diazepam, lorazepam, zolpidem and vehicle. All three drugs induced dose-dependent decreases in body temperature, locomotor activity and electromyographic (EMG) activity. Administration of zolpidem (5 and 10 mg/kg) resulted in maximal decrements in locomotor activity that were comparable to those elicited by both diazepam (10 and 20 mg/kg) and lorazepam (12.5 and 25 mg/kg). Zolpidem (10 mg/kg) decreased EMG activity levels to approximately 45% of vehicle treated controls; a value similar to that induced by diazepam (2.5 mg/kg). These data suggest that the imidazopyridine zolpidem has a similar profile of acute effects in comparison to the benzodiazepines diazepam and lorazepam. However, the relative magnitude of the effects differed, with zolpidem producing less hypothermia and muscle relaxation than the two benzodiazepines.", 
    "139": "In the social interaction test of anxiety, microinjections of midazolam (2-8 microg) into the dorsal hippocampus or dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus significantly increased the time spent in active social interaction, without changing locomotor activity, thus indicating specific anxiolytic effects. However, tolerance developed to these effects in rats that had been pre-treated for 6 days with (-)-nicotine (0.1 mg/kg/day; subcutaneous). Thus, cross-tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of midazolam develops rapidly following a short period of treatment with a low dose of nicotine, which contrasts with the more slowly developing tolerance (about 3 weeks) that develops after benzodiazepine treatment. Following 6 days of nicotine treatment there was a significant reduction in [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding at 2 and 10 nM in the hippocampus, but no change in the midbrain. The decrease in benzodiazepine binding could explain tolerance to the effects of midazolam when administered to the dorsal hippocampus, but other mechanisms, such as indirect effects on the serotonergic (5-HT) system, might be involved in tolerance to the effects of dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus administration.", 
    "140": "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) inhibited the binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam (2 nM), [(3)H]muscimol (5 nM) and 4 nM [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [(35)S]TBPS in the rat cerebellum as well as cerebral cortex. DHEAS-induced inhibition of binding of these radioligands (62% to 100%) was more pronounced as compared to that in the case of DHEA (5% to 31%). DHEAS, unlike DHEA, inhibited [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding significantly to a lesser extent in the cerebellum of ethanol-dependent rats as compared to the control group (I(max):82+/-1vs.92+/-2%, p<0.005). However, DHEA, unlike DHEAS, inhibited [(35)S]TBPS binding to a greater extent in the ethanol-dependent rat cerebellum as compared to the control group (I(max):31+/-2vs.19+/-2%, p<0.005). Furthermore, DHEA was more potent in inhibiting [(35)S]TBPS binding in the cerebellum (IC(50):55+/-5 vs. 74+/-7 microM, p<0.05) and cerebral cortex (IC(50):26+/-4vs.64+/-9 microM, p<0.05) of ethanol-dependent rats as compared to the control group. These observations indicate that unsulfated and sulfated androstane-steroids modulate the GABA(A) receptors in the control as well as the ethanol-dependent rats differentially, and also suggest that the androstane-steroid binding sites associated with the GABA(A) receptors play an important role during ethanol dependence.", 
    "141": "Intracerebroventricular injection of neuropeptide Y (NPY) produces potent 'anxiolytic' effects in animal models of anxiety. Administration of opioid receptor antagonists suppresses NPY-induced food intake and thermogenesis. The present study examined whether the opiate antagonist naloxone would also suppress the 'anxiolytic' effects of neuropeptide Y. Following training and stabilization of responding in an operant conflict model of anxiety, rats were injected with either NPY or diazepam. Both NPY (veh., 2, 4, 6 microg, i.c.v.) and chlordiazepoxide (veh., 2, 4, 6 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent increase in punished responding in the conflict test. The 'anxiolytic' effects of NPY were not blocked by the administration of flumazenil (3, 6, 12 mg/kg, i.p.). The administration of naloxone (0.25-2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) antagonized the effects of NPY. Central administration of the selective mu opiate antagonist CTAP (1 microg, i.c.v.) partially blocked NPY-induced conflict responding. These results support the hypothesis that NPY may play an important role in experimental anxiety independent of the benzodiazepine receptor and further implicate the opioid system in the behavioral expression of anxiety.", 
    "142": "Visually evoked behaviors mediated by the frog optic tectum require cholinergic activity, but the receptor subtypes through which acetylcholine acts are not yet identified. Using quantitative autoradiography and scintillation spectrometry, we examined the binding of [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]AF-DX 384 in the laminated optic tectum of the frog. In mammalian systems, these substances bind excitatory (m1 and m3 subtypes) and inhibitory (m2 and m4 subtypes) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively. Pharmacological analyses, including the use of specific muscarinic toxins, confirmed the subtype selectivity of the radioligands in the frog brain. Binding sites for [3H]pirenzepine were distinct from those for [3H]AF-DX 384. In the adult tectum, [3H]pirenzepine demonstrated specific binding in tectal layers 5-9. [3H]Pirenzepine binding was also present in tadpoles as young as stage V, but all sampled stages of tadpole tectum had significantly less binding when compared to adults. Lesioning of the optic nerve had no effect on [3H]pirenzepine binding. Specific [3H]AF-DX 384 binding was found in all layers of the adult tectum. All sampled tadpole stages exhibited binding sites for [3H]AF-DX 384, but the densities of these sites were also significantly higher in adults than they were in developing stages. Short-term lesions of the optic nerve reduced [3H]AF-DX 384 binding in all tectal layers of the deafferented lobe when compared to the afferented one. Long-term lesions decreased [3H]AF-DX 384 sites in both lobes.These results indicate that multiple muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding sites reside in the frog optic tectum at all stages of development, and their pharmacology resembles that of mammalian m1/m3, m2 and m4 subtypes. Our data indicate that few, if any, of these receptors are likely to be located on retinal ganglion cell terminals. Furthermore, the expression of inhibitory muscarinic subtypes seems to be regulated by different mechanisms than that for excitatory subtypes.", 
    "143": "Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded under Whole-cell voltage clamp from carp type 1 horizontal cells (H1 cells) uncoupled by dopamine in retinal slices. Red light steps, which hyperpolarise cones and reduce glutamate release, induced outward current responses accompanied by a suppression of sEPSCs. sEPSCs decayed exponentially with a mean time constant of 0.71+/-0.07 ms and had a reversal potential near 0 mV. Power spectral analysis of sEPSCs revealed a similar decay time constant. They were suppressed by a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, CNQX at 10 microM, and a relatively specific AMPA receptor antagonist, GYKI52466 at 20 microM. The presence of sEPSCs suggests that the release of glutamate from cone synaptic terminals is vesicular. The reduction in mean sEPSC frequency with red light was not accompanied by a significant change in the mean sEPSC conductance increase (482+/-59 pS), suggesting that a decrease in the vesicular release rate from cones does not alter the vesicular glutamate concentration (quantal contents). The results suggest that the spontaneous events in H1 cells were contributed by non-NMDA (possibly AMPA) type glutamate receptors modulated by the red cone input.", 
    "144": "Flexible sigmoidoscopy remains a common tool used for the periodic screening of colorectal cancer. Most organizations recommend screening at three- to five-year intervals beginning at age 50 for persons with average risk. Extensive training in endoscopic maneuvering, colorectal anatomy and pathologic recognition is required. Most physicians report comfort performing the procedure unsupervised after 10 to 25 precepted sessions. The procedure involves the insertion of the sigmoidoscope through the anus and distal rectum and advancement of the scope tip to an average depth of 48 to 55 cm in the sigmoid colon. Once the sigmoidoscope has been appropriately advanced, the scope is slowly withdrawn, allowing for the inspection of colon mucosa during withdrawal. Polyps less than 5 mm in diameter should be biopsied. Polyps 5 to 10 mm or greater can be assumed to be adenomatous, and follow-up colonoscopy for complete polypectomy is required. Diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, nonspecific colitis and pseudomembranes may also be encountered during inspection.

After discharge both midazolam groups had an unsteady gait (75%) and there was no significant difference in the duration. As expected because of the deliberate selection of combative children into the ketamine group, the pre-sedation behaviour was slightly more disturbed compared with the midazolam group (p=0.10).

Recently, we started to evaluate cardiac parameters in medicated patients with schizophrenia using power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability. We present a case of a patient with long-standing schizophrenia who was treated with clozapine. His electrocardiogram revealed minor abnormalities, including a prolonged QT interval. Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability demonstrated marked abnormalities in autonomic nervous system activity. Two years later, his treatment was switched to olanzapine. We reevaluated his cardiac parameters. Power spectrum analysis studies revealed that heart rate had significantly improved and that power spectrum cardiovascular parameters had returned to normal. Serial electrocardiograms revealed a minimally and asymptomatically prolonged QT interval. This case demonstrates the importance of screening electrocardiograms, even in healthy young patients. It also emphasizes how minor changes in electrocardiogram can be overlooked on standard electrocardiograms. Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability is useful in this instance because it magnifies the trace and detects even minor disturbances. Care should be taken in prescribing antipsychotic drugs to patients who are prone to cardiovascular side effects, and alternatives to antipsychotics with prominent anticholinergic profile, in particular, should be sought.", 
    "176": "This study describes for the first time the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of the psychomotor and amnesic effects of a single 2-mg oral dose of lorazepam in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers were included in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled two-way crossover study. The effect of lorazepam was examined for a battery of tests that explored mood, vigilance, psychomotor performance, and memory. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of these tests was performed using the indirect response model. Vigilance and psychomotor performance were significantly impaired. Short-term memory was not affected, but a paradoxical tendency to improvement of the score was observed 0.4 hours after drug intake. Significant impairment was observed for immediate and delayed cued verbal recall, for immediate and delayed free recall, and for picture recognition as well as for visual-verbal recall, but not for cued visual-spatial recall or priming. Globally, the different effects were greatest between 0.4 to 3 hours after dosing. However, the time course profile of the recovery period suggests a possible dissociation between the kinetics of the effects of lorazepam on vigilance, psychomotor performance, and visual episodic memory, on the one hand, and on verbal episodic memory, on the other. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model used two compartments with first-order absorption to describe the lorazepam concentrations and an indirect response model with inhibition or stimulation of Kin to describe the effects. The mean values for calculated median effective concentration (EC50) derived from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of the different tests ranged from 11.3 to 39.8 ng/mL. According to these EC50 values, lorazepam seemed to be more potent on the delayed-recall trials than on the immediate-recall trials; similar observations were made concerning the free-recall versus cued-recall trials. The previously stated results suggest that the tests performed in this study represent sensitive measurements of the effects of lorazepam on the central nervous system. Moreover, the parameter values derived from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, especially, the EC50 values, may provide sensitive indices that can be used to compare the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepines.",

The influence of different alpha subunits in combination with beta3gamma2s was examined in stably expressed human recombinant GABA(A) receptors by measuring (36)Cl influx through the ion channel pore. Muscimol and GABA exhibited similar maximal efficacy at each receptor subtype, although muscimol was more potent, with responses blocked by picrotoxin and bicuculline. Receptors containing the alpha3 subunit exhibited slightly lower potency. The comparative pharmacology of a range of benzodiazepine site ligands was examined, revealing a range of intrinsic efficacies at different receptor subtypes. Of the diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptors (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5), alpha5 showed the most divergence, being discriminated by zolpidem in terms of very low affinity, and CL218,872 and CGS9895 with different efficacies. Benzodiazepine potentiation at alpha3beta3gamma2s with nonselective agonist chlordiazepoxide was greater than at alpha1, alpha2, or alpha5 (P < 0.001). The presence of an alpha4 subunit conferred a unique pharmacological profile. The partial agonist bretazenil was the most efficacious benzodiazepine, despite lower alpha4 affinity, and FG8205 displayed similar efficacy. Most striking were the lack of affinity/efficacy for classical benzodiazepines and the relatively high efficacy of Ro15-1788 (53 +/- 12%), CGS8216 (56 +/- 6%), CGS9895 (65 +/- 6%), and the weak partial inverse agonist Ro15-4513 (87 +/- 5%).
