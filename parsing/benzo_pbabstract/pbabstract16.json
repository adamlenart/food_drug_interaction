Mice were fed a diet containing 3% GP for 4weeks, and the CYP expression levels and activity were determined. The GP-treated group showed a significant decrease in the hepatic CYP3A and an increase in the hepatic CYP2C expression compared with the control group. CYP1A, CYP2D, and CYP2E expression were not different between the GP-treated and the control groups. In the small intestine, there were no differences in the CYP3A protein levels between the groups. The increase in the plasma triazolam concentration in the GP-treated group was observed. Although no changes were found in the hepatic CYP3A levels in mice receiving a diet containing 0.1% GP for 4weeks, a significant decrease was seen in the hepatic CYP3A level in mice receiving a diet containing 3% GP for only 1week. This study revealed that the intake of a high-dose GP results in a liver-specific decrease in the CYP3A expression level. The results also indicated that the effects of GP on CYP3A were not observed following the intake of a low-dose GP.

Patients managed with ECMO were younger, had a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and, in the 24 hours prior to the period of maximum sedative exposure, had a higher ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fraction of inspired oxygen and were more likely to receive renal replacement and high-dose fentanyl (2000 \u03bcg or more/24 hrs) therapy. An adjusted multivariable linear regression model using the natural logarithmic value of the maximum sedative exposure in a 6-hour period revealed that patient age (p=0.04) and administration of high-dose fentanyl in the 24 hours prior to the 6-hour period of maximum sedative use (p<0.0001) were each independently associated with the maximum 6-hour sedative requirement reached, but the use of ECMO was not (p=0.52).",

On day 3, she developed tachypnea and arterial blood gas analysis revealed a severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.2, PCO2 19\u200amm Hg, bicarbonates 8\u200amEq/L) with anion gap of 25\u200amEq/L and lactate of 12.1\u200ammol/L. TMP/SMX was discontinued and the lactate decreased to 2.9\u200ammol/L within 24\u200ahours while her plasma bicarbonates normalized, without additional intervention. The patient never developed hypotension or severe hypoxia, and her renal and liver functions were normal. No other cause for lactic acidosis was identified and it resolved after TMP/SMX cessation alone, suggesting PG toxicity.Although PG-related lactic acidosis is well recognized after large doses of lorazepam, clinicians should bear in mind that TMP/SMX contains PG as well and should suspect PG toxicity in patients developing unexplained metabolic acidosis while receiving TMP/SMX.", 
    "53": "This study aims at developing a simulation system that predicts the optimal study design for attaining tracer steady-state conditions in brain and blood rapidly. Tracer kinetics was determined from bolus studies and used to construct the system. Subsequently, the system was used to design inputs for bolus infusion (BI) or programmed infusion (PI) experiments. Steady-state quantitative measurements can be made with one short scan and venous blood samples. The GABAA receptor ligand [(11)C]Flumazenil (FMZ) was chosen for this purpose, as it lacks a suitable reference region. Methods. Five bolus [(11)C]FMZ-PET scans were conducted, based on which population-based PI and BI schemes were designed and tested in five additional healthy subjects. The design of a PI was assisted by an offline feedback controller. Results. The system could reproduce the measurements in blood and brain. With PI, [(11)C]FMZ steady state was attained within 40\u2009min, which was 8\u2009min earlier than the optimal BI (B/I ratio = 55\u2009min). Conclusions. The system can design both BI and PI schemes to attain steady state rapidly. For example, subjects can be [(11)C]FMZ-PET scanned after 40\u2009min of tracer infusion for 40\u2009min with venous sampling and a straight-forward quantification. This simulation toolbox is available for other PET-tracers.",

The annual drug-related fatalities increased by 57% from 2001 to 2013 (total n = 100,882); 51.8% were accidental, 7.9% homicide, 18.6% natural, and 19.6% suicide. The different manners of death exhibited distinct demographic profiles and drug composition. The gender gap was more prominent in homicide. Age \u226555 years was more closely associated with natural death and suicide. Age <35 years and central nervous system (CNS) stimulants including amphetamines and cocaine showed higher relative risks for accidental death and homicide, whereas CNS depressants including benzodiazepines, carisoprodol, opioids, and zolpidem were more strongly associated with accidental death and/or suicide. The findings aid in identifying populations more vulnerable to drug-related deaths, developing targeted interventions and thereby improving efficiency of preventive efforts.",

As a consequence, identification of novel anticonvulsant agents is an important issue in medicinal chemistry. In the present article we report synthesis, physicochemical, and pharmacological evaluation of N-trans-cinnamoyl derivatives of R and S-2-aminopropan-1-ol, as well as R and S-2-aminobutan-1-ol. The structures were confirmed by spectroscopy and for derivatives of 2-aminopropan-1-ols the configuration was evaluated by means of crystallography. The investigated compounds were tested in rodent models of seizures: maximal electroshock (MES) and subcutaneous pentetrazol test (scPTZ), and also in a rodent model of epileptogenesis: pilocarpine-induced status prevention. Additionally, derivatives of 2-aminopropan-1-ols were tested in benzodiazepine-resistant electrographic status epilepticus rat model as well as in vitro for inhibition of isoenzymes of cytochrome P450. All of the tested compounds showed promising anticonvulsant activity in MES. For R(-)-(2E)-N-(1-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-enamide pharmacological parameters were found as follows: ED50 \u2009=\u200976.7 (68.2-81.3) mg/kg (MES, mice i.p., time\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009h), ED50 \u2009=\u2009127.2 (102.1-157.9) mg/kg (scPTZ, mice i.p., time\u2009=\u20090.25\u2009h), TD50 \u2009=\u2009208.3 (151.4-230.6) mg/kg (rotarod, mice i.p., time\u2009=\u20090.25\u2009h). Evaluation in pilocarpine status prevention proved that all of the reported compounds reduced spontaneous seizure activity and act as antiepileptogenic agents. Both enantiomers of 2-aminopropan-1-ols did not influence cytochrome P450 isoenzymes activity in vitro and are likely not to interact with CYP substrates in vivo.

Although catatonia is often associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression, in about 20 to 39% of the patients a somatic illness is found. Unfortunately, this diagnosis is often missed although catatonia is characterized by a specific symptom complex. We report a case of acute catatonia with psychotic features in a patient with multiple myeloma (MM), caused by systemic use of dexamethasone. Physicians should be aware of possible psychiatric side effects when prescribing high doses of dexamethasone. Further, MM patients on corticosteroids should be closely monitored for mild psychological and/or psychiatric symptoms since they may be predictive for the onset of catatonia.",

Using the data obtained from quantum chemical calculations at PM3/HF level, the electron conformational matrices of congruity (ECMC) were constructed by EMRE software. The ECMC of the lowest energy conformer of the compound with the highest activity was chosen as the template and compared with the ECMCs of the lowest energy conformer of the other compounds within given tolerances to reveal the electron conformational submatrix of activity (ECSA, i.e. pharmacophore) by ECSP software. A descriptor pool was generated taking into account the obtained pharmacophore. To predict the theoretical activity and select the best subset of variables affecting bioactivities, the nonlinear least square regression method and genetic algorithm were performed. For four types of activity including the GI50, TGI, LC50 and IC50 of the pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepine series, the r(2)train, r(2)test and q(2) values were 0.858, 0.810, 0.771; 0.853, 0.848, 0.787; 0.703, 0.787, 0.600; and 0.776, 0.722, 0.687, respectively.",

Status epilepticus is divided into four stages: early, established, refractory, and super-refractory. While initial treatment with benzodiazepines has become standard of care for early status epilepticus, treatment after benzodiazepine failure (established status epilepticus (ESE)) is incompletely studied. Effective treatment of ESE is critical as morbidity and mortality increases dramatically the longer convulsive status epilepticus persists. Phenytoin/fosphenytoin, valproic acid, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, and lacosamide are the most frequently prescribed antiseizure medications for treatment of ESE. To date there are no class 1 data to support pharmacologic recommendations of one agent over another. We review each of these medications, their pharmacology, the scientific evidence in support and against each in the available literature, adverse effects and safety profiles, dosing recommendations, and limitations of the available evidence. We also discuss future directions including the established status epilepticus treatment trial (ESETT). Substantial further research is urgently needed to identify these patients (particularly those with non-convulsive status epilepticus), elucidate the most efficacious antiseizure treatment with head-to-head randomized prospective trials, and determine whether this differs for convulsive vs. non-convulsive ESE.",

Therefore, patients prefer to be sedated when undergoing examination, although the best combination of drugs has not been determined. The combination of opioids and benzodiazepines is used to relieve the patient's pain and discomfort. More recently, propofol has assumed a prominent position. This randomized prospective study is unique in medical literature that specifically compared the use of propofol and fentanyl with or without midazolam for colonoscopy sedation performed by anesthesiologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the side effects of sedation, discharge conditions, quality of sedation, and propofol consumption during colonoscopy, with or without midazolam as preanesthetic. The study involved 140 patients who underwent colonoscopy at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I received intravenous midazolam as preanesthetic 5min before sedation, followed by fentanyl and propofol; Group II received intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol. Patients in Group II had a higher incidence of reaction (motor or verbal) to the colonoscope introduction, bradycardia, hypotension, and increased propofol consumption. Patient satisfaction was higher in Group I. According to the methodology used, the combination of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol for colonoscopy sedation reduces propofol consumption and provides greater patient satisfaction.",

This study's purpose was to report neonatal nurses' knowledge, existing pain assessment practice, and pharmacological pain management of neonates in Jordan. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Eighteen neonatal intensive care units in Jordan were included in the study. One hundred eighty-four neonatal nurses participated. Questionnaires were distributed by and returned to the neonatal intensive care units' managers between June and August 2014. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present study results. Of 240 questionnaires distributed, 184 useable responses were returned. Nurses' knowledge regarding neonates' neurological development, nociception, and need for neonatal pain management was suboptimal. The analgesics most commonly used to treat neonatal pain were acetaminophen (52%) and lidocaine (45%). Benzodiazepines, phenobarbitone, and muscles relaxants were also used. Most nurses (54%-97%) reported that pain emanating from most painful procedures was never or rarely treated. Circumcision, lumbar punctures, and chest tube insertion were assigned the highest pain scores (\u22659), but were rarely accompanied by analgesia. Pain assessment scales were more likely to be used, and procedural pain was more likely to be treated, in private hospitals than public hospitals. Neonates who require special care still suffer unnecessary pain that could be avoided and managed by following best practice recommendations. Disparities between developed and developing countries in quality of neonatal pain care appear to exist. Resources for education and routine care are needed to address these discrepancies.", 
    "117": "Benzodiazepines are frequently long-term prescribed for the treatment of patients with severe mental illness. This prescribing practice is problematic because of well-described side effects including risk of dependence. We examined the efficacy of prolonged-release melatonin on objective and subjective sleep quality during benzodiazepine discontinuation and whether sleep variables were associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Eligible patients included adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder and long-term use of benzodiazepines in combination with antipsychotics. All participants gradually tapered the use of benzodiazepines after randomization to add-on treatment with melatonin versus placebo. Here we report a subsample of 23 patients undergoing sleep recordings (one-night polysomnography) and 55 patients participating in subjective sleep quality ratings. Melatonin had no effect on objective sleep efficiency, but significantly improved self-reported sleep quality. Reduced benzodiazepine dosage at the 24-week follow-up was associated with a significantly decreased proportion of stage 2 sleep. These results indicate that prolonged-release melatonin has some efficacy for self-reported sleep quality after gradual benzodiazepine dose reduction, and that benzodiazepine discontinuation is not associated with rebound insomnia in medicated patients with severe mental illness. However, these findings were limited by a small sample size and a low retention rate.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the interrelationship between sleep disorders in ESRD patients and their characteristics. Through a cross-sectional study (2010-2011), 88 ESRD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis thrice weekly were recruited to enter the study. We used a self-administered questionnaire into which the data were reflected. The patients selected their specific sleep disorders using a nine-item scale while the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) determined both the presence and severity of sleep disorders. The data was finally analyzed with their baseline characteristics, dialysis characteristics, medication/stimulants use, and clinical and biochemical parameters. Over 95% of the patients had, at least, one specific sleep disorder while the ESS revealed 36.36% of patients as normal, 59.09% as having mild sleep disorders, and 4.54% as having moderate to severe sleep disorders. Sleep disorders were significantly correlated with older ages (P=0.035), dialysis dose (P=0.001), blood creatinine levels (P=0.037), upper airways obstruction (P=0.035), hepatomegaly (P=0.006), hepatic failure (P=0.001), higher blood TSH levels (P=0.039), history of hypothyroidism (P=0.005), and the use of levodopa (P=0.004), anti-hypertensive medications (P=0.006), benzodiazepines (P=0.006), Eprex (Erythropoietin) (P=0.001), Venofer (Iron Sucrose Injection) (P=0.013), and phosphate-binders agents (P=0.018).

    "119": "Bromodomain-containing proteins are vital for controlling the expression of many pro-inflammatory genes. Consequently, compounds capable of inhibiting specific bromodomain-facilitated protein-protein interactions would be predicted to alleviate inflammation, making them valuable agents in the treatment of diseases caused by dysregulated inflammation, such as age-related macular degeneration. Here, we assessed the ability of known inhibitors JQ-1, PFI-1, and IBET-151 to protect from the inflammation and cell death caused by etoposide exposure in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line, ARPE-19. The potential anti-inflammatory effects of the bromodomain inhibitors were assessed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) profiling. The involvement of NF-\u03baB and SIRT1 in inflammatory signaling was monitored by ELISA and western blotting. Furthermore, SIRT1 was knocked down using a specific siRNA or inhibited by EX-527 to elucidate its role in the inflammatory reaction. The bromodomain inhibitors effectively decreased etoposide-induced release of IL-6 and IL-8. This anti-inflammatory effect was not related to SIRT1 activity, although all bromodomain inhibitors decreased the extent of acetylation of p53 at the SIRT1 deacetylation site. Overall, since bromodomain inhibitors display anti-inflammatory properties in human retinal pigment epithelial cells, these compounds may represent a new way of alleviating the inflammation underlying the onset of age-related macular degeneration.",

We developed and validated an LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous identification of multiple abused drugs, benzodiazepines, and new psychoactive substances in urine from suspected drug abusers. The instrument was operated in multiple-reaction monitoring using an electrospray ionization mode. Chromatograms were separated using an ACE5 C18 column on a gradient of acetonitrile. After liquid-liquid extraction, samples were passed through a 0.22-\u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride filter before injection into the LC-MS/MS. The limits of quantitation ranged from 0.5\u00a0ng/mL to 31.3\u00a0ng/mL. The linearity ranged from 0.5\u00a0ng/mL to 200\u00a0ng/mL.

Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation as a part of the innate immune system, has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TSPO ligands, especially Ro5-4864, potently suppressed ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP-1 and BMDM cells. Detailed action mechanism was further investigated in THP-1\u00a0cells. Ro5-4864 efficiently attenuated NLRP3 translocation to mitochondria, inflammasome assembly/oligomerization, activation of caspase-1, and subsequent secretion of the mature forms of interleukin-1\u03b2 and\u00a0-18. Ro5-4864 also reduced the production of mitochondrial superoxide and preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential in ATP-treated cells, suggesting that Ro5-4864 may act on mitochondria or more upstream targets in NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. We also observed the distinct effects of the TSPO ligands between THP-1 monocytes and macrophages, which suggested different NLRP3 inflammasome signaling depending on cell type. Collectively, our novel findings demonstrate that Ro5-4864 effectively inhibited ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the prevention of mitochondrial perturbation. Our results indicate Ro5-4864 as a promising candidate for the treatment of NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.", 
    "140": "The superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels includes neurotransmitter receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission in vertebrates, and are targets for drugs including alcohols, anesthetics, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants. However, the mechanisms of ion channel opening, gating, and modulation in these receptors leave many open questions, despite their pharmacological importance. Subtle conformational changes in both the extracellular and transmembrane domains are likely to influence channel opening, but have been difficult to characterize given the limited structural data available for human membrane proteins. Recent crystal structures of a modified Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in multiple states offer an appealing model system for structure-function studies. However, the pharmacology of the crystallographic GluCl construct is not well established. To establish the functional relevance of this system, we used two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes to characterize activation of crystallographic and native-like GluCl constructs by L-glutamate and ivermectin. We also tested modulation by ethanol and other anesthetic agents, and used site-directed mutagenesis to explore the role of a region of Loop F which was implicated in ligand gating by molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings indicate that the crystallographic construct functionally models concentration-dependent agonism and allosteric modulation of pharmacologically relevant receptors. Specific substitutions at residue Leu174 in loop F altered direct L-glutamate activation, consistent with computational evidence for this region's role in ligand binding. These insights demonstrate conservation of activation and modulation properties in this receptor family, and establish a framework for GluCl as a model system, including new possibilities for drug discovery. In this study, we elucidate the validity of a modified glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluClcryst ) as a structurally accessible model for GABAA receptors. In contrast to native-like controls, GluClcryst exhibits classical activation by its neurotransmitter ligand L-glutamate. The modified channel is also sensitive to allosteric modulators associated with human GABAA receptors, and to site-directed mutations predicted to alter channel opening.",

Results: The symptom-triggered group showed less need of pharmacological treatment duration (p<0.001) and cumulative dosage of medication compared to the fixed-schedule protocol (p<0.006). No difference was observed regarding the need of clonidine or haloperidol (to treat blood pressure derailment or delirium) and the incidence of epileptic seizures.

    "152": "Recent heuristic models of schizophrenia propose that abnormalities in the gamma frequency cerebral oscillations may be closely tied to the pathophysiology of the disorder, with hypofunction of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAr) implicated as having a crucial role. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a behavioural measure of sensorimotor gating that is disrupted in schizophrenia. We tested the ability for antipsychotic drugs with diverse pharmacological actions to (1) ameliorate NMDAr antagonist-induced disruptions to gamma oscillations and (2) attenuate NMDAr antagonist-induced disruptions to PPI. We hypothesized that antipsychotic-mediated improvement of PPI deficits would be accompanied by a normalization of gamma oscillatory activity. Wistar rats were implanted with extradural electrodes to facilitate recording of electroencephalogram during PPI behavioural testing. In each session, the rats were administered haloperidol (0.25 mg kg(-1)), clozapine (5 mg kg(-1)), olanzapine (5 mg kg(-1)), LY379268 (3 mg kg(-1)), NFPS (sarcosine, 1 mg kg(-1)), d-serine (1800 mg kg(-1)) or vehicle, followed by the NMDAr antagonists MK-801(0.16 mg kg(-1)), ketamine (5 mg kg(-1)) or vehicle. Outcome measures were auditory-evoked, as well as ongoing, gamma oscillations and PPI. Although treatment with all the clinically validated antipsychotic drugs reduced ongoing gamma oscillations, clozapine was the only compound that prevented the sensory-evoked gamma deficit produced by ketamine and MK-801. In addition, clozapine was also the only antipsychotic that attenuated the disruption to PPI produced by the NMDAr antagonists. We conclude that disruptions to evoked, but not ongoing, gamma oscillations caused by NMDAr antagonists are functionally relevant, and suggest that compounds, which restore sensory-evoked gamma oscillations may improve sensory processing in patients with schizophrenia.",

This case report also discusses theories regarding the pathophysiology of paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, known risk factors, and appropriate treatment.", 
    "154": "Diazepam is highly sorbed to the plastic materials of administration sets for intravenous infusion. This can be detrimental as it should be delivered to the patient at the administered amount for efficacy and safety. We report here the sorption levels of diazepam onto various types of tubes in administration sets. The tube materials of the administration sets included polyvinylchloride (PVC) and the non-PVC materials such as polyurethane (PU) and polyolefin (PO) were used. Two conditions of diazepam administered in preclinical and clinical settings were tested using an infusion pump. Injections were prepared by diluting diazepam to 20mg/500mL and 10mg/100mL in 5% dextrose. Diluted diazepam solutions at the concentrations of 10mg/100mL and 20mg/500mL were separately delivered through 1m of tubing at 1mL/min for 1.05 and 4.05h. Samples were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. PVC- and PU-based tubes showed higher sorption of diazepam than did PO-based tubes. PO-based tubes delivered more than 90% of the administered diazepam. The results showed that PO-based tubes of administration sets have a promising potential to deliver hydrophobic drugs like diazepam with minimal sorption levels. In addition, the tube materials in administration sets may be one of the critical factors to ensure drug efficacy and safety.",

A single fatality involving MT-45 and etizolam is described. A method for the quantitation of MT-45 in whole blood using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated. The linear range was determined to be 1.0-100 ng/mL with a detection limit of 1.0 ng/mL, and the method met the requirements for acceptable linearity, precision and accuracy. After analyzing the sample on dilution and by standard addition, the concentration of MT-45 in the decedent's blood was determined to be 520 ng/mL, consistent with other concentrations of MT-45 reported in drug-related fatalities. Etizolam was present at a concentration of 35 ng/mL. This case illustrates the importance of considering non-traditional drugs in unexplained apparent drug-related deaths.", 
    "156": "Despite their high prevalence, little is known about the effects of substance use disorders and active substance use on the suicide risk or length-of-stay of psychiatric inpatients. This study examines the relationship between active substance use at the time of psychiatric hospitalization and changes in suicide risk measures and length-of-stay. Admission and discharge ratings on the Suicide Status Form-II-R, diagnoses, and toxicology data from 2,333 unique psychiatric inpatients were examined. Data for patients using alcohol, tetrahydrocannabinol, methamphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, phencyclidine, and multiple substances on admission were compared with data from 1,426 admissions without substance use. Patients with substance use by toxicology on admission had a 0.9\u00a0day shorter length-of-stay compared to toxicology-negative patients. During initial nurse evaluation on the inpatient unit, these patients reported lower suicide measures (i.e., suicidal ideation frequency, overall suicide risk, and wish-to-die). No significant between-group differences were seen at discharge. Patients admitted with a substance use disorder diagnosis had a 1.0\u00a0day shorter length-of-stay than those without, while those with a substance use disorder diagnosis and positive toxicology reported the lowest measures of suicidality on admission. These results remained independent of psychiatric diagnosis. For acute psychiatric inpatients, suicide risk is higher and length-of-stay is longer in patients with substance use disorders who are NOT acutely intoxicated compared with patients without a substance use disorder. Toxicology-positive patients are less suicidal on admission and improve faster than their toxicology-negative counterparts. This study gives support to the clinical observation that acutely intoxicated patients may stabilize quickly with regard to suicidal urges and need for inpatient care.",

However, data for structurally diverse compounds to this (prototype) sampler coating are too limited to define its structural limitations. We determined C18/SCX fiber partitioning coefficients of nineteen cationic structures without hydrogen bonding capacity besides the charged group, stretching over a wide hydrophobicity range (including amphetamine, amitriptyline, promazine, chlorpromazine, triflupromazine, difenzoquat), and eight basic pharmaceutical and illicit drugs (pKa>8.86) with additional hydrogen bonding moieties (MDMA, atenolol, alprenolol, metoprolol, morphine, nicotine, tramadol, verapamil). In addition, sorption data for three neutral benzodiazepines (diazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam) and the anionic NSAID diclofenac were collected to determine the efficiency to sample non-basic drugs. All tested compounds showed nonlinear isotherms above 1mmol/L coating, and linear isotherms below 1mmol/L. The affinity for C18/SCX-SPME for tested organic cations without Hbond capacities increased with longer alkyl chains, ranging from logarithmic fiber-water distribution coefficients (log Dfw) of 1.8 (benzylamine) to 5.8 (triflupromazine). Amines smaller than benzylamine may thus have limited detection levels, while cationic surfactants with alkyl chain lengths >12 carbon atoms may sorb too strong to the C18/SCX sampler which hampers calibration of the fiber-water relationship in the linear range. The log Dfw for these simple cation structures closely correlates with the octanol-water partition coefficient of the neutral form (Kow,N), and decreases with increased branching and presence of multiple aromatic rings. Oxygen moieties in organic cations decreased the affinity for C18/SCX-SPME. Log Dfw values of neutral benzodiazepines were an order of magnitude higher than their log Kow,N. Results for anionic diclofenac species (logKow,N 4.5, pKa 4.0, log Dfw 2.9) indicate that the C18-SCX fiber might also be useful for sampling of organic anions. This data supports our theory that C18-based coatings are able to sorb ionized compounds through adsorption and demonstrates the applicability of C18-based SPME in the measurement of freely dissolved concentrations of a wide range of ionizable compounds.", 
    "166": "Chlorpromazine is known to cause ocular pigmentary deposits. However, delayed presentation after cessation of chlorpromazine has not been reported. There are also no reports on whether newer generation of anti-psychotic agents contribute to ocular toxicity. We describe a case of ocular toxicity related to anti-psychotic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of anterior segment pigmentary deposits associated with olanzapine use, 2 years after the cessation of chlorpromazine. We report a case of ocular toxicity in a patient with history of chlorpromazine usage of 100\u200amg per day for 13 years and subsequently switched to olanzapine 5\u200amg for 2 years. There were no signs of ocular toxicity while the patient was on chlorpromazine. However, when the patient switched to olanzapine, she developed the ocular side effect as described for chlorpromazine-induced ocular toxicity, with pigmentary depositions on both corneas and the anterior lens surface and decrease in vision. Olanzapine, a newer anti-psychotic agent, may play a role in the ocular pigmentary deposition, either directly causing pigmentary deposition itself or accentuating the effect of chlorpromazine as the 2 drugs act on the same receptors, although further studies are required to support this hypothesis. As patients with psychiatric conditions may not voluntarily complain of visual symptoms, ocular screening could be considered in these patients receiving chronic anti-psychotic treatment, so that any ocular toxicity could be diagnosed in a timely manner.",

    "170": "The substantia gelatinosa (SG) of the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) receives nociceptive afferent inputs from thin-myelinated A[Formula: see text] fibers and unmyelinated C fibers and has been shown to be involved in the processing of orofacial nociceptive information. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang-Qin, SbG), one of the 50 fundamental herbs of Chinese herbology, has been used historically as anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic medicine. Baicalin, one of the major compounds of SbG, has been reported to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, the receptor type activated by baicalin and its precise action mechanism on the SG neurons of Vc have not yet been studied. The whole-cell patch clamp technique was performed to examine the ion channels activated by baicalin on the SG neurons of Vc. In high Cl[Formula: see text] pipette solution, the baicalin (300[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M) induced repeatable inward currents ([Formula: see text][Formula: see text]pA, [Formula: see text]) without desensitization on all the SG neurons tested. Further, the inward currents showed a concentration (0.1-3[Formula: see text]mM) dependent pattern. The inward current was sustained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M), a voltage sensitive Na[Formula: see text] channel blocker. In addition, baicalin-induced inward currents were reduced in the presence of picrotoxin (50[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M), a GABAA receptor antagonist, flumazenil (100[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M), a benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptor antagonist, and strychnine (2[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M), a glycine receptor antagonist, respectively. These results indicate that baicalin has inhibitory effects on the SG neurons of the Vc, which are due to the activation of GABAA and/or the glycine receptor.

Whilst the theoretical risks of self-medication have been abundantly discussed in the literature (adverse effects, interactions, product, dosage or treatment duration errors, difficulty in self-diagnosis, risk of addiction or abuse\u2026), there is in fact very little detailed pharmacovigilance data concerning the characteristics and the consequences of this usage in real life.

The combination of benzodiazepines with substantial exposure to WD might set the stage for increased hippocampal vulnerability for benzodiazepines leading to exaggerated cognitive impairment in the postoperative period. In this study, Fischer 344 rats were fed either WD or standard rodent diet from 5 to 10.5 months of age. Rats were exposed to midazolam or placebo two days prior to an MRI scan using Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) to assess brain microstructural integrity, followed by behavioral testing using a water radial arm maze. Hippocampal tissue was collected to assess alterations in protein biochemistry in brain regions associated with learning and memory. Our results showed that rats exposed to the combination of midazolam and WD had significantly delayed time of learning and exhibited spatial memory impairment. Further, we observed an overall increase of kurtosis metrics in the hippocampus and increased expression of the mitochondrial protein VDAC2 in midazolam-treated rats. Our data suggest that both the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam and WD contribute to negatively affect the brain in middle-aged rats. This study is the first application of DKI on the effects of midazolam and WD exposure, and the findings demonstrate that diffusion metrics are sensitive indicators of changes in the complexity of neurite architecture.",

Herein we address these topics for the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a key molecular target for novel cognition enhancers, by using spatial intensity distribution analysis. This method can measure fluorescent particle concentration and assess oligomerization states of proteins within defined regions of living cells. Imaging and analysis of the basolateral surface of cells expressing some 50 molecules\u00b7\u03bcm(-2) human muscarinic M1 receptor identified a \u223c75:25 mixture of receptor monomers and dimers/oligomers. Both sustained and shorter term treatment with the selective M1 antagonist pirenzepine resulted in a large shift in the distribution of receptor species to favor the dimeric/oligomeric state. Although sustained treatment with pirenzepine also resulted in marked up-regulation of the receptor, simple mass action effects were not the basis for ligand-induced stabilization of receptor dimers/oligomers. The related antagonist telenzepine also produced stabilization and enrichment of the M1 receptor dimer population, but the receptor subtype non-selective antagonists atropine and N-methylscopolamine did not. In contrast, neither pirenzepine nor telenzepine altered the quaternary organization of the related M3 muscarinic receptor. These data provide unique insights into the selective capacity of receptor ligands to promote and/or stabilize receptor dimers/oligomers and demonstrate that the dynamics of ligand regulation of the quaternary organization of G protein-coupled receptors is markedly more complex than previously appreciated. This may have major implications for receptor function and behavior.",

It was aimed to determine the most appropriate time for measuring blood pressure in transition from supine to upright position in order to diagnose OH in elderly. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) including Head up Tilt Table (HUT) test was performed in 407 geriatric patients. Orthostatic changes were assessed separately for the 1st, 3rd and 5th minutes (HUT1, HUT3 and HUT5, respectively) taking the data in supine position as the basis. The mean age, recurrent falls, presence of dementia and Parkinson's disease, number of drugs, alpha-blocker and anti-dementia drug use, and fasting blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the patients with versus without OH; whereas, albumin and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were significantly lower (p<0.05). However, different from HUT3 and HUT5, Charlson Comorbidity Index and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus were higher, the use of antidiabetics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepine, opioid and levodopa were more common (p<0.05). Statistical significance of the number of drugs and fasting blood glucose level was prominent in HUT1 as compared to HUT3 (p<0.01, p<0.05). Comparison of the patients that had OH only in HUT1, HUT3or HUT5 revealed no difference in terms of CGA parameters.

Patients were educated about sedation options and given the choice of undergoing the procedure with no sedation (local anesthetic only), or minimal or moderate sedation. Satisfaction was assessed through three survey questions. No sedation was selected by 53/198 (27%), minimal sedation by 71/198 (36%) and moderate sedation by 74/198 (37%). All subjects would recommend the option to another patient and valued the opportunity to select a sedation option. Post-procedure recovery time differences were statistically significant (p<0.0001) with median recovery times of 0 minutes for no sedation, 38 minutes for minimal sedation and 64 minutes for moderate sedation. In conclusion, patient sedation preference for venous access device placement is variable, signifying there is a role for shared decision-making as it empowers the patient to select the option most aligned with his or her goals. The procedure is well-tolerated, associated with high satisfaction, and the impact on departmental flow is notable because patients choosing no or minimal sedation results in a decreased post-procedure recovery time burden.",

From the 330 participants, most were women, with a family history of mental disorders and bzd use, without monitoring of a psychologist and using other psychotropic and polypharmacy (p>0.05).The minority of prescriptions had indication for the use of bzd (37.5% for older adults and 32.4% for adults) (p>0.05). Only 5.8% of the prescriptions for older adults and 1.9 for adults were rational (p>0.05). The chronic use was observed in all adults and older adults with depressive and anxiety disorders (p>0.05). A minority of prescriptions for adults and older adults was appropriate.", 
    "192": "We propose an integrated and adaptable approach to improve patient care and clinical outcomes through analgesia and light sedation, initiated early during an episode of critical illness and as a priority of care. This strategy, which may be regarded as an evolution of the Pain, Agitation and Delirium guidelines, is conveyed in the mnemonic eCASH-early Comfort using Analgesia, minimal Sedatives and maximal Humane care. eCASH aims to establish optimal patient comfort with minimal sedation as the default presumption for intensive care unit (ICU) patients in the absence of recognised medical requirements for deeper sedation. Effective pain relief is the first priority for implementation of eCASH: we advocate flexible multimodal analgesia designed to minimise use of opioids. Sedation is secondary to pain relief and where possible should be based on agents that can be titrated to a prespecified target level that is subject to regular review and adjustment; routine use of benzodiazepines should be minimised. From the outset, the objective of sedation strategy is to eliminate the use of sedatives at the earliest medically justifiable opportunity. Effective analgesia and minimal sedation contribute to the larger aims of eCASH by facilitating promotion of sleep, early mobilization strategies and improved communication of patients with staff and relatives, all of which may be expected to assist rehabilitation and avoid isolation, confusion and possible long-term psychological complications of an ICU stay. eCASH represents a new paradigm for patient-centred care in the ICU. Some organizational challenges to the implementation of eCASH are identified.",

Although in vitro studies provide some data on the interaction between antipsychotics and retroviral agents, there is a lack of in vitro data on this subject. We describe the case of a 35-year-old patient who suffered from schizophrenia, polydrug abuse and an hiv infection and who also had treatment-resistant psychosis. An interaction between the antiretroviral drug ritonavir and the antipsychotic olanzapine turned out to be the cause of the treatment resistance. As far as we know, this is the first report of such a clinically relevant interaction. We present a review of the current literature on this type of interaction.", 
    "194": "Although several chemical structural classes of synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) were recently classified as Schedule I substances, rates of use and cases of serious toxic effects remain high. While case reports and media bring attention to severe SC toxicity, daily SC use resulting in dependence and withdrawal is a significant concern that is often overlooked when discussing the risks of these drugs. There is a rich literature on evidence-based approaches to treating substance use disorders associated with most abused drugs, yet little has been published regarding how to best treat symptoms related to SC dependence given its recency as an emerging clinically significant issue. This review provides a background of the pharmacology of SCs, recent findings of adverse effects associated with both acute intoxication and withdrawal as a consequence of daily use, and treatment approaches that have been implemented to address these issues, with an emphasis on pharmacotherapies for managing detoxification. In order to determine prevalence of use in cannabis smokers, a population at high risk for SC use, we obtained data on demographics of SC users, frequency of use, and adverse effects over a 3.5-year period (2012-2015) in the New York City metropolitan area, a region with a recent history of high SC use. While controlled studies on the physiological and behavioral effects of SCs are lacking, it is clear that risks associated with using these drugs pertain not only to the unpredictable and severe nature of acute intoxication but also to the effects of long-term, chronic use. Recent reports in the literature parallel findings from our survey, indicating that there is a subset of people who use SCs daily. Although withdrawal has not been systematically characterized and effective treatments have yet to be elucidated, some symptom relief has been reported with benzodiazepines and the atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine. Given the continued use and abuse of SCs, empirical studies characterizing (1) SCs acute effects, (2) withdrawal upon cessation of use, and (3) effective treatment strategies for SC use disorder are urgently needed.", 
    "195": "Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) was previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in eukaryotes, where it is mainly localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Considerable evidence indicates that it plays regulatory roles in steroidogenesis and apoptosis and is involved in various human diseases, such as metastatic cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, inflammation, and anxiety disorders. Ligands of TSPO are widely used as diagnostic tools and treatment options, despite there being no clear understanding of the function of TSPO. An ortholog in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter was independently discovered as the tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) and found to play a role in the response to changes in oxygen and light conditions that regulate photosynthesis and respiration. As part of this highly conserved protein family found in all three kingdoms, the rat TSPO is able to rescue the knockout phenotype in Rhodobacter, indicating functional as well as structural conservation. Recently, a major breakthrough in the field was achieved: the determination of atomic-resolution structures of TSPO from different species by several independent groups. This now allows us to reexamine the function of TSPO with a molecular perspective. In this review, we focus on recently determined structures of TSPO and their implications for potential functions of this ubiquitous multifaceted protein. We suggest that TSPO is an ancient bacterial receptor/stress sensor that has developed additional interactions, partners, and roles in its mitochondrial outer membrane environment in eukaryotes.", 
    "196": "Anxiety is common in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the pre-motor stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). A concomitant and possible cause of this anxiety is microglial activation, also considered a key promoter of neurodegeneration in MCI and early PD via inflammatory mechanisms and the generation of degenerative proinflammatory cytokines. Psychiatric disorders, prevalent in AD and PD, are often treated with psychiatric drugs (psychotropics), raising the question of whether psychotropics might therapeutically affect microglial activation, MCI, and PD. The literature of common psychotropics used in treating psychiatric disorders was reviewed for preclinical and clinical findings regarding microglial activation. Findings potentially compatible with reduced microglial activation or reduced microglial inflammogen release were evident for: antipsychotics including neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, thioridazine, loxapine) and atypicals (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone); mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, valproate, lithium); antidepressants including tricyclics (amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline), SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline), venlafaxine, and bupropion; benzodiazepine anxiolytics (clonazepam, diazepam); cognitive enhancers (donepezil, galantamine, memantine); and other drugs (dextromethorphan, quinidine, amantadine). In contrast, pramipexole and methylphenidate might promote microglial activation. The most promising replicated findings of reduced microglial activation are for quetiapine, valproate, lithium, fluoxetine, donepezil, and memantine but further study is needed and translation of their microglial effects to human disease still requires investigation. In AD-relevant models, risperidone, valproate, lithium, fluoxetine, bupropion, donepezil, and memantine have therapeutic microglial effects in need of replication. Limited clinical data suggest some support for lithium and donepezil in reducing MCI progression, but other drugs have not been studied. In PD-relevant models, lamotrigine, valproate, fluoxetine, dextromethorphan, and amantadine have therapeutic microglial effects whereas methylphenidate induced microglial activation and pramipexole promoted NO release. Clinical data limited to pramipexole do not as of yet indicate faster progression of early PD while the other drugs remain to be investigated. These tantalizing psychotropic neuroprotective findings now invite replication and evidence in AD-and PD-specific models under chronic administration, followed by consideration for clinical trials in MCI and early stage PD. Psychiatric features in early disease may provide opportunities for clinical studies that also employ microglial PET biomarkers.", 
    "197": "Among the new psychoactive substances (NPS), so-called designer benzodiazepines have become of particular importance over the last 2 years, due to their increasing availability on the internet drug market. Therapeutically used nitrobenzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam are known to be extensively metabolized via N-dealkylation to active metabolites and via nitro reduction to the 7-amino compounds. The aim of the present work was to tentatively identify phase I and II metabolites of the latest members of this class appearing on the NPS market, clonazolam, meclonazepam, and nifoxipam, in human urine samples. Nano-liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to provide data about their detectability in urine. Data revealed that clonazolam and meclonazepam were extensively metabolized and mainly excreted as their amino and acetamino metabolites. Nifoxipam was also extensively metabolized, but instead mainly excreted as the acetamino metabolite and a glucuronic acid conjugate of the parent. Based on analysis of human urine samples collected in cases of acute intoxication within the Swedish STRIDA project, and samples submitted for routine drug testing, the most abundant metabolites and good targets for urine drug testing were 7-aminoclonazolam for clonazolam, 7-acetaminomeclonazepam for meclonazepam, and 7-acetaminonifoxipam for nifoxipam.", 
    "198": "Flumazenil is benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. It has been studied for a various indications, including reversal of sedation after surgery or diagnostic procedures, awakening of comatose patients in benzodiazepine overdose, or for symptomatic treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Some drugs, like theophylline, may prolong its elimination half-life. Considering the long half-life of diazepam and its metabolites, concomitant use of theophylline may reduce the need for repeated dosing of flumazenil in patients with acute diazepam poisoning. The aim of this study was to introduce a reliable and accurate method for determining the concentration of flumazenil after therapeutic application in patients with acute poisoning, and using that method to assess whether the kinetics of flumazenil change in the presence of aminophylline (combination of theophylline and ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio) applied as concomitant therapy.", 
    "199": "Blood samples from patients with acute diazepam poisoning that received flumazenil at the dose of 0.5 mg, or the same dose with 3 mg/kg of body weight of aminophylline, were collected 1, 3, 10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after its intravenous administration. Samples were prepared by solid-phase extraction on Oasis HLB cartridges with ethylacetate as extracting agens. Flumazenil was determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in single ionmonitoring mode at m/z 304. Separation of flumazenil from matrix compound was performed on Lichrospher RP-8 column usingthe mixture of acidic acetonitrile and 20 mM of ammonium acetatein water (55 : 45) as a mobile phase.", 
    "200": "The applied analitycal method showed excellent recovery (94.65%). The obtained extracts were much cleaner than the extracts obtained by the sameextractant in the process of liquid-liquid extraction. The limit ofdetection of the LC-MS method described in this paper was 0.5 ng/mL and the limit of quantitation was 1 ng/mL. In the patientstreated with both flumazenil and aminophylline, the eliminationconstant for flumazenil was significantly lower and the elimination half-life was longer (p < 0.05) in comparison with the same parameters in.the patients who received flumazenil alone.", 
    "201": "The applied LC-MS method for the determination of flumazenil in serum samples of patients with acute diazepam poisoning is rapid, sensitive, precise and specific. Concomitant use with theophylline significantly prolonged elimination of flumazenil during the treatment of acute poisonings with diazepam.", 
    "202": "Although injectable anesthetics are still widely used in laboratory rodents, scientific data concerning pain and distress during and after stereotactic surgery are rare. However, optimal anesthesia protocols have a high impact on the quality of the derived data. We therefore investigated the suitability of recommended injectable anesthesia with a traditionally used monoanesthesia for stereotactic surgery in view of optimization and refinement in rats. The influence of the recommended complete reversal anesthesia (MMF; 0.15mg/kg medetomidine, 2mg/kg midazolam, 0.005mg/kg fentanyl; i.m.) with or without reversal and of chloral hydrate (430mg/kg, 3.6%, i.p.) on various physiological, biochemical and behavioral parameters (before, during, after surgery) was analyzed. Isoflurane was also included in stress parameter analysis. In all groups, depth of anesthesia was sufficient for stereotactic surgery with no animal losses. MMF caused transient exophthalmos, myositis at the injection site and increased early postoperative pain scores. Reversal induced agitation, restlessness and hypothermia. Even the low concentrated chloral hydrate led to peritonitis and multifocal liver necrosis, corresponding to increased stress hormone levels and loss in body weight. Increased stress response was also exerted by isoflurane anesthesia. Pronounced systemic toxicity of chloral hydrate strongly questions its further use in rodent anesthesia. In view of undesired effects of MMF and isoflurane, thorough consideration of anesthesia protocols for particular research projects is indispensable. Reversal should be restricted to emergency situations. Our data support further refinement of the current protocols and the importance of sham operated controls.", 
    "203": "Benzodiazepines have been widely used for their anxiolytic actions. However, the contribution of GABAA receptor subtypes to anxiolysis is still controversial. Studies with mutant mice harboring diazepam-insensitive \u03b1-subunits \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, or \u03b15 have revealed that \u03b12-containing GABAA receptors (\u03b12-GABAARs) are required for diazepam-induced anxiolysis, with no evidence for an involvement of any other \u03b1-subunit, whereas TP003, described as a selective modulator of \u03b13-containing GABAA receptors, was shown to be anxiolytic. Here, we describe a novel, systematic approach to evaluate the role of positive allosteric modulation of each of the four diazepam-sensitive \u03b1-subtypes in anxiety-related behavioral paradigms. By combining H to R point mutations in three out of the four diazepam-sensitive \u03b1-subunits in mice with a 129X1/SvJ background, diazepam becomes a subtype-specific modulator of the remaining non-mutated \u03b1-subtype. Modulation of \u03b15-GABAARs, but not of \u03b12-GABAARs, increased the time in the light side of the light-dark box as well as open-arm exploration in the elevated plus maze. In contrast, modulation of \u03b13-GABAARs decreased open-arm exploration, whereas modulation of \u03b12-GABAARs increased time in the center in the open-field test. Modulation of any single \u03b1-subtype had no effect on stress-induced hyperthermia. Our results provide evidence that modulation of \u03b15-GABAARs elicits anxiolytic-like actions, whereas our data do not provide evidence for an anxiolytic-like action of \u03b13-GABAARs. Thus, \u03b15-GABAARs may be suitable targets for novel anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "204": "This writing proposes an overview of chemical processes of isomerisation involving conformations and configurational isomers. Molecular structure is depicted as consisting in A) core features; and B) fluctuating properties. To avoid confusion and misuses in terminology, attention is paid to IUPAC recommendations and definitions, beginning with a focus on conformers versus conformations. Two sections consider rotations, the behaviour of exocyclic single bonds being kept separate from that of endocyclic single bonds. Processes of pyramidal inversions are discussed next, alone and combined with rotations. Given its sometimes unsuspected occurrence in some drug molecules, stereolability at tetracoordinated carbon centres receives particular attention. Stereolabile and stereostable nitrogen-containing groups come next, with a focus on the simultaneous contributions of inversion and rotation as occurring for example in the conformational reversal of saturated aza-heterocycles. The last type of isomerisation to be examined involves complex heterocyclic systems of medicinal relevance. The conclusion points to the mechanistic variety of stereoisomerisation processes, to a continuum in their energy barriers, to their relevance in all fields of stereochemistry, and to the need for junior medicinal chemists to be adequately trained in stereochemistry.",

Use of consensus guidelines is highly recommended to decrease drug side effects and reduce intensive care requirements. Benzodiazepines remain the mainstay of first-line treatment.

Despite this, there is no nationally available protocol for the treatment of SE in adults in Australia. Treatment is therefore variable and often based on international guidelines or familiarity with certain medications. We have developed an Australian-based algorithm for the treatment of SE, focusing on simplifying management while delivering the safest possible care. We believe this algorithm is suitable for all health practitioners, regardless of training or experience.",

    "209": "The pathogenesis of HE is complex and incompletely understood, but ammonia appears to play a central role. Hyperammonemia leads to accumulation of glutamine in astrocytes, with subsequent astrocyte swelling and neurological dysfunction. The development of HE in patients with hepatic cirrhosis is a poor prognostic indicator. The fermentable disaccharide lactulose and the antimicrobial rifaximin are US Food and Drug Administration approved treatments for human HE. Severe protein restriction is no longer recommended for patients with this condition.", 
    "210": "HE is often associated with portosystemic shunting in dogs and cats. Ammonia plays a central role in the pathogenesis of HE in dogs and cats, but other factors such as manganese and endogenous benzodiazepines may also contribute. Recently, a soy protein-based diet was found to be beneficial in treating canine HE. Severe dietary protein restriction is likely to be detrimental in affected animals. There have been no clinical trials of drugs routinely used in the management HE in veterinary medicine, but lactulose and antimicrobials such as metronidazole are well-established treatments.", 
    "211": "HE is a potentially life-threatening condition that is probably underdiagnosed in companion animals. Although various treatment recommendations have been proposed, there is a lack of evidence in the veterinary literature regarding optimal strategies for the management of this condition. As our understanding of the pathogenesis of HE in dogs and cats evolves, novel diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents may become available.",

    "213": "Sleep has a strong influence on interictal epileptiform discharges and on epileptic seizures. Interictal epileptiform discharges are activated by sleep deprivation and sleep, and some epilepsies occur almost exclusively during sleep. Treatment of sleep-related epilepsy should take in account the type of epileptic syndrome, the type of seizures, the patient characteristics, and also the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Proper characterization of the epilepsy is essential to choose appropriate antiepileptic drugs. Drugs effective in focal epilepsy may be used to treat benign genetic focal epilepsies such as rolandic epilepsy and other focal (frontal or not) sleep epilepsies. These include both classical (such as carbamazepine) and new (such as levetiracetam and lacosamide) antiepileptic drugs. Drug-resistant cases should be evaluated for epilepsy surgery, which may be efficacious in this setting. Valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and perampanel are effective against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in genetic generalized epilepsies, which frequently happen on awakening. Risks of valproate should be considered before prescribing it to women of childbearing age. Specific syndromes such as ESES require specific treatment such as a combination of high dose steroids, benzodiazepines, levetiracetam, and even surgery when an epileptogenic lesion is present. Sleep disorders that may worsen epilepsy such as obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia should be adequately treated to improve seizure frequency. Adequate control of seizures during sleep (especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures) decreases risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).",

Patients were asked to grade FB as being easy or difficult to tolerate. The primary endpoint was tolerability and the secondary endpoints included complications associated with the procedure.", 
    "216": "A total of 80 patients were included in the study. A significantly lower number of patients in the deep sedation group reported that the technique was difficult to tolerate (5.0% vs. 40.0%, moderate sedation group; P<0.001). However, the dose of oxygen required to maintain an oxygen saturation of \u226590% was higher in the deep sedation group (7.3\u00b14.7 vs. 2.7\u00b11.6 L/min; P<0.0001). There were no cases of prolonged oxygen desaturation or deaths related to FB in either group.", 
    "217": "In the present study, deep sedation had a beneficial effect on patient tolerance to FB. Although oxygen desaturation during FB represents a potentially serious complication, deep sedation may be considered to be a useful premedication for FB.", 
    "218": "Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed psycho-pharmaceuticals (e.g., for anxiety, tension, and insomnia); they are generally considered safe but have potential adverse effects. Benzodiazepine use in Canada versus internationally is comparably high, yet no recent comprehensive review of use, misuse, or related (e.g., morbidity, mortality) harm at the population level exists; the present review aimed to fill this gap. We searched four key scientific literature databases (Medline, CINAHL, EBM Reviews, and Web of Science) with relevant search terms, and collected relevant \"gray literature\" (e.g., survey, monitoring, government reports) data published in 1995-2015. Two reviewers conducted data screening and extraction; results were categorized and narratively summarized by key sub-topics. Levels of benzodiazepine use in the general population have been relatively stable in recent years; medical use is generally highest among older adults. Rates of non-medical use are fairly low in general but higher in marginalized (e.g., street drug use) populations; high and/or inappropriate prescribing appears common in older adults. Benzodiazepines are associated with various morbidity outcomes (e.g., accidents/injuries, cognitive decline, sleep disturbances, or psychiatric issues), again commonly observed in older adults; moreover, benzodiazepines are identified as a contributing factor in suicides and poisoning deaths. Overall there is a substantial benzodiazepine-related health problem burden-although lower than that for other psycho-medications (e.g., opioids)-in Canada, mainly as a result of overuse and/or morbidity. National benzodiazepine prescription guidelines are lacking, and few evaluated interventions to reduce benzodiazepine-related problems exist. There is a clear need for reducing inappropriate benzodiazepine use and related harm in Canada through improved evidence-based practice as well as monitoring and control.", 
    "219": "Pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) are covalent-binding DNA-interactive agents with growing importance as payloads in Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs). Until now, PBDs were thought to covalently bond to C2-NH2 groups of guanines in the DNA-minor groove across a three-base-pair recognition sequence. Using HPLC/MS methodology with designed hairpin and duplex oligonucleotides, we have now demonstrated that the PBD Dimer SJG-136 and the C8-conjugated PBD Monomer GWL-78 can covalently bond to a terminal guanine of DNA, with the PBD skeleton spanning only two base pairs. Control experiments with the non-C8-conjugated anthramycin along with molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the C8-substituent of a PBD Monomer, or one-half of a PBD Dimer, may provide stability for the adduct. This observation highlights the importance of PBD C8-substituents, and also suggests that PBDs may bind to terminal guanines within stretches of DNA in cells, thus representing a potentially novel mechanism of action at the end of DNA strand breaks.", 
    "220": "Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide, but its underlying mechanisms have not yet been clarified. Among the possible molecular mechanisms that underlie its occurrence are those that are responsible for the neuronal ionic gradient, including the transmembrane enzyme Na+,K+;-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). Na+,K+-ATPase plays an important role in controlling neuronal excitability, and it is believed to be related to the pathophysiology of epilepsy. However, the specific isozymes that may be related to this neurological disorder remain to be determined. The \u03b13 subunit-containing Na+,K+-ATPase isozyme has high affinity for ouabain and appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of epilepsies. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the possible participation of Na+,K+- ATPase isozymes with lower affinity for ouabain (i.e., those that contain the \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunits).", 
    "221": "The present study investigated whether rats with high (HTR) and low (LTR) thresholds for clonic convulsions that are induced by a benzodiazepine inverse agonist differ in the binding of [3;H]- ouabain to Na+,K+-ATPase isozymes with lower affinity to ouabain in discrete brain regions.",

However, whether a particular benzodiazepine is of superior efficacy and safety in management of CSE is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the outcome of lorazepam and diazepam for treating CSE. We searched the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar databases from 1966 to February 2014. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of all the selected articles were hand-searched for any additional trials. Trial quality was assessed using the modified Jadad scale and the Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. Two authors independently extracted data from all eligible studies, including study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. The data was analyzed using fixed-effects or random-effects models with mean differences and risk ratios for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. A total of six studies involving 970 patients were included in this analysis. The majority of patients were children (n=574) and 396 patients were adults. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding seizure control and adverse effects regardless of patient age. This meta-analysis demonstrates that diazepam and lorazepam have equal efficacy and side effects for treating CSE in adults and children, and either can be chosen as a reasonable first-line therapy. More high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to support this finding.",

The effects of acute and chronic DHEAS administration on the locomotor activity, motor coordination, and body weight of the mice were also studied. We also investigated the effects of DHEAS treatment on [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the mouse brain membranes.", 
    "227": "DHEAS did not modify the locomotor activity, motor coordination, body weight, and brain [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding of male and female mice.

However, small but significant changes regarding sex differences in the susceptibility to seizures were observed following DHEAS administration to mice.", 
    "228": "Although our findings suggest that DHEAS treatment might be safe for various potential therapeutic applications in adult as well as in old age, they also support subtle interaction of DHEAS with male and female hormonal status, which may underline observed sex differences in the relationship between DHEAS and various health outcomes.", 
    "229": "The increasing knowledge about the human microbiome leads to the awareness of how important probiotics can be for our health. Although further substantiation is required, it appears that several pathologies could be treated or prevented by the administration of pharmaceutical formulations containing such live health-beneficial bacteria. These pharmabiotics need to provide their effects until the end of shelf life, which can be optimally achieved by drying them before further formulation. However, drying processes, including spray-, freeze-, vacuum- and fluidized bed drying, induce stress on probiotics, thus decreasing their viability. Several protection strategies can be envisaged to enhance their viability, including addition of protective agents, controlling the process parameters and prestressing the probiotics prior to drying. Moreover, probiotic viability needs to be maintained during long-term storage. Overall, lower storage temperature and low moisture content result in good survival rates. Attention should also be given to the rehydration conditions of the dried probiotics, as this can exert an important effect on their revival. By describing not only the characteristics, but also the viability results obtained by the most relevant drying techniques in the probiotic industry, we hope to facilitate the deliberate choice of drying process and protection strategy for specific probiotic and pharmabiotic applications."
