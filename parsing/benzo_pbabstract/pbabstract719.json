    "0": "Diphenylhydantoin and diazepam are two useful antiepileptic drugs. Though not obviously related chemically, their molecular conformations exhibit marked similarities. These similarities indicate a steric basis for their anticonvulsant activity and lead to conclusions about the receptor sites for this type of pharmaceutical.", 
    "1": "1. The effects of alpha and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, depletion of catecholamine stores, vagotomy, atropine, and ganglionic blockade on diazepam-induced vasodilatation were investigated in forty-six anaesthetized dogs.2. Coronary blood flow was measured by timed collections of coronary venous efflux from fibrillating, decompressed ventricles; coronary and systemic vascular resistances were determined during total cardiopulmonary bypass under conditions of normothermia and constant aortic (coronary artery) pressure.3. No significant alteration in the vasodilatation produced by diazepam was observed following either vagotomy or alpha-adrenoceptor blockade; partial inhibition of vasodilatation occurred after beta-adrenoceptor blockade or catecholamine depletion, and nearly total inhibition was observed after small doses of atropine or ganglion-blocking agents.4. The results suggest that diazepam may act as a specific ganglion-stimulant, causing active sympathetic and cholinergic vasodilatation.", 
    "2": "Forty-eight patients with anxiety states were treated with oxazepam (Serenid-D), which was administered in tablets of three different colours-red, yellow, and green. Every patient received one week's treatment with each colour, according to a random programme. A latin square design was used to ensure complete balance between the colours and between the weeks. The patients' symptoms were categorized and then assessed by both weekly physicians' ratings and daily self-rating, which showed close agreement. Colour preference was shown on both these scales in that symptoms of anxiety were most improved with green, whereas depressive symptoms appeared to respond best to yellow. Such colour preferences, however, did not reach levels of statistical significance, except for phobias as rated on the physicians' assessment.The results indicate that colour may play a part in the response to a drug.", 
    "3": "Diazepam has been found to increase the duration of the neuromuscular block produced by gallamine and to reduce that produced by succinylcholine. Preliminary studies suggest that the action is at the presynaptic site.", 
    "4": "The effect of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) on thyroid function was examined in 14 euthyroid patients who required the drug for psychiatric reasons and in six patients with clinically mild thyrotoxicosis. There was no significant difference in results from tests of thyroid iodide trapping (thyroid radioiodine uptake, thyroid clearance, and absolute iodine uptake) or of thyroid hormone release (protein-bound iodine, T3 resin uptake, and free thyroxine index) carried out before and during treatment with the drug over a four-week period. It is suggested that chlordiazepoxide need not be withdrawn before thyroid status and function are assessed in any patient taking the drug.", 
    "5": "1. The effects of diazepam (Valium) on coronary and systemic vascular resistance were studied in anaesthetized dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass under conditions of constant heart rate and aortic pressure.2. Pharmacological doses of diazepam uniformly produced coronary vasodilation lasting 30 min; systemic vascular resistance also decreased, but to lesser degree.3. When coronary blood flow was maintained constant at physiological levels, diazepam produced no changes in left ventricular contractility, as assessed by peak LV isovolumetric pressure, dp/dt max, force-velocity, and length-tension relations, whereas previous experiments had demonstrated a positive inotropic effect in a similar preparation in which coronary blood flow was responsive to alterations in coronary vascular resistance.4. In five dogs, complete separation of the coronary and systemic circulations was accomplished by a double pump-oxygenator system; direct intracoronary administration of diazepam produced coronary vasodilatation, but coronary pressure and flow were not altered by administration of diazepam to the systemic circulation.5. It is concluded that diazepam augments myocardial contractility by increasing coronary blood flow. This relationship is independent of extracardiac humoral mechanisms, and appears to require the delivery of diazepam to the coronary circulation."
