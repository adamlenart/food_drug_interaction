Signs and symptoms of the parkinsonian syndrome are summarized as well as the current treatment options of early Parkinson's disease.", 
    "1": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, accompanied by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations that diminish with motor activity and worsen at rest. The symptoms of this syndrome worsen in the evening and at night, leading to difficulty in sleeping. Treatment of RLS includes non-pharmacological intervention and drug therapy. In this article, we examine recent developments in the understanding of the pathophysiology of RLS and review previous articles on the treatment of RLS. Although there have been no reports on formal studies on the nonpharmacologic strategies for RLS symptoms, recommened good sleep hygiene is considered essential to improve the comorbid insomnia. Massaging the affected legs, taking hot baths, and performing mentally demanding tasks have been reported to reduce RLS symptoms. Four categories of medications, namely, dopaminergic agents, opioids, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines were identified as frequently prescribed drugs for RLS. Dopaminergic agonists are now considered the first-line treatment of RLS because they are more effective and produce augmentation less frequently as compared to L-dopa. Opioids are prescribed to patients with severe conditions, especially those unresponsive to other treatments. Currently, carbamazepine is not recommended for the treatment of RLS. More recently, studies on the use of anticonvulsants for the treatment of RLS have focused on gabapentin. Benzodiazepines, including clonazepam and nitrazepam, are widely prescribed, but their therapeutic effects on RLS symptoms were rather modest. Therefore, benzodiazepines are mostly used to improve the sleep quality in patients with RLS.", 
    "2": "Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, is administered preoperatively and intraoperatively for amnesia and anxiolysis. Subsequently, patients often do not recall events which occurred while they were sedated. Recent studies have also reported retrograde facilitation after midazolam exposure. Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is based on memory of a traumatic event. Because of the concern that midazolam may enhance memory of the traumatic event in which soldiers were injured, we investigated the prevalence of PTSD in those burned soldiers who received perioperative midazolam and those who did not. We also investigated the intensity of the memories related to the traumatic event.", 
    "3": "After institutional review board approval, all charts of US soldiers who completed the PTSD Checklist-Military (PCL-M) screening tool (2004-2008) after admission to US Army Institute of Surgical Research were reviewed to determine the number of operations, the anesthetic regime, total body surface area (TBSA) burned, and Injury Severity Score (ISS).", 
    "4": "The PCL-M was completed by 370 burned soldiers from Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom. During surgery, 142 received midazolam, whereas 69 did not. The prevalence of PTSD was higher in soldiers receiving midazolam as compared with those who did not (29% vs. 25%) (p = 0.481). Both groups had similar injuries based on TBSA and ISS. Patients who received midazolam also had similar scores on PCL-M questions related to memory of the event.", 
    "5": "Rates of PTSD are not statistically different in combat casualties receiving midazolam during intraoperative procedures. Intraoperative midazolam is not associated with increased PTSD development or with increased intensity of memory of the traumatic event. Patients receiving midazolam had similar injuries (TBSA and ISS) and underwent a similar number of operations as those not receiving midazolam.", 
    "6": "The common occurrence and high level of morbidity and burden associated with social anxiety disorder (SAD) are gaining widespread recognition. Interest in understanding and treating the disorder has also grown in response to large-scale investigations that have demonstrated high levels of efficacy with both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Such trials indicate that many patients with generalized SAD (roughly 40% to 60%) respond (eg, Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement rating 1 or 2) after an adequate treatment trial, despite having suffered with disabling symptoms for most of their adult lives. First-line therapy options include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the dual-acting serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Second-line options consist of anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, valproic acid) and benzodiazepines (clonazepam). Reversible and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (moclobemide and phenelzine, respectively), while effective, are not widely used. Nonpharmacologic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), are also effective for SAD. Newer treatment strategies such as levetiracetam, atypical antipsychotics, or D-cycloserine in combination with CBT appear promising but require further investigation. Finding a well-tolerated, safe, and effective treatment for each individual patient is crucial as most will require ongoing treatment in order to maintain benefits, prevent SAD relapse, and to experience optimal outcomes in the long term.", 
    "7": "Olanzapine treatment has been associated with clinically meaningful weight increases, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus. There are few options for olanzapine responders who fail other antipsychotic agents. Aripiprazole is a potent (high-affinity) partial agonist at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and a potent antagonist at 5-HT2A receptor and is associated with less weight gain than olanzapine. We report the results of a 10-week placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study that examined 15 mg/d aripiprazole's effects on weight, lipids, glucose metabolism, and psychopathology in overweight and obese schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder subjects treated with a stable dose of olanzapine. During the 4 weeks of aripiprazole treatment, there were significant decreases in weight (P = 0.003) and body mass index (P = 0.004) compared with placebo. Total serum cholesterol (P = 0.208), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; P = 0.99), HDL-2 (P = 0.08), HDL-3 (P = 0.495), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.665) did not change significantly comparing aripiprazole treatment to placebo treatment. However, total serum triglycerides (P = 0.001), total very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C; P = 0.01), and VLDL-1C and VLDL-2C (P = 0.012) decreased significantly during the aripiprazole treatment phase. The VLDL-3C tended lower during aripiprazole, but the decrease was not significant (P = 0.062). There was a decrease in C-reactive protein comparing aripiprazole treatment to placebo, although it did not reach significance (P = 0.087). The addition of aripiprazole to a stable dose of olanzapine was well tolerated and resulted in significant improvements on several outcome measures that predict risk for medical morbidity.", 
    "8": "Observations in controlled trials and case reports have linked lithium exposure to induction or exacerbation of psoriasis. A causal relationship between lithium exposure and incident psoriasis has been questioned, and observational studies are lacking.", 
    "9": "We conducted a case-control analysis using the United Kingdom-based General Practice Research Database to study the association between the use of lithium or antipsychotics and the risk of developing an incident diagnosis of psoriasis. We identified cases with an incident diagnosis of psoriasis between 1994 and 2005, and controls were matched to the cases on age, sex, general practice, calendar time, and years of history in the database. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the risk of developing a first-time diagnosis of psoriasis in relation to previous exposure to lithium and antipsychotic drugs, stratified by exposure timing and duration. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for smoking, body mass index, and additional potential confounders.",

Groups were well matched for sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and smoking. After adjustment for differences in age and illness duration, groups were compared for the insulin resistance index (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) and fasting concentrations of glucose, lipids, insulin, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), adiponectin, leptin, and cortisol. Correlations were examined between serum olanzapine and hormonal levels, and between leptin concentrations and BMI in both sexes.",

Olanzapine-treated subjects had the highest insulin concentrations and the lowest SHBG, adiponectin, and cortisol concentrations. Olanzapine-treated female subjects had significantly higher leptin (P = 0.005) and lower SHBG (P = 0.023) concentrations than other subjects. In female subjects, serum olanzapine concentrations were correlated with hormonal levels, and a significant proportion of olanzapine-treated female subjects had abnormal correlations between serum leptin levels and BMI.",

    "16": "Midazolam is a commonly used sedative and anaesthetic adjuvant and the agent is known to decrease core temperature by core-to-periphery redistribution of heat. We tested the hypothesis that forced-air warming could effectively prevent midazolam-induced hypothermia.", 
    "17": "Six healthy male volunteers were studied over 3 days. On the first day, the volunteers were alert during a 30 min control period with forced-air warming. On the second day, after the volunteers were vasoconstricted, 75 microg kg(-1) midazolam was injected intramuscularly and they were covered with a cotton blanket. On the third day, after the volunteers were vasoconstricted, 75 microg kg(-1) midazolam was again administered and they were given forced-air warming. Tympanic temperature was measured as the core temperature. Four adhesive skin-surface probes with thermocouples were fixed on the chest, upper right arm, lateral calf and thigh, and both mean skin and body temperatures were calculated. Fingertip perfusion was evaluated using forearm minus fingertip and calf minus toe skin-surface temperature gradients. Thirty minutes after the intramuscular injection of midazolam, the level of sedation in volunteers was measured by a blinded observer according to the alertness/sedation scale.", 
    "18": "Core temperature significantly decreased by midazolam premedication in a time-dependent manner. Although forced-air warming did not prevent the midazolam-induced transient decrease in core temperature, it increased the temperature to the control level thereafter.", 
    "19": "We conclude that forced-air warming can effectively prevent midazolam-induced redistribution hypothermia.", 
    "20": "Mitochondrial calcium (Ca(2+)) dyshomeostasis constitutes a critical step in the metabolic crossroads leading to cell death. Therefore, we have studied here whether 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one (CGP37157; CGP), a blocker of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (mNCX), protects against veratridine-elicited chromaffin cell death, a model suitable to study cell death associated with Ca(2+) overload. Veratridine produced a concentration-dependent cell death, measured as lactate dehydrogenase released into the medium after a 24-h incubation period. CGP rescued cells from veratridine-elicited death in a concentration-dependent manner; its EC(50) was approximately 10 microM, and 20 to 30 microM caused near 100% cytoprotection. If preincubated for 30 min and washed out for 3 min before adding veratridine, CGP still afforded significant cytoprotection. At 30 microM, CGP blocked the veratridine-elicited free radical production, mitochondrial depolarization, and cytochrome c release. At this concentration, CGP also inhibited the Na(+) and Ca(2+) currents by 50 to 60% and the veratridine-elicited oscillations of cytosolic Ca(2+). This drastic cytoprotective effect of CGP could be explained in part through its regulatory actions on the mNCX.",

Included patients were continuously enrolled and initiated with olanzapine or quetiapine monotherapy after a 90-day washout period. Treatment costs were calculated for 1-year post-therapy initiation and inflation adjusted to year 2003. To control for selection bias, olanzapine and quetiapine patients were 1:1 matched using an optimal matching algorithm on propensity score, which was generated using logistic regression controlling for demographics, prior drug therapy, utilization, and costs. Treatment costs for the matched cohorts were compared directly, as well as using a difference-in-difference analysis.",

After propensity score matching, 2321 patient pairs had similar baseline characteristics, including total costs. Compared with matched quetiapine patients, for the 1-year postindex period, olanzapine patients had similar drug costs ($6131 vs. $6014, P = 0.326), lower medical costs ($9897 vs. $11,218, P = 0.0128), and lower total health-care costs ($16,028 vs. $17,232, P = 0.0279). Lower psychiatric hospitalization costs account for most of the total cost difference. Difference-in-difference regression analysis confirmed olanzapine's economic advantage. Further adjusting for baseline variations, the total cost advantage of olanzapine patients was $962 (P = 0.032), and was mostly because of reduced psychiatric hospitalization costs of $992 (P = 0.004).",

    "26": "The administration of benzodiazepine receptor agonists for periods of 3-4 weeks can be considered as evidence based for the treatment of insomnia. The off-label treatment of insomnia with sedating antidepressants or antipsychotics up to now has been subjected to far less rigorous evidence-based testing. In the meantime several randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies indicate the effectiveness of sedating antidepressants for insomnia. Alternative medical treatments like the administration of melatonin or valerian are characterized by a heterogeneous database. On the contrary, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (including psycho-education, relaxation, stimulus control, sleep restriction, cognitive therapy) is supported by an extensive database. This database indicates that cognitive behavioural methods are effective in the long term, thus emphasizing the importance of these strategies in the treatment of insomnia. Studies on the combination treatment of insomnia with hypnotics and cognitive behavioural therapy up to now were not able to show a superiority of the combination treatment versus monotreatment with behavioural therapy or hypnotics.", 
    "27": "The genes that encode for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are located in the same region (CYP3A cluster) on chromosome 7. Midazolam (MDZ) is a substrate for both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. We hypothesize that MDZ disposition in vivo is associated with genotypes of the CYP3A cluster. A meta-analysis of the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters from seven clinical trials was carried out, in which MDZ was administered both intravenously and orally. DNA samples were available from 116 patients. There were significant ethnic differences in the allelic frequencies of these four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP3A cluster. Significant linkage disequilibrium was found between CYP3A5(*)3 and CYP3A4(*)1A in Caucasians, and between CYP3A5(*)1 and CYP3A4(*)1B in African Americans. There were no differences in MDZ disposition in vivo between different genotypes, haplotypes and diplotypes in the CYP3A cluster (P>0.05). No significant differences in MDZ PK parameters were observed between Caucasians and African Americans. Women had higher weight-corrected systemic and oral clearance than men, but dose-adjusted AUC and bioavailability differences were not observed between sexes. The clinical importance of elevated CYP3A activity in women remains to be determined. The r(GC)'s of MDZ PK parameters were between 0.3 and 13.6%. In conclusion, the meta-analysis of seven studies suggests that environmental factors explain the majority of CYP3A activity variation. Further studies are necessary to define the functional significance of SNPs in the CYP3A cluster and the effects of CYP3A genotypes on MDZ disposition in vivo.", 
    "28": "Preoperative anxiety and emergence delirium in children continue to be common even with midazolam premedication. Midazolam is unpleasant tasting even with a flavored vehicle and as a result, patient acceptance is sometimes poor. As an alternative, we evaluated dexmedetomidine administered intranasally. Dexmedetomidine an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist is tasteless, odorless, and painless when administered by this route. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists produce sedation, facilitate parental separation, and improve conditions for induction of general anesthesia, while preserving airway reflexes. Institutional review board approval was obtained to study 100 pediatric patients randomized to intranasal dexmedetomidine (2 microg/kg) or oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) administered 30 to 45 minutes before the surgery. Subjects received general anesthesia with oxygen, nitrous oxide, isoflurane, and analgesics (0.05-0.1 mg/kg morphine or 0.1 mg/kg methadone). Nurses and anesthetists were blinded to the drug administered and evaluated patients for preoperative sedation, conditions for induction of general anesthesia, emergence from anesthesia, and postoperative pain. Responses of 100 patients (50 dexmedetomidine and 50 midazolam) were analyzed. Dexmedetomidine (P=.003) was more effective than midazolam at inducing sleep preoperatively. Dexmedetomidine and midazolam were comparable for conditions at induction (P>0.05), emergence from anesthesia (P>0.05), or postoperative pain (P>0.05). Both drugs were equieffective in these regards. In pediatric patients, dexmedetomidine 2 microg/kg administered intranasally and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg administered orally produced similar conditions during induction and emergence of anesthesia. Intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine is more effective at inducing sleep and in some circumstances offers a useful alternative to oral midazolam in children.",

Sedative procedures can prevent dental care-induced stress, even when there is effective pain control, but they have to be adapted to accommodate age-induced physiological modifications, age-related pathologies, and the concomitant treatments. In many situations, routine sedative prescriptions for dental care, such as benzodiazepine or antihistaminics, are not recommended for these patients. Nitrous oxide inhalation together with a specific behavioral threshold is currently the only sedative procedure adapted to cognitively-impaired elderly patients. Nitrous oxide is able to curb stress and its cardiovascular consequences, improve oxygenation, and optimize cooperation during dental care, making not only rehabilitation treatments but also routine dental care a viable option.", 
    "39": "Several studies indicate that cholesterol esterification is deregulated in cancers. The present study aimed to characterize the role of cholesterol esterification in proliferation and invasion of two tumor cells expressing an activated cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK2R). A significant increase in cholesterol esterification and activity of Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) was measured in tumor cells expressing a constitutively activated oncogenic mutant of the CCK2R (CCK2R-E151A cells) compared with nontumor cells expressing the wild-type CCK2R (CCK2R-WT cells). Inhibition of cholesteryl ester formation and ACAT activity by Sah58-035, an inhibitor of ACAT, decreased by 34% and 73% CCK2R-E151A cell growth and invasion. Sustained activation of CCK2R-WT cells by gastrin increased cholesteryl ester production while addition of cholesteryl oleate to the culture medium of CCK2R-WT cells increased cell proliferation and invasion to a level close to that of CCK2R-E151A cells. In U87 glioma cells, a model of autocrine growth stimulation of the CCK2R, inhibition of cholesterol esterification and ACAT activity by Sah58-035 and two selective antagonists of the CCK2R significantly reduced cell proliferation and invasion. In both models, cholesteryl ester formation was found dependent on protein kinase zeta/ extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (PKCzeta/ERK1/2) activation. These results show that signaling through ACAT/cholesterol esterification is a novel pathway for the CCK2R that contributes to tumor cell proliferation and invasion.", 
    "40": "Benzodiazepines increase food intake, an effect attributed to their ability to enhance palatability. We investigated which GABA(A) receptor subtypes may be involved in mediating benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia. The role of the alpha2 subtype was investigated by observing the effects of midazolam, on the behavioural satiety sequence in mice with targeted deletion of the alpha2 gene (alpha2 knockout). Midazolam (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5mg/kg) increased food intake and the amount of time spent feeding in alpha2 knockout mice, suggesting that BZ-induced hyperphagia does not involve alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors. We further investigated the roles of alpha1- and alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors in mediating BZ-induced hyperphagia. We treated alpha2(H101R) mice, in which alpha2-containing receptors are rendered benzodiazepine insensitive, with L-838417, a compound which acts as a partial agonist at alpha2-, alpha3- and alpha5-receptors but is inactive at alpha1-containing receptors. L-838417 (10 and 30 mg/kg) increased food intake and the time spent feeding in both wildtype and alpha2(H101R) mice, demonstrating that benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia does not require alpha1- and alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors. These observations, together with evidence against the involvement of alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors, suggest that alpha3-containing receptors mediate BZ-induced hyperphagia in the mouse.",

The most important independent predictors of emesis are unusually high intravenous (IV) dose (initial dose of > or =2.5 mg/kg or a total dose of > or =5.0 mg/kg), intramuscular (IM) route, and increasing age (peak at 12 years). Similar risk factors for any recovery agitation are low IM dose (<3.0 mg/kg) and unusually high IV dose, with no such important risk factors for clinically important recovery agitation.", 
    "44": "Early adolescence is the peak age for ketamine-associated emesis, and its rate is higher with IM administration and with unusually high IV doses. Recovery agitation is not age related to a clinically important degree. When we interpreted it in conjunction with the separate airway adverse event phase of this analysis, we found no apparent clinically important benefit or harm from coadministered anticholinergics and benzodiazepines and no increase in adverse events with either oropharyngeal procedures or the presence of substantial underlying illness.

All drugs were successfully separated within 12 min using combined scan and selected ion recording (SIR) mode. The calibration curves of most drugs were linear in the concentration range 0.5-250 ng/mL with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.99.

    "46": "SOHO is a 3-year, prospective, observational study of schizophrenia patients who started a new antipsychotic in 10 European countries. Cohorts of patients were defined according to the antipsychotic started at baseline: olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpride, clozapine, oral typical and depot typical antipsychotics. Tolerability in terms of rates of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia (TD), anticholinergic use, loss of libido/impotence, amenorrhoea/galactorrhoea/gynaecomastia, and weight change was assessed in 4939 patients who started monotherapy. Logistic regression models related medication initiated at study entry to adverse events over follow-up, adjusting by baseline differences among treatment cohorts. Patients taking typical antipsychotics or risperidone were more likely to experience EPS and TD during follow-up than patients taking olanzapine. Patients taking olanzapine were less likely to have loss of libido/impotence during follow-up than patients in the risperidone, amisulpride, clozapine, oral typical and depot typical cohorts. Weight gain occurred in all groups, but was greater with olanzapine. In conclusion, antipsychotics have different tolerability profiles in terms of the adverse events we monitored. Results should be interpreted conservatively due to the observational study design.",

We have investigated morphological behaviour and specific functions of primary human hepatocytes on native and modified PEEK-WC-PU membranes in a small-scale gas-permeable bioreactor. N-containing groups grafted at the surface of the membranes improved the initial steps of adhesion and the maintenance of phenotype and differentiated functions of cells. Confocal microscopy of cell morphology evidenced human hepatocytes exhibiting a polygonal shape and organizing a 3D structure. The presence of CK19 positive cells, a marker of biliary duct epithelium, was also found on native and modified membranes. Liver specific functions, investigated in terms of urea production, albumin synthesis and diazepam biotransformation, were maintained at high levels up to 19 days, particularly on surface-modified membranes.",

Cardiovascular toxicity was common with older psychiatric medications but seems uncommon with AAPM. We conducted a systematic literature review to describe the cardiovascular effects reported after overdose of 5 common AAPM: aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. We included case reports and case series describing overdose of these 5 medications identified in a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and abstracts from major toxicology meetings. We found 13 pediatric cases (age, <7 years), 22 adolescent cases (age, 7-16 years), and 185 adult cases. No pediatric case described a ventricular dysrhythmia or a cardiovascular death. In the adolescent and adult cases, we found numerous reports of prolonged corrected QT interval and hypotension, but there were only 3 cases of ventricular dysrhythmia and 3 deaths that may have been due to direct cardiovascular toxicity. The results from case series reports were similar to the single case report data. Our review suggests that overdose of AAPM is unlikely to cause significant cardiovascular toxicity.", 
    "59": "AC-5216, a ligand for the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), produces anxiolytic-like effects in animal models of anxiety without causing the side effects normally associated with conventional benzodiazepines. This study aimed to investigate whether repeated administration of AC-5216 induces tolerance to anxiolytic-like effects of AC-5216 and produces withdrawal on abrupt cessation, and compare the results with those of diazepam. In the tolerance experiment, AC-5216 (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) produced significant anxiolytic-like effects in both groups of mice pretreated with the vehicle and AC-5216 twice daily for 14 days. Diazepam (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) also retained its anxiolytic effects in mice repeatedly treated with diazepam. In the withdrawal experiment, mice were orally treated with either AC-5216 (0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg; twice daily) or diazepam (0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg; twice daily) for 14 days, and examined, during a treatment withdrawal period, for anxiogenic-like effects in the social interaction test, and for body weight loss as indices of emotional and somatic withdrawal symptoms, respectively. In AC-5216-treated groups, neither anxiogenic-like effects nor body weight loss was observed upon treatment withdrawal at any of the doses tested. In contrast, in diazepam 1 mg/kg- and 10 mg/kg-treated groups, treatment withdrawal not only induced anxiogenic-like effects on the second day of the withdrawal period, but also decreased body weight gain and brought about body weight loss in mice. These findings indicate that AC-5216 when repeatedly administered does not induce tolerance to its anxiolytic-like effects or withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "60": "Harmaline-induced tremor in rodents is a model of essential tremor. We utilized a novel assay to quantify tremor activity in mice and found that tremor activity was dependent on harmaline dose. The first-line clinical essential tremor treatments propranolol, primidone and gabapentin and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) significantly attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. The anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine and the mood stabilizer lithium suppressed harmaline-induced tremor. The gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptor subtype A receptor agonist muscimol attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. By contrast, the GABA(B) receptor agonist R-baclofen increased tremor at the lowest dose tested, but had no effects at higher doses. Administration of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists phencyclidine or 5R,10S-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. The competitive NMDA antagonist D-4-[(2E)-3-phosphono-2-propenyl]-2-piperazinecarboxylic acid (d-CPPene) dose-dependently blocked harmaline-induced tremor, as did the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium salt (NBQX). The metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 (mGlu5) receptor antagonist 6-methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) was inactive against tremor. The dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR12909 and the dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor agonist apomorphine attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. Follow-up studies indicated that dopamine D(2)/D(3) but not dopamine D(1) receptor activation likely mediates the effects of apomorphine and GBR12909. Administration of compounds with sedative side-effects had no effect on tremor activity. In summary, the present data confirm the pharmacological validity of harmaline-induced tremor in mice, quantified via a novel assay, as an animal model of essential tremor. Further, these data provide additional evidence for the roles of ionotropic glutamate, GABA(A) and dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors in the neurobiology of harmaline-induced tremor.", 
    "61": "Layer 6b in neocortex is a distinct sublamina at the ventral portion of layer 6. Corticothalamic projections arise from 6b neurons, but few studies have examined the functional properties of these cells. In the present study we examined the actions of cholecystokinin (CCK) on layer 6b neocortical neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques. We found that the general CCK receptor agonist CCK8S (sulfated CCK octapeptide) strongly depolarized the neurons, and this action persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin, suggesting a postsynaptic site of action. The excitatory actions of CCK8S were mimicked by the selective CCK(B) receptor agonist CCK4, and attenuated by the selective CCK(B) receptor antagonist L365260, indicating a role for CCK(B) receptors. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that CCK8S produced a slow inward current associated with a decreased conductance with a reversal potential near the K(+) equilibrium potential. In addition, intracellular cesium also blocked the inward current, suggesting the involvement of a K(+) conductance, likely K(leak). Our data indicate that CCK, acting via CCK(B) receptors, produces a long-lasting excitation of layer 6b neocortical neurons, and this action may play a critical role in modulation of corticothalamic circuit activity.",

Nonadherence was defined as not taking medication as prescribed based on daily pill counts. Because there was no significant difference in nonadherence between dose groups, effects of nonadherence on efficacy and safety outcomes were examined using all 3 groups combined. Baseline demographics and symptom severity were investigated as potential risk factors for nonadherence.", 
    "70": "During the 8-week study, 34.5% of patients were nonadherent at least once. Nonadherent patients had significantly less improvement compared to adherent patients as measured by change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score (-22.57 vs. -26.84, p = .002). Longer duration of nonadherence was associated with reduced likelihood of treatment response (odds ratio = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90 to 0.99, p = .008). The early treatment discontinuation rate was higher in nonadherent compared to adherent patients (40.8% vs. 24.5%, p < .001). Adherent and nonadherent patients had comparable outcomes in most safety measures, except for weight change, for which adherent patients had greater weight gain than nonadherent patients (2.63 kg vs. 1.96 kg, p = .02).

In addition, the heart rates (HR), respiratory rates (RR) and rectal temperatures (RT) were determined immediately after drug administration and at 10 minute intervals over a period of 60 minutes. Analgesia was assessed by the response of the pigs to artery forceps applied at the interdigital space. Recovery was determined as pigs' ability to stand without ataxia. Data were expressed as mean +/- SEM while anaesthetic indices were compared using Student's t-tests. A P value of 0.05 was accepted as significant in all cases. In this study, both the OAN and RCT were significantly (P < 0.05) shorter in K10XM (1.4 +/- 0.2 min; 7.8 +/- 2.2 min) than in K20XM (2.2 +/- 0.2; 18.6 +/- 1.4 min) respectively. Similarly, the duration of anaesthesia was significantly (P < 0.05) shorter in K10XM (55.4 +/- 8.4 min) than in K20XM (92.0 +/- 13.6 min). The pigs that received K20XM combination had analgesia of duration of 41.4 +/- 12.6 min while those that received K10XM combination had no analgesia. However, the HR, RR, and RT were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between K10XM and K20XM. It was therefore concluded that the lower dose ketamine combination is better for the induction of anaesthesia, while the higher dose ketamine combination is preferable for surgery of short duration in pigs.", 
    "78": "Pregnancy and the postpartum are times of increased risk for women with bipolar disorder to develop mood episodes, especially depressions that may require pharmacotherapy. If mood stabilizing agents are discontinued prior or due to pregnancy, the risk for relapse increases dramatically. On the other hand, there is no psychotropic drug that is completely risk-free for the unborn. Some mood stabilizing medications are teratogenic, others can cause severe perinatal complications. Thus, the decision whether to treat the pregnant women with psychotropic drugs is difficult to make. In this paper, the reproductive risks of mood stabilizing agents, antidepressants, neuroleptics and benzodiazepines for the fetus are reviewed. During the postpartum period severe mood disorders can occur. The signs and symptoms of these disorders are reviewed and therapeutic strategies are discussed.", 
    "79": "Substance use disorders (SUD) include substance abuse and dependence as well as acute intoxication, withdrawal, and various psychiatric disorders. In the course of the SUD, severe comorbid disorders and somatic consequences can occur. The treatment of withdrawal symptoms focuses on the relief of immediate symptoms and the prevention of complications. The treatment of SUDs should achieve long-term abstinence with relapse prevention or harm reduction using maintenance treatment strategies. Beside psychosocial interventions, the pharmacotherapy has become an important factor for the treatment of SUDs and withdrawal syndromes. This review reports evidence-based pharmacologic treatment strategies of the most frequent SUDs according to current guidelines for SUDs. In the pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence long-lasting benzodiazepines or clomethiazole for alcohol withdrawal, and acamprosate or naltrexone for relapse prevention are preferable. There exists no effective relapse prevention for cannabis dependence. During cocaine withdrawal tricyclic antidepressants demonstrated the highest efficacy. For cocaine dependence no medication can be recommended, so far. However, mood stabilizers such as topiramate and tiagabine or disulfirame were found to be efficacious in preliminary studies. There is consistent evidence for methylphenidate in treating cocaine dependence co-occurring with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. For opioid dependence, methadone or buphrenorphine treatment is the pharmacotherapy of first choice. Nicotine replacement therapy, Bupropion and Vareniclin are efficacious in smoking cessation.", 
    "80": "The prevalence of insomnia is high in the population of western industrial countries (up to 35 %). Sleep disturbance may consequently lead to an impairment of cognitive functions, mood disturbance and metabolic alterations. Therefore, the confirmation of insomnia and its diagnostic characterization is of great importance. Treatment of insomnia is based on its aetiology and intensity. For secondary insomnia treatment of the basic disorder is mandatory. Before the initiation of a symptomatic pharmacological treatment the application of non-pharmacological interventions should be considered. Efficacious pharmacological interventions are non-benzodiazepine hypnotics for a limited time span. If a longer treatment of insomnia is necessary, hypnotic antidepressants and hypnotic neuroleptics (without anti-cholinergic action) can be applied taking the specific side effects into account. Classical benzodiazepines and substances with anti-cholinergic properties should be avoided in particular in long-term treatment and in elderly subjects due to its side effect profile.", 
    "81": "Anxiety disorders are persistent impairing diseases, with often chronic course and suffering from symptoms throughout a life-span. The medication with the most evidence of efficacy is the benzodiazepines having a low incidence of side effects but may cause physical dependence, withdrawal and sedation. The use of these drugs should be limited to the acute treatments during the first several weeks in combination with an SSRI or and SNRI for the treatment of the acute phase. After three to four weeks, when antidepressants become effective, benzodiazepine dose should be tapered over a one week period. Among the antidepressants, the SSRI and the SNRI are considered a first-line therapy because of their favourable side effect spectrum compared to tricyclic antidepressants. However, the association with side effects such as nausea, sweating, sexual dysfunction and gastrointestinal problems and insomnia may be intolerable for a number of patients. Combining antidepressants and benzodiazepine therapy or medication treatment and psychotherapy may lead to an increase in improvement in patients not responding to one treatment approach alone. The most effective treatment for managing the recurrent symptoms of this chronic disorder are still unknown and other studies and approaches are in need as remission rates are still only about 40%.", 
    "82": "The negative motivational aspects of withdrawal include symptoms of both anxiety and depression, and emerge after termination of chronic drug use as well as after acute drug exposure. States of acute withdrawal are an inherent part of intermittent drug use in humans, but the contribution of acute withdrawal to the development of addiction has received limited systematic investigation, because of a lack of preclinical models for withdrawal states that emerge spontaneously after acute drug exposure. Here, we have characterized a spontaneous increase in the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex (ie, spontaneous withdrawal-potentiated startle) that emerges after acute morphine administration in rats, and compared the time course of startle potentiation and place conditioning. We find that startle potentiation seems to be related to a decrease in opiate receptor occupancy and reflects an anxiety-like state with a pharmacological profile similar to other signs of opiate withdrawal. Spontaneous startle potentiation emerges before the rewarding effects of morphine have subsided, even though naloxone administration after a single morphine exposure causes both startle potentiation and conditioned place aversion (CPA). These results show that negative emotional signs of withdrawal develop after just one exposure to morphine, and are likely a recurrent aspect of intermittent drug use that may contribute to the earliest adaptations underlying the development of addiction. Furthermore, the dissociation between spontaneous startle potentiation and CPA suggests anxiogenic and dysphoric manifestations of opiate withdrawal may be mediated by distinct neural mechanisms that are progressively engaged as withdrawal unfolds.", 
    "83": "Second-generation antipsychotics can cause lipid elevations at a greater rate than older typical antipsychotics. This risk may not be equivalent amongst the second-generation antipsychotics. We conducted a computerized, retrospective, nonrandomized, case-control analysis of 6331 patients receiving antipsychotics. For each patient, the first prescription for at least 60 continuous days for four antipsychotics [haloperidol (HALD), olanzapine (OLANZ), quetiapine (QUET), or risperidone (RISP)] was analyzed for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides (TGL). Mean HDL was lower during OLANZ treatment than with RISP (P = 0.03) or QUET (P = 0.001). TGL were higher during OLANZ (P = 0.0007) or QUET treatment (P = 0.006) than RISP. In dichotomous analyses, odds ratios on the percentage of participants having abnormal cholesterol (P = 0.0003), low-density lipoprotein (P = 0.001), or TGL (P = 0.0001) during medication were in the order: OLANZ > QUET > RISP > HALD. For HDL, the results were less robust but the percentage of participants were in the order: OLANZ>RISP = HALD = QUET. In treatment-emergent analyses of patients without lipid abnormalities during an unmedicated baseline period, there was a greater risk of developing new HDL abnormality with OLANZ than RISP (P<0.05). In conclusion, treatment with RISP or HALD was associated with a more favorable lipid profile than with OLANZ or QUET.",

In correlation plots, these pK(B) values correspond best to published binding data on native or recombinant M(2) receptors but not to those on M(1), M(3), M(4), and M(5) receptors, suggesting that muscarinic autoreceptors of both the rat and human neocortex belong to the M(2) subtype.

An erroneous diagnosis and incorrect treatment may lead to patient's death or violent behavior. A clinical picture resembling psychosis or delirium can be caused by stimulant overdosage or beginning alcoholic delirium. Inconsciousness may be caused by alcohol, benzodiazepine or opiate intoxication. Of these, a specific antidote is available for the latter two.

This increase is blocked by systemic administration of both telenzepine, a preferential M(1) receptor antagonist, and N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635), a 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptor antagonist. The present study sought to determine whether DA efflux in the mPFC induced by the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine is also mediated by M(1) receptor stimulation and, specifically, to determine whether these effects are mediated M(1) receptors in the mPFC through use of in vivo microdialysis in awake, freely moving Sprague-Dawley rats. Telenzepine (3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated clozapine- (20 mg/kg), olanzapine- (10 mg/kg), and risperidone- (1.0 mg/kg) induced increases in mPFC DA efflux. Local mPFC perfusion of NDMC, AC260584, clozapine, risperidone, or olanzapine (10-500 microM), significantly increased DA efflux in the mPFC. Local mPFC perfusion of telenzepine (0.1 microM) prevented increases in mPFC DA efflux induced by systemic administration of AC260584 (10 mg/kg), NDMC (20 mg/kg), and clozapine (10 mg/kg), but not by risperidone (1.0 mg/kg) or olanzapine (10 mg/kg). However, local mPFC perfusion of WAY-100635 (0.1 microM) prevented mPFC DA efflux induced by clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, but not by AC260584 or NDMC. These results suggest that the AC260584-, NDMC-, and clozapine-induced DA efflux in the mPFC is mediated directly by mPFC M(1) receptors.", 
    "92": "Combined effects of alprazolam (Alp), a member of benzodiazepine group of drugs and caffeine on human cell lines, HeLa and THP1 were investigated in this study. Alp mediated cytotoxicity was enhanced while caffeine was present. The cell death was confirmed by observing morphological changes, LDH assay and membrane anisotropic study. Also such combined effects induced elevated level of ROS and depletion of GSH. The mechanism of cell death induced by simultaneous treatment of Alp and caffeine was associated with the calcium-mediated activation of mu-calpain, release of lysosomal protease cathepsin B, activation of PARP and cleavage of caspase 3. Our results indicate that, Alp alone induces apoptosis in human cells but in the presence of caffeine it augments necrosis in a well-regulated pathway. Thus our observations strongly suggest that, alprazolam and caffeine together produce severe cytotoxicity in human cell lines.", 
    "93": "We propose a translational approach to the study of anorexia nervosa (AN) based on our human subject studies where there are characteristic elevations in 5-HT(1A) receptor binding, associated harm avoidance behaviors, reduced impulsivity, and comorbid anxiety disorders. Towards this goal, the hyponeophagia assay was implemented whereby food-deprived mice show increased latency to begin feeding in a novel, anxiogenic environment. The non-selective serotonin agonist, 5-MeODMT, potentiates feeding inhibition compared to the inhibition generated by the anxiogenic environment in a drug-by-environment interaction. Thus, using hyponeophagia in mice, it was possible to study the following key components of AN: anxiety; feeding inhibition; and a modulatory role of the serotonergic system. A major prediction of the proposed AN model is that 5-HT(1A) receptor activation is necessary for feeding inhibition. In support of this model, the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY100635, reverses the 5-MeODMT-dependent potentiation of feeding inhibition. Our findings hint at a mechanistic role for increased 5-HT(1A) receptor activation in restricting-type AN. Further implications for the interplay between anxiety and feeding inhibition in AN are discussed.",

Antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs are generally considered to be relatively safe when used during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Benzodiazepine drugs, used for anxiety or insomnia, have a small but significant risk of birth defects. Antidepressant drugs could be used as an alternative for treating anxiety and insomnia. Lithium and anticonvulsant drugs (with the exception of lamotrigine) should generally be avoided during pregnancy. Antipsychotic drugs can be substituted for mood stabilizers. Use of anticonvulsant drugs is compatible with breastfeeding. Psychotherapy is a potential alternative to medication for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, and insomnia. Untreated maternal psychiatric illness can have adverse effects on pregnancy outcome and infant well-being. Available treatments and their potential risks when used during pregnancy or lactation should be discussed in the context of the risks of not treating maternal psychiatric illness effectively.",

    "109": "A large body of evidence indicates that lithium, the prototype mood stabilizer in the treatment of bipolar disorder, has diverse neuroprotective and neurotrophic actions, and the actions are associated with its efficacy in treating bipolar disorder. It has been suggested that up-regulation of neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) may underlie these neuroplastic actions of the drug. Olanzapine, an atypical anti-psychotic drug, has been shown to be an effective mood stabilizer. Olanzapine also has neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions, and these actions may underlie the efficacy of the drug for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, the molecular mechanism by which the drug produces the neuroplastic actions is poorly understood. To understand a common molecular mechanism underlying the neuroplastic actions of lithium and olanzapine, we assessed the effect of 4-week lithium and olanzapine treatment on the levels of BDNF, Bcl-2 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor involved in expression of BDNF and Bcl-2, in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal area CA1. Our results show that 4-week treatment with both olanzapine and lithium increases the levels of Bcl-2 and CREB in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal area CA1. Four-week lithium treatment up-regulates BDNF in the dentate gyrus, and 4-week olanzapine treatment marginally did so. Neither drug altered BDNF levels in area CA1. These results suggest that the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and CREB may underlie the neuroplastic actions of olanzapine and lithium.",

    "119": "Positive allosteric modulation of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) via the benzodiazepine recognition site is the mechanism whereby diverse chemical classes of therapeutic agents act to reduce anxiety, induce and maintain sleep, reduce seizures, and induce conscious sedation. The binding of such therapeutic agents to this allosteric modulatory site increases the affinity of GABA for the agonist recognition site. A major unanswered question, however, relates to how positive allosteric modulators dock in the 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site. In the present study, the X-ray structure of an acetylcholine binding protein from the snail Lymnea stagnalis and the results from site-directed affinity-labeling studies were used as the basis for modeling of the BZD binding pocket at the alpha(1)/gamma(2) subunit interface. A tethered BZD was introduced into the binding pocket, and molecular simulations were carried out to yield a set of candidate orientations of the BZD ligand in the binding pocket. Candidate orientations were refined based on known structure-activity and stereospecificity characteristics of BZDs and the impact of the alpha(1)H101R mutation. Results favor a model in which the BZD molecule is oriented such that the C5-phenyl substituent extends approximately parallel to the plane of the membrane rather than parallel to the ion channel. Application of this computational modeling strategy, which integrates site-directed affinity labeling with structure-activity knowledge to create a molecular model of the docking of active ligands in the binding pocket, may provide a basis for the design of more selective GABA(A)R modulators with enhanced therapeutic potential.",

Internal structure of the questionnaires was established by principal component analysis (PCA) in a sample of 155 respondents, and verified by confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in a second independent sample (n=139) using structural equation modeling. The PCA of the BRSEQ resulted in a 16-item, 4-factor scale, and the BEQ formed an 18-item, 2-factor scale. Both scales were internally reliable. CFA confirmed these internal structures and reduced the questionnaires to a 14-item self-efficacy scale and a 12-item expectancy scale. Lower self-efficacy and higher expectancy were moderately associated with higher scores on the SDS-B. The scales provide reliable measures for assessing benzodiazepine self-efficacy and expectancies.

The current paper addresses the marketing of olanzapine in detail based upon a review of these documents. All 358 documents released by Lilly are publicly available online. Documents were utilized for this review if they were relevant to the marketing of olanzapine in primary care settings in the United States. It was found that olanzapine was marketed off-label in primary care settings for relatively mild symptoms that were framed as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. A key strategy in this campaign was the use of hypothetical patient profiles in detailing visits, most of which clearly failed to meet diagnostic criteria for any recognized mental disorder. Evidence emerged that olanzapine was also marketed off-label as a treatment for dementia.", 
    "122": "Recent findings indicate that neurosteroids could act as important modulators during brain development. The aim of the present work is to screen whether developmentally altered AlloP levels may have long-lasting effects on behaviour and influence the emotional response to several GABA(A) receptor modulating drugs in adulthood. Acute allopregnanolone administration (10mg/kg) in the fifth postnatal day: (1) provoked long-term effects, as an increase of the novelty-directed locomotor activity and a decrease of its habituation in the open field in adult rats; (2) altered GABA(A) receptor response in adulthood, as reflected by the disruption of the effects of midazolam (1mg/kg) and flumazenil (10mg/kg) on the locomotor habituation in adulthood. Whereas the behavioural responses to 0.75 mg/kg of lorazepam or 3mg/kg of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) were not affected, although lorazepam decreased locomotor activity in both neonatal AlloP and control rats, probably related to the sedative properties of the dose tested. Also, in the elevated plus-maze, the anxiolytic effects of lorazepam were observed in controls, but not in neonatal allopregnanolone-treated rats. This suggests that neonatal allopregnanolone decreases sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of lorazepam at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Results suggest that alterations in neonatal allopregnanolone could result in an altered GABA(A) receptor response in adulthood that is evident behaviourally. These results point out the importance of the maturation of the endogenous neurosteroid mechanisms in the brain related to locomotor response to novelty and the responses to GABA(A) modulators in adulthood. This work opens future directions focused on the effects of acute and long-lasting neonatal alterations of AlloP levels on vulnerability to psychopathology in adulthood.", 
    "123": "Bz-423 is a pro-apoptotic 1,4-benzodiazepine with therapeutic properties in murine models of lupus demonstrating selectivity for autoreactive lymphocytes. Bz-423 modulates the F(1)F(0)-ATPase, inducing the formation of superoxide within the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which then functions as a second messenger initiating apoptosis. In order to understand some of the features that contribute to the increased sensitivity of lymphocytes, we report the signaling pathway engaged by Bz-423 in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Ramos). Following the generation of superoxide, Bz-423-induced apoptosis requires the activation of Bax and Bak to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. Knockdown of the BH3-only proteins Bad, Bim, Bik, and Puma inhibits Bz-423 apoptosis, suggesting that these proteins serve as upstream sensors of the oxidant stress induced by Bz-423. Treatment with Bz-423 results in superoxide-dependent Mcl-1 degradation, implicating this protein as the link between Bz-423-induced superoxide and Bax and Bak activation. In contrast to fibroblasts, B cell death induced by Bz-423 is independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These results demonstrate that superoxide generated from the mitochondrial respiratory chain as a consequence of a respiratory transition can signal a specific apoptotic response that differs across cell types.",

Rats were pretreated by oral route (p.o.) with 3-ASP (10, 25 and 50mg/kg) before intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of PC (400mg/kg), PTZ (80 mg/kg) or KA (45 mg/kg). 3-ASP increased the latency to the seizure onset on PTZ and KA models. At the dose of 50mg/kg, 3-ASP avoided the death caused by PTZ and KA. 3-ASP (50mg/kg) abolished seizures and death induced by PC in rats. To investigate the antioxidant effect of 3-ASP on rats exposed to PC, the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Na(+)K(+)ATPase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) as well as the levels of reactive species (RS) and ascorbic acid (AA) were determined in brains of rats. 3-ASP protected against the increase in RS levels and CAT activity induced by PC in brains of rats. The decrease in the levels of AA and inhibition of Na(+)K(+)ATPase, SOD and AChE activities caused by PC were protected by 3-ASP.

Common treatment strategies for this syndrome included a slower titration of antidepressant and the addition of benzodiazepines. Conclusive evidence for the efficacy of these strategies is lacking. There was conflicting and inconclusive evidence as to whether the emergence of this syndrome had a predictive value on the response to treatment. It appears to be a separate syndrome from akathisia, but evidence for this assertion was limited. The effect of jitteriness/anxiety syndrome on suicide rates has not been evaluated.

Using nelfinavir as a model protease inhibitor, we have shown that this phenomenon can be reproduced in a representative non-human primate model, Macaca nemestrina (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 329:1016-1022, 2009). Nelfinavir is cleared from the body predominantly by CYP3A metabolism and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux. Therefore, using midazolam (MDZ) as a CYP3A probe and digoxin (DIG) as a P-gp probe, we determined the antepartum (73-118 days) and postpartum (61-130 days) in vivo intestinal and hepatic CYP3A or P-gp activity in the macaque. Although the systemic clearance of MDZ was significantly increased ( approximately 70%) during pregnancy after intra-arterial (IA) administration of the drug ((15)N-labeled MDZ; 40 microg/kg), pregnancy did not affect the oral clearance of the drug administered simultaneously (1 mg/kg p.o.) with the IA dose. In vitro studies in hepatic and intestinal S-9 fractions indicated no effect of pregnancy on CYP3A activity or protein expression in the small intestine or liver. In contrast, neither the oral (100 microg/kg) nor the IA (10 microg/kg) clearance of DIG was significantly altered by pregnancy, indicating no effect of pregnancy on P-gp activity. Assuming that MDZ and DIG are selective substrates of the macaque CYP3A enzymes and P-gp, respectively, these results suggest that factors other than increased CYP3A or P-gp activity contribute to the increased clearance of protease inhibitors during M. nemestrina pregnancy.",

An injection of diazepam immediately ameliorated catatonic symptoms and reduced widespread high amplitude slow EEG activities with right frontotemporal predominance. Compared with a SPECT study performed a week earlier, there was no abnormal right-sided anteriorly predominant cerebral hyperperfusion after injection of diazepam. While neither flumazenil- nor FDG-PET could be repeated, and with the caveat that generalized convulsions occurred initially and epilepsia partialis continua was present for two weeks starting on the 23rd day after illness onset, these findings suggest that in our case the presentation with catatonic stupor may be related to impairment of the cortical GABAergic inhibitory system.",

Finally, a previously uncharacterized A-T didomain from anthramycin biosynthesis in the thermophile S. refuinius was demonstrated to selectively activate 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid at 47 degrees C, providing biochemical evidence for a new aromatic beta-amino acid activating adenylation domain and the first functional analysis of the anthramycin biosynthetic gene cluster.", 
    "135": "Depolarizing and excitatory GABA actions are thought to be important in cortical development. We show here that GABA has no excitatory action on CA3 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from neonatal NKCC1(-/-) mice that lack the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter isoform 1. Strikingly, NKCC1(-/-) slices generated endogenous network events similar to giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), but, unlike in wild-type slices, the GDPs were not facilitated by the GABA(A) agonist isoguvacine or blocked by the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide. The developmental upregulation of the K-Cl cotransporter 2 (KCC2) was unperturbed, whereas the pharmacologically isolated glutamatergic network activity and the intrinsic excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons were enhanced in the NKCC1(-/-) hippocampus. Hence, developmental expression of KCC2, unsilencing of AMPA-type synapses, and early network events can take place in the absence of excitatory GABAergic signaling in the neonatal hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that genetic as well as pharmacologically induced loss of NKCC1-dependent excitatory actions of GABA results in a dramatic compensatory increase in the intrinsic excitability of glutamatergic neurons, pointing to powerful homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity in the developing hippocampal circuitry.",

Use of SSRIs was associated with a twofold risk for patient hypoactive sexual desire and with a higher impairment of reported erectile function. However, no difference in penile blood flow was observed. A very high risk (sevenfold) for delayed ejaculation (DE) was observed in SSRI users. Interestingly, the association with the mild, but not severe, form of DE was observed also in subjects using non-SSRI antidepressants (3.35 [1.48-7.59]; P < 0.005). Different life stressors and relational parameters were also associated with SSRI use. SSRI users reported less enjoyment with masturbation and decreased partner desire and climax. Conversely, a lack of significant association was observed among BDZ or non-SSRI antidepressant users and all the aforementioned life-stressors and relational parameters.",

Recent data suggest that exposure to midazolam in early life may cause long-term effects on brain function through stable epigenetic reprogramming. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the administration of midazolam to infant mice would affect their learning and memory in adulthood. 2. An open-field test was conducted before and then 3, 24, 48 and 72 h after administration of midazolam (50 mg/kg, i.p.) to infant mice. Saline control mice received an equal volume of saline i.p. 3 h before the open-field test. Total movements, total movement time, total movement distance and velocity were analysed. Novel object recognition (NOR), Morris water-maze and passive avoidance tests were performed when the treated mice grew to adulthood (105 days of age). 3. The results of open-field test showed that midazolam significantly reduced locomotor activity (total movements, total movement time, total movement distance and velocity) in infant mice 3 and 24 h after drug administration and that these effects had disappeared by 72 h after drug administration. The results of the water-maze, NOR and passive avoidance tests in adulthood (at 105 days of age) indicated that administration of midazolam in infancy had no long-term effects on the learning and memory behaviours of adult mice compared with the saline control. 4. Acute midazolam administration to infant mice affected spontaneous locomotor activity for approximately 2 days, but did not seem to have any significant impact on cognitive functioning that lasted into adulthood.",

    "154": "A simple, sensitive, and reproducible liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the quantification of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine in whole blood using dibenzepine as internal standard (IS). After acidic methanol-induced protein precipitation of the whole blood samples, olanzapine and IS were chromatographed on a reversed-phase Zorbax Extend-C(18)-column at pH 9.0. Quantification was performed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer employing electrospray ionization technique operating in multiple reaction monitoring and positive ion mode. Total chromatographic run time was 15 min, and calibration curve was linear over the concentration range of 0.005 to 0.50 mg/kg olanzapine in whole blood. The method was validated for selectivity, matrix interference, recovery, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation (LOQ), accuracy, precision, and stability. The absolute recovery obtained was 103% for olanzapine and 68% for IS. An LOQ of 0.005 mg/kg olanzapine in whole blood was achieved. Inter- and intraday precision were less than 11% within concentrations from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/kg, and the accuracy ranged from 85 to 115%. The method was subsequently applied to 27 authentic samples, of which 20 were postmortem blood samples, from forensic investigations.", 
    "155": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the myenteric plexus, and it regulates its own release acting via muscarinic autoreceptors. Adenosine released from stimulated myenteric neurons modulates ACh release preferentially via facilitatory A(2A) receptors. In this study, we investigated how muscarinic and adenosine receptors interplay to regulate ACh from the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus of the rat ileum. Blockade of the muscarinic M(2) receptor with 11-[[2-1[(diethylamino) methyl-1-piperidinyl]- acetyl]]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b][1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and atropine facilitated [3H]ACh release evoked by short stimulation trains (5 Hz, 200 pulses). Prolonging stimulus train length (>750 pulses) shifted muscarinic autoinhibition towards facilitatory M(3) receptors activation, as predicted by blockade with J104129 (a selective M(3) antagonist), 4-DAMP and atropine, whereas the selective M(2) antagonist, AF-DX 116, was without of effect. Blockade of A(2A) receptors with ZM 241385, inhibition of adenosine transport with dipyridamole, and inhibition of ecto-5'-nucleotidase with concanavalin A, all attenuated release inhibition caused by 4-DAMP. J104129 and 4-DAMP, but not AF-DX 116, decreased ( approximately 60%) evoked adenosine outflow (5 Hz, 3000 pulses). Oxotremorine (300 micromol L(-1)) facilitated the release of [3H]ACh (34 +/- 4%, n = 5) and adenosine (57 +/- 3%, n = 6) from stimulated myenteric neurons. 4-DAMP, dipyridamole and concanavalin A prevented oxotremorine-induced facilitation. ZM 241385 blocked oxotremorine facilitation of [3H]ACh release, but kept adenosine outflow unchanged. Thus, ACh modulates its own release from myenteric neurons by activating inhibitory M(2) and facilitatory M(3) autoreceptors. While the M(2) inhibition is prevalent during brief stimulation periods, muscarinic M(3) facilitation is highlighted during sustained nerve activity as it depends on extracellular adenosine accumulation leading to activation of facilitatory A(2A) receptors.",

In the 511 patients we found most commonly ST abnormalities (19%), QTc prolongation (13%), tall R- and/or S-waves (11%) and missing R progression (10%). ECG abnormalities were more common in males than in females (64 versus 54%, P < 0.05), and in patients with positive than negative urine findings for cannabis (68 versus 57%, P < 0.05).

Relapse definitions were based on changes in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score, Clinical Global Impression-Severity score and predefined Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive items. Economic implications of relapse outcomes were also calculated. A limitation of this study is that this was not a head-to-head comparison. In addition, patient-level data were lacking for the paliperidone ER and olanzapine studies.",

According to the olanzapine relapse definition, three quetiapine XR patients (3.2%) experienced a relapse compared with nine patients (4.0%) in the olanzapine study. An illustrative calculation of potential economic impact associated with these standardised relapse rates implied incremental expenditures ranging from 74.8 million pound sterling to 373.9 million pound sterling (2006 pound sterling) for paliperidone ER versus quetiapine XR treatment and no material difference with olanzapine.",

Because of subtle steric differences among BzR subtypes, the latter approach has proved much more successful. A biological screening within the class of indol-3-ylglyoxylamides 1-3 allowed us to identify compounds 1c and 2b as potential anxiolytic/nonsedative agents showing alpha(2) selective efficacy in vitro and anxioselective effects in vivo. According to molecular modeling studies, and consistently with SARs accumulated in the past decade, 5-NO(2)- and 5-H-indole derivatives would preferentially bind to BzR by placing the indole ring in the L(Di) and the L(2) receptor binding sites, respectively.",

In order to improve the quality and the acceptance by children of a midazolam anesthesia premedication, a new 0.2% (w/v) aqueous solution for oral administration has been prepared. The final formulation was obtained by the adjunction of a sweetener (sucralose), an aroma (orange aroma) and gamma-cyclodextrin to a citric acid solution of midazolam. The gamma-cyclodextrin forms an inclusion complex with the hydrophobic midazolam as evidenced using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (stoichiometry 1:1, K=283 M(-1)).

    "172": "An altered regulation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system in the CNS is consistently associated with anxiety and depression; several drugs used to treat CNS disorders modulate--usually in a negative manner--CRH turnover in the brain, and it can be postulated that their effectiveness may be at least in part related to their effects on CRH. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of two atypical antipsychotics also employed in the treatment of bipolar disorders, i.e. quetiapine (QTP) and olanzapine (OLZ), on CRH release from isolated rat brain regions. Acute rat hypothalamic and hippocampal explants were exposed for 1 h to plain medium or medium containing the test drugs, either under baseline conditions or after stimulation of CRH release by veratridine or 56 mM KCl. CRH immunoreactivity present in the incubation medium and in the tissues was assessed by radioimmunoassay. QTP 10 microM but not OLZ inhibited baseline CRH secretion from the hypothalamus; neither drug affected basal CRH release from the hippocampus. Both QTP and OLZ, 1 and 10 microM, inhibited veratridine- or K(+)-stimulated CRH release from the hypothalamus, whereas OLZ only, when given at 10 microM, was able to inhibit stimulated CRH release from the hippocampus. In conclusion, two widely used atypical antipsychotics, QTP and OLZ are able to acutely reduce the release of CRH from isolated rat hypothalami and hippocampi.",

    "184": "Medical examiners often receive cases with limited medical history. Sometimes the medical history received is slightly skewed, or even incorrect. Here we describe a case which was initially referred to the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office from a large community hospital as a case of zolpidem overdose. The deceased presented to the hospital with hypertension, elevated temperature, worsening bizarre behavior, and movement irregularities. While in the hospital, the decedent developed seizure-like activity and died approximately 15 hours after admission. A complete autopsy was performed and yielded no significant gross or histologic abnormalities. A full toxicologic analysis revealed therapeutic levels of citalopram and phenytoin. Zolpidem was not present. Further review of the decedent's medical history as well as information provided by the next of kin revealed that the deceased had been taking diazepam for several years but had recently been switched to alprazolam. The decedent had abruptly stopped taking the alprazolam approximately 4 days before admission when she ran out of the medication, after taking approximately 200 mg in a 6-day period. Given the inconsistent clinical presentation and the findings at autopsy, we suspect that she suffered from benzodiazepine withdrawal and not an overdose as initially reported. Although it is possible that the zolpidem, reportedly taken in the 12 hours before admission, masked the initial symptoms of withdrawal, the constellation of symptoms and signs at presentation are more consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal than of zolpidem overdose. In this report, we emphasize to the forensic community that one must maintain a high index of suspicion for alternative explanations if the initial report does not seem to fit the presentation or autopsy findings. This case illustrates that although it may take some extra time and effort, further investigation into clinical history can prove crucial to obtaining the correct cause of death and manner of death. This is only the second case within the English literature of death because of benzodiazepine withdrawal."
