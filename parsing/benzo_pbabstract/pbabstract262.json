Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, we investigated the effects of short- and long-term oral treatments with several psychotropics on type II nitric oxide synthase gene expression in the rat brain. With maprotiline and fluvoxamine, enzyme mRNA levels were higher after a 28 day treatment than after 1 and 4 day treatments. Zonisamide, carbamazepine and diazepam also increased mRNA, though differences in levels between 1, 4 and 28 day treatments were not significant. These results suggest that psychotropics modulate the gene expression of type-II nitric oxide synthase in the brain.", 
    "1": "Thiopental, propofol, and diazepam-ketamine were compared for evaluation of laryngeal function in dogs. There was no significant difference among the three protocols in time to observation of normal function after drug administration or in the occurrence of swallowing, laryngospasm, or breathing. Jaw tone was significantly greater with diazepam-ketamine. Exposure of the larynx was excellent in five dogs and moderate in three dogs, each receiving thiopental or propofol. Exposure was excellent in one dog, moderate in six dogs, and poor in one dog receiving diazepam-ketamine. Exposure of the larynx for laryngeal function evaluation is more readily accomplished with thiopental or propofol than with diazepam-ketamine.", 
    "2": "To compare the anxiolysis property of zopiclone (ZPC) and midazolam (MDZ), 117 patients were given zopiclone 7.5 mg p.o. or midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 i.m. as premedication. In the study 1, patients were randomly allocated to 4 groups: ZZ group (n = 16) received ZPC in the night before operation and 2 h before operation, ZM group (n = 18) received ZPC in the night before operation and MDZ 1 h before operation, Z group (n = 18) received ZPC 2 h before operation, and M group (n = 24) received MDZ 1 h before operation. The degree of anxiety was evaluated using the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) on the day before operation and after receiving premedication. ZPC showed a significant reduction in the STAI score in the ZZ and Z group, but premedication with MDZ showed no changes in the STAI score. In the study 2, patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups: ZPC group (n = 22) received ZPC 2 h before operation, and M group (n = 19) received MDZ 1 h before operation. The degree of anxiety was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) on the day before operation and after receiving premedication. ZPC showed a significant reduction in the VAS score, but MDZ showed no changes in the VAS. It is concluded that ZPC (7.5 mg p.o.) is suitable to reduce the preoperative anxiety in patients who are to undergo surgery as compared to MDZ (0.05 mg.kg-1 i.m.).", 
    "3": "Hyperekplexia is primarily an autosomal dominant disease characterized by exaggerated startle reflex and neonatal hypertonia. It can be associated with, if untreated, sudden infant death from apnea or aspiration pneumonia and serious injuries and loss of ambulation from frequent falls. Different mutations in the alpha1 subunit of inhibitory glycine receptor (GLRA1) gene have been identified in many affected families. The most common mutation is Arg271 reported in at least 12 independent families. These mutations uncouple the ligand binding and chloride channel function of inhibitory glycine receptor and result in increased excitability in pontomedullary reticular neurons and abnormal spinal reciprocal inhibition. Three mouse models from spontaneous mutations in GLRA1 and beta subunit of inhibitory glycine receptor (GLRB) genes and two transgenic mouse models are valuable for the study of the pathophysiology and the genotype-phenotype correlation of the disease. The disease caused by mutation in GLRB in mice supports the notion that human hyperekplexia with no detectable mutations in GLRA1 may harbor mutations in GLRB. Clonazepam, a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, is highly effective and is the drug of choice. It enhances the GABA-gated chloride channel function and presumably compensates for the defective glycine-gated chloride channel in hyperekplexia. Recognition of the disease will lead to appropriate treatment and genetic counseling.", 
    "4": "The drug-drug interaction between oral anticoagulants (especially warfarin) and acetaminophen has been described, but evidence is conflicting and evidence for a similar interaction between acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon and acetaminophen is limited. Therefore, a study was performed to determine the influence of acetaminophen on oral anticoagulation with acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon in everyday practice.",

    "8": "Recent studies suggest that novel antipsychotics have positive effects on certain cognitive functions in schizophrenia. The present study investigated this claim by means of saccadic paradigms, which provide a selective index of cognitive function. Thirty-three first-episode schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to either olanzapine or risperidone treatment and compared with healthy control subjects for three saccadic paradigms. The influence of symptom profile, extrapyramidal symptoms, age, education, gender, hospitalization, and medication dose on cognitive performance was also investigated. Although the two patient groups did not differ from each other in task performance, both patient groups showed substantial problems in inhibitory control of saccades. A high level of education appeared to be protective for this impairment.", 
    "9": "ACh release from the rat frontal cortex was increased by both local, 0.1-1 microM, and systemic, 0.1-10 microg/kg, administration of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist ondansetron, reaching a maximum peak of 143% over basal values. Bicuculline, 1-10 microM, and flumazenil, 5-10 mg/kg, antagonists at different sites of the GABA(A) receptor, also enhanced ACh release, with maximum effects of 85 and 124% above baseline, respectively. GABA(A) receptor antagonists potentiated the effect induced by ondansetron on ACh release, reaching a peak increase of 238% (with bicuculline) and 259% (with flumazenil) over basal levels. These results suggest an interaction of ondansetron with GABAergic neurons modulating ACh release in the rat frontal cortex in vivo.", 
    "10": "Swimming behaviors in the forced swimming test have been reported to be depressed by stressors. Since toxic convulsion-inducing drugs related to dopamine [cocaine (COC)], benzodiazepine [methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-carboxylate (DMCM)], gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [bicuculline (BIC)], and glutamate [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)] receptors can function as stressors, the present study compared their effects on the forced swimming behaviors with the effects of immobilization stress (IM) in rats. Their interactions with ethanol (EtOH), the most frequently coabused drug with COC which also induces convulsions as withdrawal symptoms but interferes with the convulsions caused by other drugs, were also investigated.", 
    "11": "Similar to the IM (10 min) group, depressed swimming behaviors (attenuated time until immobility and activity counts) were observed in the BIC (5 mg/kg IP) and DMCM (10 mg/kg IP) groups at the 5 h time point, after which no toxic behavioral symptoms were observed. However, they were normalized to the control levels at the 12 h point, with or without EtOH (1.5 g/kg IP). In the COC (60 mg/kg IP) and NMDA (200 mg/kg IP) groups, the depression occurred late (12 h point), and was normalized by the EtOH cotreatment. At the 5 h point, the COC treatment enhanced the swimming behaviors above the control level.", 
    "12": "Although the physiological stress (IM), BIC, and DMCM also depressed the swimming behaviors, a delayed occurrence and EtOH-induced recovery of depressed swimming were observed only in the COC and NMDA groups. This might be correlated with the previously-reported delayed responses of DA and NMDA neurons rather than direct effects of the drugs, which could be suppressed by EtOH. Furthermore, the characteristic psychostimulant effects of COC seemed to be correlated with an early enhancement of swimming behaviors.", 
    "13": "A 59-year-old man, who was diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease and depression seven years ago and was on oral antiparkinsonian agents, antianxiety agents, and antidepressants, developed a high fever, disturbed consciousness, and marked muscle rigidity after discontinuation of etizolam and amitriptyline. He was admitted to a nearby hospital. Hypothyroidism had been noted two months before admission. Marked muscle rigidity and increased serum CK were observed. Since discontinuation of benzodiazepine has been known to rarely trigger a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), he was diagnosed as having NMS. After receiving dantrolene and bromocriptine, these symptoms temporarily improved but he again developed consciousness disturbance, and convulsive seizures associated with an elevated serum CK. He was transferred to our hospital. On admission, the CK level was normal at 168 IU/l, while free T4 was 0.6 ng/dl (normal range, 0.9-2.3) and TSH was 108.7 mU/ml (normal range, 0.2-4.2) in serum, indicating the presence of primary hypothyroidism. As an increase in thyroid hormone dosage improved the thyroid function to normal level, his disturbed consciousness and muscle rigidity gradually improved. Convulsive seizure and recurrence of NMS in a short interval are unusual in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In this patient, hypothyroidism may have contributed to the development of malignant syndrome through metabolic changes of the central dopaminergic system, and discontinuation of etizolam, a kind of benzodiazepine, may have triggered NMS, since there has not been reported that discontinuation of antidepressants including amitriptyline triggers NMS.", 
    "14": "There are some reports that classical neuroleptics may lead to osteoporosis or reduced bone mineral density (BMD). However, there is no adequate information about the effects of atypical neuroleptics on BMD. The aim of this study was to measure BMD in schizophrenic patients taking classical and atypical neuroleptics, compared to healthy controls. Seventy-five patients with schizophrenia (40 taking classical neuroleptics [CN], 35 taking atypical neuroleptics [AN]) and 20 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. Spine (L1-L4) BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. ANOVA showed that BMD was higher in HC than AN and CN. In addition, there was a negative correlation between the duration of neuroleptic treatment and BMD and the duration of the illness. These findings suggest that atypical neuroleptics may be safer than the classical neuroleptics in terms of reduced BMD.", 
    "15": "Neurolathyrism, an upper motor neuron disease, has been thought to be caused by long-term dietary consumption of lathyrus pulse, which contains the toxin beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid. Earlier behavioural studies employing oral feeding of lathyrus pulse to animals has been conducted without evaluating the biochemical toxicity potential. In the present investigation the effect of dietary feeding of 10%, 50% and 80% lathyrus pulse to rats and guinea pigs for 3 months on neurobehavioural parameters, including locomotor activity, inclined plain test and neurotoxicological parameters such as neurotransmitter receptor binding, Ca(2+) influx and membrane fluidity, was investigated. Exposure of 50% low and high toxin lathyrus to rats did not cause any significant change in locomotor activity, whereas guinea pigs at the same dosage regimen of high toxin lathyrus showed significant lowering of inclined plain test scores. Furthermore, studies of neuroreceptor binding in rats fed 50% low and high toxin lathyrus showed significant changes in glutamate, dopamine and muscarinic receptors, whereas the benzodiazepine receptor elicited no change. Guinea pigs, on the other hand, fed 50% and 80% lathyrus in the diet showed significant changes in glutamate, dopamine, muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. Interestingly, significant elevation in intracellular calcium with a concomitant increase in membrane fluidity was observed in rats (50% low and high toxin) and guinea pigs (50% and 80%) fed a lathyrus diet. These results indicate that although both species (rats and guinea pigs) are susceptible to neurochemical changes on exposure to lathyrus, locomotor changes are only noticed in guinea pigs. Thus, guinea pigs may be more prone to lathyrus toxicity and may serve as a sensitive animal model compared with rats.", 
    "16": "Lorazepam has been found to consistently impair performance on both episodic and perceptual priming tasks, whereas other benzodiazepines have shown perceptual priming to be preserved. However, it has recently been postulated that benzodiazepines may exert time-dependent effects on implicit memory processes after research findings indicated some benzodiazepines, other than lorazepam, impair performance on priming tasks when tested at the time of peak plasma concentration level after benzodiazepine administration.", 
    "17": "To compare time-dependent effects of lorazepam and oxazepam on implicit memory tasks, specifically perceptual priming and procedural learning.", 
    "18": "Thirty-three healthy female undergraduates were randomised to one of three time groups (pre-peak, peak, post-peak) and administered placebo, 2.5 mg lorazepam, and 30 mg oxazepam, in counterbalanced order, at 1-week intervals. Assessments included word-stem completion (perceptual priming) and rotary pursuit (procedural learning) tasks.", 
    "19": "At all time intervals, lorazepam but not oxazepam significantly impaired perceptual priming but procedural learning was preserved under both drugs.", 
    "20": "These findings are consistent with previous research showing a differential effect of lorazepam in impairing perceptual memory but the notion that benzodiazepines exert time-dependent effects on implicit memory processes was not supported.", 
    "21": "The effect of anesthetic drugs at central synapses can be described quantitatively by developing kinetic models of ligand-gated ion channels. Experiments have shown that the hypnotic propofol and the sedative benzodiazepine midazolam have similar effects on single inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) but very different effects on slow desensitization that are not revealed by examining single responses. Synchronous oscillatory activity in networks of interneurons connected by inhibitory synapses has been implicated in many hippocampal functions, and differences in the kinetics of the GABAergic response observed with anesthetics can affect this activity. Thus we have examined the effect of propofol and midazolam-enhanced IPSPs using mathematical models of self-inhibited one- and two-cell inhibitory networks. A detailed kinetic model of the GABA(A) channel incorporating receptor desensitization is used at synapses in our models. The most dramatic effect of propofol is the modulation of slow desensitization. This is only revealed when the network is driven at frequencies that are thought to be relevant to cognitive tasks performed in the hippocampus. The level of desensitization at synapses with propofol is significantly reduced compared to control synapses. In contrast, midazolam increases macroscopic desensitization at network synapses by altering receptor affinity without concurrently modifying desensitization rates. These differences in gating between the two drugs are shown to alter network activity in stereotypically different ways. Specifically, propofol dramatically increases the amount of excitatory drive necessary for synchronized behavior relative to control, which is not the case for midazolam. Moreover, the range of parameters for which synchrony occurs is larger for propofol but smaller for midazolam, relative to control. This is an important first step in linking alterations in channel kinetics with behavioral changes.", 
    "22": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates an abnormal aspect of the temporo-polar region in 1/3 to 2/3 of patients suffering from cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy. This abnormal aspect is described as a white matter increased T2 signal, resulting in a loss of gray-white matter demarcation, often associated with atrophy, as recently confirmed by quantitative volumetric measurements. These temporo-polar MRI findings appear to correctly lateralize the epileptogenic temporal lobe with a very high specificity, and have never been reported in extra-temporal lobe epilepsy nor in control subjects. They are usually associated with MRI signs of hippocampal sclerosis, but the two conditions seem to be partly distinct from a pathophysiological point of view. Pathological correlates of temporo-polar white matter increased T2 signal are controversial, but the role of an abnormal myelin seems more likely than that of ectopic neurons. A myelin dysfunction would also be consistent with the correlation observed between lateral temporal hypometabolism and temporo-polar MRI abnormalities. Whether or not these MRI findings are associated with a better seizure outcome following temporal lobectomy remains a debated issue.", 
    "23": "Considering that status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality, there are surprisingly few evidence-based data to guide management decisions. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the incidence and classification of SE and to summarise the recent developments in the treatment of generalized tonic clonic status epilepticus (GTCSE). These consist in two prospective randomised studies indicating that SE should be treated as soon as possible, even out-of hospital, by intravenous (IV) benzodiazepine. Lorazepam is probably the best choice for the initial therapy. However, the differences in efficacy as compared to diazepam, diazepam associated to phenytoin or phenobarbital were not significant. There is no Class I evidence to help us choose which drug to give in SE that is not responsive to the initial lorazepam. Traditionally, based on a long clinical experience, IV phenytoin is given as the second drug. Recently, phenytoin is being increasingly substituted by fosphenytoin, even though no formal, comparative tolerability studies have been performed to study this compound in GTCSE. Starting in the 1980's, the use of injectable valproic acid (IV VPA) has been reported in an increasing number of uncontrolled case series initiated by doctors, indicating relative easy use, relative good tolerability and suggesting that it may be efficacious. Finally, we have very little data concerning the treatment of SE refractory to a benzodiazepine and phenytoin. Despite this lack of data many centres today use midazolam or propofol rather than phenobarbital or pentobarbital in this setting because these compounds have short half-lives and are, therefore, easier to handle.", 
    "24": "This review is designed to describe the evolution of the seminal observation made simultaneously in 1975 by Dr. W. Haefely's laboratory (Hoffman La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and in the Laboratory of Preclinical Pharmacology (NIH, St. Elizabeths Hospital, Washington DC), that benzodiazepine action was mediated by a modulation of GABA action at GABA(A) receptors. In fact, our suggestion was that the benzodiazepine receptor was \"a receptor on a receptor\" and that this receptor was GABA(A). Needless to say, this suggestion created opposition, but we did not abandon the original idea, in fact, as shown in this review, there is now universal agreement with our hypothesis on the mode of action of benzodiazepines. Hence, this review deals with the allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors by benzodiazepines, the role of GABA(A) receptors and benzodiazepine structure diversities in this modulation, and describes the results of our attempts to establish a benzodiazepine (imidazenil) devoid of tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and changes in the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits during tolerance. It also deals with the idea that the synthesis of GABA(A) receptor subunits triggered by tolerance resides in dendrites and spines where mRNAs and the apparatus for this translation is located. New analytic procedures may foster progress in the understanding of tolerance to and withdrawal from benzodiazepines.",

    "26": "The object of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the Neogen Corp. microtiter plate enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) for opiates and benzodiazepines for screening of postmortem blood. Ninety postmortem whole blood specimens were obtained from drug-involved deaths which had been screened and confirmed positive for opiates and/or benzodiazepines. Forty negative specimens were obtained from non-opiate-involved deaths. Specimens were tested using the Neogen Opiates Group and Neogen Benzodiazepines Group microtiter plate ELISA assays. No matrix effects were found for whole blood in these assays and a dilution of 1:5 was chosen to facilitate pipetting and to bring the IC50 of the microtiter plate ELISA assay within the range of opiates and benzodiazepines encountered in medical examiner specimens. True positive, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives were determined and graphed for the ELISA results against gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection and case histories. From these graphs and the ROC curves, the optimal cut-off for the Neogen Opiates Group ELISA was found to be between 20 and 50 ng/mL morphine equivalents and the optimum cut-off for the Neogen Benzodiazepines Group ELISA was between 20 and 50 ng/mL temazepam equivalents. The Neogen Opiates Group ELISA had a sensitivity of 95.2% +/- 2.7% and a specificity of 92.2% +/- 3.4% versus GC-MS at a cut-off of 20-ng/mL cut-off and a sensitivity of 88.8% +/- 3.9% and specificity of 96.8% +/- 2.1% versus GC-MS at a 50-ng/mL morphine equivalents cut-off. The Neogen Benzodizepines Group ELISA had a sensitivity of 100% +/- 1.3% and a specificity of 94.6% +/- 2.9% versus GC-MS (20-ng/mL temazepam equivalents cut-off) and a sensitivity of 95.8% +/- 2.5% and specificity of 98.2% +/- 1.8% versus GC-MS at a 50-ng/mL cut-off.", 
    "27": "We evaluated the performance of the Roche OnTrak Testcup-er (TC-er), an on-site drug-testing device, for the detection of amphetamines (AMP), barbiturates (BRB), benzodiazepines (BNZ), benzoylecgonine (BE), and opiates (OPI) in urine specimens from hospital emergency departments. This device utilizes a competitive binding microparticle immunoassay to simultaneously determine the presence of the following drugs or drug classes in urine at and above the following cut-off concentrations: AMP, 1000 ng/mL; BRB, 200 ng/mL; BNZ 200 ng/mL; BE, 300 ng/mL; and OPI, 300 ng/mL. One hundred forty-nine urine specimens received from emergency departments were simultaneously tested by the EMIT II monoclonal immunoassay (Emit) and TC-er. Specimens yielding discordant results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was a 98% (146/149) agreement of results between the methods for the presence or absence of drugs. TC-er yielded 110 positive drug findings in 79 specimens, and Emit yielded 102 positive drug findings in 76 specimens. There was a 97% agreement between the methods for positive findings of at least one drug. The majority of discordant results were due to variations in selectivity of the assays for phenobarbital and BNZ metabolites. TC-er yielded a single false-positive result for amphetamines, and barbiturates, possibly three false-positive benzodiazepine results, and a single false-negative opiate finding. This represented four certain errors out of 745 total results, or a 0.4% error rate. If the three false-positive BNZ results were also considered, the error rate would be 0.9%. TC-er demonstrated acceptable linearity around the cut-off concentration of each drug. The TC-er was determined to be a reliable device for rapid on-site testing of emergency department urine specimens.", 
    "28": "The aim of this study was to develop a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method for the analysis of benzodiazepines in human hair. The method was tested by analyzing hair samples from forensic and clinical psychiatric patients where benzodiazepines had been prescribed during hospitalization and after care. Hair samples were obtained at discharge from the clinic and then after six months. Two-centimeter segments of the hair samples (10-30 mg) were washed once with isopropanol, three times with phosphate buffer, and again with isopropanol, dried, weighed, and digested with proteinase K before solid-phase extraction with BondElut Certify columns. Diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, OH-alprazolam, nitrazepam, 7-aminonitrazepam, flunitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, clonazepam, and 7-aminoclonazepam were quantitated in MRM mode using one transition for each analyte and deuterated internal standard. The calibration range was 0.125-5 ng/mg for diazepam, nordiazepam, and oxazepam and 0.025-1.0 ng/mg for the other compounds. In the hair samples analyzed, diazepam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, and clonazepam was detected together with their metabolites. Alprazolam was not detected in any sample. Segmental hair analysis revealed differences in drug deposition in hair before and after release from psychiatric treatment. Both increases and decreases of hair drug concentrations were seen after release even though the prescribed dose was the same. This was taken as an indication of noncompliance during the after-care period. We conclude that the extraction and LC-MS-MS procedures were adequate to detect benzodiazepines in hair and that the results indicated that segmental hair analysis might provide retrospective information about medication intake.", 
    "29": "The objective of this paper was to determine whether benzodiazepine clonazepam (CLO) and its major metabolite 7-aminoclonazepam (7-ACLO) could be detected in hair collected from healthy volunteers after receiving a single 3-mg dose of Klonopin (clonazepam). Such data would be of great importance to law enforcement agencies trying to determine the best time interval for hair collection from a victim of drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) in order to reveal drug use. Ten healthy volunteers (6 women and 4 men, 23-49 years old) participated in the study. The following hair samples were collected from each volunteer: one before CLO administration, and 1, 3, 5, 14, 21, and 28 days after. All hair samples were pulverized and 50-mg aliquots were sonicated in methanol and digested with 0.1 N HCl at 55 degrees C for 18-24 h. Internal standard, diazepam-d5 (DIAZ-d5) was used. Both extracts were combined and extracted using HCX solid-phase extraction columns. After derivatization with HFBA all extracts were analyzed using highly sensitive negative chemical ionization gas chrometography-mass spectrometry. Standard curves for CLO (20-100 pg/mg) and 7-ACLO (1-20 pg/mg) were prepared by spiking aliquots (50 mg) of negative hair and had correlation coefficients of 0.985 and 0.989, respectively. In addition, two levels of control hair were prepared for CLO and 7-ACLO. All method validation parameters were within acceptable limits. 7-ACLO was detected in hair of 6 out of 10 volunteers. In two cases 7-ACLO appeared in hair three days after CLO intake and remained detectable for the entire 28-day study period (3.6-8.4 pg/mg and 2.7-3.0 pg/mg), and in two subjects it was detectable 21 days later (4.9 and 2.7 pg/mg and 1.2 and 23 pg/mg). In two volunteers 7-ACLO was detected only on day 28 (1.8 and 3.3 pg/mg). CLO was not detected in any of the samples.", 
    "30": "Confirmed and alleged misuses of flunitrazepam (FM2, Rohypnol) have brought about serious interest in the development of an analytical methodology that can be effectively used for preliminary screen and confirmatory test of FM2 (or its metabolites) in urine specimens under high-volume settings. Reported methods do not serve this need well for the following reasons: (1) common benzodiazepine (BZ) immunoassays (IAs) have broad cross-reactivities toward widely prescribed BZs (and their metabolites) and are therefore likely to generate an unacceptable number of false positives and (2) because FM2 is typically used at low doses (1-4 mg), IAs with low cross-reactivities toward FM2 (and its metabolites) are likely to generate false-negative results. In this current study, a familiar and effective two-step IA/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approach is successfully developed and applied to clinical specimens. Cross-reacting characteristics of the following BZ IAs toward various BZs (and their metabolites) are evaluated focusing on their effectiveness in serving as the preliminary test reagent in a two-step testing protocol: TDx, Beckman, CEDIA, Roche Cobas Integra, Emit II Plus, and Cozart ELISA. Although other IAs show broad cross-reactivities toward various BZs and their metabolites, diazepam is the only non-FM2 derived compound that exhibits noticeable cross-reactivity toward Cozart ELISA reagent. Cross-reactivity data and data derived from studies conducted on a limited number of clinical specimens demonstrate that, when used to monitor FM2 exposure in a large population group (including those exposed to other BZs), Cozart ELISA has the potential of being as effective as (or better than) those currently used in various workplace drug-testing programs for monitoring respectively targeted drugs. Data derived from this study further suggest that 50 ng/mL apparent 7-aminoflunitrazepam (Cozart ELISA) and 30 ng/mL free 7-aminoflunitrazepam (GC-MS) are potentially effective preliminary test and confirmation test cut-offs. To maximize efficiency, it is further suggested that urine specimens are first diluted by a factor of 5 for the preliminary test in which a 10-ng/mL 7-aminoflunitrazepam standard is used as the assay's cut-off standard.", 
    "31": "The in vivo study aimed to examine whether muscarinic receptor subtypes other than muscarinic M3 receptors exert exocrine functional roles in the rat salivary glands. The effects of pirenzepine, methoctramine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) were examined on secretion from the major salivary glands evoked by acetylcholine (0.001-10 micromol kg(-1) i.v.) in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats. Observations were occasionally made on glandular blood flow. 4-DAMP (0.1-100 nmol kg(-1) i.v.) markedly and equipotently inhibited the acetylcholine-evoked fluid responses in all glands. Pirenzepine (0.1 micromol kg(-1) i.v.-10 mmol kg(-1) i.v.) showed significantly lower inhibitory potency than 4-DAMP, most conspicuously in the parotid, while methoctramine (0.1 micromol kg(-1) i.v.-10 mmol kg(-1) i.v.) exerted an even lesser inhibitory effect. Also against acetylcholine-evoked blood flow increases, 4-DAMP showed a conspicuous potency. At 1 and 10 micromol kg(-1) i.v. of pirenzepine, the antagonist reduced the protein concentration in the submandibular saliva, but not in the parotid saliva. While 4-DAMP (1 and 10 nmol kg(-1) i.v.) significantly inhibited acetylcholine-evoked protein secretory responses in the submandibular glands, methoctramine (below 10 micromol kg(-1) i.v.) affected the responses in neither gland. The reduction of the protein concentration in submandibular saliva caused by 4-DAMP and pirenzepine was inhibited by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 30 mg kg(-1) i.p.), while L-NAME had no or only minute effects on the parotid protein secretion. Thus, in addition to muscarinic M3 receptors, other muscarinic receptors contribute to in vivo functional responses in rat submandibular and sublingual glands. While these other receptors are muscarinic M1 receptors in the sublingual gland, they may be a different subtype, possibly muscarinic M5 receptors, in the submandibular gland. However, muscarinic M1 receptors may induce indirect effects via nitric oxide in the submandibular gland.", 
    "32": "Depression is an incapacitating disease which needs appropriate treatment. This article reviews the pharmacology of antidepressant drugs and the future perspectives of treating mood disorders such as depression. The foremost theory for explaining the biological basis of depression has been the monoamine hypothesis. Depression is due to a deficiency in one or other biogenic monoamines (serotonin, 5-HT; noradrenaline, NA; dopamine, DA). Antidepressant drugs are therefore classified according to their ability to improve monoaminergic transmission. Since this first theory, other explanations based on abnormal function of monoamine receptors or associated with impaired signalling pathways have been suggested. Notable progress has been accomplished in the treatment of major depressive disorders with new compounds recently discovered (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: SSRI; serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors: SNRI). Behavioural, electrophysiological and microdialysis studies have shown that serotonin (5-HT) receptors, mainly 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C sub-types, exert a key role in modulating antidepressant activity. Indirect activation of neurotransmitter receptors by antidepressants may also lead, via increases in endogenous levels of serotonin in synapses in specific brain regions, to activation of various G proteins coupled to a receptor, signal of transduction, transcription factors and neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Thus, depression may be considered as a transduction mechanism anomaly. This hypothesis needs to be clarified by molecular biology. Although antidepressants have improved the therapeutic potential compared to tricyclics (TCA) in terms of reduced side effects, a number of problems still occur with these drugs. Clinical effects are not always observed until after this time has elapsed (4-6 weeks) and a substantial proportion of depressed patients show only partial or no response to antidepressants. Knowledge of the existence of links between neurotransmitter systems and the discovery of the most specific target, 5-HT receptors, should lead to improvements in antidepressant therapy. Developing drugs using innovative mechanisms such as directly acting on 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A agonists or 5-HT2 antagonists), would appear to be useful in the treatment of depression. The use of antidepressants in anxiety disorders such as obsessional compulsive disorders and even generalised anxiety, highlights the distinction between antidepressants and classic anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines, or even buspirone.",

    "34": "This study was designed to investigate the overall usefulness of rectal thiopental, rectal midazolam and i.m. modified cocktail (meperidine-chlorpromazine hydrochloride-feniramin maleat) in 70 children undergoing computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).", 
    "35": "The dosage of thiopental was 50 mg per kg for infants under 6 months of age, 35 mg per kg between six and 12 months, and 25 mg per kg for older children. The maximal dose did not exceed 700 mg in this study. The dosage of midazolam was 1 mg per kg for all children. A modified cocktail was described as a formulation including 11 mg/mL of meperidine, 2.8 mg/mL of chlorpromazine and 2.8 mg/mL of pheniramine maleat. The dosage of modified cocktail was 0.1 mL per kg for all children.", 
    "36": "The mean induction time for the i.m. cocktail was significantly longer than that for rectal thiopental (P < 0.001). The mean duration of deep sedation was 60.79 +/- 27.00 min with rectal thiopental and 58.74 +/- 39.70 min with i.m. cocktail (P > 0.05). Although the mean duration of sleep for rectal thiopental and i.m. cocktail was similar, the mean discharge duration for i.m. cocktail was significantly longer than that for rectal thiopental (P < 0.05). Children sedated with the cocktail therapy also required a longer period of observation in the department. Significant decreases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation occurred in three groups (P < 0.001). Significant decreases in body temperature occurred after rectal thiopental and i.m. cocktail therapy (P < 0.01). The effect of rectal midazolam was minimal.", 
    "37": "Rectal thiopental may be the drug of choice for pediatric sedation because it has a more rapid onset and offset of action. It is also safe and effective at the dosage studied in children undergoing MRI. Rectal midazolam also may be used in children undergoing CT imaging because of minimal side-effects.", 
    "38": "The category of common sleep disorders known as parasomnias includes disorders of arousal, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), nocturnal seizures, rhythmic movement disorder, and tooth grinding or 'bruxism'. Parasomnias are all characterised as undesirable physical or behavioural phenomena occurring during the sleep period. Although these conditions can be distressing and, in some cases, hazardous to the sleeper and his or her bed partner, it is important to recognise that parasomnias are diagnosable and treatable in the vast majority of patients. Evaluation begins with a careful clinical interview with the sleeper and a family member to elucidate the frequency, duration, description and timing after sleep onset of these behavioural events. Disorders of arousal are the most common type of parasomnia and cover a spectrum from calm sleepwalking to emotionally agitated or complex behaviours, such as dressing or driving, for which the patient usually has no memory upon awaking. 'Sleep terrors' are quite common in young children and are often outgrown. Disorders of arousal represent a partial, as opposed to a full, awakening from deep non-REM sleep, typically occurring within the first 60 to 90 minutes after sleep onset. RBD is characterised clinically by a history of dream-enacting behaviour, and the patient may recall dream content. REM sleep periods typically occur in the latter half of the night. Physiologically, RBD results from a lack of the normal muscle atonia that is associated with REM sleep. RBD has been linked to a number of other neurological conditions; thus, a careful review of systems and a physical examination are crucial. A formal laboratory sleep study or polysomnogram with an expanded electroencephalographic montage can help distinguish among non-REM and REM parasomnias and nocturnal seizures. The latter may manifest clinically as arousals from sleep associated with vocalisation and/or complex behaviours. Rhythmic movement disorder can include head banging or body rocking at sleep onset or during the night. Tooth grinding is a common sleep-related behaviour that, when severe, can result in dental injury. Hypnagogic hallucinations (experience of dream imagery at sleep onset) and sleep-onset paralysis (experience of muscle/body paralysis as one is falling asleep) are symptoms rather than diagnostic categories. These phenomena classically occur in many individuals with narcolepsy, but also may occur in healthy sleep-deprived individuals. Safety precautions and good general sleep hygiene measures are recommended for individuals with a parasomnia, as the disorder can be exacerbated by sleep deprivation and various other factors. When the events are frequent or particularly dramatic, medication with a long- or medium-acting benzodiazepine, such as clonazepam, at bedtime is effective therapy in most cases of non-REM disorders of arousal and RBD. A dental guard may be helpful in tooth grinders. Relaxation training and guided imagery may be helpful strategies for some patients, especially those with disorders of arousal or rhythm movement disorders. There is no evidence of any association between parasomnias and psychiatric illness. Demystification of these conditions and reassurance, particularly for parents of paediatric patients, is an important aspect of clinical intervention.",

    "40": "Eleven patients with schizophrenia stabilized on oral olanzapine (mean dosage 12.7 mg daily [SD5.2]) were given an orally disintegrating olanzapine tablet, rather than their usual tablet, daily for 7 days. At each visit, visual assessments were made for elapsed time to initial disintegration (every 15 seconds) and complete disintegration (every 1 minute). At the end of the study, patients completed a drug-acceptance questionnaire.",

Antagonism of the effects of zolpidem was studied using the GABA(A)/alpha(1)-preferring antagonists beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCT) and 3-propyloxy-beta-carboline (3-PBC).", 
    "46": "Zolpidem and quazepam (GABA(A)/alpha(1)-preferring agonist) engendered full substitution for zolpidem, whereas CL 218,872 (GABA(A)/alpha(1)-preferring partial agonist) and the non-selective BZ agonists alprazolam and flunitrazepam engendered low and variable levels of zolpidem-lever responding (35-58%). Both beta-CCT and 3-PBC antagonized the discriminative stimulus effects of zolpidem in a surmountable fashion.", 
    "47": "Our findings provide evidence for a key role of GABA(A)/alpha(1) receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of zolpidem at relatively high training doses, and suggest that selectivity and relatively high efficacy at GABA(A)/alpha(1) receptors is required for BZ agonists to reproduce these discriminative stimulus effects.",

    "54": "Mice lacking the GABA(A) receptor beta(3) subunit exhibit a profound disruption in thalamic circuitry. We have studied sleep in these mice under baseline conditions and following treatment with the benzodiazepine midazolam. Under baseline conditions, NREM sleep time did not differ between beta(3) subunit knockout mice and wild type mice, while REM sleep time was significantly lower in knockout mice than in wild type mice during the light portion of a 24-h light-dark cycle. In constant dark conditions, circadian rhythmicity remained intact in mutant mice for a period of at least 9 days. EEG delta power (1-4 Hz) was significantly greater in the knockout than in wild type mice during NREM sleep but not during other states. A transient increase in EEG power in the 12-16 Hz range that occurred in wild type mice just prior to the transition from NREM to REM sleep was present but significantly blunted in the knockout. Midazolam decreased NREM delta power and REM time in wild type mice. The former but not the latter response to midazolam was intact in the knockout. These results further support a role for GABAergic transmission in regulating REM sleep and EEG spectral phenomena associated with NREM sleep.", 
    "55": "1. Preliminary studies have identified cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP1B1 as the human CYPs inhibited by tamoxifen. To quantify the inhibitory potency of tamoxifen and its major metabolites, the metabolism of three substrates of CYP3A, midazolam, diltiazem and testosterone, and 7-ethoxyresorufin as a substrate of CYP1B1 were examined in catalytic assays carried out using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expression systems. 2. Tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 3-hydroxytamoxifen reversibly inhibited midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, diltiazem N-demethylation and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation with K(i) ranging from 3 to 37 micro M in human liver microsomes. Tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 3-hydroxytamoxifen also reversibly inhibited the activity of cDNA-expressed CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP1B1. 3. Tamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen exhibited time-dependent inactivation of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation by cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 (+ cytochrome b5) yielding k(inact) and K(i) of 0.04 min(-1) and 0.2 micro M for tamoxifen and 0.08 min(-1) and 2.6 micro M for N-desmethyltamoxifen. A metabolic intermediate complex (MIC) was also formed by tamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen with CYP3A4 (+ cytochrome b5) and CYP3A4 but not with CYP3A5 or CYP3A7. Pre-incubation with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 3-hydroxytamoxifen did not result in any CYP3A inactivation or detectable MIC formation. There was no detectable time-dependent inactivation or MIC formation with tamoxifen or metabolites with CYP1B1. 4. These data indicate that tamoxifen and its three major metabolites are effective inhibitors of CYP3A in vitro and that tamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen are effective mechanism-based inhibitors. Thus, caution should be exercised when tamoxifen is coadministered with other CYP3A substrates.", 
    "56": "The newer antipsychotic agents exhibit a superior safety profile compared with conventional antipsychotic agents in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms. Previous studies have suggested an association between olanzapine treatment and hyperlipidemia. We evaluated this association using a large health care database.",

A total of 18 309 individuals diagnosed as having schizophrenia were identified. A 6:1 matched nested case-control design was used. Conditional logistic regression was used to derive adjusted odds ratios (ORs), controlling for sex, age, and other medications and disease conditions influencing lipid levels. Antipsychotic drug exposure was defined as the receipt of at least 1 prescription for an antipsychotic medication within the 3 months before the date of diagnosis of hyperlipidemia.",

    "60": "Seventy-five families of children with intractable epilepsy but without a severe learning disability (mean age 7 years 1 month, SD 2 years 6 months; range 2 to 12 years) who attended a regional paediatric neurology service, were surveyed. A postal questionnaire was used which included standardized measures of child and family adjustment; forty-eight families responded (64%; 31 males, 17 females). There was no significant difference between responders and non-responders in terms of age, sex, number of other chronic illnesses and disabilities, age at epilepsy diagnosis, seizure type, nor number of antiepileptic drugs currently prescribed (p > 0.05). The importance of including multidimensional measures of outcome was highlighted by the finding that epilepsy, pharmacological, and psychosocial factors were differentially associated with specific adjustment difficulties. Two factors appeared to be most pervasively implicated across a range of adjustment problems: frequency of rectal diazepam administration and family patterns of relating to each other (p < 0.05). It appeared that duration of seizures (as indicated by frequency of rectal diazepam administration), rather than the frequency of seizures per se, was more pernicious in terms of poor adjustment. Intrafamilial relations (degree of conflict/cohesion and soon) were not only associated with adjustment difficulties in the child, but also with the frequency of seizures themselves. Implications for psychological interventions in intractable epilepsy in childhood are highlighted.", 
    "61": "Status epilepticus is a medical emergency, if not treated in time and effectively may cause significant mortality and morbidity. Medical therapy has been the mainstay of treatment but in refractory status surgical resection, multiple subpial transection, electroconvulsive therapy, caudate stimulation and acupuncture play important role. The present operational definition for adults and older children considers status as > or = 5 minutes of continuous seizure or two or more discrete seizures without regaining of full consciousness. Status epilepticus accounts for 1-8% of all hospital admissions for epilepsy. Physiological changes in generalised convulsive status epilepticus include transient or early (0-30 minutes) and late (after 30 minutes) changes. Temporal changes occur as tonic-clonic status epilepticus progresses. Management can be considered in two ways--out hospital management and inpatient management. Benzodiazepine is considered 1st line of treatment outside hospital. Emergency/inpatient management includes basic life support (0-10 minutes) and pharmacological management (10-60 minutes). Drugs used in pharmacological management are lorazepam, midazolam, propofol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, i.v. valproate, rectal diazepam, etc. The classical definition of refractory status epilepticus includes seizure that has not responded to sequential treatment of lorazepam, phenytoin or phenobarbitone or seizure continuing > 60-90 in spite of adequate treatment.",

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), used to treat seizures in children, infants, and pregnant women, cause cognitive impairment, microcephaly, and birth defects. The cause of unwanted effects of therapy with AEDs is unknown. Here we reveal that phenytoin, phenobarbital, diazepam, clonazepam, vigabatrin, and valproate cause apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain at plasma concentrations relevant for seizure control in humans. Neuronal death is associated with reduced expression of neurotrophins and decreased concentrations of survival-promoting proteins in the brain. beta-Estradiol, which stimulates pathways that are activated by neurotrophins, ameliorates AED-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration. Our findings present one possible mechanism to explain cognitive impairment and reduced brain mass associated with prenatal or postnatal exposure of humans to antiepileptic therapy.", 
    "69": "M11L, an antiapoptotic protein essential for the virulence of the myxoma poxvirus, is targeted to mitochondria and prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential that accompanies cell death. In this study we show, using a cross-linking approach, that M11L physically associates with the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) component of the permeability transition (PT) pore. Close association of M11L and the PBR is also indicated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Stable expression of M11L prevents the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c induced by staurosporine or protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a ligand of the PBR. Transiently expressed M11L also prevents mitochondrial membrane potential loss induced by PPIX, or induced by staurosporine in combination with PK11195, another ligand of the PBR. Myxoma virus infection and the associated expression of early proteins, including M11L, protects cells from staurosporine- and Fas-mediated mitochondrial membrane potential loss and this effect is augmented by the presence of PBR. We conclude that M11L regulates the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, most likely by direct modulation of the PBR.",

Patients aged 65-80, with a diagnosis of dementia and probable VaD, received rivastigmine 3-6 mg/day (n=8) or cardioaspirin (n=8) in an open study for 22 months. At 22 months, patients treated with rivastigmine showed significant improvements in executive function and behavioural symptoms (both p<0.05 vs. both baseline and control group), which were reflected in reduced caregiver stress (p<0.05 vs. baseline and controls). Baseline scores of global response, cognition, word fluency and activities of daily living were maintained in patients receiving rivastigmine, and there was no increase in benzodiazepine or neuroleptic intake. In contrast, the control group showed no improvements in any domain, and significant deterioration in global response and executive function (both p<0.05 vs. baseline and rivastigmine group). Side effects in both groups were tolerable and there were no study withdrawals. Long-term rivastigmine treatment appeared to be safe and effective in this patient population. In particular, improvements in domains particularly relevant to this condition were observed. These benefits may reflect the drug's dual inhibitory effects on the cholinergic system, and its particular activity in frontal areas of the brain. A large, double-blind study of rivastigmine in patients with VaD would be worthwhile.",

Twenty patients with schizophrenia (according to DSM-III-R criteria) treated with either clozapine (100-600 mg/day) or olanzapine (10-20 mg/day), and ten healthy controls, were recruited into the study. PRV was assessed by continuously recording the skin blood volume in the fingertip of the second digit under resting conditions and PRV parameters were calculated. When significant differences in PRV parameters between the patients and controls were detected by Kruskal-Wallis tests, Mann-Whitney tests were used to test for group differences between the olanzapine- and clozapine-treated patients. In comparison to the healthy controls, the PRV parameters of the clozapine- and olanzapine-treated schizophrenic patients were significantly reduced. Indeed the reduction of PRV was significantly greater in the clozapine-treated group compared to the olanzapine-treated group (P<0.05). Compared to the controls, only the clozapine-treated patients showed a significantly diminished low-frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF)-ratio, a PRV parameter reflecting sympatho-vagal balance. The significantly greater reductions in PRV parameters of the clozapine-treated compared to olanzapine-treated patients may be caused by clozapine's higher affinity for alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors in vivo compared with olanzapine. The similar LF/HF ratios of the healthy controls and olanzapine-treated patients suggests that the sympathetic-parasympathetic modulation of PRV remains relatively unchanged even during olanzapine treatment.", 
    "85": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor mediates fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CNS. Dysfunction of the GABA(A) receptor would be expected to cause neuronal hyperexcitability, a phenomenon linked with epileptogenesis. We have investigated the functional consequences of an arginine-to-glutamine mutation at position 43 within the GABA(A) gamma(2)-subunit found in a family with childhood absence epilepsy and febrile seizures. Rapid-application experiments performed on receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells demonstrated that the mutation slows GABA(A) receptor deactivation and increases the rate of desensitization, resulting in an accumulation of desensitized receptors during repeated, short applications. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis of steady-state currents obtained from alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) or alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)(R43Q) receptors did not reveal any differences in GABA sensitivity. However, differences in the benzodiazepine pharmacology of mutant receptors were apparent. Mutant receptors expressed in oocytes displayed reduced sensitivity to diazepam and flunitrazepam but not the imidazopyridine zolpidem. These results provide evidence of impaired GABA(A) receptor function that could decrease the efficacy of transmission at inhibitory synapses, possibly generating a hyperexcitable neuronal state in thalamocortical networks of epileptic patients possessing the mutant subunit.", 
    "86": "Recent studies have shown that Hypericum perforatum extracts (HPE) inhibit ethanol intake in alcohol-preferring rats, but their mechanism of action is still unknown. HPE have been shown to bind at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) and GABA(B) receptors, to inhibit GABA reuptake, to evoke GABA release from synaptosomes and to exert an anxiolytic effect that is blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Since GABA-ergic mechanisms are known to influence ethanol intake, the present study was aimed at investigating whether they might mediate the effect of a CO2 Hypericum extract (HPCO2) on ethanol intake in genetically selected Marchigian Sardinian alcohol-preferring (msP) rats.", 
    "87": "The GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline and the GABA(B) receptor antagonists CGP-36742 and phaclofen were tested versus the effect of HPCO2 on ethanol intake.", 
    "88": "The results of the present study confirm that HPCO2, given by intragastric injection, markedly reduces ethanol intake in msP rats and its effect is behaviourally selective, since the same doses which inhibited ethanol intake did not modify the simultaneous intake of food or water. The GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline, given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a dose of 2 mg/kg, which effectively antagonizes the effects of GABA(A) receptor agonists, did not modify the effect of HPCO2, 15 or 125 mg/kg. The GABA(B) receptor antagonists CGP-36742, given by i.p. injection at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and phaclofen, given by intracerebroventricular injection at a dose of 25 micro g/rat, did not modify the inhibitory effect on alcohol intake induced by HPCO2, 15 or 125 mg/kg. The same doses of the two GABA(B) receptor antagonists induced a pronounced reduction of the effect of the GABA(B) receptor agonist bacoflen, given by i.p. injection at a dose of 5 mg/kg.", 
    "89": "These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of HPE on ethanol intake are not mediated by GABA agonist actions.", 
    "90": "Type A cholecystokinin receptor (CCKAR) antagonists differing in blood-brain barrier permeability were used to test the hypothesis that duodenal delivery of protein, carbohydrate, and fat produces satiety in part by an essential CCK action at CCKARs located peripheral to the blood-brain barrier. Fasted rats with open gastric fistulas received devazepide (1 mg/kg iv) or A-70104 (700 nmol. kg(-1). h(-1) iv) and either a 30-min intravenous infusion of CCK-8 (10 nmol. kg(-1). h(-1)) or duodenal infusion of peptone, maltose, or Intralipid beginning 10 min before 30-min access to 15% sucrose. Devazepide penetrates the blood-brain barrier; A-70104, the dicyclohexylammonium salt of Nalpha-3-quinolinoyl-d-Glu-N,N-dipentylamide, does not. CCK-8 inhibited sham feeding by approximately 50%, and both A-70104 and devazepide abolished this response. Duodenal infusion of each of the macronutrients dose dependently inhibited sham feeding. A-70104 and devazepide attenuated inhibitory responses to each macronutrient. Thus endogenous CCK appears to act in part at CCKARs peripheral to the blood-brain barrier to inhibit food intake.", 
    "91": "Separate sub-populations of benzodiazepine receptors are involved in determining hippocampal theta frequency in freely moving rats. Systemic injection of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) reduced the frequency of theta elicited by stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation, and theta recorded during fixed interval (FI) bar pressing. Infusion of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil into the supramammillary nucleus (mSuM) or the posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PH) antagonised CDP in both cases. Flumazenil was similarly effective in mSuM and PH, suggesting that these nuclei are jointly involved in the coding of theta frequency during FI and during high levels of reticular activation. However, benzodiazepine receptors in other brain regions probably participate in determining the frequency of theta at other times.", 
    "92": "The present study determined the pharmacological profile of barakol, a major constituent of Cassia siamea Lamk., in rodent behavioral and neurochemical tests. Barakol reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, increased the number of sleeping animals and prolonged the thiopental-induced sleeping time, indicating a sedative effect. As for interactions between barakol and convulsants (pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), picrotoxin, bicuculline and strychnine), only a high dose (100 mg/kg, i.p.) of barakol slightly prolonged the latency of clonic convulsion induced by picrotoxin. This suggests that the sedative effect may not be induced via the GABA or glycine systems. There was no evidence of an anxiolytic effect of barakol in the plus-maze test. However, barakol (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) could suppress methamphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced hyper-locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating an effect on the dopaminergic system. In a microdialysis study, the dose of barakol (100 mg/kg) that inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity in mice did not affect the basal levels of extracellular dopamine (DA) or its metabolites in the striatum. However, pretreatment with barakol (100 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the maximal dopamine release and dopamine turnover induced by methamphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.). This finding indicates that the inhibitory effect of barakol on dopamine release may account for the blocking effect of barakol on the striatum-related behavior induced by methamphetamine.", 
    "93": "A pilot study was conducted to examine if donepezil could enhance cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia. Fifteen subjects who were on stable olanzapine treatment were entered into a 6-week open-labeled trial of donepezil. Subjects received baseline and end-of-study P50 and neuropsychological assessments. Donepezil treatment resulted in significant improvement in manual dexterity. There were moderate improvements in verbal recall memory and visual memory and processing speed, with smaller changes in P50 and verbal recognition memory. There was no effect on an attention measure. There were no changes in either positive or negative symptoms. These results suggest that cholinergic tone modulation may enhance selective behavioral functions in patients with schizophrenia, but further study is required to delineate the full extent of the potential benefit of this approach.", 
    "94": "Information from the Ohio Department of Mental Health (ODMH) database was reviewed retrospectively to identify patients at the Cincinnati center treated with an atypical antipsychotic and who had also been evaluated or treated for diabetes mellitus. Blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, or other evaluations of diabetes had been conducted in 14 of the 126 patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. In 11 of the 14, new-onset, acute, and marked glucose intolerance developed after treatment with clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine. Of these, six patients required insulin therapy (four only transiently) and five patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Also, glucose metabolism was labile in all cases, and was transient in two cases with subsequent resolution despite on-going antipsychotic therapy. Certain atypical antipsychotics may be associated with new-onset glucose intolerance, including acute diabetes and ketoacidosis. Monitoring for changes in blood glucose levels in patients taking atypical antipsychotics may be indicated. More systematic study data are clearly needed.", 
    "95": "Midazolam is a broadly used drug that can enhance tolerance to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with cardiac conditions. Adverse reactions to midazolam have been described previously. We describe central-nervous side effects in 6 of 104 consecutive patients.", 
    "96": "One hundred four patients undergoing TEE-diagnostic procedure were investigated. TEE was performed using a SSA 360 Power Vision ultrasound unit (Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) and a 5- to 6-MHz probe. Indication for TEE was evaluation of cardiac valves (6), search for cardiac embolism (23), patent foramen ovale or atrial septum defect (20), left ventricular dysfunction (11), aortic dissection (7), and other (37). Midazolam and, if necessary, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (0.25-0.5 mg) were administered intravenously.", 
    "97": "The mean cumulative dose of midazolam administered in small fractions was 4.8 +/- 2 mg. In 6 of 104 patients (5.7%) clinically significant adverse effects to midazolam occurred. The reactions were aggressiveness, euphoria, depression, and intense hiccups (singultus) despite low doses of midazolam. The severest forms of these adverse effects to midazolam could be successfully treated with intravenous infusion of flumazenil (0.25-0.5 mg intravenously).", 
    "98": "Adverse effects including aggressive, euphoric, or depressive behavior can occur in a significant proportion (6%) of patients with cardiac conditions undergoing TEE after intravenous administration of midazolam. The administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse the adverse effects to midazolam successfully.", 
    "99": "Automated methods are required for the analysis of brain single photon emission tomography images. We applied an automated method to assess the benzodiazepine receptor distribution in the brain. Images of 19 patients with mild traumatic brain injury who had received I NNC 13-8241 were compared with a mean brain template accumulated from 18 healthy volunteers. To obtain more information, we calculated the neuronal benzodiazepine receptor binding in the brain by using pre-defined anatomical regions and a voxel-by-voxel technique. The group of patients with mild traumatic brain injury differed significantly (P =0.015) from the group of healthy volunteers in the distribution of benzodiazepine receptors. This methodological work suggests that a reference based template and a three-dimensional brain model help in regional analysis and quantification and could be useful in demonstrating permanent neuronal damage after head injury.", 
    "100": "To determine which is the most effective and safe treatment for controlling seizures in children out-of-hospital: diazepam or midazolam.", 
    "101": "A retrospective review of the medical records of children presenting to the Emergency Department of the Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW-ED) with seizures requiring treatment in the field by paramedics was carried out over a 4-year period (April 1996 to March 2000). In New South Wales, children with seizures in the prehospital setting received 0.5 mg/kg per rectum (p.r.) or 0.1 mg/kg i.v. diazepam until March 1998 and from March 1997 onwards they received 0.15 mg/kg i.m. or 0.1 mg/kg i.v. midazolam. The main outcome measured was cessation of seizure in the prehospital setting. Secondary outcomes were time taken to initiate treatment and the frequency of cardiorespiratory compromise.", 
    "102": "Over the 4-year period, 2566 children presented to CHW-ED with a seizure; 107 children were eligible for entry into the present study. Of these 107 patients, 62 received diazepam and 45 received midazolam. Thirty-one (50.0%) in the diazepam group and 15 (33.3%) in the midazolam group were febrile seizures. Both groups were similar in terms of demographics and seizure type. A comparison of diazepam with midazolam showed that both drugs were effective in stopping seizures within 5 min of drug administration (37.1% cf. 51.1%). Fewer patients in the midazolam group suffered apnoea (20.0% cf. 29.0%; P < 0.05).", 
    "103": "Midazolam controls seizures as effectively as diazepam in the prehospital setting. Furthermore, midazolam potentially reduces respiratory depression and time to treatment.", 
    "104": "The aim of the present study was to carry out a controlled pilot study on the putative anxiolytic effect of valepotriates. Thirty-six outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder (DSM III-R), after a 2-week wash-out, were randomized to one of the following three treatments for 4 weeks (n = 12 per group): valepotriates (mean daily dose: 81.3 mg), diazepam (mean daily dose: 6.5 mg), or placebo. A parallel, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled design was employed. No significant difference was observed among the three groups at baseline or in the change from baseline on the Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) or in the trait part of the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI-trait). Moreover, the three groups presented a significant reduction in the total HAM-A scores. On the other hand, only the diazepam and valepotriates groups showed a significant reduction in the psychic factor of HAM-A. The diazepam group also presented a significant reduction of the STAI-trait. Although the principal analysis (HAM-A between group comparison) found negative results (probably due to the small sample size in each group), the preliminary data obtained in the present study suggest that the valepotriates may have a potential anxiolytic effect on the psychic symptoms of anxiety. However, since the number of subjects per group was very small, the present results must be viewed as preliminary. Thus, further studies addressing this issue are warranted.", 
    "105": "The aim of this prospective open label study was to assess the efficacy of olanzapine for motor symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD). Olanzapine was administrated to nine patients with genetically confirmed HD in increasing doses until satisfactory clinical effect or the appearance of side effects. The patients were evaluated at baseline and after 14 days of treatment using the motor scale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS). The patients improved significantly in most subscores of the UHDRS, including fine motor tasks, although some patients needed a rather high dose (30 mg per day). No adverse effects were reported by the patents spontaneously or were observed directly by the investigator. High-dose olanzapine seems to be useful in choreatic HD patients. A double blind, placebo-controlled trial appears warranted to definitively establish the symptomatic value of olanzapine in HD.", 
    "106": "This study used schedule-controlled responding to examine the acute and chronic effects of the neuroactive steroid and positive -aminobutyric acid A (GABA ) modulator pregnanolone. Pregnanolone, the positive GABA modulator triazolam, the GABA chloride channel site antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and the -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine were administered to monkeys ( = 4) responding under a multiple fixed ratio (FR/FR) schedule of food presentation and stimulus shock termination (SST), before, during and after daily treatment with pregnanolone (3.2 mg/kg subcutaneously). Pregnanolone decreased responding in a dose- and time-related manner, with a duration of action of <2 h. Mutual antagonism occurred between pregnanolone and PTZ in the food component, and PTZ antagonized pregnanolone in the SST component. Daily treatment with pregnanolone increased the sensitivity to PTZ 24 h but not 2 h after daily pregnanolone administration, and daily pregnanolone treatment did not alter the sensitivity to pregnanolone, triazolam or ketamine. Baseline responding in the food component was decreased in some monkeys 24 h after daily pregnanolone administration and in all monkeys 48 h after discontinuation of daily pregnanolone treatment. These results suggest that positive GABA modulation is one mechanism by which pregnanolone decreases FR responding, and that dependence resulting from daily pregnanolone treatment is not necessarily accompanied by tolerance to pregnanolone. Failure of pregnanolone to confer tolerance under these conditions might suggest that neuroadaptations at the GABA receptor complex vary according to the site at which positive GABA modulation occurs.", 
    "107": "The unstable elevated exposed plus-maze (UEEPM) is a novel model of extreme anxiety which elicits unconditioned flight/escape behaviour in rats. The current studies aimed to investigate further the predictive validity of the paradigm, by examining the effects on UEEPM behaviour of both clinically effective (chronic fluoxetine) and ineffective (acute fluoxetine and chlordiazepoxide) treatments for panic disorder. In the first experiment, male Brown Norway rats received a single injection of fluoxetine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg p.o.) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 1.0-10.0 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min prior to UEEPM exposure. In the second experiment, in order to assess the effects of chronic dosing or handling on baseline UEEPM behaviour, subjects received either 21 days vehicle injection (p.o.) or handling, before being exposed to the test. Finally, rats received 21 days fluoxetine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) in their food, before being tested in the UEEPM. Acute CDP and fluoxetine had no effect on UEEPM behaviour. Chronic handling and vehicle administration (p.o.) significantly reduced escape in the UEEPM, hence preventing the effects of chronic fluoxetine administration from being investigated by p.o. dosing. Chronic fluoxetine in subjects' food (10.0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated animals' propensity to escape from the UEEPM. The results further support the pharmacological similarity between symptoms of panic in humans and escape in the UEEPM and suggest that the UEEPM may represent a paradigm to facilitate investigation into the neurochemical basis of extreme anxiety disorders.", 
    "108": "Clinical reports and animal experiments indicate that both cocaine administration and cocaine withdrawal increase anxiety. We investigated the ability of a number of putative anxiolytic agents to alleviate these anxiety states using the elevated plus-maze. Rats in the cocaine condition received either saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg) 40 min prior to testing; those in the withdrawal condition were tested 48 h following a chronic treatment regime (saline or cocaine 20 mg/kg per day for 14 days). Prior to testing, animals received a benzodiazepine (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg diazepam), a serotonergic agonist (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg buspirone), an antihistamine (50 mg/kg dimenhydrinate or 27 mg/kg diphenhydramine) or a saline injection. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally. Cocaine administration and cocaine withdrawal reduced the percentage time spent on and the number of entries into the open arms. Diazepam dose-dependently alleviated cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety and non-significantly attenuated cocaine-induced anxiety. Buspirone, dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine did not consistently alleviate the anxiety caused by either cocaine pre-treatment regime; in the saline conditions, however, each of these treatments was anxiogenic. In summary, benzodiazepines alleviated cocaine-induced anxiety, while future research on the ability of serotonergic and antihistaminergic drugs to alleviate these anxiety states is warranted.", 
    "109": "Nine hundred and ten schizophrenic inpatients suffering from acute psychotic episodes were included in a naturalistic study. Patients were prescribed treatment with olanzapine (OLZ) or with typical antipsychotic (TYP) drugs. Patients receiving another atypical antipsychotic were excluded. Of the whole sample, 483 (53.4%) were treated with olanzapine and 421 (46.6%) with typical antipsychotics. Three specific subpopulations of greater severity were defined: patients with prominent psychotic symptoms, agitated patients, and patients initially treated with intramuscular (i.m.) medication because of their acute clinical condition. Severity of illness was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale for severity, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Nursing Observational Scale for Inpatient Evaluation. Baseline differences were adjusted per data analysis. The mean change from baseline to endpoint of overall symptomatology (total BPRS score) was significantly greater in the olanzapine group compared to the typical antipsychotic-treated group, both in the sample of patients with prominent positive symptoms (P < 0.001) and in the sample of agitated patients (P =0.015). Significant differences were also found in BPRS positive scores, BPRS negative scores and CGI scores in these two populations. Patients who had received previous i.m. drugs showed no statistically significant differences in symptomatic improvement between both treatments groups, except for a more favourable response of BPRS negative subscores in the olanzapine group (P =0.015). The results suggest that olanzapine may be considered as a first line treatment for severely psychotic inpatients with schizophrenia.", 
    "110": "A series of new pyridobenzodiazepines with variation of the basic side chain were synthesized and evaluated for their binding to D(4.2), D(2L), and 5-HT(2A) receptors in comparison with clozapine, haloperidol, and two parent compounds previously described, 8-chloro-6-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-11H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine (8) and 8-methyl-6-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-11H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine (9). In the piperazine series, replacing the N-methyl group by a N-phenyl moiety (15-17, 30-32) provided a dramatic decrease of affinity for all receptors (K(i) > 1000 nM). A N-cyclohexyl group (20, 35) restored some affinity. Compounds with a N-benzyl (18, 33) or N-phenethyl side chain (19, 34) had significant affinities at D(4.2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors. Homologation of the piperazine nucleus (29, 44) led to a significant decrease of the affinity at all receptors investigated. In the 4-aminopiperidine series, N-methyl derivatives (21, 36) possessed less affinity in comparison with the N-methylpiperazine analogues (8, 9) while the N-benzyl congeners (22, 37) showed similar affinities. The rigidification of piperidine nucleus as obtained in azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives (23, 38) involved a slight reduction of the affinity at D(4.2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors while the affinity at D(2L) receptors was dramatically increased. The introduction of N-substituted aminoalkylamines to replace N-methylpiperazine generally led to a significant decrease in the affinity for D(4.2) receptors but some of these molecules (24, 25, 41) presented a significant 5-HT(2A) binding affinity. The presence of a more flexible side chain induced an increased conformational freedom. Consequently, the preferential position of the distal nitrogen or its basicity in piperazine derivatives was greatly modified. 19 with a high D(4.2) and 5-HT(2A) affinity (K(i) = 40 and 103 nM, respectively) did not induce cataleptic phenomenon in the paw test in rats but significantly reduced the immobility time in Porsolt's test in mice suggesting antidepressant properties.",

Upon the identification of receptor subtypes, we set out to discover selective agents with the anticipation that these agents would have superior therapeutic potential. Herein, we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of substituted 7,8,9,10-tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-c]pyrido[3,4-e]pyrimidin-5(6H)-ones and disclose that these compounds exhibit functional selectivity at the benzodiazepine receptor of GABA(A) receptor subtypes.

    "116": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drug of choice for treatment of patients with panic disorder. Most patients have a favorable response to SSRI therapy; however, 30 percent will not be able to tolerate these drugs or will have an unfavorable or incomplete response. Strategies to improve management of such patients include optimizing SSRI dosing (starting at a low dose and slowly increasing the dose to reach the target dose) and ensuring an adequate trial before switching to a different drug. Benzodiazepines should be avoided but, when necessary, may be used for a short duration or may be used long-term in patients for whom other treatments have failed. Slower-onset, longer-acting benzodiazepines are preferred. All patients should be encouraged to try cognitive behavior therapy. Augmentation therapy should be considered in patients who do not have a complete response. Drugs to consider for use in augmentation therapy include benzodiazepines, buspirone, beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and valproate sodium.", 
    "117": "Physiological cell death (PCD), a process by which redundant or unsuccessful neurons are deleted by apoptosis (cell suicide) from the developing central nervous system, has been recognized as a natural phenomenon for many years. Whether environmental factors can interact with PCD mechanisms to increase the number of neurons undergoing PCD, thereby converting this natural phenomenon into a pathological process, is an interesting question for which new answers are just now becoming available. In a series of recent studies we have shown that 2 major classes of drugs (those that block NMDA glutamate receptors and those that promote GABAA receptor activation), when administered to immature rodents during the period of synaptogenesis, trigger widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the developing brain. In addition, we have found that ethanol, which has both NMDA antagonist and GABAmimetic properties, triggers a robust pattern of apoptotic neurodegeneration, thereby deleting large numbers of neurons from many different regions of the developing brain. These findings provide a more likely explanation than has heretofore been available for the reduced brain mass and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The period of synaptogenesis, also known as the brain growth spurt period, occurs in different species at different times relative to birth. In rats and mice it is a postnatal event, but in humans it extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. Thus, there is a period in pre- and postnatal human development, lasting for several years, during which immature CNS neurons are prone to commit suicide if exposed to intoxicating concentrations of drugs with NMDA antagonist or GABAmimetic properties. These findings are important, not only because of their relevance to the FAS, but because there are many agents in the human environment, other than ethanol, that have NMDA antagonist or GABAmimetic properties. Such agents include drugs that may be abused by pregnant mothers (ethanol, phencyclidine [angel dust], ketamine [Special K], nitrous oxide [laughing gas], barbiturates, benzodiazepines), and many medicinals used in obstetric and pediatric neurology (anticonvulsants), and anesthesiology (all general anesthetics are either NMDA antagonists or GABAmimetics).",

    "122": "The human CYP3A subfamily plays a dominant role in the metabolic elimination of more drugs than any other biotransformation enzyme. CYP3A enzyme is localized in the liver and small intestine and thus contributes to first-pass and systemic metabolism. CYP3A expression varies as much as 40-fold in liver and small intestine donor tissues. CYP3A-dependent in vivo drug clearance appears to be unimodally distributed which suggests multi-genic or complex gene-environment causes of variability. Interindividual differences in enzyme expression may be due to several factors including: variable homeostatic control mechanisms, disease states that alter homeostasis, up- or down-regulation by environmental stimuli (such as smoking, drug intake, or diet), and genetic mutations. This review summarizes the current understanding and implications of genetic variation in the CYP3A enzymes. Unlike other human P450s (CYP2D6, CYP2C19) there is no evidence of a 'null' allele for CYP3A4. More than 30 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) have been identified in the CYP3A4 gene. Generally, variants in the coding regions of CYP3A4 occur at allele frequencies <5% and appear as heterozygous with the wild-type allele. These coding variants may contribute to but are not likely to be the major cause of inter-individual differences in CYP3A-dependent clearance, because of the low allele frequencies and limited alterations in enzyme expression or catalytic function. The most common variant, CYP3A4*1B, is an A-392G transition in the 5'-flanking region with an allele frequency ranging from 0% (Chinese and Japanese) to 45% (African-Americans). Studies have not linked CYP3A4*1B with alterations in CYP3A substrate metabolism. In contrast, there are several reports about its association with various disease states including prostate cancer, secondary leukemias, and early puberty. Linkage disequilibrium between CYP3A4*1B and another CYP3A allele (CYP3A5*1) may be the true cause of the clinical phenotype. CYP3A5 is polymorphically expressed in adults with readily detectable expression in about 10-20% in Caucasians, 33% in Japanese and 55% in African-Americans. The primary causal mutation for its polymorphic expression (CYP3A5*3) confers low CYP3A5 protein expression as a result of improper mRNA splicing and reduced translation of a functional protein. The CYP3A5*3 allele frequency varies from approximately 50% in African-Americans to 90% in Caucasians. Functionally, microsomes from a CYP3A5*3/*3 liver contain very low CYP3A5 protein and display on average reduced catalytic activity towards midazolam. Additional intronic or exonic mutations (CYP3A5*5, *6, and *7) may alter splicing and result in premature stop codons or exon deletion. Several CYP3A5 coding variants have been described, but occur at relatively low allelic frequencies and their functional significance has not been established. As CYP3A5 is the primary extrahepatic CYP3A isoform, its polymorphic expression may be implicated in disease risk and the metabolism of endogenous steroids or xenobiotics in these tissues (e.g., lung, kidney, prostate, breast, leukocytes). CYP3A7 is considered to be the major fetal liver CYP3A enzyme. Although hepatic CYP3A7 expression appears to be significantly down-regulated after birth, protein and mRNA have been detected in adults. Recently, increased CYP3A7 mRNA expression has been associated with the replacement of a 60-bp segment of the CYP3A7 promoter with a homologous segment in the CYP3A4 promoter (CYP3A7*1C allele). This mutational swap confers increased gene transcription due to an enhanced interaction between activated PXR:RXRalpha complex and its cognate response element (ER-6). The genetic basis for polymorphic expression of CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 has now been established. Moreover, the substrate specificity and product regioselectivity of these isoforms can differ from that of CYP3A4, such that the impact of CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 polymorphic expression on drug disposition will be drug dependent. In addition to genetic variation, other factors that may also affect CYher factors that may also affect CYP3A expression include: tissue-specific splicing (as reported for prostate CYP3A5), variable control of gene transcription by endogenous molecules (circulating hormones) and exogenous molecules (diet or environment), and genetic variations in proteins that may regulate constitutive and inducible CYP3A expression (nuclear hormone receptors). Thus, the complex regulatory pathways, environmentally susceptible milieu of the CYP3A enzymes, and as yet undetermined genetic haplotypes, may confound evaluation of the effect of individual CYP3A genetic variations on drug disposition, efficacy and safety.", 
    "123": "Treatment with antipsychotics is a common approach for personality disorder. Conventional antipsychotics may be efficacious particularly against psychoticism, but less against other symptoms in these patients. They are, furthermore, associated with adverse drug reactions poorly tolerated by patients with personality disorder. Atypical antipsychotics have a more convenient pharmacological profile with a lower risk for extrapyramidal symptoms and a broader therapeutic profile, showing some efficacy against impulsivity, aggressivity and affective symptoms. The medical records of ten patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of a cluster B personality disorder who had received olanzapine treatment were reviewed. A mirror-image design anchored to the start date of olanzapine treatment and extending 8 weeks in either direction was used. The assessment consisted of a qualitative chart review and a retrospective completion of the GCI-C and an adapted French version of the SDAS, using the observer-rated items. The olanzapine dose range was 2.5-20 mg during the 8 weeks of observation. The mean SDAS score (items 1-15) was 28.8+/-8.4 for the 8 weeks preceding olanzapine prescription and was improved to 13.6+/-5.8 after 8 weeks of treatment.", 
    "124": "The relationship between the cerebral pharmacokinetics of diazepam and its active metabolites (desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam) and the anxiolytic effect evaluated by the four-plates test and the light/dark test were investigated after a single intra-peritoneal injection of diazepam (1 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg). For up to 30 min after administration, the sedative effect interfered with the anxiolytic effect, thus the results of the anxiolytic effect were not interpretable. From 30 min to 60 min after administration, this interference disappeared, the cerebral level of benzodiazepines was stable (the brain elimination of diazepam was compensated for by the appearance of desmethyldiazepam followed by oxazepam) but the anxiolytic effect decreased dramatically in all the tests with diazepam 1 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg. The acute tolerance to benzodiazepines and the difference of affinity for subtypes of GABA(A) receptors between diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam could explain this result.", 
    "125": "Olanzapine is a widely used, newer antipsychotic agent, which is metabolized by various pathways: hydroxylation and N-demethylation by cytochrome P450, N-oxidation by flavin monooxygenase and direct glucuronidation. In vivo studies have pointed towards the latter pathway as being of major importance. Accordingly, the glucuronidation reaction was studied in vitro using cDNA-expressed human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes and a pooled human liver microsomal preparation (HLM). Glucuronidated olanzapine was determined by HPLC after acid or enzymatic hydrolysis. The following UGT-isoenzymes were screened for their ability to glucuronidate olanzapine: 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7 and 2B15. Only UGT1A4 was able to glucuronidate olanzapine obeying saturation kinetics. The K(m) value was 227 micromol/l (SE 43), i.e. of the same order of magnitude as for other psychotropic drugs, and the V(max) value was 2370 pmol/(min mg) (SE 170). Glucuronidation was also mediated by the HLM preparation, but a saturation level was not reached. The olanzapine glucuronidation reaction was inhibited by several drugs known as substrates for UGT1A4, e.g. amitriptyline, trifluoperazine and lamotrigine. Thus, competition for glucuronidation by UGT1A4 represents a possibility for drug-drug interactions in subjects receiving several of these psychotropic drugs at the same time. Whether such possible interactions are of any clinical importance may await further studies in patients.",

    "127": "The effects of two nights of treatment with the short-acting benzodiazepine receptor agonist zaleplon, triazolam, or placebo was assessed in chronic primary insomniacs using two concurrent, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, Latin Square crossover studies. Study 1 (n = 47) compared zaleplon (10 and 40 mg) to triazolam (0.25 mg) and placebo. Study 2 (n = 36) compared zaleplon (20 and 60 mg) to triazolam (0.25 mg) and placebo. For each study, polysomnographically recorded sleep parameters and patient reports of sleep quality were collected during baseline and two consecutive nights during the four treatment phases in each study. All doses of zaleplon produced significant decreases in latency to persistent sleep. Although no minimally effective dose could be determined, dose-response effects were apparent. Triazolam 0.25 mg produced a decrease in latency to persistent sleep that was comparable to that of zaleplon 10 mg. Only the triazolam dose and the 60 mg dose of zaleplon produced significant increases in total sleep time over placebo. Zaleplon 40 and 60 mg and triazolam produced decreases in the percentage of REM sleep compared to placebo. Patient reports of efficacy were consistent with objective findings. In addition, all doses of zaleplon tended to increase while triazolam decreased the percentage of stage 3/4 sleep. There was no evidence of residual daytime impairment for any of the zaleplon doses, however, triazolam administration produced significant impairment in performance on a digit copying test. A higher number of adverse events were seen with the 40 and 60 mg doses of zaleplon compared to triazolam (0.25) and placebo. At higher doses, zaleplon is more effective than triazolam at reducing latency to persistent sleep in chronic insomnia and is not associated with the decrease in slow-wave sleep or residual impairment observed with triazolam. However, increases in total sleep time were apparent only at doses which produced concomitant increases in the number of adverse events. In contrast, triazolam (0.25 mg) produced increases in total sleep time (;25 min) and decreases in latency to persistent sleep at a dose of 0.25 mg. Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", 
    "128": "Benzodiazepines produce memory disturbance after acute administration. It is not clear whether chronic use of benzodiazepines is hazardous to memory processes. Epidemiological data indicate that a large proportion (10-30 per cent) of individuals with sleep dysfunction take hypnotic aids for a year or longer. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate self-reported memory dysfunction in a sample of individuals who considered their sleep disturbance sufficiently severe to seek investigation in sleep clinics. It was hypothesized that individuals taking benzodiazepines for sleep would report greater perceived everyday memory failures than individuals taking other sleep aids or no medication. Questionnaires were given to 368 individuals referred into the study by investigators in six sleep disorders clinics. All respondents completed a lengthy (700-item) questionnaire, which included scales assessing memory difficulties, affective status and sleep disturbance. Respondents also reported any medication use for sleep problems and duration of use of the current drug. Information on medication use was reported by 289 participants. Fifty-six per cent of respondents reported using some form of psychoactive medication (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, Zopiclone). Twenty-two per cent reported using no medication. Analysis of covariance showed that these medications had no detectable effect on subjective memory difficulties during chronic use, F(4,226)=1.34, p=0.25. Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", 
    "129": "Zolpidem (AMBIEN((R))), an imidazopyridine, is now the most commonly prescribed hypnotic in the United States. Zolpidem is neuropharmacologically distinct from benzodiazepine hypnotics in that it binds with low affinity to alpha(5)-containing GABA(A)-receptor subtypes. Despite its unique benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile, the results of most of the published studies conducted with humans suggest that the absolute magnitude of impairment produced by zolpidem is comparable to that observed with benzodiazepine hypnotics like triazolam. The present study compared the acute effects of zolpidem (0, 7.5, 15 and 22.5 mg) and triazolam (0, 0.1875, 0.375 and 0.5625 mg) in 10 non-drug-abusing humans using a Digit-Enter-and-Recall task with varying delay intervals (0, 10 and 20 s). To more fully characterize the behavioral effects of zolpidem and triazolam, several other performance tasks and subject-rated drug-effect questionnaires were included. Zolpidem and triazolam impaired performance on the Digit-Enter-and-Recall task as a function of dose under all delay intervals. However, the dose-related effects of the drugs interacted differentially with the delay interval such that zolpidem produced significantly less impairment than triazolam following the longest delay (i.e., 20 s). Zolpidem and triazolam produced comparable dose-related impairment on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), circular lights task, and picture recall/recognition task. Zolpidem and triazolam generally produced qualitatively and quantitatively similar subject-rated drug effects, although some between-drug differences were observed. Consistent with the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, the effects of zolpidem peaked sooner and were shorter in duration than those observed with triazolam. The results of this experiment suggest that zolpidem may have less potential than triazolam to impair recall, which may be due to differences between these compounds in terms of their benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile. The results of the present study are also concordant with previous studies that found that drugs that act at the GABA(A)-receptor complex can be differentiated based on their interaction with the delay interval on a Digit-Enter-and-Recall task.

    "130": "The challenge in developing hypnotic agents for the treatment of insomnia is to balance the sedative effect needed at bedtime with the residual sedation on awakening. Zaleplon is a novel pyrazolopyrimidine hypnotic agent that acts as a selective agonist to the brain omega(1) receptor situated on the alpha(1) subunit of the GABA(A) receptor complex. Zaleplon was proven to be an effective hypnotic drug as it consistently and significantly reduced latency to persistent sleep in insomniac patients for doses of 10 mg and above in polysomnography studies. The pharmacodynamic profile of zaleplon on psychomotor performance, actual driving and cognitive function, including memory, was assessed in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in healthy young subjects as well as insomniac patients by using various positive controls (zolpidem, zopiclone, triazolam and flurazepam). The recommended hypnotic dose of zaleplon in young adults (10 mg) produced minimal or no impairment of psychomotor and memory performance even when administered during the night as little as 1 h before waking. No impairment of actual driving was observed when zaleplon 10 mg was administered either at bedtime or in the middle of the night as little as 4 h before waking. Zaleplon 20 mg, twice the recommended dose, generally produced significant impairment of performance and cognitive functions when these functions were measured at the time of peak plasma concentration, i.e. 1 h after dose administration, and no impairment of driving abilities was observed 4 h after a middle-of-the-night administration. In contrast, consistent detrimental residual effects on various aspects of psychomotor and cognitive functions were observed with the therapeutic doses of the various commonly prescribed hypnotic agents used as comparators, e.g. zolpidem 10 mg up to 5 h after dose administration, zopiclone 7.5 mg up to 10 h after, flurazepam 30 mg up to 14 h after and triazolam 0.25 mg up to 6 h after. Also, zolpidem 10 mg and zopiclone 7.5 mg were also shown to significantly impair driving ability the next morning when this was measured 4 h and up to 10 h after dose administration, respectively. The present review shows that zaleplon 10 mg has little or no residual effect when administered in the middle of the night, as late as 1 h before waking, and is devoid of impairment of driving abilities as assessed by actual driving 4 h after dose administration. The lack of clinically significant or minimally statistically significant residual effects of zaleplon even at its peak concentration may be explained by its unique pharmacokinetic (rapid elimination half-life) and pharmacodynamic (low affinity, and specific binding profile to various subunits of the GABA(A)receptor) profiles. These properties allow zaleplon to be used for treatment of symptoms only when they occur, either at bedtime or later in the night, without incurring significant risk of developing next-day impairment of psychomotor and cognitive functioning.

    "131": "Benzodiazepines and other psychotropic drugs have been implicated in the production of memory deficits. The mechanism is unclear, but both a distinct pharmacological action and a non-specific sedative effect have been suggested as being causal or contributory. These two postulated mechanisms of action may be examined separately by using sleep deprivation as a method of non-pharmacological sedation. We measured psychomotor and memory functions in eight sleep-deprived healthy volunteers and eight controls. There was both subjective and objective evidence of sedation, but memory function was not affected. These findings support the view that the effect on memory of psychotropic drugs is principally caused by a direct amnestic effect rather than by drug-induced sedation.

    "132": "Rationale: Alcohol, benzodiazepines and barbiturates act through the GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptor (GBzR). Patients with some forms of anxiety disorder have reduced GBzR sensivity, although it is not clear whether this is a state or a trait phenomenon. We have developed a paradigm for assessing GBzR sensitivity using slowing of saccadic eye movements in response to intravenous midazolam.Objectives: To obtain reliability data for GBzR sensitivity in normal volunteers and to look at factors that might influence sensitivity.Methods: Five male volunteers received an intravenous infusion of midazolam (50 &mgr;m/kg) given over 10 min. Saccadic eye movement velocity (SEMV) was recorded at baseline and at 15 min intervals up to 120 min post infusion. Blood was taken at these times for mixazolam assay. The study was repeated at 4 weeks. Pharmacodynamic (PD) effect was calculated by measuring area under the curve (AUC) of SEMV plot versus time for each individual on both study days. Pharmacokinetic (PK) effect was calculated by measuring AUC from t = 0 to t = 120 min. Ratio of PD/PK effect was then calculated to give a measure of GBzR sensitivity.Results: There was a very strong correlation between individual GBzR sensitivity on both study days (r = 0.99; p = 0.008).Conclusion: The results suggest that GBzR sensitivity is relatively stable over time in normal volunteers and that the paradigm described has good reliability.

PSG demonstrated decreased sleep efficiency (primary target variable), total sleep time (TST) and S2 as well as increased middle and late insomnia, S1, S3+S4, snoring and PLM in patients. There were no intergroup differences in REM variables. Subjective sleep quality deteriorated, as did drive and fine motor activity in the morning, while concentration increased. Blood pressure in the evening and morning and pulse rate in the evening were elevated. These differences as compared with normals were distinct from those observed in other sleep disorders. In a subsequent acute, placebo-controlled cross-over design study, patients received alprazolam 0.5 mg (Xanor((R));) and placebo. As compared with placebo, alprazolam induced an increase in sleep efficiency (primary target variable), TST and S2, a decrease in wakefulness during the total sleep period, S3+S4 and the oxygen desaturation and PLM indices, and improved subjective sleep quality, somatic complaints, drive, affectivity and drowsiness in the morning. There were no changes in REM variables. Thus, alprazolam induced changes that were opposite to the differences observed between patients and controls before treatment, thereby normalizing sleep and awakening quality. As observed in insomnia related to GAD and subsequent benzodiazepine therapy, the present study also points to a key-lock principle in the treatment of insomnia caused by anxiety disorders and neurophysiologically visualizes processes at the receptor level (e.g. benzodiazepine agonists versus inverse agonists).

FGIN-1-27 and PK 11195, but not clonazepam, potently induced apoptosis. FGIN-1-27 was shown to sequentially decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential, then to activate caspase-3 and finally to cause DNA fragmentation. In addition, PBR-specific ligands induced cell cycle arrest in the G1/G0 phase. Our data qualify PBR-specific ligands as innovative proapoptotic and antiproliferative substances. They might prove suitable for the treatment of esophageal cancer."
