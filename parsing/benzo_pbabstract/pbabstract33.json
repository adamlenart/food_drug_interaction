However, its effect on cerebral vessels is not well known. Therefore, we investigated the cerebrovascular reactivity to topical and intravenous JM-1232(-) and during hypotension or hypercapnia with intravenous administration of JM-1232(-). We used a closed cranial window preparation to measure the changes of cerebral pial arteriolar diameters in isoflurane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. We first measured the direct effect of topical JM-1232(-). We then determined the effect of intravenous JM-1232(-) and then we measured the response to hypercapnia before and after JM-1232(-) infusion. Finally, we measured the reaction to stepwise induction of hypotension before and after JM-1232(-) infusion. Topical infusion of JM-1232(-) dilated pial arterioles. Intravenous infusion of JM-1232(-) changed pial arterioles by 4.5 \u00b1 2.7 %, 5.0 \u00b1 3.9 %, and -2.8 \u00b1 2.6 % (at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg/min, respectively). Hypercapnia dilated pial arterioles before and after JM-1232(-) infusion. The diameters of pial arterioles did not change during hypotension before or after intravenous JM-1232(-) infusion. These results indicate that topical JM-1232(-) has a dilative effect on pial arterioles and that intravenous administration of JM-1232(-) may not affect cerebrovascular reactivity to hypotension or hypercapnia.",

In view of the high percentage of young females with BPD, 18-40 year-old female patients with BPD were compared with patients of the same age but with depression (unipolar and bipolar) and schizophrenia. Typical sedative antipsychotics and anticonvulsants were prescribed more often in BPD than in the other diagnostic groups, with the exception of bipolar depression; this was true for the single substances quetiapine, levomepromazine, chlorprothixene, carbamazepine, and valproate. A limitation of the study was the use of clinical data without verifying the diagnoses by structured interviews. Contrary to the guidelines, about 90% of in-patients with BPD received psychotropic drugs. Polypharmacy was common, and antipsychotics with sedative profiles such as quetiapine and mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants such as valproate appear to be preferred.",

ACEA (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly enhanced the anticonvulsant potency of pregabalin in the mouse maximal electroshock-induced seizure model by decreasing the median effective dose (ED50 ) of pregabalin from 125.39 to 78.06 mg/kg (P < 0.05). In contrast, ACEA (2.5 mg/kg) had no significant impact on the anticonvulsant potency of clobazam and lacosamide in the mouse maximal electroshock-induced seizure model. On the other hand, ACEA (2.5 mg/kg) did not affect acute adverse effects of clobazam, lacosamide or pregabalin, and the median toxic doses (TD50 ) for the studied anti-epileptic drugs in combination with ACEA did not differ from the TD50 values as determined for the drugs administered alone in the chimney test. In conclusion, ACEA ameliorates the pharmacological profile of pregabalin, when considering both the anticonvulsant and the acute adverse effects of the drug in preclinical study on animals. The combination of pregabalin with ACEA can be of pivotal importance for patients with epilepsy as a potentially advantageous combination if the results from this study translate into clinical settings.",

Day 1 consisted of morning and afternoon 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic or hypoglycemic clamps with or without 1 mg alprazolam given 30 min before a clamp. Day 2 consisted of 90-min euglycemic cycling exercise at 50% VO2max. Despite similar euglycemia (5.3 \u00b1 0.1 mmol/L) and insulinemia (46 \u00b1 6 pmol/L) during day 2 exercise studies, GABA A activation with alprazolam during day 1 euglycemia resulted in significant blunting of plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone responses. Lipolysis (glycerol, nonesterified fatty acids) and endogenous glucose production during exercise were also reduced, and glucose infusion rates were increased following prior euglycemia with alprazolam. Prior hypoglycemia with alprazolam resulted in further reduction of glucagon and cortisol responses during exercise.

Here we addressed this issue by evaluating the impact of a 6-h-long midazolam exposure on the development of calbindin-, calretinin- and parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons.", 
    "51": "Physiological expression patterns of calbindin-, calretinin-, and parvalbumin-positive neurons as well as the impact of a 6-h-long midazolam exposure on these cell populations were evaluated in the medial prefrontal cortex of Wistar rats at defined stages of the brain growth spurt using stereological analysis. Activated caspase-3 immunohistochemistry was used to quantify apoptotic death in controls and midazolam-treated subjects.", 
    "52": "In control animals, the number of parvalbumin expressing cells significantly (p<0.01) increased while those of calbindin positive populations significantly (p<0.01) decreased between postnatal day 10 and 20. Expression of calretinin remained constant during this period. Immediately following exposure, midazolam induced neuroapoptosis at both early (postnatal day 5, p=0.016) and later (postnatal day 15, p=0.025) stages of brain development. While this did not diminish overall neuronal density in the medial prefrontal cortex, exposure at P5 led to a subsequent increase in the number of parvalbumin positive neurons in lower cortical layers, and midazolam administration at P15 increased the number of both parvalbumin and calretinin expressing neurons 5 days following exposure.", 
    "53": "These observations demonstrate that midazolam exposure can impair the physiological differentiation patterns of GABAergic interneurons during the brain growth spurt. Considering the important role of GABAergic networks in neuronal physiology, these data provide us with one potential mechanism that could account for the lasting neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits observed in the context of anesthesia exposure in the early postnatal period.", 
    "54": "Different regimens are used for sedation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Our objectives were to compare safety, ease of treatment, recovery, and patients' experiences using patient-controlled sedation (PCS) with propofol, nurse anesthetist-controlled sedation (ACS), or the department's standard of care, midazolam given by the procedure team (control group).", 
    "55": "The study included 281 adults in 301 procedures. The PCS group (n = 101) delivered bolus doses of 5 mg of propofol according to their need for sedation. The ACS group (n = 100) had 2-8 mg/kg/h of propofol infused, with the target for sedation being level 3 of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. The control group was given 2-3 mg of midazolam for induction and additional 1 mg if required.", 
    "56": "PCS and ACS increased the ease of the procedure and reduced the number of sedation failures compared to midazolam sedation (ACS n = 0; PCS n = 4; midazolam n = 20). The ACS group had more deeply sedated patients (OAA/S level 2), desaturation, and obstructed airways than the PCS and midazolam groups. Time to full recovery (Aldrete score \u22659) was shortest following PCS. PCS resulted in the least fatigue and pain after the procedure. Patients' preference for PCS and ACS was the same.", 
    "57": "PCS with propofol is superior to midazolam and comparable to ACS. PCS resulted in a rapid recovery, fewer respiratory events, and was almost as effective as ACS in ensuring a successful examination.", 
    "58": "The main aim of this case series report is to alert physicians to the occurrence of catatonia in Down syndrome (DS). A second aim is to stimulate the study of regression in DS and of catatonia. A subset of individuals with DS is noted to experience unexplained regression in behavior, mood, activities of daily living, motor activities, and intellectual functioning during adolescence or young adulthood. Depression, early onset Alzheimer's, or just \"the Down syndrome\" are often blamed after general medical causes have been ruled out. Clinicians are generally unaware that catatonia, which can cause these symptoms, may occur in DS.", 
    "59": "Four DS adolescents who experienced regression are reported. Laboratory tests intended to rule out causes of motor and cognitive regression were within normal limits. Based on the presence of multiple motor disturbances (slowing and/or increased motor activity, grimacing, posturing), the individuals were diagnosed with unspecified catatonia and treated with anti-catatonic treatments (benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]).", 
    "60": "All four cases were treated with a benzodiazepine combined with ECT and recovered their baseline functioning.", 
    "61": "We suspect catatonia is a common cause of unexplained deterioration in adolescents and young adults with DS. Moreover, pediatricians and others who care for individuals with DS are generally unfamiliar with the catatonia diagnosis outside schizophrenia, resulting in misdiagnosis and years of morbidity. Alerting physicians to catatonia in DS is essential to prompt diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and identification of the frequency and course of this disorder.", 
    "62": "Few studies have examined anxiety recurrence after symptom remission in the primary care setting. We examined anxiety recurrence in the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) trial. From 2006 to 2009, CALM randomized adults with anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder) in primary care clinics to usual care (UC) or a collaborative care (CC) intervention of pharmacotherapy and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. We examined 274 patients who met criteria for anxiety remission (Brief Symptom Inventory for anxiety and somatization (BSI-12)\u00a0<\u00a06) after 6 months of randomized treatment and completed a follow-up of 18 months. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used to identify predictors of anxiety recurrence (BSI-12\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 and 50% increase from 6-month ratings) during the year following remission. Recurrence was lower in CC (29%) compared to UC (41%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Patients with comorbid depression or lower self-perceived socioeconomic status particularly benefited (in terms of reduced recurrence) if assigned to CC instead of UC. In the multivariable logistic regression model, smoking, being single, Anxiety Sensitivity Index score, functional impairment at month 6 due to residual anxiety (measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale), and treatment with benzodiazepines were associated with subsequent anxiety recurrence. ROC identified prognostic subgroups based on the risk of recurrence. Our study was exploratory, and our findings require replication. Future studies should also examine the effectiveness of relapse prevention programs in patients at highest risk for recurrence.", 
    "63": "Chronic insomnia is defined by difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening, and is coupled with daytime consequences such as fatigue, attention deficits, and mood instability. These symptoms persist over a period of at least 3 months (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 criteria). Chronic insomnia can be a symptom of many medical, neurological, and mental disorders. As a disorder, it incurs substantial health-care and occupational costs, and poses substantial risks for the development of cardiovascular and mental disorders, including cognitive deficits. Family and twin studies confirm that chronic insomnia can have a genetic component (heritability coefficients between 42% and 57%), whereas the investigation of autonomous and central nervous system parameters has identified hyperarousal as a final common pathway of the pathophysiology, implicating an imbalance of sleep-wake regulation consisting of either overactivity of the arousal systems, hypoactivity of the sleep-inducing systems, or both. Insomnia treatments include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Treatments currently under investigation include transcranial magnetic or electrical brain stimulation, and novel methods to deliver psychological interventions.", 
    "64": "For many years, flunitrazepam was the benzodiazepine of choice among users of illegal drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate to which extent clonazepam use has increased in this population, and whether this was related to increased prescription or because of illegal availability.", 
    "65": "We used data from three sources to study the changes in the use of clonazepam: (1) Presence and concentrations of clonazepam and flunitrazepam in blood samples collected from Norwegian drugged drivers; (2) Sales numbers (legal market) for clonazepam, extracted from the Norwegian prescription database (NorPD), and (3) Specific seizures (illegal market) for clonazepam in Norway.", 
    "66": "In 2004, 13.0% of the analysed blood samples from drugged drivers contained clonazepam, whereas this proportion had increased to 27.7% in 2013. In the same period, the frequency of flunitrazepam in drugged drivers decreased from 16.6% in 2004 to 3.2% in 2013. The number of clonazepam prescriptions decreased, while the number of seized tablets containing clonazepam increased considerably from 2004 to 2013.",

    "68": "Alcoholic patients suffer from harmful allostatic neuroplastic changes in the brain causing an acute withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of drinking followed by a protracted abstinence syndrome and an increased risk of relapse to heavy drinking. Benzodiazepines have long been the treatment of choice for detoxifying patients and managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsants (NBACs) are increasingly being used both for alcohol withdrawal management and for ongoing outpatient treatment of alcohol dependence, with the goal of either abstinence or harm reduction. This expert narrative review summarizes the scientific basis and clinical evidence supporting the use of NBACs in treating AWS and for reducing harmful drinking patterns. There is less evidence in support of NBAC therapy for AWS, with few placebo-controlled trials. Carbamazepine and gabapentin appear to be the most promising adjunctive treatments for AWS, and they may be useful as monotherapy in select cases, especially in outpatient settings and for the treatment of mild-to-moderate low-risk patients with the AWS. The body of evidence supporting the use of the NBACs for reducing harmful drinking in the outpatient setting is stronger. Topiramate appears to have a robust effect on reducing harmful drinking in alcoholics. Gabapentin is a potentially efficacious treatment for reducing the risk of relapse to harmful drinking patterns in outpatient management of alcoholism. Gabapentin's ease of use, rapid titration, good tolerability, and efficacy in both the withdrawal and chronic phases of treatment make it particularly appealing. In summary, several NBACs appear to be beneficial in treating AWS and alcohol use disorders.", 
    "69": "Among the new psychoactive substances (NPS), most frequently synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) have been found in Europe. These are sold as active compounds in e.\u200ag. so-called \"herbal blends\". When inhaled or ingested, besides intoxication symptoms, as they occur with heavy cannabis use (e.\u200ag., tachycardia, myocardial infarction, confusion, hallucinations, panic attacks, and paranoia), harmful effects (severe agitation, coma, catatonic stupor, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, dyspnoea, seizures, myoclonus, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, acute kidney injury, vomiting, headache, and hypokalemia) arise, which are mostly unusual about cannabis use. In addition, the first cases of addiction and death related to SCBs have been reported. Taking into account the newest literature and using an algorithm with two main criteria (addiction potential, toxicity), the authors made a first attempt to rank the personal health hazard of SCBs in comparison to that of other psychoactive drugs. Accordingly, the relative health hazard of SCBs is found to be somewhat higher than that of cannabis and lower than that of synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\"). However, the toxicity of SCBs, is significantly greater than the toxicity of cannabis, thus being similar to that of synthetic cathinones and benzodiazepines. The addiction potential appears to be lower than that of synthetic cathinones, benzodiazepines, or cannabis. Due to the fluctuation of substances and the availability in internet resources, legislation is facing a serious \"hare-hedgehog\" problem to control the manufacture, trade and possession of SCBs.", 
    "70": "Background Community prescribing of medication to treat psychiatric illness in children is increasing. However, details about medication prescribed at discharge from psychiatric inpatient services for children are scarce. Objectives Characterise the nature of psychotropic medication prescribed on discharge from a children's psychiatric ward over a 15-year period. Method Retrospective analysis of discharge summary letters of all discharges occurring between Jan 1997 to Dec 2012. Results 234 children (152 males and 82 females) were discharged with 117 (50%) prescribed psychotropic medication at discharge. 133 medicines were prescribed (stimulants n = 49, antipsychotics n = 31, antidepressants n = 22, mood stabilisers n = 1, other ADHD medication n = 11, melatonin n = 10, benzodiazepines n = 7, other n = 2). Risperidone was the most popular antipsychotic at a mean daily dose of 1 mg (range 0.25-4 mg). Fifty per cent were given an unlicensed medicine or a licensed drug was used in an unlicensed manner, of which risperidone was the most common (n = 14). Sleep disturbance and tics were most often treated using unlicensed/off label medication (n = 10). Conclusion Psychotropic medication is routinely used in inpatient children's services, with the majority of use confined to stimulants and atypical antipsychotics. Much of the antipsychotic use is for unlicensed indications or at unlicensed doses.", 
    "71": "Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), like olanzapine, exhibit acute metabolic side effects leading to metabolic inflexibility, hyperglycemia, adiposity and diabetes. Understanding how SGAs affect the skeletal muscle transcriptome could elucidate approaches for mitigating these side effects. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were infused intravenously with vehicle or olanzapine for 24h using a dose leading to a mild hyperglycemia. RNA-Seq was performed on gastrocnemius muscle, followed by alignment of the data with the Rat Genome Assembly 5.0. Olanzapine altered expression of 1347 out of 26407 genes. Genes encoding skeletal muscle fiber-type specific sarcomeric, ion channel, glycolytic, O2- and Ca2+-handling, TCA cycle, vascularization and lipid oxidation proteins and pathways, along with NADH shuttles and LDH isoforms were affected. Bioinformatics analyses indicate that olanzapine decreased the expression of slower and more oxidative fiber type genes (e.g., type 1), while up regulating those for the most glycolytic and least metabolically flexible, fast twitch fiber type, IIb. Protein turnover genes, necessary to bring about transition, were also up regulated. Potential upstream regulators were also identified. Olanzapine appears to be rapidly affecting the muscle transcriptome to bring about a change to a fast-glycolytic fiber type. Such fiber types are more susceptible than slow muscle to atrophy, and such transitions are observed in chronic metabolic diseases. Thus these effects could contribute to the altered body composition and metabolic disease olanzapine causes. A potential interventional strategy is implicated because aerobic exercise, in contrast to resistance exercise, can oppose such slow to fast fiber transitions.", 
    "72": "Delirium is a common occurrence in older hospitalised patients, particularly in the setting of surgical intervention and acute illness. Delirium is associated with a number of adverse clinical and social outcomes with higher financial cost and risk of developing dementia, as well as increased likelihood of need for residential care. Current interventions for the prevention of delirium typically involve recognition and amelioration of modifiable risk factors and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose the individual to delirium. A number of pharmacological strategies for delirium prevention have been tested. Antipsychotic medications are used for treatment of agitation in the setting of delirium when other measures have failed, but their efficacy in prevention is limited by study heterogeneity and concerns about tolerability. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease but do not appear to be effective in preventing delirium. Melatonin and melatonin agonists have a rather benign side effect profile and show promise for prevention of delirium in medically unwell individuals. The alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine may be helpful in the intensive care unit setting but intravenous route of administration and need for close clinical supervision limits its use in the wider hospital environment. Other agents such as benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, statins and gabapentin have been suggested but lack evidence to support their role in delirium prevention. To date, there is inconsistent and conflicting data regarding the efficacy of any particular pharmacological agent although some interventions do show promise. Larger, well-designed, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed.",

    "74": "This was a prospective observational study in 6 EDs (August 2009 to April 2013). Adult patients requiring parenteral sedation for acute behavioral disturbance received droperidol 10 mg. If this did not sedate the patient within 15 minutes, further sedation was allowed but droperidol 10 mg was recommended as part of a sedation protocol. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an abnormal QT interval, defined by the at-risk line on the QT nomogram. Secondary outcomes were effectiveness determined by the time to sedation measured on the Sedation Assessment Tool, use of additional sedation, adverse events, and injury to staff or patients.", 
    "75": "There were 1,009 patients with an ECG performed within 2 hours of droperidol administration, with a median dose of 10 mg (interquartile range [IQR]10 to 17.5 mg). Thirteen of the 1,009 patients had an abnormal QT (1.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.7% to 2.3%), but 7 of these had another cause attributed for prolonged QT (methadone, escitalopram, amiodarone, or preexisting). In 1,403 patients sedated with a median total dose of droperidol of 10 mg (IQR 10 to 20 mg), the median time to sedation was 20 minutes (IQR 10 to 30 minutes) and 97% were sedated within 120 minutes. Additional sedation was required for 435 patients (31.0%; 95% confidence interval 28.6% to 33.5%). Adverse events occurred in 70 patients (5%) and oversedation without complications in 109 (8%), the latter more common for patients receiving benzodiazepines as additional sedation (16/109 [15%]). There were no cases of torsades de pointes. Injuries occurred in 34 staff members and 4 patients.",

In the preparation step, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was used. Extracts were analyzed by means of capillary electrophoresis with mass spectrometry time-of-flight detection (CE-TOF-MS). In the validation study of the MAE/CE-TOF-MS analytical method, three concentration levels of analytes (10, 100 and 250 ng/mL for serum and 0.2, 2.2 and 5.6 ng/mL for hair) were taken into account. Such parameters as limit of detection (0.4-1.2 ng/mL for serum, 6.0-23.0 pg/mg for hair), limit of quantification (1.3-4.1 ng/mL for serum, 20.0-77.0 pg/mg for hair), precision (3.0-11.3% for serum, 2.4-14.2% for hair), accuracy of the assay (RE) (-8.0 to 12.0% for serum, -8.0 to 11.0% for hair), recovery (88.6-113.4% for serum, 86.1-107.4% for hair) and matrix effects (87.9-110.7% for serum, 85.1-108.4% for hair) were calculated for the studied compounds. Then, the MAE/CE-TOF-MS method was successfully applied to the analysis of hair samples taken from patients treated with benzodiazepines.",

    "83": "Among numerous side effects of antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics), one of the leading problems is a significant weight gain caused by disturbances in energy homeostasis. The hypothalamus is considered an important target for neuroleptics and contains some neuronal circuits responsible for food intake regulation, so we decided to study which hypothalamic signaling pathways connected with energy balance control are modified by antipsychotic drugs of different generations. We created an expression profile of different neuropeptides after single-dose and chronic neuroleptic administration. Experiments were carried out on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats injected intraperitoneally for 1 day or for 28 days by three neuroleptics: olanzapine, chlorpromazine and haloperidol. Hypothalami were isolated in order to perform PCR reactions and also whole brains were sliced for immunohistochemical analysis. We assessed the expression of orexigenic/anorexigenic neuropeptides and their receptors--neuropeptide Y (NPY), NPY receptor type 1 (Y1R), preproorexin (PPOX), orexin A, orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) and 2 (OX2R), nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2), nesfatin-1, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), alpha-melanotropin (\u03b1-MSH) and melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R)--both on the mRNA and protein levels. We have shown that antipsychotics of different generations administered chronically have the ability to upregulate PPOX, orexin A and Y1R expression with little or no effect on orexigenic receptors (OX1R, OX2R) and NPY. Interestingly, antipsychotics also increased the level of some anorexigenic factors (POMC, \u03b1-MSH and MC4R), but at the same time strongly downregulated NUCB2 and nesfatin-1 signaling--a newly discovered neuropeptide known as a food-intake inhibiting factor. Our results may contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms responsible for antipsychotics' side effects. They also underline the complex nature of interactions between classical monoamine receptors and hypothalamic peptidergic pathways, which has potential clinical applications.", 
    "84": "Co-administration of opioids with benzodiazepines is very common around the world. A semi-automated method was developed for the determination of four opioids and two benzodiazepines as well as their metabolites (including glucuronide metabolites) in human urine, based on on-line column-switching-solid-phase extraction (CS-SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The CS-SPE was performed by loading 200\u03bcL of urine sample to an Oasis HLB cartridge. Detection was achieved using a LC-MS/MS system equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI). For unequivocal identification and confirmation, two selected reaction monitoring transitions were registered for each compound, and no co-elution of interferences was observed at the expected retention time. Significant ion suppressions were observed for most analytes during chromatographic runs, but isotope-labeled internal standards (ISs) were used and found to be useful to compensate for the determination error caused by the matrix effect. The assay's linearity ranged from 1-20ng/mL to 800-1000ng/mL for 23 compounds, except for lorazepam (LOR), whose linearity was in the range of 1-100ng/mL. This method showed to be precise and accurate. The relative standard deviation (RSD) % values of within-run precision, between-run precision and total precision were not greater than 10.4% (n=3), 12.9% (n=5) and 15.1% (n=15), respectively. Accuracy values were in the range of 87.5-110%. Limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.2ng/mL to 5ng/mL, and limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 1ng/mL to 20ng/mL. The method was applied to the assay of 12 samples from forensic cases, which exemplified the co-administration of benzodiazepines (BZDs) by some heroin abusers. This method was of high sensitivity, selectivity and reliability, minimum sample manipulation, semi-automation, and fairly high throughput (analysis time per sample was 20min). The method developed will be useful for the detection of co-administrated drugs and the study of the interactions of BDZs with opioids.",

The main factors associated with the START-listed PPO was a non-community dwelling origin (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.0), and multimorbidity (OR1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.1).", 
    "97": "Prescribed medicines and PIM and PPO prevalence were high among patients 85\u00a0years and over. Benzodiazepine use in those who are prone to falls and omission of calcium and vitamin D in those with osteoporosis were the most frequent PIM and PPO, respectively. Factors associated with PIM and PPO differed with polypharmacy being the most important factor associated with PIM.", 
    "98": "Randomized controlled trials suggest clinical outcomes may be improved with dexmedetomidine as compared with benzodiazepines; however, further study and validation are needed.

The before phase included consecutive patients admitted between 1 April 2011 and 31 August 31 2011. Subsequently, the protocol was modified to minimize use of benzodiazepines in favor of early dexmedetomidine through a multidisciplinary approach, and staff education was provided. The after phase included consecutive eligible patients between 1 May 2012 and 31 October 2012.", 
    "100": "A total of 199 patients were included, with 97 patients in the before phase and 102 in the after phase. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. Use of midazolam as initial sedation (58% versus 27%, P <0.0001) or at any point during the ICU stay (76% versus 48%, P <0.0001) was significantly reduced in the after phase. Dexmedetomidine use as initial sedation (2% versus 39%, P <0.0001) or at any point during the ICU stay (39% versus 82%, P <0.0001) significantly increased. Both the prevalence (81% versus 93%, P =0.013) and median percentage of days with delirium (55% (interquartile range (IQR), 18 to 83) versus 71% (IQR, 45 to 100), P =0.001) were increased in the after phase. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly reduced in the after phase (110 (IQR, 59 to 192) hours versus 74.5 (IQR, 42 to 148) hours, P =0.029), and significantly fewer patients required tracheostomy (20% versus 9%, P =0.040).

Further experiments demonstrated that oxygen exposure and contact with polyvinylchloride tubing were respectively responsible for 70% and 85% of propofol loss after 45\u00a0minutes. Midazolam concentration also rapidly decreased in the ECMO circuit, with only 54% and 11% of baseline concentration being detected at 30\u00a0minutes and 24\u00a0hours respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.01 versus control). Alternatively, cyclosporine concentration remained stable for the five first hours, then decreased to 78% and 73% of the baseline value after 24\u00a0hours and 48\u00a0hours, (P\u2009=\u20090.35 versus control). Lastly, vancomycin concentration remained stable in the ECMO circuit for the 48-hour experimental protocol.", 
    "105": "We observed important losses of propofol and midazolam, while cyclosporine concentration decreased slowly and moderately, and vancomycin concentration remained unchanged in the ex-vivo ECMO circuit primed with whole human blood. These data might help intensive care unit physicians planning clinical trials with a final objective to better adapt doses of these drugs while treating critically ill ECMO patients.", 
    "106": "The salience network (SN), a set of brain regions composed of the anterior fronto-insular cortex (aFI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is usually involved in interoception, self-regulating, and action selection. Accumulating evidence indicates that dysfunctions in this network are associated with various pathophysiological deficits in both schizophrenia and eating disorders, stemming mainly from dysfunctional information processing of internal or external stimuli. In addition, the metabolic side effects of some antipsychotics (APs), as well as their pharmacological mechanisms of action, also suggest a link between the functional and neurophysiological changes in the brain in both schizophrenia and in eating disorders. Nevertheless, there is still a knowledge gap in explicitly and directly linking the metabolic side effects associated with AP treatment with the dysfunction in SN associated with processing of food-related information in schizophrenia. Here we provide neuroimaging evidence for such a link, by presenting data on a group of schizophrenia patients who followed 16 weeks of olanzapine treatment and undertook a passive viewing task while their brain activity was recorded. In response to food-related dynamic stimuli (video clips), we observed a decreased activity in SN (aFI and ACC) after the treatment, which also correlated with ghrelin plasma concentration and a measure of dietary restraint. Taken together with past findings regarding the role of SN in both schizophrenia and eating disorders, our results suggest that enhancing the reactivity in the SN has the potential to be a treatment strategy in people with anorexia nervosa.",

Quebec showed the highest rate of unemployment (21%) and British Columbia had the greatest percentage of patients on disability (15%). Employed and unemployed groups were similar based on clinical characteristics; however, unemployed people may have higher age, prevalence of medical comorbidity, and greater likelihood of receiving a benzodiazepine. Increased disability rates were associated with history of childhood abuse, duration of current major depressive episode, comorbidity, benzodiazepine use, as well as greater depression and anxiety severity. The unemployed-disability groups had greater somatic symptoms and anhedonia. In keeping with this, anhedonia was the strongest predictor of disability. Absenteeism was also high across both studies.",

    "114": "A total of 338 PDSS events were identified. Of these, 91% occurred within 1 hour of injection, and 52% of these occurred within 15 minutes. None of the PDSS events in this analysis were fatal, and most resolved within 72 hours. The most common symptoms (occurring in >30% of cases) were sedation (61%), confusion (56%), dysarthria (54%), somnolence (46%), dizziness (45%) and disorientation (35%). Overall, PDSS occurred with approximately 0.07% of injections and in 0.46-1.03% of patients (reporting and incidence rates from spontaneous reports and post-marketing safety studies, respectively).",

    "116": "The MEK/ERK pathways are critical for controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we show that the MEK5/ERK5 pathway participates in osteoclast differentiation. ERK5 was activated by M-CSF, which is one of the essential factors in osteoclast differentiation. Inhibition of MEK5 by BIX02189 or inhibition of ERK5 by XMD 8-92 blocked osteoclast differentiation. MEK5 knockdown inhibited osteoclast differentiation. RAW264.7D clone cells, which are monocytic cells, differentiate into osteoclasts after stimulation with sRANKL. ERK5 was activated without any stimulation in these cells. Inhibition of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway by the inhibitors also blocked the differentiation of RAW264.7D cells into osteoclasts. Moreover, expression of the transcription factor c-Fos, which is indispensable for osteoclast differentiation, was inhibited by treatment with MEK5 or ERK5 inhibitors. Therefore, activation of ERK5 is required for the induction of c-Fos. These events were confirmed in experiments using M-CSF-dependent bone marrow macrophages. Taken together, the present results show that activation of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway with M-CSF is required for osteoclast differentiation, which may induce differentiation through the induction of c-Fos.", 
    "117": "Classically, ligands of GPCRs have been classified primarily upon their affinity and efficacy to activate a signal transduction pathway. Recent reports indicate that the efficacy of a particular ligand can vary depending on the receptor-mediated response measured (e.g. activating G proteins, other downstream responses, internalization). Previously, we reported that inverse agonists induce both homo- and heterologous desensitization, similar to agonist stimulation, at the Gs -coupled 5-HT7 receptor. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether different inverse agonists at the 5-HT7 receptor also induce internalization and/or degradation of 5-HT7 receptors.", 
    "118": "HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT7(a, b or d) receptors were pre-incubated with 5-HT, clozapine, olanzapine, mesulergine or SB269970 and their effects upon receptor density, AC activity, internalization, recruitment of \u03b2-arrestins and lysosomal trafficking were measured.", 
    "119": "The agonist 5-HT and three out of four inverse agonists tested increased internalization independently of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Among these, only the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine promoted lysosomal sorting and reduced 5-HT7 receptor density (\u223c60% reduction within 24\u2009h). Inhibition of lysosomal degradation with chloroquine blocked the clozapine- and olanzapine-induced down-regulation of 5-HT7 receptors. Incubation with SB269970 decreased both 5-HT7(b) constitutive internalization and receptor density but increased 5-HT7(d) receptor density, indicating differential ligand regulation among the 5-HT7 splice variants.",

Depressive and anxiety disorders for the preceding 12-month period were ascertained by clinical interview. Current medication use and falls history were self-reported. Participants were classified as fallers if they had fallen to the ground at least twice during the same 12-month period. Anthropometry, demographic, medical and lifestyle factors were determined. Logistic regression was used to test the associations, after adjusting for potential confounders.",

Those meeting criteria for depression within the past 12 months had a 2.4-fold increased odds of falling (unadjusted OR\u2009=\u20092.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.5). Adjustment for age and mobility strengthened the relationship (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20092.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.2) between depression and falling, with results remaining unchanged following further adjustment for psychotropic medication use (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20092.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.6). In contrast, past (prior to 12-month) depression were not associated with falls. No association was observed between anxiety and falls risk.

    "125": "Topotecan (TPT) is a therapeutic option for women with platinum-resistant or -refractory ovarian cancer. However, the dose-limiting toxicity of TPT is myelosuppression. This led us to seek a combination treatment to augment TPT anti-cancer activity in a cancer-targeted manner. Ovarian serous cancers, a major subtype, show dysregulated DNA repair pathway and often display a high level of CHEK1 (CHK1), a cell cycle regulator and DNA damage sensor. CHEK1 inhibitors are a novel approach to treatment, and have been used as single agents or in combination chemotherapy in many cancers.", 
    "126": "We evaluated the cellular effects of TPT in a panel of high grade serous (HGS) and non-HGS ovarian cancer cells. We then determined IC50s of TPT in the absence and presence of CHEK1 inhibitor, PF477736. Synergism between TPT and PF477736 was calculated based on cellular viability assays. Cytotoxic effect of the combined treatment was compared with apoptotic activities by Caspase3/7 activity assay and Western blotting of cleaved-PARP1 and \u03b3H2AX.", 
    "127": "Non-HGS ovarian cancer cells were generally more sensitive to TPT treatment compared to HGS ovarian cancer cells. When combined with CHEK1 inhibitor, TPT potently and synergistically inhibited the proliferation of HGS ovarian cancer cells. This dramatic synergism in cellular toxicity was consistent with increases in markers of apoptosis.", 
    "128": "Our findings suggest that the addition of CHEK1 inhibitor increases the response of ovarian cancer cells to TPT. Furthermore, reduced dosages of both drugs achieved maximal cytotoxic effects by combining TPT with CHEK1 inhibitor. This strategy would potentially minimize side effects of the drugs for extended clinical benefit.", 
    "129": "We offer some perspectives and commentary on the sedation of obese patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).", 
    "130": "Sedation in morbidly obese patients should conform to the same broad principles now current in ICU practice. These include a general presumption against benzodiazepines as first-line agents. Opioids should be avoided in any situation where spontaneous breathing is required. Remifentanil is the preferred agent where continuous stable opioid levels using an infusion are required, because of its lack of context-sensitive accumulation. Volatile anaesthetics may be an option for the same reason but there are no substantial, controlled demonstrations of effectiveness/safety in short-term use in the ICU setting. Propofol is a valuable resource in the morbidly obese patients but the duration of continuous sedation should not exceed 6\u00a0days, in order to avoid propofol infusion syndrome. Alpha-2 agonists offer a range of theoretically positive features for the sedation of morbidly obese patients, but at present there is a lack of pharmacokinetic data and a critical mass of high-grade clinical data. Dexmedetomidine has the attraction of not causing respiratory depression or obstructive breathing during sedation and its sympatholytic effects should help deliver stable blood pressure and heart rate. Ketamine has a poor tolerability profile in adults so its use in the ICU context is largely confined to paediatrics.",

In patients with aSAH, sedation is used as a neuroprotective measure in order to secure adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Compared with the use of an endotracheal tube, a tracheotomy has the advantage of securing the airway at a much lower level of distress, and aSAH patients can often be awakened more rapidly. Little is known about the impact of tracheotomy on the consumption of sedative/analgesic and vasoactive drugs and the maintenance of CPP within defined limits in aSAH patients.", 
    "133": "We conducted an observational study of aSAH patients who underwent percutaneous tracheotomy. A prospective registry of patient data was supplemented with retrospective retrievals from medical records. Sedative, analgesic and vasoactive drug doses were registered for 3\u00a0days prior to and after percutaneous tracheotomy, respectively. Blood pressure, CPP, and the mode of mechanical ventilation were registered 24\u00a0h prior to and after tracheotomy.", 
    "134": "Between January 2001 and June 2009, 902 aSAH patients were admitted to our hospital; 74 (8%) were deeply comatose/dying upon arrival. The ruptured aneurysm was repaired in 828 patients (surgical repair 50%) and percutaneous tracheotomy was performed 182 times in 178 patients (59 men and 119 women). This subpopulation (178 of 828 patients) was significantly older (56 vs. 53\u00a0years) and presented with a more severe Hunt & Hess grade (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Percutaneous tracheotomy caused a marked decline in mean daily consumption of the analgesics/sedatives fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol, as well as the vasoactive drugs noradrenaline and dopamine. These declines were statistically and clinically significant. The mean CPP was 76\u00a0mmHg (SD 8.6) the day before and 79\u00a0mmHg (SD 9.6) 24\u00a0h after percutaneous tracheotomy.

    "136": "Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a potent convulsant GABAA receptor blocker. Mice receiving a lethal dose of TETS (0.15 mg/kg i.p.) are rescued from death by a high dose of diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) administered shortly after the second clonic seizure (\u223c20 min post-TETS). However, this high dose of diazepam significantly impairs blood pressure and mobility, and does not prevent TETS-induced neuroinflammation in the brain. We previously demonstrated that TETS alters synchronous Ca(2+) oscillations in primary mouse hippocampal neuronal cell cultures and that pretreatment with the combination of diazepam and allopregnanolone at concentrations having negligible effects individually prevents TETS effects on intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. Here, we show that treatment with diazepam and allopregnanolone (0.1 \u03bcM) 20 min after TETS challenge normalizes synchronous Ca(2+) oscillations when added in combination but not when added singly. Similarly, doses (0.03-0.1 mg/kg i.p.) of diazepam and allopregnanolone that provide minimal protection when administered singly to TETS intoxicated mice increase survival from 10% to 90% when given in combination either 10 min prior to TETS or following the second clonic seizure. This therapeutic combination has negligible effects on blood pressure or mobility. Combined treatment with diazepam and allopregnanolone also decreases TETS-induced microglial activation. Diazepam and allopregnanolone have distinct actions as positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors that in combination enhance survival and mitigate neuropathology following TETS intoxication without the adverse side effects associated with high dose benzodiazepines. Combination therapy with a benzodiazepine and neurosteroid represents a novel neurotherapeutic strategy with potentially broad application.",

These include steroidogenesis, apoptosis, inflammation, neurological disease and cancer, resulting in the use of TSPO as a biomarker and its potential as a drug target. Despite more than 30 years of study, the precise function of TSPO remains elusive. A recent breakthrough in determining the high-resolution crystal structures of bacterial homologs of mitochondrial TSPO provides new insight into the structural and functional properties at a molecular level and new opportunities for investigating the significance of this ancient and highly conserved protein family.

All volunteers received an oral dose of 5\u2009mg of midazolam alone or after 6 days of 150\u2009mg daily intravenous infusion of lanicemine. Lanicemine reached a plasma Cmax of 1.51\u2009\u03bcg/mL after 150\u2009mg daily dosing to steady state. The geometric mean CL, Vss, and t1/2 of lanicemine were 8.1 L/h, 122.0 L, and 10.4 hours, respectively. The geometric least-squares mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals for midazolam AUC0- \u221e , and Cmax were within the 80% to 125% limits when lanicemine plus midazolam treatment was compared with midazolam alone, demonstrating that daily dosing with 150\u2009mg of lanicemine for 6 days had no effect on CYP3A activity. Comprehensive physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling using in vitro and in silico findings also indicated lanicemine would have little impact on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A substrate, such as midazolam. In addition, lanicemine and midazolam administered alone or in combination were generally safe and well tolerated.",

Approximately 4,000 such deaths were documented in 1999, increasing to 16,235 in 2013, reflecting a nearly quadrupled death rate from 1.4 to 5.1 deaths per 100,000. To investigate this increase in New York state, trends in poisoning deaths involving opioid analgesics from 2003 to 2012 were examined. Data sources used were New York state vital statistics multiple-cause-of-death data, consisting of data from both the New York City (NYC)* and non-NYC reporting jurisdictions, as well as statewide Medicaid enrollment data. Deaths involving opioid analgesics increased both in number and as a percentage of all drug poisoning deaths, and rates were highest among men, whites, persons aged 45-64 years, persons residing outside of NYC, and Medicaid enrollees. The analysis found that, in 2012, 70.7% of deaths involving opioid analgesics also involved at least one other drug, most frequently a benzodiazepine. These results underscore the potential to mitigate the trend of increasing opioid analgesic-related mortality through initiatives such as New York state's Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing (I-STOP) law,\u2020 which took effect on August 27, 2013.

No studies measured quality of life or participant well-being, which was the primary outcome of the review. Five studies measured symptom control, using four different methods, so pooling was not possible. The results demonstrated that despite sedation, delirium and dyspnoea were still troublesome symptoms in these people in the last few days of life. Control of other symptoms appeared to be similar in sedated and non-sedated people. Only one study measured unintended adverse effects of sedative drugs and found no major events; however, four of 70 participants appeared to have drug-induced delirium. The study noticed no respiratory suppression. Thirteen of the 14 studies measured survival time from admission or referral to death, and all demonstrated no statistically significant difference between sedated and non-sedated groups.",

In our present study, we investigate the possibilities of marketed antiepileptic drugs in a different manner to improve the present situation in TLE. Molecular docking simulation study and various open source computational tools were used to perform the study. AutoDock 4.2 MGL tools, Pymol visualize tools, Patch dock server, and Swarm Dock servers (protein-protein docking) were used to perform the molecular modeling.

The obtained molecular docking models (Caspase 3, Procaspase 8, and Fas-associated death domain [FADD]) with selected compounds (Clonazepam, Clobazepam, and Retigabine) showed promising trio blocking event of FADD, Caspase 3, and Procaspase 8 (-6.66 kcal, -8.1 kcal, 6.46 kcal) by Clonazepam respectively. Protein-protein interaction study (Swarm Dock, Patch Dock server) indicated promising results that helped to establish our hypothesis. Toxtree showed a quantitative structure toxicity relationship report that helps to clarify the toxicity of the selected compounds.

In comparing HLM incubations with and without a prior 30-min exposure to telaprevir, a respective 4- and 11-fold reduction in IC50 was observed with midazolam and tacrolimus as substrates. This time-dependent inhibition was shown to be NADPH-dependent. Upon dilution of microsomes following pre-incubation with telaprevir, time-dependent inhibition of midazolam metabolism was completely reversed, whereas partial reversal occurred with tacrolimus.",

All synthesized 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against C. neoformans, C. neoformans clinical isolates, C. albicans, E. coli and S. aureus. The bioactive assay results revealed that most of the 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives exhibited considerable potency against all of the tested strains. In particular, compounds 1v and 1w (MIC: 2-6 \u03bcg mL(-1), MFC: 10-14 \u03bcg mL(-1)) exhibited excellent antifungal activity and were found to be 32-64 and 9-12.8 times more potent than the reference drugs against C. neoformans, respectively. Moreover, compound (MIC: 40 \u03bcg mL(-1)) displayed equipotent antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus compared to the reference drugs. The most potent of the synthesized compounds 1v and 1w were further studied by evaluating their cytotoxicities, and the results showed that they had relatively low level cytotoxicity for BV2 cell. A preliminary study of the structure-activity relationship revealed that substituents in the phenyl ring and the thiophene ring had a great effect on the antimicrobial activity of these compounds. In addition, the thiazole ring at C2 may be a pharmacophore of these compounds and COOC2H5 group at C3 is the best substituent for the maintenance of antimicrobial activities at low concentrations (1.5625 \u03bcg per disc).",

We believe in this way, no patient with cancer will live with uncontrolled pain. Access to adjuvant drugs should be easy in order to achieve success in pain management. We believe that expert algology physicians who treat pain should easily prescribe adjuvant drugs.",

    "208": "Agonists at the benzodiazepine-binding site of GABAA receptors (BDZs) enhance synaptic inhibition through four subtypes (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b15) of GABAA receptors (GABAAR). When applied to the spinal cord, they alleviate pathological pain; however, insufficient efficacy after systemic administration and undesired effects preclude their use in routine pain therapy. Previous work suggested that subtype-selective drugs might allow separating desired antihyperalgesia from unwanted effects, but the lack of selective agents has hitherto prevented systematic analyses. Here we use four lines of triple GABAAR point-mutated mice, which express only one benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAAR subtype at a time, to show that targeting only \u03b12GABAARs achieves strong antihyperalgesia and reduced side effects (that is, no sedation, motor impairment and tolerance development). Additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses in these mice explain why clinically relevant antihyperalgesia cannot be achieved with nonselective BDZs. These findings should foster the development of innovative subtype-selective BDZs for novel indications such as chronic pain.", 
    "209": "Paroxysmal dyskinesia represents a group of uncommon movement disorders that are characterized by episodes of abnormal movements arising from a baseline of normal or nearly normal movement. Recent advances in the genetics of these disorders have helped provide some unification of classification schemes and better understanding. However, the approach to treatment continues to be based on the phenotype more than the genotype. The treatment approach is primarily based on the factors that precipitate the episodes of abnormal movements. For paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) in which the spells are triggered by sudden movement, treatment with anticonvulsants that target voltage-sensitive sodium channels (e.g., carbamazepine or phenytoin) is highly effective. For paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), treatment with benzodiazepines is effective in many patients. PNKD episodes are often precipitated by caffeine, ethanol, or sleep deprivation, and lifestyle modifications are often helpful. Paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (PED) is less likely to respond to medications, but the ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet may provide benefit. As more knowledge is gained about the underlying biology of these disorders, additional treatments may emerge.",

We distinguish two types of disease-mongering according to the way they exploit the definition of the trial population for marketing purposes. We argue that behind these two forms of disease-mongering there are two well-known problems in the statistical methodology of clinical trials (the reference class problem and the distinction between statistical and clinical significance). Overcoming them is far from simple.", 
    "211": "The combination of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and atypical antipsychotic drugs shows better therapeutic efficacy than SSRI monotherapy in the treatment of depression. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the augmenting effects of olanzapine are not fully understood. Here, we report that olanzapine enhances the SSRI-induced increase in extracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels and antidepressant-like effects by inhibiting GABAergic neurons through 5-HT6 receptor antagonism in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). In organotypic raphe slice cultures, treatment with olanzapine (1-100 \u03bcM) enhanced the increase in extracellular 5-HT levels in the presence of fluoxetine (10 \u03bcM) or citalopram (1 \u03bcM). The enhancing effect of olanzapine was not further augmented by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that olanzapine (50 \u03bcM) decreased the firing frequency of GABAergic neurons in acute DRN slices. Among many serotonergic agents, the 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB399885 (1-100 \u03bcM) mimicked the effects of olanzapine by enhancing the SSRI-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT levels, which was not further augmented by bicuculline or olanzapine. SB399885 (50 \u03bcM) also decreased the firing frequency of GABAergic neurons in the DRN. In addition, an intraperitoneal administration of SB399885 (10 mg/kg) to mice significantly enhanced the antidepressant-like effect of a subeffective dose of citalopram (3 mg/kg) in the tail-suspension test. These results suggest that olanzapine decreases local inhibitory GABAergic tone in the DRN through antagonism of 5-HT6 receptors, thereby increasing the activity of at least part of serotonergic neurons, which may contribute to the augmentation of the efficacy of SSRIs.",

To date, small molecule agonists have been developed, but have failed to demonstrate adequate efficacy in clinical trials, and concerns about side effects and potential toxicity have limited further development of full agonists. The use of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) without intrinsic agonist activity that are active only for a brief period of time after a meal might represent a safer alternative. Here, we propose a possible novel strategy to develop such compounds by modifying the agonist 'trigger' of an existing small molecule agonist. We have studied analogues of the 1,5-benzodiazepine agonist, GI181771X, in which the N1-isopropyl agonist 'trigger' was modified. While agonist activity was greatly reduced in these compounds, they acted as negative, rather than positive modulators. The parent drug was also found to exhibit no positive modulation of CCK action. Receptor structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that the mode of docking these derivatives was distinct from that of the parent compound, perhaps explaining their action as negative allosteric modulators. We conclude that this outcome is likely characteristic of the parental agonist, and that this strategy may be more successfully utilized with a parental ago-PAM, possessing intrinsic positive modulatory activity.", 
    "217": "Ursolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that possesses several biological and neuropharmacological effects including antidepressant-like activity. Anxiety disorders represent common and disability psychiatric conditions that are often associated with depressive symptoms. This work investigated the anxiolytic-like effects of ursolic acid administration in different behavioral paradigms that evaluate anxiety in mice: open field test, elevated plus maze test, light/dark box test and marble burying test. To this end, mice were administered with ursolic acid (0.1, 1 and 10mg/kg, p.o.) or diazepam (2mg/kg, p.o.), positive control, and submitted to the behavioral tests. The results show that ursolic acid (10mg/kg) elicited an anxiolytic-like effect observed by the increased total time in the center and decreased number of rearings responses in the open field test and an increased percentage of entries and total time spent in the open arms of elevated plus maze, similarly to diazepam. No significant effects of ursolic acid were shown in the light/dark box and marble burying test. These data indicate that ursolic acid exhibits anxiolytic-like effects in the open field and elevated plus maze test, but not in the light/dark box and marble burying test, showing the relevance of testing several behavioral paradigms in the evaluation of anxiolytic-like actions. Of note, the results extend the understanding on the effects of ursolic acid in the central nervous system and suggest that it may be a novel approach for the management of anxiety-related disorders.",

The mean retention time, standard deviation, flow rate, and repeatability of analytical results were compared by using 2 methods. Routine runtimes in HPLC and UHPLC took 40 and 15 minutes, respectively. Changes in mobile phase composition of the 2 methods were not required. Flow rate and solvent consumption in UHPLC decreased. Diazepam and flurazepam were detected more frequently in biological samples. In UHPLC, small particle size and short length of column cause effective separation of BZs in a very short time. Reduced flow rate, solvent consumption, and injection volume cause more efficiency and less analysis costs. Thus, in the detection of BZs, UHPLC is an accurate, sensitive, and fast method with less cost of analysis.",

Therefore, this study sought to quantify the acini (N) in parotid glands of Wistar rats treated chronically with two BZDs (Lorazepam and Midazolan) and to verify the action of the pilocarpine when administered with these drugs. Ninety male Wistar rats were distributed in 9 groups according to the administration of: a) S30 - saline solution for 30 days; b) S60 - saline solution for 60 days; c) P60 - pilocarpine for 60 days; d) L30 - Lorazepam for 30 days; e) M30 - Midozolam for 30 days; f) LS60 - Lorazepam for 60 days and, after this period, 30 more days of saline solution; g) MS60 - Midazolam for 30 days and, after this period, 30 more days of saline solution; h) LP60 - Lorazepam and Pilocarpine for 60 days; i) MP60 - Midazolam and Pilocarpine for 60 days. A surgery was performed on the animals to remove the glands. After this, histological cuts were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, from which the N was quantified. The ANOVA and Games-Howell tests were used for statistical analysis. The L30 and M30 groups presented less N than did the S30 group (p<0.05). The LS60, MS60, and LP60 groups presented less N than did the S60 and P60 groups (p<0.05). No differences could be observed between the MP60 and S60 groups. The chronic administration of Midazolam and Lorazepam reduced acini, which may well have collaborated in the reduction of salivary flow previously verified. The association of Midazolam with Pilocarpine led to the reestablishment of acinar cells, which may have favored the restoration of the salivary flow formerly shown.",

Her initial symptoms of mood fluctuation and insomnia were noticed while hospitalised for the third cycle, and became more severe. She was very irritable, highly distracted and forgetful. She exhibited flights of ideas and hyperactivity, including compulsive shopping. She also had paranoid ideations, auditory hallucinations, and thoughts of being wealthy and close to the prime minister. She was not depressed. She was diagnosed with axis I psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. The incremental dosage of olanzapine from 5 to 20 mg/day was given but failed to control her psychotic symptoms during the first week, and was therefore switched to risperidone. At 4 mg/day, her symptoms were dramatically controlled. This novel evidence suggests the rare possibility of an association between chemotherapy and the development of psychotic attacks.", 
    "224": "In the new classification of the DSM-V, catatonia is individualized as a disease of its own. It is defined by presence of at least two out of five criteria: motor immobility, negativism, echolalia or echopraxia, sterile motor activity, atypical movements. The priority is to look first for organic causes: the main ones are neurologic disorders. Intoxication may also be found (illegal drugs or medication), and the role of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in catatonia remains unclear. Among the psychiatric causes, first come bipolar disorders, especially mania; then schizophrenia. Idiopathic forms can also be observed. Epidemiological work on catatonia show highly variable results, highlighting a possible underestimation of the diagnosis. Among the differential diagnoses, which are rare motor syndromes, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome are also discussed. The diagnosis of catatonia is clinical and can be obtained using standardized diagnostic scales. The use of zolpidem provides both a diagnostic and therapeutic guidance for the degree of response to drug treatment. The physiopathological hypotheses describe an intracerebral GABAergic, dopaminergic and glutamatergic dysfunction in catatonic patients. The complete mechanisms are still partly unknown. Benzodiazepines are the first treatment of choice. Electroconvulsive therapy is used secondarily or in severe cases. First-generation antipsychotics are prohibited, at the risk of worsening the catatonia in becoming malignant and lethal. The renewed interest in the catatonic syndrome during the past recent years has expanded research on the mechanisms of this syndrome and opened the way to new therapeutic options. The latest works tend to modulate the strict prohibition of antipsychotic in a catatonic patient.",

Unfortunately data regarding the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of psychotherapeutic agents in ESRD remain rather limited. Of the agents available, it appears that the most data in this patient group were found with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines. Given the small number of patients enrolled in many of the studies and the wide inter-individual variability, it was difficult to interpret the significance of results in many instances.

    "252": "Morphine and midazolam in dosages that produce sedation are associated with increased incidence of pharyngeal dysfunction and discoordinated breathing and swallowing, a combination impairing airway protection and potentially increasing the risk for pulmonary aspirations.", 
    "253": "Sedative and analgesic medications have been used routinely for decades to provide patient comfort, reduce procedure time, and improve examination quality during colonoscopy.",

    "256": "The study population was made up of patients undergoing a total of 1,385,436 colonoscopies.", 
    "257": "Colonoscopy without any intervention or with mucosal biopsy, polypectomy, various means of hemostasis, luminal dilation, stent placement, or ablation.", 
    "258": "Dose of midazolam, diazepam, fentanyl, meperidine, diphenhydramine, promethazine, and propofol used for sedation during colonoscopy.", 
    "259": "During the past 14 years, midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol have become the most commonly used sedatives for colonoscopy. Except for benzodiazepines, which were dosed higher in women than men, equal doses of sedation were given to female and male patients. White patients were given higher doses than other ethnic groups undergoing sedation for colonoscopy. Except for histamine-1 receptor antagonists, all sedative medications were given at lower doses to patients with increasing age. The dose of sedatives was higher in colonoscopies associated with procedural interventions or of long duration.", 
    "260": "Potential for incomplete or incorrect documentation in the database.", 
    "261": "The findings reflect on colonoscopy practice in the United States during the last 14 years and provide an incentive for future research on how sex and ethnicity influence sedation practices.", 
    "262": "To assess the efficacy of midazolam for anxiety control in third molar extraction surgery.", 
    "263": "Electronic retrievals were conducted in Medline (via PubMed, 1950-2013.12), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), Embase (via OVID 1974-2013.12), and the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE). The bibliographies of relevant clinical trials were also checked. Randomized controlled trials satisfying the inclusion criteria were evaluated, with data extraction done independently by two well-trained investigators. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consultation with a third member of the review team.", 
    "264": "Ten studies were included, but meta-analysis could not be conducted because of the significant differences among articles. All but one article demonstrated that midazolam could relieve anxiety. One article demonstrated that propofol offered superior anxiolysis, with more rapid recovery than with midazolam. Compared with lorazepam and diazepam, midazolam did not distinctly dominate in its sedative effect, but was safer. Two articles used midazolam in multidrug intravenous sedation and proved it to be more effective than midazolam alone.", 
    "265": "It was found, by comparison and analysis, that midazolam might be effective for use for anxiety control during third molar extraction and can be safely administered by a dedicated staff member. It can also be used with other drugs to obtain better sedative effects, but the patient's respiratory function must be monitored closely, because multidrug sedation is also more risky.", 
    "266": "Polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use among older adults contribute to adverse drug reactions, falls, cognitive impairment, noncompliance, hospitalization and mortality. While deprescribing - tapering, reducing or stopping a medication - is feasible and relatively safe, clinicians find it difficult to carry out. Deprescribing guidelines would facilitate this process. The aim of this paper is to identify and prioritize medication classes where evidence-based deprescribing guidelines would be of benefit to clinicians. A modified Delphi approach included a literature review to identify potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly, an expert panel to develop survey content and three survey rounds to seek consensus on priorities. Panel participants included three pharmacists, two family physicians and one social scientist. Sixty-five Canadian geriatrics experts (36 pharmacists, 19 physicians and 10 nurse practitioners) participated in the survey. Twenty-nine drugs/drug classes were included in the first survey with 14 reaching the required (\u2265 70%) level of consensus, and 2 new drug classes added from qualitative comments. Fifty-three participants completed round two, and 47 participants completed round three. The final five priorities were benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, statins, tricyclic antidepressants, and proton pump inhibitors; nine other drug classes were also identified as being in need of evidence-based deprescribing guidelines. The Delphi consensus process identified five priority drug classes for which expert clinicians felt guidance is needed for deprescribing. The classes of drugs that emerged strongly from the rankings dealt with mental health, cardiovascular, gastroenterological, and neurological conditions. The results suggest that deprescribing and overtreatment occurs through the full spectrum of primary care, and that evidence-based deprescribing guidelines are a priority in the care of the elderly."
