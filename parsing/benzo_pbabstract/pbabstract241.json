    "2": "Fifty-five outpatients with PD, who participated in a placebo-controlled drug trial of the efficacy of alprazolam and imipramine 15 years ago were reassessed with the same instruments used in the original study.", 
    "3": "Complete recovery (no panic attacks and no longer on medication during the last 10 years) was seen in 18% of patients, and an additional 13% recovered but were still on medication. Fifty-one percent experienced recurrent anxiety attacks whereas 18% still met diagnostic criteria for PD. The incidence of agoraphobia decreased from 69% to 20%. Patients with agoraphobia at admission tended to have a poorer long-term outcome according to daily functioning compared with patients without agoraphobia at admission, although both groups reported improved daily functioning at follow-up. Maintenance medication was common. No benzodiazepine abuse was reported.", 
    "4": "PD has a favourable outcome in a substantial proportion of patients. However, the illness is chronic and needs treatment. The short-term treatment given in the drug trial had no influence on the long-term outcome.", 
    "5": "Cost-containment policies frequently focus on reducing drug expenditures, although prescription drug costs are a relatively small proportion of total health care expenditures. Data show that very few drug cost-containment policies can selectively reduce unneeded care while maintaining essential care. In the early 1980s, the New Hampshire Medicaid program introduced a drug-payment limit (a \"cap\") that set the number of reimbursable medications a patient could receive per month at 3. Analyses reviewed in this article indicate that New Hampshire's drug cap, while in effect, reduced the use of prescription drugs among the elderly and the mentally ill but increased hospital and nursing home admissions, partial hospitalizations, distribution of psychoactive medications by community mental health centers, and use of emergency mental health services. Vulnerable populations are most likely to experience adverse effects from hastily-applied drug cost-containment policies, and resulting compensatory measures may create more expenses than the policy removes.", 
    "6": "Most antipsychotic drugs act equivalently and potently on the symptoms of schizophrenia, with clozapine as the notable exception. Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are strongly associated with poor prognosis; some reports suggest that these symptoms respond better to second- than to first-generation antipsychotics. Although second-generation antipsychotics exert their action through a blockade of dopamine and serotonin receptors (and some have a more complex action), each has a different set of pharmacologic characteristics, including side effects. Due to the differences among antipsychotics available today, optimizing treatment for individual patients requires choosing the most appropriate drug and, if necessary, switching to a different drug if the first proves unsatisfactory. The treating physician must carefully match the diverse needs of schizophrenic patients with the varied characteristics of the second-generation antipsychotics.", 
    "7": "An achiral monomeric surfactant (sodium 10-undecenyl sulfate, SUS) and a chiral surfactant (sodium 10-undecenoyl L-leucinate, SUL) were synthesized and polymerized individually to form poly-SUS and poly-SUL. These surfactants were then copolymerized at various molar ratios to produce a variety of copolymerized surfactants (CoPSs), possessing both achiral (sulfate) and chiral (leucinate) head groups. The CoPSs, poly-SUS, poly-SUL, and sodium dodecyl sulfate were characterized using several analytical techniques. The aggregation numbers of the polymeric surfactants and the partial specific volumes were determined by the use of fluorescence quenching and density measurements, respectively. These polymeric surfactants were investigated as novel pseudostationary phases in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) for the separation of chiral and achiral solutes. Solute hydrophobicity was found to have major influence on the MEKC retention of alkyl phenyl ketones. In contrast, hydrogen-bonding ability of benzodiazepines is the major factor that governs their retention, but hydrophobicity has an insignificant effect on MEKC retention of benzodiazepines.",

    "15": "More than a decade has passed since it was unintentionally discovered that grapefruit juice interacts with certain drugs. The coadministration of these drugs with grapefruit juice can markedly elevate drug bioavailability, and can alter pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the drug. The predominant mechanism for this interaction is the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 3A4 in the small intestine, resulting in a significant reduction of drug presystemic metabolism. An additional mechanism is, presumably, the inhibition of P-glycoprotein, a transporter that carries drug from the enterocyte back to the gut lumen, resulting in a further increase in the fraction of drug absorbed. Some calcium channel antagonists, benzodiazepines, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and cyclosporine are the most affected drugs. A single exposure to one glass of the juice can usually produce the maximal magnitude of the interaction. The data available so far, concerning this interaction and its clinical implications, are reviewed in this article. It is likely that more information regarding this interaction will accumulate in the future, and awareness of such is necessary for achieving optimal drug therapy.", 
    "16": "Increased binding of a ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding receptor is currently used in PET studies as an in vivo measurement of inflammation in diseases like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Although peripheral-type benzodiazepin receptors (PBRs) are abundant in many cell types and expressed in the CNS physiologically only at low levels, previous reports suggest that after experimental lesions in animal models and in human neurodegenerative/-inflammatory diseases upregulated PBR expression with increased binding of its ligand PK11195 is confined mainly to activated microglia in vivo/in situ. Because the functional role of the PBR is unknown, we confirm by immunohistochemistry and PCR (I) that this receptor is expressed on microglia in vitro and (II) that benzodiazepines modulate proliferation of microglial cells and the release of the inflammatory molecules nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in cell culture supernatants of primary rat microglia. Compared to lipopolysaccharide-activated controls the release of NO was markedly decreased in cultures treated with benzodiazepines (clonazepam, midazolam, diazepam) and the PBR ligand PK11195. Moreover, release of TNF-alpha and proliferation was significantly inhibited in the benzodiazepine-treated groups. These findings link the in vivo data of elevated PBR levels in neurodegenerative/-inflammatory diseases to a functional role and opens up possible therapeutic intervention targeting the PBR in microglia.", 
    "17": "Zolpidem is a new hypnotic that is supposed to have fewer side effects than traditional benzodiazepines. Some psychotic reactions, such as visual or hypnagogic hallucinations, have been reported to be associated with zolpidem use.", 
    "18": "A young female experienced three episodes of hallucination associated with the use of zolpidem. The visual or hypnagogic hallucination happened after she had stopped zolpidem and then restarted it 2 days later.", 
    "19": "We postulate that hypnagogic or visual hallucinations associated with zolpidem use may be related to rapid withdrawal and restarting of zolpidem. The possible mechanism may be associated with the changes in the GABAA receptor. Avoiding \"as needed\" use of zolpidem and using the lowest effective dose may prevent these adverse effects.", 
    "20": "Flunitrazepam (FNTZ), like other benzodiazepines, has a high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor within the gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) complex. These affinities correlate with the pharmacological and therapeutic potencies of the drug. FNTZ is a drug commonly abused by young adults. In humans, FNTZ is oxidized to the major metabolites N-demethylflunitrazepam (DM FNTZ) and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam (3-OH FNTZ) and reduced to 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7A FNTZ). Human CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are the principal P-450 cytochromes involved in DM FNTZ and 3-OH FNTZ formation. However, it is not clear which enzyme is responsible for the reduction of FNTZ to 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7A FNTZ). In this study, the involvement of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in the conversion of FNTZ to 7A FNTZ was investigated in two human hepatoma cell lines, human lymphoblast microsomes specifically expressing human NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and purified recombinant human HADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Significantly more FNTZ was converted to 7A FNTZ in Hep G2 than in Hep 3B cells, and this difference was associated with the catalytic activity and protein levels of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in these cells. In Hep G2 cells, conversion of FNTZ to 7A FNTZ was effectively inhibited by alpha-lipoic acid, an NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase inhibitor. In addition, formation of 7A FNTZ by the microsomal fraction of Hep G2 cells was specifically inhibited by antibody against NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Under hypoxia (N2 85%; CO2 5%; H2 10%), human lymphoblast microsomes specifically expressing human NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and purified recombinant human NADPH-P-450 reductase catabolized FNTZ to 7A FNTZ in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase is involved in the reductive metabolism of FNTZ to 7A FNTZ under hypoxic conditions.", 
    "21": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the [3H]PK11195 binding parameters in a model of acute inflammation, the N-formylmethionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulated neutrophil cell membranes, and to analyze if alterations of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) characteristics occurred in neutrophil cell membranes of patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriasic arthritis (PA).", 
    "22": "Neutrophils were obtained from 15 patients with OA, 15 patients with RA, and 15 patients with PA. fMLP stimulation was performed to aliquots of neutrophils from six healthy individuals. Evaluation of kinetic parameters of PBR was performed using [3H]PK11195, as specific radioligand compared with 15 healthy volunteers.", 
    "23": "The results showed a significant decrease of Kd and Bmax in fMLP-stimulated neutrophil membranes. Moreover, an increase of PBR binding sites and affinity value was observed in neutrophils membranes from PA patients.", 
    "24": "Our data suggested a fMLP modulation on [3H]PK11195 binding in human neutrophils. Moreover, our results showed an up-regulation of PBR in neutrophils of PA patients.", 
    "25": "Common practice in intubation without muscle relaxant is to inject the opioid drug prior to the hypnotic drug. Because remifentanil reaches adequate cerebral concentration more rapidly than does propofol, we tested the hypothesis that injection of remifentanil after propofol might lead to better intubating conditions.", 
    "26": "Thirty ASA I-II patients scheduled for elective surgery and with no anticipated difficult intubation were enrolled in the study. Five minutes after midazolam 30 microg kg(-1), patients were randomized into two groups: group PR received propofol 2.5 mg kg(-1) followed by remifentanil 1 microg kg(-1), and group RP received remifentanil 1 microg kg(-1) followed by propofol 2.5 mg kg(-1). Intubating conditions were compared using a well-validated score, and continuous arterial pressure was recorded non-invasively.", 
    "27": "Compared with group RP, intubating conditions were significantly better in group PR. The mean arterial pressure decrease was more pronounced in group RP.", 
    "28": "We therefore conclude that in premedicated healthy patients with no anticipated risk of difficult intubation, intubating and haemodynamic conditions are better when remifentanil is injected after propofol.",

    "34": "Sedation pattern was different among diagnosis-groups. No therapy was registered in 18.8% of overall days in polytrauma vs 67.6% of cardiac patients. Opioids supply ranged from 10.1% of overall days of acute on COPD patients vs 51.4% of polytrauma patients. Propofol was the more prescribed drug, followed by opioids and benzodiazepines. Propofol was at the top in cerebrovascular disease, ALI/ARDS and COPD; opioids in abdominal surgery and trauma, benzodiazepines in cardiac failure. The average number of prescribed drugs per day was 1.5 ranging from 1.2 on COPD to 1.7 in head trauma.", 
    "35": "Diagnosis influences the pattern of sedation-analgesia during high-level-of-care period. Sedation prevalence is reasonably prescribed in trauma groups while it remains low in ALI/ARDS, post-operative, cerebrovascular, COPD and hearth failure. Particularly opioid use remains limited in post-operative patients. This surveys shows a poorly standardised sedation approach to the different phases of the therapy: induction, short and long-term sedation phase.", 
    "36": "Actigraphy is a quantitative method for the measurement of motor activity. In the present study, actigraphy was used to examine psychomotor correlates of brain activity. Thirty-four psychiatric patients (17 males and 17 females) with different diagnoses participated in this investigation. Directly after EEG recording, motor activity was measured with a wrist actimeter for 15 min in patients in the sitting position. The EEG was quantified by spectrum analysis, and the power spectra as well as other EEG-derived variables were correlated with actigraphic parameters. Occipital and temporoparietal beta1 power was statistically significantly higher in patients with higher activity scores and lower in those with a high density of sleep (SB) or wake bouts (WB). A high density of SB or WB was also positively correlated with higher mean alpha power. Immobile phases measured by actigraphy were positively associated with occipital alpha and with frontal/frontopolar delta activity, preferentially on the side of the left hemisphere. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that short-term actigraphy may be apt to reflect central nervous system arousal.", 
    "37": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an internal protein of the mammalian mitochondrial membrane, is involved in several metabolic functions such as steroidogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and regulation of cell proliferation. Here we report the presence of PBRs in parenchymal and meristematic tissues of potato (Solanum tuberosum). PBRs are heterogeneously distributed in potato and are highly expressed in meristematic cells. In particular the receptor protein is mainly localised in the meristematic nuclear subcellular preparation. This 30-36 kDa protein, which corresponds to PBR, is increased, indeed, in meristematic compared to the parenchymal tissue. This suggests an involvement of this receptor in the regulation of cell plant growth. In addition, the demonstration that PBRs are also present in vegetables supports the hypothesis of a highly conserved receptor system during phylogenesis.", 
    "38": "In recent years, psychopharmacotherapy in the elderly has been advanced by the introduction of newly developed drugs with high effectiveness and good tolerability. However, up to now these advances have not yet led to a broad change in the psychopharmacological treatment of elderly patients. Elderly patients with psychiatric disorders are frequently treated with older drugs, which have a high risk of side effects and drug interactions. The consequences are severe complications, such as falls or delirious episodes. In this article, general aspects of psychopharmacotherapy in the elderly will be briefly summarized. Special aspects of the treatment with antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, phase prophylactics and antidementives will be discussed in detail and recommendations for treatment will be given.", 
    "39": "The primary objective of this study was to evaluate insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects treated with olanzapine or risperidone. Subjects were randomly assigned to single-blind therapy with olanzapine (10 mg/d), risperidone (4 mg/d), or placebo for approximately 3 wk. Insulin sensitivity was assessed pre- and posttreatment using a 2-step, hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. Glucose and insulin responses were also assessed by a mixed meal tolerance test. Of the 64 subjects randomized, 22, 14, and 19 in the olanzapine, risperidone, and placebo groups, respectively, completed the study procedures. There were no significant within-group changes in the glucose disposal rate or the insulin sensitivity index for the active therapy groups. Further, the results of the mixed meal tolerance test did not demonstrate clinically significant changes in integrated glucose metabolism during treatment with these medications. In summary, this study did not demonstrate significant changes in insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects after 3 wk of treatment with olanzapine or risperidone.", 
    "40": "A major problem in preclinical drug development where blood sampling from small animals is a routine practice is the time and labor involved in the serial sampling of small blood volumes from small animals such as rats for the duration of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies. The traditional method of manually drawing blood from the animal requires the animal to be anesthetized or restrained with some device, both of which cause stress to the animal.", 
    "41": "An automated blood sampler (ABS) was developed to simultaneously collect blood and brain microdialysate samples at preprogrammed time points from awake and freely moving animals. The samples are delivered to fraction collectors and stored at 4 degrees C until use. The lost blood volume during collection is replaced with sterile saline to prevent fluid loss from the animal. In addition, the system is capable of collecting urine and feces for metabolism studies and monitoring the animal activity for behavioral studies. In the present study, blood samples were collected for 24 h after dosing rats orally with a 5 mg/kg dose of olanzapine (OLAN). Brain dialysates were collected for the same duration from a microdialysis probe implanted in the striatum.", 
    "42": "The pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained after an oral dose, are in good agreement with reported values in literature. The pharmacodynamic information obtained from brain dialysates data show that OLAN elevates the concentration of dopamine (DA) in the brain and remains in the brain even after it is cleared from the plasma.", 
    "43": "The ABS described here is a very useful tool in drug development to accelerate the pace of preclinical in vivo studies and to simultaneously provide pharmacodynamic and physiological information.", 
    "44": "Previous research has shown that lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) inhibit fear-related behavior in rats (Brain Res. 969 (2003) 183-194). However, at present little is known about the role of specific neurotransmitter receptor systems within the MPFC in the mediation of fear and anxiety. For example, extensive research has demonstrated the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in decreasing fear-related behavior. However, no research has yet been published regarding the effects of micro-infusions of benzodiazepines, or any other GABA-A receptor agonist, into the MPFC. In addition, previous work has suggested that there may be functional differences between the dorsal and ventral subregions of the MPFC in regard to fear and anxiety. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of dorsal and ventral MPFC infusions of the benzodiazepine midazolam in two well-validated animal models of anxiety, the elevated plus maze and the shock probe burying test. The results showed that bilateral (5 microg/side) infusions of midazolam into the MPFC produced anxiolytic effects in both behavioural tests, without affecting general activity or pain sensitivity. Furthermore, these anxiolytic effects were found in both the dorsal and ventral regions of the MPFC. The present findings indicate that the benzodiazepine receptors of the MPFC are capable of modulating fear-related behaviors.", 
    "45": "In the paper there have presented results of the analysis of small blood samples taken routinely from 3 cases after car accidents and 1 rapist. Fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA, Abott) was used for screening examinations of narcotics from the group of both opium and cocaine alkaloids, barbituric acid and benzodiazepine and also drugs from the group of tricyclic antidepressants. Confirmation of the obtained results and full identification of the substances analysed were carried out by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In the causes of car accidents components of \"compote\" were found (poppy straw extract) morphine and codeine (1 case), cocaine (1 case) and also tramadol and diazepam (1 case) were also found. In the rapist methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was determined.", 
    "46": "In this paper results of the research on the usefulness of toxicological analysis relating to narcotics in intraocular fluid have been presented. The examined material comprised intraocular fluids and blood samples collected from 332 deceased suspected of being intoxicated or poisoned with psychoactive agents. The cases in which death resulted from injuries and those where an individual took drugs before his or her death were also considered. Drug analysis was carried out by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). In both biological fluids the degree of hydratation was determined. Ethyl alcohol, opiates, barbiturates and benzodiazepines were found in all the examined cases. In few cases ethanol substitutes such as isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol and methyl alcohol were indicated. Results of the quantitative examinations were divided into sets according to the kind of xenobiotic and then on the basics of concentration of the substance found in the blood and vitreous body 2 different groups were separated in each set. Statistic analysis of the correlations among xenobiotic concentrations in both organic fluids was also performed. The obtained findings allow to assume that intraocular fluid can be used for toxicological diagnosis of poisonings with psycho-active agents. The analytical results for intraocular fluid not only confirms the result for blood but also makes it credible. In single cases it can be a sufficient basis to determine and recognize psychoactive agents in the deceased.", 
    "47": "147 cases of fatal poisonings in people due to narcotic abuse examined in the Forensic Medicine Department Silesian School of Medicine, Katowice in the years 1996-2002 have been presented in the paper. In the group examined there were 126 males and 21 females at the age of 16-44. Opium narcotics were found in 139 out of 147 cases and amphetamine derivatives in 18. Opiates were indicated in 58 individuals and amphetamine only in 8. In 35 poisoned people opiates with barbituric acid derivatives were found. In 3 cases death resulted after taking opiates and amphetamine derivatives. 1 individual died after taking opiates and substances of the phenothiazine group. In the organic fluids of 18 people opiates and medicines being derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepine and barbituric acid were found. Amphetamine and derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepine were found in 6 individuals and opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and amphetamine in 1 individual. Concentrations of all the substances indicated ranged widely and were as follows: < 0.10-17.40 > microgram/ml for opiates; < 0.24-30.00 > microgram/ml for amphetamine; < 0.12-1.90 > microgram/ml for 1.4-benzodiazepine derivatives and < 0.18-15.24 > microgram/ml for barbituric acid derivatives.

    "49": "The most frequently used drugs for premedication are benzodiazepines and alpha (2)-adrenoceptor agonists. In this study we examined midazolam and clonidine for premedication in combination with target controlled infusion anaesthesia (TCI) in patients undergoing orthopaedic shoulder surgery and analysed the effects on the peri- and postoperative course.", 
    "50": "Forty-five Patients (ASA I-III) were included in this prospective randomized, double blind study. Sixty minutes prior to anaesthetic induction the patients received clonidine in a dosage of 2 microg x kg(-1) (group ND) or 5 microg x kg(-1) (group HD) or 0.1 mg x kg(-1) midazolam (group midazolam) per orally. Anaesthesia was performed as TCI with propofol (plasma concentration 2.0-4.0 microg x ml(-1)) und remifentanil (plasma concentration 0.2-0.4 microg x ml(-1) x min(-1)). 15 minutes before the operation was finished, all patients received a bolus dose of 0.1 mg x kg(-1) piritramid i.v., followed by administration of piritramid via a PCA pump (patient controlled analgesia) for a duration of 24 hours. During the time of the operation the influence of premedication on the anaesthetic course was determined by vital parameters and ranking scales. For statistic evaluation we used the Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA with Tukey as post hoc test and the test named after Fisher (p < 0.05).", 
    "51": "The effects of premedication on haemodynamic parameters and ranking scales for sedation as well as anaesthetic requirements were comparable in all three groups. In the postoperative period the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (ND: n = 8, HD: n = 2, midazolam: n = 6) and the use of pritramid were lower in the clonidine HD group (HD: 38.7 +/- 30.7 mg, ND: 51.7 +/- 25.1 mg, midazolam: 45.1 +/- 30.4 mg) than in the other groups.", 
    "52": "Premedication with the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine is as good as with benzodiazepines in combination with TCI. Because of the lower incidence of PONV and the need of piritramid in the postoperative period patients premedicated with 5 microg x kg(-1) clonidine may benefit from this premedication.", 
    "53": "Alcohol is a socially tolerated drug. Its consumption is associated with several physiological and pharmacological negative side-effects during anaesthesia and intensive care. The impact of chronic and acute alcoholism on perioperative morbidity and mortality and especially on anaesthetic risk are important, due to pharmacological interactions, pathophysiological changes and direct pharmacological interactivities between alcohol and narcotics. In contrast to opioid withdrawal symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are a serious and potentially life-threatening complication and should be avoided or the risk for occurrence must at least be reduced. Patients with a high risk of developing perioperative symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can be detected by laboratory tests and questionnaires. A prophylaxis of withdrawal should be started preoperatively solely with benzodiazepines or in combination with clonidine. Haloperidol is the drug of choice for emerging symptoms of alcohol withdrawal with productive psychosis. To estimate the pharmacological changes during anaesthesia, it is necessary to differentiate whether the patient is an occasional drinker with acute intoxication, a chronic abuser without limitations of hepatic function or a chronic user with insufficiency of the liver. The most important implication for anaesthesia are the choice of a rapid sequence induction to reduce the risk of aspiration and the maintenance of haemodynamic stability and liver perfusion. For the acute alcoholic providing prolonged postoperative surveillance is necessary, for the chronic alcoholic intensive care seems to be mandatory. For regional anaesthesia the indications and limitations are the same as for other patients (cooperativeness, coagulation, consent, etc.).", 
    "54": "Previously, we reported that the GABA(A)receptor containing alpha(5)subunit played a significant role in the reinforcing actions of EtOH in rats selectively bred to consume alcohol. However, the role of the alpha(5) receptor in regulating the neurobehavioral effects of EtOH in outbred rats is not known.", 
    "55": "In the present study, RY024, a novel benzodiazepine (BDZ) inverse agonist with high affinity (K(d) approximately 0.40 nM) and selectivity (approximately 67.3-fold) for the alpha(5)receptor, was investigated for its capacity to antagonize EtOH's reinforcing, motor impairing, and sedative effects in Long-Evans rats.",

RY024 (3.0-15 mg/kg; IP) also reversed the motor impairing effects of a moderate (0.75 g/kg), and intoxicating EtOH dose (1.25 g/kg) in the absence of intrinsic effects. Finally, RY024 (7.5 mg/kg) attenuated the sedation produced by the 1.25 g/kg EtOH dose; however, it failed to attenuate the sedation induced by the 0.75 g/kg EtOH dose. Given alone, RY024 exhibited intrinsic effects in the open field.",

    "59": "Several lines of evidence indicate that inhibition of the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor 5 produces anxiolytic-like effects in rodents. Peptide neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) produces an anxiolytic effect in rats after intraventricular or intra-amygdalar administration. Many classes of anxiolytic drugs exert their effect through the GABA-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor complex. Therefore, in the present study we have investigated whether the anxiolytic action of MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridyne), an mGlu5 receptor antagonist, is mediated by a mechanism involving either the GABA-BZD receptor complex or NPY receptor. In the behavioral studies, the anxiolytic activity of MPEP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was examined using plus-maze test. The BZD antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was given to one group of rats and Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO 3304 (((R)-N-[[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl) phenyl] methyl]-N2-(diphenylacetyl)-argininamide trifluoroacetate)3304) (200 pmol/site, intra-amygdala) to the other. It was found that anxiolytic effects of MPEP were not changed by flumazenil, but were abolished by BIBO 3304. Immunohistochemical studies showed a high density of mGlu5 receptor immunoreactivity (IR) in the amygdala. The effect of MPEP on NPY expression in the amygdala was studied using immunohistochemistry (IH) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Both methods showed a diminution of NPY IR expression, to about 43% (IH) or 81% (RIA) of the control level after multiple administrations, but we observed an increase up to 148% of the control after single MPEP administration. These effects may suggest a release of NPY from nerve terminals after MPEP administration. Our results indicate that the anxiolytic action of MPEP is conveyed through NPY neurons with the involvement of Y1 receptors in the amygdala and that BZD receptors do not significantly contribute to these effects.", 
    "60": "The present study tested the hypothesis that GABA(A) and opioid receptors within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) regulate ethanol (EtOH), but not sucrose-maintained responding. To accomplish this, betaCCt, a mixed benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonist-antagonist with binding selectivity at the alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor, and the nonselective opioid antagonist, naltrexone, were bilaterally infused directly into the CeA of alcohol-preferring rats. The results demonstrated that in HAD-1 and P rat lines, betaCCt (5-60 microg) reduced EtOH-maintained responding by 56-89% of control levels. On day 2, betaCCt (10-40 microg) continued to suppress EtOH maintained responding in HAD-1 rats by as much as 60-85% of control levels. Similarly, naltrexone (0.5-30 microg) reduced EtOH-maintained responding by 56-75% of control levels in P rats. betaCCt and naltrexone exhibited neuroanatomical and reinforcer specificity within the CeA. Specifically, no effects on EtOH-maintained responding were observed following infusion into the caudate putamen (CPu), a locus several millimeters dorsal to the CeA. Additionally, responding maintained by sucrose, when presented concurrently with ethanol (EtOH) or presented alone, was not altered by betaCCt. Naltrexone reduced sucrose-maintained responding only under the 5 microg dose condition when sucrose was presented alone, however, it did not alter sucrose responding when given concurrently with EtOH. These results support the hypothesis that GABA(A) and opioid receptors within the CeA can selectively regulate EtOH-maintained responding. The CeA may represent a novel target site in the development of prototypical GABA(A) and opioidergic receptor ligands, which selectively reduce alcohol abuse in humans.", 
    "61": "Opiate users (n = 135) from southern England, Glasgow and Edinburgh were interviewed about opiate overdose (lifetime). Fifty-six percent had overdosed. The majority (66%) reported mixing opiates with at least one other drug (mainly alcohol and/or benzodiazepines) at their last overdose. Patients identified misjudgements of purity, mixing drugs and misjudgements of tolerance as causes of overdose. The sample was divided into groups: (1) 'no prescription', (2) prescribed 'diazepam only', (3) prescribed 'methadone only' and (4) prescribed 'methadone + diazepam'. The 'methadone + diazepam' group reported more lifetime and deliberate overdoses, the 'methadone only' group were more likely to have used several drugs at the time of their last overdose and the 'no prescription' group to have used only heroin. Drug users' overdose risk may vary as a result of their prescribed and non-prescribed drug use. Interventions should be developed and tailored according to clients' needs and current use patterns.", 
    "62": "Organophosphate (OP) insecticide toxicity is the leading cause of major morbidity and death in the insecticides class. The clinical syndrome of OP toxicity varies widely, ranging from the classic cholinergic syndrome to flaccid paralysis and intractable seizures. The mainstays of therapy for OP-poisoned patients are atropine, pralidoxime, and benzodiazepines. Tachycardia is not a contraindication to treatment with atropine in OP toxicity. Atropine should be administered to alleviate respiratory distress, symptomatic bradycardia, and as an adjunct to benzodiazepines to alleviate seizure activity. Atropine should not be administered systemically to alleviate miosis. In acute OP toxicity, a continuous pralidoxime infusion should be considered. Intermediate syndrome and OP-induced delayed neuropathy may occur in select patients with OP poisoning.", 
    "63": "Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is the most commonly used herbal preparation in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The objective of this study was to determine whether a characterized saw palmetto product affects the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or 3A4 in healthy volunteers (6 men and 6 women). The probe substrates dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 activity) and alprazolam (CYP3A4 activity) were administered orally at baseline and again after exposure to saw palmetto (320-mg capsule once daily) for 14 days. Dextromethorphan metabolic ratios and alprazolam pharmacokinetics were determined at baseline and after saw palmetto treatment. The mean ratio of dextromethorphan to its metabolite was 0.038 +/- 0.044 at baseline and 0.048 +/- 0.080 after 14 days of saw palmetto administration (P =.704, not significant [NS]), indicating a lack of effect on CYP2D6 activity. The area under the plasma alprazolam concentration versus time curve was 476 +/- 178 h. ng. mL(-1) at baseline and 479 +/- 125 h. ng. mL(-1) after saw palmetto treatment (P =.923, NS), indicating a lack of effect on CYP3A4 activity. The elimination half-life of alprazolam was 11.4 +/- 3.1 hours at baseline and 11.6 +/- 2.7 hours after saw palmetto treatment (P =.770, NS), also indicating a lack of effect on CYP3A4 activity. Our results indicate that extracts of saw palmetto at generally recommended doses are unlikely to alter the disposition of coadministered medications primarily dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways for elimination. These conclusions must be weighed in the context of the study's limited assessments and regarded as only the initial investigation into the drug interaction potential of saw palmetto.",

    "72": "Following stroke, approximately 90% of patients experience persistent neurological motor deficits that lead to disability and handicap. Both pharmacological and physical treatment strategies for motor rehabilitation may be considered. In terms of pharmacological treatment, drugs that may potentially promote motor recovery when added to a regimen of physical therapy include the stimulants amphetamine and methylphenidate, as well as levodopa and fluoxetine. Botulinum toxin A has proven effective and well tolerated in several placebo-controlled trials for the treatment of focal upper and lower limb spasticity, although it has not been shown to improve motor function. The focal injection of botulinum toxin A inhibits the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, resulting in a reversible paresis of the muscles relevant for the spastic deformity. Other drugs, such as benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and antipsychotics, may have detrimental effects on motor function and should be avoided, if possible. With respect to physical strategies, modern concepts of motor learning favour a task-specific repetitive approach that induces skill-acquisition relevant to the patient's daily life. Constrained-induced movement therapy based on the concept of learned non-use, electromyography-triggered electrical stimulation of the wrist muscles, robot-assisted motor rehabilitation to increase therapy intensity and bilateral practice to facilitate the movement of the paretic extremity are examples in upper limb rehabilitation. Lower limb rehabilitation has been enriched by treadmill training with partial bodyweight support, enabling the practice of up to 1000 steps per session; automated gait rehabilitation to relieve the strenuous effort required of the therapist; and rhythmic auditory stimulation, applying individually adjusted music to improve walking speed and symmetry.",

    "77": "There is growing interest in insomnia both from the perspective of recent advances in clinical management as well as research aimed at elucidating its pathophysiology. This theoretical overview of insomnia describes the negative impact, etiological considerations, and pharmacological and behavioral treatments for the disorder, with an emphasis on areas receiving increased research attention. Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep disorder, affects 10-15% of the general population. In population-based studies severe insomnia has been shown to last for a median of 4 years. In addition, insomnia has a significant negative impact on an individual's work, physical, and social performance as well as overall quality of life. Furthermore, the economic cost of insomnia related to lost productivity, work-related accidents, absenteeism, and health-care costs are enormous. There is increasing evidence linking the precipitation of insomnia to stress, and converging evidence from cognitive, endocrine, neurological, and behavioral domains provide clear evidence for hyper-arousal in insomnia. However, there remains no consensus regarding the specific etiological mechanisms of this disorder. Although the pathophysiology of primary insomnia remains an enigma, numerous treatments both pharmacological and behavioral have been developed and found to be efficacious in controlled studies. Despite the wide availability of pharmacological treatments and increased knowledge of behavioral interventions, the vast majority of individuals with insomnia do not appear to be receiving adequate treatment. The inadequate treatment of insomnia leads to several important and under-recognized consequences including subsequent development of psychiatric disease and increased substance use.", 
    "78": "The combination of ketamine and topical placebo cream was compared with the combination of midazolam and topical lidocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) in 13 children with leukaemia undergoing bone marrow punctures. This double-blind, randomized, crossover study showed that the children prefer midazolam and EMLA as sedation for invasive procedures and that some parents and the nursing staff have doubts because of the anxiety during the procedure and the physical restraint that often is necessary during midazolam and EMLA. Both methods cause several, more or less unpleasant, side effects.", 
    "79": "Rats selectively bred for amygdala excitability, realized by fast or slow kindling epileptogenesis, were previously reported to exhibit differential levels of anxiety. Although the Slow kindling rats generally appeared more anxious in several behavioral tests, under certain test conditions the Fast kindling rats displayed greater anxiety or stressor reactivity. The present investigation confirmed that in a test of anxiety comprising suppression of consumption of a palatable snack in an unfamiliar environment, the Slow kindling rats exhibited greater anxiety and that this effect was attenuated by diazepam. Likewise, the acoustic startle response was greater in the Slow kindling rats. However, the fear-potentiated startle response was more pronounced in Fast kindling rats, particularly among females, irrespective of whether the test parameters elicited moderate or high startle amplitudes. The elevated startle in the Slow rats, and the fear potentiated startle in the Fast rats, were attenuated by diazepam. These data indicate the need to differentiate subtypes of anxiety in animal models, and raise the issue that anxiety elicited by specific environmental triggers may interact with genetically determined trait characteristics.", 
    "80": "All benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine site agonists impair motor performance dose-dependently and potentiate the effects of ethanol. In order to evaluate the risk of benzodiazepine and ethanol interaction with the direct acting GABA(A) receptor agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (5,4-c) pyridin-3-ol (gaboxadol), we studied impairment of motor coordination for combinations of gaboxadol, ethanol and a series of benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, zolpidem and indiplon) in a rat rotarod model. All compounds produced a dose-dependent motor impairment and, in agreement with earlier data, a supra-additive effect of the benzodiazepine ligands and ethanol 1 g/kg was seen. In contrast, no significant potentiation of the effects of gaboxadol by ethanol was detected, and furthermore, no synergistic interaction between gaboxadol and any of the benzodiazepines was seen. A 30-day tolerance study was conducted with daily injections of gaboxadol (7.9 mg/kg) and zolpidem (1.25 mg/kg), respectively. A time-dependent tolerance developed to the motor impairment produced by both compounds. On day 31, cross-tolerance studies between zolpidem/gaboxadol and gaboxadol/zolpidem were conducted. No cross-tolerance was observed, indicating that the motor coordination effects observed with gaboxadol and zolpidem may arise from interaction with different receptor populations.", 
    "81": "The aim of this study was to better understand the mechanisms that underlie adaptive changes in GABA(A) receptors following their prolonged exposure to drugs. Exposure (48 and/or 96 h) of human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells stably expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2s GABA(A) receptors for gamma-aminobutyric (GABA, 1 mM) and muscimol (100 microM), but not for diazepam (1 microM), enhanced the maximum number (B(max)) of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites without affecting their affinity (K(d)). The GABA-induced enhancement in B(max) was reduced by the GABA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (100 microM), and by cycloheximide (10 microl/ml), a protein synthesis inhibitor. GABA (100 microM) enhanced the affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to vehicle- and GABA-pretreated, but not to diazepam-pretreated, HEK 293 cells. The results suggest that chronic GABA treatment up-regulates stably expressed GABA(A) receptors, presumably by stimulating their synthesis. Unlike chronic diazepam, which produced functional uncoupling of GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites, chronic GABA failed to produce this effect.", 
    "82": "Freezing behavior is a common response to distal threatening stimuli. It has been reported that experimenter-presented 20-kHz tones produce freezing in Wistar rats. The present studies were designed to determine the acoustic specificity for induction of the emission of ultrasound vocalizations (USV) and freezing of rats to either ultrasound tones or to a standard stressor, foot-shocks. We also examined whether GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms, known for modulating anxiety-related processes, are involved in the regulation of defensive responses to these two aversive unconditioned stimuli. It was found that emission of USV was only observed with foot-shocks. Moreover, rats exhibited freezing when they were exposed to foot-shocks and 20-25-kHz ultrasound signals. Likewise, removal of the GABAergic inhibitory control on the neural substrates of aversion in the inferior colliculus by local microinjections of semicarbazide, a blocker of the glutamic acid decarboxylase, caused freezing behavior without emission of USV. All these responses were significantly reduced by midazolam and muscimol. It is suggested that the neural substrates of aversion in the inferior colliculus are under inhibitory control of GABAergic mechanisms and are different from those triggered by foot-shocks.",

    "98": "The drug-violence relationship exists for several reasons, some direct (drugs pharmacologically inducing violence) and some indirect (violence occurring in order to attain drugs). Moreover, the nature of that relationship is often complex, with intoxication, neurotoxic, and withdrawal effects often being confused and/or confounded. This paper reviews the existing literature regarding the extent to which various drugs of abuse may be directly associated with heightened interpersonal violence. Alcohol is clearly the drug with the most evidence to support a direct intoxication-violence relationship. The literatures concerning benzodiazepines, opiates, psychostimulants, and phencyclidine (PCP) are idiosyncratic but suggest that personality factors may be as (or more) important than pharmacological ones. Cannabis reduces likelihood of violence during intoxication, but mounting evidence associates withdrawal with aggressivity. The literature on the relationship between steroids and aggression is largely confounded, and between 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and aggression insufficient to draw any reasonable conclusions. Conclusions and policy implications are briefly discussed.", 
    "99": "Insomnia is a frequent health problem in prison, but little is known about its severity and duration. The objective was to find out whether subjective sleep quality improves during time and which factors influence improvement. Fifty-two randomly chosen prisoners complaining of insomnia at the Geneva remand prison were interviewed (T1) and followed up ten days (T2) and two months (T3) later. They received hypnotics habitually prescribed by prison physicians (benzodiazepines, chloralhydrate, zolpidem). After ten days 40 patients were still in prison and agreed to participate and after two months 16 prisoners could be re-evaluated. Total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores at T1 were 12.3 +/- 4.7. At T2 and T3, PSQI scores improved significantly, whereas General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) scores and conditions of imprisonment were similar. Only 12.5% of patients at T2, and 6.25% at T3, were 'good sleepers' (PSQI scores =/< 5). Cocaine users and prisoners with a healthy lifestyle reported the greatest improvement of PSQI scores. Our study shows that significant improvement of PSQI scores takes place in the first one to two weeks. However, in spite of regular drug treatment during the following weeks, PSQI scores persisted at a clinically significant level two months later. Drug treatment in prison only partially improves insomnia.", 
    "100": "The evolution of cellular damage over time and the selective vulnerability of different neuronal subtypes was characterized in the striatum following 30-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion in the mouse. Using autoradiography we found an increase in the density of [3H]PK11195 binding sites--likely reflecting microglial activation--in the lesion border at 3 days and in the whole striatum from 10 days to 6 weeks. This was accompanied by a distinct loss of [3H]flumazenil and [3H]CGP39653 binding sites from 10 days up to 6 weeks reflecting neuronal loss. Brain ischemia resulted in a substantial loss of medium spiny projection neurons as seen at three days by Nissl staining, TUNEL and immunocytochemistry using antibodies against microtubule-associated protein (MAP2), NeuN, mu-opioid receptors, substance P, L-enkephalin, neurokinin B, choline acetyltransferase, parvalbumin, calretinin and somatostatin. Both patch and matrix compartments were involved in ischemic damage. In contrast, the numbers of cholinergic, GABAergic, and somatostatin-containing interneurons in the ischemic striatum were not different from those in the contralateral hemisphere at 3 and 14 days. A low density of glutamate receptors, the ability to sequester calcium by calcium-binding proteins and other hitherto unidentified factors may explain this relative resistance of interneurons to acute ischemia.", 
    "101": "Benzodiazepines, although not listed in the American Heart Association's guidelines for the treatment of chest pain, are often used to provide symptomatic relief to patients who experience chest pain. To investigate the utility of benzodiazepines in the treatment of chest pain, the pharmacologic actions and cardiovascular effects of benzodiazepines were reviewed. In addition, a literature search regarding the use of benzodiazepines to treat patients with chest pain was conducted. The results indicated that benzodiazepines reduce anxiety, pain, and cardiovascular activation. Benzodiazepines amplify gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) throughout the central nervous system, and act more peripherally to reduce catecholamines. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that benzodiazepines may cause coronary vasodilatation, prevent dysrhythmias, and block platelet aggregation, though further study is needed. Both non-cardiac chest pain (associated with musculoskeletal, esophageal, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions) and cardiac chest pain (associated with acute and chronic myocardial ischemia) seem to be effectively treated with benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are safe and well tolerated when administered alone or in combination with other medications. Moreover, the risk of dependence is minimal when benzodiazepines are prescribed on a short-term basis. Further study of benzodiazepines in the treatment of acute chest pain is needed to confirm these favorable actions and better define their use in the acute medical setting.", 
    "102": "Benzodiazepines are among the most widely prescribed therapeutic agents, having anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative/hypnotic, and amnestic properties (Mehta and Ticku, Brain Res. Rev. 29 (1999) 196). Recent research indicates that these disparate actions are dissociable (Nature 401 (1999) 796; Science 290 (2000) 131; Kralic et al., Neuropharmacology 43 (2002) 685). Behavioral studies indicate that the amygdala plays a critical role in the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines (Nagy et al., Neuropharmacology 18 (1979) 573; The amygdala: anxiety and benzodiazepines. The Amygdala: a Functional Analysis. p. 195). However, the neuronal substrates of this anxiolytic effect remain unclear. Our study characterizes the physiological response to acute application of the benzodiazepine diazepam and the non-benzodiazepine sedative zolpidem using whole cell patch recording in two discrete amygdala subnuclei. We found that acute application of diazepam enhances GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) with equal potency in the basolateral (BL) and central (Ce) amygdala subnuclei. However, zolpidem enhanced IPSCs with similar potency only in the BL, and was effective in the Ce only at high concentrations. This finding is in agreement with histochemical data regarding the localization of GABA(A) receptor isoforms in the amygdala (J. Comp. Neurol. 359 (1995) 154; Brain Res. 964 (2003) 91) and suggests that anxiolytic effects of allosteric modulators of the GABA(A) receptor may be further dissociated from their hypnotic/sedative effects.",

Six healthy Japanese male subjects were randomly divided into three groups and each subject was treated with quazepam under the following three conditions by the crossover method. For the fasting state, subjects were administered 15 mg quazepam 11 hours after a meal. For the postprandial state, subjects were administered 15 mg or 30 mg quazepam 2 hours after a meal. Mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of quazepam was significantly higher [1.6-2.8 fold] with administration 2 hours after a meal than 11 hours after a meal. However, in regard to 15 mg of quazepam administration, the area under the curve (AUC) did not differ between administration 2 hours after a meal and 11 hours after a meal. In addition, differences were observed neither in other pharmacokinetic parameters or blood metabolite concentration under all of the study conditions, nor in clinical evaluation of subjective symptoms, complete blood count, or biochemical analyses between administrations 2 and 11 hrs after a meal. The present study showed that administration 2 hours after a meal did not affect subjective symptoms or physical functions so much; therefore it suggested favorable tolerance of this drug. However, it was also suggested that, in actual clinical use, it is important to evaluate the physical function including measurements of vital signs and hematological test results, carefully considering the effects of foods and daily life-style.",

Various types of agents belonged to classes of household products (47.0%), drugs (21.8%), industrial chemicals (7.9%), agricultural pesticides (9.1%), bites and stings (3.2%), plants (1.5%), miscellaneous products (5.3%) and unknown products (4.0%). The incidence of poisoning was highest due to household products comprising mainly pyrethroids, parad/thermometer mercury, rodenticides, phenyl, detergents and corrosives, etc. Poisoning due to drugs mainly included anticonvulsants, thyroid hormones, benzodiazepines, analgesics and oral contraceptives. Among the agricultural pesticides aluminium phosphide was the most commonly consumed, followed by organochlorines and organophosphates, etc. Paint thinners were common among industrial chemicals. Bites and stings were mainly snake bites and scorpion stings. Poisoning due to plants was low and Datura was commonly ingested. Although these data may not give an exact picture of the incidence rate in our country, due to underreporting of calls to the Centre and because the actual incidence might be higher or even variable, but they do give the trend in India, indicating that a strong emphasis should be placed on a prevention campaign which can at least reduce the occurrence of accidental pediatric poisoning.",

Prior administration of diazepam and muscimol that promote the function of GABA(A) receptors reversed the anxiogenic response and decreased food intake elicited by alpha-MSH. In contrast, bicuculline, the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, not only enhanced the effects of alpha-MSH but also prevented the influence of GABAergic drugs on alpha-MSH-induced anorexia and anxiety.

The enzyme kinetics for the formation of N-demethylzolmitriptan from zolmitriptan in rat liver microsomes pretreated with BNF were 96+/-22 microM (K(m)), 11+/-3 pmol min(-1)mg protein(-1) (V(max)), and 0.12+/-0.02 microl min(-1)mg protein(-1) (CL(int)). Fluvoxamine and diphenytriazol inhibited zolmitriptan N-demethylase activity catalyzed by CYP1A2 (K(i)=3.8+/-0.3 and 3.2+/-0.1 microM, respectively). Diazepam and propranolol elicited a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan (K(i)=70+/-11 and 90+/-18 microM, respectively). Cimetidine and moclobemide produced no significant effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan. Fluvoxamine yielded a k(inactivation) value of 0.16 min(-1), and K(i) of 57 microM. The results suggest that rat hepatic microsomes are a reasonable model to study the metabolism of zolmitriptan, although there is a difference in the amount of minor, inactive metabolites between human hepatic microsomes and rat liver microsomes. The results of the inhibition experiments provided information for the interactions between zolmitriptan and drugs co-administrated in clinic, and it is helpful to explain the drug-drug interactions of clinical relevance on enzyme level. This study aso demonstrated that fluvoxamine may be a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP1A2.", 
    "166": "This is the first report on generalised dystonia beneficially treated by olanzapine. A 63-year-old Taiwanese man with intractable general dystonia was treated with olanzapine starting at a dose of 2.5 mg/day to the maximal dose of 15 mg/day. Clinically, there was slow, but steady, improvement in his dystonia and disability after olanzapine treatment. Evaluation of his dystonia 3 months later revealed 70% improvement on dystonic movement and 60% on disability on the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Scale. The result suggests that treatment with olanzapine can be an alternative therapy for patients with generalised dystonia.", 
    "167": "Studies of organic anterograde amnesia have been central to the development of theories of implicit memory. Pharmacological amnesia provides an additional method for exploring implicit memory, allowing for the experimental manipulation of amnesia and the testing of more participants. A significant concern with pharmacological amnesia is whether its cognitive effects are specific to explicit memory. The current research examines the effects of the benzodiazepine, midazolam, on retrieval from semantic memory and encoding in explicit memory. We focus on midazolam because it holds significant advantages over other benzodiazepines in inducing pharmacological amnesia and prior research suggests it may be useful for testing theories of implicit memory. Our results demonstrate that midazolam does not impair accuracy of retrieval from semantic categories, even when it produces anterograde amnesia for retrieved category items on a later recall test. These results suggest ways midazolam can be used to help test theories of implicit memory.", 
    "168": "The use of typical antipsychotics is limited in children with schizophrenia, owing to the high rate of response failure and early appearance of extrapyramidal syndromes as well as tardive and withdrawal dyskinesia. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine in the treatment of childhood-onset schizophrenia. The study sample included nine children hospitalized for schizophrenia who had proven refractory to treatment with at least two antipsychotic drugs. Olanzapine was administered after a 2-week washout period in gradually increasing doses to a maximum of 5 mg/day on day 5 and 10 mg/day in week 3; six patients received up to 20 mg/day as of week 5. The duration of the study was 12 weeks. Patient psychiatric status was measured with three scales at onset of therapy and thereafter once weekly. Patients also underwent regular blood, laboratory, and liver function tests, and we also monitored their blood pressure and weight and performed electrocardiography and electroencephalography. A reduction in all psychopathology scores was obtained at 12 weeks from baseline. All extrapyramidal symptoms of previous medications resolved, and there were no new incidents. Side effects were mild. There were no adverse changes in blood chemistry, hematological tests, or electrocardiography parameters, but the treatment was associated with a significant weight gain (6.10 +/- 3.25 kg). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in psychiatric symptoms was sustained in eight children. We conclude that olanzapine may have potential as a first-line drug in the treatment of drug-resistant childhood-onset schizophrenia. Large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative studies are needed to clarify the role of the various atypical antipsychotics in both treatment-resistant and treatment-na\u00efve populations with psychotic symptoms/disorders.",

    "170": "Twenty children (age range 6-15 years) with childhood-onset Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) schizophrenia participated. The treating clinician was free to vary or discontinue dosing and use additional medications. Symptoms were assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Child version (BPRS-C), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, temperature, and weight were monitored.", 
    "171": "BPRS-C subscales of thought disturbance and psychomotor excitation, and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms demonstrated significant decreases by 6 weeks of treatment; BPRS-C anxiety and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) showed significant improvement after 1 year of treatment. Seventy-four percent of subjects were considered treatment responders, with a greater than 20% reduction in total BPRS-C score and overall impairment of mild or better. Weight gain (body mass index) was above that expected for normal development in every child. No child developed neuroleptic-related dyskinesias. Seventy-four percent (n = 14) of patients completed this 1-year, open-label trial. Of the 5 subjects who discontinued, weight gain was noted as the reason for 4 subjects.", 
    "172": "Olanzapine appears useful in the treatment of childhood-onset schizophrenia, although there may be a delayed onset of benefit for anxiety and negative symptoms. Weight gain is problematic, but the emergence of dyskinesias may be rare. Additional controlled trials are indicated.", 
    "173": "In a sequence of reactions, methyl mesopyropheophorbide a, mesochlorin e(6) trimethyl ester, mesochlorin p(6) trimethyl ester, mesopurpurin-18-N-hexylimide methyl ester, and mesopurpurin-18-N-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzylimide methyl ester were synthesized from chlorophyll-a. These chlorins on reacting with osmium tetraoxide produced the corresponding vic-dihydroxybacteriochlorins. The 8-vinylchlorins obtained by refluxing the related vic-dihydroxybacteriochlorins in o-dichlorobenzene were individually treated with dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) under Diels-Alder reaction conditions. The intermediate adducts on 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) treatment rearranged to the corresponding stable benzobacteriochlorins, exhibiting the longest wavelength absorption in the range of 737 to 805 nm. In preliminary in vitro (RIF tumor cells) and in vivo screening (C3H/HeJ mice bearing RIF tumors), some of these compounds were found to be quite effective. Under similar treatment conditions (drug dose: 5.0 micromol/kg; light dose: 135 J/cm(2), tumors were exposed to light for 30 min at 24 h postinjection), the benzobacteriochlorins containing N-substituted-imide ring system produced enhanced photosensitizing efficacy with limited skin phototoxicity. These compounds were also found to bind to site II of human serum albumin (HSA). However, no correlation between the binding constant values and photosensitizing efficacy was observed. A competitive intracellular localization study of these novel structures with Rhodamine-123 (a mitochondrial probe) indicated their preferential localization in mitochondria, without producing any specific displacement of (3)H-PK11195 (PBR probe, (3)H-labeled 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide). These results suggest that the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is not the cellular binding site for this class of compounds.",

    "175": "Twenty healthy children who met selection criteria were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups and subsequently treated in a prospective, crossover design. All sedative agents were administered orally, and all sedations included 50% nitrous oxide administered via a nasal hood. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and behavior were recorded at 8 procedural or time periods during the visits. Chi-square and ANOVA were used to analyze the data.",

We compared this technique with halothane-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia using haemodynamic and endocrine stress responses as primary outcomes and adequacy of operating conditions and recovery profile as secondary outcomes.", 
    "179": "Fifty adult patients undergoing radical cystectomy and bladder substitution were randomly assigned to receive either TIVA with KM (n = 25) or halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen anaesthesia (n = 25). Invasive haemodynamic and oxygenation variables were monitored along with plasma cortisol and growth hormone concentrations. Operative conditions and recovery profiles were registered.", 
    "180": "Cardiac index and vascular resistance remained stable during and after surgery. Cortisol concentrations doubled during surgery and remained elevated in the recovery period. Growth hormone increased after induction, peaked during surgery and decreased during recovery. Neither the haemodynamic variables nor the plasma hormone concentrations differed significantly between the two groups. Intestinal loops were collapsed in the KM groups providing better operative conditions and a reduced need for postoperative analgesics.", 
    "181": "The stress responses during KM anaesthesia for prolonged abdominal surgery were comparable to those during halothane-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia. However, KM anaesthesia provided better surgical conditions and better recovery.", 
    "182": "Intrathecal injections of the benzodiazepine midazolam have been reported to cause antinociception in animals and pain relief in human beings, including the potentiation of opioid analgesia. This study compared the efficacy of the addition of midazolam to a mixture of buprenorphine and bupivacaine used for spinal anaesthesia.", 
    "183": "The study was prospective, randomized, and observer blinded. It involved 60 patients (30 per group), ASA I and II, age 20-40 yr, undergoing minor and intermediate lower abdominal surgery under spinal anaesthesia. Patients were randomized into two groups: the control group received a spinal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine (15 mg) plus buprenorphine (0.15 mg) and the experimental group received a spinal injection of the same two drugs and doses but supplemented with intrathecal midazolam (2 mg).", 
    "184": "The duration of postoperative analgesia in the control group was 9.24 +/- 2.57 h (mean +/- SEM), and 21.33 +/- 12.69 h in the midazolam treated group (P < 0.001). Patients treated with intrathecal midazolam had better pain relief judged by visual analogue score on coughing (P = 0.0013) and a nursing mobility score (P < 0.0001). Adverse effects were minor and their incidence was similar in both groups.",

Advanced neoplasia was defined as an adenoma at least 1 cm in diameter, a villous adenoma, an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or invasive cancer. After recovery from sedation all subjects were asked if they would agree to a control colonoscopy and the pain score was recorded on a scale from 0 to 6.",

The prevalence of advanced neoplasia in subjects without/with familiar risk was not significantly different in persons from 50 to 54 years (9 vs. 15 %) in contrast to persons from 55 to 60 years (10 vs. 22 %, p = 0.004) where the relative risk was doubled. Compared to younger patients, the prevalence of all neoplasia (including small adenomas) was significantly different only for older patients with familiar risk (44 vs. 23 %, p < 0.0001). The mean value of the pain-score was 0.76 + 1.0. Subjects examined without medication had significantly higher pain scores than subjects under medication. Colonoscopy performed under disoprivan resulted in similar pain-scores compared to midazolam at dosages > 5 mg. All patients agreed to a control colonoscopy.", 
    "189": "Screening colonoscopy is an effective and well-accepted method. The high prevalence of advanced neoplasia even in persons from 50 to 54 years suggests that screening should start at the age of 50.", 
    "190": "The positive modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptors is a putative mechanism via which alcohol escalates aggressive behavior. Broad-spectrum benzodiazepine antagonists block alcohol-heightened aggression in rats and monkeys. However, the degree to which GABAA subunit composition plays a role in heightened aggressive behavior induced by self-administration of a moderate alcohol dose remains unresolved.", 
    "191": "Beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) and zolpidem act preferentially at GABAA receptors containing the alpha1 subunit as antagonist and agonist, respectively, and serve as useful tools to evaluate the role of GABAA receptor subtypes in self-administered alcohol on aggression.",

Flumazenil or beta-CCt decreased alcohol-heightened and non-heightened aggression in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of 3 mg/kg beta-CCt lowered the aggression-heightening effects of 1 g/kg and 1.7 g/kg EtOH, but did not antagonize the sedative effects of 3.0 g/kg EtOH. Triazolam and zolpidem decreased alcohol-heightened and non-heightened aggressive behavior, and these antiaggressive effects were accompanied by reduced motor activity, indicating sedation.",

    "196": "The objective of this study was to investigate one plausible mechanism whereby RISP and OLZ exert superior effects on cholinergic neurons, i.e. positive effects on nerve growth factor (NGF), which is known to regulate the brain cholinergic activity as well as cognitive function. Therefore, the effects of chronic exposure to HAL, RISP, or OLZ on the expression of NGF and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the hippocampus (i.e. a brain area well known to be involved in cognitive function and known to receive major cholinergic projections from the medial septum) were compared.", 
    "197": "Rats were treated with HAL (1 or 2 mg/kg per day), RISP (1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg per day), or OLZ (5 or 10 mg/kg per day) for 45 days in drinking water. NGF and ChAT were measured by immunohistochemistry and NGF protein was also measured by an enzyme-linked ImmunoSorbent assay.", 
    "198": "Compared to controls, HAL exposure resulted in a marked reduction in NGF immunoreactivity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), CA1 and CA3 areas. In contrast, RISP did not alter, while OLZ significantly increased levels of NGF. These changes in NGF levels corresponded well with changes in ChAT immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and the medial septum.", 
    "199": "These preclinical data, combined with previously published behavioral results, support the premise that OLZ and RISP, in contrast to HAL, preserve cholinergic pathways and cognitive function via superior effects on NGF expression and are thus therapeutically superior for extended use.", 
    "200": "When asked \"How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the ark?\", people fail to notice the distortion introduced by the impostor \"Moses\" and respond \"two\". It has been argued that the effect must be due to the existence of a partial-match process. In most situations, the form of a question is not likely to closely match the memory representation it queries. Thus, for the partial match hypothesis people ignore some semantic distortions. In the same vein, it has been shown that the benzodiazepine lorazepam drug induces some impairments of semantic memory as participants under lorazepam provide more incorrect recalls than placebo do with general information questions.",
