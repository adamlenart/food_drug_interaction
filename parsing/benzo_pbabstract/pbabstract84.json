Elderly patients use a large number of drugs that might have an influence on the upper airway structure, anxiolytics or benzodiazepines being the most common. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of mild or moderate OSA treatment with mandibular advance oral appliance in older lorazepam users compared with the age-matched lorazepam-free patients. A total of 40 functionally independent patients with the age of 65-74 were enrolled in the study. All included patients were found to suffer from at least two of the existing OSA symptoms (snoring, sleep fragmentation, daytime sleepiness) and were diagnosed with mild or moderate OSA after nocturnal polysomnography. Patients were divided into two groups. The experimental group consisted of 20 patients who used lorazepam in their daily therapy, and a control group consisted of 20 patients who did not take lorazepam. A mandibular advance appliance was made individually for each patient. Patients involved in the study were not overweight and were suggested to practise sleeping on the side and reduce alcohol consumption during the study. The study has shown that mandibular advance oral appliances were responsible for complete control of the OSA in over 37% of cases (15 patients). Patients have also reported substantial improvement in the symptoms; 80% of them reported that they had snored less, slept better (94%) and have not experienced daytime sleepiness (100%).", 
    "1": "Delirium (acute confusion) complicates 15% to 50% of major operations in older adults and is associated with other major postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay, poor functional recovery, institutionalization, dementia, and death. Importantly, delirium may be predictable and preventable through proactive intervention. Yet clinicians fail to recognize and address postoperative delirium in up to 80% of cases. Using the case of Ms R, a 76-year-old woman who developed delirium first after colectomy with complications and again after routine surgery, the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of delirium in the postoperative setting is reviewed. The risk of postoperative delirium can be quantified by the sum of predisposing and precipitating factors. Successful strategies for prevention and treatment of delirium include proactive multifactorial intervention targeted to reversible risk factors, limiting use of sedating medications (especially benzodiazepines), effective management of postoperative pain, and, perhaps, judicious use of antipsychotics.", 
    "2": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical and radiological entity. It associates, to varying extents, neurological symptoms such as headaches, confusion, seizures and visual alterations from haemianopsia to cortical blindness. The diagnosis relies on brain MRI, showing signs of subcortical and cortical oedema in the posterior regions of the brain, with hypersignals in T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or diffusion sequences. With early diagnosis and control of the causal factors, the symptoms and radiological signs can be - as the name implies - totally regressive. PRES can be caused by various heterogeneous factors, such as hypertension, side effect of drug therapies, eclampsia, sepsis or autoimmune diseases. The authors report here the case of an 86-year-old woman, presenting totally regressive cortical blindness and seizures, with compatible imaging.",

    "7": "Historically, treatment for schizophrenia focused on sedation. The advent of the typical antipsychotics resulted in treatment aimed specifically at the underlying disease, but these agents were associated with numerous adverse effects, and were not particularly effective at treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. As a result, numerous atypical agents have been developed over the past 2 decades, including several agents within the past 5 years. Overdose of antipsychotics remains quite common in Western society. In 2010, poison control centres in the US received nearly 43,000 calls related to atypical antipsychotics alone. Due to underreporting, the true incidence of overdose with atypical antipsychotics is likely much greater. Following overdose of an atypical antipsychotic, the clinical effects observed, such as CNS depression, tachycardia and orthostasis are largely predictable based on the unique receptor binding profile of the agent. This article, which focuses on the atypical antipsychotics commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia, discusses the features commonly encountered in overdose. Specifically, agents that result in QT prolongation and the corresponding potential for torsades de pointes, as well as unique features encountered with the various medications are discussed. The diagnosis of this overdose is largely based on history. Routine use of drug screens is unlikely to be beneficial. The primary goal of management is aggressive supportive care. Patients with significant CNS depression with associated loss of airway reflexes and respiratory failure need advanced airway management. Hypotension should be treated first with intravenous fluids, with the use of direct acting vasopressors reserved for persistent hypotension. Benzodiazepines should be used for seizures, with barbiturates used for refractory seizures. Intravenous magnesium can be administered for patients with a corrected QT interval exceeding 500 milliseconds.", 
    "8": "Mitochondria dynamically buffer cytosolic Ca(2+) in cardiac ventricular cells and this affects the Ca(2+) load of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In sinoatrial-node cells (SANC) the SR generates periodic local, subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases (LCRs) that depend upon the SR load and are involved in SANC automaticity: LCRs activate an inward Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange current to accelerate the diastolic depolarization, prompting the ensemble of surface membrane ion channels to generate the next action potential (AP).",

    "12": "In the amygdala, GABAergic neurons in the intercalated medial paracapsular cluster (Imp) have been suggested to play a key role in fear learning and extinction. These neurons project to the central (CE) amygdaloid nucleus and to other areas within and outside the amygdala. In addition, they give rise to local collaterals that innervate other neurons in the Imp. Several drugs, including benzodiazepines (BZ), are allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors. BZ has both anxiolytic and sedative actions, which are mediated through GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b12/\u03b13 and \u03b11 subunits, respectively. To establish whether \u03b11 or \u03b12/\u03b13 subunits are expressed at Imp cell synapses, we used paired recordings of anatomically identified Imp neurons and high resolution immunocytochemistry in the mouse. We observed that a selective \u03b13 subunit agonist, TP003 (100 nM), significantly increased the decay time constant of the unitary IPSCs. A similar effect was also induced by zolpidem (10 \u03bcM) or by diazepam (1 \u03bcM). In contrast, lower doses of zolpidem (0.1-1 \u03bcM) did not significantly alter the kinetics of the unitary IPSCs. Accordingly, immunocytochemical experiments established that the \u03b12 and \u03b13, but not the \u03b11 subunits of the GABA(A) receptors, were present at Imp cell synapses of the mouse amygdala. These results define, for the first time, some of the functional GABA(A) receptor subunits expressed at synapses of Imp cells. The data also provide an additional rationale to prompt the search of GABA(A) receptor \u03b13 selective ligands as improved anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "13": "This article proposes a number of recommendations for the treatment of generalized social phobia, based on a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. An optimal treatment regimen would include a combination of medication and psychotherapy, along with an assertive clinical management program. For medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are first-line choices based on their efficacy and tolerability profiles. The nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine, may be more potent than these two drug classes, but because of its food and drug interaction liabilities, its use should be restricted to patients not responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. There are other medication classes with demonstrated efficacy in social phobia (benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, alpha-2-delta ligands), but due to limited published clinical trial data and the potential for dependence and withdrawal issues with benzodiazepines, it is unclear how best to incorporate these drugs into treatment regimens. There are very few clinical trials on the use of combined medications. Cognitive behavior therapy appears to be more effective than other evidence-based psychological techniques, and its effects appear to be more enduring than those of pharmacotherapy. There is some evidence, albeit limited to certain drug classes, that the combination of medication and cognitive behavior therapy may be more effective than either strategy used alone. Generalized social phobia is a chronic disorder, and many patients will require long-term support and treatment.", 
    "14": "This research examined the following questions: (1) how do drug dealers acquire their inventories of prescription medications? and (2) which types of prescription medications do dealers most commonly sell? Data are drawn from a National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded research study that examined prescription drug diversion and abuse in South Florida. In-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 50) were conducted with an ethnically diverse sample of prescription drug dealers from a variety of milieus to assess patterns of diversion. Audiotapes of the interviews were transcribed, coded, and thematically analysed using the NVivo 8 software program. Dealers relied on a wide array of diversion methods including visiting multiple pain clinics, working with pharmacy employees to steal medications from pharmacies, and purchasing medications from indigent patients. The type of medication most commonly sold by dealers was prescription opioid analgesics, and to a lesser extent benzodiazepines such as alprazolam. These findings inform public health policy makers, criminal justice officials, the pharmaceutical industry and government regulatory agencies in their efforts to reduce the availability of diverted prescription drugs in the illicit market. Specifically, these data support the need for statewide prescription drug monitoring programs and increased training for healthcare workers who have access to controlled medications.", 
    "15": "Critically ill patients frequently experience acute brain dysfunction in the form of coma or delirium, both of which are common during acute and chronic critical illness (CCI). These manifestations of brain dysfunction are associated with numerous adverse outcomes during acute critical illness, including prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare costs, and increased mortality. The prognosis of CCI patients with coma or delirium has not yet been thoroughly studied, but preliminary studies suggest this population is at high risk for detrimental outcomes associated with acute brain dysfunction. Additionally, a high percentage of patients who survive acute or CCI suffer from long-term brain dysfunction, which manifests primarily as memory deficits and executive dysfunction and is predicted by brain dysfunction in the ICU. Interventions directed at reducing the burden of brain dysfunction during critical illness have shown promise in studies of patients with acute critical illness, but these therapies have yet to be studied during CCI. Thus, multicenter randomized trials are needed to determine which interventions are most effective for such patients. Until these data are available, management strategies that have been proven beneficial during acute critical illness-such as reduction of sedative exposure, especially to benzodiazepines, and early use of physical and occupational therapy-should be employed during the treatment of patients with CCI.",

    "20": "Solid organ transplantation is frequently complicated by a spectrum of seizure types, including single partial-onset or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, acute repetitive seizures or status epilepticus, and sometimes the evolution of symptomatic epilepsy. There is currently no specific evidence involving the transplant patient population to guide the selection, administration, or duration of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, so familiarity with clinical AED pharmacology and application of sound judgment are necessary for successful patient outcomes. An initial detailed search for symptomatic seizure etiologies, including metabolic, infectious, cerebrovascular, and calcineurin inhibitor treatment-related neurotoxic complications such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), is imperative, as underlying central nervous system disorders may impose additional serious risks to cerebral or general health if not promptly detected and appropriately treated. The mainstay for post-transplant seizure management is AED therapy directed toward the suspected seizure type. Unfavorable drug interactions could place the transplanted organ at risk, so choosing an AED with limited interaction potential is also crucial. When the transplanted organ is dysfunctional or vulnerable to rejection, AEDs without substantial hepatic metabolism are favored in post-liver transplant patients, whereas after renal transplantation, AEDs with predominantly renal elimination may require dosage adjustment to prevent adverse effects. Levetiracetam, gabapentin, pregabalin, and lacosamide are drugs of choice for treatment of partial-onset seizures in post-transplant patients given their efficacy spectrum, generally excellent tolerability, and lack of drug interaction potential. Levetiracetam is the drug of choice for primary generalized seizures in post-transplant patients. When intravenous drugs are necessary for acute seizure management, benzodiazepines and fosphenytoin are the traditional and best evidence-based options, although intravenous levetiracetam, valproate, and lacosamide are emerging options. Availability of several newer AEDs has greatly expanded the therapeutic armamentarium for safe and efficacious treatment of post-transplant seizures, but future prospective clinical trials and pharmacokinetic studies within this specific patient population are needed.",

    "25": "Zoletil(\u00ae) is a 1:1 combination of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, tiletamine, and the benzodiazepine, zolazepam, commonly used as a veterinary anesthetic. There have been previous reports on the abuse of zoletil in humans, and these motivated us to investigate the rewarding and reinforcing effects of the drug. We experimented whether zoletil and its constituents, tiletamine and zolazepam, produces place preference and/or facilitates self-administration. Then we compared the effects of zoletil to that of the recreationally abused veterinary anesthetic, ketamine. We also delved into the consequences of drug pre-exposure, thus parallel experiments were performed on rats pre-treated with the drug for 14 days. Our findings indicated that zoletil produced neither reward nor reinforcement in drug-na\u00efve rats; however, repeated pre-treatment of zoletil produced significant place preference and self-administration. Tiletamine generated both place preference and self-administration; while zolazepam induced place preference but was not self-administered, even in pre-treated animals. The rewarding and reinforcing effects produced by zoletil were comparable to that of ketamine. Therefore, zoletil per se, has no motivational effects but the changes in neuronal functions and behavior consequential to repeated zoletil treatment may contribute in part to the addiction liability of the drug. Furthermore, the present study suggests that complex interactions occur with acute or repeated treatment of an NMDA receptor antagonist-benzodiazepine combination.", 
    "26": "Recent studies have reported that a high-fat diet during pregnancy exerts various effects on the foetus and newborn. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of a high-fat diet during pregnancy on the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 3a in offspring in mice. The protein expression level and activity of Cyp3a in the livers of 6-week-old mice born to mothers that were given a high-fat diet during pregnancy (HF group) decreased significantly compared with the Control group. Triazolam, which is a substrate of Cyp3a, was intraperitoneally administered to the mice in the HF group. Compared with the Control group, an increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and a decrease in total clearance were observed in the HF group. The hepatic constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) mRNA expression level in the HF group was significantly lower than that in the Control group. An increase in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was also observed in the HF group. The results of this study revealed that a high-fat diet during pregnancy causes an increase in ERK phosphorylation and a decrease in the expression level of CAR in the livers of offspring, which leads to decreased Cyp3a expression and activity. The results suggest that individual differences in pharmacokinetics may not only be expressed by genetic predisposition but also by a mother's living environment during pregnancy.",

As a result, we do not know how general anesthetics produce anesthesia at different levels. The main handicap to understanding the mechanisms of general anesthesia is the diversity of chemically unrelated compounds including diethyl ether and halogenated hydrocarbons, gases nitrous oxide, ketamine, propofol, benzodiazepines and etomidate, as well as alcohols and barbiturates. Does this imply that general anesthesia is caused by many different mechanisms Until now, many receptors, molecular targets and neuronal transmission pathways have been shown to contribute to mechanisms of general anesthesia. Among these molecular targets, ion channels are the most likely candidates for general anesthesia, in particular \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A, potassium and sodium channels, as well as ion channels mediated by various neuronal transmitters like acetylcholine, amino acids amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolpropionic acid or N-methyl-D-aspartate. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated the involvement in general anesthesia of other ion channels with distinct gating properties such as hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic- nucleotide-gated channels.

    "36": "The enzymatic pathways leading to the synthesis of bioactive steroids in the brain are now almost completely elucidated in various groups of vertebrates and, during the last decade, the neuronal mechanisms involved in the regulation of neurosteroid production have received increasing attention. This report reviews the current knowledge concerning the effects of neurotransmitters, peptide hormones, and neuropeptides on the biosynthesis of neurosteroids. Anatomical studies have been carried out to visualize the neurotransmitter- or neuropeptide-containing fibers contacting steroid-synthesizing neurons as well as the neurotransmitter, peptide hormones, or neuropeptide receptors expressed in these neurons. Biochemical experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of neurotransmitters, peptide hormones, or neuropeptides on neurosteroid biosynthesis, and to characterize the type of receptors involved. Thus, it has been found that glutamate, acting through kainate and/or AMPA receptors, rapidly inactivates P450arom, and that melatonin produced by the pineal gland and eye inhibits the biosynthesis of 7\u03b1-hydroxypregnenolone (7\u03b1-OH-\u0394(5)P), while prolactin produced by the adenohypophysis enhances the formation of 7\u03b1-OH-\u0394(5)P. It has also been demonstrated that the biosynthesis of neurosteroids is inhibited by GABA, acting through GABA(A) receptors, and neuropeptide Y, acting through Y1 receptors. In contrast, it has been shown that the octadecaneuropetide ODN, acting through central-type benzodiazepine receptors, the triakontatetraneuropeptide TTN, acting though peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, and vasotocin, acting through V1a-like receptors, stimulate the production of neurosteroids. Since neurosteroids are implicated in the control of various neurophysiological and behavioral processes, these data suggest that some of the neurophysiological effects exerted by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides may be mediated via the regulation of neurosteroid production.",

In the above mentioned dose, diazepam causes a strong sedation, but adrenaline does not cause a sedative effects. The combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in threshold independently ineffective doses prevents both clonic-tonic and clonic PTZ seizures in 80 % of rats without a sedation development.

    "43": "Six proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole, were shown to be weak inhibitors of cytochromes P450 (CYP3A4, -2B6, -2D6, -2C9, -2C8, and -1A2) in human liver microsomes. In most cases, IC\u2085\u2080 values were greater than 40 \u03bcM, except for dexlansoprazole and lansoprazole with CYP1A2 (IC\u2085\u2080 = \u223c8 \u03bcM) and esomeprazole with CYP2C8 (IC\u2085\u2080 = 31 \u03bcM). With the exception of CYP2C19 inhibition by omeprazole and esomeprazole (IC\u2085\u2080 ratio, 2.5 to 5.9), there was no evidence for a marked time-dependent shift in IC\u2085\u2080 (IC\u2085\u2080 ratio, \u2264 2) after a 30-min preincubation with NADPH. In the absence of preincubation, lansoprazole (IC\u2085\u2080 = 0.73 \u03bcM) and esomeprazole (IC\u2085\u2080 = 3.7 \u03bcM) were the most potent CYP2C19 inhibitors, followed by dexlansoprazole and omeprazole (IC\u2085\u2080 = \u223c7.0 \u03bcM). Rabeprazole and pantoprazole (IC\u2085\u2080 = \u2265 25 \u03bcM) were the weakest. A similar ranking was obtained with recombinant CYP2C19. Despite the IC\u2085\u2080 ranking, after consideration of plasma levels (static and dynamic), protein binding, and metabolism-dependent inhibition, it is concluded that omeprazole and esomeprazole are the most potent CYP2C19 inhibitors. This was confirmed after the incubation of the individual PPIs with human primary hepatocytes (in the presence of human serum) and by monitoring their impact on diazepam N-demethylase activity at a low concentration of diazepam (2 \u03bcM). Data described herein are consistent with reports that PPIs are mostly weak inhibitors of cytochromes P450 in vivo. However, two members of the PPI class (esomeprazole and omeprazole) are more likely to serve as clinically relevant inhibitors of CYP2C19.",

PNS were defined as the presence of at least one negative symptom of moderate or higher severity, not confounded by depression or parkinsonism, at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. Patients with PNS were compared to those with at least one negative symptom of moderate or higher severity at the baseline, not persisting after 1 year, on demographic, clinical, neurocognitive, global functioning and quality of life measures. PNS not confounded by depression or parkinsonism were present in 6.7% of the sample. The symptom that more often persisted was blunted affect. Patients with PNS differed from those without PNS for a longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and a more frequent discontinuation of study treatment; they also had a poorer psychopathological outcome and a worse global functioning after 1 year of treatment. The presence of PNS was associated to poorer improvement of all psychopathological dimensions and worse global functioning after 1 year of treatment. The longer DUP in subjects with PNS suggests that programs aimed at shortening DUP might reduce the prevalence of PNS and improve prognosis of schizophrenia.", 
    "45": "All stationary phase chemistries are useful to achiral packed-column supercritical fluid chromatography (pSFC), but the majority of recent applications are based on polar stationary phases of the type used in normal-phase HPLC. Some manufacturers have recently introduced pSFC-tailored stationary phases, while others simply advocate the use of selected HPLC columns among their brands for SFC use. Indeed, any column developed for HPLC use can be used with supercritical fluids. Besides, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is facing an increasing interest. Consequently, a number of HILIC-devoted stationary phases are now commercialized by most column manufacturers. As HILIC stationary phases are polar, their possible use in pSFC seems obvious, although literature examples are not numerous. However, whether they provide acceptable peak shapes in SFC conditions is a serious concern for them to find applicability. Indeed, columns optimized for HILIC mobile phases may not be optimum for SFC mobile phases. We present the characterization of eleven HILIC-type stationary phases used with carbon dioxide-methanol mobile phases in the isocratic mode. The columns are compared in terms of their retention and separation characteristics assessed by the solvation parameter model, and based on peak shapes. For this purpose, hundred and forty-six low molecular weight molecules, comprising neutral, basic and acidic compounds, were eluted on each column. Data analysis is carried out with hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis in order to define three clusters of columns with similar selectivity: the first cluster comprises neutral stationary phases like amide and diol phases; the second one comprises basic stationary phases like aminopropyl-bonded silica; the last cluster comprises bare silica stationary phases. Sample applications with three different test mixtures relevant to pharmaceutical applications (barbiturates, benzodiazepines and propionic acids) are presented to assess the complementarity of some selected columns.",

We examined TSPO expression in human thyroid tumors (25 follicular adenomas (FA), 15 follicular cancers (FC), and 70 papillary cancers (PC)). The role of TSPO in the regulation of cell growth, migration, and apoptosis was examined in thyroid cancer cell lines after TSPO knockdown with siRNA and after treatment with TSPO antagonist (PK11195). Compared with normal thyroid, the level of TSPO expression was increased in FA, FC, and PC in 24, 26.6, and 55.7% of cases respectively. Thyroid cancer cell lines demonstrated variable levels of TSPO expression, without specific association with thyroid oncogene mutations. Treatment with inhibitors of PI3K/AKT or MEK/ERK signaling was not associated with changes in TSPO expression. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor (valproic acid) increased TSPO expression in TSPO-deficient cell lines (FTC236 cells). TSPO gene silencing or treatment with PK11195 did not affect thyroid cancer cell growth and migration but prevented depolarization of mitochondrial membranes induced by oxidative stress. Induction of TSPO expression by valproic acid was associated with increased sensitivity of FTC236 to oxidative stress-inducible apoptosis. Overall, we showed that TSPO expression is frequently increased in PC. In vitro data suggested the role of epigenetic mechanism(s) in the regulation of TSPO in thyroid cells. Implication of TSPO in the thyroid cancer cell response to oxidative stress suggested its potential role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cell response to treatment with radioiodine and warrants further investigation.",

This observed efficiency equated to an apparent K(I) between 420 and 480 nM with a maximal inactivation rate (k(inact)) equal to 1.6 min\u207b\u00b9. Similar results were achieved with testosterone, another CYP3A substrate, and other sources of the CYP3A4 enzyme. To further illustrate the abilities of CYP3cide, its partition ratio of inactivation was determined with recombinant CYP3A4. These studies produced a partition ratio approaching unity, thus underscoring the inactivation capacity of CYP3cide. When CYP3cide was tested at a concentration and preincubation time to completely inhibit CYP3A4 in a library of genotyped polymorphic CYP3A5 microsomes, the correlation of the remaining midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity to CYP3A5 abundance was significant (R\u00b2 value equal to 0.51, p value of <0.0001). The work presented here supports these findings by fully characterizing the inhibitory properties and exploring CYP3cide's mechanism of action. To aid the researcher, multiple commercially available sources of CYP3cide were established, and a protocol was developed to quantitatively determine CYP3A4 contribution to the metabolism of an investigational compound. Through the establishment of this protocol and the evidence provided here, we believe that CYP3cide is a very useful tool for understanding the relative roles of CYP3A4 versus CYP3A5 and the impact of CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism on a compound's pharmacokinetics.",

The exposure to 1'-hydroxymidazolam was approximately 14-fold greater than to midazolam in the SCID mice and close to equivalent in the PXB mice. The metabolism of midazolam in SCID mice was faster than in the PXB mice such that pharmacokinetic data for midazolam in SCID mice could not be generated from the lowest dose in these animals. Both oxidative and conjugative metabolic pathways were identified in the PXB mice. All the major circulating metabolites observed in humans; 1'-hydroxymidazolam, 4'-hydroxymidazolam, 1',4'-dihydroxymidazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, were detected in the blood of PXB mice. However, 4'-hydroxymidazolam and the 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide were not detected in blood samples obtained from SCID mice.

    "73": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and highly complex mental illness. Current treatments manage the positive symptoms, yet have minimal effects on the negative and cognitive symptoms, two prominent features of the disease with critical impact on the long-term morbidity. In addition, antipsychotic treatments trigger serious side effects that precipitate treatment discontinuation. Here, we show that activation of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a modulator of monoaminergic neurotransmission, represents a novel therapeutic option. In rodents, activation of TAAR1 by two novel and pharmacologically distinct compounds, the full agonist RO5256390 and the partial agonist RO5263397, blocks psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity and produces a brain activation pattern reminiscent of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine, suggesting antipsychotic-like properties. TAAR1 agonists do not induce catalepsy or weight gain; RO5263397 even reduced haloperidol-induced catalepsy and prevented olanzapine from increasing body weight and fat accumulation. Finally, TAAR1 activation promotes vigilance in rats and shows pro-cognitive and antidepressant-like properties in rodent and primate models. These data suggest that TAAR1 agonists may provide a novel and differentiated treatment of schizophrenia as compared with current medication standards: TAAR1 agonists may improve not only the positive symptoms but also the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, without causing adverse effects such as motor impairments or weight gain.", 
    "74": "Upon binding of cortisol, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates the transcription of specific target genes, including those that encode the stress hormones corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Dysregulation of the stress axis is a hallmark of major depression in human patients. However, it is still unclear how glucocorticoid signaling is linked to affective disorders. We identified an adult-viable zebrafish mutant in which the negative feedback on the stress response is disrupted, due to abolition of all transcriptional activity of GR. As a consequence, cortisol is elevated, but unable to signal through GR. When placed into an unfamiliar aquarium ('novel tank'), mutant fish become immobile ('freeze'), show reduced exploratory behavior and do not habituate to this stressor upon repeated exposure. Addition of the antidepressant fluoxetine to the holding water and social interactions restore normal behavior, followed by a delayed correction of cortisol levels. Fluoxetine does not affect the overall transcription of CRH, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the serotonin transporter (Serta) or GR itself. Fluoxetine, however, suppresses the stress-induced upregulation of MR and Serta in both wild-type fish and mutants. Our studies show a conserved, protective function of glucocorticoid signaling in the regulation of emotional behavior and reveal novel molecular aspects of how chronic stress impacts vertebrate brain physiology and behavior. Importantly, the zebrafish model opens up the possibility of high-throughput drug screens in search of new classes of antidepressants.", 
    "75": "The safest pain treatment strategy for an individual at risk or recovering from addiction is a nonopioid and benzodiazepine-free approach. If an opioid treatment is necessary, the extent of the risk can be stratified by the use of a biopsychosocial assessment and opioid screening tools. Individuals at high risk should have the greatest amount of structure and monitoring. A written informed consent and treatment agreement can provide a framework for the patient and the patient\u2019s family, as well as the clinician. The structure of treatment should specify only that one prescribing physician will write a limited supply of opioids, without refills, until the analgesic efficacy, adverse events, and goals for functional restoration can be assessed. An additional recommendation is that prescriptions should be filled at the same pharmacy with no refill by phone or opportunity for replacement because of loss, damage, or stolen medications. Additionally, random urine drug screens and PDMP reports obtained will help determine if the patient is taking other substances, as well as monitor the patient\u2019s medication use patterns. It is important to assess for risk factors in treating chronic pain with opioids; clinicians need to have a realistic appreciation of the resources available to them and the types of patients that can be managed in their practice. Chronic pain treatment with opioids should not be undertaken in patients who are currently addicted to illicit substances or alcohol. With the support of family and friends, ideally the patient can be motivated to participate in an intensive substance abuse treatment. In patients without an immediate risk, precautionary steps should be taken when prescribing opioids. Clinicians and patients need to review the risk factors for opioid-related problems including younger age, benzodiazepine use, and comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, and heavy smoking. Both the provider and the patient need a personal investment in the treatment plan and protocol to increase the safety of opioid treatment. New medications and treatment monitoring are being developed to provide maximal relief for the patient while protecting the public health. The optimal ingredients for safe opioid treatment include a strong provider-patient relationship and clinician training in the assessment and treatment of addiction and pain.",

    "82": "Permeability-limited two-subcompartment and flow-limited, well-stirred tank tissue compartment models are routinely used in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling. Here, the permeability-limited two-subcompartment model is used to derive a general flow-limited case of a two-subcompartment model with the well-stirred tank being a specific case where tissue fractional blood volume approaches zero. The general flow-limited two-subcompartment model provides a clear distinction between two partition coefficients typically used in PBPK: a biophysical partition coefficient and a well-stirred partition coefficient. Case studies using diazepam and cotinine demonstrate that, when the well-stirred tank is used with a priori predicted biophysical partition coefficients, simulations overestimate or underestimate total organ drug concentration relative to flow-limited two-subcompartment model behavior in tissues with higher fractional blood volumes. However, whole-body simulations show predicted drug concentrations in plasma and lower fractional blood volume tissues are relatively unaffected. These findings point to the importance of accurately determining tissue fractional blood volume for flow-limited PBPK modeling. Simulations using biophysical and well-stirred partition coefficients optimized with flow-limited two-subcompartment and well-stirred models, respectively, lead to nearly identical fits to tissue drug distribution data. Therefore, results of whole-body PBPK modeling with diazepam and cotinine indicate both flow-limited models are appropriate PBPK tissue models as long as the correct partition coefficient is used: the biophysical partition coefficient is for use with two-subcompartment models and the well-stirred partition coefficient is for use with the well-stirred tank model.",

In all models, except Vogel's conflict test, a dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effect was seen. The anti-hyperthermic effect of Lu AF21934 (5 mg/kg) in the SIH test was inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg) and was not serotonin-dependent, as it persisted in serotonin-deficient mice and upon blockade of either 5-HT(1A) receptors by WAY100635, or 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors by ritanserin. These results suggest that the GABAergic system, but not the serotonergic system, is involved in the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like phenotype of Lu AF21934 in rodents.

Both patients experienced prolonged sinus tachycardia that, in one patient, was relatively resistant to both beta- and calcium channel blockade. Both patients were found to have elevated troponin levels, the first patient as high as 4.71 ng/mL (normal<0.04 ng/mL). Further investigation revealed normal coronary arteries at catheterization and normal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the first patient, and normal echocardiograms for both patients. The tachycardia gradually resolved and both patients recovered uneventfully. The etiology of cardiac ischemia in these patients is uncertain.",

There were no significant differences between olanzapine and clozapine in RCTs or observational studies. All-cause discontinuation rates in RCTs were significantly lower for olanzapine compared to all comparators except amisulpride and clozapine. In observational studies, olanzapine was less effective than clozapine.

It was shown that \u03b11-subunit affinity-selective antagonist \u03b2-CCt almost completely abolished spatial learning deficits induced by diazepam (DZP) in the Morris water maze. We examined a novel, highly (105 fold) \u03b11-subunit selective ligand-WYS8 (0.2, 1 and 10 mg/kg), on its own and in combination with the non-selective agonist DZP (2 mg/kg) or \u03b2-CCt (5 mg/kg) in the water maze in rats. The in vitro efficacy study revealed that WYS8 acts as \u03b11-subtype selective weak partial positive modulator (40% potentiation at 100nM). Measurement of concentrations of WYS8 and DZP in rat serum and brain tissues suggested that they did not substantially cross-influence the respective disposition. In the water maze, DZP impaired spatial learning (acquisition trials) and memory (probe trial). WYS8 caused no effect per se, did not affect the overall influence of DZP on the water-maze performance and was devoid of any activity in this task when combined with \u03b2-CCt. Nonetheless, an additional analysis of the latency to reach the platform and the total distance swam suggested that WYS8 addition attenuated the run-down of the spatial impairment induced by DZP at the end of acquisition trials. These results demonstrate a clear difference in the influence of an \u03b11 subtype-selective antagonist and a partial agonist on the effects of DZP on the water-maze acquisition.",

Opioids (41.1%) were the drugs most commonly abused by the patients, followed by benzodiazepines (32.1%). More than two-thirds of the patients (n=38, 67.9%) required hospitalization, and three patients died (5.4%). In contrast, 110 patients with drug abuse-related accidents visited the ED at CMUH during the study period. Most of these subjects had abused benzodiazepines (69.1%), were between 21 and 40 years old, and were female. Fewer than one-fifth of the patients (n=19, 17.3%) required hospitalization, with no deaths reported.

AIM.\u2002 We investigated whether young children's behaviour improves during dental treatment with oral ketamine/midazolam compared with midazolam alone or no sedation. DESIGN.\u2002 Healthy children under 36\u2003months of age, presenting early childhood caries were randomly assigned to receive protective stabilization plus: combined oral midazolam (0.5\u2003mg/kg) and ketamine (3\u2003mg/kg) (MK), or oral midazolam (1.0\u2003mg/kg) (MS), or no sedative (PS). One observer scored children's behaviour using the Ohio State University Behavior Rating Scale (OSUBRS) at determined points in a dental exam (no sedative) and treatment session. Data were analysed using nonparametric bivariate tests. RESULTS.\u2002 Forty-one children were included. In the dental exam session, the sum of OSUBRS scores was similar for the three groups (P\u2003=\u20030.81). In the treatment session, the MK produced more cooperative behaviour than MS and PS (P\u2003=\u20030.01), longer sessions (P\u2003=\u20030.04), and a pattern of homogeneous OSUBRS scores from the reception area (before sedative administration) to the end of the session (P\u2003=\u20030.06). No immediate and post-discharge side effects were observed in groups MK and MS. CONCLUSIONS.\u2002 The combination of oral midazolam and ketamine is efficacious for guiding the behaviour of children under 3\u2003years old.",

Metabolic data were also confronted to histopathological results obtained using the same experimental conditions. Soman, when not lethal, can induce status epilepticus (SE), brain damage, histological lesions, and profound cerebral metabolic disorders as revealed using (1)H HRMAS NMR. Our challenge was to evaluate delayed treatments, which could control refractory SE and avoid brain lesions. For this aim, we have built a statistical model of soman intoxication describing brain metabolite evolution during 7 days. We have then used this model to evaluate the efficiency of a combination of ketamine/atropine (KET/AS) administrated 1 and 2 h after SE induction, compared to the immediate anticonvulsant therapy midazolam/atropine sulfate (MDZ/AS). Furthermore, quantitation of HRMAS NMR data allowed us to follow individual evolution of 17 metabolites. N-Acetylaspartate, lactate, or taurine presented a long lasting disruption, while glutamine, alanine, glycerophosphocholine and myo-inositol showed disruptions for 3 days with a reversion at day 7. These changes were completely normalized by the administration of MDZ/AS. Interestingly, they were also almost completely reversed by KET/AS 1 h postsoman. This work suggests further the predictive interest of HRMAS and PLS-DA for neuropathology/neuroprotection studies and also confirms, on the metabolic aspects, the neuroprotective potentials of KET/AS combinations for the delayed treatment of soman-induced SE.",

    "156": "In 2008, the number of poisoning deaths exceeded the number of motor vehicle traffic deaths and was the leading cause of injury death for the fi rst time since at least 1980. During the past three decades, the poisoning death rate nearly tripled, while the motor vehicle traffic death rate decreased by one-half. During this period, the percentage of poisoning deaths that were caused by drugs increased from about 60% to about 90%. The population groups with the highest drug poisoning death rates in 2008 were males, people aged 45\u201354 years, and non-Hispanic white and American Indian or Alaska Native persons. The vast majority of drug poisoning deaths are unintentional (see Appendix table). Opioid analgesics were involved in more drug poisoning deaths than other specified drugs, including heroin and cocaine. Opioid analgesics were involved in nearly 15,000 deaths in 2008, while cocaine was involved in about 5,100 deaths and heroin was involved in about 3,000 deaths (data not shown). Deaths involving opioid analgesics may involve other drugs as well, including benzodiazepines (2). In addition to an increase in the number of deaths caused by drug poisoning, increases in drug use, abuse, misuse, and nonfatal health outcomes have been observed. In the past two decades, there has been an increase in the distribution and medical use of prescription drugs, including opioid analgesics (3). From 1999 to 2008, the use of prescription medications increased (4). In 2007\u20132008, 48% of Americans used at least one prescription drug in the past month and 11% of Americans used five or more prescriptions in the past month. Analgesics for pain relief were among the common drugs taken by adults aged 20\u201359 years (4). In 2009\u20132010, over 5 million Americans reported using prescription pain relievers nonmedically in the past month (that is, without a doctor\u2019s prescription or only for the experience or feeling they caused), and the majority of people using prescription pain relievers nonmedically reported getting the drugs from friends or family (5,6). From 2004 to 2008, the estimated rate of emergency department visits involving nonmedical use of opioid analgesics doubled from 49 per 100,000 to 101 per 100,000 (7). Government agencies and other organizations joined together to achieve great reductions in the number of deaths from motor vehicle crashes in the past three decades (8,9). A comprehensive approach, including improvements in the safety of vehicles; improvements in roadways; increased use of restraint systems, such as seat belts and child safety seats; reductions in speed; and also efforts to reduce driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, contributed to the decline in motor vehicle related deaths (8,9).

    "157": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a multifunctional protein mainly found on the outer mitochondrial membrane. PBR expression is increased by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in endothelial cells. Adenoviral overexpression of PBR inhibits monocyte adhesion, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 expression in TNF-\u03b1-activated endothelial cells. Rotenone, cyclosporine A, and bongkrekic acid suppress TNF-\u03b1-induced VCAM-1 expression. Overexpression of PBR inhibits voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1) expression and the silencing of PBR increases VDAC-1 expression in endothelial cells. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1-induced VCAM-1 expression is suppressed by VDAC-1 gene silencing. PBR overexpression significantly decreases TNF-\u03b1-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and MnSOD expression. These results suggest that PBR can inhibit endothelial activation and this action is related to the inhibition of mitochondrial ROS and/or VDAC-1 expression in endothelial cells.",

BCM-like metaplasticity over a shorter timescale has also been observed in the hippocampus, thus providing a tractable experimental preparation for testing specific predictions of the model. Here, using extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological recordings from acute rat hippocampal slices, we tested the critical BCM predictions (1) that high levels of synaptic activation will induce a metaplastic state that spreads across dendritic compartments, and (2) that postsynaptic cell-firing is the critical trigger for inducing that state. In support of the first premise, high-frequency priming stimulation inhibited subsequent long-term potentiation and facilitated subsequent long-term depression at synapses quiescent during priming, including those located in a dendritic compartment different to that of the primed pathway. These effects were not dependent on changes in synaptic inhibition or NMDA/metabotropic glutamate receptor function. However, in contrast to the BCM prediction, somatic action potentials during priming were neither necessary nor sufficient to induce the metaplasticity effect. Instead, in broad agreement with derivatives of the BCM model, calcium as released from intracellular stores and triggered by M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation was critical for altering subsequent synaptic plasticity. These results indicate that synaptic plasticity in stratum radiatum of CA1 can be homeostatically regulated by the cell-wide history of synaptic activity through a calcium-dependent but action potential-independent mechanism.", 
    "217": "The rat fear-potentiated startle (FPS) paradigm is a translational model of conditioned fear involving central amygdala pathways of the brain. Hypothalamic orexin neurons have input-output projections to the amygdala; they modulate vigilance and stress-related responses.", 
    "218": "To investigate whether the transient pharmacological blockade of orexin receptors moderates the conditioned fear response.", 
    "219": "F344 rats received acute oral treatment with the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant (30-300 mg/kg) or with one of the clinically effective anxiolytics diazepam (1-10 mg/kg), buspirone (10-100 mg/kg), fluoxetine (3-30 mg/kg), and sertraline (10-100 mg/kg). Drug effects on startle responses were assessed in both fear- and non-fear-conditioned rats; on forepaw grip and horizontal wire motor performance, and on elevated plus maze (EPM) behavior.", 
    "220": "Diazepam and almorexant both dose-dependently decreased FPS in the presence of the fear-conditioned stimulus (CS; light) more prominently than background startle in absence of the CS (dark). Diazepam induced myorelaxation and reduced startle responses in control non-fear-conditioned rats. Almorexant had no myorelaxant effects and left startle responses under light in non-fear-conditioned rats intact. On the EPM, diazepam showed anxiolytic-like effects, almorexant not. Buspirone demonstrated anxiolytic-like effects on FPS by simultaneously reducing CS-related startle and increasing no-CS-background startle. Fluoxetine did not affect FPS, whereas sertraline showed anxiogenic-like effects.", 
    "221": "Almorexant reduced FPS, but did not affect EPM behavior. Almorexant's overall pattern of effects on FPS was comparable to but less pronounced than that of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam. The endogenous orexin system actively contributes to fear-conditioned startle reactions in the rat.", 
    "222": "Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s; some have shown efficacy in treating different neuropathic pain conditions. Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, is an established antiepileptic drug, but its place in the treatment of neuropathic pain is unclear.", 
    "223": "To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of the antiepileptic drug clonazepam in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.", 
    "224": "We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2). MEDLINE, and EMBASE to 28 February 2012, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov.", 
    "225": "We planned to include randomised, double-blind studies of eight weeks duration or longer, comparing clonazepam with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.", 
    "226": "Two review authors would independently extract data for efficacy and adverse events, and examine issues of study quality.", 
    "227": "We did not identify any studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.", 
    "228": "This review uncovered no evidence of sufficient quality to support the use of clonazepam in chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.", 
    "229": "Sedatives have been increasingly used to improve patient comfort during flexible bronchoscopy (FOB). Due to its rapid-onset, anxiolytic and amnestic properties, midazolam is one of the most commonly used sedatives.", 
    "230": "To evaluate the effect of sedation with midazolam, including patient tolerance, complications and its potential use on a daily routine basis.", 
    "231": "A multi-centre, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was made on 100 patients submitted to FOB in two Pulmonology Departments. Midazolam (0.05mg/kg) was administered to patients in Group 1 and saline solution (0,9% NaCl) to patients in Group 2, five minutes before the procedure. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) was used to determine patient anxiety level. Subjective questionnaires concerning main fears and complaints were answered before and after FOB.", 
    "232": "Mean age was 56.0 \u00b1 14.1 years; 66% male. Most (65%) patients had low score (<7) in HADS-A scale with no difference between groups. No significant differences were seen between groups concerning FOB duration, procedures, lidocaine dosage and complications. Systolic blood pressure during and after FOB was significantly higher (p<0.003) in Group 2. Patients in Group 1 experienced less cough (32% vs 56%; p=0.03) and dyspnea (2% vs 34%; p<0.001) than in Group 2, while nausea (6% vs 18%; p>0.05) and pain (4% vs 12%; p>0.05) were not statistically different. Willingness to repeat the exam was reported in all patients in Group 1 and in 82% in Group 2 (p=0.003).", 
    "233": "Sedation with midazolam in FOB improved patient's comfort and decreased complaints, without significant haemodynamic changes. It should be offered to the patient on a routine basis.", 
    "234": "The aim of this research was to measure the longitudinal effects of having children in a client's custodial care, on opioid treatment outcomes. A 3 year national, longitudinal study was implemented. Outcomes were measured using the Maudsley Addiction Profile, 404 clients (75% male) were recruited and 97% were located at 3 years. At 1 year significantly fewer of those with children in their care were using heroin, benzodiazepines and cannabis but having children in a client's care at intake was a significant and positive predictor of using other opioids at 1 year. Analysis also revealed that there was a significant reduction in the proportion using alcohol in the last 90 days and in the mean days alcohol was used among those with no children in their care. Results demonstrate that having children in a client's care improves outcomes for heroin use but also suggest the possible use of substitution substances.", 
    "235": "The electron conformational and genetic algorithm methods (EC-GA) were integrated for the identification of the pharmacophore group and predicting the anti HIV-1 activity of tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepinone (TIBO) derivatives. To reveal the pharmacophore group, each conformation of all compounds was arranged by electron conformational matrices of congruity. Multiple comparisons of these matrices, within given tolerances for high active and low active TIBO derivatives, allow the identification of the pharmacophore group that refers to the electron conformational submatrix of activity. The effects of conformations, internal and external validation were investigated by four different models based on an ensemble of conformers and a single conformer, both with and without a test set. Model 1 using an ensemble of conformers for the training (39 compounds) and test sets (13 compounds), obtained by the optimum seven parameters, gave satisfactory results (R\u00b2(training) = 0.878, R\u00b2(test)= 0.910, q\u00b2 = 0.840, q\u00b2(ext1) = 0.926 and q\u00b2(ext2) = 0.900).", 
    "236": "Bipolar disorder has a significant impact upon a patient's quality of life, imposing a considerable economic burden on the individual, family members and society as a whole. Several medications are indicated for the acute treatment of mania and depression associated with bipolar disorder as well as for maintenance therapy; however, these have varying efficacy, tolerability and costs.", 
    "237": "The objective of this study was to develop a new discrete-event simulation model to analyse the long-term consequences of pharmacological therapy for the management of bipolar I and II disorders (acute treatment of episodes of mania and depression as well as maintenance therapy).", 
    "238": "Probabilities of remission and relapse were obtained from clinical trial data and meta-analyses. Costs (year 2011 values) were assessed from a UK healthcare payer's perspective, and included pharmacological therapy and resource use associated with the treatment of mood events and selected adverse events. The health effects were measured in terms of QALYs.", 
    "239": "For a patient starting with acute depression or in remission at 40 years of age (which was the average age in the clinical trials), quetiapine 300\u2009mg/day was a cost-effective strategy compared with olanzapine 15\u2009mg/day over a 5-year time frame. With acute bipolar depression as a starting episode, the 5-year medical costs were \u00a3323 higher and QALYs were 0.038 higher for quetiapine compared with olanzapine, corresponding to a cost-effectiveness ratio of \u00a38600 per QALY gained.",

    "242": "Retrospective studies of inpatients with cancer suggest that a cancer diagnosis confers a high risk of falls. In adults with advanced cancer, we aimed to prospectively document the incidence of falls, identify the risk factors, and determine if falls in this population occur predominantly in older patients.", 
    "243": "Patients admitted consecutively to community and inpatient palliative care services with metastatic or locoregionally advanced cancer who were mobile without assistance were recruited. Risk-factor assessment was conducted on initial encounter. Patients underwent follow-up via weekly telephone contact for 6 months or until time of fall or death. Relationship between covariates and time to fall was examined using hazard ratios (HRs) derived from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.", 
    "244": "Of 185 participants (52.4% men; mean age 68 \u00b1 standard deviation of 12.6 years), 50.3% fell; 35 (53%) of 66 participants age < 65 years and 58 (48.7%) of 119 age \u2265 65 years fell; 61.3% of falls occurred in the community; 42% resulted in injury. Median time to fall was 96 days (95% CI, 64.66 to 127.34). Primary brain tumor or brain metastasis (HR 2.5; P = .002), number of falls in the preceding 3 months (HR, 1.27; P = .005), severity of depression (HR, 1.12; P = .012), benzodiazepine dose (HR, 1.05; P = .004), and cancer-related pain (HR, 1.96; P = .024) were independently associated with time to fall in multivariate analysis.", 
    "245": "Fifty percent of adults with advanced cancer, regardless of age, will experience a fall associated with high risk of physical injury. There is a compelling need to assess the efficacy of assessment and management of modifiable fall risk factors in patients with advanced cancer."
