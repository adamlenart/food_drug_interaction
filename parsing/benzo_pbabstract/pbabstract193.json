In vivo studies in stroke patients have relied on positron emission tomography and (R)-PK11195, a ligand that binds peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. In this study we sought to establish temporal and spatial patterns of microglial activation in ischemic stroke with particular emphasis on a defined peri-infarct zone.",

[11C](R)-PK11195 injection was followed by 3-dimensional acquisition over 60 minutes. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) was measured afterward with the use of standard C15O paradigms. Analysis employed the reference tissue model in which ipsilateral cerebellum was used to generate parametric binding potential maps corrected for CBV. Data were coregistered to T1-based MRI. Using control data to identify 99% confidence limits, a region of interest analysis was applied to identify significant binding in core infarction, contralateral hemisphere, and within a defined peri-infarct zone.",

    "5": "Blockade of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors in the rat spinal cord diminishes the development of hyperalgesia and allodynia associated with peripheral injury. Cobalt uptake studies reveal that Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors are expressed by some substance P receptor-expressing (NK1R+) neurons in lamina I, as well as other neurons throughout the superficial dorsal horn. Selective elimination of NK1R+ neurons in lamina I and lamina III/IV of the dorsal horn also suppresses development of hyperalgesia and allodynia. These observations raise the possibility that Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors contribute to excitatory synaptic drive onto the NK1R+ neurons associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. The first synapse in the pain pathway is the glutamatergic excitatory drive from the primary afferent fibres onto dorsal horn neurons. Therefore, we tested whether Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors are located on lamina I and lamina III/IV NK1R+ neurons postsynaptic to primary afferent fibres, using inward rectification and polyamine toxins for receptor identification. We examined three different populations of dorsal horn neurons; lamina I NK1R+ neurons, including projection neurons, and non-NK1R+ (NK1R-) neurons including interneurons, and lamina III/IV NK1R+ neurons, believed to contribute to the low-threshold mechanosensory pathway. The majority of synapses in all three groups had rectification indices less than 1.0 and greater than 0.4, indicating that the AMPA receptors at these synapses are a mixture of Ca2+-permeable and -impermeable forms. Lamina III/IV NK1R+ neurons and lamina I NK1R- neurons have a significantly higher proportion of postsynaptic Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors than lamina I NK1R+ neurons. Thus synaptically positioned Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors directly contribute to low-threshold sensory afferent drive into the dorsal horn, and can mediate afferent input onto interneurons such as GABAergic neurons. These receptors also contribute to high-threshold primary afferent drive onto NK1R+ neurons in the superficial dorsal horn, but do so less consistently.", 
    "6": "The objective of the study was to examine whether patients with schizophrenia who were judged to be stable on long-term treatment with conventional antipsychotic medications would further benefit from a switch to an atypical antipsychotic drug. Thirty-six subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, on conventional antipsychotic medication therapy for at least 2 years, were randomized in double-blind fashion to risperidone versus olanzapine. Patients were titrated up to 6 mg risperidone or 15 mg olanzapine as tolerated, followed by tapering and discontinuation of conventional antipsychotic medication. Atypical antipsychotic agents were then administered alone (monotherapy) for 12 weeks. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale, and Simpson Angus Scale. Body weight was measured at each visit. Both treatment groups exhibited marked and similar improvement in the total PANSS score from baseline to study endpoint (22 weeks) [risperidone: baseline=59.3 (SE 3.1), 22 weeks=44.3 (SE 2.3) (p<0.001); olanzapine: baseline=55.9 (SE 3.3), 22 weeks=46.9 (SE 3.2) (p<0.001). Both groups also exhibited significant reductions in PANSS factor scores for positive and negative symptoms and disorganized thoughts. Only risperidone-treated patients exhibited significant decreases in uncontrolled hostility/excitement and anxiety and depression. Of note, while positive factor scores exhibited the majority of change within the first 10 weeks, negative factor scores continued to decline significantly in both treatment groups throughout the study. Tolerability assessments did not differ between groups. The results indicate that both atypical antipsychotic medications provided significant additional improvement in symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia previously on conventional antipsychotic agents.",

The patients were evaluated at baseline and at the sixth and twelfth week according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), body mass index (BMI), and fasting serum prolactin, leptin, lipids and lipoproteins levels. Treatment of patients with olanzapine caused marked increase of serum LDL, cholesterol, triglyceride, and leptin levels (p<0,02). No changes in HDL concentrations. There was positive relationship between serum leptin, lipid levels and BMI. However, treatment of patients with seroquel did not cause changes in serum prolactin, leptin, lipids, and lipoproteins levels.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which glutamate releases ATP from cultured spinal cord microglia. The 4-fold increase in ATP release from microglia in response to glutamate (0.5 mM) was blocked by alpha-aminohydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-proprionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroguinoxaline-2,3-dione and specific AMPA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466) but not by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid or metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Glutamate acting on AMPA receptors evoked an ATP release that was blocked by antagonizing the rise in intracellular Ca2+ as a result of its release from internal stores as well as by antagonizing protein kinase C with chelerythrine. Glutamate-stimulated ATP release was significantly antagonized by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blockers flufenamic acid and glibenclamide. A role for the CFTR was further confirmed using microglia from CFTR knockout mice, which released significantly less ATP than microglia from control wild-type mice in response to glutamate. Use of 6-methoxy-1-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium fluorescence assay revealed functional CFTR in microglia. These observations suggest that glutamate acted on microglial AMPA receptors to stimulate release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores as well as a Ca2+-dependent isoform of protein kinase C, which then acts to trigger release of ATP with the CFTR acting as a regulator of the ATP release process, perhaps through another channel or transporter.",

Intra-lateral septal infusions of MTEP induced a dose-dependent (5.0 microg/microl, P<0.05; 10.0 microg/microl, P<0.05) increase in reinforced lever presses and a cohesive rightward shift of the inter-response time distribution (5.0 microg/microl, P<0.05; 10.0 microg/microl, P<0.05). These effects are indicative of antidepressant-like actions of the compound. Desipramine, a prototypical antidepressant drug, induced (5.0 microg/microl; P<0.05) similar effects. In the elevated plus-maze test, intra-lateral septal infusions of MTEP (5.0 microg/microl, P<0.05; 10.0 microg/microl, P<0.05) increased the exploration of the open arms without affecting locomotion. This anxiolytic-like effect was similar to that observed with the infusion of the benzodiazepine midazolam (10.0 microg/microl; P<0.05) in the same brain area. It is concluded that intra-lateral septal infusions of the mGlu5 receptor antagonist MTEP produced antidepressant-like actions or anxiolytic-like effects in male rats.",

In the past, many studies investigating the effect of diazepam in peripheral vestibular destruction have been reported. However, no previous study has yet investigated the effect of diazepam on a model with a transient and reversible vestibular function similar to recurrent vertigo as seen in Meniere's disease. We thus made a peripheral vestibular re-input model by the unilateral intracochlear administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) using an osmotic pump and then examined the influence of diazepam on the vestibular system in this model. Hartley white guinea pigs were intracochlearly administered with TTX on the right side for 3 days by an osmotic pump. Animals were divided into three groups, TTX alone (control group (n = 7)), TTX and an intraperitoneal diazepam injection once a day for 3 days (diazepam group (n = 6)) and vehicle injection (vehicle group (n = 6)). A caloric response and vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) were observed at 7 and 14 days after completing 3 days of TTX administration. Seven days after vestibular re-input, a directional preponderance of the nystagmus (DP) to the TTX-treated side was observed in the control and vehicle groups on VOR examination. DP was not observed in the diazepam group on any examined day. The R/L time ratio of caloric response showed no statistical difference between three groups on any examined day. These results suggest that diazepam may thus be useful for patients in an acute stage of peripheral vestibular vertigo by decreasing their vertiginous symptoms.",

Stout, 2002) was applied to individual-participant data from these studies, for the highest administered dose of all 3 drugs and corresponding placebo doses, to determine changes in decision-making processes that may be uniquely engendered by each drug. The model includes 3 parameters: responsiveness to rewards and losses (valence or motivation); the rate of updating expectancies about the value of risky alternatives (learning/memory); and the consistency with which trial-by-trial choices match expected outcomes (sensitivity). Parameter estimates revealed 3 key outcomes: Alcohol increased responsiveness to risky rewards and decreased responsiveness to risky losses (motivation) but did not alter expectancy updating (learning/memory); both marijuana and alprazolam produced increases in risk taking that were related to learning/memory but not motivation; and alcohol and marijuana (but not alprazolam) produced more random response patterns that were less consistently related to expected outcomes on the 2 choices.

Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is a subjective report of insufficient or nonrestorative sleep despite adequate opportunity to sleep. Despite the fact that more than 50% of elderly people have insomnia, it is typically undertreated, and nonpharmacologic interventions are underused by health care practitioners.

    "59": "In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), progestins facilitate lordosis via actions at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GBRs) and dopamine type 1 receptors (D1). The relationship between progestins' actions at GBRs and D1 in the VTA for facilitating sexual behavior of hamsters and rats was examined. Ovariectomized (ovx), estradiol (E(2); 10 microg)+progesterone (P; 250 microg; SC)-primed hamsters, with bilateral guide cannulae to the VTA, were pre-tested for sexual and motor behavior and infused with the GBR antagonist bicuculline (100 ng/side) or vehicle. Thirty minutes later, hamsters were re-tested and then infused with the D1 agonist SKF38393 (100 ng/side) or vehicle. Hamsters were post-tested 30 min later. Ovx, E(2) (10 microg)-primed rats were pre-tested, infused first with bicuculline or vehicle, second with SKF38393 or vehicle, third with 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP; 0, 100, or 200 ng) and were post-tested 10 and 60 min after 3alpha,5alpha-THP infusions. VTA infusions of SKF38393 increased lordosis of hamsters or rats. Bicuculline pretreatment reduced SKF38393- and/or progesterone-mediated increases in lordosis of E2-primed hamsters. In E2-primed rats, bicuculline blocked SKF38393- and/or 3alpha,5alpha-THP-mediated increases in lordosis. There were no effects on motor behavior. Thus, in the VTA, GBR activity modulates D1-mediated actions for lordosis of hamsters and rats.",

Under our experimental conditions, it takes between 3 and 4 post-training hours for the rats and between 1 and 2 post-training hours for the mice to forget the respective value of the objects. In the second experiment, the effects of scopolamine (0.03-1 mg/kg) were investigated in both rats and mice when administered 30 min prior to training in the object recognition task. Memory retention was tested 2 h after training in rats and 1 h after training in mice. Scopolamine impairs the object recognition memory at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg in rats and at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg in mice. In the last experiment, effects of two benzodiazepines (alprazolam and diazepam) were assessed in the mouse model of object recognition task. Diazepam and alprazolam were intraperitoneally administered 30 min prior to training and memory retention was tested 10 min and 1 h after training. At 0.2 mg/kg, both benzodiazepines impair object recognition memory when testing is performed 1 h after training. However, when testing is performed 10 min after training, both benzodiazepines at 0.2 mg/kg failed to disrupt memory processes.",

One retrospective study demonstrates the efficacy of physostigmine in reversing mental status changes induced by olanzapine. We report two patients with delirium due to confirmed olanzapine overdose treated with physostigmine. One patient's mental status transiently returned to normal. The other patient completely recovered. CASE 1: A 25-year-old man ingested 300 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, he was agitated, delirious, tachycardic, had dry skin and mucous membranes, and dilated pupils (6 mm) minimally reactive to light. Physostigmine, 0.5 mg, was given intravenously (IV) without effect. Additional physostigmine doses of 1.5 mg IV administered 5 minutes later and then 1 mg IV resulted in the patient having a clear sensorium and normal mentation. The patient's mental status continued to remain normal for the duration of his hospital stay. Olanzapine was identified in the urine by high performance liquid chromatography. CASE 2: A 20-year-old female ingested 600 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, she was tachycardic, obtunded, and minimally responsive to painful stimuli, with decreased bowel sounds, dry skin and dry mucous membranes. Physostigmine, 2 mg, was given IV. Shortly thereafter she regained full consciousness and began speaking coherently. She remained in this condition for approximately 30 minutes, and then became obtunded.

    "69": "In 2003, there were 28,092 human exposures to diphenhydramine reported to poison centers in the US. A related drug, dimenhydrinate, is a less frequent cause of poisonings. Between January 2000 and June 2004, there were 2,534 reported dimenhydrinate ingestions in children less than 6 years of age. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create this guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft was created by the primary author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with a suspected ingestion of diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate, or a dermal exposure to diphenhydramine. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The panel's recommendations for dermal or oral exposures to diphenhydramine or oral exposures to dimenhydrinate follow. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses: 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) In patients without evidence of self-harm, abuse, or malicious intent, poison center personnel should elicit additional information including the time of the ingestion or dermal exposure, determination of the precise dose ingested, and the presence of co-ingestants (Grade D). 3) Patients experiencing any changes in behavior other than mild drowsiness or mild stimulation should be referred to an emergency department. Examples of moderate to severe symptoms that warrant referral include agitation, staring spells, inconsolable crying, hallucinations, abnormal muscle movements, loss of consciousness, seizures, or respiratory depression (Grade D). 4) For patients referred to the emergency department, transportation via ambulance should be considered based on several factors including the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 5) If the patient has no symptoms, and more than 4 hours have elapsed between the time of diphenhydramine ingestion and the call to the poison center, referral to an emergency department is not recommended. For dermal exposures to diphenhydramine, if the patient has no symptoms and it has been more than 8 hours since the diphenhydramine was thoroughly removed from the skin, referral to an emergency department is not recommended (Grade D). 6) Patients with acute ingestions of less than a toxic dose of diphenhydramine, or chronic exposures to diphenhydramine and no or mild symptoms, can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop or worsen. The poison center should consider making a follow-up call at approximately 4 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 7) Children less than 6 years of age who ingest at least 7.5 mg/kg of diphenhydramine should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 8) Patients 6 years of age and older who ingest at least 7.5 mg/kg or 300 mg of diphenhydramine (whichever is less), should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 9) If the patient has no symptoms, and more than 6 hours have elapsed between the time of dimenhydrinate ingestion and the call to the poison center, referral to an emergency department is not recommended (Grade D). 10) Patients with acute ingestions of less than a toxic dose of dimenhydrinate, or chronic exposures to dimenhydrinate and no or mild symptoms, can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop or worsen. The poison center should consider making a follow-up call at approximately 6 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 11) Children less than 6 years of age ingesting at least 7.5 mg/kg of dimenhydrinate should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 12) Patients 6 years of age and older ingesting at least 7.5 mg/kg or 300 mg of dimenhydrinate (whichever is less), should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade D). 13) Following oral exposures of diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate, do not induce emesis. Because of the potential for diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate to cause loss of consciousness or seizures, activated charcoal should not be administered en route to an emergency department (Grade D). 14) For chronic dermal exposures of diphenhydramine, skin decontamination (with water or soap and water) should be attempted prior to transporting a patient to an emergency department unless moderate to severe symptoms are already present. In this circumstance, transportation should not be delayed, and EMS personnel should attempt skin decontamination en route to the emergency department (Grade D). 15) Intravenous sodium bicarbonate may be administered by EMS personnel if QRS widening (QRS >0.10 msec) is present and if authorized by EMS medical direction (Grade D). 16) Physostigmine should be reserved for administration in a hospital (Grade D). 17) Benzodiazepines may be administered by EMS personnel if agitation or seizures are present, and if authorized by EMS medical direction (Grade D).",

    "74": "Antipsychotic drugs work for patients only when given repeatedly. The overall temporal pattern of symptom improvement is not clear. Some recent data question the traditional 'delayed-onset' hypothesis and suggest that the onset of antipsychotic response may be relatively early, and the improvement may grow with repeated treatment. The present study systematically examined the time course of the antipsychotic effect and the underlying behavioral mechanisms using a conditioned avoidance response (CAR) model. Rats repeatedly treated with either typical (haloperidol) or atypical (olanzapine, risperidone) antipsychotics, but not anxiolytics (chlordiazepoxide), show an early-onset, progressive across-session decline in avoidance responding, which re-emerges when the treatment is stopped. This effect is dose-dependent, transferable between antipsychotics, and cannot be attributed to simple sedation or motor side effects. Furthermore, we found that the pattern of this drug-induced decline depends on the number of exposures to the conditioned stimulus in the presence of the drug, and is best understood as the result of drug-induced attenuation of the reinforcing effectiveness of the conditioned stimulus. We also found that repeated drug exposure can create a drug interoceptive state that allows the attenuated reinforcing property of the stimulus to be maintained over time. Together, these data provide preclinical support for the newly postulated 'early-onset' hypothesis, and suggest that the repeated antipsychotic CAR model may be useful for understanding the neurochemical and behavioral mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.",

In this review, the authors analyzed 2864 cases classified as suicide upon autopsy and toxicologic examinations between 1993 and 2002 in the Kentucky Division of Medical Examiner's Services. Blood and urine were collected in 95.0% and 72.3% of cases, respectively. A total of 32.5% of the victims had negative blood toxicologic results, and 52.7% of urine toxicology screens yielded no drugs. Analysis of the data indicated that 3 times as many women had taken antidepressants and more than twice as many had consumed opioids. Drug toxicity (\"overdose\") ranked as the third (9.9%) leading cause of suicide after firearm injury (67.5%) and hanging (13.7%). Women succumbed to drug toxicity more than men (27.5% versus 5.9%). Of the overdose deaths, 66.5% had a negative blood alcohol concentration (BAC), while antidepressants, opioids, and benzodiazepines were detected in blood in 54.4%, 37.4%, and 29.2% of the subjects, respectively. The collection of these data serves the goals of public health and clinicians in devising strategies for suicide prevention.", 
    "76": "Safety-relevant parameters are hypothesized to be important to the maintenance of pathological anxiety. The authors examined the effects of safety information and safety cues on anxious responding to a repeated 35% CO2 challenge in 31 patients with panic disorder. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) safety information, (b) safety information plus a safety cue, or (c) no safety information. In the safety information group, patients received accurate information regarding the benign effects of the CO2 challenge. In the combined group, patients also received a safety cue that is salient for many patients with panic disorder (i.e., access to an anxiolytic pill during the challenge). The experimental manipulations did not differentially affect anxious responding following an initial challenge. However, after access to the anxiolytic was removed and the challenge procedure was repeated, those in the safety information alone condition showed lower subjective anxiety compared to those in the combined safety information/safety cue group. Findings suggest that safety information facilitates extinction of anxiety but only in the absence of safety cues.",

The effects of Ola have been compared to those of the typical antipsychotic Hal, the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (Ami), and the mood stabilizer VPA. Anhedonia (assessed by reduction of sucrose preference) was induced by administration of a chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol, in which rats were exposed sequentially, over a period of 4 wk, to a variety of unpredictable mild stressors. The spatial memory was evaluated by testing the ability of the rats to discriminate a familiar vs. a novel environment, while the visual memory was assessed by testing the ability of the rats to discriminate familiar vs. novel objects. In CMS-free rats, VPA (5 or 30 mg/kg.d), Ola (0.02 or 0.1 mg/kg.d), Ami (2 mg/kg.d) and Hal (0.2 mg/kg.d) caused no detectable modifications of visual memory, whereas VPA (5 mg/kg.d), Ami (2 mg/kg.d) and Ola (0.02 mg/kg.d) did not modify spatial memory performance. In our experimental conditions, the administration of the CMS protocol caused an impairment of both visual and spatial memory. The chronic treatment of anhedonic rats with Ola (0.02 mg/kg.d) or Ami (2 mg/kg.d) prevented, at least in part, the stress-induced impairment of visuospatial performance. In conclusion, the results of the present preclinical study seem to indicate that the chronic administration of low doses of Ola or Ami has the potential to lead to substantial cognitive benefits in depressed patients.",

This diversity of presenting symptoms has led to the use of many different types of treatment approaches, none of which has proven to be successful in all women with these disorders. Non-pharmacologic options include aerobic exercise, dietary changes and supplementation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Of the pharmacologic agents used to treat premenstrual symptoms, 3 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have received a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication for treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Agents that are often used off label to treat premenstrual symptoms include spironolactone and oral contraceptives (OCs); gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and alprazolam are used less frequently in these patients. OCs have historically had little consistent data from controlled clinical trials to support their efficacy until a number of recent studies showed that an OC containing the novel progestin drospirenone is effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms in many women. A new drospirenone-containing OC formulation that is administered for 24 days in a 28-day cycle has been shown to be effective in treating PMDD.",

Most of these seizures are self-limited and patients do not require treatment. Continuous therapy after the seizure is not effective in reducing the development of afebrile seizures. Antipyretics are effective in reducing the risk of febrile seizures if given early in the illness. Immediate care for the patient who has had a febrile seizure includes stopping the seizure, if prolonged, and evaluating the patient for the cause of the fever. Bacterial infections are treatable sources of fever but are not usually the cause of the fever that triggers a seizure. The patient must be assessed for these treatable sources. Long-term consequences of febrile seizure are rare in children who are otherwise healthy. Current recommendations do not support the use of continuing or intermittent neuroleptic or benzodiazepine suppressive therapies after a simple febrile seizure.", 
    "84": "A drug interaction refers to an event in which the usual pharmacological effect of a drug is modified by other factors, most frequently additional drugs. When two drugs are administered simultaneously, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can occur that may increase or decrease the intended magnitude or duration of the effect of one or both drugs. Drugs may interact on a pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic basis. Pharmacodynamic interactions arise when the alteration of the effects occurs at the site of action. This is a wide field where not only interactions between different drugs are considered but also drug and metabolites (midazolam/alpha-hydroxy-midazolam), enantiomers (ketamine), as well as phenomena such as tolerance (nordiazepam) and sensitization (diazepam). Pharmacodynamic interactions can result in antagonism or synergism and can originate at a receptor level (antagonism, partial agonism, down-regulation, up-regulation), at an intraneuronal level (transduction, uptake), or at an interneuronal level (physiological pathways). Alternatively, psychotropic drug interactions assessed through quantitative pharmaco-EEG can be viewed according to the broad underlying objective of the study: safety-oriented (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), strictly pharmacologically-oriented (benzodiazepine receptors), or broadly neuro-physiologically-oriented (diazepam/buspirone). Methodological issues are stressed, particularly drug plasma concentrations, dose-response relationships and time-course of effects (fluoxetine/buspirone), and unsolved questions are addressed (yohimbine/caffeine, hydroxizyne/alcohol).",

    "91": "This paper reviews the use of sleep-promoting medications in nursing home residents with reference to risks versus benefits. Up to two-thirds of elderly people living in institutions experience sleep disturbance. The aetiology of sleep disturbance includes poor sleep hygiene, medical and psychiatric disorders, sleep apnoea, periodic limb movements and restless leg syndrome. One key factor in the development of sleep disturbance in the nursing home is the environment, particularly with respect to high levels of night-time noise and light, low levels of daytime light, and care routines that do not promote sleep. Clinical assessment should include a comprehensive medical, psychiatric and sleep history including a review of prescribed medications. Nonpharmacological interventions for insomnia are underutilised in many clinical settings despite evidence that they are often highly effective. International studies suggest that 50-80% of nursing home residents have at least one prescription for psychotropic medication. Utilisation rates vary dramatically from country to country and from institution to institution. The most commonly prescribed medications for sleep are benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs). The vast majority of studies of these medications are short-term, i.e. < or =2 weeks, although some longer extension trials have recently been carried out. Clinicians are advised to avoid long-acting benzodiazepines and to use hypnotics for as brief a period as possible, in most cases not exceeding 2-3 weeks of treatment. Patients receiving benzodiazepines are at increased risk of daytime sedation, falls, and cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone and eszopiclone may have some advantages over the benzodiazepines, particularly with respect to the development of tolerance and dependence. Ramelteon, a novel agent with high selectivity for melatonin receptors, has recently been approved in the US. Use of the antidepressant trazodone for sleep in nondepressed patients is somewhat controversial. Atypical antipsychotics should not be used to treat insomnia unless there is also evidence of severe behavioural symptoms or psychosis.",

In addition, in the hole-board test, nose-poking was also significantly decreased ( P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent fashion [ED (50) (CL (50)) = 9.07 (4.51 - 18.26) mg/kg]. Moreover, palmitone at any dose caused no change in motor activity nor disruption in traction performance. In contrast, diazepam, used as reference drug, produced an anxiolytic effect with a significant and dose-dependent decrease in motor coordination accompanied by disruption of the traction performance. Behavioral studies suggest an anti-anxiety effect produced by palmitone, but its neuropharmacological profile differs from that observed for benzodiazepines such as diazepam.", 
    "93": "This report was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine treatment as an adjunct therapy to mood stabilizers in the treatment of four adolescents responding insufficiently to mood stabilizers. All patients were diagnosed with bipolar I disorder according to DSM IV criteria. YMRS (Young mania rating scale) and CGI (Clinical global impression, improvement and therapeutic effectiveness scales) were used to evaluate overall response of the episode to the drugs. All patients with no adequate response to mood stabilizers did respond to adjunctive olanzapine treatment (10-30 mg/per day). It has been suggested that antipsychotics may be useful as an adjunct to mood stabilisers in bipolar disorder. However, further research is warranted regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents.", 
    "94": "Over two thirds of people suffering from depression complain of pain with or without reporting psychological symptoms. Physical symptoms are more prevalent among the women, the elderly, the poor, and in children population. Successful treatment of depression in children complicated by pain symptoms constitutes a great clinical challenge. Duloxetine has already emerged as a safe and effective treatment option for adult depressed patients with painful physical symptoms. However, no data exist in literature which suggests use of duloxetine in childhood and adolescent population for the same clinical indication. We report a case documenting successful use of duloxetine in a depressed girl child who also had severe pain and dissociative symptoms.", 
    "95": "Upper airway obstruction (UAO) during sedation can often cause clinically significant adverse events. Direct comparison of different drugs' propensities for UAO may improve selection of appropriate sedating agents. The authors used the application of negative airway pressure to determine the pressure that causes UAO in healthy subjects sedated with midazolam or propofol infusions.", 
    "96": "Twenty subjects (12 male and 8 female) completed the study. After achieving equivalent levels of sedation, the subjects' ventilation, end-tidal gases, respiratory inductance plethysmographic signals, and Bispectral Index values were monitored for 5 min. Negative airway pressure was then applied via a facemask in steps of 3 cm H(2)O from -3 to -18 cm H(2)O. UAO was assessed by cessation of inspiratory airflow and asynchrony between abdomen and chest respiratory inductance plethysmographic signals.", 
    "97": "Equivalent levels of sedation were achieved with both drugs with average (+/- SD) Bispectral Index levels of 75 +/- 5. Resting ventilation was mildly reduced without any changes in end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide. There was no difference between the drugs in the negative pressure resulting in UAO. Five female subjects and one male subject with midazolam and four female subjects and one male subject with propofol did not show any UAO even at -18 cm H(2)O. Compared with males, female subjects required more negative pressures to cause UAO with midazolam (P = 0.02) but not with propofol (P = 0.1).", 
    "98": "At the mild to moderate level of sedation studied, midazolam and propofol sedation resulted in the same propensity for UAO. In this homogeneous group of healthy subjects, there was a considerable range of negative pressures required to cause UAO. The specific factors responsible for the maintenance of the upper airway during sedation remain to be elucidated.",

We also present the implications of general anesthesia in patients with SPS. The use of regional anesthetic techniques in patients with SPS has the advantage of avoiding exposure to muscle relaxants. The use of general anesthesia in patients with SPS carries the risk of postoperative hypotonia due to enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid action on synaptic transmission by drugs that have a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonistic action.",

The dose range for each treatment group was 5 to 40 mg/day (M=16.6 mg/day, SD=7.4) for olanzapine; 1 to 8 mg/day (M=3.9 mg/day, SD=1.6) for risperidone; and 50 to 900 mg/day (M=376.8 mg/day, SD=213.4) for quetiapine. Antipsychotic group designation was based on medication treatment at study entry (i.e., non-random assignment). Participant characteristics were collected to test for treatment group differences and for potential associations with severity of sexual dysfunction. The primary data analysis was a mixed linear model analysis of covariance with age, gender, and presence/absence of antidepressant known to cause sexual dysfunction included as covariates.", 
    "109": "There was a significant treatment effect on severity of sexual dysfunction, as measured by ASEX total scores (p=.04). The adjusted average ASEX total scores were lower in the quetiapine (M=17.80) than in the risperidone (M=19.69) or olanzapine (M=20.34) groups. Individual comparisons of the treatments on adjusted average ASEX total scores indicated a significant difference between olanzapine and quetiapine (p=.04), but no difference between risperidone and quetiapine (p=.17) or olanzapine and risperidone (p=.76).", 
    "110": "Quetiapine was associated with less severe sexual dysfunction than olanzapine and risperidone (albeit the effect between risperidone and quetiapine was not statistically significant). Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with a comparable degree of sexual dysfunction. Patients in all three treatment groups, nonetheless, experienced a moderately high degree of sexual dysfunction. Because the patients were not randomized, conclusions must be interpreted within the context of the quasi-experimental design.",

Wistar rats were treated with normal saline vehicle (controls), haloperidol (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg/day), risperidone (3, 5 and 6 mg/kg/day) and olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days via osmotic minipumps. Striatal and cerebellar tissue were collected and in vivo dopamine D2-receptor occupancies were determined using 3H-raclopride. The doses required to achieve dopamine D2-receptor occupancy of 80% in 11- and 24-week old rats were: haloperidol 0.25 mg/kg/day, risperidone 5 mg/kg/day and olanzapine 10 mg/kg/day.", 
    "112": "Modulation of the acoustic startle response by aversive sensory stimulation is a simple and objective indicator of emotionality in rodents and human beings that has been extremely valuable for the analysis of neural systems associated with fear and anxiety. We have described a paradigm for measuring fear-potentiated, whole-body acoustic startle in nonhuman primates and have developed a protocol for maintaining fear-potentiated startle over repeated sessions with minimal extinction to allow measurement of pharmacological effects on fear-potentiated startle by using within-subjects designs in relatively small groups of monkeys.", 
    "113": "A novel, within-subjects testing protocol was used to examine the effects of three compounds in rhesus monkeys that have anxiolytic effects in rodents on fear-potentiated startle but that differ in their mechanism of action. Spontaneous vocalizations during testing also were recorded. Juvenile monkeys that were trained to associate a visual stimulus with a fear-inducing air blast to the face were tested after acute administration of different doses of buspirone diazepam, morphine, or vehicle.", 
    "114": "Monkeys rapidly developed a robust and persistent elevation of startle response in the presence of the CS during repeated testing sessions. Diazepam and morphine produced dose-related reductions of fear-potentiated startle. Buspirone did not significantly reduce fear-potentiated startle at the doses tested, although a trend was evident at the highest dose. All drugs reduced rates of coo vocalizations during startle testing.", 
    "115": "These fear-potentiated startle results suggest that rhesus monkeys have a pharmacological profile with respect to these compounds that is closer to humans than to rats. This demonstrates the value of examining the effects of drugs on fear-potentiated startle in nonhuman primates.",

SJG-136 binds in the minor groove of DNA and produces G-G interstrand cross-links via reactive N(10)-C(11)/N(10')-C(ll') imine/carbinolamine moieties. We have developed a sensitive, specific liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for the quantitative determination of SJG-136 in plasma. SJG-136 was isolated by solid phase extraction through a C8 column, reverse-phase HPLC separation was accomplished on a C18 column with isocratic elution and MS/MS detection, monitoring the m/z 557-m/z 476 transition after electrospray ionization. The linear range and lower limit of quantitation from plasma standard curves were 2.8-1800 nM, and 5 nM, respectively. SJG-136 plasma protein binding was species-dependent. Values of the unbound fraction in human, rat and mouse were 25%, 16.2% and <1%, respectively. Protein binding was saturable in dog plasma where the unbound fraction increased from 10.8% to 22.3% over a 22-720 nM concentration range. SJG-136 pharmacokinetics after a single intravenous dose were best fit to a two-compartment open model with elimination half-life and plasma clearance values of 97 min and 6.1 mL/min/kg, respectively. SJG-136 did not accumulate in plasma following intravenous administration of 1.0 microg/kg doses for five consecutive days.", 
    "117": "The main therapy for the symptomatic management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is pharmacotherapy, although comprehensive management methods also include psychotherapeutic interventions. Traditionally, treatments including anxiolytics and antidepressants have been used in GAD management, but prescribing physicians have more recently moved towards using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Indeed, newer medicines have been shown to be as effective as older treatments, but with improved safety and tolerability. Although the best way to treat GAD has yet to be established, these patients clearly need long-term supervision. Ideally, physicians should prescribe treatment with the purpose of ultimately eliminating symptoms and re-establishing normal function. To achieve this goal, physicians need a more effective, faster acting, safer, and better tolerated drug than the many existing GAD treatments.",

    "120": "Only 10% of gynaecologists and 19.4% of GPs had never prescribed HRT. The reasons given for not prescribing HRT were adverse effects and the fear of cancer among GPs and adverse effects and social alarm in the GY group. Phytoestrogens were the most commonly used alternative; however, GPs were more willing to use antidepressants and benzodiazepines than GYs. The frequency of HRT prescription in symptomatic women was significantly higher among GYs. The main reasons for prescribing HRT were climacteric complaints and improvement in life quality for GYs and, climacteric complaints and the prevention of osteoporosis for GPs. Seventy-eight percent of GYs prescribing hormones referred a high degree of satisfaction with HRT, whereas only 50% of GPs expressed a similar attitude.", 
    "121": "Concern for HRT prescription in Spain is high. Adverse effects and the fear of cancer are negative conditioning factors in the prescription of HRT, whereas climacteric complaints, quality of life and the prevention of osteoporosis are positive conditioning factors. GYs are more willing to use HRT than GPs. This contrast may reflect the indecision of GPs regarding the preventive value of HRT.", 
    "122": "A flow based hollow-fiber in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was established. The immortalised porcine brain microvascular endothelial cell line PBMEC/C1-2 was cultured in a pulsatile hollow-fiber cartridge system (Cellmax Quad). The usability of PBMEC/C1-2 in the flow based hollow-fiber model was increased from three days in the originally used Transwell model up to four months due to the application of shear stress and co-culturing with glioma cell line C6. It was shown that the tightness of PBMEC/C1-2 layers was enhanced significantly in astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) and in co-culture. The morphology of PBMEC/C1-2 and C6 was visualised by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Permeation studies were accomplished with a set of benzodiazepines. The raw data were processed with three different calculation models and the results were compared with permeability coefficients obtained with an established Transwell model. In summary a flow based hollow-fiber BBB in vitro model was developed, which can be used to perform experiments with physiological (e.g., regulation of BBB permeability), pharmacological (e.g., pharmacokinetics and dynamics) and pathophysiological (e.g., effects of diseases on BBB permeability and vice versa) objectives.",

Each treatment group received both an injection and a tablet to reduce treatment group variability. Patients were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) before receiving medication and at 30 and 90 minutes after medication was administered. The intergroup mean percent reductions in rating scale scores were compared using ANOVA, chi-square, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.",

    "128": "Benzodiazepine site inverse agonists may increase or decrease locomotor activity in rodents, depending on the experimental settings. We have compared the behavioral responses to environmental novelty of rats treated with the non-selective inverse agonist DMCM (2 mg/kg) and the alpha1-subunit affinity-selective inverse agonist 3-EBC (15 mg/kg). The behavior in spontaneous locomotor assay (during 45 min) and elevated plus maze (EPM) was automatically recorded. In the EPM, general activity-related parameters were similarly decreased, whereas only DMCM inhibited open-arm activity. In the locomotor assay, both compounds depressed locomotion in the first 15 min and activity in the central zone of the chamber. However, the influence of 3-EBC was less pronounced. The alpha1-subunit selective antagonist beta-CCt (15 mg/kg) attenuated locomotor depression, but not the central-zone avoidance elicited by DMCM. When habituated to the chamber, DMCM-treated animals emitted a plateau phase of activity, which disappeared by adding beta-CCt. Hence, inhibition of activity in exposed areas may be mediated by non-alpha1-subunits, whereas both alpha1 and non-alpha1-subunits may participate in suppression of activity in more protective areas of an apparatus. Hyperlocomotion in habituated animals may depend primarily on the alpha1-subunit. Moreover, the bimodal influence of inverse agonists on locomotion can be biphasic, observable in the same experiment.",

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed transient areas of high intensity in the gray and subcortical white matter of the left occipital and temporal lobes. The lesions did not reflect the vascular territories. After a period of over 2 weeks, his consciousness level improved associated with reduced intensity of the abnormal areas. These findings suggest that seizure induced reversible cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Transient diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities may be associated with generalized seizures and the intensity may reflect the clinical condition.",

Pupil diameter was measured with infrared pupillometry under four luminance levels. Alertness was assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS) and by critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF). Blood pressure, heart rate and skin conductance were recorded by conventional methods. Data were analysed with analysis of variance (anova) with multiple comparisons.",

However, since the frontal cortex is one of the most important regions for antipsychotic actions, this study attempted to classify antipsychotic drugs based on gene expression in the frontal cortex. Chlorpromazine and thioridazine were selected as typical antipsychotics, and olanzapine and quetiapine as atypical antipsychotics. Since these drugs have similar chemical structures, the effect of the basic structure on gene expression can be eliminated. Cluster analysis of microarray experiments separated 4-drug-administered mice into chlorpromazine-quetiapine and thioridazine-olanzapine groups. This classification scheme is different from that which is based on criteria currently used to group the typical and atypical drugs and suggests that antipsychotic drugs can be further separated into multiple groups.",

    "142": "The variability within Aspergillus fumigatus Fresenius and related species was examined using macro-, micro-morphology, growth temperature regimes and extrolite patterns. In addition, DNA analyses including partial beta-tubulin, calmodulin and actin gene sequences were used. Detailed examination of strains, considered as A. fumigatus earlier, showed that they could be divided into four groups including A. fumigatus sensu stricto, A. lentulus and two new species. The intraspecific genetic variability within A. fumigatus sensu stricto was low, the sequence differences among 23 strains of the species was at most two bases in each partial beta-tubulin and calmodulin gene. However, intraspecific morphological diversity within the species was high and delineation of the species was equivocal. Therefore, beta-tubulin and calmodulin gene sequences could be critical determinants for the delineation of the A. fumigatus sensu stricto species. A. lentulus including isolates from clinical origin, Korean soil and from a dolphin clustered into an isolated group based on beta-tubulin, calmodulin and actin gene sequences, differing from A. fumigatus by morphological characters, growth temperature and extrolite profile. A. lentulus produces the extrolites auranthine, cyclopiazonic acid, a dimeric indole of unknown structure, neosartorin, some pyripyropens, terrein and some tryptoquivalins and tryptoquivalons. Two pair of isolates (CBS 117194, 117186 and 117520, 117519) clustered into separate groups from A. fumigatus and the other Aspergillus section Fumigati species, including the teleomorph Neosartorya, are proposed as two new species. A. fumigatiaffinis spec. nov. produces the extrolites auranthine, cycloechinulin, helvolic acid, neosartorin, palitantin, pyripyropens, tryptoquivalins and tryptoquivalons, and A. novofumigatus spec. nov. produces the extrolites cycloechinuline, helvolic acid, neosartorin, palitantin and terrein.",

A detailed analysis of WEB-2086 anticancer activity was then performed focusing on breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. WEB-2086-treated cells, either expressing (MCF-7) or unexpressing (MDA-MB-231) the oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha, underwent a dose-dependent growth arrest (IC(50)=0.65+/-0.09 and 0.41+/-0.07 mM, respectively) and accumulation in G(0)-G(1) phase. WEB-2086 also induced morphological and functional changes typical of mature mammary phenotype including (i) cell enlargement and massive neutral lipid deposition (best accomplished in MCF-7 cells); (ii) decrease in motility and active cathepsin D levels (mainly observed in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells). The expression of ERalpha was neither increased nor reactivated in treated MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. WEB-2086-induced differentiation in breast cancer cells involved the upregulation of PTEN, a key tumour suppressor protein opposing tumorigenesis, and was apparently independent of p53, PAFR, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and ERalpha status. Overall, WEB-2086 can be proposed as an effective antiproliferative and differentiative agent with interesting translational opportunities to treat breast cancers in support to conventional chemotherapy.",

Catatonic agitation relapsed when topiramate was withdrawn but remitted again when topiramate and lorazepam therapy was restored. In two cases, continued topiramate therapy was accompanied by sustained remission. These case reports present a novel approach to the treatment of catatonia.",

The main outcome measure was number of ADRs per patient as determined by blinded geriatrician and geropharmacist pairs using Naranjo's ADR algorithm. For all ADRs (possible, probable, or definite), preventability was assessed. Discordances were resolved by consensus conferences.", 
    "153": "Overall, 33% of patients had one or more ADRs for a rate of 1.92 per 1000 person-days of follow-up. The rate for preventable ADRs was 0.71 per 1000 person-days of follow-up. Independent risk factors for all ADRs were number of medications (adjusted [Adj.] hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.10 per medication), use of warfarin (Adj. HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.22-1.87), and (marginally) the use of benzodiazepines (Adj. HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.95-1.58). Counterintuitively, use of sedatives and/or hypnotics was inversely related to ADR risk (Adj. HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.57).

The lorazepam dosage was tapered in a uniform fashion over 6 days by decreasing the total daily dose by 50% every other day on 3 occasions; it was then discontinued. The occurrence of withdrawal from lorazepam was determined by pediatric intensive care unit attending physicians based on clinical judgment. Patients were assessed for withdrawal twice daily beginning 48 hours after the initiation of the lorazepam taper. Assessments were continued for 72 hours after lorazepam discontinuation or until the patient experienced withdrawal, whichever came first. Patient demographic, sedative dosing, and lorazepam serum concentration data were collected to identify risk factors for withdrawal.",

    "160": "The effect of pentobarbital, a sedative-hypnotic barbiturate, on the in vivo binding of benzodiazepine receptors in the mouse brain was investigated. Dose-related changes in the apparent binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 ([3H]flumazenil) in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and pons-medulla were observed by pretreatment with pentobarbital. For quantification of the kinetic properties of the in vivo binding of [3H]Ro15-1788, time courses of radioactivity following its injection were examined, and kinetic analysis was performed using the compartment model. The time courses of radioactivity following injection of [3H]Ro15-1788 with 3 mg/kg Ro15-1788 were used as input function. In all regions studied, rate constants between input compartment and specific binding compartment were significantly decreased by pentobarbital. However, no significant alterations in the binding potential (BP=K3/K4) of benzodiazepine receptors by pentobarbital were observed in any of the regions. A saturation experiment indicated that the decrease in the input rate constant (K3), which includes both the association rate constant (k(on)) and the number of binding sites available (B(max)), was mainly due to decrease in k(on). These results suggest that apparent increases in binding at 20 min after tracer injection were due to the decrease in the association and dissociation rates of binding in vivo.", 
    "161": "The aim of this study is to identify the class of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of amino acid and dipeptide prodrugs of acyclovir (ACV) and to modulate transport and metabolism of amino acid and dipeptide prodrugs of acyclovir by enzyme inhibitors across rabbit cornea. l-Valine ester of acyclovir, valacyclovir (VACV) and l-glycine-valine ester of acyclovir, gly-val-acyclovir (GVACV) were used as model compounds. Hydrolysis studies of VACV and GVACV in corneal homogenate were conducted in presence of various enzyme inhibitors. IC(50) values were determined for the enzyme inhibitors. Transport studies were conducted with isolated rabbit corneas at 34 degrees C. Complete inhibition of VACV hydrolysis was observed in the presence of Pefabloc SC (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride) and PCMB (p-chloromercuribenzoic acid). Similar trend was also observed with GVACV in the presence of bestatin. IC(50) values of PCMB and bestatin for VACV and GVACV were found to be 3.81+/-0.94 and 0.34+/-0.08muM respectively. Eserine, tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) also produced significant inhibition of VACV hydrolysis. Transport of VACV and GVACV across cornea showed decreased metabolic rate and modulation of transport in presence of PCMB and bestain respectively. The principle enzyme classes responsible for the hydrolysis of VACV and GVACV were carboxylesterases and aminopeptidases respectively. Enzyme inhibitors modulated the transport and metabolism of prodrugs simultaneously even though their affinity towards prodrugs was distinct. In conclusion, utility of enzyme inhibitors to modulate transport and metabolism of prodrugs appears to be promising strategy for enhancing drug transport across cornea.", 
    "162": "Buprenorphine, a partial mu-receptor agonist widely substituted for heroin in the treatment of addiction, is often misused in combination with benzodiazepines. Improved hedonic properties may result, but only at the cost of increased buprenorphine toxicity. In order to elucidate the appeal of the benzodiazepine-buprenorphine combination, the present study looked at its neuropsycho-pharmacological effects on various emotional and cognitive parameters in the mouse. On the basis of previous dose-response studies, the regimen used was buprenorphine 0.3mg/kg, s.c. plus dipotassium clorazepate 1, 4 and 16 mg/kg, i.p. Anxiety-like behaviour was assessed using the black and white test box, and memory processes were examined via the spontaneous alternation paradigm in the Y-maze, and passive avoidance tests. Spontaneous locomotor activity was also evaluated. High doses of clorazepate impaired buprenorphine-induced hyperactivity and anxiogenic-like effects. They also increased buprenorphine-induced spontaneous alternation impairment, but did not modify its impact on long-term memory processes. These results suggest that the positive reinforcement experienced with the buprenorphine-benzodiazepine combination may be attributable, at least in part, to an increase in buprenorphine's sedative effect associated with a decrease in anxiogenicity.", 
    "163": "A 74-year-old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation. Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam. On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors. The patient had a fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms. Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase (2218 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg/ml) levels. The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels were normalized (175 IU/L). This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment. The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case. The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected. Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion. Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression.",

Plasma concentrations of midazolam and gefitinib were measured. In study 2, 73 healthy volunteers with previously defined single-dose gefitinib pharmacokinetic profiles were genotyped for CYP3A5. In study 3 a single oral dose of gefitinib (250 mg) was administered to poor and extensive CYP2D6 metabolisers (n = 15 in each group). Plasma concentrations of gefitinib and its major metabolite, M523595, were measured. Plasma concentrations of gefitinib, M523595 and midazolam were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection, and appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by non-compartmental methods. Genetic analysis of CYP3A5 (study 2) and CYP2D6 (study 3) alleles was carried out using standard methodology.",

In study 2 eight of 73 volunteers (11%) were identified as CYP3A5 expressers. No apparent relationship was observed between the occurrence of the CYP3A5 expresser genotype and gefitinib plasma clearance or terminal elimination halflife. In study 3 M523595 was not detected in any plasma samples collected from poor CYP2D6 metabolisers. Gefitinib geometric mean AUCinfinity and peak plasma drug concentration were higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolisers compared with extensive metabolisers (AUCinfinity 3060 vs 1430 ng . h/mL, p < 0.05, ANOVA), although the range of values was wide with considerable overlap between the groups. Gefitinib was well tolerated in both groups.", 
    "171": "Individual differences in CYP3A expression do not explain all the interindividual variability in gefitinib exposure. There is no apparent relationship between CYP3A5 genotype and gefitinib clearance. The lack of measurable levels of M523595 in poor CYP2D6 metabolisers confirms that production of this metabolite is mediated by CYP2D6. Although higher exposure to gefitinib occurs in individuals who are poor CYP2D6 metabolisers, genotyping prior to initiation of therapy and dosage adjustment are not warranted.",

A degradation product that appeared in alprazolam tablets during their stability assay, 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinolin-4-amine, also named triazolaminoquinoline, was tested as possible candidate in the HPLC method employed for the study. The impurity showed the same retention time and spectra as the degradation product; but as all these compounds are very closely related, a confirmation with an independent technique was necessary, and CE was chosen for that purpose. Problems related to the adsorption of the analytes to the negatively charged silica surface were solved by employing a new polymeric capillary coating consisting of poly(3-aminopropylmethylsiloxane). The polymer provided EOF towards the anode, and the two compounds were separated in less than 8 min in a 60 cm total-length capillary, 75 microm id capillary with a BGE containing 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 2.0 with 20% ACN. When the sample containing the degradation product was injected, the presence of triazolaminoquinoline was confirmed.",

Changes in oxyhemoglobin (Delta cO2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (Delta cHHb) were assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry. Changes in cHbD (= Delta cO(2)Hb - Delta cHHb) reflect changes in cerebral blood oxygenation and changes in concentration of total hemoglobin (Delta ctHb = Delta cO2Hb + Delta cHHb) represent changes in cerebral blood volume (DeltaCBV). Changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (DeltaCBFV) were intermittently measured using Doppler ultrasound. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), arterial oxygen saturation (saO2) and transcutaneous measured pO2 (tcpO2) and pCO2 (tcpCO2) were continuously registered.

The complete separation of enantiomers of all racemates investigated was successfully achieved under at least one of CSP/eluent combinations employed. Pure alcohols such ethanol or 2-propanol, with a fixed percentage of DEA added, serve as valuable alternatives to the more common n-hexane-based normal-phase eluents in resolution of Mianserin on the AD CSP. In order to study the chiroptical properties of aptazepine derivatives, chromatographic resolutions are carried out at semipreparative scale using Chiralpak AD and Chiralpak IA as CSPs. Nonconventional dichloromethane-based eluents have permitted to expand the chiral resolving ability of the immobilized Chiralpak IA CSP and to perform mg-scale enantioseparations with an analytical-size column. Assignment of the absolute configuration of the separated enantiomers is empirically established by comparing their chiroptical data with those of structurally related Mianserin.",

    "208": "The results of this study show that both the benzodiazepine CDP and the barbiturate sodium pentobarbital increased food intake in a manner similar to increasing the palatability of the ingestant, and picrotoxin decreased food intake in a manner similar to decreasing the palatability of the ingestant.", 
    "209": "These results suggest that the food intake enhancement properties of benzodiazepines are mediated through a mechanism affecting perceived palatability.", 
    "210": "The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for falling and fall-related injury among a group of inpatients undergoing rehabilitation after major lower limb amputation.", 
    "211": "Retrospective cohort.", 
    "212": "Out of 1267 patients, 260 (20.5%) fell at least once. There were a total of 374 falls, 67 (17.9%) of which resulted in one or more injuries. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for factors significantly associated with falling, including age of > or =71 yrs (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.02-1.89), lengths of stay of 22-35 days (OR = 2.97, 95% CI = 1.14-7.72) or >5 wks (OR = 6.07, 95% CI = 2.34-15.71), four or more comorbidities (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.09-3.41), cognitive impairment (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.02-2.78), two or more as-needed medications (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.02-3.21), benzodiazepines (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.24-3.96), and opiates (OR = 5.76, 95% CI = 3.29-10.09). Factors significantly associated with fall-related injuries included bilateral amputation (OR = 3.68, 95% CI = 1.49-9.05) and falls during the day shift (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.24-5.57).", 
    "213": "One in five patients with lower limb amputation will likely experience at least one fall during inpatient rehabilitation, with 18% sustaining an injury. Ongoing research is required to develop appropriate intervention strategies to ameliorate the risk of falling during inpatient rehabilitation."
