    "0": "The discriminative stimulus (DS) effects of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) were evaluated in 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats that were trained to discriminate 4-AP from saline in a standard two-lever food reinforced drug discrimination procedure. 4-AP along with its structural analogs 3-aminopyridine (3-AP), 2-aminopyridine (2-AP), and 2,3-diaminopyridine (2,3-DIAP) produced dose-dependent increases in the percentage of responses on the 4-AP-associated lever with full substitution at one or more doses. 2,6-Diaminopyridine (2, 6-DIAP) and 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DIAP) produced dose-dependent increases in the percentage of responses on the 4-AP-associated lever but only partially substituted for 4-AP. Neither 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4-DMAP) nor pyridine substituted for 4-AP. Substitution studies were also conducted with indirect dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine agonists, and gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) agonists and antagonists. The norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor tomoxetine, but not nisoxetine or imipramine, produced dose-dependent increases in the percentage of responses on the 4-AP-associated lever and partially substituted for 4-AP. In addition, antagonism studies were conducted using indirect dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine antagonists, and GABA(A) agonists as pretreatments to the training dose of 4-AP. The benzodiazepine agonists chlordiazepoxide and diazepam dose dependently attenuated the DS effects of 4-AP. The present results demonstrate that the K-channel blocker 4-AP can be trained as a DS in rats and the DS effects of 4-AP are likely mediated through blockade of voltage-dependent K-channels. The results also demonstrate a novel interaction between benzodiazepines and K-channels.", 
    "1": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a novel neuroactive steroid, Co 2-6749 (GMA-839; WAY-141839; 3alpha, 21-dihydroxy-3beta-trifluoromethyl-19-nor-5beta-pregnan-20-one), on gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors in vitro and to define its anxiolytic-like effects and side effect profile in vivo. Co 2-6749 fully inhibited [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in rat brain cortical membranes with an IC(50) value of 230 nM and in human gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor subunit combinations of alpha1beta2gamma2L, alpha2beta2gamma2L, alpha3beta2gamma2L, alpha4beta3gamma2L, alpha5beta2gamma2L, and alpha6beta3gamma2L receptors (IC(50) values of 200, 200, 96, 2300, 210, and 2000 nM). Rats were trained in a Geller-Seifter operant conflict paradigm. Co 2-6749 caused a dose-related increase in punished responding with a minimum effective dose of 1.6 mg/kg, p.o., a wide therapeutic index relative to a decrease in unpunished responding and relative to ataxia, and no tolerance. Additionally, ethanol caused less than a 2-fold shift to the left in the dose-response function of Co 2-6749 in the rotorod procedure in rats. In a pigeon conflict paradigm, punished responding was maximally increased to 784% of vehicle control by 30 mg/kg, p.o., with a 2-h duration and no effect on unpunished responding at this dose. Similarly, punished responding in squirrel monkeys was maximally increased to 1774% of control by 10 mg/kg, p.o., with no effect on unpunished responding at this dose. With robust anxiolytic-like activity across species, a large separation between anxiolytic-like effects and sedation/ataxia, a minimal interaction with ethanol, a lack of tolerance, and apparent oral bioavailability, Co 2-6749 makes an ideal candidate for development as a novel anxiolytic drug.", 
    "2": "Chlormethiazole positively modulates the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor complex and is primarily used to treat certain life-threatening neurological events (e.g., refractory seizures and ethanol withdrawal syndrome). On account of several experimental and clinical studies reporting effectiveness against the toxic effects of heroin and methamphetamine, chlormethiazole was systematically tested in the present study for its effectiveness against cocaine-induced seizures and lethality in mice. The protective effects of chlormethiazole were evaluated against single, submaximal convulsive (75 mg/kg) or lethal (110 mg/kg) doses of cocaine. Chlormethiazole also was tested against the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of cocaine-kindled seizures, and against fully developed kindled seizures. Cocaine-kindled seizures were produced by a total of five daily treatments with 60 mg/kg cocaine. The inverted-screen test was used to assess behavioral side effects of chlormethiazole. Chlormethiazole protected against acute cocaine-induced convulsions (ED(50) = 7.0 mg/kg) and lethality (ED(50)= 21.8 mg/kg) with a robust separation [protective index (PI) = TD(50)/ED(50) = 22.3 and 7.2, respectively] from doses producing behavioral side effects (TD(50) = 156 mg/kg). Chlormethiazole suppressed the behavioral expression of cocaine-kindled seizures and prevented the development of sensitization to the convulsant effects of cocaine. It was also effective in suppressing fully developed kindled seizures. Relative to cocaine seizures in naive mice, chlormethiazole was equieffective, less potent (ED(50) = 22.3 mg/kg), and had a reduced protective index (PI = 3.7) against cocaine-induced seizures in kindled mice. The protective profile and protective index of chlormethiazole were superior to those of the benzodiazepines clonazepam and diazepam, which were of limited efficacy and had low protective indices (PI = approximately 1). The results of this study predict the potential utility of chlormethiazole for the treatment of life-threatening complications of cocaine abuse for which no specific treatment has yet been identified.", 
    "3": "1. Experiments were done to determine the influence of gender and the oestrous cycle on rat urinary bladder contractility in response to cholinergic stimulation. 2. Bladder strips from female rats responded to high frequency stimulation with smaller contractile responses than did strips from males, and to low concentrations of carbachol with greater responses. The decreased responsiveness of bladder strips from female rats to electrical field stimulation can be primarily attributed to the rats in the oestrous stage of the oestrous cycle. 3. Bladder strips from female rats in all stages of the oestrous cycle were more sensitive to carbachol than those from males, but there were no differences in sensitivity to electrical field stimulation. 4. The contractile responses of strips from both male and female rats to carbachol were antagonized by muscarinic antagonists with the following rank order of affinity (pA(2)) estimates: 4-DAMP>pirenzepine>methoctramine, suggesting that the receptor mediating contraction was the M3 subtype. There were no differences in pA(2) values between bladder strips from male and female rats. 5. The data indicate that responsiveness of bladder strips to electrical field stimulation and carbachol is altered in female rats in the oestrous stage of the oestrous cycle. Furthermore, gender influences the sensitivity of rat bladder to muscarinic stimulation.",

However, in a recent 5-month period one medical examiner's office found two such cases that are reported in this paper. One is a suicide and the other is not. The toxicologic and anatomic findings for each are described. Blood olanzapine concentrations ranged from 0.237 microg/ml for one to 0.675 microg/ml for the other. Gastric content concentrations also exhibited a wide range, varying from 0.197 microg/ml to 17.400 microg/ml for the other. Distribution studies of the liver, kidney, and brain produced nondetectable concentrations for the drug. There were no consistent pathologic anatomic findings for cause of death except for moderate coronary atherosclerosis in the nonsuicide case. Both deaths were attributed to olanzapine toxicity.",

Clinical variables, patient cooperation, time to recovery, and amnesia served as outcome variables.", 
    "7": "There was no significant difference between the two study groups in patient characteristics. The \"target SEF\" was 13.6 +/- 0.7 Hz for the propofol group and 14.8 +/- 1.1 Hz for the midazolam group (n.s.). The only clinical parameter with a significant difference between the groups was the percent of time in which the heart rate deviated more than 20% from baseline for at least 2 minutes, i.e. 14.6 +/- 2.0 % for propofol and 48.2 +/- 38.0% for midazolam (P<0.01). Patient cooperation was better in the propofol group than in the midazolam group (full cooperation, 13/15 vs. 1/17, respectively; P<0.001). Patient recovery was significantly quicker in the propofol group (P<0.001). The degree of amnesia was similar in both groups; no patient in either group remembered details of the procedure.",

    "9": "To examine the effect of the anti-stress agent diazepam on the immune response, rats were exposed either to acute swim stress, i.e., swimming once only for 30 minutes (non-trained swimmers), or to chronic stress with gradual progressive training for 6 weeks (trained swimmers). Both groups of animals were divided into subgroups treated before swimming with and without diazepam, 1 mg/kg, administered i.m. The phagocytic capacity and superoxide anion generation of the peritoneal macrophages was examined. In addition, the proliferative response of the splenic cells (splenocytes) to concanavalin A (Con A) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), as well as the serum corticosterone levels were investigated. Diazepam abolished increased superoxide anion production in both non-trained and trained swimmers. In non-trained swimmers, the number of latex particles internalized by each cell was decreased and further reduced by the drug. In trained rats treated with diazepam, the percentage of phagocytosing cells remained reduced compared to controls, whereas the drug prevented a decrease in the engulfing capacity of individual cells. Diazepam lowered the suppressed proliferative response of the splenocytes to PHA found in non-trained swimmers. It is concluded that diazepam modifies the immune response of rats exposed to acute and chronic swim stress.", 
    "10": "In the present study, the antinociceptive effect of cholecystokinin receptor agonists in the hot-plate test in mice has been evaluated. Subcutaneous administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (cholecystokinin-8; 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg), unsulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (cholecystokinin-8U; 0.1 mg/kg) or caerulein (0.25 mg/kg) produced antinociception. Administration of the cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (cholecystokinin-4; 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) had no effect in the hot-plate test. Subcutaneous injection of the selective cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, MK-329 (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) or L-365,260 (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), produced no antinociceptive response. When the animals were pretreated with the cholecystokinin receptor antagonists or naloxone (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), a significant decrease in the antinociceptive response induced by cholecystokinin-8 and caerulein was obtained. The results indicate that single administration of cholecystokinin receptor agonists could produce an antinociceptive effect which is probably mediated via cholecystokinin receptors. With respect to the results obtained from morphine and naloxone administration, it is concluded that there may be an interaction between cholecystokinin and opiate mechanisms.",

    "15": "The onset of hepatic encephalopathy is a multifactorial process in which endogenous benzodiazepines and hyperammonemia play a pivotal role. The treatment of comatose states in liver failure is one of the major functions of a bioartificial liver. A controlled study demonstrating the capacity of a large scale bioartificial liver to detoxify benzodiazepines could be a crucial prerequisite to break this circle of events leading to coma. The aim of this study was therefore to expose the bioreactor to high levels of benzodiazepines and ammonia for evaluation of its detoxifying capacity. We have developed a novel and unique device reconstructing the plate architecture of the liver. Porcine hepatocytes were co-cultured with non-parenchymal cells. We investigated benzodiazepine metabolism using diazepam as model drug. The bioreactor was also loaded with high levels of ammonia and ammonia clearance as well as urea secretion with ammonia challenge were investigated. Albumin secretion was analysed in parallel as a control viability and tissue specific secretory parameter. The results clearly show that the velocity of diazepam turnover increases between day 1 and 2 and stabilises at high levels. Typical diazepam metabolites including temazepam, N-desmethyl-diazepam and oxazepam were generated. Cell specific functions, including albumin secretion, were comparable to an in vivo liver. We conclude that the flat membrane bioreactor used as bioartificial liver has the potential to detoxify diazepam and ammonia at significant amounts. Maintenance of monoxygenase activities in vitro is one of the strongholds of the bioreactor concept presented in this study.", 
    "16": "The goals of the work reported here were (i) to identify distinct GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors in the rat hippocampus and olfactory bulb using receptor binding assays, and (ii) to determine the affinities and selectivities of benzodiazepine receptor ligands from structurally diverse chemical families at each site identified. These studies were aided by the use of software AFFINITY ANALYSIS SYSTEM, developed in our laboratory for analysis of receptor binding data that allows the determination of receptor heterogeneity using non-selective radioligands. Saturation binding assays using [3H]RO15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1, 5-a]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) revealed two binding sites in each of these two tissues. The higher affinity site corresponds to alpha(5) subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor and the lower affinity site to a combination of alpha(1), alpha(2), and alpha(3) subunit-containing receptors. These results should be useful in the challenging task of identifying the various functional GABA(A) receptors in the central nervous system, and in providing a link between receptor affinities and in vivo activities of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor ligands studied.", 
    "17": "Field potentials were recorded from rat hippocampal slices in order to compare the electrophysiological action of the new antiepileptic drug (AED), levetiracetam (LEV), with that of the classical AEDs, valproate, clonazepam and carbamazepine, on epileptiform responses induced by a 'high K(+)-low Ca(2+)' perfusion fluid. Increasing [K(+)] from 3 to 7.5 mM and decreasing [Ca(2+)] from 2.4 to 0.5 mM, in the bathing fluid, produced population spikes (PSs) of increasing amplitudes in the CA3 area of the slices, repetitive PSs evoked by single stimuli, and spontaneous bursts. Clinically relevant concentrations of LEV, 32 and 100 micro M, consistently reduced the second (PS(2)) and third (PS(3)) population spikes, and the number (N) of repetitive PSs per evoked response. Levetiracetam 32 micro M also opposed the increase in amplitude of the first PS (Delta PS(1)). Neither valproate 1 mM, nor clonazepam 1 micro M, nor carbamazepine 50 micro M, produced any decrease in Delta PS(1)and in PS(2), but all decreased N. These results show that LEV contrasts to reference AEDs by its ability to antagonize neuronal (hyper)synchronization, in the highly seizure-prone CA3 area of rat hippocampal slices.", 
    "18": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding pocket within the GABA(A) receptor complex has been suggested to contain arginine residues. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by mutating arginine residues potentially contributing to the formation of a GABA binding pocket. Thus, six arginines conserved in human GABA(A) receptor alpha subunits (arginine 34, 70, 77, 123, 135, and 224) as well as two nonconserved arginines (79 and 190), all located in the extracellular N-terminal segment of the alpha(5) subunit, were substituted by lysines. The individual alpha(5) subunit mutants were coexpressed with human beta(2) and gamma(2s) GABA(A) receptor subunits in Chinese hamster ovary cells by transient transfection. Electrophysiological whole-cell patch-clamp recordings show that, of the eight arginine residues tested, the two arginines at positions 70 and 123 appear to be essential for the GABA-gated chloride current because the EC(50) values of the two mutant constructs increase >100-fold compared with the wild-type alpha(5),beta(2), gamma(2s) GABA(A) receptor. However, diazepam and allopregnanolone modulation and pentobarbital stimulation properties are unaffected by the introduction of lysines at positions 70 and 123. A double mutant carrying lysine substitutions at positions 70 and 123 is virtually insensitive to GABA, suggesting alterations of one or more GABA binding sites.",

This paper reports the distribution of ODN-related peptides, investigated for the first time by immunocytochemistry, in different brain and pituitary regions of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa. Immunoreactive ODN-like material was found in the telencephalon at the level of bundles of different olfactory nerve fibres. Moreover, at the level of the pallium, immunoreactive multipolar neurons were observed in the pars parvocellularis of the stratum griseum superficialis. Similar immunopositive nerve cell bodies were found in the nucleus medialis of the central prosencephalic complex. In the mesencephalon, few immunoreactive neurons lining and contacting the mesencephalic ventricle were detected; such nerve cells could be involved in the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis. Dorsally in the mesencephalon, numerous ODN-containing cell bodies were present in the area praetectalis. The rhomboencephalon was immunostained only in the octavolateral area and in the nucleus motorius magnocellularis of the trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, ODN immunoreactivity was also present in the nerve cells of ganglia of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve complex. The immunocytochemical patterns described here in the brain of M. glutinosa suggest an involvement of ODN-like peptides as neuromodulators in sensory pathways, such as olfactory and visual. Finally, ODN-like substances were localized in discrete populations of adenohypophysial cells and in tanycytes lining the neurohypophyseal walls, suggesting for endozepines a paracrine and/or endocrine control of pituitary hormones release and a neurohormone role respectively. These results could give new insights into the chemioarchitecture of the brain of myxinoids.",

Mental status in this syndrome can range from subtle deficits to coma, with respiratory insufficiency and aspiration to the lungs. The mortality is high. The pathogenesis of HE is not clearly understood. One theory is that it reflects a metabolic disorder of the brain, developed from neuroactive nitrogenous metabolites in the gut that accumulate in plasma when there is an impaired hepatocellular extraction or porto-systemic shunting. Transient improvement of the condition is seen in a subgroup of patients after administration of flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist. The group of patients with a positive response to flumazenil therapy may have a better prognosis. Flumazenil may be used in patients in the pretransplantation phase.",

A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55), or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively.

    "30": "The use of coelocentesis to study placental drug transfer in the first trimester has required the adaptation of existing pharmacologic models to the changing anatomical structures present before and after 12 weeks of gestation. The biochemical properties of the coelomic and amniotic fluids are important parameters in evaluating the pharmacokinetics of drugs and toxins in early pregnancy. In particular, the protein concentration and pH of these fluids are significantly different and vary widely with gestational age. These biochemical variations are less likely to influence the distribution of inert substances such as inulin inside the first trimester conception cavities than the distribution of drugs such as diazepam or propofol. This can explain why they are not all accumulating inside the exocoelomic cavity. It has been demonstrated that the permeability of the placenta is greater in early pregnancy than at term. Furthermore, because of the slow turn-over of the coelomic fluid, substances such as nicotine to which the mother is chronically exposed accumulate inside the exocoelomic cavity. This prolonged fetal exposure to tobacco carcinogens has important teratogenic implications and should be further explored.", 
    "31": "Benzodiazepines have been reported to induce eating when administered into the brainstem of rats (either the fourth ventricle or the parabrachial nucleus). Benzodiazepines in the brainstem also have been reported to enhance the hedonic impact of taste, as measured by hedonic/aversive taste reactivity patterns, when administered to the fourth ventricle. The present study examined whether the parabrachial nucleus in particular is a brainstem site of the benzodiazepine-produced enhancement of eating and palatability. Food intake (cereal mash) was measured after brainstem microinjections of midazolam or vehicle (0.0, 7.5, and 15.0 microg) into the parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, or the fourth ventricle (60 microg). We used the taste reactivity paradigm to measure hedonic/aversive affective reactions elicited from rats by oral infusions of a bittersweet solution (7% sucrose-0.01% quinine). Positive hedonic reactions and negative aversive reactions to sucrose-quinine were also measured after microinjections of midazolam (0.0, 7.5, and 15 microg) into the parabrachial nucleus. Midazolam increased food intake and selectively enhanced positive hedonic taste reactivity patterns to the bittersweet solution when microinjections were delivered to the parabrachial nucleus. When administered to the other brainstem sites at the same doses, however, midazolam had no effect. We therefore conclude that the parabrachial nucleus can mediate the benzodiazepine-induced enhancement of the hedonic impact of taste as well as mediating the enhancement of eating behavior.", 
    "32": "The aim of this study was to determine whether intranasal midazolam is a safe and effective rescue medication in adolescent and adult patients with severe epilepsy. This field trial was designed to test the feasibility of the use of intranasal midazolam as an alternative to rectal diazepam in a cohort of patients with severe epilepsy who require rescue medication as part of their treatment. A dose of intranasal midazolam (5 mg if the patient weighed less than 50 kg and 10 mg if the patient weighed over 50 kilograms) was prescribed for those who had previously responded to other rescue medication. Midazolam was prescribed buccally if excessive head movement accompanied seizures. The protocol reverted to the usual rescue medication if there was no response to midazolam within 10 minutes. Vital signs were monitored for half an hour following the administration of the treatment. Twenty-two patients received 84 treatment episodes and 79 of these were considered clinically effective. Five treatment failures were recorded, three due to poor technique in delivering the midazolam. Two patients were successfully retried on midazolam and a third is awaiting a retrial of this drug. The two other treatment failures received the drug buccally. In the first patient the clinical opinion was that this was possibly a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. The other patient responded initially, but within an hour had another seizure requiring further rescue treatment. No significant adverse effects were reported. Our study shows that intranasal midazolam, when used appropriately, is an effective treatment in those who require rescue treatment. There are clear advantages in the use of midazolam over diazepam in the treatment of acute seizures. These include the favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam as well as the potential of a more acceptable and dignified administration route.", 
    "33": "Benzodiazepine receptors and abnormal hepatic metabolism have been suggested to participate in several neuropsychiatric disorders including autism. Neuropsychoactive beta-carboline alkaloids as the potent ligands for benzodiazepine receptors are endogenously produced and exogenously supplied much more than benzodiazepines. 1-Methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline, a predominant alkaloid in humans and foodstuffs, is metabolically hydroxylated in liver. Although its in vivo levels show no difference between autistic and healthy children, the metabolic 6-hydroxylation is significantly decreased in autistic subjects. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the reduced hepatic metabolism of 1-methyl-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline to 6-hydroxyl metabolite may be linked to the pathogenesis of infantile autism as suggested for autistic occurrence to involve the pathology similar to hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "34": "We report on a patient who had taken the centrally acting analgesic tramadol for over 1 year. The compound had proven to be sufficient to treat her painful episodes related to fibromyalgia. Due to lack of supply while being on a trip, intake of the drug was stopped abruptly, resulting in the development of classical abstinence-like symptoms within 1 week. Abstinence-like symptoms consisted of restlessness and insomnia for which the benzodiazepine lorazepam was given. Diarrhoea and abdominal cramps were treated with the peripherally active opioid loperamide, while bouts of cephalgia were treated with sumatriptan. Diffuse musculoskeletal-related pain and restless leg syndrome (RLS) were treated with dextromethorphan. All these different medications proved to be efficacious as they resulted in the cessation of symptoms. Within 1 week symptoms ceased and the patient regained her normal activities without any sequelae. Although tramadol is considered a non-habit- and non-dependence-forming analgesic, abstinence symptoms are likely to develop following abrupt cessation of intake, especially when the compound had been taken over 1 year. Therefore patients should be advised of such an effect whenever they decide to stop intake or their physician is planning to switch to another medication. To avoid abstinence-like symptoms doses should be slowly tapered down.",

Several studies in animals have suggested that decreased activity of the inhibitory GABAergic neurones is responsible for driving these changes. However, whether similar mechanisms sustain the effects in the longer term in humans is unknown. The present study addressed this question by examining reorganisation of sensorimotor areas of cortex in six unilateral upper limb amputees several years after the initial injury. We measured two independent indices of GABAergic function. Volumes of distribution of GABA(A) receptors were determined from 11C-flumazenil binding measured with positron emission tomography (PET). The strength of inhibition in the motor cortex was measured with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. In the six amputees taken as a whole and compared with 24 normal subjects, there was a highly significant increase in 11C-flumazenil binding in the upper limb region of primary sensorimotor cortex bilaterally and in medial frontal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the amputation. Surprisingly, however, there was no change in the time course or strength of intra-cortical inhibition in the motor cortex of the amputees compared with matched control subjects. The increased 11C-flumazenil binding may reflect up-regulation of GABA(A) receptors to compensate for a decrease in the GABA content or activity of inhibitory neurones. Up-regulation of GABA(A) receptors may also indicate that long-term changes require stabilisation of cortical organisation.",

In this report we examine the ability of midazolam to potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated inhibition recorded from cerebellar Purkinje neurons using extracellular recording methods. We report that when midazolam is applied concurrently with GABA from glass multibarrel electrodes that midazolam potentiates GABA mediated inhibition in 46% of Purkinje neurons in 3-month-old F344 rats, 63% of neurons in 18-month-old F344 rats and 54% of cells in 24-month-old F344 rats. Thus, there is no age related decline in function of this response. In fact, the response to midazolam is significantly increased in 18-month-old rats.",

This preinduction regimen was developed to produce heavy sedation or even light anesthesia in order to eliminate the need for or at least minimize the stress of darting with tiletamine/zolazepam at 3 mg/kg i.m. This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of transmucosal carfentanil. Once each animal was unresponsive to external stimuli, or at approximately 25 min (range 24-34 min) after carfentanil administration, naltrexone and tiletamine/zolazepam (N/T/Z) were combined into one intramuscular injection for anesthetic induction. Naltrexone was administered at 100 times the carfentanil dose in milligrams. For comparison, two chimpanzees received only droperidol, 2.5 mg p.o., followed by tiletamine/zolazepam, 3 mg/kg i.m. The preinduction period for all animals receiving carfentanil was characterized as smooth, with chimpanzees becoming gradually less active and less responsive to external stimuli. Two animals became very heavily sedated at 24 and 35 min, respectively, and were hand injected with N/T/Z. The other three chimpanzees became sternally recumbent but retained some response to stimuli, and N/T/Z was administered by remote injection with minimal response. Rectal body temperatures, pulse and respiratory rates, arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation, and arterial blood gases were measured at initial contact (t = 0 min) and at 10-min intervals thereafter. Respiratory depression was present in all chimpanzees, regardless of protocol. Mean hemoglobin saturation was 91% for both groups. Mean partial pressure of oxygen, arterial values for carfentanil-treated and control animals were 64.4 +/- 7.6 and 63.5 +/- 6.0 at t = 0, respectively. Only the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, arterial (Paco2) and pH showed significant differences between treated and control animals. Mean Paco2 was greater and mean pH lower for the carfentanil-treated group compared with the controls at t = 0 (58.9 +/- 3.7 and 50.3 +/- 3.1 for Paco2 and 7.33 +/- 0.02 and 7.40 +/- 0.30 for pH, respectively). The results of this study suggest that oral droperidol followed by transmucosal carfentanil can be used effectively as a premedication regimen to produce profound sedation, which limits the stress of darting during parenteral anesthetic induction with tiletamine/zolazepam in chimpanzees. The main side effect of respiratory depression appears to be adequately managed by reversing the carfentanil at the time of induction.",

Medical conditions and medications have been hypothesized as determinants of crash involvement. This population-based case-control study sought to identify medical conditions and medications associated with risk of at-fault crashes among older drivers. A total of 901 drivers aged 65 years and older were selected in 1996 from Alabama Department of Public Safety driving records: 244 at-fault drivers involved in crashes; 182 not at-fault drivers involved in crashes; and 475 drivers not involved in crashes were enrolled. Information on demographic factors, chronic medical conditions, medications, driving habits, visual function, and cognitive status was collected. Older drivers with heart disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 2.2) or stroke (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 0.9, 3.9) were more likely to be involved in at-fault automobile crashes. Arthritis was also associated with an increased risk among females (OR =1.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.9). Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.0, 2.6), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 1.6, 95 CI: 1.0, 2.7), and anticoagulants (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0, 73) was associated with an increased risk of at-fault involvement in crashes.

    "48": "Blood pressure in some elderly hypertensive patients is characterized by marked lability. This affects quality of life and may deteriorate prognosis. Conventional anti-hypertensive medication does not lead to stabilization of blood pressure. We call this form of hypertension \"labile hypertension of the elderly\" (LHE). The aim of the study was investigation of autonomic regulation of blood pressure and of clonazepam effectiveness in patients with LHE. Fifty-six patients with LHE (mean age 67.0 +/- 6.3 years) entered the study (87.5% women). Control group consisted of 38 patients with stable hypertension and 27 normotensives matched by sex and age. The patients and the controls underwent clinical and psychological examinations, regular measurement of blood pressure during one month before and after the treatment, cardiovascular tests and spectral analysis of the heart rate variability. It was found that LHE patients have higher level of anxiety and depression, low standard deviation of RR interval, low normalized LF and HF components and increased normalized VLF component. The cardiovascular tests showed signs of diminished parasympathetic regulation. Clonazepam treatment in a dose 1-2 mg/day brought about a significant stabilization of blood pressure in 82.0% of patients with LHE. Thus, LHE is an original form of hypertension in patients over 60 years old characterized by frequent, short-term, small symptomatic, spontaneous fluctuations of blood pressure with development of both hypertensive and hypotensive reactions. Pathogenesis of LHE is linked with disorders of heart rate autonomic regulation, marked anxiety and depression. Clonazepam stabilizes blood pressure in most LHE cases.", 
    "49": "The complicated mechanisms of drug dependency were discussed from the perspective of a reward, especially the perspective of psychic dependency of the brain. In Kato's article, the following questions were raised. (1) Improper usage of terminology in describing the objective pharmacological behavior and describing the subjective psychic experience, e.g. the term \"obsessional comfort\". (2) The enhanced effects of morphine and d-amphetamine in ICSS (intracranial self-stimulation) were not suitably regarded, as these might be the results of stimulus current running in the brain. The conclusion that \"morphine and d-amphetamine are 2 kinds of addictive drugs due to the reinforcement effects on ICSS\" appears to be putting the incidental before the fundamental because these are addictive drugs in clinical use. (3) It was unknown why the basic problem of drug dependency was limited to psychic stimulant (antihypnotic, etc.), and why only opiates were represented as an addictive drug. (4) The conclusion that the reinforcement effects of barbital and benzodiazepine were not observed in ICSS contradicted Kato's conclusion, in which the reinforcement effects were detected in an experiment involving self-administration. (5) He reiterated that the usage of terminology was confused in describing the psychic experience and pharmacological behavioral. In response to the comments of the editors, I would answer the questions as follows: It is well-known that the terminologies used in psychiatry are strict and prudent. This should also be the case in the description of pharmacological behaviors in animal models. The author admitted Kato's profound relevant experiences in drug dependency, and did not disapprove of his criticisms about the terminology used in the article to describe objective behaviors and observe subjective experience. That article was excerpted from one of my lectures, which to some extent allowed freedom in phrases and sentences. The following are my answers to Kato's questions.",

Criminological investigation pointed to a homicide by poisoning but also the possibility of a suicide had to be taken in account. The toxicological analysis of blood, cerebral spinal fluid and urine revealed extremely high concentrations of melperone which had never been reported before.

They are used as anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, hypnotics or muscle relaxants with different duration of action. In this paper, a simple and sensitive method for the determination of benzodiazepines in whole blood using solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is described. The drugs spiked in whole blood were extracted with an Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridge (Waters), which contains a copolymer designed to have a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance. GC/MS analysis was performed using a Shimadzu QP-5000 equipped with a BPX5 capillary column (15 mx0.32 mm I.D., film thickness 0.25 microm, SGE). Nineteen benzodiazepines and two thienodiazepines were well separated from each other on their SIM chromatograms and also on the TIC with the exception of oxazolam to cloxazolam separation. The blank extract from whole blood gave no peaks that interfered with all benzodiazepines and thienodiazepines on the chromatogram. The calibration curves for selected benzodiazepines with fludiazepam as an internal standard showed excellent linearity over the concentration range 5-500 ng/ml blood with a correlation coefficients of >0.995. The detection limits ranged from 0.2 to 20 ng/ml blood. The method is simple and sensitive for the determination of benzodiazepines in whole blood and seems to be useful in the practice of forensic science.", 
    "56": "Fentanyl is a very strong opioid with analgesic properties that are approximately 80 times stronger than those of morphine and therefore is used in major surgery and treatment of pain in tumor patients. Cases of fentanyl abuse by intravenous injection, inhalation, oral or nasal application have been reported especially in the USA. Therapeutic levels of fentanyl are as low as 1 ng/ml of serum and therefore a screening test must have a detection limit below that concentration. Recently three non-radioactive enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have become commercially available from COZART, STC and DIAGNOSTIX, all of them supplied by MAHSAN Diagnostika for evaluation with serum samples from forensic and clinical cases. A calibration curve is obtained with samples that contain 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 ng fentanyl per ml of negative serum. The calibration curve of COZART is especially in the low range, steeper than those of STC and DIAGNOSTIX. The cut-off for all these EIAs, however, can be set at 0.5 ng/ml. After the administration of therapeutic doses, fentanyl concentrations were between 3 and more than 5 ng/ml as determined with the EIAs. The presence of the typical drugs of abuse, e.g. heroin, methadone, cocaine, cannabinoids and amphetamines including the derivatives of methylenedioxyamphetamine, don't generate false-positive results. No cross-reactivity was also observed at toxic levels of benzodiazepines and paracetamol and therapeutic levels of barbiturates, phenothiazines, antidepressants and analgesics. The EIAs tested so far appear to be suitable for the detection of fentanyl at therapeutic levels. False-positive results or cross-reactivity towards other compounds have not been observed.",

The reaction mechanism of Friedel-Crafts alkylation/acylation with lactones in triflic acid is presented. According to our tentative research, ring opening of protonated lactone (2) occurs in alkyl cleavage and the rate of the reaction is not dependent on concentration of triflic acid. So, alkylation of lactone in Friedel-Crafts reaction is presumed to be A(AL)1. In second step, intramolecular acylation of the intermediates 4 to 6, 4 can be transformed to a triflic acid-carboxylic anhydride and then the cyclization is undergone after leaving of the triflate anion.",

    "63": "Transfected cells containing GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptors (BDZRs) have been utilized to systematically determine the affinity of ligands at alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5 and alpha6 subtypes in combination with beta2 and gamma2. All but a few of the ligands thus far studied have relatively high affinities for each of these alpha subtype receptors. Thus, these ligands must contain common stereochemical properties favorable for recognition by each of the subtype combinations. In the present work, such a common three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore for recognition of alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5 and alpha6 containing GABA(A)/BDZRs types of receptors has been developed and assessed, using as a database receptor affinities measured in transfected cells for 27 diverse compounds. The 3D-recognition pharmacophore developed consists of three proton accepting groups, a hydrophobic group, and the centroid of an aromatic ring found in a common geometric arrangement in the 19 nonselective ligands used. Three tests were made to assess this pharmacophore: (i) Four low affinity compounds were used as negative controls, (ii) Four high affinity compounds, excluded from the pharmacophore development, were used as compounds for pharmacophore validation, (iii) The 3D pharmacophore was used to search 3D databases. The results of each of these types of assessments provided robust validation of the 3D pharmacophore. This 3D pharmacophore can now be used to discover novel nonselective ligands that could be activation selective at different behavioral end points. Additionally, it may serve as a guide in the design of more selective ligands, by determining if candidate ligands proposed for synthesis conform to this pharmacophore and selecting those that do not for further experimental assessment.",

The present review provides a synthesis of existing literature on discriminative stimulus effects of BZ agonists in order to elucidate their underlying receptor mechanisms, specifically in terms of intrinsic efficacy and receptor selectivity. The available evidence suggests that receptor selectivity is a critical determinant of the discriminative stimulus effects of BZ agonists. In particular, BZ-1 receptors appear to play a fundamental role, whereas the role of BZ-2 receptors remains elusive. In addition, data from many drug discrimination studies suggest that the conventional BZ agonist chlordiazepoxide may have reduced intrinsic efficacy compared with other BZ agonists.",

This debate has been intensified by the suggestion that sedation may correlate with 'slow euthanasia'. The need to have more facts and less anecdote was a motivating factor in this multicentre study. Four palliative care programmes in Israel, South Africa, and Spain agreed to participate. The target population was palliative care patients in an inpatient setting. Information was collected on demographics, major symptom distress, and intent and need to use sedatives in the last week of life. Further data on level of consciousness, adequacy of symptom control, and opioids and psychotropic agents used during the final week of life was recorded. As the final week of life can be difficult to predict, treating physicians were asked to complete the data at the time of death. The data available for analysis included 100 patients each from Israel and Madrid, 94 patients from Durban, and 93 patients from Cape Town. More than 90% of patients required medical management for pain, dyspnoea, delirium and/or nausea in the final week of life. The intent to sedate varied from 15% to 36%, with delirium being the most common problem requiring sedation. There were variations in the need to sedate patients for dyspnoea, and existential and family distress. Midazolam was the most common medication prescribed to achieve sedation. The diversity in symptom distress, intent to sedate and use of sedatives, provides further knowledge in characterizing and describing the use of deliberate pharmacological sedation for problematic symptoms at the end of life. The international nature of the patient population studied enhances our understanding of potential differences in definition of symptom issues, variation of clinical practice, and cultural and psychosocial influences.",

    "73": "The involvement of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylizoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) was examined in rat hippocampal slice preparation. Using conventional extracellular recording, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and population action potentials (PSs), evoked by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibres, were recorded in the CA1 region. The effects of a competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, 6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline-2, 3-dione (NBQX), and that of a non-competitive blocker, 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) have been examined. 0.25-0.5 microM of NBQX and 20-40 microM of GYKI 52466 did not suppress the induction of LTP. LTP was attenuated only at the highest concentrations tested (1 microM NBQX or 80 microM GYKI 52466). These in vitro concentrations, however, exceed the brain levels needed for in vivo anticonvulsant action. Furthermore, even at the highest concentrations both compounds suppressed only the expression but not the induction of LTP. Namely after their washout LTP reappeared. Thus, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations these AMPA receptor antagonists apparently do not suppress LTP, a cellular mechanism underlying memory formation. These experiments suggest that in clinical practice AMPA receptor blockade may have some advantage over N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism, which is accompanied by severe memory impairment.", 
    "74": "Although carbamazepine (CBZ) is used therapeutically in the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric conditions, its mechanism of action remains largely unknown. CBZ has now been shown to inhibit the binding of [(3)H]PK 11195 to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in rat brain and ovary membranes in vitro with a potency (IC(50), approximately 60 microM) much lower than that of unlabeled PK 11195 (IC(50), approximately 2.0 nM). Administration of CBZ to rats induced dose (25 to 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and time (15 to 60 min) dependent increases in the concentrations of pregnenolone, progesterone, allopregnanolone, and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone in both the cerebral cortex and plasma. CBZ also induced steroidogenesis in the brain of adrenalectomized-orchiectomized rats, suggesting that this effect is mediated in a manner independent of peripheral PBRs. The increase in brain concentrations of neuroactive steroids induced by a single injection of CBZ was associated with a marked protective effect against isoniazid-induced convulsions. In contrast, long-term administration of CBZ (50 mg/kg, twice a day for 30 days) induced tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of the drug. This same treatment, however, did not prevent the ability of a challenge dose of CBZ to stimulate steroidogenesis.

Consistent with its proposed mechanism of action, these anxiolytic effects of L-701,324 (7.5 mg/kg) are reversed by pretreatment with glycine (500 and 800 mg/kg). Chronic treatment with citalopram (20 mg/kg for 21 days), imipramine (15 mg/kg for 21 days) and electroconvulsive shock (ECS, for 8 days), produced a reduction in the anxiolytic-like actions of L-701,324 (7.5 mg/kg) such that they could not be reversed by glycine. In contrast, the anxiolytic effects of L-701,324 and reversal of these effects by glycine were unaffected by acute treatment with imipramine, chronic administration with placebo or the neuroleptic chlorpromazine, or sham ECS. Further, imipramine administered for 21 days did not affect the anxiolytic effect of 5 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide. The apparent reduction in the anxiolytic-like actions of a specific glycine/NMDA receptor antagonist following chronic treatment with a variety of antidepressants is consistent with previous neurochemical and molecular studies indicating that chronic antidepressant treatment can affect NMDA receptor function.", 
    "76": "Benzodiazepines enhance coronary blood flow and lower blood pressure, but the cellular basis of this action remains unclear. The present study now demonstrates a direct effect of diazepam, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and progesterone on the large conductance, Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K(+) channel (BK(Ca)) in single myocytes isolated from porcine coronary arteries. These GABA receptor agonists significantly increased whole-cell (perforated patch) K(+) currents and stimulated the activity of single BK(Ca) channels in cell-attached patches dramatically. This effect is not mediated via cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP, but involves stimulation of Ca(2+) influx in response to activation of a bicuculline-sensitive GABA(A)-like receptor. We propose that localized, subsarcolemmal increases in Ca(2+) levels open BK(Ca) channels, thereby promoting K(+) efflux, membrane repolarization, and coronary relaxation. This transduction pathway can now account, at least in part, for the direct vasodilatory effects of diazepam, progesterone, and GABA.", 
    "77": "In the presence of diazepam, [3H]phenytoin binds with high affinity to brain membranes. The present experiments examined whether this high affinity [3H]phenytoin-binding site co-localized with the standard [3H]phenytoin-binding site on the voltage-dependent sodium channel (VDSC). Veratridine, a pharmacological activator of the voltage-dependent sodium channel, that inhibits standard [3H]phenytoin binding, failed to affect the high affinity diazepam-potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding in brain membranes, suggesting that the potentiated binding interaction resides at a site distinct from the voltage-dependent sodium channel. This possibility was confirmed by anion exchange chromatography of digitonin-solubilized rat brain membranes, as diazepam-potentiated high affinity [3H]phenytoin binding eluted in column fractions that were distinct from [3H]saxitoxin-defined voltage-dependent sodium channels. To examine whether diazepam-potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding might be associated with other 'classic' benzodiazepine receptor sites, we tested whether specific ligands for benzodiazepine receptors would either produce or block potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding. Neither agonists, nor antagonists, of the high affinity central-type benzodiazepine receptor affected potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding, suggesting that the high affinity potentiated binding site is not likely associated with central benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor agonists, however, did potentiate [3H]phenytoin binding, and a specific receptor antagonist (PK11195) attenuated the potentiation seen with diazepam. Overall, these data illustrate that [3H]phenytoin interacts with a novel site in brain membranes that is distinct from the voltage-dependent sodium channel and is allosterically revealed by peripheral-type, but not central-type, benzodiazepine receptor agonists.", 
    "78": "The latent inhibition (LI) phenomenon refers to the retardation in learning of an association between a stimulus and a consequence if that stimulus had been previously experienced without consequence. An earlier study demonstrated that the benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP), when administered before the phase of preexposure to the to-be-conditioned stimulus, impaired animals' ability to develop LI. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of the anxiogenic drugs pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist Ro15-4513 on LI. Both anxiogenics, in contrast to CDP, are known for their GABA inhibitory action. The effects produced by the combined administration of a GABAergic function facilitator and inhibitor (CDP/PTZ and CDP/Ro15-4513) were also investigated. Both anxiogenic drugs led to an attenuation of LI, and, similarly to CDP, this attenuation was exclusively due to their administration prior to the preexposure stage of the experiment. However, this effect was abolished when anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs were administered together, suggesting a pharmacological rather than behavioral summation of effects. These data also demonstrate the bidirectional GABAergic modulation of the LI phenomenon: both increased and decreased GABA(A) receptor activation led to reduced LI, thereby suggesting that an optimal receptor activation level is necessary for the normal establishment of LI.", 
    "79": "This study examines whether the hormonal condition of the rat modifies the effects of diazepam (0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg) on avoidance conditioning and other behavioral responses. Acquisition of a conditioning avoidance response (CAR) and spontaneous motor behaviors were assessed in intact male, in intact diestrous and estrous females, and in ovariectomized (OVX) rats injected with estradiol (2 microg/rat, SC) or progesterone (5 mg/rat, SC). A higher dose (1.0 mg/kg) of diazepam significantly impaired the acquisition of CARs in diestrous, OVX, OVX + progesterone, and male rats. Conversely, both doses of diazepam significantly improved the acquisition of CAR in estrous rats and in OVX rats injected with estradiol. These effects on conditioning avoidance were not accompanied with equivalent changes in spontaneous motor behaviors. Motor activity and grooming behavior decreased in all experimental groups after administration of 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam. On the contrary, diazepam 0.25 mg/kg increased motor activity in estrous, OVX + estradiol, and OVX + progesterone rats after, whereas grooming behavior was not affected in any group. These findings suggest a physiological influence of ovarian steroid hormones in modifying the benzodiazepine effects on conditioning avoidance and motor activity. The results are discussed considering that ovarian steroids may interact with diazepam on the GABA(A)/benzodiazapine/chloride ionophore complex, modifying the coupling between benzodiazepine sites and GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "80": "These studies were undertaken to 1) determine whether repeated dosing with the peripheral benzodiazepine antagonist PK 11195 alters its ability to precipitate withdrawal abstinence in diazepam-dependent rats; 2) whether the administration of PK 11195 and the central benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, 3 days apart to the same rat produces an ordering effect in the intensity of withdrawal abstinence; 3) whether there are gender differences in these effects. Age-matched male and female Sprague Dawley rats had capsules implanted weekly that contained approximately equal (mg/kg) doses of diazepam (120 and 90 mg, respectively) or empty capsules (controls). After 5 implants, the maximum precipitated withdrawal score (PAS(MAX)) induced by PK 11195 and/or flumazenil (10 mg/kg/IV, respectively) was measured. Repeated administration of PK 11195 (1x/day for 5 days) induced tolerance with regard to the intensity of the PAS(MAX) and with gender-related differences. When PK 11195 was administered weekly (5 weeks), rather than daily, tolerance did not develop in either sex. The PK 11195- and flumazenil-induced PAS(MAX) was not changed by the order in which they were administered. There were gender differences in that females had a higher PAS(MAX) after flumazenil than after PK 11195 and vocalized more after all treatments than males.", 
    "81": "The pharmacological effects of 4-phenyl-2-trichloromethyl-3H-1, 5-benzodiazepine hydrogen sulfate (PTMB), a novel synthetic benzodiazepine, were examined in mice. In the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety, 0.3-1 mg/kg diazepam ip (F(3,53) = 3.78; P<0.05) and 1-10 mg/kg PTMB ip increased (F(5,98) = 3.26; P<0.01), whereas 2 mg/kg picrotoxin ip decreased (F(3,59) = 8.32; P<0.001) the proportion of time spent in the open arms, consistent with an anxiolytic action of both benzodiazepines, and an anxiogenic role for picrotoxin. In the holeboard, 1.0 mg/kg diazepam ip increased (F(3,54) = 2.78; P<0.05) and 2 mg/kg picrotoxin ip decreased (F(3, 59) = 4.69; P<0.01) locomotor activity. Rotarod assessment revealed that 1 mg/kg diazepam ip and 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg PTMB ip produced significant motor incoordination compared to vehicle control (F(4, 70) = 7.6; P<0.001).

The new antipsychotics have proven to be more effective than the old ones in reducing the negative symptoms and in improving the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Moreover, they indeed induce less extrapyramidal side effects than the older antipsychotics. Head-to-head comparisons of the atypical antipsychotics are sparse.

    "107": "The significance of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) concentration in comparison with hippocampal metabolism and volumetry was assessed in 14 patients diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) without hippocampal signal change on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Focus lateralization was achieved by clinical, electroencephalographic and neuropsychological examinations. Three-dimensional positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI scans were coregistered for determination of hippocampal 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) binding, normalized to average cortical values for glucose metabolism (rCMRglc) and volume. The hippocampi were individually outlined on T1-weighted MRI. Volumes of interest (VOI) were used for calculation of asymmetries between clinically affected and unaffected sides. Eleven out of 14 TLE patients presented a significant reduction in hippocampal volume. In nine of these 11 patients hippocampal FMZ binding and in seven cases hippocampal CMRglc was also reduced. In two patients without hippocampal volume asymmetry FMZ binding was markedly reduced in the mesial temporal lobe appropriately to the clinically diagnosed side. In our study volumetry is therefore the most sensitive tool for the detection of hippocampal abnormality in TLE. However, in cases without hippocampal atrophy the reduction of FMZ may indicate functional impairment of BZR before neuronal loss becomes evident.

    "113": "Using distinct models of apoptosis and necrosis, we have investigated the effect of mitochondrial Ca(2+)(Ca(m)) homeostasis in the regulation of cell death in neuroblastoma cells as well as cardiac myocytes. The steady state level of Ca(m)was determined as the FCCP-releasable Ca(2+). Culturing cells with low concentration of extracellular Ca(2+)(Ca(o)) or with EGTA triggered an early reduction in both the Ca(m)store and the membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). This was followed by the detection of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore such as cyclosporin A and Bcl-2 blocked the release of Ca(m)and inhibited apoptosis. In contrast, mitochondrial Ca(2+)overload resulted in necrotic cell death. Culturing cells in the presence of excess Ca(o)led to increased Ca(m)load together with a decrease of DeltaPsi(m)that reached maximum at 1 h, with necrosis occurring at 2 h. While the decline of Ca(m)and DeltaPsi(m)was a coupled reaction for apoptosis, this relationship was uncoupled during necrosis. Clonazepam, a relatively specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na/Ca exchanger, was able to protect the cells from necrosis by reducing Ca(m)overload. Importantly, combination of clonazepam and cyclosporin showed a cooperative effect in further reducing the Ca(m)overload and abolished cell death. The data imply the participation of Ca(m)homeostasis in the regulation of apoptosis and necrosis.",

This study aimed to evaluate performance-enhancing drug use among medical students at the University Hospital of Nancy, France. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire was given to all 104 eighth-year residents. The 93 responding students (37 female and 56 male), were aged 28.0 +/- 2.2 years (mean +/- SD); 53 per cent of the subjects reported enhancing-substance use in their first year of medical studies (72 per cent during preparation for their difficult examinations and 28 per cent throughout the year). The main substances were vitamins, anti-fatigue capsules, betablockers, marijuana (illicit drug) and benzodiazepines; 46 per cent of them were still using these drugs during the second to sixth years of their medical course. The main sources of drugs were retail pharmacists, with or without medical prescriptions. Could this use persist and lead to doctors with substance problems?", 
    "125": "The drugs most diverted for toxicomanic use from their therapeutic indication are principally the opioids or related substances, with codeine still high in importance, in spite of the wide prescription of substitution treatments. The psychotropic drugs, essentially the benzodiazepines and the stimulant antidepressants such as amineptine, are also frequently used. The market withdrawal of amineptine should diminish its misuse. The abuse of amphetamines-anorectics and barbiturates seems to be regressing. Nevertheless, substances such as nitrous oxide and ketamine are the subject of selective, recent misuse. Moreover high-dose buprenorphine misuse, as a concomitant buprenorphine-benzodiazepine combination and/or an intravenous injection of high doses of buprenorphine, can be implicated in severe adverse effects. Twenty-one lethal intoxications linked to such drug misuse have already been reported. However, the addictive drug potential is not the only explanation for drugs diverted for toxicomanic use. It is also associated with a polytoxicomania, a symptom of pre-existing difficulties, particularly familial, social and environmental in origin. Therefore, the therapeutic regime should be adapted to the drug addict's personality. We report a few cases of polydrug abusers, treated with methadone in a specialist unit. The misuse and the practical therapeutic response, adapted to each case, are compared and discussed in respect of the data published in the literature.", 
    "126": "In positron emission tomography (PET) studies of diseased animals, it is very useful to have accurate anatomical information as a reference. In human studies, anatomical information is usually obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the subject with retrospective registration of the subject's PET image to the MRI. A number of PET-MRI registration techniques are used for this purpose. However, the utility of these methods has not been tested for animals image registration. This paper studies the feasibility of applying two currently used human brain PET-MRI registration techniques to cat brain images.", 
    "127": "Three cats were anesthetized with isoflurane gas, and PET images were acquired with H(2)(15)O, benzodiazepine receptor ligand 11C-flumazemil (FMZ), dopamine receptor ligand 11C-nemonapride (NEM) and fluorodeoxy glucose (18F-FDG). The four PET scans were acquired consecutively within the same day while the cat remained fixed in the scanner. We also obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI of the cats in a 4.7 T unit. The PET images were registered to MRI using two human brain registration techniques: a semi-automatic method (SAM), which is a two-step method based on the extraction of the midsagittal plane, and an automatic method (AMIR) method that minimizes PET pixel variance within spatially connected segments determined by MRI.", 
    "128": "T2-weighted MRI provided better structural information than T1 MRI. FMZ did, while FDG or H(2)O PET images did not, provide a structural outline of the brain. The FMZ PET image was registered to MRI satisfactorily using SAM. The striatum visualized in nemonapride PET image re-sliced with the same parameters matched the striatum identified in T2-weighted MRI. Registration by AMIR was successful by inspection for FMZ, FDG or H(2)O PET images in only one of the three cats. The registration error of SAM was estimated to be less than 2 mm or 2 degrees.",

Ranitidine did not affect the expression of E-selectin on endothelial cells in vitro. Ranitidine significantly inhibited gastric accumulation of neutrophils and gastric mucosal lipid peroxidation in rats subjected to stress. Although oral administration of acid reversed the preventive effect of pirenzepine, an anti-cholinergic drug that inhibits gastric acid secretion, it did not affect the preventive effect of ranitidine.

    "145": "Nine volunteers received a 2-mg bolus loading dose of lorazepam, coincident with the start of a 2 microg/kg/hr zero-order infusion. The infusion was stopped after 4 hrs. Plasma lorazepam concentrations and electroencephalographic activity in the 13- to 30-Hz range were monitored for 24 hrs.", 
    "146": "The bolus-plus-infusion scheme rapidly produced plasma lorazepam concentrations that were close to those predicted to be achieved at true steady state. Mean kinetic values for lorazepam were as follows: volume of distribution, 126 L; elimination half-life, 13.8 hrs; and clearance, 109 mL/min. Electroencephalographic effects were maximal 0.5 hr after the loading dose, were maintained essentially constant during infusion, and then declined in parallel with plasma concentrations after the infusion was terminated. There was no evidence of tolerance. Plots of pharmacodynamic electroencephalographic effect vs. plasma lorazepam concentration demonstrated counterclockwise hysteresis, consistent with an effect-site equilibration delay. This was incorporated into a kinetic-dynamic model in which hypothetical effect-site concentration was related to pharmacodynamic electroencephalographic effect via the sigmoid Emax model. The analysis yielded the following mean estimates: maximum electroencephalographic effect, 12.7% over baseline; 50% effective concentration, 13.1 ng/mL; and effect-site equilibration half-life, 8.8 mins.",

    "148": "The peroxisome proliferator perfluordecanoic acid (PFDA) has been shown to exert an antiandrogenic effect in vivo by acting directly on the interstitial Leydig cells of the testis. The objective of this study was to examine the in vitro effects of PFDA and identify its site of action in steroidogenesis using as model systems the mouse tumor MA-10 and isolated rat Leydig cells. PFDA inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner the hCG-stimulated Leydig cell steroidogenesis. This effect was localized at the level of cholesterol transport into the mitochondria. PFDA did not affect either the total cell protein synthesis or the mitochondrial integrity. Moreover, it did not induce any DNA damage. Morphological studies indicated that PFDA induced lipid accumulation in the cells, probably due to the fact that cholesterol mobilized by hCG did not enter the mitochondria to be used for steroidogenesis. In search of the target of PFDA, we examined its effect on key regulatory mechanisms of steroidogenesis. PFDA did not affect the hCG-induced steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) levels. However, it was found to inhibit the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand binding capacity, 18-kDa protein, and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Further studies indicated that PFDA did not affect PBR transcription, but it rather accelerated PBR mRNA decay. Taken together, these data suggest that PFDA inhibits the Leydig cell steroidogenesis by affecting PBR mRNA stability, thus inhibiting PBR expression, cholesterol transport into the mitochondria, and the subsequent steroid formation. Moreover, this action of PFDA on PBR mRNA stability indicates a new mechanism of action of peroxisome proliferators distinct from the classic transcription-mediated regulation of target genes.", 
    "149": "The use of benzodiazepines (BZD) or other psychotropic agents is an established risk factor for falls and hip fractures. The evidence supporting this association has been based solely on history and/or prescription data. In a case-control study we monitored the intake of BZD, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and barbiturates in patients with hip fracture by serum analysis, and compared this measurement with drug history and prescription records. The serum was BZD positive in 41% of 82 community-dwelling patients; an equivalent by history and/or prescription records, however, was detected in only 18% (p < 0.0001). In contrast, in 82 age- and gender-matched community-dwelling control patients, there was only a minor discrepancy (3%) in BZD use between anamnestic (N = 19) and analytical (N = 21) data. In 23 patients admitted from nursing homes, a similar trend was visible (39% serum positive for BZD vs 26% by drug history). Barbiturate use (N = 2) could be neglected, and TCA intake was minor (N = 7); in each case both assessments were in accordance. In conclusion, in patients with hip fracture, BZD use is substantially more frequent than reported and previously assumed, pointing to an underestimated risk factor for this injury.", 
    "150": "A 71-year-old woman with depression had been treated with an antidepressant (maprotiline) and antianxiety agents (clotiazepam and alprazolam). She had previously complained of ocular pain and blurred vision. However, thorough ocular examination was not performed at those times. On examination, visual acuity was no light perception OD and hand motion OS. Intraocular pressures were 33 mm Hg OU. Moderately dilated pupils, atrophic irises, shallow anterior chambers and closed angles were seen in both eyes. Despite treatment, her visual acuity decreased to no light perception bilaterally. Psychiatrists and ophthalmologists should be aware that antidepressants and antianxiety agents can precipitate angle closure glaucoma in susceptible eyes.", 
    "151": "This study investigated the effects of a benzodiazepine partial agonist, abecarnil, and a full agonist, alprazolam, on ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors in rats. Anxiety was assessed in two models: elevated plus maze and pentylenetetrazol (GABA(A) antagonist) discrimination assay. Male rats received an ethanol-containing (4.5%) liquid diet for 7 to 10 days and were tested for withdrawal symptoms 12 h after termination of the diet. In the elevated plus maze, ethanol-withdrawn rats displayed less open arm activity and total arm entries than pair-fed rats. Abecarnil (0.08-0.32 mg/kg, IP) and alprazolam (0.08-1.25 mg/kg, IP) each produced a dose-dependent, full reversal of ethanol withdrawal-induced reduction of open arm activity, but only alprazolam increased the total arm entries. In the pentylenetetrazol assay, ethanol-withdrawn rats selected the pentylenetetrazol lever (100%) over the salin-lever. Abecarnil (0.04-0.32 mg/kg, IP) and alprazolam (0.08-0.32 mg/kg, IP) dose dependently reduced pentylenetetrazol-lever responding to control levels (10-20%). Alprazolam was more potent than abecarnil in reversing ethanol withdrawal-induced decrease in open arm activities, but showed comparable potency and efficacy to abecarnil in blocking the pentylenetetrazol-like ethanol withdrawal stimulus. These results suggest that abecarnil and alprazolam may have therapeutic potential for treatment of ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like symptoms.", 
    "152": "Complete or partial spinal section at T(8) has been shown to block tactile allodynia but not thermal hyperalgesia following L(5)/L(6) spinal nerve ligation (SNL), suggesting the supraspinal integration of allodynia in neuropathic pain. In the present study, the possibility of mediation of nerve injury-associated pain through tonic activity of descending nociceptive facilitation arising from the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) was investigated. Specifically, the actions of brainstem cholecystokinin and the possible importance of sustained afferent input from injured nerve fibers were determined using pharmacological and physiological approaches in rats with SNL. Lidocaine given bilaterally into the RVM blocked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in SNL rats and was inactive in sham-operated rats. Bilateral injection of L365,260 (CCK(B) receptor antagonist) into the RVM also reversed both tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Microinjection of CCK-8 (s) into the RVM of naive rats produced a robust tactile allodynic effect and a more modest hyperalgesia. CCK immunoreactivity was not significantly different between SNL and sham-operated rats. The anti-nociceptive effect of morphine given into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray region (PAG) was substantially reduced by SNL. The injection of L365,260 into the RVM or of bupivacaine at the site of nerve injury restored the potency and efficacy of PAG morphine in SNL rats. These results suggest that changes in supraspinal processing are likely to contribute to the observed poor efficacy of opioids in clinical states of neuropathic pain. These data also indicate that the activation of descending nociceptive facilitatory pathways is important in the maintenance of neuropathic pain, appears to be dependent on CCK release, and may be driven from sustained afferent input from injured nerves to brainstem sites. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that abnormal tonic activity of descending facilitation mechanisms may underlie chronic pain from peripheral nerve injury.", 
    "153": "The role of AMPA receptors in cochlear synaptic transmission and excitotoxicity was investigated by comparing the actions of a selective AMPA antagonist GYKI 53784 (LY303070) with additional AMPA/kainate antagonists, GYKI 52466 and DNQX, and the NMDA antagonist, D-AP5, in several electrophysiological, neurotoxicological and histochemical tests. GYKI 53784 had the same potency as DNQX and was 10 times more potent than GYKI 52466 in reducing auditory nerve activity. The NMDA antagonist D-AP5 had no effect on auditory nerve activity. When single-fiber activity was blocked with GYKI 53784, the effects of AMPA or kainate were also antagonized. GYKI 53784 completely blocked excitotoxicity (i.e. destruction of the afferent nerve endings) induced by AMPA and kainate. The histochemical detection of Co(2+) uptake was used to study Ca(2+) influx within the primary auditory nerve cells. Application of AMPA induced no significant Co(2+) uptake into the cells, suggesting that these receptors normally have a very low permeability to Ca(2+). Application of kainate induced significant Co(2+) uptake that was blocked by the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 53784 suggesting that kainate stimulated Ca(2+) entry through AMPA receptor channels. Results suggest that AMPA-preferring receptors are functionally located at the sensory cell-afferent synapse whereas NMDA and kainate receptors are not."
