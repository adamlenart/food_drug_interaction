Data were obtained from computerized files from the Tennessee Medicaid program, driver's license files, and police reports of injurious crashes. Cohort members were Medicaid enrollees 65-84 years of age who had a valid driver's license during the study period 1984-1988 and who met other criteria designed to exclude persons unlikely to be drivers and to ensure availability of necessary study data. There were 16,262 persons in the study cohort with 38,701 person-years of follow-up and involvement in 495 injurious crashes. For four groups of psychoactive drugs (benzodiazepines, cyclic antidepressants, oral opioid analgesics, and antihistamines), the risk of crash involvement was calculated with Poisson regression models that controlled for demographic characteristics and use of medical care as an indicator of health status. The relative risk of injurious crash involvement for current users of any psychoactive drug was 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.9). This increased risk was confined to benzodiazepines (relative risk = 1.5; 95% CI 1.2-1.9) and cyclic antidepressants (relative risk = 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-3.5). For these drugs, the relative risk increased with dose and was substantial for high doses: 2.4 (95% CI 1.3-4.4) for > or = 20 mg of diazepam and 5.5 (95% CI 2.6-11.6) for > or = 125 mg of amitriptyline. Analysis of data for the crash-involved drivers suggested that these findings were not due to confounding by alcohol use or driving frequency.", 
    "1": "Enhancement of brain dopamine (DA) activity is believed to be an important mechanism underlying the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine in animals and the subjective effects of cocaine in people. Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, which are colocalized with DA receptors in several brain regions, have been implicated as modulators of DA activity, leading to speculation that CCK-based drugs might be developed as therapeutics for cocaine abuse. In the present study, the effects of cocaine alone and after pretreatment with the selective CCKA antagonist devazepide and the selective CCKB antagonist CI 988 were determined in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine (1.0 mg/kg) from saline. When tested alone, cocaine engendered dose-related increases in the percentage of cocaine-appropriate responses, reaching virtually exclusive responding on the cocaine-associated lever after doses of 1.0 mg/kg or greater. Pretreatment with a wide range of doses of either devazepide (0.01-3.0 mg/kg) or CI 988 (0.3-30 mg/kg) did not systematically alter the discriminative stimulus effects of any dose of cocaine. The results do not support a role for CCK antagonists in the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse.", 
    "2": "The reinforcing effects of diazepam (DZP) were compared under two conditions in human volunteers using a cumulative dose procedure. Under the social (SOC) condition, groups of two to four subjects participated concurrently whereas in the solitary (SOL) condition subjects participated individually. During the first four sessions of each condition, subjects received 20 mg DZP in five divided doses (4 mg) in two of the sessions and placebo (PL) in the other two sessions. Each drug (DZP or PL) was administered in a distinctively colored capsule and labeled by letter code. During the last three choice sessions, subjects chose which capsule they wished to self-administer and were allowed to choose up to a maximum of seven capsules (28 mg DZP) during each session. Subjects also filled out questionnaires that assessed momentary mood. Overall, DZP was chosen on 33% of choice sessions and there were no differences across conditions. There was a tendency for choice to be correlated with levels of weekly alcohol consumption and liking scores, and as well the latter two measures were correlated. DZP produced sedative-like subjective effects that did not appear to be related to setting, choice of drug in the study, or alcohol drinking history. These results partially confirm previous reports of a relationship between DZP preference and alcohol consumption, but differ from previously reported studies in the overall lower level of DZP choice.", 
    "3": "The effects of lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala on anxiety-like behaviors in the rat were determined using two animal models, the conditioned suppression of drinking (CSD) and defensive burying paradigms. For CSD conflict testing, water-restricted rats were trained to drink water from a tube that was occasionally electrified (0.25 mA); electrification was signaled by a tone. CSD test sessions were 10 min in duration and were conducted 4 days per week. After at least 3 weeks of conflict testing, both punished (30-40 shocks per session) and unpunished (10-12 ml water per session) responding had stabilized. Subjects then received bilateral electrolytic lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala or sham lesions. After a 1-week recovery period, CSD conflict testing was reinstated and continued for 20 weeks. Amygdaloid-lesioned subjects accepted significantly more shocks than did sham controls. In addition, acute challenges with the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg/kg, IP, 30-min pretreatment), the barbiturate phenobarbital (20 mg/kg, IP, 10-min pretreatment), and carbamazepine (10 mg/kg, IP, 10-min pretreatment) produced an increase in punished responding in both amygdaloid-lesioned and sham-treated subjects. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)-based adjusted means for the change in shocks received were not significantly different between the two groups. Following completion of the CSD studies, subjects were tested in the defensive burying paradigm. Although there was no significant difference between lesioned and sham-treated subjects on the percent of animals that exhibited burying, subjects with lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala exhibited a significantly greater latency to initiate defensive burying.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate physical dependence upon diazepam systematically in two inbred strains of rats, Lewis (LEW) and Fischer 344 (F344). Rats were chronically fed food containing diazepam on an escalating drug dosage schedule, from 1 and 2 to 12 mg/g of food, over a period of 30 days. During treatment, the growth curve in LEW and F344 rats was suppressed compared with the respective controls. Motor incoordination was evaluated by a rotarod performance test. The ranking of the motor incoordination during the final concentration of diazepam was as follows: F344 greater than LEW. After substitution of normal food for the diazepam-admixed food, various signs of diazepam withdrawal occurred 16-120 h later. These signs included vocalization, irritability, muscle rigidity, ear-twitching, Straub's tail, piloerection, fascicular twitch, tremor, convulsion, and death. The incidences of vocalization, ear-twitching, piloerection, and tremor in F344 were significantly higher than those in LEW rats. Furthermore, two of six F344 rats showed spontaneous convulsions and one rat died of convulsions. Overall withdrawal scores were significantly greater in F344 (16.0) than in LEW (6.3) rats. These results suggest that diazepam withdrawal severity is strongly influenced by genetic factors, and F344 rats are highly susceptible to dependence upon benzodiazepines.", 
    "5": "Learned helplessness (LH) is prevented by pretreatment with acute benzodiazepines (BDZs), subchronic tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), or escapable stress (ES). We have investigated the role of serotonin (5-HT) in LH prevention by these three prevention paradigms, using microdialysis to measure in vivo 5-HT release in frontal cortex (FC) after LH testing. Rats receiving pretreatment before inescapable stress with any of the three methods of prevention--BDZs, TCAs, or ES--showed escape behavior in the shuttle-box test for LH comparable to naive unstressed controls. K(+)-stimulated 5-HT release in all three groups receiving pretreatment was also similar to naive unstressed controls. Rats receiving saline before inescapable stress showed significantly more LH behavior in the shuttle-box task and had significantly lower 5-HT release as well. This suggests that LH correlates with a significant decrease in intracellular releasable 5-HT in FC, and that three different techniques for LH prevention, acute BDZs, subchronic TCAs, and ES all similarly prevent this 5-HT depletion.", 
    "6": "Brain cholecystokinin (CCK)- and noradrenergic activities are two neurochemical systems implicated in anxiety and deficits in novelty-related behaviour. In order to clarify a possible interaction between CCK- and noradrenergic neurotransmission in the brain, DSP-4 [N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine], a neurotoxin that selectively destroys noradrenaline-containing nerve terminals originating from the locus coeruleus, was administered to rats IP (10 and 50 mg/kg) seven days before decapitation. Noradrenaline uptake was very markedly reduced in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the DSP-4 treated animals, whereas the decrease in the hypothalamus was smaller but still statistically significant. Dopamine uptake in the corpus striatum, as well as serotonin uptake in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, were not influenced by DSP-4 treatment. Concomitantly, CCK receptor binding in certain brain regions was markedly affected. Thus, CCK receptor density was significantly higher in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of DSP-4-treated rats. If desipramine (25 mg/kg) was administered before DSP-4 treatment, the DSP-4-induced changes both in noradrenaline uptake and CCK receptor binding were not present, suggesting that both effects were exerted after uptake of the neurotoxin by the nerve terminals. The time-course of the development of changes in CCK-8 binding paralleled with some lag the development of changes in noradrenaline uptake. These findings demonstrate the denervation of noradrenergic input from the locus coeruleus induces certain alterations in the CCKergic neurotransmission. These alterations are similar to those seen in rats with deficits in response to novel stimuli, and may therefore mediate the neophobic responses observed in animals after lesions of noradrenergic innervation of the forebrain.", 
    "7": "The effects of pirenzepine on blood pressure, heart rate and gastric juice volume as well as pH were evaluated and compared with those after atropine and cimetidine in 54 adult patients divided into five groups. Patients in Groups A, P, AP, AC and ACP received atropine, pirenzepine, atropine plus pirenzepine, atropine plus cimetidine, or atropine, cimetidine plus pirenzepine, respectively. Atropine 0.5 mg and cimetidine 200 mg were given intramuscularly 60 min before induction of anesthesia, and pirenzepine 10 mg was given intravenously 5 min before induction. Gastric juice was aspirated just after, 60 and 120 min after induction of anesthesia. Mean blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged following intravenous pirenzepine in Group P, whereas heart rate increased significantly in Groups AP and ACP. There were no significant differences in mean volume and pH of gastric juice among the groups just after and 120 min after induction of anesthesia, although gastric volume in Group AC was significantly less than in Groups P, AP and ACP 60 min after induction. Gastric pH increased gradually and gastric volume decreased slightly following intravenous pirenzepine. The incidence of samples with a pH higher than 2.5 was greater in Group AC than in Group P just after and 60 min after induction, whereas there was no difference between the two groups after 120 min. We conclude that intravenous pirenzepine 10 mg is effective to reduce gastric juice volume and acidity, and it should be given at least 60 min before induction of anesthesia.", 
    "8": "Substance abuse in the spinal cord injured (SCI) population has been addressed in a few controlled studies. These reports have led to the belief that many SCI patients were illicit drug users prior to their injury and that their drug abuse was a contributing cause of their accidents. One large study determined from answers obtained on a questionnaire that drug abuse, other than alcohol, was prevalent among injured veterans. Our study uses urine toxicology to determine the frequency of drug use and abuse, excluding alcohol, in 72 inpatients and 81 outpatients associated with an urban Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In a blinded experiment, urinary concentrations of opiates, barbiturates, amphetamines, methadone, benzodiazepines, and cocaine were determined with Syva reagents on an Abbott VP. Urinary cannabinoids were determined using Abbott TDX and the FPIA method. The use of illicit (unprescribed) drugs was surprisingly low (< or = 13 percent) for an urban medical center. Outpatient cannabinoid abuse was significantly more frequent than inpatient usage (p < 0.01). Barbiturates were not found in any patient. Benzodiazepines were taken most commonly (29 percent). Since benzodiazepine usage is the direct result of physician prescription, wide-spread usage of this agent is avoidable. Physicians should pay attention to the probable deleterious consequences of benzodiazepine addiction related to depressive effects on the central nervous system caused by its chronic use.", 
    "9": "1. The cardiac cholinergic blockade and the chronotropic effect of the widely differing antimuscarinic drugs atropine and pirenzepine were investigated in the dog. 2. In conscious dogs, suppression of the parasympathetic system with atropine (0.2 mg kg-1 h-1) causes marked brief cardioacceleration (234 +/- 13 beats min-1) while pirenzepine (3 mg kg-1 h-1) causes moderate but persistent cardioacceleration (179 +/- 13 beats min-1). After suppression of the influence of the cardiac sympathetic system these cardioaccelerator effects are attenuated, particularly those of pirenzepine. 3. The effects of vagal stimulation are blocked completely and persistently by both agents. 4. When the cardioinhibitory action of the vagus nerve is blocked by pirenzepine the induced tachycardia can be increased by atropine, which causes an additional cardioacceleration (25 +/- 9 beats min-1). 5. These results show that the tachycardia induced by antimuscarinic agents is not only due to vagal blockade. The different mechanisms which may be involved are discussed. The results suggest that pirenzepine can suppress cholinergic influence on the heart more electively than atropine, which induced an 'excess tachycardia'. Also, intrinsic heart rate can be approached more closely when pirenzepine is used to suppress the parasympathetic system, than with atropine.", 
    "10": "Patients with recurrent pathologic aggressive behavior constitute a severe problem for psychiatric institutions. Besides of being dangerous towards others, these patients themselves suffer from a variety of negative consequences, such as the danger of long-term hospitalisation etc. Therefore, pharmacologic treatment in addition to psychotherapeutic and social interventions is not only ethically justified but mostly inevitable. This kind of combined treatment as a rather common procedure in psychiatric institutions leads time and again to fairly high doses of neuroleptics but not to satisfactory results. This article gives an overview of studies on the advantages and drawbacks of alternative substances: Benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, lithium salts, amine precursors and antiepileptics. Differential indications are described.", 
    "11": "Saccadic eye movements were analyzed after single oral doses of 20 mg temazepam and placebo in a randomized, double-blind crossover study in eight healthy volunteers. For an optimal evaluation of concentration-effect relationships, 18 blood samples and 43 effect measures were obtained over 33 1/2 hours. After placebo, saccadic peak velocity decreased within the first hour, with average values remaining 6.2% to 12.1% below baseline up to 15 hours after intake. After temazepam, significant changes in peak velocity occurred for 5 hours, with maximum decreases averaging 29.2% (95% confidence interval, 10.0 to 37.2). The apparent duration of effects ranged from 3 to 9 hours in individual subjects. Linear concentration-effect relationships were demonstrated for peak velocity, with individual slopes ranging from -0.11 to -0.46 deg/sec.(ng/ml)-1 (average r = -0.82, all p < 0.01). Differences in protein binding of temazepam did not account for the approximate fourfold variability in individual sensitivities to temazepam. By increasing the frequency of measurements, the accuracy of pharmacodynamic evaluations was clearly enhanced in this study.", 
    "12": "It is well recognized that many injecting drug users are poly-drug users. The intravenous use of Temazepam has become popular recently. In response to the ease of misuse, the pharmaceutical industry produced a formulation that would be as 'resistant' as possible to injecting. The preparation is a gel-filled formulation, one proprietary name being Temazepam Gelthix. General Practitioners have been encouraged to prescribe gel-filled capsules to potential drug misusers in order to reduce the harm Temazepam can cause by its misuse. This study of 23 Temazepam injectors shows that the group still find the gel-filled preparation readily injectable. It appears to be more problematic in causing medical complications including superficial thrombophlebitis, abscesses and deep venous thrombosis. Temazepam misuse can cause drug users to become more chaotic. The study group recognize this and suggest there should be stricter control on the supply of Temazepam to drug dependents. General Practitioners, who are the main source of Temazepam prescribing, require additional training in prescribing to drug users.", 
    "13": "The cholecystokinin (CCK) peptide family is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including neurotransmission in the brain. Pharmacological responses to CCK are mediated through at least two receptor subtypes termed CCK-A and CCK-B. Studies with CCK agonists suggest a possible role for CCK in cognition. Using selective antagonists and a behavioural recognition test based on the olfactory discriminative capacities of rats, we found that endogenous CCK acting at CCK-A and CCK-B receptors modulates olfactory recognition positively and negatively, respectively. CCK-B receptor antagonists therefore have facilitatory potentialities on memory processes.", 
    "14": "Acetylcholine, acting on muscarinic receptors, has a powerful modulatory effect on neurons in the cerebral cortex. Recent evidence that cortical tissue contains at least four different muscarinic receptor subtypes having different pharmacological properties indicates the value of new investigations of the receptor subtypes that mediate electrophysiological responses. Here we studied the ionic nature and pharmacology of the depolarizing response to acetylcholine in identified corticocallosal neurons in primary culture. This response is the result of a non-rectifying 'leak' K+ conductance which is reduced in the presence of acetylcholine. The relative sensitivity of this conductance change to the antagonists pirenzepine and 4-DAMP suggests that it is mediated by the M3 subtype of muscarinic receptor.", 
    "15": "The combination of a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and a muscarinic receptor antagonist has been reported to result in greater suppression of intragastric acidity than either agent alone. The present randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial compared the effects of the oral combination of 150 mg ranitidine b.d. plus 50 mg pirenzepine b.d. with 150 mg ranitidine b.d. plus placebo pirenzepine b.d. in the treatment of patients with reflux oesophagitis. All 157 patients had symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux with endoscopically confirmed oesophageal erosions (Savary and Miller grades I-III). After four weeks of treatment, healing rates were 32/75 (43%) in the combined treatment group and 34/76 (45%) in the group receiving ranitidine alone. After eight weeks, the cumulative healing rates had increased to 48/72 (67%) and 51/75 (68%), respectively. More patients receiving ranitidine plus pirenzepine had complete relief of day- and night-time heartburn after four weeks compared with those receiving ranitidine alone (day: 59% vs. 38%, P = 0.02; night: 69% vs. 52%, P = 0.04). After eight weeks, symptom relief was comparable in both groups. Clinical adverse effects were reported by nine patients receiving ranitidine and by 19 patients receiving the combination. It is concluded that combining ranitidine with pirenzepine does not aid the healing of reflux oesophagitis but does improve symptom relief at four weeks.", 
    "16": "Anterior segment ophthalmic surgery is commonly performed under local anaesthesia. In order to improve patient comfort, a variety of sedation techniques has been employed in the past. The object of this study was, firstly, to determine whether continuous intravenous sedation during surgery offered any advantages in patients premedicated with temazepam and metoclopramide, and, secondly, to compare midazolam to propofol for this purpose. Forty nine patients were randomly allocated to receive no intravenous sedation (n = 15), continuous propofol infusion (n = 17), or continuous intravenous midazolam infusion (n = 17) after peribulbar anaesthesia. Each technique provided cardiovascular and respiratory stability and allowed early recovery with minimal postoperative sequelae. Unexpected ocular field movement occurred more commonly in the patients receiving intravenous sedation, although statistical significance was not shown (p = 0.06). Significantly more patients in the intravenous sedation groups reported amnesia (p = 0.03). Patient acceptability was good irrespective of the technique used. This study suggests that continuous sedation using propofol or midazolam is not beneficial and should be avoided in ophthalmic patients who have received a simple premedication.", 
    "17": "Two different stimuli (i.e., benzodiazepines and dark pulses) inducing phase shifts in the circadian clock of young hamsters through changes in the level of activity do not induce phase shifts in old hamsters, despite the fact that these stimuli induce a similar acute change in locomotor activity in young and old animals. In contrast, old hamsters remain sensitive to the phase-shifting effects of stimuli clearly not associated with any change in locomotor activity (i.e., protein synthesis inhibitors or light). Thus the circadian system of old animals becomes selectively unresponsive to synchronizing signals mediated by the activity-rest state of the animals. Previous age-related changes in circadian rhythmicity that have been observed in mammals, including humans, may be related to a weakened coupling between the activity-rest cycle and the circadian clock.", 
    "18": "Management of trigeminal neuralgia, a severe facial pain, remains difficult. All patients are initially treated with drugs. Since the seventeenth century more than 40 different preparations have been used; some of these, although effective, had toxic side effects. The most useful drugs at present are carbamazepine, phenytoin, baclofen, and clonazepam. A new drug, oxcarbazepine, is showing therapeutic promise. The most common reason for therapeutic failure with antineuralgic drugs is inadequate dosage. We review here the pharmacokinetics, side effects, possible drug interactions, plasma and serum therapeutic concentrations, and the available formulations of each drug. On the basis of these considerations and clinical reports describing the use of these drugs, we make dosage recommendations to enable the practitioner to individualize therapeutic regimens.", 
    "19": "Zolpidem is a new, short-acting hypnotic of imidazopyridine structure which binds selectively to a subpopulation of receptors involved in the action of benzodiazepines [omega 1 (BZ1) sites of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors]. The present study investigated whether tolerance and physical dependence develop after repeated treatment with zolpidem as is observed with benzodiazepines. Mice were given zolpidem or the benzodiazepine midazolam (2 x 30 mg/kg, p.o.) for 10 consecutive days. Tolerance to central depressant effects (evaluated by recording spontaneous locomotor activity) and to anticonvulsant effects (measured against pentylenetetrazole-, electroshock- and isoniazid-induced convulsions) was assessed 42 hr after the last administration. A decrease in the latency to isoniazid-induced convulsions was taken as an index of physical dependence and was evaluated 3, 6, 14, 24, 42 and 67 hr after the end of chronic drug treatment. Repeated treatment with midazolam produced tolerance to its sedative and anticonvulsant activities as indicated by shifts of the dose-response curves by a factor of 3 to 5. Fourteen hr after discontinuation of treatment, spontaneous withdrawal was observed and lasted 3 days. When flumazenil was given 3 or 6 hr after the final midazolam injection, precipitated withdrawal was observed. In contrast, after repeated treatment with zolpidem, there was no change in its ability to produce sedative and anticonvulsant effects. Moreover, neither spontaneous nor flumazenil-induced precipitated withdrawal was observed in zolpidem-treated mice.", 
    "20": "Separate episodes of both catatonia and the so-called 'neuroleptic malignant syndrome' (NMS) occurred within the same patient. The only evidence for NMS in this case was prior administration of a neuroleptic and the presence of generalised muscular rigidity. It is suggested that it is misleading to view these conditions as separate diagnostic entities and that NMS is probably more correctly incorporated into the catatonic disorders.", 
    "21": "Opiates remain the mainstay of cancer pain treatment, used in a logical and stepwise fashion with adjunctive therapies as needed. Certain neuropsychotropic drugs may enhance the analgesia produced by opiates and may occasionally be used in place of opiates. Some of these drugs may also provide additional psychoactive benefits. The types of neuropsychotropic drugs that may be useful in treating cancer pain include the tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, neuroleptics, antihistamines, psychostimulants, and benzodiazepines, as well as systemic local anesthetics. This article reviews the general principles of using adjunctive medications to achieve maximal analgesic benefit with the least number of side effects, and describes each class of neuropsychotropic drug, their proposed mechanism of analgesia, and appropriate use in cancer patients.", 
    "22": "Using a competitive polymerase chain reaction assay, we have quantitated the absolute amounts of mRNA encoding 14 distinct subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons and cerebellar astrocytes. We found that the total amount of GABAA receptor subunit mRNA in astrocytes was 2 orders of magnitude lower than in neuronal cells. Furthermore, granule cell cultures expressed all 14 different GABAA subunit mRNAs, while the astroglial cultures contained detectable amounts of all the subunits expressed by granule cells except the alpha 6 and the gamma 2L subunits. Of the alpha subunit family members, the alpha 1, alpha 5, and alpha 6 mRNAs were prominent in granule cells, while the alpha 1 and alpha 2 mRNAs were abundant in astrocytes. Of the beta receptor subunit mRNAs, the beta 1 and beta 3 mRNAs were abundantly expressed in both cultures. The gamma 2S and gamma 2L mRNAs constituted the great majority of gamma subunit mRNAs in neurons, while the gamma 1 subunit mRNA was the most abundant gamma subunit mRNA in astrocytes. When various allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors were tested electrophysiologically, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline- 3-carboxylate (DMCM) was the only one to modulate chloride currents elicited by GABA in a significantly different manner in granule cells (negative modulation) compared with astrocytes (positive modulation). The latter effect was previously observed in transiently expressed recombinant GABAA receptors containing a gamma 1 instead of a gamma 2 subunit. Our quantitative mRNA results suggest that an important molecular determinant responsible for the DMCM-positive modulatory effect on astroglial native GABAA receptors is the presence of the gamma 1 subunit in the receptor assembly.", 
    "23": "The resolution of four racemic 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones, widely used in therapeutics, by means of a chiral stationary phase is described. The chiral selector used is (S)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylalanine. This chiral stationary phase showed both good enantioselectivity and efficiency for the compounds. Elution times were in all cases shorter than those previously reported for such compounds on different stationary phases. Racemic oxazepam was used to evaluate the loading capacity of the chiral stationary phase.", 
    "24": "The retention behaviour of various benzodiazepine derivatives was investigated on silica gel layers impregnated with tricaprylmethylammonium chloride (TCMA). The chromatograms were developed by means of overpressured layer chromatography (OPLC). As for the case of amino- and nitrosalicylic acids, pyrimidine derivatives, barbiturates, penicillins, cephalosporins and tetracyclines, the retention of benzodiazepine derivatives increased with increasing layer TCMA concentration with eluents containing methanol and water, but not TCMA. On increase of the methanol content of the eluent, a retention-decreasing effect was observed. On layers impregnated with TCMA, a linear relationship existed between the RM values of the benzodiazepines and the methanol content of the eluent. A similar relationship held for silica gel layers impregnated with paraffin oil (traditional reversed-phase). There was no correlation between the results obtained on layers treated with TCMA or with paraffin oil. On TCMA-impregnated layers, the retention of compounds having different chemical structures showed no dependence on the pH of the eluent. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, as it was established, above a certain RF value, the pH of the layer in the presence of TCMA was almost identical irrespective of the original pH of the buffer. Secondly, below this RF value, the actual pH of the layer did not have a strong enough effect to cause appreciable differences between the retentions of the dissociated and undissociated species of the analytes. The conditions for optimum separation are given.", 
    "25": "Cocaine abuse is common among parturients with an incidence of 11.8 to 20%. Myocardial infarction is a rare and lethal event during pregnancy with an incidence of 1 in 10,000 pregnancies. We present the anaesthetic management of a parturient of 36 wk gestation who suffered a myocardial infarction nine hours before delivery which was temporally related to \"crack\" cocaine use. The patient's cardiovascular system became unstable following cocaine use, and she required mechanical ventilatory support and pharmacologic stabilization guided by invasive haemodynamic monitoring. This patient survived a non-Q wave myocardial infarction, but the prognosis of peripartum myocardial infarction remains poor with a mortality rate of 30-40% which is increased if the infarction occurs in the third trimester or postpartum period. The optimal mode and timing of delivery after myocardial infarction is unresolved. The association between cocaine use and myocardial infarction was first described in 1982, and cocaine remains unique among local anaesthetics in its ability to compromise the cardiovascular system through both sympathomimetic effects and vasoconstrictive effects on coronary arteries. Because of the prevalence of substance abuse, cocaine use should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiovascular compromise in parturients.", 
    "26": "In acute myocardial infarction a third up to half of death registered within the first month occur in the first hour of the onset of attack most frequently because of ventricular fibrillation. Immediate self administration of drugs stabilizing electrically the heart may prevent it. On the basis of experiments in dogs and in rats flunitrazepam (Rohypnol tabl. 1 mg), tramadol (Tramal caps. 50 mg) and the beta blocker metipranolol (Trimepranol tabl. 10 mg) were selected for clinical trial on high risk patients. As the chosen combinations of drugs were not yet tested in view of possible interactions, we studied their effect on circulation and cardiovascular reflexes in eight healthy volunteers. When the drugs were absorbed from the mouth mucosa, the decrease in the heart rate during deep breathing was observed already 15 minutes after the intake of drugs. The subjects started to feel relaxed; later on they had pleasant feelings and felt sleepy. There were no undesirable changes in the heart rate or blood pressure. In the three drug combination with metripranolol, the decrease in the heart rate was more marked. The tests in volunteers were without any undesirable effects and both combinations may, therefore, be given to selected high risk subjects, e g. convalescents from myocardial infarction. Randomized trial to prove the preventive effect already started.",

    "28": "Tandospirone is an azaspirodecanedione derivative under investigation as an antidepressant. Metabolism of tandospirone in humans and rodents leads to 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP), presumed to have pharmacologic activity. To determine the relative contributions of tandospirone and 1-PP after tandospirone administration, we evaluated open-field activity, pharmacokinetics, and receptor binding of tandospirone and 1-PP in a mouse model. Tandospirone significantly reduced open-field activity during 30 minutes at doses of 1-20 mg/kg. 1-PP had no significant effect on activity except for a trend toward reduction at 20 mg/kg. At 30 minutes after administration, plasma and cortex concentrations of tandospirone and 1-PP increased in proportion to dose. Plasma protein binding (free fraction) for tandospirone was 30.4%, and for 1-PP, 87.5%. Receptor binding studies indicated that tandospirone bound with high affinity to serotonin1A sites, and with low affinity to serotonin2, alpha 1, alpha 2, and benzodiazepine sites. 1-PP bound with high affinity to alpha 2 sites and with low affinity to the other sites evaluated. A \"receptor occupancy index\" of tandospirone cortex concentrations divided by receptor affinity suggests that after acute administration of tandospirone, effects are likely to be due to the parent compound rather than to the metabolite.

Eighty-one (20%) samples were positive for alcohol; BZD were detected in 34 (8.5%) cases. Ten of the samples (2.5%) were found to be positive for both alcohol and BZD. Subjects who were positive for either alcohol or BZD or both were older than the other persons examined. The prevalence of alcohol was significantly higher among male accident victims. BZD intake could be demonstrated to have a significant influence on the severity of injuries. Besides an increased awareness of the need for skier education regarding drug use, heightened attention of medical caregivers is warranted to inform their patients about potential accident hazards in sport activities when BZD are prescribed.", 
    "30": "There are presently three main treatments for restless leg syndrome-periodic leg movements in sleep (RLS-PLMS). The benzodiazepines (especially clonazepam) are considered by most clinicians to be the treatment of choice in mild cases, especially in young subjects. In our experience, however, L-dopa and bromocriptine are more effective treatments, although no controlled studies have ever been conducted to compare their therapeutic benefits and the side effects of benzodiazepines and dopaminergic drugs. The use of opioids should be restricted to patients who have severe symptoms and who fail to respond to benzodiazepines or L-dopa. Propoxyphene was found less effective than L-dopa in decreasing PLMS, but some patients resistant to L-dopa may exhibit a masked therapeutic response to opioids. However, there is currently no method to predict the response to any treatment modality.", 
    "31": "The \"discovery\" of alpha 2-receptors permits the explanation of the mechanism of xylazine that was hitherto poorly understood. The substance can be classified as an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. In the near future two new alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists will be available in Germany: medetomidine for small animals and detomidine for large animals. Also a new alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist will be introduced: atipamezole. alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists cause sedation, analgesia and muscle relaxation. Notable side effects are bradycardia, heart block and a dose dependent respiratory depression. A comprehensive survey on the pharmacology of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists is given. The previous literature is summarized and discussed, including own studies and clinical experience. An attempt is made to assess the clinical importance of the new drugs. For certain indications medetomidine alone may not be satisfying and combination with other drugs becomes necessary. If sedation is inadequate, the combination with benzodiazepines or propofol is advised; if analgesia is poor, the combination with ketamine or an opioid is recommended.", 
    "32": "Rats were trained to discriminate the low-efficacy benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist RU 33965 from vehicle in a two-lever discrimination task on a fixed ratio (FR) 20 schedule. Consistent discrimination was obtained at 0.5 mg/kg PO RU 33965. Both leptazol and stronger inverse agonists (FG7142, S-135, RU 34000) substituted for the cue. The weak inverse agonists/antagonists RU 33094, RU 34030, Ro 15-1788, and ZK 93426 also substituted for the cue with the latter two compounds being particularly potent. The agonist and partial agonists diazepam, RU 33203, and RU 39419 did not substitute for the RU 33965 cue but RU 39419 antagonised it. The full agonists diazepam and loprazolam only consistently antagonised the cue when given IP 5 min pretest. These data suggest that the RU 33965 cue results from its weak inverse agonist activity at benzodiazepine receptors, but kinetic factors must be considered when interpreting drug effects in discrimination studies.", 
    "33": "tau-Vinyl GABA (vigabatrin, GVG) is a novel antiepileptic drug that irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase and elevates GABA levels in all parts of the brain. In the present study, we investigated the anxiolytic and behavioral effects of GVG in the elevated plus-maze and the hole board compared to diazepam. Doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/kg GVG were injected IP to different groups of male Wistar rats and animals were tested either 4 or 24 h after injection. Animals administered diazepam (1.5 mg/kg, IP) and saline (1 ml) were tested 20 min after injection. GVG and diazepam were found to decrease significantly the number of squares visited and rearing; both had a suppressant effect on locomotor activity. Neither drug had an effect on exploration (head dipping). GVG at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg was shown to have a similar anxiolytic activity either after 4 or 24 h as diazepam, while GVG at 500 mg/kg did not show any significant anxiolytic effect.", 
    "34": "d-AP159 is a d-optical isomer, and in rats it has a high affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors and potent anticonflict activity, equal to that of buspirone. The anticonflict effects of d-AP159 and buspirone were investigated in animals in which lesions of the serotonergic neurons were caused by intradorsal raphe (d-RA) injection of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). The anticonflict effect of buspirone, but not that of d-AP159, was attenuated in 5-HT neuron-lesioned rats. The anticonflict effect of d-AP159 injected into various brain sites was also studied. d-AP159 and buspirone microinjected into the d-RA caused significant anticonflict activity in rats. There was a significant anticonflict effect of d-AP159 injected into the amygdala centralis (ACE), but not the dorsal hippocampus (d-HC). The anticonflict effect of d-AP159 injected into the d-RA was antagonized by systemic administration of (-)propranolol but not Ro 15-1788. This effect of d-AP159 injected into the ACE was antagonized by systematic administration of Ro 15-1788 but not (-)propranolol. These results suggest that the d-RA and the ACE play important roles in the anticonflict effects of d-AP159 but that the mechanisms by which this drug acts at these sites are different.", 
    "35": "The general purpose of the present study was to analyze the possible interactions between the GABA-benzodiazepine and the serotonergic (5-HT) systems in the anxiolytic action of diazepam and the 5-HT1A agonists, ipsapirone, indorenate, and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). The effect of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg), on the anxiolytic action of ipsapirone (5.0 mg/kg), indorenate (5.0 mg/kg), and 8-OH-DPAT (0.125 mg/kg) was examined on the avoidance exploratory behavior paradigm in mice. The effect of the 5-HT1 blockers, methiotepin (0.31 mg/kg), pindolol (3.1 mg/kg), and alprenolol (5.0 mg/kg), on the anxiolytic action of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) was also studied. In the last part of this work, the putative potentiation between diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) and each of the serotonergic anxiolytics was investigated. The antianxiety effect of diazepam, ipsapirone, indorenate, and 8-OH-DPAT was prevented by flumazenil. The serotonergic/beta-blocker, alprenolol, partially antagonized the diazepam effect. Finally, a potentiation of suboptimal doses of diazepam and ipsapirone, but not with indorenate or 8-OH-DPAT, was observed. The findings suggest an interaction between both systems on the anxiolytic action of diazepam and the 5-HT1A agonists.", 
    "36": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) hypnotics bind at a specific receptor located on postsynaptic neurons. Some data support specificity of binding for several hypnotics to receptor subtypes. We evaluated BDZ receptor binding in cerebral cortical membranes using agonist, antagonist, and subtype-specific ligands for commonly used hypnotics and their metabolites. All hypnotics competed similarly at BDZ1 and BDZ2 receptor subtypes except quazepam and its metabolite 2-oxo-quazepam and to a lesser extent hydroxyethyl flurazepam (EtOH) flurazepam. These compounds had relative specificity for the BDZ1 site. Triazolam, estazolam, and flurazepam bound equally to sites labeled by agonists and antagonists but desalkylflurazepam, EtOH flurazepam, temazepam, quazepam, and 2-oxo-quazepam did not; in addition, these four compounds did not bind to the \"peripheral\" BDZ site labeled by Ro 5-4864. BDZ hypnotics differ in their receptor subtype and ligand binding characteristics.", 
    "37": "This paper examines the prevalence of benzodiazepine use, and its relationship to other drug use and HIV risk-taking among a sample of 1245 injecting drug users (IDU). Approximately a third (36.6%) of the sample had used benzodiazepines during their last typical month of injecting. Benzodiazepine users had injected more frequently, injected more heroin and amphetamines, and had more poly-drug use than other IDU. They also had higher levels of HIV risk-taking, having shared injecting equipment more frequently and with more people. There were no differences between groups in number of sexual partners or condom use, although benzodiazepine users were more likely to have been paid for sex. The demographic and drug use variables indicate that benzodiazepine users are a more dysfunctional subgroup of IDU who require particular attention in HIV interventions.", 
    "38": "The angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DUP 753 (Losartan), was compared with diazepam for antianxiety properties in the rat using the elevated plus-maze. Oral diazepam (5 mg kg-1) resulted in a significantly greater number of entries of rats into the open arms of the maze, an increase in time spent in the open arms and a decreased time spent in the closed arms. Oral doses of DUP 753 likewise resulted in significantly greater numbers of entries into the open arms (active at 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg-1), increased time spent on the open arms (active at 0.0001-0.01 mg kg-1) and a decreased time spent in the closed arms (active at 0.0001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg-1). Larger (1.0 mg kg-1) or smaller (0.00001 mg kg-1) doses of DUP 753 were not active.", 
    "39": "Benzodiazepines, shown to affect memory, can produce anterograde amnesia (i.e., a loss of memory for events occurring forward in time). Following the ingestion of a benzodiazepine, short-term memory is not affected, but long-term memory is impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. Information stored prior to the ingestion of a benzodiazepine is not affected. Memory impairment is more likely in benzodiazepines that have a high benzodiazepine-receptor affinity, that accumulate in the body, that are given in high doses or intravenously, or that are eliminated slowly. Individuals taking benzodiazepines are often unaware of their memory impairment unless it is pointed out to them. Elderly clients experiencing memory impairment may be embarrassed to mention the problem. Alternatives to prescribing benzodiazepines include antidepressant medications, exercise or psychotherapy. When prescribing a benzodiazepine, it is important to fully inform patients of the drug's potential side effects and to maintain the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time.", 
    "40": "Extensive neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and behavioral evidence demonstrates that GABAergic neurons inhibit endogenous dopamine release in the mammalian corpus striatum. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in adult female baboons, using the dopamine D2-specific radiotracer 11C-raclopride, were undertaken to assess the utility of this imaging technique for measuring these dynamic interactions in vivo. 11C-raclopride binding was imaged prior to and following the administration of either gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG), a specific suicide inhibitor of the GABA-catabolizing enzyme GABA transaminase, or lorazepam, a clinically prescribed benzodiazepine agonist. Striatal 11C-raclopride binding increased following both GVG and lorazepam administration. This increase exceeded the test/retest variability of 11C-raclopride binding observed in the same animals. These findings confirm that changes in endogenous dopamine concentrations resulting from drug-induced potentiation of GABAergic transmission can be measured with PET and 11C-raclopride. Finally, this new strategy for noninvasively evaluating the functional integrity of neurophysiologically linked transmitter systems with PET supports its use as an approach for assessing the multiple mechanisms of drug action and their consequences in the human brain.",

    "48": "The effects of individual psychotropic medications on serum prolactin concentrations are described, and recommendations for dealing with adverse effects are provided. Hyperprolactinemia can result in galactorrhea, amenorrhea, irregular menses, and anovulation; in men, impotence and azoospermia, with or without lactation and gynecomastia, can occur. Antipsychotics may block dopamine receptors in the pituitary prolactin-secreting cells and prevent dopamine-induced reduction of prolactin release. The magnitude of the increase in prolactin concentration correlates with the amount of antipsychotic drug given. The treatment of choice is reduction of the antipsychotic dosage or discontinuation of therapy. If adjustments to the antipsychotic dosage fail to resolve symptoms, the dopamine agonists bromocriptine and amantadine may be tried. Antidepressants may produce elevated serum prolactin concentrations, especially with long-term administration. However, the frequency of antidepressant-induced hyperprolactinemia is much lower than that seen with antipsychotics, and serious adverse clinical effects are uncommon. Other psychotropic drugs such as lithium, valproic acid, buspirone, carbamazepine, and benzodiazepines either are only rarely associated with symptomatic hyperprolactinemia or do not produce clinically important changes in prolactin concentrations. Antipsychotic drugs are the psychotropic agents most likely to cause symptomatic hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine or amantadine may provide symptomatic relief if withdrawal or adjustment of the antipsychotic dosage does not eliminate the symptoms.",

With regard to the hypothesis that cholinergic mechanisms play a crucial role in cognitive processes, M1- and M2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, choline acetyltransferase, and high-affinity choline uptake as well as benzodiazepine receptors were studied in selected cortical regions (frontal, temporal, somatosensory, visual, piriform cortex), in amygdala, hippocampus, and in the nucleus basalis of Meynert from adult rats, which received at the age of 25 days a single dosage of 11 mg/kg, s.c. kainic acid. Kainic acid treatment of prepubescent rats resulted in the adult brain in decreased numbers of the total population of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in frontal (by 27%, P < 0.05, two-tailed Student's t-test), temporal (22%, P < 0.05), and piriform cortex (31%, P < 0.05), in amygdala (24%, P < 0.05), and nucleus basalis of Meynert (39%, P < 0.02). The binding affinity was unchanged in these regions. However, in the hippocampus, the dissociation constant was significantly increased following kainic acid treatment, while the receptor numbers remained unchanged. Analysis of competition experiments with the muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine revealed that the reductions of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the cortical regions after kainic acid treatment are mainly due to decreases in the number of the muscarinic M1-receptor subtype. In the amygdala, the numbers of both M1- and M2-receptor subtypes are reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "SPECT imaging of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor using the antagonist [123I]iomazenil in nonhuman primates was correlated with ex vivo autoradiography and in vitro receptor autoradiography of postmortem tissue sections taken at the time of maximal brain uptake of the radiotracer. Cryostat sections prepared from brain tissue blocks at the orientation of the SPECT imaging plane showed high activity in gray matter regions, with gray to white matter ratios of greater than 30:1. After at least one week decay of 123I, these same tissue sections were used to localize and quantify the distribution of BZ receptors with the standard technique of in vitro receptor autoradiography using [125I]iomazenil. The ex vivo autoradiographic distribution of activity was highly correlated (r = 0.89) with the distribution of BZ receptors, although a few brain regions showed reproducible discrepancies between ex vivo and in vitro results. The ex vivo autoradiograms provided quantitative data from a realistic \"biological phantom,\" which may be used to assess the accuracy of image reconstruction and to investigate differences between the distribution of an intravenously (i.v.) administered tracer and that of its target in brain tissue.", 
    "51": "Based on the data that diazepam, a benzodiazepine (BZP) receptor agonist, antagonized psychological (PSY)-stress induced analgesia (SIA) without prominent action on footshock (FS)- and forced swimming (SW)-SIA and that BZP receptors are coupled with GABA receptors, we examined how the GABAergic system participates in the production of various SIAs. Muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, at doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, affected each SIA differently, suppressed PSY-SIA at 0.25 mg/kg but tended to potentiate it at 1.0 mg/kg, potentiated SW-SIA dose-dependently and did not affect FS-SIA at the doses employed. Both bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg, and picrotoxin, a Cl- channel blocker, 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, dose-dependently suppressed PSY- and FS-SIA. Meanwhile, the effects of both drugs on SW-SIA were less than those on PSY- and FS-SIA, namely, bicuculline slightly inhibited it only at 2.0 mg/kg, and picrotoxin did not produce any appreciable effect even at the highest dose. Baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, at 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg had no influence on each SIA. On the contrary, CGP 35348, a GABAB receptor antagonist at 20 to 100 mg/kg caused the dose-dependent blockade of FS-SIA, but affected neither PSY- nor SW-SIA. The production of PSY- and SW-SIA is attributable to the GABAA receptors/Cl- channel mediated mechanism alone, while that of FS-SIA involves both GABAA and GABAB receptor mediated systems. Thus, GABAergic systems play an important role in the production of each SIA; however, the participation of the receptor subtypes in the mechanism was different from each other.", 
    "52": "The influence of three fluoroquinolone (FQ) antimicrobial drugs (ciprofloxacin (CP), norfloxacin (NF), enrofloxacin (EF)) on seizure parameters in amygdaloid kindled rats was investigated. CP and NF (100 mg/kg i.p.) did not modify seizure parameters while EF induced a decrease in seizure activity. Since clinical data indicate a seizure enhancing interaction between FQ and theophylline (THEO) we studied the influence of concurrent FQ-THEO administration in kindled rats. CP and NF, but not EF given concurrently with a non-seizure modulating dose of THEO (10 mg/kg i.p.) caused increases in seizure activity and aggressiveness in the animals. The CP-THEO induced seizure enhancement was antagonized by 2-chloroadenosine and diazepam. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that THEO serum levels and elimination were not altered by concurrent CP administration. We conclude that coadministration of FQ-THEO can aggravate amygdala kindled seizures and that this aggravation may involve centrally mediated mechanisms.", 
    "53": "Female rats have a higher threshold than males for seizures induced by the convulsant pentylenetetrazol, a GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex blocker. No sex difference was observed for the anticonvulsant activities of ethanol or diazepam to protect against pentylenetetrazol seizures. Ovariectomy reduces the pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold of females to that of males. In contrast, females have a lower threshold than males to electroshock seizures. Pentylenetetrazol receptors were compared in males and females and gonadectomized animals by binding of several radioligands to the GABAA receptor complex. No differences were found for these four groups of animals in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepine sites and [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) to the chloride channel/convulsant sites in membrane homogenates, nor for allosteric modulation of binding by GABA, the steroid anesthetic alphaxalone, or the benzodiazepine Ro 5-4864. In tissue section autoradiography, no difference was observed for these same assays nor for the binding of [3H]muscimol in the presence and absence of alphaxalone in several major regions. We conclude that circulating female sex hormones, possibly neurosteroid metabolites of progesterone, known to interact directly with the GABAA receptor complex, are involved in the sex differences in pentylenetetrazol seizure susceptibility.", 
    "54": "Previous evidence has demonstrated that repeated daily administration of the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone prior to assessment of pain sensitivity provokes the development of a nonopioid form of hypoalgesia. The present experiments assessed whether the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex may be involved in the mediation of this effect. Male Wistar rats were administered 10 mg/kg naloxone prior to hot-plate tests (48.5 degrees C) for pain sensitivity for 8 consecutive days. Control animals were administered saline prior to, and naloxone 2-4 h after, assessment of pain reactivity. Beginning on the fourth or fifth day of this regimen, animals tested under the influence of naloxone displayed longer paw-lick latencies than controls. Preadministration of the GABAA agonist muscimol (1.0-5.0 mg/kg) and GABAA antagonist bicuculline (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) failed to affect paw-lick latencies in naloxone-tested and control rats. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (1.0-5.0 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam (1.0-5.0 mg/kg) both elevated paw-lick latencies to the same degree in both groups of animals. These results suggest that the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex is not involved in the mediation of naloxone-induced hypoalgesia.", 
    "55": "Rats were twice daily (2 x 10 mg/kg, i.p.) treated for three weeks with the peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands Ro 5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) and PK 11,195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline-carbox ami de). After the first injection there were no differences between the drug-treated and control animals in behavioral tests. After 10 days treatment, the number of sniffings was increased in Ro 5-4864-treated rats. After the last injection, sniffings and ambulations were decreased in PK 11,195-treated animals. The number of rearings and groomings remained unchanged throughout the treatment, and there were no changes in the results in the elevated plus-maze test. Apparently these compounds are devoid of anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects at moderate doses. The effect of 72 a h withdrawal from the above mentioned chronic treatment on peripheral and central BZ receptors as well as on GABAA receptors was studied with receptor binding techniques using 3H-Ro 5-4864, 3H-flumazenil and 3H-muscimol, respectively, as ligands. The number of GABAA and central BZ receptors was lower after Ro 5-4864 treatment, as was the effect of progesterone-induced stimulation of 3H-muscimol binding. The number of peripheral BZ receptors was decreased after Ro 5-4864 and PK 11,195 treatments in the olfactory bulb but not in the cerebral cortex. The chronic treatment with peripheral BZ receptor ligands Ro 5-4864 and PK 11,195 produced only little behavioral effects. Ro 5-4864, often presented as an agonist of peripheral BZ receptors, was behaviorally inactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The expression of mRNA for GABAA receptor alpha 1-subunit in mouse cerebral cortical neurons in primary culture was examined using RNA blot analysis and ribonuclease protection assay following the treatment of neurons with muscimol, a selective agonist of GABAA receptor. The level of mRNA for GABAA receptor alpha 1-subunit showed a decrease in comparison with that in non-treated cells, whereas no changes in the level of beta-actin mRNA were noted under the same experimental conditions. This muscimol-induced reduction in GABAA receptor alpha 1-subunit mRNA was counteracted by the simultaneous exposure of neurons to both bicuculline, an antagonist of GABAA receptor, and muscimol. The expression of mRNA for GABAA receptor alpha 1-subunit also showed a decline by the treatment of cells with flunitrazepam alone, an agonist of benzodiazepine receptor, and this change was also abolished by the simultaneous exposure of cells to flunitrazepam and Ro15-1788, an antagonist for central benzodiazepine receptor. These results suggest that the continuous stimulation of cerebral GABAA receptor complex may induce the reduced expression of mRNA for the receptor complex.", 
    "57": "Naturally occurring 3-alpha-hydroxy ring A-reduced metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone and their synthetic analogues bind to specific sites within the hydrophobic channel domain of the GABAA receptor complex. Acting at these sites, these ligands function as positive allosteric effectors of the complex; they potentiate GABA-stimulated membrane chloride ion conductance, enhance the binding of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam, and displace the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), a channel ligand that is a specific marker of the GABA-associated chloride ionophore. Moreover, steroid metabolites (namely pregnenolone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) have been identified that display properties of GABA-negative allosteric effectors. The identification of this membrane-associated steroid binding should stimulate development of new classes of anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, anticonvulsant, anesthetic, and muscle-relaxant medications that may be devoid of many of the side effects associated with benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Also, elucidation of the physiologic role of this binding site should contribute both to our understanding of endogenous mechanisms for modulating inhibitory neurotransmission, and the pathophysiologic role of the GABAA receptor complex in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "58": "1. The effect of the myorelaxant drugs baclofen, diazepam and tizanidine have been compared on in vitro preparations of baby rat spinal cord and adult rat superior cervical ganglion. 2. Dorsal root-elicited long duration (time to half decay 9.71 +/- 0.29 s.e. mean, n = 31) ipsilateral ventral root reflexes (DR-VRP), measured as integrated area, of immature rat spinal cord preparations were abolished by RS-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5) (EC50 8.13 +/- 0.92 microM, n = 3). The initial short latency component of DR-VRP was resistant to AP5. 3. Baclofen abolished both components of the DR-VRP. Respective EC50 values for the AP5-insensitive and AP5-sensitive components were 237 +/- 68 nM (n +/- 7) and 57 +/- 10 nM (n = 7). These effects of baclofen were reversed by the GABAB antagonist, CGP35348. The apparent Kd values (16.7 +/- 6.4 microM, n = 3 and 14.3 +/- 3.9 microM, n = 6 respectively) for this reversal were not significantly different. 4. Tizanidine, clonidine and diazepam had no effect on the AP5-insensitive component of the DR-VRP. 5. The AP5-sensitive long duration component of the DR-VRP was depressed to respective maximal levels of 23.2 +/- 1.4% (n = 7), 18.8 +/- 3.8% (n = 4) and 47.6 +/- 1.6% (n = 5) of control (100%) levels by tizanidine (EC50 135 +/- 33 nM), clonidine (EC50 26.0 +/- 2.2 nM) and diazepam (EC25 114 +/- 12 nM, n = 4). The depressant effects of tizanidine and clonidine were reversed by idazoxan (1 microM). Flumazenil (I microM) failed to reverse the depressant effect of tizanidine. The depressant effect of diazepam was reversed by flumazenil (1 microM) but not by idazoxan (1 microM). Naloxone 1 M did not reverse the effects of either tizanidine or diazepam.6. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.1 SAM) which abolished synaptic activity, clonidine, tizanidine or diazepam (10, 100 and 101JM respectively) produced no significant antagonism of NMDA-induced depolarizations recorded from ventral roots.7. Control (100%) synaptic responses of rat superior cervical ganglion preparations were depressed respectively to near maximal levels of 60.0 +/- 5.2% (n = 4) and 60.7 +/- 5.6% (n = 5) by clonidine (0.5 JAM,EC25 15.3 +/- 3.0 nM) and tizanidine (1 JAM, EC25 227 +/- 83 nM). These depressant effects were reversed by idazoxan (1 AM). Baclofen (EC25 28.7 +/- 10.0, n = 3) depressed the postganglionic response to a maximum level of 71.8 + 2.4% (n = 4) control at a concentration of 100 microM. The latter depressant action was reversed by the GABAB receptor antagonist, CGP35348 (1 mM). Diazepam (1 microM) had no significant effect on ganglionic transmission.8. It is concluded that the activation of benzodiazepine or M2-noradrenaline receptors can modulate NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic pathways whereas synaptic excitation from primary afferent terminals, mediated by non-NMDA receptors, appears to lack the propensity for this type of modulation. The results show also that the isolated spinal preparation can be used to identify central myorelaxant actions that are mediated through functional benzodiazepine or X2-noradrenaline receptors.",

The efficacy of its analogues was measured with their ability to potentiate GABA-mediated Cl- currents in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp techniques in human kidney cells (A293 cells) expressing the subtype of the GABAA receptor. 3. The analogues displayed various levels of efficacy including agonists, partial agonists and antagonists without marked changes in their affinity for the receptors. 4. The major determinant of their efficacy was the spacial configuration of a methyl substituent of the C2 atom of the rigid and planar diimidazoquinazoline ring: U-90167, containing the methyl substituent projected below the plane of the ring, markedly enhanced the GABA current with a maximal potentiation of 220 +/- 25%, while its stereoisomer, U-90168, marginally increased the GABA response with a maximal potentiation of 45 +/- 10%, to which its methyl group appeared to contribute very little. 5. U-90167 potentiated the GABA response with an EC50 of 8.1 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.1 and did not alter the reversal potential for the Cl- current. 6. From computational modelling, the sensitive methyl group of U-90167 could be assigned to the general region for the 5-phenyl group of diazepam. The diimidazoquinazoline, because of its rigid and plantar ring structure, may be useful to define further the out-of-plane region responsible for agonistic activity and to pinpoint other areas pivotal to the functionality of benzodiazepine ligands.", 
    "60": "The CCKB antagonists L-365, 260 and PD134308 and the CCKA antagonist L-364, 718 were applied to neurones of the rat solitary complex (SC) isolated in brainstem slices, while recording either intracellularly or by whole-cell patch-clamp. The CCKB antagonists increased the amplitude of spontaneous or solitary tract-evoked Cl(-)-dependent inhibitory synaptic events by 25 +/- 5% in 5/7 neurones. These events were identified as (1) reversed spontaneous potentials, (2) reversed multisynaptic potentials and (3) outward currents blocked by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline. The CCKB antagonists had no postsynaptic action and increased excitatory synaptic events by 16 +/- 5% in only 3/9 neurones. The CCKA antagonist depolarized neurones but had no effect on synaptic events. Results suggest that CCK, released from the SC tissue, modulates GABAergic interneurones through CCKB sites. This mechanism could contribute to panic attacks, probably mediated by CCKB receptors.", 
    "61": "The ability of oxotremorine-M to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation in the presence of a variety of adenylate cyclase activators was studied in slices from the longitudinal muscle of the rat ileum. Oxotremorine-M was found to inhibit forskolin- and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation maximally by 17 and 32%, respectively, but not the stimulation due to other activators of adenylate cyclase. Inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation by oxotremorine-M was unaffected by tetrodotoxin and was completely reversed by atropine. AF-DX 116 (11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1- piperidynyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3- b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) an M2-selective antagonist, shifted the oxotremorine-M dose-response curve to the right with a dissociation constant (KB) of 0.20 microM, consistent with the dissociation constants for binding at the M2 muscarinic receptor site (KD = 0.092 microM) and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (KB = 0.13 microM). Hexahydrosiladifenidol, an M3-selective antagonist, shifted the oxotremorine-M dose-response curve to the right with a dissociation constant of 0.67 microM, again consistent with the dissociation constant for binding at the M2 site (KD = 0.83 microM). The agreement between the estimates of the dissociation constants of muscarinic antagonists for binding and for inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation suggest that oxotremorine-M inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in slices of rat intestinal smooth muscle is mediated by the M2 receptor.", 
    "62": "Gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptor binding sites and the N-methyl-D-aspartate subclass of glutamate receptor sites were assessed in synaptic plasma membrane homogenates of cerebral cortex tissue obtained at autopsy from cirrhotic and noncirrhotic alcoholic patients and matched control subjects. The alcoholic patients consumed an average of greater than 80 g of ethanol/day, the control subjects less than 20 g/day. Postmortem delays up to approximately 100 h caused no significant loss of any of the binding sites; the patient and subject groups were closely matched for age. The affinities (KD) of the receptor sites did not differ between the patient and subject groups, nor between cortical regions. Using three different radioligands ([3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam, and [3H]diazepam), the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptor complex was found to have greater density (Bmax) in superior frontal gyrus in alcoholic patients (which selectively shows morphological change in alcoholic patients), but was unchanged in motor cortex. Alcoholic patients with cirrhosis had much less pronounced changes. The density of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subclass of glutamate receptors, assessed with [3H]MK-801, did not vary across patient and subject groups.", 
    "63": "The expression of c-fos mRNA in rat brain was induced by intraperitoneal administration of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and picrotoxin, which act on the picrotoxin binding site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABA-BZ) receptor complex, by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid, agonists of different classes of glutamate receptors and by caffeine, an antagonist of adenosine receptors. The actions of PTZ and picrotoxin but not that of NMDA were blocked by ethanol and the NMDA-receptor antagonist, MK-801. Ro 15-4513 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of ethanol on PTZ-induced c-fos mRNA synthesis. Acute ethanol administration blocked the actions of PTZ and NMDA without affecting the response to kainic acid or caffeine. Taken together, these data suggest that ethanol blocks c-fos gene activation by noncompetitive antagonists of the GABA-BZ receptor via actions on both the NMDA and GABA receptors.", 
    "64": "A prospective randomized double blind study was carried out on 60 patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients in group A were sedated with diazepam (0.15 mg/kg) and those in group B received midazolam (0.10 mg/kg). There were no differences between the groups in age, sex, previous drug intake, level of anxiety prior to the procedure and from the endoscopist point of view the easiness to perform the studies. The group of patients who received midazolam (B) showed a significantly greater sedation, had less pain in the site of injection, their retrograde amnesia was more effective and tolerated much better the overall procedure (p < 0.05). There were no complications in either group. The cost per dosage was 2:1 greater with midazolam. It is concluded that midazolam has some advantages over diazepam used for sedation of patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. The time for recovery and cost are its disadvantages.", 
    "65": "These results support other studies that indicate that M.V.D. is the best procedure to treat these patients. There are some points to emphasize M.V.D. in order to achieve the best results and lowest complication rate. These include good preoperative patient preparation; more lateral suboccipital craniectomy to expose the cranial nerves with minimal retraction; adequate drainage of CSF from the cistern before attempting to identify the nerve; thorough inspection of the affected cranial nerve, especially in the root entry (exit) zone; adequate mobilization of blood vessels and stable interposition of teflon felt between the blood vessels and the affected nerve.", 
    "66": "Peripheral nerve injury or amputation leads to extensive changes within the central representations of the mammalian body surface. The mechanisms responsible for post-traumatic reorganization of these maps in adults may also, at least partly, underlie a more general feature of the somatosensory system--the capacity for stimulus-dependent plasticity. Acetylcholine has been implicated in both of these processes. We studied the binding of the ligands [3H]QNB and [3H]pirenzepine in rat hindlimb somatosensory cortex from 1 to 14 days following sciatic nerve transection. Although the [3H]QNB binding was not different from normal levels in tissue homogenates of the affected somatosensory cortex, differences were demonstrated when binding was measured on a layer-by-layer basis. [3H]QNB binding was changed only in certain layers, at certain times. The predominant effects appeared to be a decrease in binding in the middle layers from 4 to 14 days after the transection. Combining the [3H]QNB data with data obtained from the more M1-selective ligand [3H]pirenzepine suggested that complex changes occur among several muscarinic receptors, including receptors with non-M1 subtype characteristics. Moreover, unilateral nerve transection affects the hindlimb somatosensory regions in both hemispheres.", 
    "67": "A double-blind study was performed to evaluate carbamazepine for the prophylaxis of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in elderly patients--a controversial subject despite the extensive use of such drugs in old age. Thirty-six outpatients aged > or = 60 yrs suffering from general anxiety disorders and benzodiazepine abuse underwent gradual discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy in two groups, one treated with carbamazepine and one with placebo. The carbamazepine-treated group demonstrated a lower incidence of withdrawal symptoms rated according to the Physician Withdrawal Check List (p < 0.01), better results with the Hopkins Symptom Check List (Covi cluster, p < 0.01) and a more markedly reduced score with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (p < 0.05). Only 3 out of 18 patients in said group complained of side effects attributable to carbamazepine, which disappeared at lower dosages.", 
    "68": "The effects of alfentanil-midazolam anaesthesia upon the electrophysiologic (EP) properties of normal atrioventricular (A-V) and accessory pathway (AP) conduction were studied in eight patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during accessory pathway surgical ablation. The presence of an AP was confirmed by preoperative EP studies. Anaesthesia was induced with alfentanil (50 micrograms.kg-1) and midazolam (0.15 mg.kg-1) and maintained with an alfentanil infusion (2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and intermittent boluses of midazolam (1-2 mg q 15 min, PRN). Following sternotomy, a baseline EP study was performed which consisted of effective refractory period (ERP) and shortest cycle length (SCC) measurement during antegrade conduction in the AV and AP, as well as during retrograde conduction in the AP. Comparison with preoperative EP studies indicated that the administration of alfentanil-midazolam anaesthesia had no effect upon conduction or ERP in either pathway. Haemodynamic stability occurred throughout the surgical procedure with no tachyarrhythmias. We conclude that a combination of alfentanil-midazolam is suitable for general anaesthesia in patients undergoing ablative procedures for accessory pathways.", 
    "69": "Over a five-year period (1985-1989) among a population of 5 million, a survey was made of the presence of amphetamine in 741 cases, in living persons where the police had asked for analyses for amphetamine(s), narcotics, heroin-like compounds, methadone etc. Cases, where the requisition was for morphine (heroin) only, were not included, on account of analytical reasons. Two hundred and fifty-nine cases were found to be positive for amphetamine, with only 18 cases in 1985 followed by approximately 60 cases per year during the remainder of the period. Most of the cases concerned men (93%). The age range was 15-58 years with a median of 26 years. In 194 of the amphetamine-positive cases where relevant information was available, 56% were cases of violation of the traffic laws, 17% were cases of violence, 3% were cases of sexual offence and 9% were cases of robbery. Nineteen of the 259 amphetamine-positive cases were analysed only for amphetamine and, in 75 cases, only amphetamine was found. In the 165 remaining cases, there were 279 positive findings of other drugs/narcotics than amphetamine with benzodiazepines, morphine, cannabis and methadone as the main groups with 86, 57, 49 and 44 findings respectively.", 
    "70": "Primary cultures of chick cerebral cortical neurons were exposed to 1 microM flurazepam in vitro, and the effect of flurazepam on GABA-activated membrane current (IGABA) was examined using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording. Exposure of chick cerebral cortical neurons to flurazepam alone for 3-10 days resulted in a significant decrease in the degree of potentiation of IGABA elicited by 0.5 microM flurazepam. When GABA or nipecotic acid (a GABA uptake blocker) were added with flurazepam during chronic drug exposure, neuronal responses to GABA were significantly less sensitive to modulation by 0.5 microM flurazepam compared to flurazepam treatment alone. Furthermore, this effect was significantly reduced by co-administration of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. These results suggest that tolerance to benzodiazepines in vitro requires activation of both the GABA and the benzodiazepine binding sites on the GABAA receptor-channel complex.", 
    "71": "Protoporphyrin IX (PP) and N-methylprotoporphyrin IX (N-MePP) added in vitro to liver membranes reduced dose-dependently the affinity of [3H]PK 11195 for the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBRs), the latter being about 20 times more potent (Ki 4.5 and 0.25 microM). Preincubation of these two porphyrins with liver homogenates for 120 min at 4 degrees resulted in significant inhibition of [3H]PK 11195 binding even after repeated washings of the membranes due to the residual presence in the membranes of about 35 and 5% of PP and N-MePP, respectively. Thus, the hypothesis that an in vivo increase in the hepatic porphyrin content modifies the binding of the isoquinoline PK 11195 to the MBRs was investigated in an experimental model of protoporphyria. PP and N-MePP were allowed to accumulate in vivo through treatment with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) (100 mg/kg i.p., once), and rats were killed 5 h after treatment when hepatic porphyrin accumulation was marked (10-fold increase), PP predominating. In the liver, treatment reduced the affinity (Kd) of [3H]PK 11195 for MBRs (from 3.56 to 15.37 nM, P < 0.01) and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) (55% decrease, P < 0.05); the affinity (Ki) of RO 5-4864 for [3H]PK 11195 binding sites was also reduced (from 23.9 to 72.99 nM, P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in the brain cortex. Liver and brain diazepam binding inhibitor levels and plasma corticosterone levels were unchanged. The reduction in [3H]PK 11195 binding to MBRs in the liver of DDC-treated rats thus appears to be attributable to a specific effect of the DDC-induced formation of the two protoporphyrins; this conclusion suggests that in hepatic protoporphyria processes modulated by MBRs may be altered.", 
    "72": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDPX) enhanced the rate of chloride exchange mediated by the major GABAA receptor found on sealed native membrane vesicles from rat cerebral cortex. The initial rate constant for chloride exchange for this receptor, (JA), a measure of open channel, was determined from the progress of GABA-mediated influx of 36Cl-. The dependence of JA on GABA concentration was hyperbolic in the presence of CDPX (150 microM, sufficient to give maximum enhancement of chloride exchange rate) but sigmoid in its absence. Enhancement of channel opening (10-fold at 0.3 microM GABA) decreased with increasing GABA concentration. The maximal response, above 1,000 microM GABA, was unaltered. The half-response concentration was reduced from 80 microM to 50 microM. CDPX alone caused no measurable 36Cl- exchange. In the presence of CDPX, channel opening occurred with only one bound GABA molecule, whereas in its absence, channel opening with two bound GABA molecules was much more favorable. This could not be direct allosteric modulation of the channel opening conformational change by binding of CDPX at effector sites, but could be explained by an additional change of the receptor on binding CDPX to give a closed state which gave channel opening mediated by a single GABA binding site. Another possibility is that CDPX could act at one of the channel opening binding sites without a postulated, second closed conformational state.", 
    "73": "Dysmorphism and mental retardation have been reported in 7 Swedish children born of mothers who had taken high doses of benzodiazepines regularly during pregnancy. To explore this association further, we examined benzodiazepine use during pregnancy in 104,000 women whose deliveries were registered by the US public health insurance system, Medicaid, during 1980-83. Fetal outcomes were assessed from the health claims profiles of their offspring, up to 6-9 years after delivery. 80 pregnant women had received 10 or more benzodiazepine prescriptions during the 4 years. Their records showed heavy general use of health care and frequent alcohol and substance abuse, and other disorders that could confound any effect of the benzodiazepines. For the 80 pregnancies, 3 intrauterine deaths were identified as well as 2 infants with congenital abnormalities whose curtailed records suggested neonatal death. Records of 64 surviving children could be linked to these 80 pregnancies whilst records for 11 apparent survivors could not be located. 6 of the 64 survivors had diagnoses consistent with teratogenic abnormalities. The high rate of teratogenicity after heavy maternal benzodiazepine use occurs with multiple alcohol and substance exposure and thus may not be due to benzodiazepine exposure.", 
    "74": "Systemic injection of kainic acid (KA) does not cause neuronal pathology in limbic structures in rat brain prior to postnatal day (PND) 21. The present study tested if the development of the pathogenic response is associated with the maturation of a link between seizure activity and polyamine metabolism. Pathology was assessed with histological techniques and with the binding of [3H]Ro5-4864, a ligand for the peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites (PTBBS), a marker of glial cell proliferation. In agreement with previous results, peripherally administered kainate at doses sufficient to induce intense behavioral seizures produced a loss of Nissl staining in hippocampus after PND 21 but not at earlier ages. The pattern of neuronal damage observed after PND 21 resembled that found in adult animals: extensive losses of Nissl staining in area CA3 of hippocampus and in piriform cortex, more modest effects in CA1 and sparing of the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Similarly, no increase in [3H]Ro5-4864 binding as a result of KA administration was observed in hippocampus and piriform cortex until PND 21. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and putrescine levels were high in the neonatal brain and decreased to reach adult values by PND 21. KA-induced seizure activity did not significantly alter both variables until PND 21. After PND 21, ODC activity and putrescine levels markedly increased 16 h after KA-induced seizure activity in hippocampus and piriform cortex. The magnitude of the effects increased between PND 21 and PND 30, at which point the changes in both parameters were comparable to those found in adults. Polyamines stimulate the activity of the calcium-dependent proteases calpain in brain fractions and may increase calpain-mediated proteolysis in situ. In accord with this, kainate-induced breakdown of spectrin, a preferred substrate of calpain, measured 16 h after KA injection followed a developmental curve parallel to that for kainate-induced increases in putrescine levels. These results indicate that the onset of vulnerability to seizure activity triggered by kainic acid is correlated with the development of an ODC/polyamine response to the seizures and further support a critical role for the ODC/polyamine pathway in neuronal pathology following a variety of insults.", 
    "75": "Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) procedures for the systematic toxicological analysis of several categories of drugs relevant to clinical toxicology, forensic toxicology and doping control are reviewed. Papers from 1981 to 1991 are taken into consideration. They describe the detection of acute or chronic intoxication and the detection of drug abuse. Screening procedures are included for the following categories: barbiturates and other sedative-hypnotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, phenothiazine and butyrophenone neuroleptics, central stimulants (amphetamines, cocaine), hallucinogens (LSD, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol), opioid (narcotic) and other potent analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, antihistamines (histamine H1-receptor blockers), antiparkinsonian drugs, beta-blockers (beta-adrenoceptor blockers), antiarrhythmics (class I and IV), diuretics, laxatives and their metabolites. Methods for confirmation of results obtained by screening procedures using immunoassay or chromatographic techniques are also included. GC-MS procedures for the simultaneous detection of several categories of drugs, the so-called \"general unknown analysis\", are reviewed. The toxicological question to be answered and the consequence for the choice of an adequate method, the sample preparation and the chromatography itself are discussed. The basic information about the biosample assayed, work-up, GC column, mass spectral detection mode, reference data and sensitivity of each procedure are summarized in tables, arranged according to the category of drug. Examples of typical GC-MS applications are presented. Fragment ions that are suitable for mass spectral screening for particular categories of drugs and for general unknown are tabulated.",

In the past year nearly one-third of both patient groups had seen three or more different health care professionals and almost one-fifth of those with panic disorder had gone to a general hospital emergency department. Of the patients with panic disorder 9% had previously been assessed by a cardiologist and 17% by a neurologist. At least two-thirds of each group had received benzodiazepines, often for use as needed. Although most of the patients in both groups had been seen by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, few had received optimal treatment. Of those with panic disorder, only 15% had received the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, 13% alprazolam and 11% cognitive-behavioural therapy. Only 4% of the patients with social phobia had received cognitive-behavioural therapy.",

    "83": "This paper demonstrates that most common drugs of abuse can be absorbed simultaneously onto a mixed-mode bonded-phase matrix and eluted sequentially in two to three steps for subsequent analysis by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC). Having on-column multiwavelength UV absorption detection, this is shown to be an attractive approach for confirmation testing of barbiturates, hypnotics, amphetamines, opioids, benzodiazepines, and metabolites of cocaine in a single aliquot of human urine. For these compounds, no hydroysis of the urine specimen or sample derivatization is required. Under the examined conditions using 5 mL of urine, excellent recoveries (80-90% level) and detection limits (about 100 ng/mL) are obtained. For patient urines which tested positively for different classes of drugs using immunological screening methods, a two-step extraction scheme is shown to provide extracts suitable for rapid MECC confirmation of the drugs of abuse.",

    "85": "A water soluble benzodiazepine, clorazepate, has been used to establish the point of benzodiazepine proliferative arrest in the rat C6 glioma. Clorazepate inhibited C6 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 280 microM, as judged by a nuclei counting procedure. Release of cells from a 48 h exposure to 350 microM clorazepate, at which over 70% of the cells were arrested, resulted in a synchronous entry into S phase 8-9 h later, as evidenced by a sharp increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. This restriction point was demonstrated to be 2-3 h into the G1 phase by measuring the length of G1 in synchronized populations of C6 cells obtained by selection of mitotic figures from an asynchronous culture. Synchronous arrest of C6 by clorazepate required an exposure period of 24-36 h, approximately twice the doubling time of the cell line. A morphological study confirmed an early G1 point of proliferative arrest. Clorazepate synchronized cells exhibited a uniform morphology with the majority of cells assuming a configuration representative of anchorage-dependent cells in an early phase of attachment. The majority of cells were somewhat rounded and attached to the substratum by cytoplasmic 'skirts' with punctate structures which may represent focal adhesion points.", 
    "86": "Populations of dopamine (DA) neurons in the rat brain are selectively activated by stress, and the response is attenuated by the administration of anxiolytics. Given the role of the component nuclei of the amygdaloid complex in conditioned associations, stress responses and the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, we hypothesized that particular mesoamygdaloid DA projections might be especially sensitive to the effects of conditioned stress and to diazepam (DZ). We mapped the effect of a conditioned stressor on the concentration of the DA metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) in distinct amygdaloid nuclei and other brain nuclei and areas and the effect of DZ (1 or 3 mg/kg) on the conditioned response in drug-experienced subjects. The conditioned stress paradigm resulted in significant elevations in classical indices of stress, including serum corticosterone and plasma epinephrine. Conditioned stress-induced increases in the estimated activity of DA neurons were specific for DA neurons projecting to the central, basolateral and lateral amygdaloid nuclei, and for DA projections to the dorsal septal nucleus. Conditioned stress-induced increases in the HVA concentration of responsive amygdaloid nuclei were antagonized by low, anxiolytic doses of DZ. These results indicate a role for a subset of mesoamygdaloid DA projections in transducing the impact of perceived stressors on the output of the amygdaloid complex. A role for particular amygdaloid DA projections in the formation of conditioned fear or anticipatory anxiety and its modulation by anxiolytics is also suggested.", 
    "87": "The putative muscarinic M1 receptor agonist, AF102B, was applied to rat hippocampal slices and the responses of intracellularly recorded pyramidal cells were examined. AF102B mimicked some effects of acetylcholine on these cells as follows: at low concentration, AF102B attenuated a slow after-hyperpolarization in response to a long depolarizing current pulse. This effect was blocked by the M1 antagonist, pirenzepine. At higher concentrations, AF102B also depolarized the cells and caused an increase in their input resistance. AF102B did not affect local excitatory postsynaptic potentials or reactivity to topically applied excitatory amino acid substances. These experiments indicate that AF102B acts as an agonist at some muscarinic M1 receptor subtypes in mammalian brain.",

    "90": "Several novel, structurally distinct classes of specific human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) nonnucleoside inhibitors have been described recently. These include the pyridinone derivatives L-697,639, L-697,661, and L-696,229 as well as BI-RG-587 and the tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-j,k]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione compounds. Previous studies have implicated involvement of the RT amino acid residues at positions 103, 181, and 188 in the activity of the compounds. Accordingly, HIV-1 RT mutants containing a series of amino acid substitutions at these positions were constructed. The relative resistance of purified mutant enzymes to each of the inhibitors was assessed. This analysis established the functional equivalence of the three inhibitor classes and provided evidence for the interaction of the 103 site with the 181/188 region. Amino acid substitutions at these positions were also found to influence RT sensitivity to inhibition by phosphonoformate, thereby suggesting a close association between this pyrophosphate analog's binding site in RT and the binding site of the nonnucleoside inhibitors. In addition, aromatic stacking of the amino acid side groups at residues 181 and 188 was suggested to be required for inhibitor activity.", 
    "91": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram of rats with lesions in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNx) were recorded during two series of 24-h baseline, 6-h sleep deprivation (SD), and 24-h recovery. At recovery onset, rats were injected i.p. with vehicle (VEH) control solution or 0.4 mg/kg triazolam (TRZ) in a balanced crossover design. Consecutive 10-s epochs were scored for vigilance states and EEG power spectra were computed. Arousal states were uniformly distributed during 24-h baseline (wake 47% of recording time, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (nonREMS) 47%, REMS 7%), and EEG spectra (0-25 Hz) were devoid of significant trends. State-specific EEG power spectra profiles in SCNx rats were similar to those of intact animals reported previously. However, EEG delta power (0.5-3.5 Hz) of nonREMS was markedly lower in SCNx rats. Recovery from 6-h SD was characterised by a short-lasting reduction of REMS, and a long-lasting increase of nonREMS time at the cost of wakefulness. EEG delta power rebounded during the first 8 h in recovery, and fell below baseline level after 12 h in recovery. During 0-2 h TRZ recovery, rats spent more time in nonREMS with higher EEG slow wave activity as compared to the corresponding VEH recovery period. EEG slow wave activity fell below baseline levels 10 h after TRZ injection and termination of SD. We conclude that major features of homeostatic sleep EEG regulation are present in SCNx rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "92": "The peptide messengers neuropeptide Y (NPY), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and beta-endorphin (BEND) were tested in an animal model of anxiety, the Geller-Seifter conflict test. Rats were subjected to a multiple schedule consisting of three components: in the first component, lever-pressing produced food-reward ('unpunished responding'). The second component was a time-out period, during which lever-pressing had no consequences. During the third component, lever-pressing produced food-reward, but was also punished by an incremental foot-shock ('punished responding'). After establishing a stable baseline of both unpunished and punished responding, animals were injected with various doses of NPY, GHRH, ANP, BEND, or with saline into the lateral cerebral ventricle, and testing was repeated. While changes in unpunished responding can reflect alterations in performance factors or motivational strength, increases in punished responding have previously been shown to be highly specific for anxiety-reducing drugs, such as the benzodiazepines. NPY markedly and dose-dependently increased punished responding. A smaller increase of unpunished responding was also seen. These results add further support to the hypothesis that NPY may be an endogenous anxiolytic. GHRH, ANP and END did not affect punished responding.", 
    "93": "alpha(2)-Adrenozeptoragonisten agonists have shown antinociceptive and analgesic effects, which are not antagonized by naloxone. Therefore, the mechanism of action should be independent of opioid receptors. Most studies on this topic have been performed using clonidine. Experimentally the analgesic effect of clonidine can be suppressed by the inhibition of central adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, clonidine has analgesic effects at the spinal level. During recent years numerous studies have shown the analgesic effect of spinally or epidurally administered clonidine in humans. However, only very few studies have investigated the analgesic effect of parenterally administered clonidine in humans.", 
    "94": "After the approval of the local ethical committee had been obtained, 60 patients (ASA I-III, age 18-65 years) scheduled for elective orthopaedic procedures were included in this double-blind randomized study. All patients gave their written consent on the day before the operation. Premedication was standardized and involved benzodiazepines. Isoflurane was used as the sole anaesthetic. Postoperatively the pain level of the patients was controlled by a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10). When the VAS reached at least 5 and the patients requested an analgesic, they were randomly assigned to either the morphine, tramadol or clonidine group. Twenty patients received 5 mg morphine i.v., 20 patients received 50 mg tramadol and 20 patients received 150 clonidine i.v. If the analgesic effect was insufficient, the above-mentioned dosage was repeated after 30 min. The therapy was classified as a failure if no sufficent analgesia could be achieved within 60 min. These patients received 7.5 mg piritramide i.v. VAS and sedation were measured at 10-min intervals during the 1 st h and at 15-min intervals during the following 2h. Heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation were measured at 5-min intervals during the whole study period. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by ANOVA, Wilcoxon test, Student'st-test and chi-square test using a level of significance ofP<0.05.", 
    "95": "All groups were comparable as regards their basic clinical parameters. Morphine, tramadol and clonidine significantly reduced the VAS within 20 min. During the whole study period the analgesic effect of clonidine was comparable with that of morphine and tramadol. No significant differences were observed in the number of repetitions after 30 min or in the failure rate. After 2 h sedation was significantly higher in the morphine group. No clinically relevant cardiovascular or respiratory side-effects were observed in any of the patients.", 
    "96": "In our study the analgesic effect of 150 mug clonidine i.v. was equivalent to that of 5 mg morphine i.v. and 50 mg tramadol. Our results in humans confirm the dosage relationship of 1ratio30 found by Eisenach in sheep. Further studies on the use of parenteral clonidine for postoperative analgesia seem to be warranted.", 
    "97": "Tetanus is a preventable disease with proper immunization. The marked decline in the incidence over the past several decades has resulted from widespread use of tetanus prophylaxis and improved wound management in the emergency department. Emergency physicians are among the most frequent providers of tetanus vaccination. We can stress the importance of proper immunization and encourage patients to keep accurate immunization records. This can maximize protection of patients from tetanus, and minimize adverse reactions from excessive administration of booster. Tetanus can be fatal even with proper treatment. Vital treatment measures can easily be completed in the emergency department.", 
    "98": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) exerts an influential effect on the growth of normal pancreas. It is postulated that carcinoma arising from the pancreas may retain some normal pancreatic properties as far as hormone dependency is concerned. In an effort to examine the effect of CCK on the growth of pancreatic cancer, we evaluated the effect of CCK receptor antagonist on the growth of a transplantable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. For this study we utilized three groups of hamsters with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas transplanted subcutaneously on the right flank. Group I (n = 15) served as control. Group II (n = 15) received CCK receptor antagonist (L-364,718), 0.1 mg/100 g body wt subcutaneously BID. Group III received CCK receptor antagonist in the same dose but treatment was started after tumors became palpable. All animals were examined daily. Latency for tumor growth, tumor size, and body weight were recorded. Animals were sacrificed after 3 weeks and final tumor volume and weight were measured. CCK receptor antagonist (L-364,718) significantly reduced pancreatic carcinoma growth when given immediately after transplantation and also in animals with established tumor. However, this inhibitory effect of L-364,718 was only partial and effective only for a brief time. This finding suggests CCK may have only a minimal influence on the biologic behavior of exocrine pancreatic cancer.", 
    "99": "Subtype-selective antagonists of the peripheral-type (CCK-A) and the central-type (CCK-B) cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors were employed to determine the receptor subtype(s) mediating the modulatory actions of CCK on dopamine-induced changes in exploratory activity at three sites in the mesolimbic pathway of the rat. The CCK-A antagonist L-364,718 (10 ng) blocked CCK potentiation of dopamine-induced hyperlocomotion in the medial posterior nucleus accumbens. The CCK-B antagonist CI-988 (20 ng) blocked CCK inhibition of dopamine-induced hyperlocomotion in the anterior nucleus accumbens. The CCK-B antagonists CI-988 (20 ng) and L-365,260 (10 ng) blocked CCK potentiation of dopamine-induced hypolocomotion in the ventral tegmental area. These data indicate a CCK-B pharmacology in the cell body and anterior terminal field, and a CCK-A pharmacology in the posterior terminal field, of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Behavioral analyses using the selective CCK antagonists did not detect a contribution of endogenous CCK to exploratory locomotion. L-364,718 (10 ng), L-365,260 (10 ng), and CI-988 (20 ng or 2 micrograms), microinjected into the medial posterior nucleus accumbens, anterior nucleus accumbens, or ventral tegmental area, had no effect on baseline exploratory locomotion or on dopamine-induced changes in exploratory locomotion. Using a dark-induced hyperlocomotion paradigm, the CCK antagonists at these doses at these sites and intraperitoneally had no effect on the high levels of exploratory locomotor activity exhibited by the rats in the dark testing environment, or the lower levels of exploratory activity in the lighted environment. Endogenous CCK may not be released during dopamine-induced hyperlocomotion or dark-induced hyperlocomotion, or endogenous CCK may not contribute significantly to exploratory behaviors mediated through the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Utilization of these potent, selective, nonpeptide CCK antagonists, with the doses, vehicles, and routes of administration developed in the present studies, will guide further investigations into the role of endogenous CCK in other facets of mesolimbic function.", 
    "100": "Chromatographic separations in conjunction with physical chemical detection methods can provide extremely accurate and highly precise measurements of drugs in biological matrices. Immunochemical methods for drug analyses, on the other hand, although usually fully automated, often lack accuracy, may be subject to matrix interference effects, and frequently exhibit nonlinearities that contribute to suboptimal analytical results. Automated capillary electrophoresis (CE) promises the high accuracy and precision of physical methods with no operator intervention once the sample is loaded into the sample cup. A clean-up step is necessary for the analysis of drugs in biological matrices, but that could also be fully automated. Reagent costs per test with CE approach zero, because of the use of extremely small volumes of buffers, standards, and controls. We present data supporting CE as an alternative separation strategy for 28 commonly used therapeutic drugs. These can be resolved in less than 16 min with an optimized micelle-based buffer system.", 
    "101": "The authors report on three patients who developed severe postictal excitement at several consecutive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments. In all three cases, an increase in the anesthetic (or equivalent medication) dosage prior to ECT prevented the emergence of postictal excitement at subsequent treatments. This strategy, among others, should be considered in the management of patients who repeatedly manifest this phenomenon during a course of ECT.", 
    "102": "The present study investigated the effects of three centrally acting drugs on the significant increase in the intermediate alpha frequency of the electroencephalogram (EEG) that accompanied meditation in a male volunteer. When compared to the EEG recorded before each of the three drugs was administered, naloxone tended to enhance the increase in the power of the intermediate alpha EEG (9.4-10.4 Hz), while diazepam tended to spread the increase to the slow (7.4-9.4 Hz) alpha EEG, and flumazenil was without much effect on the overall EEG pattern. However, these EEG changes when compared to similar changes obtained with saline administration were not significantly different from the latter. Thus, it is unlikely that the EEG correlates of meditation are causally related to the rise or fall of endogenous opioid peptides or benzodiazepinelike substances in the brain.", 
    "103": "Panic disorder occurs in up to 3 percent of the population and can be socially, emotionally and occupationally disabling. A thorough clinical evaluation is crucial to exclude illnesses with similar presentations, particularly acute cardiac, gastrointestinal or neurologic disease. The noradrenergic nervous system is involved in panic attacks. These attacks are described as sudden, unexpected episodes of intense fear or discomfort, usually lasting five to 30 minutes. Appropriate medications include benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Alprazolam and clonazepam are quickly effective in alleviating panic, but they cause significant symptoms upon discontinuation. The best-studied drug in the treatment of panic disorder is imipramine; like other tricyclic antidepressants, it can cause increased jitteriness early in treatment. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be particularly helpful in patients with panic disorder who exhibit social avoidance. Behavior therapy, an important component of treatment, involves the patient's confrontation of fears or phobias.", 
    "104": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) effect parameters may be useful in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling studies of drug effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Effect parameters derived from a quantitative analysis of the EEG appear to be perfectly suited to characterise the relationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines and intravenous anaesthetics. EEG parameters represent many of the characteristics of ideal pharmacodynamic measures, being continuous, objective, sensitive and reproducible. These features provide the opportunity to derive concentration-effect relationships for these drugs in individuals, which yield important quantitative information on the potency and intrinsic efficacy of these drugs. The EEG techniques presented can be used to study the influences of factors such as age, disease, chronic drug use and drug interactions on the concentration-effect relationships of psychotropic drugs. An important issue is the choice of the EEG parameter to characterise the CNS effects of the compounds. More attention must be paid to evaluating the relevance of EEG parameters to the pharmacological effects of the drugs. Knowledge of the relationship between EEG effect parameters and clinical effects of drugs under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions is crucial to determining the value of EEG parameters in drug effect monitoring. Pharmacodynamic parameters derived from the concentration-EEG effect relationship may be correlated to pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from other in vitro and in vivo effect measurements. These comparisons revealed that changes in the amplitudes in the beta frequency band of EEG signals is a relevant measure of pharmacological effect intensity of benzodiazepines, which reflects their affinity and intrinsic efficacy at the central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptor complex. The exact EEG correlates of the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic actions of benzodiazepines have not yet clearly been elucidated. For intravenous anaesthetics, close correlations between the potency determined with EEG measurements and clinical measures of anaesthetic depth have been established, suggesting that, in principle, EEG parameters can adequately reflect depth of anaesthesia. However, more study is required to further substantiate these findings."
