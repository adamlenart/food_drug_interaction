    "0": "A review of national poison center data from 1990 through 2003 showed approximately 10,000 annual ingestion exposures to camphor-containing products. A guideline that determines the threshold dose for emergency department referral and need for pre-hospital decontamination could potentially avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, optimize patient outcome, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the primary author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with suspected exposures to camphor-containing products by 1) describing the manner in which an exposure to camphor might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of camphor exposure, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to camphor exposure alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances, such as in commercial products of camphor combined with other ingredients, could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline, and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with stated or suspected self-harm or who are the recipients of malicious administration of a camphor-containing product should be referred to an emergency department immediately, regardless of the amount ingested (Grade D). 2) Patients who have ingested more than 30 mg/kg of a camphor-containing product or who are exhibiting symptoms of moderate to severe toxicity (e.g., convulsions, lethargy, ataxia, severe nausea and vomiting) by any route of exposure should be referred to an emergency department for observation and treatment (Grade D). 3) Patients exhibiting convulsions following a camphor exposure should be transported to an emergency department by pre-hospital emergency medical care providers (Grade D). A benzodiazepine should be used to control convulsions (Grade C). 4) Patients who have been exposed to a camphor product and who remain asymptomatic after 4 hours can be safely observed at home (Grade C). 5) Induction of emesis with ipecac syrup should not be performed in patients who have ingested camphor products (Grade C). 6) Activated charcoal administration should not be used for the ingestion of camphor products. However, it could be considered if there are other ingredients in the product that are effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal or if other substances have been co-ingested. (Grade C). 7) For asymptomatic patients with topical exposures to camphor products, the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water and the patient can be observed at home for development of symptoms (Grade C). 8) For patients with topical splash exposures of camphor to the eye(s), the eye(s) should be irrigated in accordance with usual poison center procedures and that referral take place based on the presence and severity of symptoms (Grade D). 9) Patients with camphor inhalation exposures should be moved to a fresh air environment and referred for medical care based on the presence and severity of symptoms. It is unlikely that symptoms will progress once the patient is removed from the exposure environment (Grade D).", 
    "1": "In this paper, a simple and robust method for the determination of clonazepam and its primary metabolite (7-aminoclonazepam) in whole blood is described. Clonazepam (klonopin) is a popular prescription drug that has been implicated in the field of drug facilitated sexual assaults (DFSA). Clonazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam and the internal standards (deuterated analogues for GC-MS analysis and nitrazepam for analysis by LC-PDA/GC-MS) were spiked into blood samples. The samples were buffered with a pH 6-phosphate solution (5 mL) and extracted from phenyl spe columns. The columns were washed with 5% acetonitrile in pH 6-phosphate buffer (3 mL) and eluted with ethyl acetate (2 x 3 mL). The eluents were evaporated for further chromatographic analysis. For GC-MS, the samples were derivatized prior to analysis. When performed with LC-PDA the samples were reconstituted in distilled water. From this method LOQs of 5 ng/mL of sample is easily achievable by either chromatographic system. By using GC-MS in EI mode, 1 ng/mL of sample can be detected. Data is presented here to show the simplicity and efficiency of the extraction scheme. By employing the properties of GC-MS and LC-PDA, this extraction and analysis procedure further extends the number of tools open to the forensic toxicologist for the analysis of this drug.", 
    "2": "5-Methyl-1-[[2-[(2-methyl-3-pyridyl)oxyl]-5-pyridyl]carbamoyl]-6-trifluoromethylindone (SB 243213) is a selective, high-affinity 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)(2C) receptor ligand that has been previously characterized as a competitive 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist that has a long duration of activity in vivo. It is active in two preclinical models of anxiety and has an improved anxiolytic profile compared with benzodiazepines. In this study, we further characterized the pharmacological properties of SB 243213 by measuring its effects on each of multiple responses coupled to the 5-HT(2C) receptor. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, SB 243213 was an inverse agonist for the phospholipase A(2) response, for guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate binding, for reduction of constitutive desensitization, and for enhancement of dopamine release in the rat nucleus accumbens, with relative efficacies of 0.6, 1, 1, and 0.6, respectively. However, for the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascade, SB 243213 behaved as an antagonist. Although SB 243213 was previously characterized as a competitive antagonist for the PLC response, the magnitude of the dextral shift of the 5-HT concentration-response curve was time-dependent, and the maximal PLC response to 5-HT was decreased, probably as a result of the slow dissociation rate of SB 243213 (initial dissociation rate was 3.2 times slower than SB206553, a prototypical 5-HT(2C) receptor inverse agonist). Taken together, these data show that the pharmacological characteristics of SB 243213 at the 5-HT(2C) receptor differ depending upon the response measured, and they support the hypothesis that different drugs, acting at the same receptor subtype, can differentially regulate multiple cellular signaling systems.", 
    "3": "Propofol has been shown to protect against neuronal damage induced by brain ischaemia in small animal models. We reported previously that mild hypothermia (33 degrees C) in combination with extracorporeal lung and heart assist (ECLHA) improved the neurological outcome in dogs with cardiac arrest (CA) of 15 min induced during normothermia. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of propofol infusion under mild hypothermia with ECLHA in this model.", 
    "4": "Twenty-one female dogs (15 mongrel dogs and 6 beagles) were divided into three groups: Midazolam 0.1 mg/(kg h) infusion group (M, n=7), Propofol 2 mg/(kg h) infusion group (P2, n=7), Propofol 4 mg/(kg h) infusion group (P4, n=7). Normothermic ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in all dogs for 15 min, followed by brief ECLHA and 168 h of intensive care. The drug infusion was initiated at a constant rate after the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to 24 h. Mild hypothermia (33 degrees C) was maintained for 20 h. Neurological deficit scores (NDS: 0%=normal, 100%=brain death) were evaluated for neurological function from 33 to 168 h.", 
    "5": "One dog in the M group died, and the remaining dogs survived for 168 h. The P4 group showed better neurological recovery compared with the M group (48 h, 21+/-16% versus 32+/-15%; 72 h, 7+/-6% versus 25+/-11%; 96 h, 6+/-6% versus 21+/-6%; 120 h, 5+/-5% versus 20+/-6%; 144 h, 4+/-4% versus 20+/-6%; 168 h, 4+/-4% versus 20+/-6%, p<0.05). One dog in the P2 and three dogs in the P4 group achieved full neurological recovery (NDS: 0%). The number of intact pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 was greater in the propofol groups than midazolam group (p<0.05).", 
    "6": "The combination of propofol infusion at a rate of 4 mg/(kg h), 24h and rapidly induced mild hypothermia (33 degrees C) with ECLHA might provide a successful means of cerebral resuscitation from CA.", 
    "7": "Schizophrenia is a devastating illness of unknown etiology and the basis for its treatment rests in the symptomatic response to antipsychotics. It was found that some of the patients with schizophrenia elicited microglia activation. The present study used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse microglial cell line N9 as an in vitro model to mimic microglia activation seen in the patients with schizophrenia. The effects of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol on the release of nitric oxide (NO) by LPS-stimulated N9 cells were investigated. The results showed that olanzapine significantly inhibited NO release by LPS-stimulated N9 cells. Clozapine and haloperidol did not show significant effects on this model. The present study suggested that the inhibiting effect of olanzapine on the NO release by LPS-stimulated microglial cells might be a new mechanism through which olanzapine exhibits its therapeutic effect in the treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "8": "Creatine kinase is an important enzyme in the energy metabolism of many cell types, including muscle cells. Increased serum levels of creatine kinase may serve as a marker of enhanced creatine kinase synthesis in muscle cells or muscle cell membrane damage. The purpose of this study was to compare serum creatine kinase levels in chronic psychosis patients treated with either atypical or conventional antipsychotics. Forty-nine patients, receiving clozapine (n=18), or olanzapine (n=18), or conventional agents (n=13), were studied. Fasting serum samples were analyzed for creatine kinase. A significant difference in median creatine kinase level was found among the treatment groups (p=0.03), in that the creatine kinase level was higher both in the patients receiving clozapine and in the patients receiving olanzapine, compared to that in patients receiving conventional antipsychotics, p=0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively. In addition, elevated creatine kinase levels above the upper limit of normal were found in 6 (17%) of the patients treated with clozapine or olanzapine, but in none of the patients treated with conventional agents. In summary, the present results indicate that therapy with atypical antipsychotics like clozapine and olanzapine, in contrast to conventional agents, may be associated with serum creatine kinase elevation.", 
    "9": "Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with poor functional outcome, and may be further aggravated by treatment with antipsychotics. In the present study the acute and chronic (3 weeks of treatment) effects of clozapine, olanzapine, and sertindole on performance in the Morris water maze in rats was compared, using pharmacologically and/or clinically relevant dose regimens. An experimental design consisting of three trials/day over 3 days was used. Performance was expressed as the distance and latency to find a submerged platform, as well as the percentage of \"non-finders\", i.e. percentage of trials where the rat was unable to find the platform within the total trial time of 60 s. Clozapine (40 mg/kg, p.o.) and olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) impaired water maze performance when given acutely. However, tolerance developed to the deficit induced by clozapine, whereas the olanzapine-mediated impairment was enhanced after chronic treatment. Sertindole (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) had no disruptive effect on performance after either acute or chronic treatment. Exposure measurements confirmed that all three compounds were present in the serum at least at clinically effective concentrations. Thus, the three antipsychotics tested differentially affected rodent cognition, whereby sertindole appeared to have a lower potential than either clozapine or olanzapine to induce cognitive impairment. The hypothesis that the low potency of sertindole in inducing dopamine D2 receptor blockade, combined with lack of antimuscarinic and histamine H1 antagonist activity in vivo is discussed. Clearly further studies are needed to assess the potential cognition-enhancing effects of sertindole vs. other antipsychotics in a relevant animal model of schizophrenia.", 
    "10": "Fenobam [N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N'-(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4-oxo-1H-imidazole-2-yl)urea], a clinically validated non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, has been shown to be a potent and non-competitive metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)-5 receptor antagonist. In the present study, we have used the site-directed mutagenesis coupled with three-dimensional receptor-based pharmacophore modelling to elucidate the interacting mode of fenobam within the seven-transmembrane domain (7TMD) of mGlu5 receptor and its comparison with that of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), the prototype antagonist. The common residues involved in the recognition of MPEP and fenobam include Pro654(3.36), Tyr658(3.40), Thr780(6.44), Trp784(6.48), Phe787(6.51), Tyr791(6.55) and Ala809(7.47). The differentiating residues between both modulators' interacting modes are Arg647(3.29), Ser657(3.39) and Leu743(5.47). Our data suggest that these chemically unrelated mGlu5 antagonists act similarly, probing a functionally unique region of the 7TMD. Using [3H]inositol phosphates accumulation assay, we have also identified the critical residues involved in the inverse agonist effect of MPEP. The mutation W784(6.48)A completely blocked the inverse agonist activity of MPEP; two mutations F787(6.51)A and Y791(6.55)A, caused a drastic decrease in the MPEP inverse agonism. Furthermore, these three mutations led to an increased efficacy of quisqualate without having any effect on its potency. The fact that the residues Trp784(6.48) and Phe787(6.51) are essential equally in antagonism and inverse agonism effects emphasizes again the key role of these residues and the involvement of a common transmembrane network in receptor inactivation by MPEP.", 
    "11": "Suicide by self-poisoning is a prevalent cause of death worldwide. A substantial proportion of individuals who poison themselves come into contact with medical services before they die. Our focus in the current study was the medical management of drug self-poisoning in industrialized countries and its possible contribution to suicide prevention. We reviewed the literature to determine the proportion of self-poisoning suicides who reach hospital alive, the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of in-hospital overdose deaths, the in-hospital management this group of patients receives, and whether there are specific aspects of pre-hospital care and in-hospital management that have the potential to improve survival. Between 11% and 28% of individuals who died following deliberate ingestion of drugs reached hospital alive. The substances which were most frequently implicated in death were paracetamol (acetaminophen) and paracetamol compounds, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines. Most patients received fairly intensive treatment, yet death may have been preventable in a small proportion of cases. Only one intervention (the administration of acetylcysteine) was shown to reduce mortality and this was in a highly selected group of patients (those who had ingested paracetamol and developed fulminant hepatic failure). It is possible that other interventions such as better airway management, the prompt administration of activated charcoal, and improved pre-hospital care may improve outcomes but their potential contribution to suicide prevention needs to be investigated in future studies.", 
    "12": "The purpose of this prospective, pilot study was to investigate postsedation events during the first 24 hours after discharge from the treatment facility in children sedated for dental treatment.", 
    "13": "This prospective study involved a convenience sample of 30 healthy patients, ranging from 2 to 5 years of age, who were scheduled to undergo sedation in the dental clinic for operative procedures. Depending on the extent of dental need, child temperament, and other preoperative assessment variables, the children received either a triple combination of chloral hydrate, meperidine, and hydroxyzine ranging in dose from 20 to 30 mg/kg, 1 to 2 mg/kg, 1 to 2 mg/kg, respectively, or midazolam alone (0.5-0.75 mg/kg). Care was provided consistent with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) and hospital sedation guidelines. Parents were given a questionnaire concerning events that may occur during the 24 hours after the sedation and were told they would be interviewed via telephone regarding these events. The principal investigator called 24 hours after the sedation visit and interviewed the parents using the questionnaire given to the parents. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, frequency, and chi-square analysis.", 
    "14": "Data from 30 sedations were used. Differences were noted between a chloral hydrate, meperidine, and hydroxyzine regimen compared to midazolam alone for incidence of sleep on the way home or shortly after arriving at home, but not for postoperative pain, vomiting, eating, evening sleep, and memory. Those receiving the combination regimen were more likely to sleep on the way to and at home than those who received midazolam alone.", 
    "15": "It may be concluded that: (1) opportunities for the occurrence of an adverse event may occur on the way or at home following a sedation appointment; and (2) discharge criteria of the AAPD guidelines on elective use of minimal, moderate, or deep sedation and general anesthesia for pediatric dental patients should be met or exceeded as a precautionary measure to prevent adverse events once a child who has received sedative agents leaves a health care facility.", 
    "16": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon but sometimes fatal complication of neuroleptics and other medications that involve the central dopaminergic system. Many diagnostic criteria have been proposed for NMS but because of its variable presentation, universal criteria have not been established yet. Hyperthermia, disturbances of consciousness, extrapyramidal and autonomic symptoms are common features of NMS. We report the case of a 36 years old woman suffering from chronic schizophrenia and treated with flufenazine and olanzapine, who presented with series of generalised tonic-clonic seizures as the acute onset of recurrent malignant neuroleptic syndrome. Although atypical neuroleptics were previously thought to have less risk for MNS, combination of conventional and atypical neuroleptics in therapy increases the risk of NMS development and olanzapine might be responsible for the epileptic manifestations at the onset of fulminant NMS.",

They were followed over 6 months with the primary outcome measure being treatment failure (either discontinuation or modification of AEDs) due to either adverse effects or breakthrough seizures.", 
    "21": "Treatment failures were noted to be significantly less common (P =0.03) in the clobazam-treated group (n=1; 4.7%) than in phenytoin-treated group (n=9; 33.3%). These included one patient (4.7%) in the clobazam-group who had breakthrough seizures and 3 (11.1%) who had breakthrough seizures and 6 (22.2%) in the phenytoin-treated group who had adverse effects requiring treatment discontinuation.",

    "23": "The biarylpropylsulfonamide class of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) potentiators represented by N-2-(4-(4-cyanophenol)phenol)propyl-2-propanesulfonamide (LY404187) and (R)-4'-[1-fluoro-1-methyl-2-(propane-2-sulfonylamino)-ethyl]-biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid methylamide (LY503430) are positive, allosteric AMPA receptor activators, which enhance AMPA receptor-mediated neurotransmission by reducing desensitization of the ion channel. Although these compounds have efficacy in in vivo rodent models of cognition, depression, and Parkinson's disease, little is known about biochemical pathways activated by these agents. Given the well established regulation of the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway by excitatory neurotransmission, the current study characterized AMPA receptor potentiator-mediated cGMP response in mouse cerebellum. Acute treatment by both LY404187 and LY503430 [2.0, 5.0, or 10 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)] elevated basal cerebellar cGMP levels in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with the noncompetitive, allosteric AMPA receptor-selective antagonist 7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine-7-carboxamide, 5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-N,8-dimethyl-monohydrochloride-(9CI) (GYKI 53655) [3.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)], completely blocked the effect of LY404187, demonstrating that activation of AMPA receptors induces cGMP levels. Interestingly, pretreatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) open channel blocker dizocilpine (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg i.p.) also abolished the AMPA receptor potentiator-mediated cGMP accumulation, indicating that activation of AMPA receptors leads to NMDA receptor-mediated transmission involved in cGMP regulation. Pharmacological augmentation of the endogenous glutamate tone via the alkaloid harmaline (20-60 mg/kg i.p.) synergized with AMPA potentiator activity and provided further direct evidence of in vivo allosteric activation of AMPA receptors by LY404187. The synergism between harmaline and LY404187 was specific, since cGMP accumulation induced by foot-shock stress was not augmented by the AMPA receptor potentiator. Taken together, these data indicate that the cGMP system may play an important role in pharmacological efficacy of the biarylpropylsulfonamide class of AMPA receptor potentiators.", 
    "24": "Brain death diagnosis may be confounded by centrally acting drugs. The certainty of brain death diagnosis can be enhanced by demonstrating that the concentrations of such drugs are well below the therapeutic range. A combined high-performance liquid chromatography-based method was developed for the benzodiazepines midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, diazepam, and nordiazepam and for the barbiturates thiopentone and pentobarbitone in serum or plasma of critically ill patients. The lower limits of detection of the assays for benzodiazepines and barbiturates were 2.5 ng/mL and 0.05 microg/mL. The lower limits of the working ranges of these assays were set at 25 ng/mL and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively, and are below the lowest pharmacologically active plasma concentrations of these drugs. Intra- and interday coefficients of variations were less than 2.5% and 11.0% throughout, as determined with six replicates (n = 6). These assays were accurate in that the relative difference between actually measured and expected concentration never exceeded 12%. Utilization of these assays will render the diagnosis of brain death more reliable.",

    "26": "A randomised controlled trial was conducted, incorporating a cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal as well as a pharmaceutical perspective. The cost of intervention treatment, prescribed drugs, healthcare services, productivity loss, and patients' costs were measured using drug prescription data and cost diaries. Costs were indexed at 2001 prices. The principal outcome was the proportion of patients able to discontinue benzodiazepine use during the 18-month follow-up. A secondary outcome measure was quality of life (Health Utility Index Mark III [HUI-3] and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]).", 
    "27": "A total of 180 patients were randomised to one of TO+CBT (n = 73), TOA (n = 73) or usual care (n = 34). Intervention treatment costs were an average of 172.99Euro per patient for TO+CBT and 69.50Euro per patient for TOA. Both treatment conditions significantly reduced benzodiazepine costs during follow-up compared with usual care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) showed that, for each incremental 1% successful benzodiazepine discontinuation, TO+CBT cost 10.30-62.53Euro versus usual care, depending on the study perspective. However, TO+CBT was extendedly dominated or was dominated by TOA. This resulted in ICERs of 0.57Euro, 10.21Euro and 48.92Euro for TOA versus usual care from the limited pharmaceutical, comprehensive pharmaceutical and societal perspective, respectively.", 
    "28": "TO+CBT and TOA both led to a reduction in benzodiazepine costs. However, it remains uncertain which healthcare utilisation has a causal relationship with long-term benzodiazepine consumption or its treatment. Although the ICERs indicated better cost effectiveness for TOA than for TO+CBT, the differences were relatively small. The addition of group CBT to tapering off had no clinical or economic advantages. Extrapolation of our data showed that the investment in TOA was paid back after 19 months when corrected for treatment gain with usual care.", 
    "29": "Effects of hyperthermia-induced seizures (HS) on GABA(A) and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in immature rat brain were evaluated using in vitro autoradiography. HS were induced in 10-days-old rats by a regulated stream of moderately heated air directed 50 cm above the animals. Rats were killed 30 min, 24 h or 20 days after HS and their brains were used for in vitro autoradiography experiments to determine GABA(A) and BDZ receptor binding. GABA(A) binding was significantly enhanced in all brain areas evaluated 30 min after HS, an effect that endures 24 h and 20 days after seizures. Concerning BDZ receptor binding, a significant increase was detected in entorhinal and perirhinal cortices and decreased in basolateral amygdala 30 min following HS. One day after HS, animals demonstrated enhanced BDZ binding in the cingulate, frontal, posterior parietal, entorhinal, temporal and perirhinal cortices; striatum, accumbens, substantia nigra pars compacta and amygdala nuclei. Twenty days after HS enhanced BDZ binding was restricted in the cingulated, frontal, anterior and posterior parietal cortices, as well as in substantia nigra pars reticulata, whereas decreased values were found in accumbens nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta. Our data indicate differential effects of HS in GABA(A) and BDZ binding in immature brain. HS-induced GABA(A) and BDZ changes are different from those previously described in experimental models of temporal lobe epilepsy in adult animals.",

Although naloxone failed to alter the behaviour of C57 mice, both doses of this antagonist produced behaviourally selective reductions in open-arm avoidance in 129 mice. Surprisingly, none of the more selective opioid receptor antagonists replicated this effect of naloxone: beta-funaltrexamine was devoid of behavioural activity, naltrindole suppressed rearing (all doses) and increased immobility (10 mg/kg), while nor-binaltorphimine (5 mg/kg) nonspecifically increased percent open arm entries.",

In this report, we provide detailed information on psychotropic use among patients with unipolar depression participating in a large, multisite electroconculsive therapy (ECT) study. Adequacy of antidepressant medication trials was assessed with the Antidepressant Treatment History Form. Among patients with nonpsychotic depression, 27% (60/220) had not had an adequate trial of an antidepressant before ECT, and 63% (139/220) had had at least one inadequate trial. Surprisingly, 33% (79/243) of nonpsychotic patients had been prescribed an antipsychotic. Among patients with psychotic depression, 95% (101/106) had not been given an adequate combination of an antidepressant and antipsychotic agent, mostly due to low doses of the latter class. Among all patients in the trial, 61% (213/352) had been prescribed at least one benzodiazepine, and only 7% (24/352) had been given a lithium augmentation trial. Use of hypnotic agents and anticonvulsants was common. In conclusion, patients with severe depression referred for ECT with a unipolar depressive episode have high rates of psychotropic usage, much of which is inadequate.", 
    "41": "Functional interactions between presynaptic adenosine and acetylcholine (ACh) autoreceptors were studied at the frog neuromuscular junction by recording miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) during bath or local application of agonists. The frequency of MEPPs was reduced by adenosine acting on presynaptic adenosine A1 receptors (EC(50) = 1.1 microm) or by carbachol acting on muscarinic M2 receptors (EC(50) = 1.8 microm). However, carbachol did not produce the depressant effect when it was applied after the action of adenosine had reached its maximum. This phenomenon implied that the negative cross-talk (occlusion) had occurred between A1 and M2 receptors. Moreover, the occlusion was receptor-specific as ATP applied in the presence of adenosine continued to depress MEPP frequency. Muscarinic antagonists [atropine or 1-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) (AFDX-116)] had no effect on the inhibitory action of adenosine and adenosine antagonists [8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-SPT) or 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX)] had no effect on the action of carbachol. These data suggested that membrane-delimited interactions did not occur between A1 and M2 receptors. Both carbachol and adenosine similarly inhibited quantal release triggered by high potassium, ionomycin or sucrose. These results indicated a convergence of intracellular pathways activated by M2 and A1 receptors to a common presynaptic effector located downstream of Ca(2+) influx. We propose that the negative cross-talk between two major autoreceptors could take place during intense synaptic activity and thereby attenuate the presynaptic inhibitory effects of ACh and adenosine.", 
    "42": "Subjective reports of sleep disturbance indicate that 70-91% of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have difficulty falling or staying asleep. Nightmares are reported by 19-71% of patients, depending on the severity of their PTSD and their exposure to physical aggression. Objective measures of sleep disturbance are inconsistent, with some studies that used these measures indicating poor sleep and others finding no differences compared with non-PTSD controls. Future research in this area may benefit from examining measures of instability in the microstructure of sleep. Additionally, recent findings suggest that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep movement disorders are more common in patients with PTSD than in the general population and that these disorders may contribute to the brief awakenings, insomnia and daytime fatigue in patients with PTSD. Overall, sleep problems have an impact on the development and symptom severity of PTSD and on the quality of life and functioning of patients. In terms of treatments, SSRIs are commonly used to treat PTSD, and evidence suggests that they have a small but significant positive effect on sleep disruption. Studies of serotonin-potentiating non-SSRIs suggest that nefazodone and trazodone lead to significant reductions in insomnia and nightmares, whereas cyproheptadine may exacerbate sleep problems in patients with PTSD. Prazosin, a centrally acting alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, has led to large reductions in nightmares and insomnia in small studies of patients with PTSD. Augmentation of SSRIs with olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, may be effective for treatment-resistant nightmares and insomnia, although adverse effects can be significant. Additional medications, including zolpidem, buspirone, gabapentin and mirtazapine, have been found to improve sleep in patients with PTSD. Large randomised, placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm the above findings. In contrast, evidence suggests that benzodiazepines, TCAs and MAOIs are not useful for the treatment of PTSD-related sleep disorders, and their adverse effect profiles make further studies unlikely. Cognitive behavioural interventions for sleep disruption in patients with PTSD include strategies targeting insomnia and imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) for nightmares. One large randomised controlled trial of group IRT demonstrated significant reductions in nightmares and insomnia. Similarly, uncontrolled studies combining IRT and insomnia strategies have demonstrated good outcomes. Uncontrolled studies of continuous positive airway pressure for SDB in patients with PTSD show that this treatment led to significant decreases in nightmares, insomnia and PTSD symptoms. Controlled studies are needed to confirm these promising findings.",

A combination of fentanyl citrate and midazolam hydrochloride, based on the patient's body weight, was intravenously administered until the patient was drowsy and tranquil. The adverse events associated with this moderate sedation were assessed. The visual analog scale format was used to measure the subjective feelings of the patient's pre-procedural anxiety and intraprocedural pain.",

The mean total dose per kilogram of body weight of midazolam was 0.035 mg in PTBD, PTGBD, AD, PCN, DJS, GS and RFA, 0.039 mg in TDC, and 0.043 mg in BS. A temporary reduction of systolic blood pressure to less than 80 mmHg was observed during 5 procedures (6.9%), whereas a temporary elevation of systolic blood pressure above 150 mmHg was observed during 10 procedures (13.8%). A reduction of arterial oxygen saturation to less than 90% was observed during 14 procedures (19.4%). None of the patients required pharmacologic reversal agents or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The mean anxiety score recorded before all procedures was 5.2 (distressing). The mean pain score during the procedure, which was recorded after all procedures, was 2.9 (mild).",

The International Restless Legs Syndrome Group has recently developed the criteria for diagnosis of PLMD in children. These criteria include both specific clinical features and polysomnographic findings. Exclusion of other causes especially sleep-disordered breathing is essential. Several medications including benzodiazepine and dopaminergic medication have been used in children, although these medications have not been adequately studied in this age group. Some PLMD children have evidence of low iron storage and response favorably to iron therapy.", 
    "48": "TOT states may be viewed as a temporary and reversible microamnesia. We investigated the effects of lorazepam on TOT states in response to general knowledge questions. The lorazepam participants produced more commission errors and more TOTs following commission errors than the placebo participants (although the rates did not change). The resolution of the TOTs was unimpaired by the drug. Neither feeling-of-knowing accuracy nor recognition were affected by lorazepam. The higher level of incorrect recalls produced by lorazepam participants may be due to the fact that they were more frequently temporarily unable to access a known item. For some of these items, the awareness of the retrieval failure resulted in a commission TOT (phenonemological TOT after a commission error). The resolution of the TOT conflict is discussed in the light of the anxiolytic and anticonflict effects of lorazepam. The data are discussed in terms of contemporary theories of TOTs and the effects that benzodiazepines have on semantic memory.", 
    "49": "Approximately 60% of patients with a first episode of psychosis will significantly reduce the severity of their positive symptomatology with antipsychotic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of response to antipsychotic treatment during the first episode of non-affective psychosis. 172 patients (107 male) with a diagnosis of schizophreniform, schizophrenia, schizoaffective, brief reactive psychosis, schizotypal personality disorder or psychosis non-otherwise specified entered the study. Sociodemographic, premorbid and clinical data at baseline were evaluated. Unpaired t-test for continuous and chi2 for categorical data, respectively, were used to compare responders and non-responders selected variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to establish a prediction model. 57.6% of study subjects (99 of 172) responded to antipsychotic treatment. The following variables were significantly associated with less likelihood of response: 1.--lower severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms and disorganized symptoms at baseline; 2.--earlier age of onset; 3.--diagnosis of schizophrenia; 4.--longer DUP; 5.--poorer premorbid adjustment during adolescence, and 6.--hospitalization. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that differences between responders and non-responders were largely accounted for by BPRS total score, age of onset, premorbid adjustment at early adolescence, and diagnosis. Patients with an early age of onset of schizophrenia, a poor premorbid adolescent functioning, and with a lower severity of psychopathology at intake seem to have a decrease likelihood of responding to antipsychotic treatment. Helping clinicians to identify non-responders is meant as a first step to optimise therapeutic effort to benefit individuals in this vulnerable group.", 
    "50": "The peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the major neurotransmitters modulating satiety, nociception, and anxiety behavior. Although many behavioral studies showing anti-analgesic and anxiogenic actions of CCK have been reported, less is known about its cellular action in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, we examined the action of CCK in rat dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons using slice preparations and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Application of CCK-8S produced an inward current accompanied by increased spontaneous synaptic activities. The CCK-8S-induced inward current (I(CCK)) was recovered after washout and reproduced by multiple exposures. Current-voltage plots revealed that I(CCK) reversed near the equilibrium potential for K(+) ions with a decreased membrane conductance. When several K(+) channel blockers were used, application of CdCl(2), TEA, or apamin significantly reduced I(CCK). I(CCK) was also significantly reduced by the CCK(2) receptor antagonist, L-365,260, while it was not affected by the CCK(1) receptor antagonist, L-364,718. Furthermore, we examined the effects of CCK-8S on miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in order to determine the mechanism of CCK-mediated increase on synaptic activities. We found that CCK-8S increased the frequency of mEPSCs, but had no effect on mEPSC amplitude. This presynaptic effect persisted in the presence of CdCl(2) or Ca(2+)-free bath solution, but was completely abolished by pre-treatment with BAPTA-AM, thapsigargin or L-365,260. Taken together, our results indicate that CCK can excite PAG neurons at both pre- and postsynaptic loci via the activation of CCK(2) receptors. These effects may be important for the effects of CCK on behavior and autonomic function that are mediated via PAG neurons.", 
    "51": "A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nitrates are better than benzodiazepines in the treatment of cocaine induced chest pain. Seven citations were reviewed of which two answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that in patients with cocaine induced chest pain it appears that nitrates or benzodiazepines are effective in combination or alone in resolving chest pain and improving cardiac performance. We recommend that the agent of choice may be influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent CNS symptoms.", 
    "52": "Antidepressant medications have eased the suffering of millions of people. In addition to treating depression, antidepressant drugs also treat several anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, there are problematic limitations with antidepressant agents, including a delayed therapeutic response and insufficient efficacy. Emerging evidence shows that atypical antipsychotic agents can be used as augmentation therapy in patients with poor responses to antidepressants. Future drugs combining key features of antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic agents could offer new promise for patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and depression.", 
    "53": "Previous studies have reported loss of clonazepam from solutions administered intravenously from plastic infusion bags and administration sets. In palliative care, clonazepam is sometimes administered through syringe drivers using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) infusion tubing. No data currently exist to show whether use of PVC tubing affects the amount of clonazepam actually received by the patient. This study compared the use of two different types of PVC tubing with a non-PVC tubing. Solutions containing clonazepam or clonazepam and morphine were prepared with either normal saline or water for injection as diluent. Concentrations of morphine and clonazepam were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Significant loss of clonazepam (up to 50%) was observed in all solutions infused through PVC tubing. Solutions infused through non-PVC tubing retained greater than 90% of the initial concentration of clonazepam. It is recommended that when administering clonazepam using a syringe driver, non-PVC tubing be used.",

    "55": "A Markov model was built around the 3 health states of euthymia, mania, and depression. The base-case model simulates a cohort of 1,000 patients with BD-I who have recently stabilized after resolution of a bipolar mania episode. The cohort was modeled for a period of 18 months. Resource-use estimates were derived from best available published data, treatment guidelines, a physician survey, and published unit cost data. Outputs were measured in terms of costs per acute mood episode avoided, costs per euthymic day gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Direct health care payer costs are used in the analyses.", 
    "56": "The base-case model for patients with a recent manic episode indicated that lamotrigine is the most effective treatment for avoiding both acute depression episodes and all types of acute episodes (depression and mania). It is also the most effective treatment in terms of number of euthymic days achieved (309 days per patient per year). Olanzapine is most effective for avoiding acute mania episodes. Total direct costs of treatment are lowest for the lithium treatment arm (Dollars 8,710 per patient for the 18-month period). All maintenance therapies were cost effective compared with the no-maintenance (acute-only treatment) arm. In the base case, lamotrigine had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Dollars 30 per euthymic day and Dollars 2,400 per acute episode avoided compared with lithium. A QALY analysis indicated that lamotrigine is cost effective in patients with a recent manic episode at Dollars 26,000 per QALY. The base-case model indicated that lamotrigine dominates olanzapine, (that is, lamotrigine costs less and is more effective than olanzapine) in patients with a recent manic episode. In a sensitivity analysis using outcomes from the pivotal trial of recently depressed patients, lamotrigine, in comparison with lithium, was not shown to be as cost effective as in the recently manic patients, but it was still cost effective compared with no maintenance treatment.", 
    "57": "For a defined cohort of patients with BD-I, the pharmacoeconomic model indicated that prevention of mood episodes with lithium and lamotrigine is cost effective in patients with a recent manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode. The conclusions with respect to the indirect comparison with olanzapine should be validated if and when direct trial data become available. Cost-effectiveness of maintenance treatments for patients with BD-I (recently depressed as well as recently manic) are likely to improve in models with a broader costing perspective and that take a longer time frame. Further research into the outcome implications of health-related quality of life and other BD subgroups are recommended.",

In order to determine the importance of this practice and the characteristics of these consumers, a study has been carried out, based on data from the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur and Corsica health reimbursement system. Individuals from these regions affiliated to the French health reimbursement system, who have had a prescription of clonazepam reimbursed between January 1, 2001 and February 15, 2001, have been selected. The deliveries have been monitored over a 9 month-period. 9381 subjects have been selected. A sub-group of 1.5 per cent subjects with a deviant behaviour has been identified by factorial analysis and has been compared to the sub-group without deviant behaviour. The subjects with deviant behaviour are younger and mostly male. The dosage of clonazepam is higher (10.8 mg per day versus 2.1 mg per day) with a significantly higher proportion of benzodiazepine and high-dose buprenorphine. The number of deliveries is higher (19.4 versus 5.9) as well as the number of different physicians (4.5 versus 1.5) and pharmacies (5.9 versus 1.3). This study provides some arguments in favor of the potential of abuse and dependence of clonazepam and the necessity to reinforce its monitoring.

    "59": "Pharmacoepidemiological studies exploring utilisation of psychotropic medications in real-life conditions are required to identify extension of indications, since the risk of gap between the theoretical target population and the population actually treated is especially marked for this class of drugs. A large proportion of subjects from the general population are exposed to psychotropic medications, so even a small increase in the risk of adverse effect may have major deleterious consequences for the health of the general population. Hence, pharmacoepidemiological studies are also required to explore the risk/benefit ratio of these drugs in real-life conditions. These studies may provide answers to currently unsolved public health questions, such as the long-term cognitive impact of exposure to benzodiazepines, the impact of antidepressant on suicidal behaviour, or the risks associated with enlarged use of antipsychotics. Only findings obtained by such studies may allow risk management and elaboration of guidelines based upon factual data.", 
    "60": "Delirium remains a non recognized, but highly prevalent, form of organ dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU). Intensive care physicians have begun to benefit from elucidation of risk factors for delirium in the ICU, some of which are modifiable, whereas others are not. In the last 5 years, a new tool for use in detecting delirium among critically ill patients has been adapted, validated, and found objectively reliable for use at the bedside by nonpsychiatrists. Moreover, that tool-the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU)-has enabled determination of the serious sequelae of delirium, including increased mortality, higher cost, longer length of hospital stay, failure of extubation, and burdensome long-term cognitive impairment. Although prevention and treatment options exist, little data guide current pharmacological approaches to delirium, and nonpharmacological approaches have yet to be fully adopted by ICUs. Ongoing trials will address some of these limitations, but large cohort studies within the ICU are needed to further clarify risk factors and to identify targets to modify the occurrence and course of delirium. Furthermore, consideration of a continuum may better elucidate the true magnitude of acute brain dysfunction in the ICU.",

    "62": "Apparent intrinsic clearance (CL(int,app)) of 7-ethoxycoumarin, phenacetin, propranolol, and midazolam was measured using rat and human liver microsomes and freshly isolated and cryopreserved hepatocytes to determine factors responsible for differences in rates of metabolism in these systems. The cryopreserved and freshly isolated hepatocytes generally provided similar results, although there was greater variability using the latter system. The CL(int,app) values in hepatocytes are observed to be lower than that in microsomes, and this difference becomes greater for compounds with high CL(int,app). This could partly be attributed to the differences in the free fraction (fu). The fu in hepatocyte incubations (fu,hep-inc) was influenced not only by the free fraction of compounds in the incubation buffer (fu,buffer) but also by the rate constants of uptake (k(up)) and metabolism (k(met)). This report provides a new derivation for fu,hep-inc, which can be expressed as fu,hep-inc = [k(up)/(k(met) + k(up))]/[1 + (C(hep)/C(buffer)) x (V(hep)/V(buffer))], where the C(hep), C(buffer), V(hep), and V(buffer) represent the concentrations of a compound in hepatocytes and buffer and volumes of hepatocytes and buffer, respectively. For midazolam, the fu,hep-inc was calculated, and the maximum metabolism rate in hepatocytes was shown to be limited by the uptake rate.", 
    "63": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting up to 3-15% of the general population in Western countries. It is characterised by unexplained abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating in association with altered bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS is considered to be multifactorial, involving disturbances of the brain-gut-axis: IBS has been associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor functions, visceral hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, autonomic dysfunction and mucosal inflammation. Traditional IBS therapy is mainly symptom oriented and often unsatisfactory. Hence, there is a need for new treatment strategies. Increasing knowledge of brain-gut physiology, mechanisms, and neurotransmitters and receptors involved in gastrointestinal motor and sensory function have led to the development of several new therapeutic approaches. This article provides a systematic overview of recently approved or novel medications that show promise for the treatment of IBS; classification is based on the physiological systems targeted by the medication. The article includes agents acting on the serotonin receptor or serotonin transporter system, novel selective anticholinergics, alpha-adrenergic agonists, opioid agents, cholecystokinin antagonists, neurokinin antagonists, somatostatin receptor agonists, neurotrophin-3, corticotropin releasing factor antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase-c agonists, melatonin and atypical benzodiazepines.

We also review risks associated with several classes of medications: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergic medications. They are associated with adverse outcomes when taken by older adults and should be used with caution. We also address the use of opioid medications in seniors. Although they are not without risk, opioids are generally safe with slow titration, precautions, and a bowel regimen to prevent constipation. Prescribers should also consider the need for estimating creatinine clearance when prescribing medications that require dosage adjustment in the setting of renal insufficiency.

On general medical hospital wards, withdrawal may be affected by comorbid medical illness. A clinical trial was undertaken to determine whether there is a difference between symptom-triggered (ST) and fixed-schedule (FS) dosing of lorazepam in patients hospitalized on general medical wards at a university medical center. One hundred eighty-three subjects were assessed by their nurses with the Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale. Subjects in the ST arm received lorazepam doses based on CIWA-Ar score. Subjects in the FS arm received scheduled lorazepam with tapering over 4 days.

    "68": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of diazepam and the pro-diazepam avizafone in preventing the severity of soman-induced pathology in guinea pig. Survival, respiration and seizures of experimental animals were investigated with on-line monitoring of respiratory and EEG parameters. Guinea pigs were pretreated with pyridostigmine (0.1mg/kg i.m.) and 30 min later challenged with 1 or 2 LD50 soman. One minute after intoxication they were treated with atropine (3 or 33.8 mg/kg), pralidoxime chloride (32 mg/kg) and either diazepam (2 mg/kg), avizafone (3.5 mg/kg) or saline solution. The highest dose of atropine (33.8 mg/kg) gave a protective effect in groups treated without anticonvulsants by reducing the severity of clinical signs and death within 24 h but also by decreasing seizure occurrence and brain injuries. When injected at the similar molar dose of 7 micromoles/kg, the protection of anticonvulsants against soman neurotoxicity was higher with the atropine/pralidoxime/avizafone combination than with atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam. Indeed, when atropine was used at the lowest dose, avizafone was found to prevent early mortality and seizures occurrence with better efficacy than diazepam. On the other hand, when added to the therapy, the both anticonvulsants did not prevent the moderate EEG depression (reduction of amplitude by 30-52%) observed under 2 LD50 soman. Moreover, the number of animals suffering from respiratory distress (defined as a decrease of minute ventilation of more than 20% from the baseline value) was enhanced when diazepam or avizafone were used in the therapy. This effect was dependent on the atropine dose and the nature of the anticonvulsant. The beneficial effects of the different therapeutics tested were assessed and compared to the previous data obtained with the same therapies against sarin and from the pharmacokinetics properties of the atropine/diazepam mixture.", 
    "69": "The neural mechanisms underlying anxiety states are believed to involve interactions among forebrain limbic circuits and brainstem serotonergic systems. Consistent with this hypothesis, FG-7142, a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine allosteric site of the GABAA receptor, increases c-Fos expression within a subpopulation of brainstem serotonergic neurons. Paradoxically, FG-7142 has no effect on extracellular serotonin concentrations, as measured using in vivo microdialysis, in certain anxiety-related brain structures. This study tested the hypothesis that FG-7142 alters serotonin metabolism within one or more nodes of a defined anxiety-related forebrain circuit. Rats received one of four treatments (vehicle, 1.9, 3.8, or 7.5 mg/kg FG-7142, i.p.) and brains were collected 1 h following treatment. Thirteen forebrain regions were microdissected and analyzed for l-tryptophan, serotonin, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations using high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. FG-7142 (7.5 mg/kg) increased l-tryptophan, serotonin, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in the prelimbic cortex but not in several other regions studied including subdivisions of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These data demonstrate that FG-7142 alters brain tryptophan concentrations and serotonin metabolism in specific components of an anxiety-related forebrain circuit including the medial prefrontal cortex, an important structure involved in executive function and the regulation of emotional behavior.", 
    "70": "Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic, approved for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. Despite the publicity regarding reported adverse events with the novel antipsychotics, such as weight gain and Type II diabetes mellitus, olanzapine remains a useful and important medicine. It is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high-affinity binding to a number of receptors thought to be implicated in some psychotic and mood symptoms. The complex pharmacology of olanzapine has lead to studies exploring its use in treating substance abuse, aggression/violence, borderline personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and as a neuroprotective agent in schizophrenia. As the pharmacology of olanzapine and other novel antipsychotics becomes better understood, future effective treatment strategies are likely to match an individual's genetic makeup and receptor profiles to the most compatible agent.", 
    "71": "A 3D pharmacophore model predicting anticonvulsant activity was obtained for a series of 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives recently disclosed as a new class of noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists. The training set included 17 compounds with varying potency against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice. The best statistical hypothesis, generated with the HypoGen module of Catalyst 4.9, consisted of five features: two hydrogen bond acceptors, two hydrophobic features, and one hydrophobic aromatic region, providing a model with a correlation coefficient of 0.919. The obtained model was an efficient tool in the design of some new anticonvulsant agents containing the tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold. Moreover, in order to explain the different degree of efficacy of the newly designed N-substituted derivatives, excluded volumes were also considered.", 
    "72": "Risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine are three atypical antipsychotic medications commonly used in the management of chronic schizophrenia. While they offer advantages with regard to clinical efficacy and side-effect profile, few studies have compared them in a naturalistic prospective observational manner. This study therefore investigated their comparative efficacy over 12 weeks including illness characteristics and adverse effects. One hundred thirty-one patients (76 M, 55 F) with DSMI-V schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were treated with risperidone (n = 38), olanzapine (n = 38), or clozapine (n = 55). All patients showed a significant decrease of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-positive scores. Decreases in tardive dyskinesia and impulsivity scores were noted with clozapine and olanzapine, respectively. No differences between the medications were noted on depression, anxiety, EPS, or overt aggression scores. Olanzapine and clozapine appeared to be more effective in females. Males showed a decreased sexual performance irrespective of the medication and those treated with risperidone and clozapine showed greater proportional reduction of overt aggression. Clozapine-treated patients showed significant increased weight, increased glucose levels, and lowered sexual performance. Risperidone patients tended to exhibit reduced cholesterol levels. Higher creatine kinase (CK) levels were noted in risperidone-treated patients. While cautious given the nature of the study design, results suggest differences in the response to various atypical antipsychotic medications regarding efficacy and side-effect susceptibility.", 
    "73": "Negative symptoms are considered the most debilitating and refractory aspect of schizophrenia, being associated with poor social, occupational and global outcomes. Conventional antipsychotics have limited efficacy against these symptoms and poor tolerability profiles. Atypical antipsychotics are an alternative treatment, and this 12-week, randomised, flexibly dosed study compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of quetiapine and olanzapine in this regard. Of the 40 patients who entered the study (32 male; 8 female), 19 were randomised to quetiapine (mean dose 637 mg/day, mean treatment duration 80 days) and 21 to olanzapine (mean dose 16 mg/day, mean treatment duration 78 days). Quetiapine and olanzapine were similarly effective: in each treatment group significant improvements at Week 12 were observed for negative symptom scores on the SANS and the PANSS, and for subscale scores of affective flattening and alogia on the SANS. Both treatments were well tolerated in this patient population, with no worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms in either case. Anxiety and insomnia were the most common adverse events (> or =7% of patients in each group), but were not drug-related. Although this is a small study with limited power, the results support the effectiveness of quetiapine and olanzapine in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",

In a separate experiment, observable behavioral effects (e.g., ataxia and procumbent posture) were quantified after administration of alprazolam, zaleplon, and QH-ii-066. To further assess the roles of GABAA receptor subtypes, zolpidem-induced increases in pellet consumption were re-evaluated after pretreatment with nonselective antagonist flumazenil, the alpha1GABAA-preferring antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (BCCT), or QH-ii-066.",

However, attempts to create an animal model of antipsychotic-induced weight gain were not successful so far. Female rodents are sensitive to the effects of antipsychotics, but not males. This does not match the human clinical situation. Antipsychotics have different pharmacokinetic properties in rats and humans, and rats and humans have different spontaneous diets.", 
    "84": "In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the insensitivity of male rats to the weight-promoting effects of antipsychotics could be related to the mode of administration of antipsychotics and to the animals' diet.

Dose-response relationships for GABA were compared in the absence and presence of 1 microM diazepam (DZP) or methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). The dose-current relationships yielded EC(50)'s (concentration for half-maximal activation) of 41.0+/-3.0, 21.7+/-2.7, and 118.3+/-6.8 microM for GABA, GABA plus DZP, and GABA plus DMCM, respectively.DZP- and DMCM-mediated modulation were examined in GABA(A) receptors in which the beta-subunit carries the L259S mutation. This mutation has been shown to produce spontaneous opening and impart a leftward shift in the dose-response relationship. In this case, neither DZP nor DMCM produced a significant alteration in the GABA dose-response relationship with GABA EC(50)'s of 0.078+/-0.005, 0.12+/-0.03, and 0.14+/-0.004 microM for GABA, GABA plus 1 microM DZP, and GABA plus 1 microM DMCM.DZP- and DMCM-mediated modulations were examined in GABA(A) receptors in which the alpha-subunit carries the L263S mutation. This mutation also produced spontaneous opening and a leftward shift of the GABA dose-response relation, but to a lesser extent than that of betaL259S. In this case, the leftward and rightward shifts for DZP and DMCM were still present with EC(50)'s=0.24+/-0.03, 0.14+/-0.02, and 1.2+/-0.04 microM for GABA, GABA plus 1 microM DZP, and GABA plus 1 microM DMCM, respectively.Oocytes expressing ultrahigh levels of wild-type GABA(A) receptors exhibited currents in response to 1 muM DZP alone, whereas DMCM decreased the baseline current. The DZP-mediated activation currents were determined in wild-type receptors as well as receptors in which the GABA binding site was mutated (beta2Y205S). The EC(50)'s for DZP-mediated activation were 72.0+/-2.0 and 115+/-6.2 nM, respectively, similar to the EC(50) for DZP-mediated enhancement of the wild-type GABA-activated current (64.8+/-3.7 nM). Our results support a mechanism in which DZP increases the apparent affinity of the receptor, not by altering the affinity of the closed state, but rather by shifting the equilibrium towards the high-affinity open state.", 
    "88": "With increase in the use of newer psychotropics, there is a growing concern in relation to the teratogenicity. Unfortunately, it is not possible to carry out prospective studies in pregnant women and as a result physicians caring for such patients have to rely on case reports, case series, and retrospective studies. Available evidence shows that the safety of psychotropics in pregnancy is still unresolved and the decision to prescribe psychotropics in pregnancy should be taken in the light of severity of mental disease, and drugs should be prescribed only when the potential risk to the foetus from exposure is outweighed by the risk of untreated maternal disorder. In this review we discussed the current evidence of the teratogenic risks with psychotropic drugs commonly used to treat psychiatric disorders and also focused on decision making in such patients.",

    "93": "In this study, induction and inhibition of rhesus monkey CYP3A64 versus human CYP3A4 were characterized in vitro, and the corresponding pharmacokinetic consequences were evaluated in rhesus monkeys. In monkey hepatocytes, rifampin markedly induced CYP3A64 mRNA (EC50 = 0.5 microM; Emax = 6-fold) and midazolam (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylase activity (EC50 = 0.2 microM; Emax = 2-fold). Compound A (N-[2(R)-hydroxy-1(S)-indanyl-5-[2(S)-(1,1-dimethylethylaminocarbonyl)-4-[(furo[2,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-methyl]piperazin-1-yl]-4(S)-hydroxy-2(R)-phenylmethylpentanamide), a known potent and mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, strongly inhibited the formation of 1'-hydroxy MDZ by recombinant CYP3A64 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (KI = 0.25 microM; k(inact) = 0.4 min(-1)). Similar corresponding results also were obtained with human CYP3A4 in the presence of rifampin or compound A. In rhesus monkeys, MDZ exhibited a relatively high metabolic clearance (primarily via 1'-hydroxylation followed by glucuronidation) and a low hepatic availability (Fh = 16%). Consistent with the induction of hepatic metabolism of a high-clearance compound, pretreatment with rifampin (18 mg/kg p.o. for 5 days) did not significantly affect the i.v. kinetics of MDZ, but caused a pronounced reduction (approximately 10-fold) in the systemic exposure to MDZ and, consequently, its Fh following intrahepatic portal vein administration (i.pv.) of MDZ. A comparable extent of the pharmacokinetic interaction also was obtained after a 1.8 mg/kg rifampin dose. Also consistent with the in vitro CYP3A64 inhibition finding, compound A (6 mg/kg i.v.) markedly increased (10-fold) the i.pv. administered MDZ exposure. At the doses studied, plasma concentrations of rifampin or compound A reached or exceeded their respective in vitro EC50 or KI values. These findings suggest the potential applicability of the in vitro-in vivo relationship approach in rhesus monkeys for studying CYP3A-mediated interactions in humans.", 
    "94": "Atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, have been associated with clinically significant weight gain. Changes to the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis may partially mediate this weight increase. Two experiments were conducted to test the effects of mifepristone on both mitigating and preventing olanzapine-induced weight gain. In the first experiment, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats gained significantly more weight on average when administered olanzapine for 35 days compared to vehicle controls. Subsequently, the olanzapine-treated rats were randomized to three dose levels of mifepristone (20, 60, and 200 mg/kg) in conjunction with olanzapine. Weight measurements were taken for 21 additional days. Rats receiving olanzapine plus mifepristone rapidly lost a significant portion of the weight gained during the olanzapine only phase (p = 0.0001). Rats in the 200 mg/kg dose group had significantly less abdominal fat compared to controls (p < 0.001) at study end. In the second experiment, daily mifepristone (20, 60, 200 mg/kg) initiated concomitantly with olanzapine was compared with olanzapine alone to determine if mifepristone prevented olanzapine-induced weight gain. After 21 days of treatment, mifepristone treated rats gained significantly less weight and had significantly less abdominal fat than rats administered olanzapine alone (p = 0.0002). Results suggest that mifepristone, a potent glucocorticoid antagonist, may both reduce and prevent olanzapine-induced weight gain in rats.", 
    "95": "Non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist administration induces a syndrome indistinguishable from schizophrenia including positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Concordantly, augmentation of the NMDA receptor function by glycine-site agonists such as D-serine and D-cycloserine has been reported to improve negative symptoms and some cognitive deficits in schizophrenia patients when added to conventional antipsychotic treatment, although they appear less effective when combined with clozapine specifically. In contrast, administration of the AMPAkine CX-516 (which positively modulate the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor) as an adjuvant to clozapine, has been shown to exert some beneficial action on the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. In the rat, selective suppression of conditioned avoidance response (CAR) behaviour has been widely reported to be a test with high predictive validity for antipsychotic efficacy. We found that D-serine and CX-516, at doses ineffective by themselves, significantly potentiated the suppression of CAR induced by threshold doses of risperidone (0.16 mg/kg, s.c.), olanzapine (0.63 mg/kg, s.c.) and clozapine (1.3 mg/kg, s.c.) without causing additional motor disturbances. Thus, the adjunct enhancement of NMDA or AMPA receptor function observed clinically, appears reflected in the present rat CAR study. Consequently, our data lend further support to the potential use of the CAR test in the investigation of augmentation strategies involving the addition of non-dopaminergic target compounds to existing atypical antipsychotics.", 
    "96": "Arginine vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing factor are two neuroactive peptides that regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-axis and associated stress response. While the potential antidepressant and anxiolytic profiles of corticotropin-releasing factor 1 antagonists have been well studied, the concept of blockade of vasopressin system as another approach for the treatment of emotional processes has only been made available recently by the synthesis of the first non-peptide antagonist at the V1b receptor, SSR149415. In the present study SSR149415 has been compared with the corticotropin-releasing factor 1 antagonist SSR125543 and with anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs on the response of hippocampal cholinergic and cortical noradrenergic systems to the anxiogenic benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG 7142. Acute (0.3-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and long-term administration (10 mg/kg, i.p., 21 days) of SSR149415 and SSR125543 reduced the FG 7142-induced increase in extracellular concentrations of acetylcholine in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats measured by microdialysis. By contrast acute and long-term administration of SSR149415 failed to reduce the FG 7142-induced increase in the release of norepinephrine in the cortex of freely moving rats. The present results demonstrate that the two compounds have similar profiles in a model of activation by an anxiogenic drug of the hippocampal cholinergic system and they suggest that SSR149415 and SSR125543 may have anti-stress anxiolytic and antidepressant effects via a mechanism of action different from classical benzodiazepine ligands and noradrenergic antidepressants.", 
    "97": "We examined the anti-stress action of the essential oils of lavender, rose, and lemon using an elevated plus-maze task (EPM), a forced swimming task (FST), and an open field task (OFT) in mice. Lemon oil had the strongest anti-stress effect in all three behavioral tasks. We further investigated a regulatory mechanism of the lemon oil by pre-treatments with agonists or antagonists to benzodiazepine, 5-HT, DA, and adrenaline receptors by the EPM and the FST. The anti-stress effect of lemon oil was significantly blocked by pre-treatment with frumazenil, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, or apomorphine, a nonselective DA receptor agonist. In contrast, agonists or antagonists to the 5-HT receptor and the alpha-2 adrenaline receptor did not affect the anti-stress effect of lemon oil. Buspirone, DOI, and mianserine blocked the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil in the FST, but WAY100,635 did not. These findings suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil is closely related with the 5-HTnergic pathway, especially via 5-HT(1A) receptor. Moreover, the lemon oil significantly accelerated the metabolic turnover of DA in the hippocampus and of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that lemon oil possesses anxiolytic, antidepressant-like effects via the suppression of DA activity related to enhanced 5-HTnergic neurons.", 
    "98": "In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), progestins have actions involving dopamine type 1-like receptors (D(1)) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GBRs) for lordosis. Evidence suggests that D(1) and GBRs can have G-protein-mediated effects. We investigated if, in the VTA, inhibiting G-proteins prevents D(1)- and/or GBR-mediated increases in progestin-facilitated lordosis. Hamsters, with bilateral guide cannulae to the VTA, received systemic E(2) (10 microg) at hour 0 and progesterone (P, 250 microg) at hour 45. At hour 48, hamsters were pre-tested for lordosis and infused with the G-protein inhibitor, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S, 50 microM/side), or 10% DMSO saline vehicle. Thirty minutes after initial infusions, hamsters were re-tested and then immediately infused with the D(1) agonist, SKF38393 (100 ng/side), the GBR agonist, muscimol (100 ng/side), or saline vehicle. Hamsters were post-tested for lordosis 30 min later. For rats, E(2) (10 microg) priming at hour 0 was followed by lordosis pre-testing at hour 44. After pre-testing, rats received infusions of GDP-beta-S or vehicle, followed by infusions of SKF38393, muscimol, or vehicle and then infusions of the neurosteroid, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP, 100 or 200 ng/side), or beta-cyclodextrin vehicle. Rats were tested immediately after each infusion of SKF38393, muscimol or vehicle, as well as 10 and 60 min after 3alpha,5alpha-THP or vehicle infusions. Inhibiting G-proteins, in the VTA, reduced the ability of systemic P or intra-VTA SKF38393 or muscimol to facilitate lordosis of E(2)-primed hamsters. Blocking G-proteins, in the VTA, prevented SKF38393-, muscimol- and/or 3alpha,5alpha-THP-mediated increases in lordosis of E(2)-primed rats. Thus, progestins' actions in the VTA for lordosis that involve D(1) and/or GBRs may also include recruitment of G-proteins.", 
    "99": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa that induces anxiolytic-like effects similar to diazepam in animal models of innate aversive behavior. However, the effects of CBD contextual conditioned fear have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare the behavioral and cardiovascular effects of CBD and diazepam, a prototype anxiolytic, in animals submitted to a contextual conditioned fear paradigm. Male Wistar rats were submitted to a 10min conditioning session (six footshocks, 2.5 mA, 3s, delivered at pseudo-random intervals). The behavioral and cardiovascular responses to the context were measured 24h later in a 10 min test session. Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg), FG-7142 (8 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, or CBD (10 mg/kg) were administered i.p. before the test session. Conditioned rats submitted to the aversive context exhibited more freezing behavior and a larger increase in blood pressure and heart rate as compared to non-conditioned animals. These effects were attenuated by CBD and diazepam in the conditioned animals. These drugs did not have any effect in non-conditioned rats. FG-7142 treatment failed to change the behavioral and cardiovascular responses to the aversive context. In conclusion, the results suggest that CBD has anxiolytic-like properties similar to those of diazepam in a rat model of conditioned fear to context.",

Concurrent antiepileptic medication was lamotrigine at 13mg/kg/day. Clobazam plasma levels were within the normal range, while N-desmethylclobazam (DCLB) concentrations were between five and seven times above the upper limit of the normal range. The plasma elimination half-life for DCLB was prolonged, suggesting a genetic variability in DCLB metabolism leading to toxicity. Reduction in the dose of clobazam to 0.3mg/kg/day was associated with resolution of the non-epileptic neurological symptoms, reduction in DCLB plasma levels, and maintenance of seizure control.",

Benzodiazepines, barbiturates and propofol, the main actins of which are facilitation of GABAA receptor functions, also facilitate accumulation of endogenous adenosine in the extracellular space by inhibiting adenosine uptake via adenosine transporters. The accumulated adenosine depresses excitatory synaptic transmission by decreasing transmitter release, depressing postsynaptic sensitivity and inhibiting neuronal excitability through adenosine A1 receptors and the related adenosine neuromodulatory system. The adenosine-induced depressions of excitatory synaptic transmissions probably contribute to the mechanisms of the anesthetic, sedative, anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of these anesthetics and sedatives. An understanding of the synaptic mechanisms of these anesthetics and sedatives through the adenosine neuromodulatory system is needed for rational clinical use of the drugs.",

The peaks were detected at 254 nm. Mean recoveries for olanzapine and internal standard were 89.4+/-3.3% and 90.4+/-1.0%, respectively. Coefficient of variation value for intraday was 5.0% at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 ng/mL and for interday was 4.0% at concentrations of 5 and 25 ng/mL. Accuracy, expressed as percent error, ranged from -8.00% to 1.24%. Limit of detection and limit of quantification for olanzapine were 2 and 5 ng/mL, respectively. The method is suitable for pharmacokinetic studies and therapeutic drug monitoring.", 
    "115": "Misuse of prescription sedatives is a significant problem for addiction treatment services. The aim of this study was to examine the prescribing of diazepam in disadvantaged Irish communities, and to identify factors which may predict diazepam consumption in that population. We examined prescribing trends for those aged 16-69 years in 2002 in a region of the state-funded General Medical Services Scheme. Material deprivation was based on the 2002 Small Area Health Research Unit (SAHRU) deprivation index. The average defined daily dose (DDD) was calculated and logistic regression analysis was used to predict diazepam use by age, gender and deprivation index. Results showed that patients living in the most-deprived areas were more likely to receive diazepam than patients living in the least-deprived areas (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.15-1.27). Female patients living in the most-deprived areas were also more likely to receive diazepam than those living in the least-deprived areas (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.18-1.57). It is concluded that there is a pattern of higher diazepam prescribing in areas of greatest deprivation, where prescription sedatives play a complex role within troubled families.", 
    "116": "The Brugada syndrome is an arrhythmogenic disease with characteristic coved ST-segment elevation 2 mm or greater in the right precordial leads (type 1 Brugada electrocardiogram [ECG] pattern or \"Brugada sign\"] and is estimated to be responsible for at least 20% of sudden deaths in patients with structurally normal hearts [Circulation 2005;111(5):659-70]. The Brugada sign has been described in asymptomatic patients after exposure to various drugs. As published reports of the drug-induced Brugada sign have become increasingly prevalent, there is growing interest in the mechanisms responsible for this acquired ECG pattern and its clinical significance. We report a case of a patient who developed the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern after intentional overdose of a tricyclic antidepressant agent, review the literature concerning tricyclic antidepressant agent-induced Brugada sign, discuss potential mechanisms, and evaluate the clinical significance of this ECG abnormality.", 
    "117": "This review summarizes recent developments in the field of sleep regulation, particularly in the role of hormones, and of synthetic GABA(A) receptor agonists. Certain hormones play a specific role in sleep regulation. A reciprocal interaction of the neuropeptides growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a key role in sleep regulation. At least in males GHRH is a common stimulus of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and GH and inhibits the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) hormones, whereas CRH exerts opposite effects. Furthermore CRH may enhance rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). Changes in the GHRH:CRH ratio in favor of CRH appear to contribute to sleep EEG and endocrine changes during depression and normal ageing. In women, however, CRH-like effects of GHRH were found. Besides CRH somatostatin impairs sleep, whereas ghrelin, galanin and neuropeptide Y promote sleep. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide appears to be involved in the temporal organization of human sleep. Beside of peptides, steroids participate in sleep regulation. Cortisol appears to promote REMS. Various neuroactive steroids exert specific effects on sleep. The beneficial effect of estrogen replacement therapy in menopausal women suggests a role of estrogen in sleep regulation. The GABA(A) receptor or GABAergic neurons are involved in the action of many of these hormones. Recently synthetic GABA(A) agonists, particularly gaboxadol and the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine were shown to differ distinctly in their action from allosteric modulators of the GABA(A) receptor like benzodiazepines as they promote slow-wave sleep, decrease wakefulness and do not affect REMS.",

    "130": "We report the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed involuntary jerks of the abdominal musculature. They occurred spontaneously or triggered by a forced inspiration or attempts to rise from the supine position. Electromyography (EMG) recorded abnormal bursts of muscle activity in the abdominal, thoracic paraspinal, and intercostal muscles up to the 3rd intercostal space. The bursts were bilateral, arrythmic and synchronous in all muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed a syringomyelic cavity between the T3 and T10 levels. The topological correlation between the EMG muscle activities and the MRI findings was consistent with spinal myoclonus arising from the thoracic spinal cord. The synchronous bursts in muscles depending from few adjacent spinal segments suggested the diagnosis of segmental spinal myoclonus (SSM). There are few reports of SSM related to syringomyelia in the literature.", 
    "131": "Addicts have an exaggerated organic and psychological comorbidity and in cases of major operations or polytrauma they are classified as high-risk patients. Additional perioperative problems are a higher analgetics requirement, craving, physical and/or psychological withdrawal symptoms, hyperalgesia and tolerance. However, the clinical expression depends on the substance abused. For a better understanding of the necessary perioperative measures, it is helpful to classify the substances into central nervous system depressors (e.g. heroin, alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics), stimulants (e.g. cocaine, amphetamines, designer drugs) and other psychotropic substances (e.g. cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants). The perioperative therapy should not be a therapy for the addiction, as this is senseless. On the contrary, the characteristics of this chronic disease must be accepted. Anesthesia and analgesia must be generously stress protective and sufficiently analgesically effective. Equally important perioperative treatment principles are stabilization of physical dependence by substitution with methadone (for heroin addicts) or benzodiazepines/clonidine (for alcohol, sedatives and hypnotics addiction), avoidance of stress and craving, thorough intraoperative and postoperative stress relief by using regional techniques or systematically higher than normal dosages of anesthetics and opioids, strict avoidance of inadequate dosage of analgetics, postoperative optimization of regional or systemic analgesia by non-opioids and coanalgetics and consideration of the complex physical and psychological characteristics and comorbidities. Even in cases of abstinence (clean) an inadequate dosage must be avoided as this, and not an adequate pain therapy sometimes even with strong opioids, can potentially activate addiction. A protracted abstinence syndrome after withdrawal of opioids can lead to increased response to administered opioids (e.g. analgesia, side-effects).",

We discuss the case of a 31-year-old primigravida at 22 weeks of gestation, with a history of bipolar disorder, who underwent electroconvulsive therapy under general anesthesia. Following three treatments she developed status epilepticus, requiring large doses of benzodiazepines, thiopental, propofol and diphenylhydantoin to control the seizure activity. She remained intubated and ventilated for several days after treatment with a complicated course. As a consequence, the fetus died.

    "133": "To investigate excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the reasons for which have not yet been clarified, polysomnography (PSG) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) were performed in 46 patients with PD, and, in addition, PSG was performed in 30 healthy controls. Assessment included Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Hamilton Test (HT) for depression. Fifty percent of PD patients reported EDS (ESS, 10 +/- 4.5 vs. 6.9 +/- 3.7; P = 0.01). Compared with controls, PD patients as a group had lower sleep efficiency (65 +/- 22 vs. 77 +/- 14; P = 0.03), a longer Stage 2 (73 +/- 12 vs. 67 +/- 12; P = 0.03), and a shorter rapid eye movement stage (8 +/- 8 vs. 17 +/- 8; P < 0.001). Clinical data and sleep characteristics were similar in PD with/without EDS. Of interest, patients treated with clonazepam (CLNZ) had lower EDS than those without CLNZ (ESS, 7.9 +/- 4.7 vs. 11.3 +/- 4.0; P = 0.03). These patients suffered less periodic leg movement during sleep (2.1 +/- 2.7 vs. 12.4 +/- 28; P = 0.04), which might explain the finding. No correlation was found between ESS, MSLT, and all other clinical features analyzed. In PD patients, according to the data obtained, severity of EDS does not depend on any specific clinical factor and the etiology is probably multifactorial. Paradoxically, PD patients treated with CLNZ were less sleepy than patients not treated with CLNZ.", 
    "134": "There is no established treatment for the neurological features of the recently discovered fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Fifty-six patients with FXTAS completed a questionnaire to determine whether any medications had been effective for neurological symptoms. Of 11 subjects with definite FXTAS, 8 (70%) were on medications for their neurological symptoms, whereas most subjects with possible or probable FXTAS, 31 (70%) of 45 subjects, were not on medications. Although no therapy was uniformly effective for intention tremor, ataxia, Parkinsonism, memory loss, or anxiety, some subjects with intention tremor or Parkinsonism reported improvement with medications frequently used in other movement disorders. Overall, all 22 subjects on medications reported improvement in one or more symptoms. Lack of insight, recall bias, and cognitive impairment may have resulted in an underestimation of the beneficial effect of medical therapy. This study suggests that patients with FXTAS can derive improvement from medication treatment for some of their symptoms.", 
    "135": "This case report is about the combined use of modified electroconvulsive treatment and an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, in the treatment of a 20-year-old man with chronic and refractory catatonic stupor. This patient, with a preexisting diagnosis of autism, posturing, nonverbal communication, and contracture of lower extremities, displaying mutism, akinesia, and an extreme level of rigidity, waxy flexibility, and posturing, was diagnosed as with catatonic stupor. After hospitalization, the disease had progressed despite the treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine. Modified electroconvulsive treatment together with olanzapine caused a dramatic clinical improvement. Follow-up outpatient treatment with olanzapine improved his social functions.", 
    "136": "We have proved that a modified strategy (ie, lorazepam intramuscular injection [IMI] or diazepam intravenous drip [IVD] if lorazepam IMI fails) can rapidly relieve catatonic features in patients with schizophrenia. During a period of 3 years, we identified 7 major depressive patients with catatonic features in the emergency unit of a general hospital. The patients were treated with lorazepam IMI (dose, 2 mg/mL.per ampule) once or twice during the first 2 hours. If lorazepam IMI failed, diazepam IVD (dose, 10 mg/2 mL.per ampule) in 500 mL normal saline every 8 hours for 1 day would be administered. The total complete remission rate to lorazepam IMI within 2 hours was 6 (85.7%) per 7 patients, and the total complete remission rate to benzodiazepines (lorazepam IMI and diazepam IVD) within 1 day was 7 (100%) of all 7 patients. These results highly suggest that this modified strategy can also rapidly relieve catatonic features in major depression within 1 day and attain a high complete remission rate, even without electroconvulsive therapy.", 
    "137": "Acute psychotic episodes represent critical situations during the course of schizophrenia. Olanzapine (OLZ), a second-generation antipsychotic, is efficacious in acute settings at dosages of 5 to 20 mg/d, and it can be considered a first-line treatment for patients with an acute episode of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of OLZ at a starting dose of 5 mg versus 20 mg in acute schizophrenic patients and to compare titration versus nontitration.Fifty-one schizophrenic inpatients were randomly assigned to receive OLZ at 5 mg/d (26 patients, group 1) or 20 mg/d (25 patients, group 2) as a starting dosage during an exacerbation phase. In group 1, the OLZ dosage was increased to a mean dosage of 10.55 (+/- 4.00) mg/d. Group 2 received OLZ at a fixed dose of 20 mg throughout the hospitalization period. Olanzapine was significantly and clinically effective on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS positive symptoms, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression in both groups. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in the percent improvement in BPRS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS positive symptoms, PANSS negative symptoms, or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; but group 2 was significantly superior in the mean percent improvement in the BPRS items of anxiety (P < 0.001) and suspiciousness (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the higher doses evidence more efficacy on anxiety and suspiciousness, so it seems to be useful to begin therapy with a full dose of the drug to obtain the maximum effect without any significant side effects.", 
    "138": "Few randomized controlled trials of oral pharmacotherapy have been performed in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The prevalence of CRPS is uncertain. Severe and advanced cases of CRPS are easily recognized but difficult to treat and constitute a minority compared with those who meet minimum criteria for the diagnosis. Unsettled disability or liability claims limit pharmaceutical industry interest in the disorder. Many studies are small or anecdotal, or are reported on only via posters at meetings. Targeting the process of bone resorption with bisphosphonate-type compounds such as calcitonin, clodronate, and alendronate has shown efficacy in three published randomized controlled trials. Intravenous phentolamine has been studied both alone and in comparison to intravenous regional blockade or stellate ganglion block. Steroids continue to be administered by multiple routes without large-scale placebo-controlled trials. Topical medications have received little attention. There has been considerable interest in the use of thalidomide and TNF-alpha blockers for CRPS, but no published controlled trials as of yet. Numerous other oral drugs, including muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids, have been reported on anecdotally. Some therapies have been the subject of early controlled studies, without subsequent follow-up (eg, ketanserin) or without an analogous well-tolerated and equally effective oral treatment (eg, intravenous ketamine). Gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioids have been proven effective for chronic pain in disorders other than CRPS. Each has shown a broad enough spectrum of analgesic activity to be cautiously recommended for treatment of CRPS until adequate randomized controlled trials settle the issue. The relative benefit of oral medications compared with the widely used treatments of intensive physical therapy, nerve blocks, sympathectomy, intraspinally administered drugs, and neuromodulatory therapies (eg, spinal cord stimulation) remains uncertain. In summary, treatment of CRPS has received insufficient study and remains largely empirical.", 
    "139": "Three simple spectrophotometric methods have been described for the assay of olanzapine in its pure and pharmaceutical formulations. The direct method (A) is based on the drug oxidation with excess of N-bromosuccinimide in acidic medium and the two indirect methods (B and C) are based on the oxidation of the drug with excess of N-bromosuccinimide and cerium(IV)sulfate, followed by the reaction of the unconsumed oxidants with celestine blue. The calibration graphs were linear over the range 10 - 120 microg mL(-1) (method A), 0.5 - 6.0 microg mL(-1) (method B) and 0.6 - 3.0 microg mL(-1) (method C). After validation, the proposed methods were successfully applied to assay of olanzapine in its commercial tablets with mean percentage recoveries of 101.23 +/- 0.10, 96 +/- 0.10 and 94 +/- 0.04%. The mechanism of olanzapine oxidation with N-bromosuccinimide was also proposed.", 
    "140": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) inhibits food intake in adults. This paper describes research examining the ability of CCK to affect feeding in infant rats and the role of CCK in the developmentally emerging ability of the rat pup to inhibit ingestion in response to sensory characteristics of food. First, data will be described from studies that asked if the CCK system is functional in preweanling rats. Specifically, these studies examined whether exogenous and endogenous CCK can decrease intake of the infant rat during independent ingestion (of a milk diet, away from the dam). In addition, the ability of exogenous CCK to activate central feeding-control areas in the brain stem and hypothalamus in infant rats was examined by C-FOS staining. Next, experiments examining which specific intake-inhibitory sensory aspects of food are mediated by CCK will be described. The volume, hypertonicity, fat, carbohydrate and protein content of a preload were separately manipulated in different studies, followed closely by a 30-min test meal. The selective CCK(1) receptor antagonist devazepide was used to assess CCK mediation of the control of intake produced by particular sensory aspects of food, at the earliest age in which this ability to control intake appears. Finally, the pattern of independent ingestion in infant OLETF rats lacking CCK(1) receptors was examined. The results suggest that the CCK intake-inhibitory mechanism is potentially available to the young, suckling pup even before it starts to feed on its own. However, it appears to mediate only a portion of the controls of intake during nursing and early stages of weaning. Some aspects of the CCK system (e.g., forebrain-hindbrain connections) and CCK's role in mediating the effects of other stimulus aspects of food apparently undergo a post-weaning maturational process.", 
    "141": "Episodes of psychogenic nonepileptic status epilepticus (PNESE) characterized by pronounced generalized motor features were compared with those of refractory generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Patients with PNESE were younger, had port systems implanted more frequently, received higher doses of benzodiazepines until seizure termination or respiratory failure, and had lower serum creatine kinase levels.", 
    "142": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in the distribution for the P300 generator, as demonstrated by Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) images, in patients with schizophrenia during treatment with olanzapine. Data were obtained from five right-handed patients treated with olanzapine for 6 months. Five right-handed normal volunteers also participated in the study. LORETA images of P300 in response to the odd-ball auditory discrimination task revealed a left dominant lateralized high current source density in the temporal lobes in all control subjects. Although this pattern of brain activation was not evident in patients at baseline, 6-month treatment with olanzapine recovered the left dominant pattern of the electrical density in the temporal regions, such as the Heschl gyrus, and improved performance on a test of verbal learning and memory. Scores of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale also improved during treatment. These results provide the first suggestion that enhancement of verbal memory and the functional status by treatment with some antipsychotic drugs may be associated with modulations of the anatomical configuration of electrical brain activity in patients with schizophrenia.",

The median dose of medication for risperidone was 1.5 mg/day, for olanzapine 10 mg/day, and for quetiapine 200 mg/day. The mean prolactin level among all patients on risperidone was significantly greater than controls, as well as for those on quetiapine or olanzapine.", 
    "146": "The risk of hyperprolactinemia with long-term use of risperidone appears to be significantly greater than for olanzapine or quetiapine. Overt side effects were infrequent in the overall sample, but serum prolactin assessment is recommended for youths taking risperidone chronically. Because of variability found in sequential prolactin samples, repeat samples may be warranted.",

    "149": "Drowsiness and decreased motor activity were common, especially in the first 2 weeks. Orthostatic hypotension, increased salivation, constipation, and nasal congestion were seen in more than 30% to 60% of patients treated with clozapine and were less common in adolescents treated with olanzapine and risperidone. Rigidity, tremor, and dystonia were seen in 5% to 15% of patients treated with risperidone and olanzapine. The average weight gain after 6 weeks of treatment with the atypical neuroleptics was significantly higher for the olanzapine group (4.6 +/- 1.9 kg) than for the risperidone (2.8 +/- 1.3 kg) and clozapine (2.5 +/- 2.9 kg) groups.",

    "151": "The acute and chronic effects of ramelteon, an MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, were evaluated in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to assess discriminative stimulus effects in comparison with traditional benzodiazepine receptor agonists and to assess physical dependence potential. Discriminative effects of ramelteon were compared with midazolam in untreated monkeys and in diazepam-dependent monkeys that discriminated flumazenil. Dependence potential of ramelteon after daily 1-year administration (and intermittent discontinuation) was evaluated with standard operant procedures. Ramelteon did not produce benzodiazepine-like discriminative stimulus effects at doses up to 10 mg/kg. Long-term treatment or its discontinuation had no significant effect on spontaneous behavior, operant behavior, body weight, motor activity, or posture. These findings suggest that ramelteon is not likely to have benzodiazepine-like abuse or dependence liability.",

Sixty-seven (67) patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for heroin dependence and showed aggressive personality traits, not affected by comorbid schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, accepted to participate in a 12-week prospective, observational trial. Patients were included into two subgroups in relationship with treatment, for the evaluation of the endpoints at week 12: group 1: substitution treatment in combination with OLA (32 patients); group 2: substitution treatment in combination with fluoxetine/paroxetine and clonazepam (35 patients). Efficacy measures were Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI), Symptoms Check List-90 (SCL 90) anger--hostility scores, incidence rates of aggressive incidents and attacks. The rates of patients who remained in treatment at week 12 in group 1, treated with OLA, and group 2, treated with SSRI and BDZ, were not significantly different (17 = 53.1% vs 16 = 45.7%). BDHI total, direct aggressiveness, verbal aggressiveness scores, SCL 90 aggressiveness scores and aggressive incidents rates showed a significantly more consistent decrease from baseline in group 1 than in group 2 subjects, in the patients who completed the treatment (p < 0.001; p < 0.01; p < 0.05; p < 0.01; p < 0.001). Among the completers, 69.3% achieved early full substance abuse remission, while 30.7% achieved partial substance abuse remission, with no significant difference between 1 and 2 treatment subgroups. Although obtained by an observational--open clinical study, with multiple limitations, our findings suggest that OLA may be useful as an adjunctive agent in reducing aggressive/hostile behaviour in heroin addicted individuals during maintenance substitution treatment. Otherwise, atypical anti-psychotic OLA seems to be unable to improve the outcome in terms of addictive behavior and relapse risk in the addicted patients not affected by overt psychotic disorders.", 
    "153": "This retrospective review of 286 acute pediatric burn survivors treated in 2001 evaluated the effectiveness of a pharmacotherapeutic protocol for pain, anxiety, and itching. Background pain, procedural pain, exercise pain, anxiety, incidence of acute stress disorder (ASD), and itch were measured with standardized instruments. When this review was compared to similar reviews done in 1993-1994 and 1998, a steady trend toward using more potent pain medications in this patient population is evident. While the use of acetaminophen alone decreased from 50.6% of patients in 1993-1994 and 26.3% in 1998 to 7.3% in 2001, the use of opiates increased from 44.8% in 1993-1994 and 66.9% in 1998 to 81.3% of patients in 2001. Likewise, the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety has increased from 59.8% in 1998 to 77.5% of patients in 2001. During that same period the incidence of ASD decreased from 12.1% in 1993-1994 to 8.7% of patients in 2001. For effective pain and anxiety management, the average administered dose of lorazepam and morphine also increased, providing impetus to revise the pharmacotherapeutic pain protocol. Having a standard pain protocol furnishes a framework for periodic review and facilitates updating of pain and anxiety treatment practices.",

CP 94253 (10-40 mg/kg) afforded no protection against maximal electroshock-evoked convulsions, but produced anticonvulsant action in the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures (ED50 = 29 mg/kg). The anticonvulsant effect of CP 94253 was abolished by the selective 5-HT1B receptor antagonist N-[3-(2-dimethylamino)ethoxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-carboxamide (SB 216641; 20 mg/kg) but it was maintained following the p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA; 3 x 300 mg/kg)-induced 5-HT depletion. Interestingly, CP 94253 potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam in the pentylenetetrazol test; on the other hand, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (10 mg/kg), did not modify the anticonvulsant effect of CP 94253. RU 24969 (5 mg/kg) evoked no effect in the maximal electroshock model, but it produced anticonvulsant activity in the pentylenetetrazol assay, the latter effect being attenuated by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-(2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY 100635; 0.3 mg/kg) and SB 216641 (10-20 mg/kg). The obtained results suggest that CP 94253 exerts anticonvulsant activity on pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice, as a consequence of stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors (probably located postsynaptically and/or as heteroreceptors); the antiseizure activity of RU 24969 seems to depend on the stimulation of both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.", 
    "155": "Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam in healthy volunteers.", 
    "156": "Nineteen healthy male volunteers were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5. The groups comprised subjects with CYP3A5*1/*1 (n=5), CYP3A5*1/*3 (n=7), or CYP3A5*3/*3 (n=7). After a single oral 1-mg dose of alprazolam, plasma concentrations of alprazolam were measured up to 72 hours, together with assessment of psychomotor function by use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, according to CYP3A5 genotype.", 
    "157": "The area under the plasma concentration-time curve for alprazolam was significantly greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (830.5+/-160.4 ng . h/mL [mean+/-SD]) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (599.9+/-141.0 ng . h/mL) (P=.030). The oral clearance of alprazolam was also significantly different between the CYP3A5*1/*1 group (3.5+/-0.8 L/h) and CYP3A5*3/*3 group (2.5+/-0.5 L/h) (P=.036). Although a trend was noted for the area under the Digit Symbol Substitution Test score change-time curve (area under the effect curve) to be greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (177.2+/-84.6) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (107.5+/-44), the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.148).", 
    "158": "The CYP3A5*3 genotype affects the disposition of alprazolam and thus influences the plasma levels of alprazolam.", 
    "159": "Lactating women undergoing operations requiring general anesthesia are advised to pump and discard their milk for 24 hours after the procedure. Data on anesthetic drug transfer into breast milk are limited. This study determined the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl transfer into milk to provide caregivers with data regarding the safety of breast milk after administration of these drugs.", 
    "160": "Five lactating women participated in this study after providing institutionally approved written informed consent. Patients underwent premedication with midazolam before induction of anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl. Anesthesia was maintained with a potent volatile anesthetic. Milk and blood were collected before drug administration. Milk was collected 5, 7, 9, 11, and 24 hours after drug administration. Venous blood was collected at intervals up to 7 hours. Plasma and milk midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl concentrations were measured by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometric or fluorescence detection. The pharmacokinetics of drug transfer into milk was modeled with plasma pharmacokinetics.", 
    "161": "Plasma midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl pharmacokinetics were consistent with reports of others. In 24 hours of milk collection, averages of 0.005% (range, 0.002%-0.013%) of the maternal midazolam dose, 0.027% (0.004%-0.082%) of the propofol dose, and 0.033% (0.006%-0.073%) of the fentanyl dose were collected in milk, representing averages of 0.009%, 0.025%, and 0.039% of the respective elimination clearances.", 
    "162": "The amount of midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl excreted into milk within 24 hours of induction of anesthesia provides insufficient justification for interrupting breast-feeding.", 
    "163": "Pregabalin, a compound with a novel mechanism of action (MOA), has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive treatment for epilepsy and in several neuropathic pain models. Multiple generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) clinical trials have shown that pregabalin has efficacy similar to the benzodiazepines and venlafaxine. Onset of anxiolytic effect was observed as early as Week 1 of treatment, and efficacy was seen in treating both psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Pregabalin binds potently and selectively to the alpha-2-delta subunit of \"hyper-excited\" voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). The binding of pregabalin to VGCCs changes their conformation, reducing calcium influx at nerve terminals. Pregabalin only modulates the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in \"hyper-excited\" neurons, restoring them to normal physiological state. This newly defined MOA is believed to confer on pregabalin its anxiolytic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant properties. Thus, pregabalin may offer physicians an effective and well-tolerated therapy for GAD, which differs from existing treatments.", 
    "164": "Among the known non-benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, Zolpidem (1a), Indiplon (2a) and Zaleplon (2b) have shown high affinity and selectivity for the alpha(1) subunit of the GABA-A receptor. Our group has performed pharmacophoric and ADMET-prediction studies to evaluate a virtual library of new molecules based on privileged structures. Among these, we have synthesized a library of N-substituted indoles and a library of N-substituted benzimidazoles. Afterwards, in vitro screening and in vivo spontaneous motor activity in mice has revealed molecules with good in vitro affinities for the alpha(1) receptor and potent in vivo induction of sedation.", 
    "165": "Clinical and experimental studies on focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) were carried out.", 
    "166": "For the experimental study, an experimental FCD model of rats was developed. Twenty Wistar rats at 0-2 days after birth were used for the study. Kainic acid (KA) solution was injected stereotaxically into medial and lateral sites of the sensori-motor cortex. Bipolar electrodes were inserted in five rats. Their behavior and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded using a digital-video-EEG monitoring system. After observation periods of 1, 2, and 6 months, rats were perfused for pathological study. FCD was observed adjacent to the site of KA injection in all rats more than 1 month after the injection.", 
    "167": "EEG recording demonstrated focal spike discharges in and around the site of injection. However, clinical seizure was not observed. Pathological studies showed decrease in GABA-A receptors and increase in GABA-B receptors not only in the lesion but also in perilesional areas. Fifteen surgical cases of FCD with intractable epilepsy were subjected to the clinical study. Neuro-imaging studies including high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography were performed. Conventional EEG studies demonstrated focal EEG abnormalities with epileptic phenomena. At surgery, intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) was performed to localize epileptic foci under neuroleptoanalgesia. Thirteen patients showed epileptiform discharges on preresection ECoG. All foci in non-eloquent areas were resected. Pathological studies including immunohistochemical staining were performed, and the characteristics of the FCD in relation to EEG findings were analyzed. Patients in whom total lesionectomy with complete focus resection was performed had favorable postoperative courses. Nine patients (64.3%) have been seizure-free with reduced medication, and significant improvement was achieved in two patients (14.3%). Electrophysiological examination revealed epileptogenecity not only in the lesions but also in perilesional areas. The immunohistochemical studies showed a decrease in GABA-A receptors and an increase in GABA-B receptors in both the lesions and perilesional areas, but N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptors were almost negative in both areas. Glutamate R1 was decreased in both areas, but glutamate R2 was increased in both areas. These findings support the results of a electrophysiological study.", 
    "168": "In conclusion, not only the epileptic property of experimental focal cortical dysplasia but also perilesional epileptogenesis was demonstrated. These findings supported the results of surgery for patients with focal cortical dysplasia. In cases of FCD, total removal of the lesion and resection of the perilesional epileptic focus are needed for a good outcome."
