Reduction in the EPS cell count was most marked with minocycline, trimethoprim was less effective and poor results were obtained with co-trimoxazole and diazepam. In the absence of established treatment for chronic non-bacterial prostatitis it is suggested that antimicrobial therapy is worth consideration.", 
    "1": "Diazepam has been reported to produce hypotension when administered with anesthetic doses of fentanyl. Twenty patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: group 1, no diazepam; groups 2, 3, and 4, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg X kg -1 of diazepam, respectively. All patients then received 50 micrograms X kg -1 fentanyl at 400 micrograms X min -1 and 0.4 mg X kg -1 metocurine at 2 mg X min -1. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded and blood was sampled for measurement of plasma catecholamine and histamine concentrations. Heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume index, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial and wedge pressures, and pulmonary vascular resistance did not change significantly in any group. Patients in groups 2-4 had significant decreases in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance during fentanyl infusion. These hemodynamic changes were accompanied by decreases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. These hemodynamic and hormonal changes did not occur in patients given fentanyl only. Plasma histamine levels did not change significantly in any group. Caution should be used when diazepam in doses as small as 0.125 mg X kg -1 are combined with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia.", 
    "2": "The effects of the acute or chronic administration of clobazam (20 mg/kg per os) on the plasma levels of the main anterior pituitary hormones (prolactin, FSH and LH) were studied in the male rat. This 1,5 benzodiazepine did not induce any modification of the hormones levels either after acute or chronic administration. These negative data are discussed as compared to the effects of other benzodiazepines or GABA and GABAmimetic drugs on the pituitary hormones levels according to particular experimental conditions.", 
    "3": "Knowledge about drug interactions with plastic materials used in medical and surgical practice is at an elementary stage. Information that has appeared so far on the sorption of drugs to intravenous fluid containers, delivery sets, syringes, or other plastic apparatus has highlighted that polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the major offender in this respect. Fortunately, in only a few cases is this sorption phenomenon and loss of drug from fluid likely to present a clinical hazard; in most instances, methods are available to prevent or overcome the problem, providing it is recognized. Current information suggests that the following drugs may exhibit clinically significant sorption to plastic materials: insulin, glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin), diazepam, chlormethiazole, vitamin A acetate, isosorbide dinitrate, and a miscellaneous group of drugs including some phenothiazines, warfarin sodium, hydralazine hydrochloride, and thiopentone sodium. In addition, chloroquine binds strongly to glass and to cellulose acetate, but seemingly not to plastics. Brief details of these interactions and their management are given, together with some preliminary information and warnings on drug interactions (e.g., epinephrine, rifampicin) with hydrophilic contact lenses. The latter interactions may cause irreversible coloration of the lenses.", 
    "4": "Progressive myoclonus epilepsy without Lafora's bodies (PME) is a rare inherited disease found predominantly in Finland, where the incidence is one case per 20,000 to 30,000 children. This fatal disease is characterized by normal early development, progressive stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, ataxia, dysarthria, occasional grand mal seizures, and loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the CSF averaged 89 +/- 10 pmole/mL (mean +/- SE) in eight patients with PME, compared with 135 +/- 18 pmole/mL in ten control patients. The concentrations of adenosine (16 pmole/mL v 17 pmole/mL), inosine (560 pmole/mL v 570 pmole/mL) and hypoxanthine (6.2 nmole/mL v 6.1 nmole/mL) were the same in patients with PME and in controls.", 
    "5": "A double-blind randomized controlled trial of diazepam against placebo in the management of minor conditions seen in general practice demonstrated that administration of either diazepam or placebo was associated with a substantial reduction in symptomatology three weeks later.

    "6": "Disturbed sleep is a common problem, particularly among elderly people, and is usually treated with hypnotics. The side effects of longterm administration of hypnotic drugs are well known, but despite this there remains a substantial population of chronic users. These people can be helped to reduce their dependence on hypnotics through psychological techniques. A group of longterm users treated in this manner were shown to reduce their intake of hypnotics significantly more than a group of users who did not receive any psychological treatment. Furthermore, the treated patients did not experience any deterioration in their sleep patterns, and their subjective refreshment from sleep improved significantly.For the patient with sleep problems, psychological techniques are preferable to the longterm use of hypnotics both as a weaning-off agent and as an alternative to drugs.", 
    "7": "Sixty female patients were given, in random order, under double-blind conditions, either midazolam or fat-emulsion diazepam, intramuscularly, as premedication, 1 h before general anaesthesia. The dose of midazolam used was 0.13 mg/kg and that of diazepam 0.17 mg/kg. The degree of sedation, mood of the patient, and time at which onset of effect was perceptible were assessed before induction of anaesthesia, together with skin temperature and concentrations of midazolam or diazepam in plasma. Patients were interviewed postoperatively to discover their subjective evaluation of the premedication and to assess its amnesic effects. Midazolam was significantly superior (P less than 0.05) to diazepam as regards sedation. There were no differences in effects on mood of the patients between the two groups. Sixteen patients in the diazepam group and four in the midazolam group had no perception of onset of effect. The difference is significant (P less than 0.01). The skin temperature was, on average, 2 degrees C higher in the midazolam group than in the diazepam group (P less than 0.005). The mean plasma concentration was 67.8 +/- 24.5 micrograms/l in the midazolam group and 44.8 +/- 25.7 micrograms/l in the diazepam group. In only two cases was the concentration of diazepam above 100 micrograms/l (arbitrarily defined as the minimum sedative concentration). Subjective evaluation of efficacy significantly (P less than 0.002) favoured midazolam. Local pain was evident in two patients in the diazepam group, and three patients experienced nausea immediately after administration of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "9": "Two hundred and forty four patients were randomised to receive either diazepam or emulsified diazepam (diazemuls) intravenously prior to routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, medical condition, vein size, and amount of drug administered. A quantitative assessment of symptoms at the injection site during the ensuing week was made by analysing questionnaires on pain and tenderness, which the patients graded each day, on a scale 0-3. Twenty-one out of 82 patients who received diazepam (25.6%) and 22 out of 84 who received diazemuls (26.2%) had local symptoms. Although the mean symptom scores over 7 days for the two groups were not different (5.95 +/- 5.19 and 7.27 +/- 6.30 respectively), more patients who received diazepam reported induration (P = 0.033). In 112 patients, signs of thrombosis in the injected veins were looked for 3-7 weeks later without knowledge of the preparation given. Thrombosis was present in 13 (25%) patients who had received diazepam and two (3.6%) who had received diazemuls (P less than 0.002). Only eight (53%) patients with thrombosed veins had symptoms. Thrombosis after intravenous injection of diazepam or diazemuls may be symptomless, and is significantly less likely following diazemuls.", 
    "10": "Prostaglandins A1, A2 and B2 (PG A1, A2 and B2) dose-dependently inhibited specific [3H]diazepam binding to rat brain membranes but did not affect specific [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to kidney membranes. The inhibition of [3H]diazepam binding to brain membranes by benzodiazepine agonists (diazepam and flurazepam) was potentiated by 30 microM GABA, whereas those of prostaglandins were not modified by the same concentration of GABA. These results suggest that PG A1, A2 and B2 specifically interact with central type-benzodiazepine receptors in a manner different from interactions seen with benzodiazepine agonists.", 
    "11": "Earlier behavioral results led to the suggestion that GABA exerts a tonic inhibitory influence in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) matter of the rat integrating defensive behavior. In the present experiments, the role of GABAergic mechanisms in the modulation of the autonomic component of the defense reaction was studied. Thus, the effects of intravenous (IV) injections of chlordiazepoxide as well as of intracerebral (IC) injections of midazolam in the dorsal midbrain, on the blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and respiratory increases induced by electrical stimulation of the DPAG were measured in rats anesthetized with urethane. Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, IV) as well as midazolam (40 and 160 nmol, IC) attenuated the centrally-induced hypertension, without affecting basal BP. The tachycardia induced by aversive brain stimulation was similarly decreased by the benzodiazepines. In addition, the HR baseline was significantly raised by chlordiazepoxide and by the highest dose of midazolam. The tachypnea induced by brain electrical stimulation was also reduced by both benzodiazepines. Basal respiratory rate was slightly, but significantly decreased by chlordiazepoxide as well as by the two doses of midazolam used and to a lesser extent by the vehicle alone. Chlordiazepoxide attenuated the increase in respiratory depth caused by brain stimulation, while basal respiratory amplitude was not affected. The effects of midazolam on this parameter were unclear. Microinjection of bicuculline (5 and 10 nmol) or picrotoxin (0.3 and 1 nmol) into the DPAG increased the BP, HR and respiration, like the electrical stimulation. The latency and duration of bucuculline effects were shorter than those of picrotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "The effects of several anaesthetic, convulsant and anticonvulsant drugs were studied upon high affinity [3H]GABA and [3H]diazepam binding to rat brain synaptosomal membranes in chloride-containing incubation buffers at 25 degrees C, conditions under which pentobarbitone extensively enhanced binding of both ligands to GABA-benzodiazepine-receptor-ionophore complexes. Of the compounds studied, only (+)-etomidate enhanced both GABA and diazepam binding; the sedative-hypnotic glutethimide weakly enhanced GABA binding while inhibiting diazepam binding. Several drugs, including beta-butyl-beta-methyl-glutarimide, phenobarbitone, pentylenetetrazole, and ketamine reversed the enhancement of GABA binding by pentobarbitone (500 microM) while not altering basal GABA or diazepam binding. Enhancement of high affinity GABA binding does not appear to be a general property of sedative or anticonvulsant drugs.", 
    "13": "The effects of a variety of factors known to influence the enhancement of GABA binding by diazepam, were studied upon pentobarbitone stimulation of GABA binding to washed synaptosomal membranes prepared from whole rat brains. The differential kinetics of, and effects of temperature, chloride ions, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (Ro15-1788) and picrotoxinin upon pentobarbitone and diazepam enhancement of GABA binding, suggest that these drugs exert their actions upon GABA binding at different loci. The degree of enhancement of diazepam binding and of high affinity GABA binding in chloride-containing media at 25 degrees C by members of a series of twelve side chain methyl substituted and/or unsaturated derivatives of 5-butyl-5-ethyl-barbituric acid (pentobarbitone analogs) correlated significantly. For the sedative members of the series, enhancement of high affinity GABA binding correlated with their anaesthetic but not their anticonvulsant activities. It appears likely that the anaesthetic and anticonvulsant activities of barbiturates arise from different molecular actions.", 
    "14": "Nickel (Ni+2) ions enhance the binding of 3H-diazepam, but decrease the binding of 3H-propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate to benzodiazepine receptors in mouse brain. Our experiments were performed to determine the locus for this action. In both control and Ca+2-depleted membranes, Ca+2 blocked the stimulatory effect of Ni+2 on 3H-diazepam binding in a concentration-dependent manner. In Ca+2-depleted membranes, physiological Ca+2 concentrations blocked this effect of Ni+2. In control membranes, Ca+2 did not reverse Ni+2 inhibition of 3H-propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding, but was effective at physiological concentrations in reversing Ni+2 inhibition in Ca+2-depleted membranes. The effects of Cd+2 ions on 3H-diazepam binding were similar to Ni+2 and were also reversed by Ca+2. The effects of Ni+2 were blocked by La+3 ions but not by Mg+2 ions, and were not due to interactions with the GABA receptor or Cl- ionophore. These data suggest that a Ca+2 binding site is associated with the brain benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "15": "Pregnant mice were treated with 1 and 5 mg/kg/day diazepam, respectively, during five days of the second and of the last third of gestation. The activity of Na, K-ATPase was determined in the brains of their offspring. Diazepam, 5 mg/kg/day, caused changes in the developmental patterns of the enzyme activity which did not become evident before 16 days of age. As expected from the low doses of diazepam applied the effect on enzyme activity was moderate. It may, however, provide a biochemical correlate of altered behaviour.", 
    "16": "The novel benzodiazepine tifluadom was compared with a selection of proposed mu- and kappa-opiate agonists using a combined heat/pressure nociceptive paradigm. Calculation of the relative potency ratios to the nociceptive stimuli revealed a distinction between mu- and kappa-agonists. The potency ratio yielded by tifluadom coincided with that displayed by the kappa-agonists and this finding is discussed in relation to morphine withdrawal and radioligand binding studies.", 
    "17": "The \"Trembler\" mouse, a neurologic mutant arising from a single dominant gene, is characterized by an action tremor thought to be caused by deficits in peripheral myelination. We found a significant elevation (twofold) over littermate control animals in the density of forebrain benzodiazepine receptors. This suggests that the deficit in peripheral myelination may not be the sole cause of the neurologic disorder.", 
    "18": "Behavioral, electroencephalographic, and evoked potential studies, as well as experiments utilizing the direct intracerebral injection of benzodiazepines (BZs), have implicated the amygdala, particularly its basolateral nuclear division, as an important locus of the therapeutic actions of these drugs. BZ receptor localization within the amygdala could further define which amygdaloid nuclei are important for BZ action and suggest neuroanatomical pathways especially sensitive to these drugs. Using a quantitative light microscopic autoradiographic technique, this study has localized type 1 and type 2 BZ receptors within the amygdaloid nuclear complex of the rat. BZ receptors were labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam, and type 1 BZ receptor binding was preferentially displaced by CL218,872 in 8-micron coronal sections of rat brain. Autoradiograms were generated by the apposition of emulsion-coated coverslips and quantified by standardized procedures. Ten amygdaloid nuclei were examined at nine levels over the rostrocaudal extent of the amygdala. Total BZ receptor density was highest in the basolateral nuclear complex, and the majority of these receptors were of the type 2 subclass. Type 1 receptors were concentrated in the anterior aspects of the amygdala, particularly the anterior cortical nucleus. These results are consistent with an important role for the basolateral amygdala in anxiogenesis and seizure induction. Furthermore, a larger circuit which includes the amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamus, mammillary body, anterior thalamus, and frontal cortex could be involved in the anxiolytic actions of the BZ drugs.", 
    "19": "The presence of a [3H]muscimol binding site on the purified benzodiazepine receptor was demonstrated. The purified protein was apparently homogeneous as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (stained with silver), with a molecular weight of 60,000 +/- 3000. The benzodiazepine binding sites were characterized as being of the central type and the [3H]flunitrazepam binding was enhanced by GABA. This activation was antagonized by bicuculline. [3H]Muscimol specifically binds to the benzodiazepine receptor. The Scatchard plot indicates a Kd of 23 nM and the ratio [3H]flunitrazepam/[3H]muscimol is approximately unity.", 
    "20": "The role of adenosine receptors in behavioral effects of alkylxanthines was evaluated in mice. The relative potencies of alkylxanthines in reversing locomotor activity depression elicited by L-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA) were similar to relative potencies in competing for adenosine receptors labeled by [3H]cyclohexyladenosine. Whereas L-PIA at i.p. doses of 0.10 mumol/kg and higher depressed locomotor activity, lower doses (0.01 and 0.05 mumol/kg) augmented locomotor activity. At the doses evaluated, caffeine did not further augment the L-PIA (0.05 mumol/kg)-enhanced locomotor activity. Low doses of diazepam, like L-PIA, augmented locomotor activity. Combining locomotor depressant doses of diazepam and caffeine produced a paradoxical stimulation of activity, as observed also for L-PIA and caffeine. Low doses of diazepam but not L-PIA increased crossings between the light and dark sites in a shuttle box, indicating a difference in the behavioral profile of these two agents. At behaviorally effective doses, L-PIA did not alter blood pressure or heart rate, but elicited some premature ventricular contractions which, however, occurred to a similar extent at locomotor depressant and stimulant doses of L-PIA. Brain levels of L-PIA at the lowest behaviorally active doses were adequate to occupy more than 50% of adenosine receptors. Thus, the behavioral effects of L-PIA appeared to be mediated in the brain and were not secondary to the cardiovascular effects.", 
    "21": "We have previously shown that administration of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to rats causes an increase in levels of the norepinephrine (NE) metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) by a clonidine-reversible mechanism (J. Neurochem. 40: 246-251, 1983). Further investigations have revealed that IBMX administration (100 mumol/kg i.p.) stimulates noradrenergic tyrosine hydroxylation in vivo (measured after decarboxylase inhibition), an effect also reversed by the alpha-2 agonist clonidine. Consistent with previous electrophysiological data, IBMX also accelerates the disappearance of NE after inhibition of tyrosine-3-monooxygenase. When axons of the NE-dorsal bundle are mechanically severed, the effect of IBMX on MHPG is not attenuated, in contrast to the effects of the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine which are blocked by axotomy. Administration of the adenosine agonist, 2-chloroadenosine (8 or 17 mumol/kg i.p.) or diazepam (35 mumol/kg) did not prevent the increase in MHPG caused by IBMX. The data, discussed in terms of enhanced noradrenergic activity, adenosine antagonism and phosphodiesterase inhibition, show that administration of methylxanthines (compounds known to produce anxiety and opiate withdrawal-like behaviors) results in increased biochemical activity of noradrenergic neurons in the rat.", 
    "22": "The kinetic profile of diazepam (DZP) was studied in plasma, erythrocytes, and eleven discrete brain areas of the rat, after intramuscular subchronic administration (15 days-5 mg/kg). DZP was rapidly distributed in brain areas. Its concentrations and its kinetic parameters were not uniform in the different brain areas we studied. The results showed the highest content of DZP in the hypothalamus, followed by the nucleus caudatus and the colliculi. Our data presented the erythrocyte as a \"deep compartment\". Comparatively to the results obtained after single administration, this study showed an increase of the apparent elimination half-life. Indeed, one observes a 2 fold increase for the plasma, and a 3.5 fold increase for the cerebral compartment. In the three brain areas studied (nucleus caudatus, hippocampus, and cerebellum) we observed a linear relationship with plasmatic or erythrocytic levels (0.978 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 0.992). It seems important to be considered in clinical pharmacology.", 
    "23": "Anxiety is a common problem and often its treatment is inappropriate. Many classes of drugs have been used and benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment. Although drugs in this group are almost equivalent in their anxiolytic and hypnotic effects there are differences between their pharmacological characteristics and dosage schedules.", 
    "24": "Effects of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and oxazepam on the antitumor activity and acute toxicity of cyclophosphamide and the level of its active metabolites in the plasma were investigated in mice. Cyclophosphamide was administered 24 h after the final injection of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam or oxazepam (100 mg/kg/d for 3 d, i.p.). Pretreatment with these drugs increased the acute toxicity of cyclophosphamide (300 or 450 mg/kg, i.p.), whereas drugs had no effect on the antitumor activity of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg, i.p.) against Ehrlich solid carcinoma. A high level of active metabolites of cyclophosphamide in the plasma after the administration of cyclophosphamide (300 or 450 mg/kg, i.p.) was observed in chlordiazepoxide-, diazepam- or oxazepam-treated mice. On the other hand, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam or oxazepam enhanced significantly the activity of cyclophosphamide oxidase in hepatic microsomes. It is concluded that potentiation of the acute toxicity at a high dose of cyclophosphamide by chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and oxazepam is due to an induction of microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme which are responsible for the in vivo activation of cyclophosphamide.", 
    "25": "Rats were injected systemically with different classes of gabergic agent in order to investigate gabergic involvement in limbic output. Agonists differed one from another in their effects on variable-interval self-stimulation: clonazepam (in repeatedly-tested rats), chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbitone had a strongly biphasic action, low doses being facilitatory and high doses depressant, whereas other agonists including valproate and 3-APS (homotaurine) were uniformly depressant. The facilitatory effects of the benzodiazepines were dramatically enhanced by GABA antagonists (picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol) even though antagonists on their own produced a dose-dependent depression that was not reversible by other anticonvulsant drugs. Ventral tegmental electrode placements yielded generally similar results. Depression of self-stimulation observed on initial exposure to clonazepam was reversed by repeated self-stimulation testing in the drugged state but not by repeated daily injections without testing. Locomotor activity (under conflict-free conditions) was unaffected or was depressed both by agonists and by antagonists. Thus, the facilitation of self-stimulation by chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbitone and clonazepam appears to be accounted for in terms of non-gabergic anti-conflict activity by these agents. Self-stimulation and locomotor changes following systemic administration did not disclose facilitatory effects attributable to gabergic efferents from limbic dopamine areas.", 
    "26": "The pharmacological actions, in vivo, of estazolam and haloxazolam were comparatively studied. Spontaneous discharges of spinal motoneurons in cats were markedly suppressed by estazolam (3 mg/kg, i.d.), but unaffected by similarly administered haloxazolam. The facilitatory effect of stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus on the gamma-activity was suppressed by both haloxazolam and estazolam (3 mg/kg, p.o., for each). The stimulus threshold was raised 1.7 times by haloxazolam and 1.6 times by estazolam. The facilitation of the gamma-activity induced by stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation was also depressed by both drugs. The stimulus threshold was raised 6 times by estazolam, but unchanged by haloxazolam. The spinal monosynaptic reflex was unaffected by haloxazolam, while its amplitude was depressed to a half by estazolam (3 mg/kg, p.o., for each). The facilitation of the monosynaptic reflex induced by conditioning stimulation was depressed by both drugs (3 mg/kg, p.o.), but estazolam showed a stronger suppressive action. The seizure-like responses of spinal motoneurons, which were induced by stimulation of the gastrocnemius nerve following strychnine administration, were unaffected by 30 mg/kg of haloxazolam, while they were suppressed by estazolam of the same dose. Thus, the results of all experiments in the present study indicate that estazolam blocks the descending activating functions of both alpha- and gamma-motor systems, whereas the blockade by haloxazolam is limited only to the gamma-system, and also that the suppressive actions of estazolam on both alpha- and gamma-motor systems are stronger than that of haloxazolam.", 
    "27": "The absorption of triazolam from pelleted drug-diet mixtures by mice under steady-state conditions was determined for doses up to 150 mg/kg/day by measuring alpha-hydroxytriazolam, the principal urinary metabolite of triazolam in the mouse, in urine samples collected over a 24-hour period. Following beta-glucuronide glucuronosohydrolase hydrolysis of the urine, quantitation of alpha-hydroxytriazolam was accomplished using a specific reverse-phase liquid chromatographic method which utilized UV detection at 214 nm. Assay precision was greater than 2.7% (CV) over the concentration range of interest. Statistical analysis of the excretion data indicated that the mathematical relationship between the triazolam dose and the quantity of alpha-hydroxytriazolam excreted was linear for female mice and nonlinear for male mice. Triazolam absorption, as reflected by alpha-hydroxytriazolam urinary excretion data, increased with triazolam dose.", 
    "28": "In a 6-week double-blind trial 129 outpatients with major depressive disorder received either alprazolam, imipramine or placebo. Dosage was adjustable from 0.5 mg alprazolam, 25 mg imipramine or two capsules placebo b.i.d. to 4.5 mg alprazolam, 225 mg imipramine or three capsules placebo t.i.d. Both active drugs were more effective than placebo according to all the rating scales used. Alprazolam and imipramine did not differ consistently except in the somatic symptom cluster on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Mean final daily dosage was 2.7 mg alprazolam, 117.3 mg imipramine and 7.2 capsules placebo. Patients on alprazolam reported fewer side effects than patients on imipramine and approximately the same number as patients on placebo. Anticholinergic side effects were commonly associated with imipramine; drowsiness was the most frequent side effect with alprazolam.", 
    "29": "The effects of temazepam 20 mg, oxazepam 30 mg and placebo were compared when given as preoperative medication to patients undergoing day-case surgery. Temazepam caused a significant decrease in anxiety and produced sedation by 60 min, whereas those patients receiving oxazepam showed only minimal changes. Awakening time was prolonged with oxazepam but not with temazepam. Two hours after surgery, no significant sedation was recorded with either drug, and simple psychomotor testing showed unimpaired performance. Patient acceptability was high with both oxazepam and temazepam.", 
    "30": "Growth hormone and prolactin responses to diazepam were measured in eight male patients who had been receiving long-term treatment with benzodiazepines and eight age-matched drug-free controls. The growth hormone response was significantly attenuated during benzodiazepine administration, but increased significantly after benzodiazepine treatment was discontinued. Growth hormone responses four days after the drug therapy withdrawal in patients, however, were still significantly less than in drug-free controls. Prolactin levels were unaltered after diazepam challenge, both in patients and in controls. The results clearly demonstrate tolerance to the growth hormone-releasing effect of diazepam, but do not suggest receptor supersensitivity after withdrawal of benzodiazepine therapy. It is possible that pituitary mammotropes lack benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "31": "Buspirone hydrochloride, a compound with novel chemical structure, has been reported to be anxiolytic in man. Its mechanism of action as an anxiolytic is unknown, but preclinical studies have shown that it produces effects consistent with both a dopamine agonist and antagonist. In man, buspirone hydrochloride at doses of 30, 60, and 90 mg orally significantly elevated plasma prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) concentrations. The apparent increase in PRL secretion was dose dependent, but that of GH was not. The increase in PRL secretion could be due to a dopamine antagonist effect at the pituitary gland. A dopamine agonist action at hypothalamic dopamine receptors could account for the increase in GH secretion. Benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs also increase serum GH levels in man, by a mechanism that has not been clearly established. It may be that buspirone and benzodiazepine drugs stimulate GH secretion by a common mechanism that is related to their anxiolytic actions.", 
    "32": "Factors influencing the rate and extent of benzodiazepine uptake into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peripheral tissue distribution and electroencephalographic (EEG) effects were evaluated in a model utilizing anesthetized male cats. A single (0.25-10 mg/kg) dose of the following eight benzodiazepines was administered i.v.: diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, midazolam, lorazepam, alprazolam, triazolam, flunitrazepam and clobazam. Multiple samples were simultaneously drawn from arterial blood and cisternal CSF over the next 4 hr and the EEG was continuously monitored. Concentrations of benzodiazepines in plasma and CSF samples were measured by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography and plasma protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis. Physicochemical properties of lipophilicity of each benzodiazepine were determined by measurement of the octanol/buffer partition ratio at physiologic pH and by the high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) retention on a reverse-phase C18 column at neutral pH. Disappearance of all benzodiazepines from plasma was consistent with a linear sum of two or three exponential terms. After correction for individual differences in protein binding, volume of distribution (Vd) of unbound drug was highly correlated with HPLC retention (r = 0.91), but not significantly related to octanol/buffer partition coefficient. Diazepam and midazolam, having the longest HPLC retention also had the largest unbound Vd. All benzodiazepines rapidly entered CSF, with peak concentrations usually attained within 15 min of dosage. More lipophilic drugs tended to enter CSF most rapidly, but associations of entry rate and in vitro lipophilicity were not significant. After distribution equilibrium was attained, disappearance of benzodiazepines from both plasma and CSF occurred in parallel. Equilibrium CSF/total plasma concentration ratios of all drugs were much less than unity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Rats were trained to discriminate between saline and either 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 or 6.0 mg/kg of diazepam in a two-choice, discrete-trial avoidance procedure. Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and pentobarbital occasioned dose-related increases in diazepam-appropriate responding in all four training dose groups. Increasing the training dose of diazepam from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg resulted in approximately a 3-fold shift to the right in the dose-effect curves for each of these four drugs. However, increasing the training dose to 3.0 or 6.0 mg/kg did not result in additional, concomitant shifts in these dose-effect curves. Moreover, the dose-effect curves of nine additional benzodiazepine analogs also did not differ markedly in rats trained with either 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg of diazepam. The nonbenzodiazepines ethanol, phencyclidine, cyproheptadine and ketocyclazocine failed to produce diazepam-like discriminative stimuli in rats trained with either 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg of diazepam. In rats trained with 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam, Ro 11-6896, but not its inactive stereoisomer Ro 11-6893, occasioned diazepam-appropriate responding. Furthermore, the selective benzodiazepine antagonist CGS8216 blocked the effects of diazepam but not the diazepam-like effects of pentobarbital. These results demonstrate that the discriminative effects of diazepam are qualitatively similar across this 20-fold range of training doses; quantitatively, the discriminative effects of diazepam appear to reach a maximum and plateau above a training dose of 1.0 mg/kg in rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Conflicting data concerning the ventilatory effects of benzodiazepines may be caused by the large variability in investigational conditions. Respiratory effects of three different intravenous doses of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg) and placebo were measured in a double-blind and randomized fashion in eight healthy volunteers. The respiratory variables were analyzed by means of a noninvasive method, thereby avoiding interferences associated with the stimulating effects of mouthpiece and nose clip. After injection of midazolam, tidal volume decreased by 40% with the three doses and respiratory frequency increased to the same extent, minute ventilation remained constant. Only the largest dose of the drug produced a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in O2 saturation that was related to the longer duration of apnea. Intravenous naloxone (0.015 mg/kg) injected 5 min after midazolam did not change any measured respiratory or hemodynamic variable. We conclude that the respiratory effects of midazolam are poorly dose related and not reversed by naloxone. The observed compensatory increase in respiratory frequency which is not noted in other studies, is probably related to the noninvasive measurement technique used.", 
    "35": "The inhibition constants of [3H] diazepam specific binding with benzodiazepine receptor by 7-bromo-5-halogenophenyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepines change symbatically with molar extinctions of the longwave maxima in UV spectra, the basicity of these compounds and activity by the assays of antagonism with pentilentetrazol, the potentiation of hexenal sleep and disturbance of orientation reflexes. It has been suggested that anxiolytic, hypnosedative and antipentilentetrazol effects, and to lesser extent anticonvulsive and myorelaxant effects, of benzodiazepines and determined by affinity for benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "36": "A food-reinforced two-lever operant method was used to train rats (n = 10) to discriminate diazepam (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) from saline. Thereafter drugs with supposed agonist and antagonist activity were submitted for test. Pentobarbital was the only agonist able to produce the diazepam discriminative stimulus complex (DSC), while pentylenetetrazol was the only antagonist able to abolish the diazepam DSC. It is concluded that the diazepam DSC is highly specific in this test and is suitable for the investigation of the neuropharmacological action of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "37": "52 patients with acute neurotic anxious and psychosomatic syndromes or chronic anxious and vegetative neuroses were treated orally with the combination drug Betamed (1 tablet contain 60 mg bupranolol and 2.5 mg diazepam). The optimum daily dosage are 2 to 3 tablets; duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. The most responsive target symptoms are psychogenic disorders of the cardiovascular system, anxiety and insomnia, while no antidepressive effect was observed. Clinical improvement is often observed 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of treatment, and dosage reduction is possible frequently. Rarely observed side effects are minimal and mainly occur within one week after onset of treatment. Controls performed 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of treatment revealed reactivation of symptoms only in some patients with chronic anxiety and vegetative syndromes. In addition to the easy application and excellent tolerance of the combination drug emphasis is given on the minimal danger of drug dependence.", 
    "38": "A large body of evidence has suggested a role for the endogenous opiates and their receptors in the regulation of appetite. In this study, we report on the effects of tifluadom, a noval opiate with a benzodiazepine-like structure and preferential activity at the kappa opiate receptor, on ingestive behaviors. Tifluadom increases food intake in rats without altering water intake. Tifluadom's effect on feeding is more potent than that of morphine or ketocyclazocine and equivalent to that of butorphanol. The effect is partially resistant to naloxone antagonism. Tifluadom is more potent when administered subcutaneously than when given intraperitoneally. These data provide further support for the concept that kappa opiate receptors represent an important component of the natural feeding drive.", 
    "39": "Carbamazepine, a drug effective in pain, seizure, and affective disorders, was screened for its ability to interact with a variety of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator binding sites on brain membranes. The most potent effect was observed on adenosine antagonist ( [3H]DPX) binding to the adenosine receptor (KI = 3.5 +/- 0.4 microM) followed by adenosine agonist ( [3H]CHA) binding (KI = 24.5 +/- 3.6 microM). Lower potency effects were observed on benzodiazepine receptors, and no inhibition was seen in a variety of other systems. The inhibition of adenosine receptor binding by carbamazepine was competitive. No correlation was observed between the potency of a series of carbamazepine analogs as inhibitors of either ( [3H]DPX, [3H]CHA or [3H]diazepam binding and their ability to inhibit electroshock-induced convulsions, suggesting that the anticonvulsant properties of these agents are not mediated by the adenosine receptor, but raising the possibility that other clinical effects of carbamazepine may relate to its ability to act at the adenosine receptor.", 
    "40": "The binding of GABA to its central receptor sites and of benzodiazepines to central and peripheral types of binding sites was compared in age-matched spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and normotensive (WKY) rat. The KD and Bmax values of GABA agonist binding were not significantly different between SHR and WKY rat in the forebrain, cerebellum or pons-medulla. The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to central types of binding sites was also not different in 12 week-old SHR and WKY rat. However, the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]RO5-4864 was significantly lower in the SHR kidney, as compared to WKY rat kidney. This decrease was due to a lower Bmax in SHR kidney. In contrast, the binding of these radioligands in the hearts of the two strains was not different. These results indicate that the SHR has lower peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the kidney as compared to age-matched normotensive WKY rat kidney.", 
    "41": "Benzodiazepine (BZ) and GABA receptors are associated in the neuronal membrane. GABA responses are enhanced in the presence of BZs. The convulsant DMCM (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), like other beta-carbolines, binds with high affinity to BZ receptors. The effects of DMCM and of the BZ midazolam, on GABA responses, were studied in mouse cultured neurones using intracellular recording techniques. GABA responses were usually reduced by DMCM and potentiated by midazolam. This, with an occasional direct facilitatory effect on the membrane, is consistent with the convulsive action of DMCM.", 
    "42": "Deltamethrin and three insecticidal cyano analogs causing the Type II pyrethroid syndrome increased the input resistance of crayfish claw opener muscle fibers bathed in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In contrast, two non-toxic stereoisomers and three insecticidal pyrethroids causing the Type I syndrome were inactive. Known GABA antagonists including picrotoxinin (PTX) induced an effect similar to, although quicker than, that caused by the active pyrethroids. Two benzodiazepines reduced the potency of PTX and deltamethrin. Cyanophenoxybenzyl pyrethroids therefore appear to act on the GABA receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "43": "A staircase maze has been used to test the modification induced by a chronic administration of different doses of diazepam in the decay of the rat performance caused by an interruption of 20 days in the daily training. The possibility that behavioral interferences modify the diazepam effect has been examined by testing the rat in an open field or in a Y maze during the interruption of the training in the staircase maze. The diazepam effect on the rat behavior in the staircase maze increased linearly with the doses; an intercalated training in the open field increased the diazepam effect, while an intercalated training in a Y maze completely abolished the increase of forgetting caused by diazepam.", 
    "44": "Membrane conductance changes evoked by bath-applied GABA (2-640 microM) and some related agonists were recorded intracellularly in Xenopus oocytes previously injected with chick brain mRNA. Muscimol and 3-aminopropanesulphonate were approximately 4 and 0.25 times as potent as GABA in producing a conductance increase. GABA responses were antagonized by bicuculline (10 microM) or picrotoxinin (10-100 microM) but were clearly enhanced by the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligand chlorazepate or by pentobarbitone. We conclude that an appropriate fraction of brain mRNA was capable of directing the synthesis and correct insertion of functional GABA-BZ-barbiturate/receptor complexes in the oocyte membrane.", 
    "45": "Since nicotinamide, 6-aminonicotinamide and harmaline can modify the ability of 3-acetylpyridine to cause CNS lesions, and nicotinamide and harmane alkaloids have been proposed as ligands at the benzodiazepine receptor, we have examined the effects of these agents individually or in combinations on [3H]diazepam binding to rat cortex membranes. No interaction was observed between any of the compounds, but 6-aminonicotinamide is over 100-fold more potent than nicotinamide in displacing diazepam.", 
    "46": "The effects of Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, were studied on pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in cats. Ro 15-1788 decreased the number of myoclonic jerks induced by a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol (12.5 mg/kg, i.m.). Ro 15-1788 suppressed generalized convulsive seizures induced by a minimal convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol (25-35 mg/kg), but did not block the effects of higher doses (35-45 mg/kg). These results indicate that Ro 15-1788 is not a pure benzodiazepine antagonist, but has partial agonistic properties.", 
    "47": "Low intravenous doses of two benzodiazepines, lorazepam and diazepam, antagonized the activation of dorsal hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons by kainate to a greater extent than the activations produced by glutamate and acetylcholine. A similar effect was obtained with microiontophoretic application of two water-soluble benzodiazepines, flurazepam and chlordiazepoxide. Chlorpromazine and phenobarbital did not exert any consistent effect on kainate-induced activation. RO 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, prevented the effect of lorazepam on kainate-induced activation. The regional selectivity of this effect was indicated by the failure of lorazepam to produce a sustained reduction of kainate action in the CA3 hippocampal region and in the cerebral cortex. This selective antagonism by benzodiazepines of the excitation of selected limbic neurons via 'kainate-sensitive' receptors might be related to their anxiolytic effect.", 
    "48": "In contrast to analysis for competitive binding in enzyme kinetics, no linear plot for analysing competitive binding of two ligands to a protein, where the concentrations of the three reactants are comparable, seems to exist. In the present communication it is shown that in this situation a linear plot can be obtained by the use of the simple equation VA/VB = KA/KB X [Af]/[Bf], where VA and VB are the average number of moles of ligand A and ligand B bound per mole of protein, respectively; [Af] and [Bf] are the concentrations of free ligand A and free ligand B, respectively; and KA and KB are the corresponding association constants. The plot is commented on both theoretically and experimentally using ligand binding to human serum albumin as an example.", 
    "49": "A diaryltriazine, LY81067, effectively protects against pentylenetetrazole- and picrotoxin-induced convulsions in mice, with ED50 values of 5.7 and 5.8 mg/kg i.p., respectively. LY81067 enhances the binding of both 3H-GABA and 3H-flunitrazepam to specific sites in rat brain membranes. The degree of enhancement by LY81067 varies from one brain region to another and is different for the binding of 3H-GABA and 3H-flunitrazepam. In cortical membranes, LY81067 increases the affinity of 3H-GABA for both high and low affinity sites and increases the number of sites. LY81067 increases the affinity of 3H-flunitrazepam for its binding sites without greatly increasing the number of sites. Like the pyrazolopyridines, the enhancement of 3H-flunitrazepam binding by LY81067 is dependent on chloride or related anions and is reversed by picrotoxin, suggesting that LY81067 exerts its anticonvulsant effects by binding to or near picrotoxin binding sites. The differential effects of LY81067 on the enhancements of 3H-GABA and 3H-flunitrazepam binding in several brain regions suggest extensive multiplicity of GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxin/anioin receptor complexes.", 
    "50": "The binding properties and pharmacological effects of pirenzepine were compared to those of atropine in isolated pancreatic acini and pancreatic membranes of rats. In the first preparation, pirenzepine and atropine blocked [N-methyl-3H]scopolamine ([3H]NMS) binding, pirenzepine being 110 times less potent than atropine (KD for pirenzepine 0.38 microM and for atropine 3.5 microM). A similar difference in potency was observed with respect to carbamylcholine stimulation of amylase secretion (IC50 for pirenzepine 4.5 microM and for atropine 30 nM) and calcium efflux (IC50 for pirenzepine 2.8 microM and for atropine 4 nM). Correspondingly, in rat pancreatic membranes, the KD values for pirenzepine and atropine were 250 and 1.5 nM, respectively. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the in vitro antimuscarinic effect of pirenzepine on the rat pancreas is linked to the occupancy of a single homogeneous class of receptors with a low affinity for the antagonist.", 
    "51": "The value of a test-strip for the rapid determination of alpha-amylase in urine (Rapignost-Amylase) was tested at eleven different centres in four countries (Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland) on a total of 1294 urine samples. Results were compared with those obtained by chromolytic and saccharogenic methods. The analytical efficiency of amylase determination in urine with the test-strip was 96%. There were 3.7% false-positive and 0.4% false-negative results. The test-strip readings were not influenced by erythrocytes or haemoglobin, glucose, protein, urobilinogen, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, codeine, amphetamine and ascorbic acid. Only bilirubin in very dark urine samples interfered with a correct reading of the test-strip.", 
    "52": "Thirty physicians in a university family medicine teaching practice were asked to estimate their rate of prescribing diazepam to six age/sex groupings of patients within their practice. Their actual prescribing rates as recorded by a computerized data collection system were not accurately perceived. After the physicians were informed of the gap between perceived and actual prescribing, significant changes in prescribing behavior occurred. Awareness of a perception-reality gap in primary care practice prescribing offers a method of continuing medical education that may significantly alter prescribing behavior in ways beneficial to patient care.", 
    "53": "Longstanding concern about possible misuse of the physician's unique prerogative to prescribe sedative drugs that control behavior has been accentuated by the increasing use of benzodiazepines since 1960. The appropriateness of their use in solving psychosocial predicaments is increasingly questioned because their availability has coincided with social movements toward personal autonomy and scientific doubts about the adequacy of a biomedical model in health care. Recent information about patients, physicians' prescribing habits, and drugs leads to an exploration of the existing alternatives. Adoption of a biopsychosocial model could result in lowered drug use with increased levels of public and professional satisfaction.", 
    "54": "The pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepine antitumor antibiotic, anthramycin, shares a number of toxicities with the widely used anticancer agent adriamycin. We investigated whether acute doses of anthramycin and the structurally related compounds, sibiromycin and tomaymycin, would depress P-450-dependent drug biotransformations as has been reported for adriamycin. Alterations in drug metabolism rates were determined in rats using 50 and 75% of the approximate 7-day LD50 determined in mice. 4 days post dosing ethylmorphine demethylase and aniline hydroxylase activities in liver 9000 g supernatant were depressed from 26 to 76%. Tomaymycin lowered drug metabolism in a dose-related manner, while sibiromycin produced the greatest amount of depression. Like adriamycin, the pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepines possess the ability to depress hepatic drug metabolism and therefore may affect the disposition of compounds with which they are co-administered.", 
    "55": "The content of adenylic nucleotides (ATP, ADP and AMP) in different structures of the rat brain (cortex, limbic system, medulla oblongata) was studied in experimental chronic stress (anxiety) as was its correction with psychotropic agents--the derivatives of different chemical compounds. Stress was shown to lead to a dramatic decrease in the content of macroergic constituents in an excess-catabolic stage, largely at the expense of ATP, thereby reducing the adenylate charge. These changes were the most demonstrable in the limbic system. The medulla oblongata was little responsive to stress in this stage. Prophylactic administrations of the tranquilizers exerted a pronounced stress-protective action and made the content of macroergic constituents return to normal. GABA and nicotinic acid derivatives had the highest therapeutic effect.", 
    "56": "Diazepam was administered to gravid rat dams on days 13 through 20 of gestation, at either 1 or 5 mg/kg/day. Pups were observed on several behavioral paradigms throughout the preweaning period. The high dose resulted in a failure to maintain weight gain at the same rate as controls. Additionally, this dose produced a deficit in the ability of 8-day-old pups to autonomically thermoregulate. Female littermates of these pups displayed altered habituation behavior on a holeboard apparatus when tested on postnatal day 12 (PN 12). The low dose attenuated the normal drop in body temperature produced by removal of the pup from its home cage on PN8. This dose also slightly decreased responding on a photocell activity task on PN15. Neither dose was found to affect muscle strength, as measured by hang time. The results suggest that the postnatal effects of prenatal diazepam exposure are dose-specific, in that low dose treatment leads to a different type of behavioral consequence than does exposure to higher doses.", 
    "57": "The pre- and postnatal effects of the combined oral administration of propoxyphene (PPX, 100 mg/kg/day) and chlordiazepoxide (CDX, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day) were evaluated in Wistar rats in separate experiments by dosing on days 6 through 21 of pregnancy. The controls were given either an aqueous gum tragacanth solution or PPX alone. Maternal toxicity, as evident from death or reduction in body weight, was observed in dams given PPX + 100 mg/kg/day CDX, although previous studies with CDX alone showed no maternal toxicity [5]. PPX alone was well tolerated by the mothers and produced neither any detrimental effects on litter size, litter or pup weights, nor any visceral or skeletal anomalies. Treatment with the two largest doses of CDX + PPX was associated with a high incidence of resorptions, a significant reduction in fetal weight, increased incidence of runts, retarded ossification of skull bones, and a variety of sternal defects. In the postnatal study, PPX alone did not affect pup survival or growth, whereas the combined dosing of PPX and CDX resulted in delayed delivery, increase in stillbirths, reduction in birth weight and a high neonatal mortality compared to pups in the control groups. Pentobarbital sleeping time remained unaltered in 11 to 12-week old offspring of dams given PPX alone. However, in 11 to 12-week old progeny exposed in utero to 25 mg/kg CDX + PPX, the pentobarbital sleeping time was significantly prolonged in males but shortened in females, suggesting that prenatal exposure to PPX + CDX caused a sex-related reversal to pentobarbital hypnosis in mature rats.", 
    "58": "The metabolism of 14C-loprazolam has been studied in rat, dog and man in vivo. In rat, the major metabolic pathways were hydroxylation on the benzodiazepine ring, and reduction and acetylation of the nitro group. Both metabolites were identified by co-chromatography with standards, and were present in urine and bile conjugated with glucuronic acid. In both dog and human urine and bile significant amounts of the piperazine-N-oxide were found. This N-oxide was identified by co-chromatography with authentic compound and by mass spectroscopy. Both loprazolam and the dog biliary metabolites were hydrolysed spontaneously to polar material. Neither treatment with beta-glucuronidase nor incubation with gut microflora had any further effect. Only polar metabolites were found in dog and human faeces. The principal non-polar material found in rat plasma was the diazepine-hydroxy compound, and little loprazolam was present. Significant levels of loprazolam and lower levels of an unidentified metabolite were found in ether extracts of dog and human plasma. Both the piperazine-N-oxide and loprazolam were found in similar quantities in chloroform extracts of human plasma, and at two hours after dosage, the N-oxide and loprazolam accounted for greater than 90% of the radioactivity present in the plasma.", 
    "59": "The metabolism of loprazolam by rat- and dog-liver preparations has been studied in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Identification of unchanged loprazolam and metabolites was by comparison of chromatographic characteristics and mass spectra with those of authentic compounds. The piperazine-N-oxide was the sole metabolite formed under aerobic conditions in dog-liver slices and microsomes. In addition to this N-oxide, the N-desmethyl metabolite and the diazepine-hydroxy metabolite were formed in rat-liver microsomes. The principal metabolite in rat-liver slices was the glucuronide of the hydroxy compound. Under anaerobic conditions the nitro group of loprazolam is reduced to the amine by dog-liver slices and rat-liver microsomes.", 
    "60": "This study evaluates the hypothesis that ethanol alone, or in diluents for drugs used to protect hypoxic mice, is responsible in part for an increased tolerance to hypoxia (4-5% oxygen). The change in hypoxic tolerance following i.v. or i.p. administration of ethanol, diazepam, nimodipine and various diluent components was measured. Diazepam (50 mg/kg i.v.) increased hypoxic tolerance to 700 +/- 47% (n = 11) of saline control, its diluent increased hypoxic tolerance to 468 +/- 60% (n = 10) of saline control but the ethanol component of the diluent accounted for almost half of this diluent effect. Nimodipine (2 mg/kg i.p.), a calcium antagonist, increased tolerance to 180 +/- 18% of control (n = 19) and nimodipine diluent showed an even greater increase to 226 +/- 25% of control (n = 15). In this case essentially all of the protective effect of nimodipine diluent (81.3%) is accounted for by ethanol. Dose response curves indicate the maximum ethanol induced increase in hypoxic tolerance was approximately 335% of control at a dose of 2.4 g/kg. Buffers, etc. in the diluents evidently add to the protective effect of ethanol. Our data clearly indicate ethanol is the important component of some treatments which protect mice from hypoxia. The pharmacological activity of ethanol, even when used in a diluent, should not be ignored in evaluating therapeutic intervention for protection from hypoxia.", 
    "61": "Anticonvulsant activities of diazepam in mice given pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), as well as effects of diazepam against potentiating activities of caffeine on these convulsions, were studied. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings and behavioral observations were employed. First spike, clonic and tonic convulsions induced by PTZ were readily recognized from the EEG recording coupled with EMG recording. Pretreatment of mice with diazepam suppressed the incidence of clonic and tonic convulsions, but did not affect the development of first spike. These anticonvulsive effects of diazepam were also observed when PTZ-induced convulsions were potentiated with caffeine, except for clonic convulsion which was not suppressed with diazepam. The mechanisms of the antagonistic effects between diazepam and caffeine are discussed.", 
    "62": "A six-year study of therapeutic and toxic drug concentrations in the blood from medical examiner's cases in the State of Maryland is reported. Statistical means, ranges, and number of cases are presented for three categories of cases; single drug deaths (53 drugs and 5 metabolites), multiple drug deaths (40 drugs and 5 drug metabolites), and non-drug related deaths (49 drugs and 5 metabolites). Results are compared to previous studies from the literature to facilitate, augment, and improve the understanding of the concentrations of drugs consistent with therapy or death.", 
    "63": "Exposure of the rat brain to estradiol is known to modify certain neurotransmitter binding sites. We have now examined the influence of long-term (3 months) treatment with this steroid. Opiate and benzodiazepine receptors are both elevated in hypothalamus but not in amygdala or cerebral cortex. In contrast, the affinity, but not maximum binding, of hypothalamic beta-adrenergic sites is reduced 5-fold. Our results confirm and extend previous reports that hypothalamic neurotransmitter binding sites are particularly sensitive to estrogen feedback.", 
    "64": "A series of studies demonstrated a possible relationship between eye-blink rate and central dopamine activity. First, apomorphine and other dopamine agonists acutely increased blink rate in monkeys, an effect blocked by sulpiride. Secondly, parkinsonian patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia exhibited twice the mean blink rate (21 blinks/min) of other parkinsonians (11 blinks/min, P less than 0.002) whereas the more symptomatic of the nondyskinetic patients had a very slow rate (3 blinks/min, P less than 0.01). Thirdly, schizophrenic patients had an elevated mean blink (31 vs 23 blinks/min for normals, P less than 0.05) which was normalized by neuroleptic treatment. Thus, the correlation with central dopamine activity may also prove clinically useful in selected neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "65": "Rats were trained to discriminate between the stimulus properties of intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg phenytoin and its pH-adjusted vehicle in a two-lever, food-motivated operant task. Once trained, rats showed a dose-related decrease in discriminative performance with lower phenytoin doses. Administration of pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide produced vehicle-appropriate responding, whereas injection of imipramine and amitriptyline produced intermediate results. Desipramine, at an intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg, produced a pattern of responding similar to that observed after the training dose of phenytoin. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of a non-disruptive dose of phenytoin to act as a behavioral discriminative stimulus in the rat and suggest the possibility of a common interoceptive cue property with tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "66": "Several dyes, representing different structural classes, inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding to brain specific receptors in the rat with 50% inhibition in the 1 to 100 microM range. Crystal Violet and Methyl Violet 2B inhibited more potently in the forebrain than in the cerebellum. Congo Red yielded a Hill number near 2.3, probably reflecting positive cooperativity between interacting binding sites in benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Toluidine Blue 0 was the most potent of the dyes tested (IC50 = 1 microM in cerebellum) and inhibited more potently in cerebellum than in forebrain.", 
    "67": "The frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the Fischer 344 rat were examined for an age-dependent change in neuronal and non-neuronal binding. Clonazepam and Ro5-6669 displaceable [3H]diazepam binding were used as indicators of [3H]diazepam binding on neuronal and non-neuronal membranes, respectively. In both the frontal cortex and the hippocampus, clonazepam displaceable [3H]diazepam binding in the senescent rat was significantly less than the young and mature rat. In the frontal cortex, Ro5-6669 did not significantly displace [3H]diazepam binding in any age group. The Ro5-6669 displaceable [3H]diazepam binding in the hippocampus was not altered with age. In the cerebellum clonazepam and Ro5-6669 displaceable binding in the old rat was significantly less and more, respectively, compared to the young rat."
