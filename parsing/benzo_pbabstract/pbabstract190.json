The study cohort consisted of 29,005 women who had live births in the period between January 2000 and July 2003. Antidepressant drug use during a specified period was defined as there being a record of a prescription during that period.", 
    "7": "During the first trimester of pregnancy 2% of all pregnant women of the study cohort were found to have taken antidepressants; in the second and third trimesters, this figure had dropped to 1.8% of all pregnancies. Antidepressant use before as well as during pregnancy was almost twofold higher in women over 35 years of age than in those under 35 years. Almost 60% of the women who used antidepressants before pregnancy stopped taking them in the first trimester, and a smaller number stopped thereafter. Of all women using antidepressants during pregnancy, one third started this medication during gestation. In the 3 months following delivery, the prevalence of antidepressant use was the same as before pregnancy (2.9%). There was no shift to benzodiazepines in the group of women who stopped taking antidepressants during pregnancy. Although paroxetine and fluoxetine were the most frequently used antidepressants among the study group, all modern antidepressants were used.", 
    "8": "A considerable number of women are being exposed to antidepressants throughout pregnancy up until delivery. One consequence of this is that their newborns need special care and supervision during the first days of life. However, women who stop taking the medication may risk a relapse of their illness, and this may also have a negative effect on the child.", 
    "9": "Second-generation atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, amisulpride and ariprazole offer the potential to reduce the significant health care resource demands in the treatment of schizophrenia through improved levels of initial clinical response and reduced levels of long-term acute relapse. However, the optimal sequencing of these drugs remains unclear. To consider this issue from a health economic viewpoint a decision model approach was used comparing healthcare costs and clinical outcomes when treating patients with alternative sequences of atypical antipsychotic treatment. Treated patients were assumed to be in a current acute episode with at least a 10-year history of disease and to be naive to previous atypical treatments. Treatment strategies were based on either first-line olanzapine or risperidone with switching to the alternative drug as second-line treatment following an inadequate clinical response to first-line drug therapy. Clinical response data were derived from a pivotal published comparative study of both olanzapine and risperidone. Published data on the long-term use of antipsychotic drugs where used wherever possible to populate the model for relapse rates during the maintenance phase. Health care resource data were defined for Germany based on expert clinical opinion. A treatment strategy of first-line olanzapine was shown to be cost saving over a 1-year period, with additional clinical benefits in the form of avoided relapses. The model suggests that over the first year of treatment a strategy of first-line olanzapine is associated with lower risk of additional relapse (0.33 fewer acute relapses per 100 patients per year) and with cost savings (euro 35,306 per 100 patients per year). There is a need for longer term direct in-trial comparisons of atypical antipsychotics to confirm these indicative results.", 
    "10": "To identify metabolic features that support the aggressive behavior of human neuroendocrine (NE) cancers, we examined metastatic prostate NE tumors and derived prostate NE cancer (PNEC) cell lines from a transgenic mouse model using a combination of magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, in silico predictions of biotransformations that observed metabolites may undergo, biochemical tests of these predictions, and electrophysiological/calcium imaging studies. Malignant NE cells undergo excitation and increased proliferation when their GABA(A), glutamate, and/or glycine receptors are stimulated, use glutamate and GABA as substrates for NADH biosynthesis, and produce propylene glycol, a precursor of pyruvate derived from glycine that increases levels of circulating free fatty acids through extra-NE cell effects. Treatment of nude mice containing PNEC tumor xenografts with (i) amiloride, a diuretic that inhibits Abp1, an enzyme involved in NE cell GABA metabolism, (ii) carbidopa, an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase which functions upstream of Abp1, plus (iii) flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist that binds to GABA(A) receptors, leads to significant reductions in tumor growth. These findings may be generally applicable: GeneChip data sets from 471 human neoplasms revealed that components of GABA metabolic pathways, including ABP1, exhibit statistically significant increases in their expression in NE and non-NE cancers.",

Combining these data with prevalence information and a range of plausible associations with mortality, the confounding rate ratio was estimated. This parameter is the ratio of the unadjusted long sleep-mortality rate ratio to the rate ratio adjusted for the factor and measures the extent that the factor can alter the long sleep-mortality association, either through confounding or as a causal intermediate. Based on this parameter, psychiatric and socioeconomic factors have the greatest potential to influence the long sleep-mortality relationship. Assuming each factor doubles mortality risk, the confounding rate ratios for depression, antidepressant use, and unemployment were 1.10, 1.18, and 1.12. Lesser influential factors were benzodiazepine use, poverty, low societal status, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity.",

A standardized general anaesthesia was performed, including benzodiazepine premedication, propofol, rocuronium, desflurane in air/O2, fentanyl or sufentanil followed by a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Post-operative analgesia and anti-emetic rescue medication were standardized. The main outcome measures were the severity of PONV within the first 24 h (rated by a standardized scoring algorithm).

The incidence of PONV of any severity was 59.2%, 37.5%, 40% and 22.8%, respectively. The reduction of the incidence and the severity of PONV were statistically significant with all three interventions. Results from additional analyses suggested that both drugs were equally effective and that there was a simple additive effect of tropisetron and dexamethasone compared with placebo.",

The latter could be reduced by approximately 35% in a population of moderate-high risk for PONV. Both drugs had an additive effect.

    "25": "Triazolam caused no significant increase in the total error at 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg. However, at 0.2 mg/kg, it caused a significant increase in total error. Almost the same findings were observed with brotizolam and rilmazafone. That is, at 0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg of brotizolam, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg of rilmazafone caused no significant increase in the total error. However, brotizolam at 1.0 mg/kg and rilmazafone at 2.0 mg/kg caused a significant increase in total error. Triazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and ethanol (1.0 g/kg) showed no significant effect on the numbers of errors when used alone separately, but the simultaneous use of triazolam and ethanol caused a significant increase in total error. Almost the same findings were observed with the coadministration of brotizolam (0.2 mg/kg) or rilmazafone (0.5 mg/kg) with ethanol. These results clearly indicate that all the short-acting benzodiazepines used in the study showed potentiation by ethanol in spatial memory deficits in mice.", 
    "26": "The effect of ageing on CYP3A2, a male specific isoform, was examined in adult (9 months) and senescent (24 months) male rats. A significant decrease (65%) of CYP3A2-related activity (midazolam oxidation) was observed in all senescent rats. Half of these rats still express CYP3A2 suggesting that decreased activities in these rats are due to post-translational modifications. The other senescent male rats did not express CYP3A2 anymore, indicating an impairment of transcription. These transcriptional modifications are due to the previously shown continuous secretion of GH in senescent male rats. GH also regulates HNF4alpha, a hepatocyte nuclear factor, essential for the basal transcriptional activation of the CYP3A2 gene. In senescent rats, a drastic reduction (76%) of HNF4alpha protein content and a decrease in DNA binding activity were observed. When these parameters were assessed in male and female rats of the same age (3 months), a higher HNF4alpha DNA binding activity and a higher HNF4alpha protein content (38%) were observed in female rats. Our results show that in male senescent rats (1) the decrease of HNF4alpha is not consistent with the continuous secretion of GH, and (2) the suppression of CYP3A2 expression is not dependent to the HNF4alpha binding activity.", 
    "27": "There are several different experimental systems for screening of in vitro inhibitory potency of drugs under development. In this study we compared three different types of cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition tests: the traditional single substrate assays, the fluorescent probe method with recombinant human CYPs, and a novel n-in-one technique. All major hepatic drug-metabolizing CYPs were included (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4). Six compounds (sotalol, propranolol, citalopram, fluoxetine, oxazepam and diazepam) were selected for detailed comparisons. The IC50 values of each of these compounds were measured using the three assay types. The inhibitory potencies of these model drugs were generally within the same order of magnitude and followed similar inhibition profiles in all the assay types. Clinically observed inhibitory interactions, or lack thereof, were predictable with all three assays. Comparison of potencies of 'diagnostic' inhibitors revealed also some notable differences between the assays, especially regarding CYP2E1. The potency of inhibitors towards CYP3A4 was dependent on the substrate and reaction measured. Generally all three assays gave reasonably comparable results, although some unexplained differences were also noted.",

    "39": "This review examines the relationship between sleep and depression. Most depressive disorders are characterized by subjective sleep disturbances, and the regulation of sleep is intricately linked to the same mechanisms that are implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. After briefly reviewing the physiology and topography of normal sleep, the disturbances revealed in studies of sleep in depression using polysomnographic recordings and neuroimaging assessments are discussed. Next, treatment implications of the disturbances are reviewed at both clinical and neurobiologic levels. Most antidepressant medications suppress rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, although this effect is neither necessary nor sufficient for clinical efficacy. Effects on patients' difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep are more specific to particular types of antidepressants. Ideally, an effective antidepressant will result in normalization of disturbed sleep in concert with resolution of the depressive syndrome, although few interventions actually restore decreased slow-wave sleep. Antidepressants that block central histamine 1 and serotonin 2 tend to have stronger effects on sleep maintenance, but are also prone to elicit complaints of daytime sedation. Adjunctive treatment with sedative hypnotic medications--primarily potent, shorter-acting benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA A)-selective compounds such as zolpidem--are often used to treat associated insomnia more rapidly. Cognitive behavioral therapy and other nonpharmacologic strategies are also helpful.", 
    "40": "Few studies have assessed the comparative efficacy and safety of atypical and typical antipsychotic medications in patients within their first episode of psychosis. This study examined the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol in patients experiencing their first episode of a schizophrenia-related psychotic disorder over a 2-year treatment period. Two hundred and sixty-three patients were randomized to olanzapine or haloperidol in a doubleblind, multisite, international 2-year study. Clinical symptoms and side effects were assessed at baseline and longitudinally following randomization for the duration of the study. Olanzapine and haloperidol treatment were both associated with substantial and comparable reductions in symptom severity (the primary outcome measure) over the course of the study. However, the treatment groups differed on two secondary efficacy measures. Patients were less likely to discontinue treatment with olanzapine than with haloperidol: mean time (in days) in the study was significantly greater for those treated with olanzapine compared to haloperidol (322.09 vs. 230.38, p<0.0085). Moreover, remission rates were greater in patients treated with olanzapine as compared to those treated with haloperidol (57.25% vs. 43.94%, p<0.036). While extrapyramidal side effects were greater in those treated with haloperidol, weight gain, cholesterol level and liver function values were greater in patients treated with olanzapine. The data from this study suggest some clinical benefits for olanzapine as compared to haloperidol in first episode patients, which must be weighed against those adverse effects that are more likely with olanzapine.",

The present work provides evidence of differences in the learning abilities of the two strains. Three different learning tasks were used: spatial delayed discrimination on the 4-hole board, a learned choice between a lit and a dark compartment in a T-maze, and place-learning in an 8-arm radial maze.

    "48": "A deficiency of most current drug products for treatment of acute conditions is slow onset of action. A promising means of accelerating drug action is through rapid systemic drug administration via deep lung inhalation. The speed of pulmonary drug absorption depends on the site of aerosol deposition within the lung and the dissolution rate and drug content of the deposited particles. Alveolar delivery of fast-dissolving, pure drug particles should in theory enable very rapid absorption. We have previously shown that heating of thin drug films generates vapor-phase drug that subsequently cools and condenses into pure drug particles of optimal size for alveolar delivery. Here we present a hand held, disposable, breath-actuated device incorporating this thermal aerosol technology, and its application to the delivery of alprazolam, an anti-panic agent, and prochlorperazine, an anti-emetic with recently discovered anti-migraine properties. Thermal aerosol particles of these drugs exist in an amorphous state, which results in remarkably rapid drug absorption from the lung into the systemic circulation, with peak left ventricular concentrations achieved within 20 s, even quicker than following rapid (5 s) intravenous infusion. Absorption of the thermal aerosol is nearly complete, with >80% absolute bioavailability found in both dogs and human normal volunteers.",

The permeability (Papp) of diazepam (DIA) was assessed across excised rat jejunum in the absence (Pappcontrol) and presence (Pappuncorr) of polysorbate-80 (PS-80). The micellar association constant (Ka) of DIA, estimated via equilibrium solubility studies, was used to correct Pappuncorr data and obtain an estimate of the true permeability coefficient (Pappcorr). An alternate approach was also developed (the reciprocal permeability approach) to allow direct estimation of Pappcorr without the need for independent estimation of Ka. The approach was further examined experimentally using a range of model drugs. DIA Pappcorr values obtained using the Ka from equilibrium solubility studies deviated from Papp(control) values, especially at PS-80 concentrations above 0.1% w/v. In contrast, data obtained using the reciprocal permeability method were consistent with Pappcontrol across the PS-80 concentration range. Similar trends were observed with propranolol (PRO), antipyrine (ANT), naproxen (NAP), and cinnarizine (CIN). The reciprocal permeability approach therefore provides a simple and accurate method by which the permeability of poorly water-soluble compounds may be estimated under solubilizing conditions.", 
    "68": "Insomnia is one of the most common complaints faced in clinical practice. The limited pharmacological options available make the treatment of this complaint a challenge. All of the available benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics have the potential to induce addiction, cause withdrawal symptoms, or trigger rebound insomnia. Further, the evidence supporting the utility of commonly prescribed options such as antidepressants and antipsychotics is limited. Melatonin is a hormone that has been associated with soporific effects. Based on this premise, a melatonin receptor agonist was created. Ramelteon was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2005 and is the only medication indicated for the long-term treatment of insomnia. A critical review with a clinical perspective of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted to determine the efficacy of melatonin and ramelteon for the treatment of insomnia. Based on this review, it appears that more placebo-controlled trials are indicated before valid judgments concerning the efficacy of both melatonin and ramelteon can be made. In the meantime, there is some support for the use of melatonin for the treatment of insomnia, and findings concerning ramelteon also appear promising. Nevertheless, clinicians who prescribe melatonin or ramelteon should be cautious and carefully monitor both potential benefits and adverse effects, since data on melatonin are based on studies with multiple limitations and only three controlled trials have been done with ramelteon.",

The procedure was performed 4 times on each cat during different sedative and anesthetic protocols in a rotating schedule as follows: propofol, ketamine-midazolam-atropine, ketaminemidazolam, and medetomidine. Regions of interest were drawn around thyroid and salivary glands and counts corrected for background and decay. Percentage of (99m)TcO(4)(-) uptake in salivary and thyroid glands and thyroid-to-salivary gland (99m)TcO(4)(-) uptake ratio were calculated at 20 and 40 minutes.

We have shown previously that mice lacking the epsilon-isoform of PKC (PKCepsilon) self-administer 75% less ethanol and exhibit supersensitivity to acute ethanol and allosteric positive modulators of GABA(A) receptors when compared with wild-type controls. The purpose of the present study was to examine involvement of PKCepsilon in GABA(A) receptor regulation of voluntary ethanol drinking. To address this question, PKCepsilon null-mutant and wild-type control mice were allowed to drink ethanol (10% v/v) vs. water on a two-bottle continuous access protocol. The effects of diazepam (nonselective GABA(A) BZ positive modulator), zolpidem (GABA(A) alpha1 agonist), L-655,708 (BZ-sensitive GABA(A) alpha5 inverse agonist), and flumazenil (BZ antagonist) were then tested on ethanol drinking. Ethanol intake (grams/kg/day) by wild-type mice decreased significantly after diazepam or zolpidem but increased after L-655,708 administration. Flumazenil antagonized diazepam-induced reductions in ethanol drinking in wild-type mice. However, ethanol intake by PKCepsilon null mice was not altered by any of the GABAergic compounds even though effects were seen on water drinking in these mice. Increased acute sensitivity to ethanol and diazepam, which was previously reported, was confirmed in PKCepsilon null mice. Thus, results of the present study show that PKCepsilon null mice do not respond to doses of GABA(A) BZ receptor ligands that regulate ethanol drinking by wild-type control mice. This suggests that PKCepsilon may be required for GABA(A) receptor regulation of chronic ethanol drinking.", 
    "75": "Although preclinical studies suggest that GHB has low likelihood for abuse, case reports indicate that GHB is abused. This study evaluated the relative abuse liability of GHB in 14 volunteers with histories of drug abuse. Psychomotor, subjective, and cognitive effects of a broad range of GHB doses (2-18 g/70 kg), up to a dose that produced severe behavioral impairment in each participant, were compared to placebo and two abused sedative/hypnotic drugs, triazolam (0.5 and 1 mg/70 kg) and pentobarbital (200 and 400 mg/70 kg), under double-blind, double-dummy conditions at a residential research facility. In general, GHB produced effects similar to triazolam and pentobarbital, although GHB was not identified as a benzodiazepine or barbiturate by participants that correctly identified triazolam and pentobarbital as such. On most measures of likelihood of abuse (eg ratings of liking, reinforcing effects), effects of pentobarbital were significantly greater than those of triazolam, with GHB being intermediate. GHB produced significantly greater negative subjective effects, including nausea, than the other drugs. Memory impairment after GHB was less than that after triazolam and pentobarbital. Within participants, the dose-effect function for sedation was steeper for GHB than for triazolam and pentobarbital. Also, at higher doses, GHB was associated with greater sedation and more variability across participants in sedation. Taken together, these data suggest that the profile of effects of GHB only partially overlaps with that of triazolam and pentobarbital. Although the likelihood for GHB to be abused is intermediate to triazolam and pentobarbital, the possibility of accidental overdose (ie greater sedation than intended) with GHB appears to be greater.",

This study surveys buprenorphine related deaths in Singapore between September 2003 and December 2004. The aims are to establish the autopsy prevalence of buprenorphine related deaths and the demographical and toxicological profile of the cases. Toxicological screening was performed for all unnatural deaths, deaths involving known drug addicts, as well as when autopsy revealed no obvious cause of death. Twenty-one cases had buprenorphine detected in post-mortem blood and/or urine samples. Eighteen were sudden deaths. There were two fatal falls from height and one death by hanging. All subjects were male. The age range was 24-48 years. Fourteen subjects were between 30 and 39 years of age. The mean age was 35 years. The majority (62%) were Chinese. Eleven (52%) were known drug abusers. For sudden deaths, two groups were identified. Six cases died from natural causes. Blood buprenorphine levels ranged from undetected (detected in urine) to 3.2 ng/mL (mean 1.4 ng/mL). Twelve cases were attributed directly and indirectly to mixed drug poisoning. Blood buprenorphine levels ranged from undetected (detected in urine) to 17 ng/mL (mean 3.2 ng/mL). Nineteen cases showed concurrent abuse of buprenorphine and benzodiazepine, diazepam being the most frequently detected, followed by nitrazepam and midazolam. The availability of buprenorphine as substitution therapy is associated with an increase in buprenorphine related deaths. The danger of co-abuse of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines is highlighted.", 
    "77": "1 The aim of the present work was to examine the role of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) on DNA synthesis and CD40 expression in human fibroblast cells. Neonatal human skin fibroblast cultures were stimulated with carbachol in presence or absence of specific antagonists and the following parameters were measured: identification of mAChR subtypes, DNA synthesis, inositol phosphates (InsP) production and CD40 expression. 2 Human fibroblasts express mAChR with Kd 0.47 +/- 0.11 nm and Bmax 236 +/- 22 fmol mg protein(-1). Carbachol stimulates DNA synthesis, InsP and the expression of CD40. All these effects were inhibited by atropine, mustard hydrochloride (4-DAMP) and pirenzepine but not by AF-DX 116 and tropicamide, indicating that M3 and M1 mAChR are implicated in carbachol action. The relative Ki of the antagonists obtained by competition binding assay was in parallel to the relative potency for blocking both carbachol-stimulated InsP accumulation and DNA synthesis. 3 The intracellular pathway leading to carbachol-induced biological effects involved phospholipase C and calcium/calmodulin, as U-73122 and trifluoroperazine blocked carbachol effects, respectively. Calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, had no effect, indicating that this enzyme does not participate in the system. 4 These results may contribute to a better understanding of the modulatory role of the parasympathetic muscarinic system on normal human fibroblast function.", 
    "78": "1 In the bovine ciliary muscle, stimulation of muscarinic receptors with carbachol (CCh) opens two types of non-selective cation channels (NSCCS and NSCCL) with widely different unitary conductances (100 fS and 35 pS). Here we examined the dependence of the activity of NSCCS on the agonist (CCh) concentration by whole-cell voltage clamp in freshly isolated bovine ciliary muscle cells. We also examined the sensitivity of CCh-evoked NSCCS currents to several muscarinic receptor antagonists. 2 The voltage clamp experiments were carried out using Ba2+ as the charge carrier, as this divalent cation is the most permeant for NSCCS of the alkali and alkaline earth metal ions hitherto examined, whereas it is relatively impermeant to NSCCL. For the dose-activation relationship obtained, the apparent dissociation constant K was estimated to be 0.5 +/- 0.2 microm (n = 31), a value of an order of magnitude smaller than the one reported for CCh-evoked NSCCL currents in our previous experiments. 3 In the dose-inhibition experiments we observed that the CCh-evoked NSCCS currents were inhibited by the muscarinic antagonists with the following potency sequence: atropine approximately 4-DAMP > pirenzepine > AF-DX116, indicating that the activation of NSCCS by CCh is mediated by an M3 muscarinic receptor. 4 We have previously shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction that the bovine ciliary muscle contains mRNAs for several transient receptor potential channel homologues (TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4 and TRPC6) which are attracting attention as molecular candidates for receptor-operated NSCCs. In the present experiments, we succeeded in visually identifying these TRPCs in the plasma membrane of cultured bovine ciliary muscle cells by immunofluorescence microscopy.", 
    "79": "1 Relaxation responses of the rat isolated duodenum to the putative M1 muscarinic receptor agonist, McN-A-343, were examined to determine whether the response was due to the release of known non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic relaxant neurotransmitters and to establish the involvement of M1 muscarinic receptors. 2 The role of ATP was examined with the P2 receptor antagonist, suramin, which at 30 mum antagonized the relaxant responses to alpha,beta-methylene ATP. The same dose, however, failed to inhibit the relaxation by McN-A-343. 3 The role of nitric oxide (NO) was examined with the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 microm), which failed to inhibit the responses to McN-A-343. As NO mediates relaxation of the duodenum via cGMP generation through guanylyl cyclase, whether the relaxation by McN-A-343 was also via cGMP was examined with the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). The relaxation responses to the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine, were inhibited in the presence of ODQ (3 microm), but not those by McN-A-343. 4 Release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was examined with the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (10 microm), which shifted the concentration-response curves for the relaxation of the duodenum by GABA to the right. There was a similar degree of shift in the concentration-response curve for McN-A-343 by bicuculline indicating that release of GABA from enteric neurones of the duodenum could explain the relaxation response to McN-A-343. 5 To test whether the muscarinic receptors mediating the relaxation of the duodenum were of the M1 subtype, the susceptibility to the selective competitive antagonist, pirenzepine and the selective muscarinic toxin from green mamba, MT7, was examined. Pirenzepine (1 microm) shifted the concentration-response for McN-A-343 to the right in a parallel fashion with a dose ratio of 33.3 +/- 20.2. This yielded a pA2 value of 7.5, which concords with those for other responses reputed to be mediated via M1 muscarinic receptors. The toxin MT7 was used as an irreversible antagonist and following incubation with the duodenum was washed from the bath. An incubation time of 30 min with 100 nm of MT7 caused a significant parallel shift in the concentration-response to McN-A-343 confirming the involvement of M1 muscarinic receptors. 6 This study has confirmed that McN-A-343 relaxes the rat duodenum via muscarinic receptors of the M1 subtype and that these receptors are probably located on enteric neurones from which their stimulation releases GABA.",

On the background of antagonist action, piracetam inhibited the effects of flumazenil (but not those of bicuculline and picrotoxin).

Previous studies in rodents have demonstrated reproductive experience, i.e. pregnancy and lactation, can alter sensitivity to certain drugs, such as morphine. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether reproductive experience alters sensitivity to the benzodiazepine, diazepam. Two groups of subjects were generated, a primparous group (pregnancy+21 days of lactation) and an age-matched, nulliparous group. All subjects were injected with diazepam (0.0, 0.5, 2.0 or 2.5 mg/kg) at least 6 weeks after primiparous females weaned their litters. Twenty minutes post-injection, subjects were place in an activity chamber and locomotor behavior was measured. Thirty minutes post-injection, subjects were tested on an automated elevated plus maze. In addition to behavioral testing, diazepam's effects on corticosterone levels were measured. Overall, diazepam's sedative effects on locomotor activity were significantly reduced in primiparous females when compared to nulliparous controls as determined both in the activity chamber and on the elevated plus maze. There was, however, no significant effect of reproductive experience on the anxiolytic effects of diazepam in the elevated plus maze. Finally, while diazepam increased corticosterone in both groups, primiparous females were less sensitive to the effects of the drug on corticosterone secretion. These results indicate that the effects of diazepam on locomotor activity and corticosterone secretion are attenuated following reproductive experience.", 
    "91": "The aim of the present study was to verify the consequences of telencephalic ablation on the learning of inhibitory avoidance and anxiety in goldfish. The animals were submitted to telencephalic ablation or sham operations five days prior to the experimental procedure. The inhibitory avoidance procedure was performed in 3 days using a rectangular aquarium divided into two compartments (black and white) with a central door. On the first day, the animals were habituated for 10 min. On the second and third days, they were injected with saline (SAL), 16 mg/kg Chlorpheniramine (CPA), 40% Propylene glycol (PPG) or 1 mg/kg Diazepam (DZP) twenty minutes before training. Then the animals were placed in the white compartment, the central door was opened and the time spent for crossing between compartments was recorded. After the fish crossed the line between the compartments a 45-g weight was dropped. This procedure was performed three times in a row. The groups submitted or not to telencephalic ablation and treated with SAL presented a difference between training sessions; however, the groups treated with CPA, PPG or DZP did not show any differences between them. These results suggest that the treatment with CPA, PPG or DZP impaired the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance conditioning in animals regardless of telecenphalic ablation. In conclusion, telencephalic ablation does not disrupt the animals' capacity to learn the inhibitory avoidance task, and based on the fact that CPA showed similar effects to those of DZP on the animals submitted or not to telencephalic ablation, we suggest that the CPA presents an anxiolytic-like effect mediated by the diencephalon in goldfish.", 
    "92": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant. It inhibits the anxiogenic activity of high doses of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and induces anxiolytic-like effects. However, the mechanisms underlying the actions of CBD are unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test the effects of CBD in the Vogel test, a widely used animal model of anxiety. In addition, it was verified if these effects would depend on benzodiazepine-receptor activation. After 24 h of water deprivation, male Wistar rats were subjected to an initial 3-min non-punished (pre-test) drinking session. This was followed by an additional 24-h period of water deprivation followed by a 3-min punished-licking session (test). Diazepam (3 mg/kg) or CBD (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected 30 min before the test session. CBD (10 mg/kg) and diazepam had similar anticonflict effects, increasing the number of punished licks. The effect of diazepam, but not of CBD, was prevented by the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg). To exclude that the anticonflict effects were reflecting non-specific drug effects, we checked the effects of CBD on water consumption and nociceptive response. The drug did not interfere on the former variable in a non-punished test session. Moreover, contrary to morphine (5 mg/kg), CBD was ineffective in the tail-flick test. In conclusion, CBD induced an anticonflict effect not mediated by benzodiazepine receptors or by non-specific drug interference on nociceptive threshold or water consumption. These results reinforce the hypothesis that this cannabinoid has anxiolytic properties.",

The initial dose was given until the Wilson sedation score reached 3, and an additional dose was given until the same score was obtained 40 min later. They were tested with perturbation stimuli 40, 80, 100, and 120 min after the additional doses had been given. Their recovery time was recorded. The mean (S.D.) initial dose of midazolam was 0.07 (0.005) mg kg(-1), and additional doses were 41 (7)% of the initial dose. The serial changes in bispectral index after initial and additional doses were similar. The recovery time for the dynamic balance test (within 80 min) was the same as that recorded in the previous single-dose study. The recovery time of the psychomotor function test was within 75 min. Additional doses of midazolam aiming for a Wilson sedation score of 3 at a dose about 40% of the initial dose and given 40 min after the initial dose are valid in terms of the maintenance of sedation and recovery of dynamic balance. Complete recovery time, including psychomotor function, was within 80 min of the additional dose of the drug.",

    "95": "Chronic insomnia affects a significant proportion of young adult and elderly populations. Treatment strategies should alleviate nighttime symptoms, the feeling of nonrestorative sleep, and impaired daytime function. Current pharmacological approaches focus primarily on GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRA) have been a mainstay of pharmacotherapy; the classical benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines share a similar mode of action and allosterically enhance inhibitory chloride currents through the GABA(A) receptor, a ligand-gated protein comprising 5 subunits pseudosymmetrically arranged around a core anion channel. Variations in GABA(A) receptor subunit composition confer unique pharmacological, biophysical, and electrophysiological properties on each receptor subtype. Classical benzodiazepines bind non-selectively to GABA(A) receptors containing a gamma2 subunit, whereas non-benzodiazepine hypnotics bind with higher relative affinity to alpha1-containing receptors. The non-benzodiazepine compounds generally represent an improvement over benzodiazepines as a result of improved binding selectivity and pharmacokinetic profiles. However, the enduring potential for amnestic effects, next day residual sedation, and abuse and physical dependence, particularly at higher doses, underscores the need for new treatment strategies. Novel pharmacotherapies in development act on systems believed to be specifically involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. The recently approved melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon, targets circadian mechanisms. Gaboxadol, an investigational treatment and a selective extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor agonist (SEGA), targets GABA(A) receptors containing a delta subunit, which are located outside the synaptic junctions of thalamic and cortical neurons thought to play an important regulatory role in the onset, maintenance, and depth of the sleep process.", 
    "96": "Understanding the consequences of newly discovered single gene mutations causing human epilepsy has the potential to yield new insights into the underlying mechanisms of this disorder. A mutation of the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, which substitutes glutamine for arginine at position 43 (R43Q) has been found in a familial generalized epilepsy. We tested the hypothesis that individuals affected by the GABRG2(R43Q) mutation have reduced binding to the GABA(A) receptor complex using positron emission tomography (PET) and the benzodiazepine receptor ligand [(11)C]-flumazenil. Fourteen subjects with the GABRG2(R43Q) mutation and 20 controls were studied. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was reduced in subjects with the mutation (mean whole brain binding potential for [(11)C]-flumazenil: GABA(A) mutation 0.66+/-0.1; controls 0.89+/-0.1; P<0.003). The greatest change in benzodiazepine binding occurred anteriorly, with peak differences in insular and anterior cingulate cortices revealed by statistical parametric mapping. Our findings provide in vivo evidence of reduced benzodiazepine receptor binding in subjects with the mutation. As synaptic inhibition in the human brain is largely mediated by the GABA(A) receptor, these findings are likely to represent an important clue to the mechanisms linking this gene defect and the epilepsy phenotype.",

    "106": "We report on a case of rhabdomyolysis induced by the correction of hyponatremia after psychogenic polydipsia and clozapine use, where the switch to a high dose of olanzapine resulted in the non-recurrence of rhabdomyolysis. The 46-year-old patient with the diagnosis of schizophrenia paranoid type, who had been on clozapine treatment for the previous 4 years, was admitted with the symptoms of generalized seizure and vomiting, and as severe hyponatremia was proved, its correction with the parallel use of clozapine treatment was done. CK concentrations increased to 48 120 U/L without any symptom of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. To prevent acute renal insufficiency, high-volume alkaline diuresis was initiated and clozapine was tapered and stopped. On the day 12 of treatment, olanzapine was started and was elevated to 30 mg/day. CK concentration began to fall returning to the normal concentration on day 20. Six months after the switch to olanzapine no recurrence of rhabdomyolysis was detected; clinical and laboratory findings were normal. We suggest that after a benzodiazepine-type antipychotic-induced rhabdomyolysis, a switch to another atypical antipsychotic can be a cautious clinical strategy.", 
    "107": "We report a case of generalized dermatitis and itch induced by a possible drug-food interaction in a young woman who was consuming clomipramine for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). A 33-year-old woman affected by anxiety symptoms presented to our observation for a clinical evaluation. After psychiatric evaluation, the diagnosis of OCD was performed according to DSM-IV-TR and a pharmacological treatment with clomipramine (75-100 mg/day) plus alprazolam (0.5 mg/day) was started. About one month later, the patient developed a severe generalized urticaria with intense itch. A new anamnesis revealed that on the day before the development of the skin rash, no other drug was consumed and the patient had eaten codfish; clomipramine was then gradually discontinued and changed into paroxetine (30 mg/day). At the moment the patient does not show any OCD related symptom and any adverse event to paroxetine treatment has been recorded. We postulate a possible interaction between clomipramine and codfish ingestion. Allergic potential of clomipramine was investigated, while clomipramine de-challenge induced a decrease of the skin rash, the drug re-challenge performed one month later did not induce any adverse event. In contrast, when the combined re-challenge of codfish and clomipramine was performed urticaria was newly observed. The Naranjo Probability Scale Score suggested a probable causal relationship between drug-food interaction and the skin rash. In conclusion, we suggest evaluating also the complete risk of drug-food interaction occurring on clomipramine treatment.", 
    "108": "Minto et al. (Anesthesiology 2000) described a mathematical approach based on response surface methods for characterizing drug-drug interactions between several intravenous anesthetic drugs. To extend this effort, the authors developed a flexible interaction model based on the general Hill dose-response relation that includes a set of parameters that can be statistically assessed for interaction significance.", 
    "109": "This new model was developed to identify pharmacologically meaningful interaction-related parameters and address mathematical limitations in previous models. The flexible interaction model and the model of Minto et al. were compared in their assessment of additivity using simulated sample data sets. The flexible interaction model was also compared with the Minto model in describing drug interactions using data from several other clinical studies of propofol, opioids, and benzodiazepines from Short et al. (Anesthesiology 2002) and Kern et al. (Anesthesiology 2004).", 
    "110": "The flexible interaction model was able to accurately classify an additive interaction based on the classic definition proposed by Loewe, with at most an 8% difference between the two surfaces. Also, the proposed model fit the clinical interaction data as well or slightly better than that of Minto et al.", 
    "111": "The new model can accurately classify additive and synergistic drug interactions. It also can classify antagonistic interactions with biologically rational surfaces. This has been a problem for other interaction models in the past. The statistically assessable interaction parameters provide a quantitative manner to assess the interaction significance.", 
    "112": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of diltiazem, a L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB), on the behavior of zolpidem-treated mice in the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Atypical benzodiazepine zolpidem significantly increased the percentage of open arm entries without influencing the total entries and total distance and average speed at the dose of 5 mg/kg (p.o.). Co-administration of zolpidem (2 mg/kg, p.o.) and diltiazem (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly increased both the time spent and arm entries in the open arms without influencing the total entries and spontaneous activity notwithstanding that zolpidem at dose up to 2 mg/kg (p.o.) and diltiazem at dose up to 20 mg/kg (p.o.) did not show any effects on mice behavior in EPM. Zolpidem also attenuated the anxiogenic effect of 1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP, 0.7 mg/kg, i.p.) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, 30 mg/kg, i.p.). Even though the zolpidem at 1 mg/kg and diltiazem at 5 mg/kg were ineffective on mCPP-induced anxiety, respectively, the co-administration of zolpidem (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and diltiazem (5 mg/kg, p.o.) showed inhibitory effect on mCPP-induced anxiety in mice. These results suggested that diltiazem, a L-type CCB may augment the anxiolytic-like effect of zolpidem and also indicated that calcium channel modulation maybe involved in the anxiolytic-like properties of zolpidem.", 
    "113": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are widely distributed in peripheral tissues, astrocytes, and microglia of the brain. They are involved in apoptosis, proliferation, and many other processes, such as steroidogenesis in adrenal glands, male and female gonads, biological adaptation to stress, etc. It has been established that the expression of PBR in astrocytomas is higher than in the normal brain. The goal of this study was to explore the correlation of the immunohistochemical expression of PBR in astrocytomas with the grade of malignancy and rates of apoptosis, proliferation and survival. In 130 cases of astrocytomas (25 grade I, 25 grade II, 20 grade III, 60 grade IV), paraffin sections were stained immunohistochemically for PBR and MIB-1(Ki-67). TUNEL assay was used for evaluation of apoptosis. It was found that the intensity and extent of staining for PBR had a strong direct correlation with the grade of malignancy of the tumor, along with proliferative and apoptotic indices. The highest expression of PBR was in glioblastomas grade IV, especially around areas of necrosis. There was a strong negative correlation between PBR expression and survival. The results of this study may be applied in the pathological diagnosis of astrocytomas as an additional clue in establishing tumor grade; they may be used in the imaging of astrocytomas, both for diagnosis and follow-up, by the application of positron emission tomography scanning with PBR specific ligands. Targeting of PBR in high-grade gliomas may be a promising approach, achieving more specific anti-tumor effect.", 
    "114": "Evidence from numerous neuropathological observations and in vivo clinical imaging studies suggests a prominent role of activated microglia, the main effector cell of the brain's innate immune system, in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Though the comprehensive molecular definition of the microglial activation process is still incomplete, the de novo expression of 'peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites (PBBS)' by activated but not resting microglia has been established as a useful descriptor of functional state changes in microglia. As microglial transformation to an activated state is closely linked to progressive changes in brain disease, the detection of activated microglia can provide information about disease distribution and rate of disease progression. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C](R)-PK11195, a specific ligand of the PBBS, have been used to study systematically microglial activation in vivo. Significant microglial activation is present in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative dementia even at early and possibly preclinical stages of the disease with a spatial distribution reflecting different clinical phenotypes. We review some of the posited functions of activated microglia in the pathophysiology of dementia and speculate on the relationship between increased regional [(11)C](R)-PK11195 signals and the ensuing changes in brain volume. Finally, we provide a brief outlook on the development of new radioligands for the PBBS.", 
    "115": "Midazolam is a drug that creates temporary anterograde amnesia. In a within-subjects, double-blind experiment, participants studied a list of stimuli after receiving an injection of midazolam in one session and after receiving saline in another session. The lists consisted of three types of stimuli: words, photographs, and abstract pictures. Recognition memory was tested at the end of each session. Memory was reliably poorer in the midazolam condition than the saline condition, but this amnesic effect was significantly smaller for pictorial stimuli than for words and almost nonexistent for abstract pictures. We argue that the less familiar the stimulus, the less likely it is to be associated with an experimental context. These data bolster our claim that unitization increases the chances of episodic binding and that drug-induced amnesia prevents episodic binding regardless of unitization.", 
    "116": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has been shown to be efficacious for treatment of psychotic and mood disorders in adults. This prospective, open-label study was conducted to examine the safety and usefulness of olanzapine in treating disruptive behavior disorders in adolescents with subaverage intelligence.", 
    "117": "Sixteen adolescents (ages 13-17 years) with borderline to moderate mental retardation and disruptive behavior were enrolled in an 8-week olanzapine trial (5-20 mg/day). Dependent measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Conners Parent Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impressions, and two side effects scales.", 
    "118": "Statistically significant improvement (p <.002) was found on the Irritability and Hyperactivity subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale Hyperactivity Index. No subjects developed extrapyramidal side effects. However, four were terminated prematurely from the trial because of either worsening of symptoms (requiring psychiatric inpatient hospitalization in two subjects) or side effects. The most common side effect for the sample was weight gain (averaging 12.7 lb), with 67% of subjects gaining > or =10 lb. Although there was also a statistically significant increase in prolactin levels, no subjects reported prolactin-related side effects (e.g., gynecomastia, galactorhea, amenorrhea).", 
    "119": "Olanzapine may be useful in treating disruptive behavior in adolescents with subaverage intelligence. However, side effects, especially weight gain, are a significant issue. Future double-blind, placebo-controlled studies need to confirm these findings and assess long-term safety and outcome of olanzapine treatment.", 
    "120": "Benzodiazepines are among the most commonly prescribed therapeutics. Women seem to be more likely than men to be prescribed a benzodiazepine and to use benzodiazepines for nonmedical reasons; they also appear to be at higher risk for benzodiazepine dependence. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the acute behavioral effects of a benzodiazepine in women and men. To accomplish this, 13 volunteers (6 women, 7 men) first learned to discriminate 0.375-mg triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic. After acquiring the discrimination, (i.e., >80% correct responding on 4 consecutive sessions) a range of doses of triazolam (0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375 mg) were tested in each participant. Triazolam dose dependently increased drug-appropriate responding and subject ratings of sedation and impaired performance (i.e., significant effect of dose). The women and men did not differ significantly on any measure. The results of the present experiment suggest that women and men are not differentially sensitive to the behavioral effects of triazolam.", 
    "121": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially serious complication of neuroleptic drugs. It may vary in both presenting characteristics and severity. Several different criteria for diagnosis exist, and each differs from the others slightly. We describe a 66-year-old woman with chronic paranoid schizophrenia who was prescribed olanzapine along with several other psychiatric drugs and an antihypertensive drug. The patient displayed several characteristics of NMS during therapy with olanzapine, including fever, elevated creatine kinase level, leukocytosis, and mild muscle rigidity. When olanzapine was held, the signs and symptoms improved and then returned with rechallenge of olanzapine. For this reason, olanzapine was considered strongly associated with this patient's apparent NMS episode. The patient's beta-blocker therapy may have masked additional signs of NMS. In addition, the patient tolerated other neuroleptics that were started in the hospital after the suspected NMS episode. The variation among different diagnostic criteria makes this syndrome a challenging diagnosis at times, in particular when atypical antipsychotics are suspected as the causative agent.", 
    "122": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic disease that may require lifetime treatment. The maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder can be challenging for the treating clinician. Currently, according to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines, lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and the antipsychotics are recommended for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. The antipsychotics are recommended to be continued only if the clinician decides that they are necessary for the control of persistent psychosis or for prophylaxis against recurrence. Although the APA guidelines provide sufficient evidence for the use of these mood stabilizers, newer drugs such as the atypical antipsychotics are being investigated for use in the maintenance phase of treatment of bipolar disorder.",

    "128": "Pharmacokinetic parameters of each protease inhibitor were evaluated to assess for a potential relationship with 4-hour concentrations of midazolam. No correlations between phenotype results for midazolam and any pharmacokinetic parameter for indinavir or saquinavir were identified (r(2)=0.00002-0.073). When the results were analyzed based on race, significant correlations were identified in five African-American subjects, including correlations between 4-hour midazolam levels and apparent oral clearance of saquinavir (r(2)=0.734, p=0.064), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-8 hours (r(2)=0.914, p=0.011), minimum concentration (r(2)=0.857, p=0.024), and maximum concentration (r(2)=0.969, p=0.002). These findings for African-American subjects were not seen with indinavir. No correlation was found between indinavir and saquinavir pharmacokinetic parameters (r(2)=0.017-0.261).", 
    "129": "Oral midazolam was not a useful probe for predicting saquinavir or indinavir exposure at steady state. Reasons for the lack of correlation likely included differences between midazolam and protease inhibitor P-glycoprotein specificity, differences in the relative contribution of CYP3A5-mediated metabolism, and/or variation in intestinal and hepatic CYP3A specificity. The strong correlation between midazolam phenotype and pharmacokinetic parameters for saquinavir in African-American subjects indicated a racial difference in one or more of these confounding variables.", 
    "130": "Absolute bioavailability studies in humans are not routinely performed as part of the drug registration process. They tend to be reasonably demanding, not least because toxicology data are required to support intravenous administration of a drug. Moreover, the classical crossover design of an absolute bioavailability study can suffer from artefacts caused by concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. Many of the problems associated with absolute bioavailability studies can be alleviated using isotopically labelled drugs. Stable isotopes have been used in the performance of absolute bioavailability studies in humans for > 30 years. More recently, the advantages of using radiolabelled drugs have been expanded by using the ultrasensitive technology of accelerator mass spectrometry. Isotopic labelling not only allows for the accurate and efficient determination of absolute bioavailability, but can also provide information on first-pass effects and other pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "131": "A current contribution in the European Journal of Health Economics employs a decision model to compare health care costs of olanzapine and risperidone treatment for schizophrenia. The model suggests that a treatment strategy of first-line olanzapine is cost-saving over a 1-year period, with additional clinical benefits in the form of avoided relapses in the long-term. From a clinical perspective this finding is indubitably relevant, but can physicians and policy makers believe it? The study is presented in a balanced way, assumptions are based on data extracted from clinical trials published in major psychiatric journals, and the theoretical underpinnings of the model are reasonable. Despite these positive aspects, we believe that the methodology used in this study-the decision model approach-is an unsuitable and potentially misleading tool for evaluating psychotropic drugs. In this commentary, taking the olanzapine vs. risperidone model as an example, arguments are provided to support this statement.", 
    "132": "Sleep disorders are not uncommon and have been widely reported throughout the world. They have a profound impact on industrialized 24-h societies. Consequences of these problems include impaired social and recreational activities, increased human errors, loss of productivity, and elevated risk of accidents. Conditions such as acute and chronic insomnia, sleep loss, excessive sleepiness, shift-work, jet lag, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea warrant public health attention, since residual sleepiness during the day may affect performance of daily activities such as driving a car. Benzodiazepine hypnotics and zopiclone promote sleep, both having residual effects the following day including sleepiness and reduced alertness. In contrast, the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zolpidem and zaleplon have no significant next-day residual effects when taken as recommended. Research on the effects of wakefulness-promoting drugs on driving ability is limited. Countermeasures for excessive daytime sleepiness have a limited effect. There is a need for a social awareness program to educate the public about the potential consequences of various sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea, shift-work-related sleep loss, and excessive daytime sleepiness in order to reduce the number of sleep-related traffic accidents.",

The first reported case of quetiapine and citalopram-associated serotonin syndrome is discussed with reference to a Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO literature search. The putative aetiological mechanism is supersensitivity of 5-HT(1A) receptors (quetiapine) within an environment of increased synaptic available serotonin (citalopram). The symptom profile of serotonin syndrome overlaps with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, but can be reliably differentiated using a time and toxicity scale.",

Compounds include forensically important drugs, such as illegal drugs, some deuterated analogues, hypnotics, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants and many others. For setting up the library of product ion spectra, 20-200 ng of the compounds have been injected either by flow injection or via a short LC-column, the precursor ions were chosen from the Q1 scan spectra, and product ion spectra were generated by CID in the collision cell using three different collision energies (20, 35 and 50 eV). Three spectra of each compound have been collected and compound names, CAS numbers, formulas and molecular weights have been added in the database, which has been generated by the Analyst software. The library can be used for compound identification during general unknown screening analysis by combination of Q1 scan techniques and subsequent MS/MS analysis in a second analytical run. Quantitative procedures for multi drug analysis using Multiple Reaction Monitoring can be established by selection of product ions and suitable collision energies from the library.

    "141": "It is now well accepted that besides its roles in motor control, the cerebellum is involved in non-motor functions with emotional aspects. Consistent with this view, several studies highlighted that the cerebellar Lurcher mutant mice (+/Lc), with motor impairments, also exhibited altered emotional reactivity, previously interpreted in term of behavioural disinhibition. In this study, we investigated the effects of a classical anxiolytic on such disinhibition. For that, behaviours of +/Lc and control (+/+) mice injected with NaCl or chlordiazepoxide (CDP 5 and 7.5mg/kg) were evaluated in the elevated plus-maze test. The motor impact of the drug (7.5mg/kg only) was also evaluated in the hole-board and unstable platform tests. Our results showed that, compared to the +/+ mice, CDP injection greatly influenced the anxious-related behaviours in the +/Lc mice by reducing their preference to the open areas in the elevated plus-maze test. Furthermore, we found that injection of CDP at the dose of 7.5mg/kg aggravated motor coordination deficit, altered motor learning capabilities in the mutants and provoked equilibrium disturbances in the non-mutant mice in the unstable platform test. These results indicated that CDP was able to reduce behavioural disinhibition in the cerebellar +/Lc mice and were discussed in term of implication of the cerebellar connections into CDP-sensitive neural circuitries involved in both emotional and motor processes.",

There is considerable evidence to support the effectiveness and durability of nonpharmacologic interventions for insomnia in adults of all ages, yet these interventions are underutilized. With some recent exceptions, the majority of identified studies of pharmacotherapy were of short duration (< or =6 weeks) and did not exclusively enroll older adults. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons.

Patients within 72 hours of acute myocardial infarction underwent screening with the Standardized Clinical Instrument for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition module for major depressive disorder (MDD), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). In addition, the study psychiatrist and a treatment team clinician independently assessed whether they believed that patients had clinically significant depression or anxiety. Prescription of antidepressants and benzodiazepines during hospitalization was recorded by chart review. Assessments were completed for 74 patients. Providers identified < 15% of patients with current MDD or with a BDI score > or = 10; 11% of patients with current MDD had appropriate treatment with antidepressants. There was no significant correlation of providers' assessment of depression with current MDD, BDI scores, or psychiatrists' clinical assessment of depression. In contrast, providers identified 31% of patients with a BAI score > or = 10 and 50% of patients who were assessed by psychiatrists as anxious; > 80% of patients with high anxiety received benzodiazepines. Providers' assessments of anxiety were significantly correlated with BAI scores and with psychiatrists' clinical assessments. In conclusion, medical residents and nurse practitioners routinely under-recognize and undertreat depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction on inpatient cardiac units. Recognition and treatment of anxiety is substantially better, up to 50% of patients who are found to be anxious by psychiatrists after acute myocardial infarction remain unrecognized.", 
    "153": "Compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) such as haloperidol, second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as olanzapine are found superior to improve cognitive performance and reduce negative symptoms with no extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). These clinical effects of SGAs have been reported to be associated with the most replicated phenomenon, favorable changes in brain regional blood flow and volume. The changes in brain regional blood flow are shown to parallel changes in angiogenesis, which is primarily mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through its receptor, Flk-1, on endothelial cells. Therefore, we studied the differential effects of time-dependent treatment (14 and 45 days) with haloperidol and olanzapine (2 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively, in drinking water) on hippocampal levels of VEGF, its receptor Flk-1, and angiogenesis in adult rat. The levels of VEGF were determined by both Western blot analysis and ELISA, and Flk-1 levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (RECA-1) and laminin were used to evaluate the changes in angiogenesis. After 14 days of treatment with both haloperidol and olanzapine, the levels of VEGF and angiogenesis were significantly increased (p<0.001 vs vehicle for both), but 45 days of treatment with haloperidol reduced their levels back to levels in vehicle-treated rats. However, olanzapine treatment further increased VEGF levels (p<0.05 vs levels after 14 days of treatment). Changes in the levels of Flk-1 paralleled the changes in VEGF levels. Thus, the data indicate that haloperidol and olanzapine have distinct time-dependent patterns of regulation of VEGF and angiogenesis. These changes probably provide a new molecular mechanism to better explain their differential effects on the patterns of regional blood flow and associated changes in regional volume/neuroplasticity and psychopathology.", 
    "154": "Naturally occurring polyphenols are potent antioxidants. Some of these compounds are also ligands for the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. This feature endows them with sedative properties. Here, the anxiolytic activity of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was investigated after acute administration in mice, using behavioral tests (elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance tests) and by electrophysiology on cultured hippocampal neurons. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that EGCG (1-10 muM) had no effect on GABA currents. However, EGCG reversed GABA(A) receptor negative modulator methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) inhibition on GABA currents in a concentration dependent manner. This was also observed at the level of synaptic GABA(A) receptors by recording spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission. In addition, EGCG consistently inhibited spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission. Behavioral tests indicated that EGCG exerted both anxiolytic and amnesic effects just like the benzodiazepine drug, chlordiazepoxide. Indeed, EGCG in a dose-dependent manner both increased the time spent in open arms of the plus-maze and decreased the step-down latency in the passive avoidance test. GABA(A) negative modulator beta-CCM antagonized EGCG-induced amnesia. Finally, state-dependent learning was observable after chlordiazepoxide and EGCG administration using a modified passive avoidance procedure. Optimal retention was observed only when animals were trained and tested in the same state (veh-veh or drug-drug) and significant retrieval alteration was observed in different states (veh-drug or drug-veh). Moreover, EGCG and chlordiazepoxide fully generalized in substitution studies, indicating that they induced indistinguishable chemical states for the brain. Therefore, our data support that EGCG can induce anxiolytic activity which could result from an interaction with GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "155": "Hepatocytes are epithelial cells that show a complex polarity in vivo. However, hepatocytes isolated and cultured in vitro normally lose both their differentiated properties and polarity. Culturing hepatocyte spheroids seems to be the accurate approach to maintain tissue level of organization. The structural and functionalpolarities of pig liver spheroids were analyzed in this work. Swine liver cells were isolated and cultured as spheroids. Their metabolic activity was proved through the metabolism of diazepam, ammonium and synthesis of albumin. Several structural features show the presence of polarity in the cells inside the spheroids. Reticular and collagen fibers, as well as Ck19(+) cells forming duct-like structures were found. _eta and _-catenins and pancadherins were positive in different regions of the spheroids, mainly in the outer cell layers, which have cuboidal epithelia features. The scanning electron microscopy showed a tightly compacted architecture, with smooth surface. The transmission electron microscopy analysis showed bile canaliculi with microvilli, tight junctions, zonula adherens and desmosome-like junctions. Well-maintained cellular organelles, as mitochondria, nucleus, nucleolus, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, were seen in the spheroids. A complex inner bile canaliculi network was shown by using a fluorescent bile acid analogue incorporated and excreted by the spheroids. Furthermore, excretion of a normal pattern of bile acids was demonstrated. The morphology and functionality of the spheroids may provide an appropriate model for applications where the maintenance of liver-specific functions is crucial, as a bioartificial liver device.",

Ninety three percent of the olanzapine patients (N=27 of 29) and 79.3% of the haloperidol patients (N=23 of 27) were clinically improved at endpoint. These differences were not statistically significant (p=0.25). The Simpson-Angus total score change from baseline to endpoint reflected no extrapyramidal symptoms among the olanzapine-treated patients (median=0.0, range=0.0). In contrast, worsening occurred among the haloperidol-treated patients (median=0.2, range=0.0-3.1). The differences of mean change in Simpson Angus Scale significantly favored olanzapine (p<0.01). Change to endpoint on the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed that olanzapine-treated patients' scores were close to the baseline (median=0.0, range=-1.0-0.0), whereas haloperidol-treated patients' scores worsened from the baseline (median=0.0, range=-1.0-3.0).

This study evaluated the acute effects of flunitrazepam (1.0 mg; 1.3 mg) and placebo in healthy volunteers on immediate and delayed free recall of word lists considering serial positions as well as semantic relations between words inserted in the middle of the lists (e.g. milk-cheese-butter). Flunitrazepam promoted a global amnestic effect, impairing recall in all serial positions except the last words (recency effect). Primacy and recency effects were preserved as indexed, respectively, by larger recall of the first and last words in relation to adjacent items. Facilitation in recall of semantically related words was not impaired by the drug when compared to recall in adjacent positions, in spite of a dose-dependent diminution of the number of words recalled also in mid-list positions. Flunitrazepam-induced deficits were interpreted as impairment in the formation of new associations between items, or groups of items in the case of related words, and context.",

The calculated number needed to treat for azapirones using the Clinical Global Impression scale was 4.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.16 to 15.4).

Results support the policy of gradual rather than abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepine. Progressive withdrawal (over 10 weeks) appeared preferable if compared to abrupt since the number of drop-outs was less important and the procedure judged more favourable by the participants. Short half-life benzodiazepine, associated with higher drop-out rates, did not have higher withdrawal symptoms scores. Switching from short half-life benzodiazepine to long half-life benzodiazepine before gradual taper withdrawal did not receive much support from this review. The role of propanolol in benzodiazepine withdrawal was unclear; adding tricyclic antidepressant (dothiepin) decreased the intensity of withdrawal symptoms but did not increase the rate of benzodiazepine abstinence at the end of the trial. Buspirone and Progesterone failed to suppress any benzodiazepine symptoms.

Pharmacological data suggests that the series of nonimidazole compounds can be used to describe the orthosteric binding site of the H4R because both 2 and 7j displace [3H]histamine in a competitive manner. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the effects of 7j are competitively antagonized by the selective H4R antagonist JNJ 7777120 (1), indicating considerable overlap of their binding sites. On the basis of the derived structure-activity relationships and additional pharmacological results, a pharmacophore model was constructed, which will be the premise for the design of novel H4R ligands."
