After single-step liquid-liquid extraction of plasma at pH 9.5 using chloroform-2-propanol-n-heptane (60:14:26, v/v), the substances are separated on a Nova-Pak C18 4-microns column (300 mm x 3.9 mm, I.D.), with methanol-tetrahydrofuran-pH 2.6 phosphate buffer (65:5:30, v/v) as the mobile phase (flow-rate 0.8 ml/min). Full ultraviolet spectra from 200 to 400 nm are recorded on-line during the entire analysis and may be automatically compared to spectra stored in a library. The retention times of the four drugs are 4.05 min (zopiclone), 4.66 min (zolpidem), 6.74 min (suriclone) and 10.97 min (alpidem). The analysis is performed in 15 min. The method is simple, rapid and highly specific. It is the first assay to be described for convenient screening of cyclopyrrolones and imidazopyridines.", 
    "1": "The binding of the bisquaternary muscarine receptor antagonist heptane-1,7-bis(dimethyl-3'-phthalimidopropyl)-ammonium bromide (C7/3-phth) was investigated at a number of cholinergic binding sites using (-)-[3H]nicotine, [3H]pirenzepine and (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) in both central and peripheral tissues. C7/3-phth displayed an affinity for muscarine M2 receptors in rat atria (70.1 nM) which was 1.6-fold greater than for putative M4 receptors in rabbit lung, and 4- to 5-fold greater than for M1 receptors in rat cerebral cortex. Its affinity for nicotine receptors in the cortex was low, being 808-fold lower than its affinity for the M2 receptor. Although the displacement of (-)-[3H]nicotine and [3H]pirenzepine binding in rat cortex by C7/3-phth was best described in terms of one-site modelling, low Hill coefficients were observed with C7/3-phth in displacement studies using [3H]QNB in this tissue. The possibility of allosteric interactions or multiple receptor subtype interactions is discussed.", 
    "2": "We have investigated the possible modifications of the pharmacological properties of Type I and Type II benzodiazepine binding sites of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex in cortical membranes from 3- and 24-month-old Wistar or Fischer rats. No major changes were found in the binding parameters of [3H]zolpidem (a Type I-specific ligand) or [3H]flunitrazepam (a non-selective benzodiazepine). Neither the Kd values nor the Bmax for either ligand were modified during aging in cortical membranes from Wistar or Fischer rats. Consequently, the proportion of Type I binding sites was also unmodified in aged cortical membranes. The absence of modifications of Type I and Type II binding sites was also confirmed by Cl 218,872 displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in aged cortical membranes from Wistar rats. Furthermore, the [3H]muscimol binding and the allosteric interactions between Type I or total benzodiazepine binding sites and GABA binding sites also remained unaltered with aging in cortical membranes from Wistar rats. Moreover, the pattern and proportion of the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled peptides were also unmodified by aging. These results demonstrate the absence of modifications in Type I or total benzodiazepine binding sites of the GABAA receptor complex from adult and aged cortical membranes in Fischer or Wistar rats.", 
    "3": "Data on 674 patients, admitted between 1986 and 1990 to a medical intensive care unit with acute poisoning (8.8% of total admissions), were analysed retrospectively. Females slightly predominated (53.4%); the age distribution peaked in the third decade of life. Attempted suicide made up 68.7 of all cases (64.8% in females), while 30% of intoxications were accidental (70.8% in males). Alcohol was the most common form of poison (41.4%), followed by benzodiazepines (27%) and psychoactive drugs (24.5%), more than one drug having been taken in 36.1% of cases. Artificial ventilation was needed in 14.2% of cases, while resuscitation was necessary in 1.6%. Forms of detoxication were: gastric lavage (58%), forced diuresis (6.4%), haemoperfusion (10.1%), haemodialysis (3.4%). An anticholinergic syndrome developed in 8% of cases, pneumonia in 3%, acute renal failure in 1.2%. Rhabdomyolysis occurred in 2.5%. The death rate was 1.2%.", 
    "4": "In the present study, we investigated the ability of NMDA receptor antagonists to inhibit catalepsy induced by haloperidol, or SCH23390 and clebopride, selective dopamine D1 and D2 receptor antagonists respectively. Catalepsy was measured by recording the time the animal remained with its forepaws placed over a rod 6 cm above the bench. Pretreatment with either the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.25-0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or the competitive antagonist, LY274614 (10-20 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the cataleptic response produced by haloperidol (10 mg/kg), SCH23390 (2.5-10 mg/kp i.p.) or clebopride (5-20 mg/kg i.p.). This demonstrates that NMDA receptor antagonists will reduce both dopamine D1 and D2 receptor antagonist-induced catalepsy. Muscle relaxant doses of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.) failed to reduce the catalepsy induced by haloperidol, suggesting that the anticataleptic effect of the NMDA receptor antagonists was not due to a non-specific action. These results support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor antagonists may have beneficial effects in disorders involving reduced dopaminergic function, such as Parkinson's disease.", 
    "5": "The effects of a low (0.001 mg/kg) and a high (0.1 mg/kg) dose of the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of zacopride were investigated in the elevated plus-maze in control-treated and diazepam-withdrawn rats. The rats withdrawn from diazepam were tested 36 h after the last of 28 days of treatment (2 mg/kg per day). The rats withdrawn from diazepam had a significant anxiogenic response, shown by decreases in the percentage of open arm entries and the percentage of time spent on the open arms. The low dose of S(-)-zacopride and both doses of R(+)-zacopride significantly reversed this anxiogenic response. In contrast, in the control-treated rats there were no significant effects on any measure of either isomer at doses of 0.001, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg.", 
    "6": "The effect of galanin (GAL) on the basal and the muscarinic agonist/antagonist mediated release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the striatum was investigated in male rats using in vivo microdialysis and HPLC techniques. GAL (300 microM or 3 nmol/10 microliters), perfused through the microdialysis membrane into the striatum, was found to enhance basal ACh release. The GAL evoked ACh release was completely prevented by bupivacaine, a sodium channel blocker (1.5 mM) when coperfused with GAL. This suggests that the effect of GAL depends on intact neuronal activity and thus derives from impulse-dependent release. The muscarinic agonists oxotremorine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) or carbachol (100 microM, infusion) reduced ACh release and reduced the stimulation of ACh release by GAL with a magnitude corresponding to that of oxotremorine or carbachol alone. Thus, the resultant effect of GAL on ACh release remained unchanged. When GAL was given at a threshold dose (30 microM), which by itself did not stimulate ACh release, it was unable to attenuate the muscarinic agonist induced inhibition of ACh releases. Furthermore, GAL given in combination with scopolamine (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) or pirenzepine (1 microM, infusion) added to the stimulating effect by the two muscarinic antagonists. In contrast to the GAL (300 microM) evoked ACh release, the scopolamine (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) stimulated ACh release was not blocked by M15, a putative GAL antagonist, indicating that the mechanisms behind GAL and scopolamine evoked striatal ACh release differ. These results suggest that the mechanisms behind GAL evoked release do not involve direct interactions with pre- or postsynaptic muscarinic receptor mediated events. It is concluded that the stimulation of the basal ACh release by GAL in the striatum occurs via occupation of GAL receptors located on cholinergic interneurons and that the release process is dependent on intact neuronal activity.", 
    "7": "In the course of examining the actions of the cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) on pancreatic acini we found that CCK-8 can stimulate release of the large-molecular-weight cytoplasmic protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by as much as 6-fold. CCK-8-stimulated LDH release is mediated by a CCK-preferring receptor, detectable at 100 pM CCK-8, maximal at 100 nM CCK-8, constant for up to 30 min, reversible, not desensitized, and dependent on oxidative metabolism and incubation temperature but not on calcium in the extracellular medium. This action of CCK-8 is blocked by inhibitors of protein kinases, staurosporine, H-7, H-8 and H-9, but not by calmodulin antagonists, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine or W-7. This action of CCK-8 on LDH release is not reproduced by TPA, 8Br-cAMP or A23187. Thus, it appears to be mediated by a previously uncharacterized protein kinase or an isoform of protein kinase C that is not maximally stimulated by TPA.", 
    "8": "A direct densitometric method for determination of diazepam and its metabolites in urine was developed. The proposed procedure involves acid hydrolysis of urine specimens, thereby converting diazepam and its metabolites into benzophenones [2-methylamino-5-chlorobenzophenone (MACB) and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone (ACB)]. It is followed by extraction with chloroform-isopropanol (3:1, v/v). The two benzophenones were separated on thin-layer chromatography plates using hexane-diethyl ether-acetic acid (80:10:10) as a mobile phase. Quantitation of the MACB and ACB spots was achieved by direct ultraviolet densitometry. The limit of detection was 0.5 micrograms per ml of urine for both benzophenones. The proposed method is simple, rapid, reproducible and has been found to be effective for direct determination of diazepam and its metabolites in urine.", 
    "9": "The effects of ritanserin on spontaneous benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal-induced weight loss, anorexia and hypodipsia were studied. Groups of female rats initially received i.p. injections b.i.d. (11.00 and 17.00h) of either saline or chlordiazepoxide (CDP). CDP doses increased by 2mg/kg/day from 10mg/kg to a final does of 30mg/kg. Treatment was maintained for 26 days. Over the next 6 days animals were either treated b.i.d. with vehicle, CDP, or ritanserin at one of three doses (0.16,0.63 and 2.5mg/kg). In CDP-pretreated animals subsequently treated with vehicle, significant weight loss, anorexia and hypodipsia were seen, relative to controls. In saline-pretreated animals ritanserin had no effect on body weight. However, CDP withdrawal-induced weight loss was actually exacerbated by ritanserin, in a dose-related fashion. Thus, ritanserin potentiated withdrawal-induced weight loss, by a process which did not involve functional (additive) effects of withdrawal and ritanserin treatment. Ritanserin stimulated food intake in saline-pretreated animals. Despite this effect it failed to alleviate CDP withdrawal-induced anorexia. However, in contrast to the weight loss index, no evidence was obtained for potentiation of withdrawal-induced anorexia. In saline-pretreated animals ritanserin had no effect on water intake, nor did it alleviate or potentiate CDP withdrawal-hypodipsia. Thus the effects of ritanserin on somatic BZ withdrawal signs depended upon the specific sign studied, different signs showing potentiation or no effect. However, for none of the signs studied was there any evidence that ritanserin alleviated the effect of CDP withdrawal. 5-HT(2/1C) antagonists may therefore be of limited value in the treatment of somatic aspects of the BZ withdrawal syndrome. They may even exacerbate some BZ withdrawal signs, although a full characterization of the effects of such drugs on BZ withdrawal requires that a number of other different withdrawal signs and symptoms should be studied, since it seems likely that different BZ withdrawal signs involve different underlying mechanisms.", 
    "10": "This study compared behavioral and subjective effects of two anxiolytics, the benzodiazepine lorazepam and the azaspirodecanedione buspirone, in healthy male volunteers with histories of sedative drug abuse. Placebo, lorazepam (1, 2, 4, 8mg/70kg) and buspirone (15, 30, 60, 120mg/70kg) were administered p.o. in a mixed sequence in a double-blind, cross-over design. Lorazepam, but not buspirone, decreased psychomotor/cognitive performance. Both drugs produced similar increases in ratings of drug strength, however the onset and offset times for lorazepam were later than for buspirone. Lorazepam increased ratings of liking in contrast to buspirone which produced negative mood-related subjective effects (e.g. increases in ratings of disliking, bad/unpleasant effects, and tension-anxiety). Lorazepam was categorized by subjects as producing effects similar to barbiturates or benzodiazepines in contrast to buspirone which was not. When subjects were given a choice between self-administering an intermediate dose of lorazepam (4mg/70kg) or buspirone (60mg/70kg), which produced similar ratings of drug strength, eight out of nine subjects chose lorazepam. This study provides the clearest human experimental evidence to date that the abuse liability of buspirone is lower than that of a prototypic benzodiazepine, even at supratherapeutic doses.", 
    "11": "Continuous infusion of intravenous anesthetics can be achieved either by a manually controlled infusion (MCI) pump, or by a computer-assisted continuous infusion (CACI) pharmacokinetic model-driven infusion system. Randomized double-blind comparisons of the two infusion systems for general anesthesia were performed in 24 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients were allocated to receive continuous infusions of midazolam and fentanyl by either a MCI device or CACI. Midazolam and fentanyl infusions were independently titrated to maintain hemodynamic stability, defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) within 20% of baseline values. As directed by the study design, comparable hemodynamic control was achieved in both groups. Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations measured at specific timepoints were similar between groups. The plasma midazolam level for induction was 196 +/- 139 ng/mL in the CACI group and 300 +/- 128 ng/mL in the MCI group, and the fentanyl level was similar in both groups, 6.7 +/- 1.9 ng/mL in CACI and 6.3 +/- 4.6 ng/mL in the MCI group. The drug levels were lower (P < or = .05) for midazolam during maintenance of anesthesia and similar for fentanyl during the maintenance of anesthesia. In the MCI group, the average duration of anesthesia was 246.5 +/- 35.0 minutes, with a mean total fentanyl dose of 30.27 +/- 11.14 micrograms/kg. In the CACI group, the average duration of anesthesia was 230.8 +/- 44.1 minutes, with a mean total fentanyl dose of 34.61 +/- 5.40 micrograms/kg (P > 0.05 for comparisons between groups for duration of anesthesia and total fentanyl dose).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Alprazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine that is extensively prescribed in the Western world for the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders. Its benzodiazepine receptor binding characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of other benzodiazepines. The drug is metabolised primarily by hepatic microsomal oxidation, yielding alpha-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam as principal initial metabolites. Both have lower intrinsic benzodiazepine receptor affinity than alprazolam and appear in human plasma at less than 10% of the concentrations of the parent drug. Plasma concentrations of the 4-hydroxy metabolite exceed those of the alpha-hydroxy derivative, but urinary recovery of alpha-hydroxy-alprazolam greatly exceeds that of 4-hydroxy-alprazolam. This may be explained by chemical instability of 4-hydroxy-alprazolam in vitro. After single 1 mg oral doses in humans, typical pharmacokinetic variables for alprazolam are: a peak plasma concentration 12 to 22 micrograms/L occurring 0.7 to 1.8h postdose, a volume of distribution of 0.8 to 1.3 L/kg, elimination half-life of 9 to 16h and clearance of 0.7 to 1.5 ml/min/kg. Absolute bioavailability of oral alprazolam averages 80 to 100%. Pharmacokinetics are dose-independent and are unchanged during multiple-dose treatment. On average, mean steady-state plasma alprazolam concentrations change by 10 to 12 micrograms/L for each daily dosage change of 1 mg/day. Most studies show that alprazolam pharmacokinetics are not significantly influenced by gender. Clearance of alprazolam is reduced in many elderly individuals, even those who are apparently healthy. Clearance is significantly reduced in patients with cirrhosis. Renal disease causes reduced plasma protein binding of alprazolam (increased free fraction) and some data suggest reduced free clearance of alprazolam in such patients. Pharmacokinetics of alprazolam are not significantly altered in abstinent alcoholics or patients with panic disorder, and are not influenced by the phase of the menstrual cycle in women. Coadministration of cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine or propoxyphene significantly impairs alprazolam clearance. However, alprazolam clearance is not altered by coadministration of propranolol, metronidazole, disulfiram, oral contraceptives or ethanol. Imipramine clearance may be impaired if alprazolam is coadministered. Alprazolam does not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Although a therapeutic concentration range is not clearly established, some studies indicate that optimal reduction of anxiety associated with panic disorder occurs at steady-state plasma alprazolam concentrations of 20 to 40 micrograms/L. Concentrations higher than this may be needed for suppression of the actual panic attacks. Side effects associated with alprazolam (drowsiness, sedation, etc.) are consistent with its primary benzodiazepine agonist action and increase in frequency with higher steady-state plasma concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The DEXFENT combination blunted the increases in blood pressure and heart rate induced by tracheal intubation more efficiently when compared with the DEXPLA and MIDFENT groups, in which approximately 25 mmHg and 15 beats/min greater increases were observed. The intraoperative fentanyl requirements were greater in MIDFENT patients when compared with both dexmedetomidine groups, in which 56% (DEXFENT group) and 31% (DEXPLA group) less fentanyl, respectively, was needed. Intraoperatively, fluids or vasopressors for hypotension and glycopyrrolate for bradycardia were administered more often to patients receiving dexmedetomidine than to those who did not. Postoperatively, there were no differences in oxygen saturation, analgesic, or antiemetic requirements, but dexmedetomidine-induced blood pressure and heart rate reductions were still evident at the end of the 3-h follow-up period. Bradycardia as an adverse event was reported more frequently in dexmedetomidine patients (20% in the DEXPLA and 33% in the DEXFENT groups) than in MIDFENT patients (8%).",

    "17": "Pharmacokinetic theory dictates that the extent of ensuing metabolism of a formed metabolite during drug transit through the liver is influenced by the number of consecutive reactions required for its genesis and the total intrinsic clearances of the precursors. This hypothesis was tested in the perfused murine liver by examining the successive conversion of the precursor diazepam (DZ) to its primary metabolite nordiazepam (NZ), and then the secondary metabolite oxazepam (OZ) and, finally, the tertiary metabolite, the oxazepam glucuronides. The concomitant C3-hydroxylation of DZ to temazepam, which can also be N-demethylated to form OZ, was minimal. The hepatic extraction ratios of NZ (E[NZ,DZ]) and OZ (E[OX,DZ]) after administration of [14C]DZ were compared to those obtained previously from [14C]NZ (E[NZ] and E[OZ,NZ]) and [3H]OZ (E[OZ]). The ability of three hepatic clearance models, the well-stirred, parallel-tube and dispersion models, to predict the experimental E[NZ,DZ] and E[OZ,DZ] was evaluated. DZ was highly extracted by the murine liver (E[DZ] = 0.95). The metabolism of NZ, generated in situ from DZ, was greater than that of preformed NZ (E[NZ,DZ] = 0.51; E[NZ] = 0.4), whereas E[OZ,DZ] (0.066) was similar to E[OZ,DZ] (0.056) and less than E[OZ] (0.0125). The unexpected observation of E[NZ,DZ] > E[NZ] may be explained by the coupling of N-demethylation and C3-hydroxylation/glucuronidation reactions or by a sequestration of hydrophobic substrates within the enzymic space, favoring sequential metabolism of products formed in situ. The atypical kinetic behavior of generated NZ may have also influenced the ensuing metabolic fate of its product, OZ, such that E[OZ,NZ] approximately E[OZ,DZ].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "In murine liver, temazepam (TZ) and nordiazepam (NZ) are mainly metabolized via N-demethylation and C3-hydroxylation, respectively, to form a common metabolite, oxazepam (OZ), which is then glucuronidated. With these precursors, we tested the hypotheses that the sequential metabolism of a primary metabolite (OZ) is less than that of the preformed metabolite and is dependent on the effective intrinsic clearance (unbound fraction x intrinsic clearance) of its precursor, as predicted by the parallel tube and dispersion models of hepatic drug clearances. Mouse livers were perfused with tracer concentrations of [14C]-NZ, [14C]-TZ and [3H]NZ in a single-pass fashion (2.5 ml/min). The steady-state extraction ratio (E) of [3H]NZ, [14C]NZ and [14C]TZ were 0.29, 0.40 and 0.49, respectively (P < .01), whereas the fractional metabolism (formation rate/total elimination rate of drug) of [3H]-NZ, [14C]NZ and [14C]TZ to form OZ was 0.39, 0.79 and 0.68, respectively. Values of E of [3H]NZ and [14C]NZ and fractional metabolism for OZ formation had differed because of a kinetic isotope effect (around 3.5) that affected the C3-hydroxylation of [3H]NZ. The extraction ratios of OZ (E[OZ,P]) arising from [14C]-NZ and [14C]TZ were both 0.056, and were less than that for preformed OZ (E[OZ]), previously found to be 0.125.

    "19": "L-365,260, a nonpeptide antagonist of gastrin/CCK-B receptors, was evaluated in receptor binding, antisecretory and gastrointestinal damage assays. L-365,260 binds potently and stereo-selectively to gastrin and CCK-B sites in guinea pig tissue. In contrast, L-365,260 binds to the isolated canine parietal cell gastrin receptor weakly, and without stereoselectivity. In the pylorus-ligated rat, low doses of L-365,260, given i.v., attenuated pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion, whereas higher doses were required to inhibit both histamine-stimulated and basal acid secretion. In an aspirin-induced gastric damage model, L-365,260 was 2.4-fold less potent than the standard histamine H2 antagonist cimetidine in preventing gastric damage when given i.v., and was 8.3-fold less potent than cimetidine when given p.o. Moreover, the ED50 value for L-365,260, given i.v., in prevention of aspirin-induced gastric damage (11.5 mg/kg) agreed well with its ED50 value for inhibition of basal acid secretion (12.6 mg/kg). At doses as great as 100 mg/kg p.o., neither L-365,260 nor cimetidine had an effect on ethanol-induced gastric damage. L-365,260, although p.o. less bioavailable relative to cimetidine in the aspirin gastric damage model, was as potent as cimetidine in the prevention of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers in the rat. We conclude that the gastrin/CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260, at doses supramaximal for the inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated secretory responses in vivo, inhibits gastrointestinal damage in models of peptic ulcer disease by an antisecretory mechanism of action.", 
    "20": "The effects of i.v. administered flumazenil (3.0 mg) were studied in healthy male subjects who received pretreatment with p.o. placebo or lorazepam. The duration of placebo or lorazepam (3.0 mg single p.o. daily dose) pretreatment before a flumazenil or placebo injection was 1, 3, 7 or 14 days in four sequential groups of subjects. Initial administration of lorazepam produced a classic sedative profile of effects on various psychomotor/behavioral performance, observer-rated and subject-rated measures. Tolerance to repeated daily administration of lorazepam was suggested by a progressive diminution of performance disrupting effects. In subjects pretreated with placebo, flumazenil increased subject-ratings of dizziness over preinjection ratings. Flumazenil produced an immediate reversal of lorazepam effects in subjects who were not tolerant to lorazepam (1- and 3-day pretreatment groups). Flumazenil did not precipitate withdrawal symptoms in subjects who received a single administration of lorazepam. Precipitated withdrawal symptoms were evident after 3 and 7 days of lorazepam pretreatment, and there was a tendency toward precipitated withdrawal symptoms (that included one panic attack) after 14 days of lorazepam pretreatment. Precipitated withdrawal was characterized by an elevation in subject-rated symptoms including dizziness, tenseness, tachycardia, perceptual disturbance and sweating. Symptoms were maximal immediately after injection, usually mild in severity and usually resolved within 1 hr. There was no evidence of precipitated withdrawal on psychomotor/behavioral performance or observer ratings. The present study provides the strongest human experimental evidence to date that flumazenil can precipitate withdrawal symptoms after a history of repeated benzodiazepine exposure.",

After 5 to 6 weeks of stabilization, the intensity of precipitated abstinence was measured by benzodiazepine-precipitated abstinence scores (BPAS) after the p.o. administration of graded doses of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (0.66, 2, 6, 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg or a placebo). A modified Latin square design was used. Dogs receiving the two lowest stabilization doses of diazepam showed only liminal signs of precipitated abstinence even with 72 mg/kg of flumazenil. The intensity of the precipitated abstinence syndrome increased with the stabilization dose of diazepam. There was also a dose-related increase in BPAS for increasing doses of flumazenil for all doses of diazepam except the 9-mg/kg/day dose. Not only were quantitative differences observed in precipitated abstinence signs for different levels of diazepam dependence, but the pattern of abstinence signs differed also. Dogs dependent on high doses of diazepam were more sensitive to flumazenil than those dependent on lower doses. Furthermore, seizure activity was seen only in dogs dependent on 9 and 36 mg/kg/day of diazepam. BPAS increased linearly with plasma and brain total and free levels of the sum of diazepam and its metabolites (oxazepam and nordiazepam), but not with free plasma and brain levels of diazepam.", 
    "22": "A novel method for the assessment of the threshold for clonic seizures induced by excitatory amino acids based on continuous infusion of the glutamate agonists [alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-terbutyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (ATPA), kainate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)] into the lateral brain ventricle of unrestrained mice is reported. Using this novel method of seizure threshold determination, it was found that systemically administered diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine elevated the threshold for ATPA and had negligible effects on the threshold for kainate and NMDA. Phenobarbital and trimethadione elevated the threshold for all excitatory amino acids tested, whereas valproate elevated the threshold for ATPA and kainate seizures. Ethosuximide elevated the threshold for ATPA and kainate and decreased the threshold for NMDA seizures. The quisqualate antagonists [2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine] elevated the threshold for ATPA and less so for kainate seizures, whereas the NMDA antagonist 3-((+-)2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonate elevated the threshold for NMDA seizures. 1-(4-Aminophenyl)4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine in higher doses was also active against NMDA seizures, whereas 3-((+-)2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonate did so with kainate seizures.

The focus localising ability of the two PET tracers was examined using extra--and intracranial EEG recordings as reference. The focus was first determined visually on the PET images obtained after a bolus injection of each of the PET tracers. Its anatomical localisation and spatial delimitation was then evaluated for each patient with a computerised anatomical brain atlas. [11C]flumazenil was found to be a more sensitive and accurate focus localiser than [18F]FDG. This observation was valid both for quantified and non-quantified images. In the preoperative diagnosis of epileptic foci, the PET measurements of BZ receptors may be a suitable and, in some cases, superior method to the generally used \"[18F]FDG-PET\" method.", 
    "24": "This study evaluates midazolam's immediate pharmacological impact on esophageal motility. Stationary esophageal motility in normal male volunteers was evaluated to obtain a baseline study. Immediately after the baseline study, each subject received midazolam 0.02 micrograms/kg intravenously, and underwent repeat manometry 5 min later. Midazolam produced a variety of motility changes. There was a decrease in upper esophageal sphincter resting pressures (p < 0.05). Median pressures increased in the esophageal body at 3 cm below the upper esophageal sphincter (p < 0.05). Lower esophageal sphincter residual pressure increased, and the percentage of relaxation decreased (p < 0.05). The most striking change was the induction of tracings consistent with nonspecific esophageal motility disorders (p < 0.01). On the basis of these results, we conclude that esophageal motility testing should not follow procedures in which midazolam is used, until the duration of its effects on the esophagus is known.",

    "33": "One approach to elucidating the general anesthetic target has used genetic selection procedures, wherein animals are bred for sensitivity or resistance to general anesthetics and correlations are sought with a specific neuronal structural or functional defect. For example, murine strains have been developed that are either sensitive or resistant to the obtunding effects of diazepam, as assessed by their ability to maintain balance on a rotating rod. The present study explored whether diazepam-sensitive (DS) and diazepam-resistant (DR) mice might also be similarly divergent in the obtunding response to general anesthetics, by testing the requirements for halothane and enflurane in these strains. Using a carousel enclosed in a chamber, the end-point of loss-of-righting reflex was defined. For both anesthetics, the DS groups had a lower median effective dose (ED50, %atm) than did the DR group, and the reductions paralleled diazepam susceptibility. For example, with halothane, the ED50 for the DS group was 0.72 +/- 0.022 (SE); the ED50 for the DR group was 0.87 +/- 0.030 (P < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained with enflurane. Such findings associate an inbred difference in response to diazepam with altered volatile anesthetic requirement, suggesting that these two phenotypes are mediated by a common underlying mechanism.", 
    "34": "The present study was initiated to examine the effects of ATP on acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. The exposure of superior cervical ganglia to ATP increased ACh stores by 25%, but this effect was also evident with ADP, AMP, and adenosine, but not with beta gamma-methylene ATP, a nonhdydrolyzable analogue of ATP, or with inosine, the deaminated product of adenosine. Thus, we attribute the enhanced ACh content caused by ATP to the presence of adenosine derived from its hydrolysis by 5'-nucleotidase. The adenosine-induced increase of tissue ACh was not the consequence of an adenosine-induced decrease of ACh release. The extra ACh remained in the tissue for more than 15 min after the removal of adenosine, but it was not apparent when ganglia were exposed to adenosine in a Ca(2+)-free medium. Incorporation of radiolabelled choline into [3H]ACh was also enhanced in the presence of adenosine, suggesting an extracellular source of precursor. Moreover, the synthesis of radiolabelled forms of phosphorylcholine and phospholipid was not reduced in adenosine's presence, suggesting that the extra ACh was not likely derived from choline destined for phospholipid synthesis. Aminophylline did not prevent the adenosine effect to increase ACh content; this effect was blocked by dipyridamole, but not by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI). In addition, two benzodiazepine stereoisomers known to inhibit stereoselectively the NBTI-resistant nucleoside transporter displayed a similar stereoselective ability to block the effect of adenosine. Together, these results argue that adenosine is transported through an NBTI-resistant nucleoside transporter to exert an effect on ACh synthesis. The extra ACh accumulated as a result of adenosine's action was releasable during subsequent preganglionic nerve stimulation, but not in the presence of vesamicol, a vesicular ACh transporter inhibitor. We conclude that the mobilization of ACh is enhanced as a result of adenosine pretreatment.", 
    "35": "Thoracic epidural block may unpredictably blunt the physiological sympathetic response to anaesthetic agents and profound hypotension could result at induction time. The authors evaluate two different induction regimens in 16 patients scheduled for major thoracic surgery in order to assess which of them would produce less hemodynamic changes. After the institution of high thoracic epidural block (6 ml lidocaine-CO2 2% + epinephrine 1/200,000 level: th.2-3), patients were randomly allocated in two induction groups: P and M. Group P received 2 mg/kg of propofol over 30 seconds; group M received midazolam 0.2 mg/kg plus alfentanil 30 mcg/kg. In Both groups induction was followed by a significant drop in blood pressure (-18% in group M and -37% i group P. In P group the fall in blood pressure is more pronounced than M group (p < 0.05). Noteworthy in both groups cardiac frequency do not increase and in M group significantly lowers. In the authors view the midazolam plus alfentanil induction technique compare well with propofol alone and would recommend its use in poor risk patients.", 
    "36": "Midazolam was used for prolonged sedation in ten adult patients with severe tetanus in the Intensive Care Unit for periods ranging from 10 to 50 days. An infusion was started soon after induction and adjusted according to clinical needs. All the patients were intubated and ventilated and in addition received morphine 1-2 mg/hr and alcuronium or pancuronium infusion. Two patients died from complications of tetanus. Six patients recovered from the effects of midazolam within 24 hrs of the cessation of infusion. Recovery took 48 and 72 hrs respectively in the other two patients. Midazolam is a suitable drug for long-term sedation in patients with tetanus. However, dose requirements are variable and recovery may be delayed in some patients.", 
    "37": "Ketamine (K) is a good analgesic and anesthetic agent in short procedures, but the associated cardiovascular responses and emergence reactions limit its use. Benzodiazepines have been used to improve recovery with favourable reports for midazolam (M). Methylphenidate (MPH), the mild CNS stimulant, improves behaviour and mental concentration and can be used to improve recovery from K anesthesia. This was tested, alone and in combination with M by a double-blind study in 30 patients subjected to short transurethral urologic procedures. Patients were randomized into 3 equal groups to receive K-MPH, K-M or K-M-MPH. M (7.5 mg) was mixed with K and MPH (20 mg) was given at the end of urologic procedures. Perioperative monitoring included pulse rate, blood pressure, ECG, and plasma catecholamines. Recovery was assessed by a triad VAS and recovery area was calculated. Distribution-free statistics were used to assess intergroup differences of similar variables. Ketamine produced satisfactory anesthesia for short transurethral urologic procedures. Addition of M did not change the cardiovascular responses of K but resulted in smooth recovery with no changes in the recovery scores. MPH did not improve the recovery scores but increased the incidence of vomiting, excessive talking, and limb movements.", 
    "38": "The anticonvulsant effects of propofol administered intravenously against picrotoxin-induced seizure were studied and compared with those of diazepam and thiopental in the rat using picrotoxin-seizure threshold. Comparable doses of the three agents ranging between 1.25-20.0 mg/kg, produced dose-dependent increases in picrotoxin-threshold dose. At the lowest administered dose (1.25 mg/kg), there were no significant differences in picrotoxin-threshold dose among the three agents. Using 2.5 mg/kg dose, propofol and diazepam were equally effective and both were significantly more effective than thiopental in increasing picrotoxin-threshold dose. At higher doses of anticonvulsants (10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg), propofol was significantly more effective than both diazepam and thiopental. These results indicate that propofol is an effective anticonvulsant against picrotoxin-induced seizure, and this effect is significantly greater than diazepam and thiopental at doses producing clear sedative and behavioral effects.",

One hundred and five patients divided into three groups of 35 patients each, received buprenorphine (0.3 mg), diazepam (10 mg) and normal saline (0.5 ml) respectively along with atropine (0.6 mg) in each case. The study emphasizes that sympathetic explanation of the details of the procedure to the patients, administration of careful topical anaesthesia and avoidance of sedation makes the procedure acceptable, safe, comfortable with less complications and the need for admitting the patients to the ward is by and large avoided.",

    "41": "The effects of atropine, diazepam and pralidoxime were studied for their ability to block the pathological lesions induced by sarin. Rats were exposed to an aerosol of sarin at a concentration of 51.2mg.m-3 for 15 min following the pretreatment with one of the following combinations: atropine (10 mg/kg, i.m.) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.m.); atropine and pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, i.m.); diazepam and pralidoxime; atropine, diazepam and pralidoxime. Lung exposed to sarin aerosols revealed an increased cellular proliferation with progressive diffused interstitial thickening on the 4th day following exposure. On the 16th day, loss of alveolar space and consolidation of large areas of all lobes were observed. Sarin also caused damage to the respiratory bronchioles. All the therapy regime blocked the development of lung lesions in the descending orders: atropine, diazepam and pralidoxime, atropine and diazepam > diazepam and pralidoxime > atropine and pralidoxime. The result suggests that diazepam in combination with atropine and pralidoxime could be an effective drug combination regime for the lung lesions.",

A high density of [3H]-PK 11195 binding sites was present in gerbil cortical membranes (Bmax [3H]-PK 11195 1360 +/- 71 fmol mg-1 protein) in comparison to rat cortical membranes (254 +/- 21 fmol mg-1 protein). This effect was species-specific as similar findings were obtained with hippocampal membranes (Bmax 1430 +/- 111 fmol mg-1 protein in gerbil, compared to 196 +/- 31 in rat). 2. RO 5-4864, also a peripheral type benzodiazepine compound, displayed low affinity for the [3H]-PK 11195 site in the gerbil (pKi 6.57 +/- 0.02 and 6.70 +/- 0.12 in hippocampus and cortex respectively) compared to rat (pKi 8.16 +/- 0.07 and 8.48 +/- 0.02). Central benzodiazepine compounds, diazepam and flunitrazepam, also displayed this trend. 3. RO 5-4864 displaced [3H]-PK 11195 binding from gerbil and rat cortical membranes through a competitive interaction with Hill slopes close to unity. In both tissues, saturation isotherms of [3H]-PK 11195 binding indicated that the presence of RO 5-4864 caused changes in Kd without any effect on Bmax. In kinetic experiments, the presence of RO 5-4864 failed to modify the rate of dissociation of [3H]-PK 11195 from equilibrium in both rat and gerbil cortical membranes. 4. Forebrain ischaemia in the Mongolian gerbil (5 min bilateral carotid artery occlusion) with 7 days recovery caused a significant (P<0.05) decrease in the density of hippocampal 5-HTlA binding sites labelled by [3H]-8-OH-DPAT (Bmax control, 393 +/- 33 fmol mg-1 protein; ischaemic, 289 +/- 21 fmol mg protein)and an increase (P<0.01) in [3H]-PK 11195 binding sites (Bmax control, 1430 +/- 111 fmol mg-1 protein; ischaemic, 2160 +/- 170 fmol mg-1 protein). Ischaemia and recovery had no effect on the affinity of either ligand.5. Autoradiography experiments in gerbil brain sections revealed that the ischaemia-induced increase in[3H]-PK 11195 binding was consistent and significant in the CA, subfield on the hippocampus (control,152 +/- 42 fmol mg-1 tissue; ischaemic, 314 +/- 43 fmol mg-1 tissue).", 
    "43": "Extracellular and intracellular recordings have been made from the somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats. From 264 neurons having receptive fields including the contralateral whiskers, we have determined that two distinct patterns of firing are observed, and call these two patterns regular spiking and bursting. Iontophoretically administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscimol, or flurazepam showed significantly weaker inhibition of the bursting pattern of firing than of the regular spiking pattern. By contrast, baclofen inhibited both types of firing to the same extent. These results suggest that intracortical GABA receptor subtypes are involved in different ways in modulating the expression modes of discharge.", 
    "44": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) may interact in the pathogenesis of AIDS. We compared CMV replication in human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells to that in HOS cells genetically engineered to contain an envelope-deficient HIV-1 proviral construct (designated HOS-HXG). Following acute CMV infection of each cell line, HOS-HXG cells contained higher numbers of intranuclear CMV nucleocapsids than did HOS cells. Infectious CMV could be persistently detected in culture supernatant fluids of the CMV-infected HOS-HXG cells, whereas CMV was lost over several weeks from HOS cells infected with CMV in parallel. HIV-1 CMV pseudotypes were not detected in supernatant fluids from CMV-infected HOS-HXG cells. On day 119 after CMV infection, these cultures were superinfected with HIV-1. These dually infected HOS-HXG cells produced infectious HIV-1 and exhibited markedly enhanced CMV replication compared to parental CMV-infected HOS-HXG cells. Two different HIV-1 tat gene function antagonists, Ro24-7429 and chemically modified antibodies to the Tat protein, did not inhibit the replication of CMV in either acute or persistent infections of HOS-HXG cells at concentrations that inhibited HIV-1 replication.", 
    "45": "Double tracer autoradiography was performed to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the binding of central type benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) in infarction by means of permanent occlusion of the unilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCA) in rat. Iodine-125 Iomazenil and 99mTc-HMPAO was used to label BZR and rCBF respectively. In the chronic phase of infarction 21 to 28 days after occlusion (5 rats), rCBF in the left MCA territory was decreased to 62% of the sham control (4 rats), while BZR was more decreased to 45% of the control. In remote areas from the MCA lesion, the ipsilateral thalamus showed 28% decrease of BZR as compared to the control, though the decrease of rCBF was not significant. Iomazenil distribution may represent neuron density or BZR density on a neuron, since central type BZR is reported to be located on neurons. These results suggest that central type BZR imaging is more useful tool for the evaluation of brain tissue viability and transneuronal degeneration than rCBF imaging in brain infarction.", 
    "46": "Rats on a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) regimen showed a persistent reduction in seizure threshold to the convulsant drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). CIE rats were given ethanol by intubation on an alternate day schedule and tested at selected intervals for seizure threshold with PTZ. A significant reduction in seizure threshold, a sign of withdrawal, was observed 20 hr after the first dose. The severity of withdrawal intensified on repetition of the ethanol administration and depression-hyperexcitability cycle, with the seizure threshold reaching a maximum decrease after 12 doses and remaining reduced up to 60 doses. The reduction in seizure threshold persisted for at least 40 days of no alcohol following the 60th dose. The long-lasting decrease in seizure threshold following CIE treatment resembled the \"kindling\" phenomenon produced by chronic administration of PTZ (25 mg/kg, 3 times/week). The CIE rats developed, in addition, a tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of ethanol, which occurred well after the decrease in PTZ seizure threshold, and a tolerance to the hypothermic effect of ethanol, which developed rapidly. PTZ kindled rats that had never been exposed to ethanol also exhibited tolerance to the hypothermic effect of ethanol. We propose that kindling contributes to the mechanism of the development of dependence on central nervous system depressants like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol, drugs that act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor chloride ion channel complex. Repeated episodes of depression and withdrawal hyperexcitability are postulated to produce kindling during the repeated withdrawal episodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "The ability of flurazepam to antagonize the electrical precipitation of tonic hindlimb extension is reduced 24 h after mice are forced to swim for 10 min in cold water (6 degrees C). Presumably, this reduction in flurazepam's antiseizure efficacy reflects an environmental stress-induced modification of the GABAA receptor complex. The current study employed a variety of complementary in vitro approaches to characterize the delayed effects of cold-water swim stress on binding parameters of the GABAA receptor complex that may be associated with flurazepam's reduced antiseizure efficacy. The specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and the potentiation of this binding by chloride ions did not change after stress in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Moreover, swim stress did not alter the ability of GABA to inhibit the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), a ligand that is a specific biochemical marker of the GABA-associated chloride ionophore, to crude membranes prepared from the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Swim stress was associated with alterations of the specific binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to crude hippocampal and cerebellar membranes. The results are considered in the context of new insights derived from molecular cloning studies of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "48": "cDNAs encoding human alpha 2 and alpha 3 gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor subunits have been cloned. Their deduced amino acid sequences show much sequence identity with the published bovine sequences (98.2% and 97.0% for alpha 2 and alpha 3, respectively). Human alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2, and alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2 subunit combinations were expressed in transiently transfected cells and their pharmacologies were characterized using a series of benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site ligands. Human alpha 1-containing receptors exhibited a BZ1-type pharmacology, and alpha 2-, alpha 3-, and alpha 5-containing receptors exhibited a broadly BZ2-type pharmacology. The partial inverse agonist Ro15-4513 showed an approximately 10-15-fold higher affinity for alpha 5-containing than for alpha 1-, alpha 2-, or alpha 3-containing receptors and is thus the first compound shown to have a significantly higher affinity for another receptor subtype than for alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2.", 
    "49": "The binding characteristics of [3H]diazepam and [3H]alprazolam were obtained by in vitro analysis of sections of rat brain. Dissociation, association, and saturation analyses were performed to optimize the conditions for obtaining selective labeling of benzodiazepine receptors with the two tritiated compounds. Both drugs approached equilibrium rapidly in vitro. Rosenthal analysis (Scatchard plot) of the saturation data indicated a similar finite number of receptors was being occupied by both ligands. Competition studies, using various ligands to inhibit both [3H]diazepam and [3H]alprazolam indicated that these two compounds bind to the tissue sections as typical benzodiazepine drugs and apparently do not overlap onto other subtypes of receptors. These experiments were performed by both binding assay in tissue sections and by light microscopic autoradiography. The major difference between the labeling of the two compounds is represented by the peripheral benzodiazepine sites, which are recognized by [3H]diazepam, but not occupied by [3H]alprazolam (at nanomolar concentrations). This difference was readily apparent in the autoradiograms. Other pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties must distinguish these two benzodiazepines.", 
    "50": "Pharmacologically relevant concentrations of inhalational anesthetics such as halothane, enflurane and isoflurane enhance [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) binding to benzodiazepine receptors prepared from well-washed membranes of murine cerebral cortex and cerebellum. These effects were concentration dependent and markedly enhanced by addition of chloride to the incubation medium. Using halothane as a prototype inhalational agent, it was observed that like barbiturates, increases in [3H]FLU binding were effected through an increase apparent in the apparent affinity of this radioligand with no accompanying change in the maximum number of binding sites. Although previous reports have demonstrated barbiturates augment gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhanced [3H]benzodiazepine binding, halothane exerts an additive effect in the nominal absence of chloride. Isoflurane produces a significant reduction in the EC50 of pentobarbital-augmented [3H]FLU binding. Halothane modestly reduced the binding of a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, [3H]Ro 15-4513. Significant differences were also observed in the potencies and efficacies of both isoflurane and enflurane to enhance [3H]FLU binding to benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellar and cortical membranes. These findings provide a possible molecular basis for the clinical observation that benzodiazepines and barbiturates augment the anesthetic properties of inhalational agents. Moreover, the regional differences in anesthetic potency and efficacy reported here suggest a differential interaction of these inhalational agents among gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor isoforms.", 
    "51": "2'-Iododiazepam (2'-IDZ) is the diazepam analogue iodinated at the 2'-position of C-5 phenyl ring which was synthesized and evaluated as a potential radiopharmaceutical for investigating brain benzodiazepine receptors by SPECT. The 125I-2'-iododiazepam was synthesized by halogen exchange reaction and purified by HPLC. In vitro competitive binding studies with 3H-diazepam, using rat cortical synaptosomal membranes, showed that the affinity of 2'-IDZ for benzodiazepam receptors was higher than that in diazepam and flumazenil (RO15-1788). Biodistribution studies in mice showed that the brain uptake of 2'-iododiazepam was rapid and profound, and in the brain higher accumulation was found in the cortex than in other regions. Furthermore, the cortical uptake was displaced by benzodiazepinergic compounds. In vivo uptake was assessed by autoradiographic studies. Thus, 2'-iododiazepam bound to benzodiazepine receptors in vivo and therefore holds great potential for in vivo benzodiazepine receptor studies.", 
    "52": "Mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBR) are sensitive to anxiety and stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether platelet MBR are altered in untreated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and whether chronic treatment with clomipramine (CMI) regulates these receptors. MBR were assessed in 13 drug-free OCD patients as compared with 15 healthy controls. Seven of the 13 patients were treated with CMI (200-300 mg/day). The density and affinity of the receptors to their ligand [3H]PK 11195 in OCD patients and controls were not affected by the CMI treatment despite the clinical improvement. It seems that, in contrast to generalized anxiety disorder, OCD is not associated with alterations in platelet benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "53": "Recent studies have reported that patients with unipolar major depression may show a lower whole brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reduced regional CBF in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. The present study used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the CBF marker Tc-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxine (HMPAO) to measure the cortical CBF of six individual regions of interest (ROIs), total ROI, and left or right hemispheric total ROI in 43 unipolar depressed subjects and 12 normal control subjects. There were no significant differences in the distribution of Tc-99m-HMPAO uptake into total ROI, right or left global ROI, prefrontal, motor frontal, parietal, temporal, visual cortex, or associative visual cortex between patients with melancholic depression, simple major depression, or minor depression and healthy control subjects. There were also no significant differences in the right-left distribution of uptake between the patients and the control subjects. Hypoperfusion was observed in motor frontal and parietal cortex of patients who had been taking benzodiazepines during the study period. It is concluded that cortical CBF, as assessed with Tc-99m-HMPAO SPECT, is relatively intact in the present sample of patients with severe depression.", 
    "54": "We describe a fast, automated system for the measurement of righting reflex latencies in drug studies. This system, which we call a 'tolerometer', is especially useful for studies of drug tolerance which require a simple measurement of motor behaviour on a daily basis, for long periods of time. The tolerometer consists of a semi-cylindrical platform positioned on a 2 kg load cell, connected to a strain gauge amplifier (Radio Spares Ltd). The output from the amplifier is connected to a MacLab data acquisition system (Analog Digital Instruments), controlled by a Macintosh Classic computer. The MacLab Chart program is used to display, on the Macintosh screen, the load changes which occur during a righting reflex; sampling frequencies up to 40 kHz can be used, but we find 20-100 Hz adequate. Using measurement cursors provided by the Chart program, the latency from the point at which an animal is placed on the tolerometer platform in the supine position, until the completion of a righting reflex, can be measured accurately and easily.",

The effect of the CCKA receptor antagonist, devazepide (100 mg kg-1) on meal parameters during the initial phase of the dark period was studied in free-feeding rats by use of a procedure for continuously monitoring feeding patterns. 2. In a second experiment, the effect of devazepide on the reduction in meal parameters induced by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) releaser and uptake inhibitor, (+)-fenfluramine (1.5 mg kg-1) in 4 h food-deprived rats was examined. 3. The hypophagic effect of an intraperitoneal injection of cholecystokinin (CCK-8, 4 micrograms kg-1) was studied in rats treated with the 5-HT receptor antagonist, metergoline (1 and 2 mg kg-1). 4. Devazepide increased the size of the first meal in free-feeding, but not in 4 h food-deprived rats and partially antagonized the effect of (+)-fenfluramine on the size and duration of the first meal. The reduction in eating rate induced by (+)-fenfluramine was not modified by devazepide. No changes in (+)-fenfluramine or (+)-norfenfluramine levels were found in the brain of rats treated with devazepide. 5. The effect of CCK-8 on meal size was completely antagonized by 2 mg kg-1 metergoline. A significant interaction was also found between 2 mg kg-1 metergoline and CCK-8 as regards their effect on the inter-meal interval. 6. The results suggest a reciprocal interaction between 5-HT and CCK-8 in enhancing the satiating effect of food in rats.", 
    "58": "1. Binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, [3H]-PK 11195, to rat hippocampal membranes has been used to quantify the reactive gliosis resulting from neuronal death induced by intraperitoneally administered kainic acid. 2. Intraperitoneal administration of kainic acid (10 mg kg-1) caused a 350-500% increase in [3H]-PK 11195 binding measured in rat hippocampal P2 membranes 7 days later. Co-treatment with the adenosine derivative R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) (100, 25 or 10 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) abolished this elevation. The protective action of R-PIA could itself be abolished by co-treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline (1 mg kg-1). 3. Body temperatures were recorded in the antagonist experiments and no significant changes were recorded, suggesting that the protective action of R-PIA was not mediated by hypothermia. 4. Since systemic kainic acid-induced neurotoxicity has been claimed as a good model of neuronal death in temporal lobe epilepsy, the results suggest that the systemic administration of purines in low doses may provide protection against certain neurodegenerative insults.",

Best results were obtained with single stones smaller than 20 mm. After ESWL, surgical cholecystectomy was necessary in 2.1% of cases. This study confirms the efficacy and safety of piezoelectric extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy combined with ursodeoxycholic acid adjuvant therapy for selected cases of gallstone disease.", 
    "60": "The evaluation of a commercially available valerian root extract (Valdispert) revealed pronounced sedative properties in the mouse with respect to a reduction in motility and an increase in the thiopental sleeping-time. A direct comparison with diazepam and chlorpromazine revealed a moderate sedative activity for the tested extract. The extract showed only weak anticonvulsive properties.", 
    "61": "Effects of the GABAergic drug diazepam (0.15 mg kg-1, i.v.) on cardiovascular and endocrine responses to 50 degrees head-up tilt were evaluated in seven men. During the initial phase of tilt (normotensive phase), increases in heart rate (HR) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) and decreases in cardiac output were unaffected by diazepam. Also the associated increase in plasma noradrenaline did not change, while response in plasma ACTH was diminished and in plasma cortisol abolished by diazepam (F(1,10) = 6.45; P < 0.03). After 42 +/- 4 min of sustained tilt with saline (control) and 47 +/- 6 min (n.s.) after diazepam, presyncopal symptoms appeared (hypotensive phase) associated with decreases in HR, MAP, and TPR (P < 0.01). This episode induced a 2-3-fold increase in plasma ACTH, beta-endorphin, prolactin, cortisol (< 0.01), and a moderate increase in plasma adrenaline (P < 0.05). Diazepam did not significantly change cardiovascular and endocrine responses to the hypotensive phase of tilt. Results indicate that diazepam attenuates the cortisol part of pituitary-adrenal responses to moderate, but not to severe, central hypovolaemia in humans with no effect on cardiovascular tolerance.", 
    "62": "Approximately 10 to 30% of patients with schizophrenia show poor response to neuroleptics alone. An initial evaluative and treatment approach to these patients is outlined, and the literature on adjunctive treatments, which seek to augment neuroleptic effects, is reviewed. The greatest evidence for efficacy has been shown for lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, reserpine, and electroconvulsive therapy, although individual patients may also respond to propranolol, clonidine, valproic acid, and L-dopa. Antidepressants may also be useful for treating comorbid depression in nonacutely psychotic patients. One general theme is that no one adjunctive treatment benefits all patients; indeed, only a minority of patients responds to any given agent. Therefore, the choice of specific treatments is best guided by the clinical characteristics of the individual patient. These observations raise the possibility that subgroups of schizophrenia exist; delineation of differences in clinical response to biochemically distinct agents may help elucidate such underlying differences between patient groups.", 
    "63": "A randomized, double-blind controlled trial is reported comparing phenobarbital and clonazepam for the purpose of sedative-hypnotic taper in inpatients with chronic, nonmalignant pain. After receiving the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and a standardized psychiatric diagnostic interview, patients' baseline sedative-hypnotic use was assessed over 48 hours. Baseline use was converted into phenobarbital or clonazepam equivalents and administered in four doses daily using a blinded liquid pain cocktail. Baseline dose was maintained for two days and then tapered by 10% per day. Over the first week of taper, differences in mean and maximum Beck Anxiety and Benzodiazepine Withdrawal scores were not significant. However, when scales 1, 3, or 8 of the MMPI were taken as covariates, differences on the Withdrawal Scale only increased to a trend level for mean scores and to a significant level for maximum scores. These findings support the superiority of benzodiazepines over barbiturates for sedative-hypnotic taper for symptoms of withdrawal but not of recurrent or rebound anxiety.", 
    "64": "A case of intraoperative recall and awareness in a patient with sickle cell disease who had received midazolam, 10 mg at induction of anesthesia, is reported. The patient was on opioids which may also have caused tolerance. Although the use of midazolam may have been judged to provide adequate amnesia, this was clearly not the case. Upon analysis of the reasons for recall, we predicted from a two-compartment model that the estimated blood level was 88 ng/mL-1; this level would have provided no amnesia. This case illustrates that recall can occur with the use of midazolam, especially if levels become subtherapeutic, and other measures should be taken to provide adequate anesthesia and amnesia.", 
    "65": "Behavior of rats in the water-lick conflict test was examined during stimulation, and after lesions of the lateral septal nucleus. Continuous low-current stimulation resulted in an anxiolytic effect, an increase in the number of licks, and hence in the number of shocks, during a signaled, punished period. This effect is similar to the one seen with peripheral administration of benzodiazepine and other anxiolytic agents. Rewarding medial forebrain stimulation did not have this effect. Conversely, septal lesions resulted in an anxiogenic effect, a significant decrease in the number of licks during the punished period. Lesions had this effect when the conflict behavior was already well established. Septal lesions performed before acquisition of the conflict behavior resulted in initial retardation of acquisition. The results suggest an important role for the lateral septum in the inhibition of anxiety and in the acquisition of behaviors reinforced by alleviation of anxiety.", 
    "66": "Thermospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometric method is described for the determination of the benzodiazepines (Nitrazepam, Estazolam, Bromazepam, Flunitrazepam). Reversed-phase liquid chromatography was performed using a 15 cm Shim-pack CLC-ODS (Shimadzu) column, with acetonitrile-water (40:60) + 0.1 M ammonium acetate as mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The temperature of the vaporizer, block and TH of the source block were 166, 270 and 275 degrees C, respectively. Positive ion thermospray mass spectra by thermospray ionization (TSP ionization) mode or thermospray on filament ionization (filament-on ionization) mode were obtained. Formation of the MH+ ion was observed as a base peak under TSP ionization and filament-on ionization conditions and fragment ions were very few. On both ionization mode, peaks representing nitrazepam as MH+ at m/z 282 at a retention time (R.T.) of 6.4 min, from estazolam as MH+ at m/z 295 at an R.T. of 6.4 min, from bromazepam as MH+ at m/z 316 at an R.T. of 4.5 min and from flunitrazepam as MH+ at m/z 314 at an R.T. of 8.8 min.

    "68": "Sedation may be used in intensive care and emergency medicine to improve the oxygen demand/delivery ratio. The influence of sedation has most frequently been investigated in a dose-related manner. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect-related influence of different sedatives on oxygen uptake (VO2) in relation to defined resting conditions. METHODS. Forty ASA I patients who had to undergo a minor surgical procedure were investigated 1.5 h before surgery at basal energy-expenditure measurement conditions. One of the following substances was given with a preset bolus rate in a double-blind, randomised order until a defined level of sleep or side effects was encountered: propofol (n = 8), midazolam (n = 8), thiopentone (n = 8), sodium chloride (n = 8), and fentanyl (n = 8). The sleep level was defined as sluggish response to a loud voice or tapping on the forearm. The variables VO2, carbon dioxide elimination (VCO2), end tidal CO2 (p(et)CO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate, systemic blood pressure, skin temperature, and skin resistance on the sole of the foot were documented on-line on a computer. All variables were compared using differences of averages from 10-min periods before and after sedation during which the VO2 was minimal. RESULTS. The mean VO2 before sedation was 264 +/- 60 ml/min, and the measured energy expenditure did differ by -0.2% (+/- 14%) from mean predicted values using the Harris-Benedict equation. The VO2 was reduced by 15 +/- 2% with propofol, by 12 +/- 8% with midazolam, and by 10 +/- 5% with thiopentone. This was statistically significant compared to placebo treatment, as was the difference between propofol and thiopentone effects. All patients in these groups reached the defined sleep level, which was not achieved by the placebo and fentanyl groups. Placebo treatment changed the VO2 by 0.1% (+/- 2%). Fentanyl increased the VO2 by 5% (+/- 8%), which did not reach significance. In the fentanyl group the bolus application had to be stopped at a p(et)CO2 of 50 mm Hg in all patients. In the propofol, midazolam, and thiopentone groups the phasic changes of skin resistance were reduced to zero and the skin temperature increased from 27 +/- 2 degrees C to 32 +/- 2 degrees C. The fentanyl group showed an increase in changes of skin resistance without changes in temperature. CONCLUSIONS. Sleep induced by propofol, midazolam, or thiopentone to a clinically maximal desirable level in spontaneously breathing patients reduced VO2 by 10% to 15%. This level of sedation did not induce a relevant change in P(et)CO2 or SaO2. The effect of propofol appeared to be the most pronounced and least variable. This may be attributable to a more pronounced reduction in single-organ VO2 or to an undetected difference in level of sedation. Fentanyl did, in contrast to most publications on opioid effects, seem to increase VO2. Underlying mechanisms may be sought in an increased rate-pressure product and sympathetic activity on the basis of hypercapnia and changes in muscle tension.", 
    "69": "Sleep problems and nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hence, the safety and efficacy of new hypnotic agents must be ascertained in this group of patients. We performed a double-blind, randomized, single-dose, placebo and active drug controlled, crossover study in 24 patients with insomnia (subjective sleep latency > 30 minutes and sleep duration 4-6 hours) and mild to moderate COPD (mean FEV1 61 +/- 12(SD)% predicted) in order to establish the effects of zolpidem 5 mg and 10 mg on sleep and respiration and to compare these effects with triazolam 0.25 mg. Arterial oxygen saturation for the entire night, by hour and stage, and the apnea-hypopnea index for the entire night were not significantly different with placebo and the various drug conditions. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were increased over placebo by all three drug conditions. Triazolam was more effective than zolpidem 5 mg but not zolpidem 10 mg, and there was no significant difference between zolpidem 5 mg and zolpidem 10 mg. Zolpidem 10 mg and triazolam both reduced the number of awakenings (> 15 seconds duration) per hour of sleep. Although there was a trend for triazolam to be more efficacious than zolpidem 10 mg, no statistically significant difference was found for any objective or subjective sleep variable. Likewise, zolpidem 10 mg tended to be more efficacious than zolpidem 5 mg, but the difference was only significant in terms of perceived sleep quality and ease of falling asleep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Each of the four treatments were administered for 2 days at 0900 hours with blood samples drawn on day one at 0830, 1030, 1230, 1430 and 1630 hours, and sleep latency and performance assessed on day two at 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1600 hours. Significant sedative effects of ethanol, triazolam and diphenhydramine relative to placebo were observed on the sleep latency and performance measures with the effects being detected over the full 6.5 hours of assessment. Among the active drugs, triazolam and diphenhydramine had similar sedative effects which differed from that of ethanol. Plasma concentration of each drug declined significantly over the 6.5 hours. Ethanol reached zero, but triazolam and diphenhydramine did not. Continued sedation (sedative effects after plasma concentration reached zero) was observed with ethanol.", 
    "71": "The interactions of chlorpromazine, clomipramine, maprotiline and viloxazine hydrochlorides, and of clorazepate dipotassium salt and diazepam with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and Stedim 6 infusion bags were studied. Stedim 6, is anew multilayer film whose inner layer is made of polyethylene. The drugs were in 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride isotonic solutions and the influence of these was also considered. The remaining concentrations of each drug were determined at regular time intervals in a 24-h period, by a spectrofluorometric method for chlorpromazine hydrochloride and by ultraviolet spectrophotometric methods for the other drugs. No binding was observed for viloxazine and maprotiline hydrochlorides whatever the infusion solution and the plastic container. A slight retention in PVC bags, but not in Stedim 6 ones, was noted for clomipramine hydrochloride and clorazepate dipotassium salt. This was more marked in the sodium chloride solution than in the dextrose one. Diazepam and chlorpromazine hydrochloride were bound both in PVC and Stedim 6 bags, but more in the former and more again in the sodium chloride solution than in the dextrose one. The results were explained in terms of the degree of crystallinity of the plastic material and the degree of lipophilicity of the drugs. Practical consequences are discussed.", 
    "72": "We studied physiological and pharmacological maturation of cholinergic innervation to tracheal smooth muscle in piglets at three ages: < 7 days, 2-3 wk, and 10 wk. Change in tracheal tension was measured in vivo from a tracheal segment and normalized for its size. Electrical vagal stimulation induced a significantly weaker increase in tracheal tension at < 7 days when compared with 2-3 and 10 wk. In vivo studies employing vagal stimulation before and after topical application of pirenzepine (an M1 muscarinic receptor blocker) and in vitro pharmacological studies evaluating the inhibition of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding by pirenzepine demonstrated that immature M1-receptor function could not account for the weak tracheal smooth muscle responses in the first week. Topical application of the cholinergic agonist methacholine to the tracheal segment also induced a significantly weaker contractile response at < 7 days when compared with 2-3 and 10 wk. Total density of muscarinic receptors, as well as the M1 and M3 muscarinic subtypes, was not statistically different among < 7-day-old, 1- to 3-wk-old, and adult animals. Receptor binding studies in 1-3 wk and adult animals demonstrated biphasic dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]QNB binding in tracheal smooth muscle membranes by methacholine, with a high-affinity component dependent on the availability of G protein. These high-affinity muscarinic receptors coupled to G protein were absent in < 7-day-old piglets. We speculate that the weak tracheal smooth muscle contraction observed during the first week of life is in part secondary to immature G protein function.", 
    "73": "Biological approaches to the patient with treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive disorder are briefly reviewed. The most commonly employed strategy involves combining a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) (e.g., clomipramine or fluvoxamine) with another medication that may exert effects on the brain serotonin system. Open-label reports regarding the addition of tryptophan, fenfluramine, lithium, or buspirone to ongoing SRI therapy of obsessive compulsive disorder are encouraging. However, the anti-obsessive compulsive efficacy of SRI-lithium and SRI-buspirone combination therapy has not been confirmed in recent controlled trials. Preliminary evidence suggests that addition of neuroleptic may benefit SRI-refractory obsessive compulsive disorder patients who have a comorbid chronic tic disorder. Other biological approaches (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery) are considered in terms of their narrowly defined roles in the treatment of patients with SRI-resistant obsessive compulsive disorder. Finally, an algorithm is proposed for those patients with obsessive compulsive disorder who fail to respond to an adequate trial with a potent SRI.",

    "75": "A 2025-g, 33-weeks' gestation infant was born with respiratory distress syndrome that required mechanical ventilation. Lorazepam was used to establish sedation and prevent asynchronous breathing while the infant was on the ventilator. Shortly after the first dose of lorazepam, the infant experienced a seizure and was subsequently given a loading dose of phenobarbital. Lorazepam therapy was continued for sedation. The patient was transferred to our tertiary care center on day 2 of life for evaluation of possible cardiac disease. Upon arrival, the infant was extremely hypotonic and unresponsive; therefore, all sedative medications were discontinued. Two days after admission, the infant continued to exhibit very little spontaneous activity and a lorazepam serum concentration was obtained (63 h after the last dose). Analysis revealed a toxic lorazepam serum concentration of 4453 nmol/L. The patient eventually was weaned to room air and was transported back to the referring hospital.",

Its metabolism depends on glucuronidation, an enzymatic process that is very depressed in the premature infant. Accumulation of the drug in the neonate accompanied by clinical toxicity is highly likely.",

    "86": "We measured alterations in a noxious visceromotor reflex in rabbits subjected to intestinal distension, after i.m., extradural or intrathecal injection of midazolam or saline. Spinal catheters were inserted and tunnelled surgically and the animals allowed to recover for 2 weeks. A balloon catheter was placed in the distal part of the descending colon, in the awake rabbit. Intraluminal pressures were increased continuously by water instillation until a sudden withdrawal of the pelvis was observed. Pressure values at withdrawal threshold were recorded immediately before the injection and after 5, 15 and 30 min. Pain thresholds were unaltered after saline. Extradural midazolam 12.5-250 micrograms kg-1 produced a dose-dependent increase in the percent maximum possible effect ranging from 7% after the smallest dose to 80%. Similar dose-dependent effects were observed after intrathecal injection of midazolam 25-62.5 micrograms kg-1. Extradural and intrathecal, but not i.v. injection of flumazenil 25 micrograms kg-1 (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) reduced the antinociceptive effect of extradural and intrathecal midazolam to pretreatment levels. A segmental effect of intrathecal midazolam was demonstrated using transcutaneous electrical stimulation in the areas of the neck and the lower back. The effect of intrathecal midazolam 62.5 microrgrams kg-1 was restricted to the lumbar region, demonstrating a selective action on the spinal cord. Thus extradural and intrathecal midazolam produced a dose-dependent effect on the reflex response to visceral distension in rabbits. This effect is caused by a direct spinal action on benzodiazepine receptors in the spinal cord.",

We have compared plasma concentrations of midazolam after nasal, rectal and i.v. administration in 45 children (aged 2-9 yr; weight 10-30 kg) undergoing minor urological surgery. General anaesthesia consisted of spontaneous respiration of halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen via a face mask. After administration of atropine and fentanyl i.v., children were allocated randomly to receive midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 by the nasal, rectal or i.v. route. In the nasal group, children received 50% of the dose of midazolam in each nostril. In the rectal group, midazolam was given rectally via a cannula. Venous blood samples were obtained before and up to 360 min after administration of the drug. Plasma concentrations of midazolam were measured by gas chromatography and electron capture detection. After nasal and rectal administration, midazolam Cmax was 182 (SD 57) ng ml-1 within 12.6 (5.9) min, and 48 (16) ng ml-1 within 12.1 (6.4) min, respectively.

Devazepide did not affect calming caused by sucrose infusions, which do not release CCK. Moreover, devazepide did not reduce the elevated pain limen caused by milk or fat infusions.

    "90": "Results of a previous study showed that angiotensin II (AII) inhibited the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal granule cells in response to dorsomedial perforant path stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rats. The results of present experiments demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of LTP induction under the same conditions due to ethanol (EtOH) administered by stomach tube and diazepam (DZ) injected IP. The inhibition of LTP induction by EtOH and DZ can be blocked by saralasin (SAR) applied directly to the dorsal hippocampus and by lorsartan (DuP 753) administered IP. Lorsartan or a metabolite crosses the blood-brain barrier because it also blocks the inhibition of LTP induction due to AII administration directly into the dorsal hippocampus. Lorsartan is a competitive antagonist of the AT1 subtype AII receptor. Therefore, the AII and the EtOH and DZ inhibition of LTP induction are mediated by the AII subtype receptor AT1. AIII and the AT2 antagonist PD123319 did not produce any significant effects. These in vivo effects can be reproduced in brain slices and therefore cannot be attributed to other factors, such as the urethane. In addition, electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) inhibits LTP induction, and the inhibition can be blocked by SAR. These data on LH stimulation indicate that LH AII-containing neurons send axons into the hippocampus that inhibit the induction of LTP. These results not only provide new information on a neurotransmitter involved in the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines and ethanol-induced memory blackouts, but also testable hypotheses concerning recent observations that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors elevate mood and improve certain cognitive processes in the elderly.", 
    "91": "The anticonvulsant effect of [(+/-)-2-[(inden-7-yloxy)methyl]morpholine (indeloxazine) HCl, a new cerebral activator, was investigated in rats against kindled seizures from the amygdala, an assumed model of secondarily generalized seizures in human. Indeloxazine (0.25-10 mg/kg, IP) dose-dependently depressed the kindled seizure and shortened the evoked amygdaloid afterdischarge. A high dose of indeloxazine (40 mg/kg, IP), however, induced generalized seizures. Comparison of the effects on the kindled seizures of indeloxazine to those of phenytoin, diazepam, ethanol, and imipramine revealed that the anticonvulsant actions of indeloxazine are similar to those of imipramine but not to those of phenytoin, ethanol, and diazepam. The results suggest that indeloxazine may exert its action through the monoaminergic system in the brain.", 
    "92": "Patients who require mechanical ventilation are often sedated with midazolam. As clinical signs of sedation are often confusing or nonexistent, and there are few adverse side effects when large doses are infused over a period of days, substantial drug accumulation can result in these critically ill patients, despite the short half-life of midazolam. An objective monitor of sedation would help maintain sedation at a constant level despite changing pharmacokinetic values in patients. We undertook this study to describe the electroencephalographic changes which occur with intravenous midazolam in critically ill patients, and to determine if a relationship exists between these changes and the depth of sedation as measured using a clinical scoring method. A series of 31 critically ill patients who required intravenous midazolam during mechanical ventilation were studied. Four different levels of sedation were defined ranging from execution of verbal commands to no response to suctioning through the tracheal tube or sternal rub. Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained in patients on a daily basis and a concurrent sedation level was determined. High frequency electroencephalogram activity decreased as sedation level increased. This was reflected in decreases in the spectral edge (17.61 to 10.56 Hz (p = 0.0024)), the median frequency (4.27 to 2.56 Hz (p = 0.0278)), and the logarithm of the absolute power in the beta 1 (p = 0.0012), and beta 2 (p < 0.0001) bands.

    "93": "We compared the influence of anesthetic regimens using urethane (U), pentobarbital (P), ether (E), and ketamine/midazolam (K) on the intestinal absorption of several probes using a single-pass perfusion technique in rats. The selected probes were D-glucose (1 mM) for the resistance of the unstirred water layer (UWL), D-glucose (100 mM) for the capacity of carrier-mediated D-glucose transport, L-glucose, and urea for membrane-limited passive transport, and tritiated water (3H2O) for blood flow at the absorption site. The absorbed fraction of D-glucose (1 mM) was the smallest for U and the largest for P, suggesting that the resistance of UWL is the largest for U and the smallest for P. The absorbed fraction of D-glucose (100 mM) was the largest for P (U = E = K < P), suggesting a higher capacity of carrier-mediated D-glucose transport for P. The absorbed fraction of urea was similar for all anesthetics, while that of L-glucose was the smallest for K (U = P = E > K). Although the results for these two markers of membrane-limited passive transport were inconsistent, the passive permeability of the intestinal membrane may be lower when treating with K. The intestinal absorptions of D-glucose (1 and 100 mM), L-glucose, and urea were, in general, lower with any of the anesthetics than under nonanesthesia (N), suggesting increased resistance of UWL and decreased intestinal membrane permeability by carrier-mediated and passive transport under anesthesia. The only exception was the absorption of D-glucose (100 mM) under P, which was comparable to that under N.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "94": "Pharmacokinetics of midazolam in patients with liver damage for hepatectomy was compared to that in patients without liver injury for gastrectomy. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.15 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl. Serum concentration of midazolam was measured at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after midazolam injection. Serum midazolam levels were not significantly different between the two groups at any time. The elimination half-life of midazolam was about 3 times longer in hepatectomy group (24.2 hours) than in the group without liver injury (8.4 hours). Area under the curve of the serum midazolam concentration was larger in the group with liver damage than in the group without it. But distribution volume and clearance of midazolam were not different between the two groups probably because of more blood transfusion and bleeding in hepatectomy group. The recovery time from anesthesia in hepatectomy group was as long as that in the group without liver injury. The results suggest that in patients with liver damage for hepatectomy, the elimination of midazolam is prolonged but its effect is not.",

This finding was associated with a clinical presentation of hypnosedative withdrawal delirium (disorientation, impaired memory, rambling speech with loose associations, paranoia, ideation, restlessness, poor judgment). Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT may provide objective documentation of regional cerebral neurochemical alteration associated with hypnosedative abuse or hypnosedative withdrawal states, whereas surface and volume three-dimensional displays simplify and enhance brain SPECT image interpretation.", 
    "96": "Six healthy volunteers were given a 2-mg dose of alprazolam at 21:00 h and hourly blood samples were collected until 08:00 h the following morning. A control night of hourly blood sampling was undertaken 7 days before Plasma was analyzed for melatonin, cortisol, and alprazolam concentrations. Melatonin concentrations were significantly suppressed by alprazolam at 23:00, midnight, 01:00, 06:00, and 07:00 h. A trend toward suppression was evident from 02:00 to 05:00 h. Cortisol concentrations were also suppressed by alprazolam at several times throughout the night (01:00-04:00 h). Plasma alprazolam levels showed a peak at 3 h and remained relatively high 19-20 h after the dose. The significance of melatonin suppression by alprazolam is discussed in terms of benzodiazepine binding sites and GABA minergic transmission in the human pineal gland, suprachiasmatic nuclei, and retina. Plasma cortisol suppression has been reported for other benzodiazepine drugs, but conflicting data exist for alprazolam. The present results do not support the proposed inhibitory effect of melatonin on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis. It is suggested that there is no simple direct relationship between melatonin and the HPA axis in humans.", 
    "97": "The problem of sedation and analgesia for ventilator-dependent patients was examined in this study. Twenty subjects undergoing elective coronary revascularization surgery at a major medical center were studied. They ranged in age from 49 to 83 years. A randomized, prospective research design was used to place subjects in either an experimental group or a control group. Standard postoperative analgesia with intravenous increments of morphine and midazolam in the control group was compared to treatment with a titratable sufentanil-midazolam infusion in the experimental group. In both groups, hemodynamic variables were measured at selected intervals, sodium nitroprusside consumption was measured, and time to extubation was noted. Data analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups. The more costly sedative-analgesic infusion appeared to be comparable to conventional treatment with incremental morphine and midazolam based on the results of this study.", 
    "98": "Aiming to know the frequency of mental disorders among patients consulting a general hospital emergency ward, 2834 medical records of such patients were retrospectively reviewed. 8.4% of consultations were due to mental disorders. Sixty four percent of patients consulting for mental disorders were women. Anxiety disorders comprised 57.6% of consultations due to mental disorders and intoxications 7.6%. Eighty percent of the latter were consequence of suicidal attempts, being the most common method the use of benzodiazepines. A low percent of these patients were referred to psychiatry. The low frequency of psychiatric referrals and the importance of psychiatric advice in emergency rooms is discussed.", 
    "99": "Mice exposed to a chronic auditory stressor and daily injected with alprazolam (1 mg/kg/day, s.c.) showed a reduction in stress-induced suppression of the in vitro and in vivo activity of phagocytosis, measured using the zymosan particle uptake method and the carbon clearance test, respectively. Pretreatment with Ro-15-1788 (10 mg/kg, s.c.), a central nervous system benzodiazepine antagonist, resulted in suppression of the effects of alprazolam in stressed mice.", 
    "100": "A new form of clinical treatment is proposed for dystonias and torticollis using flunitrazepam (FN), a powerful agonist of all benzodiazepine receptors of GABA neurons. FN has a specific effect in dystonic patients, specially those in which the hypnotic effect of this drug is absent or diminished, thus suggesting the existence of two different neurochemical categories of dystonias.", 
    "101": "Daytime sleepiness after ingestion of midazolam as a hypnotic was quantitatively studied employing the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). We evaluated 20 healthy volunteers, 10 of which received a single oral dose of midazolam (15 mg, one tablet) and 10 of which received placebo, in a double-blind design. Tablets were administered at 2200 h, bedtime. On the following day, all subjects were submitted to a clinical evaluation, a subjective checklist and the MSLT. The mean age was 34.7 +/- 8.9 years in the midazolam and 38.0 +/- 10.6 years in the placebo groups (n.s.). Sex and weight distributions were similar in both groups (n.s.). Clinical evaluation and subjective symptom checklist did not make evident significant differences between midazolam and placebo groups (n.s.). The MSLT was performed at 0900, 1100, 1300, 1500 and 1700 h. Mean sleep latencies were 12.0, 12.7, 8.0, 13.5, 17.0 min in the midazolam group; mean sleep latencies were 13.8, 9.0, 6.9, 9.5, 13.6 min in the placebo group (n.s.). In the single dose, double-blind design here evaluated, midazolam did not show differences in relation to placebo on the following day, detectable by the MSLT.", 
    "102": "1. Chronic ingestion of caffeine by male NIH strain mice alters the density of a variety of central receptors. 2. The density of cortical A1 adenosine receptors is increased by 20%, while the density of striatal A2A adenosine receptors is unaltered. 3. The densities of cortical beta 1 and cerebellar beta 2 adrenergic receptors are reduced by ca. 25%, while the densities of cortical alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors are not significantly altered. Densities of striatal D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors are unaltered. The densities of cortical 5 HT1 and 5 HT2 serotonergic receptors are increased by 26-30%. Densities of cortical muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are increased by 40-50%. The density of cortical benzodiazepine-binding sites associated with GABAA receptors is increased by 65%, and the affinity appears slightly decreased. The density of cortical MK-801 sites associated with NMDA-glutaminergic receptors appear unaltered. 4. The density of cortical nitrendipine-binding sites associated with calcium channels is increased by 18%. 5. The results indicate that chronic ingestion of caffeine equivalent to about 100 mg/kg/day in mice causes a wide range of biochemical alterations in the central nervous system.", 
    "103": "It has been reported that intrathecal (i.t.) injection of CCK-8 showed a marked antagonism to analgesic effects mediated by mu-opioid receptors in rat. The present study was performed to ascertain whether the blockade of endogenously released CCK-8 by potent and selective CCK-A antagonist devazepide and CCK-B antagonist L-365260 would affect opioid analgesia at the spinal cord level. A marked potentiation of the analgesic effect induced by morphine (4 mg/kg, sc) was produced by i.t. injection of 100 ng devazepide or 2.5 ng L-365260. Dose-response curves for the enhancement of the two drugs on morphine analgesia were bell-shaped. Intrathecal injection of 66 ng devazepide or 1.25 ng L-365260 was also shown to potentiate the analgesic effect induced by the selective mu-opioid agonist ohmefentanyl (OMF) (32 ng, i.t.). The dose-response curves were also bell-shaped. Devazepide or L-365260 per se produced no significant changes in rat tail flick latency (TFL). The above results are interpreted to mean that endogenously released CCK-8 in the spinal cord plays an antagonistic role to opioid analgesia, and it is the CCK-B receptors that mediate the anti-opioid effect since the dose of devazepide is 40-50 times higher than that of L-365260."
