The condition is characterized by myoclonic jerks, which are worse on action than at rest, and postural lapses, ataxia, and dysarthria. The disability caused by postanoxic myoclonus can be profound, and treatment in the rehabilitation setting is exceptionally challenging. We present 2 patients who suffered from postanoxic myoclonus after an anoxic event, both of whom were successfully treated with a combination of levetiracetam, valproic acid, and clonazepam. These cases act as a framework for discussing the management of postanoxic myoclonus in the clinical setting.", 
    "1": "Characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders have been described and classified about a century ago. Each of these disorders may cause considerable impairment reflecting substantial alterations in cognition, perception, and mood. Though both disease concepts are well established, psychopharmacological treatment strategies, involving first- and second-generation antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and mood stabilizing drugs, often fail to keep their purported alleviating effects on respective characteristic symptom spectra, producing unsatisfactory patient responses. While drug profiles may differ concerning the underlying mechanism of action, the breadth of treatment options remains limited. Besides developing new drugs with different mechanisms of action, side-effect profile and efficacy, it has to be emphasized that repurposed drugs might serve as alternative or adjuvant treatment options for patients, who continue to poorly respond to standard treatment algorithms. Here, we review the current evidence of selected drugs whose repurposed use might expand the range of treatment options for schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.",

    "8": "Recently, the imidazolinone derivative imepitoin has been approved for treatment of canine epilepsy. Imepitoin acts as a low-affinity partial agonist at the benzodiazepine (BZD) site of the GABAA receptor and is the first compound with such mechanism that has been developed as an antiepileptic drug (AED). This mechanism offers several advantages compared to full agonists, including less severe adverse effects and a lack of tolerance and dependence liability, which has been demonstrated in rodents, dogs, and nonhuman primates. In clinical trials in epileptic dogs, imepitoin was shown to be an effective and safe AED. Recently, seizures in dogs have been proposed as a translational platform for human therapeutic trials on new epilepsy treatments. In the present study, we compared the anticonvulsant efficacy of imepitoin, phenobarbital and the high-affinity partial BZD agonist abecarnil in the timed i.v. pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure threshold test in dogs and, for comparison, in mice. Furthermore, adverse effects of treatments were compared in both species. All drugs dose-dependently increased the PTZ threshold in both species, but anticonvulsant efficacy was higher in dogs than mice. At the doses selected for this study, imepitoin was slightly less potent than phenobarbital in increasing seizure threshold, but markedly more tolerable in both species. Effective doses of imepitoin in the PTZ seizure model were in the same range as those suppressing spontaneous recurrent seizures in epileptic dogs. The study demonstrates that low-affinity partial agonists at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor, such as imepitoin, offer advantages as a new category of AEDs.", 
    "9": "G-protein coupled receptor (GPCRs) drug discovery is a thriving strategy in the pharmaceutical industry. The standard approach uses living cells to test millions of compounds in a high-throughput format. Typically, changes in the intracellular levels of key elements in the signaling cascade are monitored using fluorescence or luminescence read-out systems, which require external equipment for signal acquisition. In this work, thin-film amorphous silicon photodiodes with an integrated fluorescence filter were developed to capture the intracellular calcium dynamics in response to the activation of the endogenous muscarinic M1 GPCR of HEK 293T cells. Using the new device it was possible to characterize the potency of carbachol (EC50=10.5 \u00b5M) and pirenzepine (IC50=4.2 \u03bcM), with the same accuracy as standard microscopy optical systems. The smaller foot-print provided by the detection system makes it an ideal candidate for the future integration in microfluidic devices for drug discovery.", 
    "10": "We describe a 62-year-old man with a sporadic form of hyperekplexia who presented with an unsteady gait, present since the age of 47. His clinical examination revealed an insecure broad-based gait and difficulty with tandem walking but no other abnormalities. For nearly a decade the patient was misdiagnosed with an idiopathic ataxia. A video electroencephalogram combined with an electromyogram during sudden auditory stimulus demonstrated an excessive startle response. An extensive work-up ruled out all the known causes of symptomatic hyperekplexia including anti-glycine receptor antibodies. Treatment with clonazepam markedly reduced the threshold and intensity of the startle response, enabling him to recover independence. Hyperekplexia is frequently associated with an awkward and hesitating gait, but these gait abnormalities might be confused with other causes of gait disorders if one is not aware of this disease. We report this patient to highlight that a correct diagnosis of hyperekplexia is crucial, because its treatment may change quality of life.",

    "16": "Tumescent anesthesia makes it feasible to perform liposuction in an office setting. There are often patients who desire extensive liposuction on approximately 30% of total body surface area, which means the lidocaine total dose might be over the dosing recommendation. So the segmental infiltration is applied, although the concentration of lidocaine in tumescent fluid is gradually reduced to 0.0252%. Moreover, supplemental intravenous (IV) sedation using monitored anesthesia care is usually applied concurrently to help alleviate discomfort and pain of the patients during tumescent anesthetic infusion and fat extraction which in turn increases the risks of potential lidocaine toxicity due to possible drug interactions. This study was to demonstrate the safety of segmental infiltration of tumescent fluid with lower lidocaine concentration combined with IV sedation in extensive liposuction and determine whether the risk of lidocaine toxicity is increased in this protocol. Ten female patients who requested the extensive liposuction participated in the study. The targeted areas were divided into 2 segments and treated in turn in 1 session. Lidocaine (1600 mg) was infiltrated into the first segment, and approximately 928 mg lidocaine was subsequently infiltrated after accomplishment of the first segment operation. Serum levels of lidocaine were taken every 4 hours during the first 24 hours after the second infiltration. The average time of the procedure is 222 (33) minutes. The dose and total amount of lidocaine injected are 40.7 (5.8) mg/kg and 2528.2 (155.2) mg, respectively. The total volume of the infusates and aspirates are 9918.1 (494) and 6325 (1461.6) mL, respectively, the ratio of total infusates to total aspirates is 1.66 (0.45). The total aspirated fat and fluids are 3280 (1051.8) and 3045 (824.1) mL, respectively. The peak lidocaine levels [2.18 (0.63) \u03bcg/mL] occurred after 12 to 20 hours [16.4 (2.27) hours]. No significant correlation between dose per kilogram body weight or total dose of lidocaine infiltrated and its peak levels or time existed. The extensive liposuction covering the 30% total body surface areas was well tolerated by the patients under tumescent anesthesia in combination with the supplemental IV sedation. Our previous study on the fluid management has demonstrated the risk of hypovolemia or fluid overload is very low with this technique, although the patients who received only maintenance fluid (500 mL) in the operating room and could discharge and resume oral intake after 6 hours of recovery room stay. The adequate anesthesia support is available in our office-based setting with adequate recovery facilities in place. It has a high margin of safety, without increasing of lidocaine toxicity or adverse cardiopulmonary sequelae while using a segmental tumescent infiltration with lower concentration of lidocaine.", 
    "17": "To explore the impacts of intellectual disability (ID) on psychotropic medication use, length of hospital stay (LOS) and direct hospitalization costs during inpatient treatment for acute bipolar episodes, all 17,899 index hospitalizations due to acute bipolar episodes between 1998 and 2007 in Taiwan were identified from a total population health insurance claims database, amongst which 544 subjects had a concomitant diagnosis of ID. Pattern of psychotropic medication use, LOS, discharge outcome and direct costs during hospitalization were compared between bipolar patients with ID and without ID and multivariate models controlling for major cost confounders were used to explore the impacts of ID on LOS, discharge outcome and inpatient costs. The results indicated that, compared to bipolar patients without ID, bipolar patients with ID were younger, had longer LOS and received significantly lower daily equivalent dosages of antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, lithium and benzodiazepines. Significantly more bipolar patients with ID could not be discharged successfully. The longer LOS possibly reflected slower clinical stabilization, conservative use of medications and difficulty in community placement. The lower average daily reimbursements indicated that treatment of bipolar patients with ID were under-funded, whereas the higher total direct costs resulting from prolonged LOS placed greater economic straint on healthcare system. The findings support that bipolar patients with ID are clinically unique but relatively under-supported during acute hospitalization. Modifying current pharmacological intervention, health care resources allocation and community supporting structure is paramount to reducing LOS and improving hospitalization outcome.",

    "20": "Current evidence suggests that functional status is an important outcome of pharmacologic treatments in older people. At the moment, studies have shown diverse effects of medications on functional status. For example, some have shown potentially detrimental effects, while others have found improvements on physical function in elders. Overall, suboptimal prescribing and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may negatively affect functional status. The use of selected drugs acting on central nervous system (CNS), e.g. benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, is generally associated with an increased risk of functional decline. The greater sensitivity of older people to these drugs, together with age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, account for the observed detrimental effect and suggests a cautious approach to older and frail patients when prescribing CNS agents. On the other hand, selected drugs may slow or delay functional decline in older people. In particular, drugs aimed at targeting sarcopenia (loss in muscle mass and strength), such as testosterone in androgen deficiency, ACE-inhibitors, vitamin D and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methyl butyrate (HMB), as well as the recently developed selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) may hold extreme importance. This review will provide available evidence of the diverse impacts of drug medications on functional status in older persons.",

There were relatively little good data and most trials are too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects.

Positive predictive error (PPE) and negative predictive error (NPE) rates were used to assess model performance, based on a cutoff of 1.25-fold change in midazolam area under the curve (AUC) by inhibitor. For reversible inhibition, basic models using total or unbound systemic inhibitor concentration [I] had high NPE rates (46-47%), whereas those using intestinal luminal ([I]gut) values had no NPE but a higher PPE. All basic models for time-dependent inhibition had no NPE and reasonable PPE rates (15-18%). Mechanistic static models that incorporate all interaction mechanisms and organ specific [I] values (enterocyte and hepatic inlet) provided a higher predictive precision, a slightly increased NPE, and a reasonable PPE. Various cutoffs for predicting the likelihood of CYP3A inhibition were evaluated for mechanistic models, and a cutoff of 1.25-fold change in midazolam AUC appears appropriate.",

In the perspective of a risk management principle, the drug agencies have reacted in concordance with the slowly growing knowledge of adverse drug reactions and have sharpened the information to the prescribers and the public over time.

    "37": "Drugs that enhance GABAergic inhibition alleviate inflammatory and neuropathic pain after spinal application. This antihyperalgesia occurs mainly through GABAA receptors (GABAARs) containing \u03b12 subunits (\u03b12-GABAARs). Previous work indicates that potentiation of these receptors in the spinal cord evokes profound antihyperalgesia also after systemic administration, but possible synergistic or antagonistic actions of supraspinal \u03b12-GABAARs on spinal antihyperalgesia have not yet been addressed. Here we generated two lines of GABAAR-mutated mice, which either lack \u03b12-GABAARs specifically from the spinal cord, or, which express only benzodiazepine-insensitive \u03b12-GABAARs at this site. We analyzed the consequences of these mutations for antihyperalgesia evoked by systemic treatment with the novel non-sedative benzodiazepine site agonist HZ166 in neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Wild-type mice and both types of mutated mice had similar baseline nociceptive sensitivities and developed similar hyperalgesia. However, antihyperalgesia by systemic HZ166 was reduced in both mutated mouse lines by about 60% and was virtually indistinguishable from that of global point-mutated mice, in which all \u03b12-GABAARs were benzodiazepine insensitive. The major (\u03b12-dependent) component of GABAAR-mediated antihyperalgesia was therefore exclusively of spinal origin, whereas supraspinal \u03b12-GABAARs had neither synergistic nor antagonistic effects on antihyperalgesia. Our results thus indicate that drugs that specifically target \u03b12-GABAARs exert their antihyperalgesic effect through enhanced spinal nociceptive control. Such drugs may therefore be well-suited for the systemic treatment of different chronic pain conditions.", 
    "38": "Patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in an operational measure of sensorimotor gating: prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle. PPI is the normal reduction in the startle response caused by a low intensity non-startling stimulus (prepulse) which is presented shortly before the startle stimulus (pulse). MK-801 is an NMDA receptor-antagonist known to produce hyperactivity, deficits in prepulse inhibition and social withdrawal, behaviors which correlate well with some of the positive, cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The inferior colliculus (IC) is a critical part of the auditory pathway mediating acoustic PPI. The activation of the IC by the acoustic prepulse reduces startle magnitude. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to elucidate the role of glutamatergic transmission in the IC on the expression of acoustic PPI. For that we investigated whether NMDA receptor stimulation or blockade would affect this response. Unilateral microinjections of NMDA (30 nmol/0.5 \u03bcL) into the IC did not alter PPI while microinjections of MK-801 (30 nmol/0.5 \u03bcL) into this structure disrupted PPI. We also examined the ability of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (5.0mg/kg; i.p.) to reverse the disruption of pre-pulse inhibition produced by unilateral microinjections of MK-801 into the IC of rats. Pretreatment with olanzapine blocked MK-801-induced disruption of PPI. Altogether, these results suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms of the IC are involved in the expression of PPI in rodents and that this response is sensitive to atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.", 
    "39": "Allopregnanolone (3\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b1-pregnan-20-one) is a major cholesterol-derived neurosteroid in the central nervous system and is synthesized from progesterone by steroidogenic enzymes, 5\u03b1-reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme) and 3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The pathophysiological role of allopregnanolone in neuropsychiatric disorders has been highlighted in several investigations. The changes in neuroactive steroid levels are detected in stress and stress-related disorders including anxiety, panic and depression. The changes in allopregnanolone in response to acute stressor tend to restore the homeostasis by dampening the hyper-activated HPA axis. However, long standing stressors leading to development of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety are associated with decrease in the allopregnanolone levels. GABAA receptor complex has been considered as the primary target of allopregnanolone and majority of its inhibitory actions are mediated through GABA potentiation or direct activation of GABA currents. The role of progesterone receptors in producing the late actions of allopregnanolone particularly in lordosis facilitation has also been described. Moreover, recent studies have also described the involvement of other multiple targets including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate, dopamine, opioids, oxytocin, and calcium channels. The present review discusses the various aspects of allopregnanolone in stress and stress-related disorders including anxiety, depression and panic.",

Our investigation sought to evaluate the swimming behavior of zebrafish against a water current using the newly developed Spinning Task. Zebrafish were individually placed in a beaker containing a spinning magnetic stirrer and their latency to be swept into the whirlpool was recorded. We characterized that larger fish (>4 cm) and lower rpm decreased the swimming time in the Spinning Task. There was also a dose-related reduction in swimming after acute treatment with haloperidol, valproic acid, clonazepam, and ethanol, which alter coordination. Importantly, at doses that reduced swimming time in the Spinning Task, these drugs influenced absolute turn angle (ethanol increased and the other drugs decreased), but had no effect of distance travelled in a regular water tank. These results suggest that the Spinning Task is a useful protocol to add information to the assessment of zebrafish motor behavior.",

These two patients not only improved in terms of their clinical RBD symptoms but also exhibited a decrease in the proportion of REM sleep without atonia (from 8.5% to 3.5% and from 10.9% to 3.9% in the two patients). Although clonazepam is the standard first-line therapy for the treatment of RBD, ramelteon might be an effective treatment alternative in patients with RBD who cannot take clonazepam due to either ineffectiveness or adverse effects.",

    "54": "Pulp and paper wood feedstocks have been previously implicated as a source of chemicals with the ability to interact with or disrupt key neuroendocrine endpoints important in the control of reproduction. We tested nine Canadian conifers commonly used in pulp and paper production as well as 16 phytochemicals that have been observed in various pulp and paper mill effluent streams for their ability to interact in vitro with the enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), and bind to the benzodiazepine-binding site of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-BZD). These neuroendocrine endpoints are also important targets for treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, epilepsy, or depression. MAO and GAD were inhibited by various conifer extracts of different polarities, including major feedstocks such as balsam fir, black spruce, and white spruce. MAO was selectively stimulated or inhibited by many of the tested phytochemicals, with inhibition observed by a group of phenylpropenes (e.g. isoeugenol and vanillin). Selective GAD inhibition was also observed, with all of the resin acids tested being inhibitory. GABA(A)-BZD ligand displacement was also observed. We compiled a table identifying which of these phytochemicals have been described in each of the species tested here. Given the diversity of conifer species and plant chemicals with these specific neuroactivities, it is reasonable to propose that MAO and GAD inhibition reported in effluents is phytochemical in origin. We propose disruption of these neuroendocrine endpoints as a possible mechanism of reproductive inhibition, and also identify an avenue for potential research and sourcing of conifer-derived neuroactive natural products.",

No information is available on the predictors of psychiatric hospitalization during maintenance treatment with olanzapine long-acting injection (olanzapine-LAI) or how the risk of hospitalization differs between olanzapine-LAI and oral olanzapine. This study aimed to identify the predictors of psychiatric hospitalization during maintenance treatment with olanzapine-LAI and assessed four parameters: hospitalization prevalence, incidence rate, duration, and the time to first hospitalization. Olanzapine-LAI was also compared with a sub-therapeutic dose of olanzapine-LAI and with oral olanzapine.", 
    "56": "This was a post hoc exploratory analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind study comparing the safety and efficacy of olanzapine-LAI (pooled active depot groups: 405 mg/4 weeks, 300 mg/2 weeks, and 150 mg/2 weeks) with oral olanzapine and sub-therapeutic olanzapine-LAI (45 mg/4 weeks) during 6 months' maintenance treatment of clinically stable schizophrenia outpatients (n=1064). The four psychiatric hospitalization parameters were analyzed for each treatment group. Within the olanzapine-LAI group, patients with and without hospitalization were compared on baseline characteristics. Logistic regression and Cox's proportional hazards models were used to identify the best predictors of hospitalization. Comparisons between the treatment groups employed descriptive statistics, the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox's proportional hazards models.",

    "60": "Translocator protein (TSPO) present in the outer mitochondrial membrane has been suggested to be critical for cholesterol import, a rate-limiting step for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Despite the importance of steroidogenesis in regulating reproductive functions, the developmental profile of TSPO expression in the gonads and accessory sex organs has not been completely characterized. As a first step towards understanding the function of TSPO, we studied its expression in male and female murine reproductive organs. We examined testes and ovaries at embryonic days 14.5 and 18.5, and postnatal days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 56 of development. In the adult testis, TSPO was expressed in both Leydig cells and Sertoli cells. In the developing testes TSPO expression was seen in immature Sertoli cells, fetal Leydig cells and gonocytes. In the ovary, TSPO was expressed in the ovarian surface epithelium, interstitial cells granulosa cells and luteal cells. Corpora lutea of ovaries from pregnant mice showed strong expression of TSPO. In the developing ovary, TSPO expression was seen in the squamous pregranulosa cells associated with germ line cysts, together with progressively increasing expression in interstitial cells and the ovarian surface epithelium. In adult mice, the epithelia of other reproductive tissues like the epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicle, oviduct and uterus also showed distinct patterns of TSPO expression. In summary, TSPO expression in both male and female reproductive tissues was not only restricted to steroidogenic cells. Expression in Sertoli cells, ovarian surface epithelium, efferent ductal epithelium, prostatic epithelium, seminal vesiclular epithelium, uterine epithelium and oviductal epithelium suggest either previously unknown sites for de novo steroidogenesis or functions for TSPO distinct from its well-studied role in steroid hormone production.", 
    "61": "Infants are at risk of developing symptoms of Poor Neonatal Adaptation (PNA) after exposure to psychotropic drugs in utero. Such symptoms are largely similar after exposure to antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines and consist of mostly mild neurologic, autonomic, respirator and gastro-intestinal abnormalities. Most symptoms develop within 48 hours after birth and last for 2-6 days. After exposure to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), mirtazapine or venlafaxine in utero, breastfeeding is presumably protective for development of PNA. The dosage of antidepressants does not seem to be related to the risk of PNA. In order to objectify possible symptoms of PNA, observation of mother and child at the maternity ward is advisable. If PNA symptoms do not occur, an observation period of 48-72 hours is sufficient. This applies to all types of psychotropic drugs. When PNA symptoms are present it is advisable to observe the infant until the symptoms are fully resolved. Observation can be performed by trained nurses using the Finnegan scoring list. This observation list should be administered every 8 hours. Interpretation of the scores should be carried out by a paediatrician. In most cases symptoms are non-specific. Therefore other diagnoses, such as infection or neurologic problems, have to be excluded. When there is any doubt on possible intoxications during pregnancy, toxicological urine screening is indicated. Most cases of PNA are mild, of short duration and self-limiting without need for treatment. Supporting measures such as frequent small feedings, swaddling and increase of skin to skin contact with the mother is usually sufficient. In case of severe PNA it is advised to admit the infant to the Neonatal Care Unit (NCU). Phenobarbital is a safe therapeutic option. There seem to be no major long term effects; however, additional studies are necessary in order to draw definite conclusions.", 
    "62": "The relationship of drug concentrations between oral fluid and whole blood was evaluated by studying the linear correlation of concentrations and calculating the oral fluid to blood concentration ratios (OF/B) for different substances. Paired oral fluid and whole blood samples were collected from volunteers and persons suspected of drug use in four European countries. Oral fluid samples were collected with the Saliva\u2219Sampler\u2122 device. All samples were analyzed for drugs of abuse and psychoactive medicines with validated gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric methods. The median OF/B ratios were, for amphetamines 19-22, for opioids 1.8-11, for cocaine and metabolites 1.7-17, for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 14, for benzodiazepines 0.035-0.33, and for other psychoactive medicines 0.24-3.7. Most of the these results were close to theoretical values based on the physicochemical properties of the drugs and to values presented earlier, but there was a lot of inter-individual variation in the OF/B ratios. For all substances, except for lorazepam (R(2) \u2009=\u20090.031) and THC (R(2) \u2009=\u20090.030), a correlation between the oral fluid and whole blood concentrations was observed. Due to large variation seen here, drug findings in oral fluid should not be used to estimate the corresponding concentrations in whole blood (or vice versa). However, detection of drugs in oral fluid is a sign of recent drug use and oral fluid can be used for qualitative detection of several drugs, e.g. in epidemiological prevalence studies. By optimizing the sampling and the analytical cut-offs, the potential of oral fluid as a confirmation matrix could be enhanced.",

Twenty-eight male patients underwent lower third molar extraction under sedation with midazolam and nitrous oxide. Objective (salivary cortisol dosage) and subjective (Corah Dental Anxiety Scale) data have been obtained. By salivary cortisol, 40 minutes after midazolam administration, there has been a statistically significant difference compared with the mean baseline value. Midazolam was the most effective sedation method for reducing salivary cortisol level.",

The method relies on the catalytic effect of 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium Ethylsulfate/copper on the chemiluminescence reaction of Benzodiazepines, the oxidation of Benzodiazepines with hydrogen peroxide in natural medium. The influences of various experimental parameters such as solution pH, the ratio of 1-Ethyl-3 Methylimidazolium ethylsulfate concentration to copper ion, the type of buffer and the concentration of CL reagents were investigated. Under the optimum condition, the proposed method was satisfactorily applied for the determination of these drugs in tablets and urine without the interference of their potential impurities.",

Three 52-min intravenous infusions were administered: ketamine (.41 mg/kg or .71 mg/kg) or lorazepam 2 mg, counterbalanced into three orderings in which ketamine .41 mg/kg always preceded the .71 mg/kg dose. Infusions were separated by 48 hours, and assessments occurred at baseline and at 24 hours postinfusion. Outcomes were change between postinfusion and preinfusion values for: 1) motivation to quit cocaine scores with the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment; and 2) sums of visual analogue scale craving ratings administered during cue exposure.",

    "73": "The oxytocinergic system promotes social behavior and reduces anxiety. The significant roles and functional interactions of the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in the regulation of fear provide a unique experimental setting to examine the effects of oxytocin on extinction of fear. In this study we manipulated the oxytocin system at different time points in either the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC), the basolateral amygadala (BLA) or in the central amygdala (CeA). Manipulations of the oxytocin following retrieval of fear in the IL-mPFC resulted in facilitation of subsequent extinction. In contrast, in the BLA, manipulating the oxytocinergic system after the retrieval of fear was associated with contrasting effects; whereas the microinjection of exogenous synthetic oxytocin was associated with impaired extinction, the microinfusion of WAY-267474 facilitated extinction. In contrast, intra-BLA microinfusion of the selective agonist TGOT did not affect freezing. Oxytocin manipulations in the CeA had no effect on subsequent extinction. Contrasting effects were also found when the drugs were injected before conditioning. Whereas oxytocin manipulations in the BLA enhanced fear and impaired extinction, in the CeA the microinfusion of the selective agonists (WAY-267474 and TGOT), but not synthetic oxytocin, resulted in reduced freezing levels. These results show that in the rat, the oxytocinergic system differentially regulated fear and extinction in region and temporal-dependent manners and further join data to show that contrary to the prevailing belief that oxytocin is solely involved in reducing fear, oxytocin can also act as an enhancer of fear responses.", 
    "74": "Comorbid depression and anxiety disorders occur in up to 25% of general practice patients. About 85% of patients with depression have significant anxiety, and 90% of patients with anxiety disorder have depression. Symptomatology may initially seem vague and non-specific. A careful history and examination with relevant investigations should be used to make the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is made, rating scales may identify illness severity and help in monitoring treatment progress. Both the depression disorder and the specific anxiety disorder require appropriate treatment. Psychological therapies, such as cognitive behaviour therapy, and antidepressants, occasionally augmented with antipsychotics, have proven benefit for treating both depression and anxiety. Benzodiazepines may help alleviate insomnia and anxiety but not depression. They have dependency and withdrawal issues for some people, and may increase the risk of falls in older people. Despite the availability of treatments, 40% of patients with depression or anxiety do not seek treatment, and of those who do, less than half are offered beneficial treatment.", 
    "75": "The role of alcohol in facial trauma is recognised but we know of no research on the possible contribution made by the use of illicit drugs in patients with facial injuries, or the interactions that may occur during anaesthesia. We aimed to find out whether illegal drugs were identified in the urine of patients with maxillofacial injuries, what substances were present, and whether patients were willing to disclose use of drugs at the time of injury. Over a 12-month period we prospectively studied consecutive patients with facial injuries who were referred by accident and emergency (A&E) to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) for inpatient assessment and treatment within 24 h of injury. Anonymised data on patients were obtained from questionnaires that were linked to a urine sample provided on admission. Results were obtained using immunoassay and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. A total of 105 patients with facial injuries were eligible and 95 (90%) provided a urine sample and completed the questionnaire; 2 samples were of insufficient volume and were discarded before analysis. Twelve patients (13%) admitted using drugs at the time of injury but 44 (47%) samples tested positive for illegal drugs; fewer showed the presence of alcohol (n=37; 40%). Use of drugs, although often denied, is widespread among patients with facial injuries. It is important to consider the role that drugs have in patients who present with traumatic injuries, the interactions misused drugs may have with anaesthesia, and any possible benefits that targeted prevention strategies would have in this group.", 
    "76": "This study is the first comparative trial of sleep medications at high altitude. We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of temazepam and acetazolamide at an altitude of 3540 meters. 34 healthy trekkers with self-reports of high-altitude sleep disturbance were randomized to temazepam 7.5 mg or acetazolamide 125 mg taken at bedtime for one night. The primary outcome was sleep quality on a 100 mm visual analog scale. Additional measurements were obtained with actigraphy; pulse oximetry; and questionnaire evaluation of sleep, daytime drowsiness, daytime sleepiness, and acute mountain sickness. Sixteen subjects were randomized to temazepam and 18 to acetazolamide. Sleep quality on the 100 mm visual analog scale was higher for temazepam (59.6, SD 20.1) than acetazolamide (46.2, SD 20.2; p=0.048). Temazepam also demonstrated higher subjective sleep quality on the Groningen Sleep Quality Scale (3.5 vs. 6.8, p=0.009) and sleep depth visual analog scale (60.3 vs. 41.4, p=0.028). The acetazolamide group reported significantly more awakenings to urinate (1.8 vs. 0.5, p=0.007). No difference was found with regards to mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (84.1 vs. 84.4, p=0.57), proportion of the night spent in periodic breathing, relative desaturations, sleep onset latency, awakenings, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Stanford Sleepiness Scale scores, daytime drowsiness, or change in self-reported Lake Louise Acute Mountain Sickness scores. We conclude that, at current recommended dosing, treatment of high-altitude sleep disturbance with temazepam is associated with increased subjective sleep quality compared to acetazolamide.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of oral yeasts in oral lichen planus (OLP) patients and control subjects, and to perform a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors that influence oral Candida infection in OLP patients. In this cross-sectional study, 90 new patients with OLP and 90 sex- and age-matched control subjects with no mucosal lesions were interviewed about their health status, use of medication, and smoking and alcohol habits. Swab and unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected and salivary pH was measured. A positive Candida culture was more prevalent among OLP patients (48.9%) than among control subjects (26.7%). Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species in both groups. By logistic regression analysis, unstimulated whole salivary flow rates of 0.11-0.24 ml min(-1) (OR = 5.90) and 0.25-0.32 ml min(-1) (OR = 3.51) and benzodiazepine anxiolytics intake (OR = 8.30) were independently associated with the presence of Candida among OLP patients. Age, denture wearing, levels of dentition, decreased salivary pH, antihypertensive drugs, and alcohol consumption were not associated with oral Candida infection in OLP patients. The results indicate that data on benzodiazepine anxiolytics intake and evaluation of unstimulated whole salivary flow rate should be considered as part of the clinical evaluation to identify OLP patients at risk for Candida infection.",

The subjects aged of 65 years or more are the most represented among the BZD users in France. Frequency of BZD use varies according to various studies from 39 to 55% in this age group. Leading a lonely life is associated with the use of psychotropic drugs among retired people (OR=1.7). Vulnerability at this age must take into account not only polypathology, but also the faster aging of a minority of the population under opiate drugs substitution treatment (OST), more subjects to drugs interaction. Drug addiction among elderly often reflects the drift of \"lawful\" doctor's instructions that leads to an increase in drugs use. The difficulty has to do with a lack of specificity of diagnosis of addiction at this age, but perhaps also with physicans'instructions in the aged. Some authors suggest that continued and prolonged use should be considered the main criterion for BZD addiction at this age, with or without increase in doses and failed attempt at cessation.

The treatment is a supportive one. If the patient is agitated, you can give him haloperidol or a benzodiazepine. Before discharge, the patient should see the alcohologic team.", 
    "98": "Consistent evidence indicates the involvement of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we compared serum BDNF in 624 subjects: 266 patients affected by AD, 28 by frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 40 by Lewy body dementia (LBD), 91 by vascular dementia (VAD), 30 by PD, and 169 controls. Our results evidenced lower BDNF serum levels in AD, FTD, LBD, and VAD patients (P < 0.001) and a higher BDNF concentration in patients affected by PD (P = 0.045). Analyses of effects of pharmacological treatments suggested significantly higher BDNF serum levels in patients taking mood stabilizers/antiepileptics (P = 0.009) and L-DOPA (P < 0.001) and significant reductions in patients taking benzodiazepines (P = 0.020). In conclusion, our results support the role of BDNF alterations in neurodegenerative mechanisms common to different forms of neurological disorders and underline the importance of including drug treatment in the analyses to avoid confounding effects.", 
    "99": "A 45-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department because of twitching of the head. The patient took a tablet of sumatriptan every 3-4 h because of increasing head pain after a car accident. Owing to depression, the patient was on long-term treatment with venlafaxine. The patient presented as hypertensive, tachycardic, with dyskinesia and spontaneous myoclonic movements of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. In a CT scan of the head and cervical spine any fractures, bleeding or damage of the vessels after the accident could be ruled out. After discontinuation of all serotonergic agents, administration of lorazepam symptoms resolved 24 h after the last intake of sumatriptan. Serotonin syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, which requires a high-index of diagnostic suspicion. Clinical features include a broad spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening manifestations. Management is based on removal of precipitating drugs and symptomatic care including benzodiazepines.",

    "102": "A total of 741/4405 (17 %) questionnaires were returned. Compared to 2007 we documented a further increase of the use of sedation during the performance of esophagogastro-duodenoscopies (EGDs) (82 vs. 74 % in 2007) and colonoscopies (91 vs. 87 % in 2007), accompanied with an increased rate of using propofol as a sedative agent in 97 vs. 74 % of the cases in 2007. In contrast the use of midazolam substantially decreased to 69 % versus 82 % in 2007. Most commonly used sedation regimens are still propofol \u00b1 benzodiazepines (43 vs. 38 % in 2007), while a combination of midazolam \u00b1 opioid decreased to 15 % versus 35 % in 2007. Unchanged to data from 2007, patients were routinely monitored by pulse oximetry (99 %). Routine use of an automated blood pressure monitoring increased to 40 % (versus 29 % in 2007) and the use of electrocardiography monitoring nearly doubled to 24 vs. 13 % in 2007. Supplemental oxygen is nowadays routinely administered in 64 % compared to 34 % of the cases in 2007. Regarding the administration of sedation we observed a profound increase of nurse-administered propofol sedation (NAPS; 73 % in 2011, 39 % in 2007) with a decrease of endoscopist-directed propofol sedation (29 % in 2011 vs. 59 % in 2007). However, monitored anaesthesia care was still only rarely used in Germany (2 %).", 
    "103": "After the implementation of the first national sedation guideline the use of propofol has become the most popular sedation regime in Germany, mainly administered as NAPS by trained nurses as a standard procedure. Automated blood pressure measurements and ECG recording were more often implemented in the monitoring practice and also the routine use of supplemental oxygen has been clearly improved.", 
    "104": "Phenazepam is a potent 1,4-benzodiazepine that has gained notoriety among recreational drug users. First synthesized in Ukraine in the 1970s, it is one of the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines in Russia and other commonwealth of independent state nations, where it is used therapeutically as a prescription drug. Reports of abuse are widespread and several European countries have taken steps to control its use. However, in the USA, phenazepam is not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, nor scheduled under the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Phenazepam is widely available on the Internet, and recreational drug users report a potency 10-fold greater than that of nordiazepam. We report a case of a 24-year-old male driver who was apprehended for impaired driving following a two-vehicle crash. The subject exhibited slurred speech and profound psychomotor impairment. Toxicology testing revealed phenazepam at a concentration of 76 ng/mL in blood, with no other drugs detected. This case report not only demonstrates the potential for adverse traffic safety consequences following the misuse of phenazepam, but also highlights the importance of analytical factors such as immunoassay cutoff concentration, cross-reactivity and comprehensive screening using chromatographic-based techniques for impaired driving investigations.",

Plasma Tmax of clonazepam nanostructured carriers varied from 10-30 min., while their brain Tmax did not exceed 10 min, in comparison with 30 min for iv solution. Although there was no significant difference (p>0.05) between the plasma AUC0-\u221e of the different tested nanocarriers and intravenous one, the increase in brain AUC 0 -\u221e of different nasal formulations in comparison to that of iv administration (3.6 -7.2 fold) confirms direct nose to brain transport via olfactory region. Furthermore, DTE and DTP% confirmed brain targeting of clonazepam following intranasal administration.",

Benzodiazepines are the first choice drugs to be used as emergency medication. This treatment in the early phases of a seizure often implies a 'pre-medical' setting before intervention of medically trained persons. In this paper, we propose \"good practice points\" for first line management of prolonged convulsive seizures in children and adults in a 'pre-medical' setting.",

In the hope that the reduction of amyloid production can help to battle Alzheimer's disease (AD) secretases were suggested to represent a potential therapeutic targets. However, the role of \u03b3-secretase in cellular mechanisms of memory formation under physiological conditions remained to be clarified. To this end, \u03b3-secretase was inhibited by bath-application of DAPT or Compound E and the effects on activity-dependent hippocampal synaptic plasticity and basal synaptic transmission in acute hippocampal slices from Wistar rats were examined. Bath application of DAPT or Compound E over the whole recording period of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) caused a reduction of synaptic potentiation within 1h after 3\u00d71s 100Hz/10min stimulation (HFS) of Schaffer-collateral CA1 synapses. Notably, DAPT and Compound E inhibited effectively long-term potentiation (LTP) of fEPSPs when it was applied after HFS, but not if applied only during the tetanization paradigm. Compounds did not affect basal synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation and NMDA mediated fEPSPs. Our data thus imply that \u03b3-secretase plays a role in LTP and most notably for the persistence of activity dependent synaptic plasticity, presumably through the reduction of endogenous amyloid beta and/or Notch receptor activation. Targeting of \u03b3-secretase to prevent the onset of AD might by itself alter memory formation.",

This article provides resources for the identification and management of drug use during pregnancy for midwives who provide care not only during the prenatal period but also during the intrapartum and postpartum periods. The impact of drug use on newborns can be significant and may require pharmacologic assistance with the transition to extrauterine life. Challenges involved in caring for the woman who is using drugs during pregnancy include ordering toxicology screens on the newborn, alerting social services, and educating the woman about her newborn's progress.

    "123": "This article describes current experimental models of status epilepticus (SE) and neuronal injury for use in the screening of new therapeutic agents. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. SE is an emergency condition associated with continuous seizures lasting more than 30 min. It causes significant mortality and morbidity. SE can cause devastating damage to the brain leading to cognitive impairment and increased risk of epilepsy. Benzodiazepines are the first-line drugs for the treatment of SE, however, many people exhibit partial or complete resistance due to a breakdown of GABA inhibition. Therefore, new drugs with neuroprotective effects against the SE-induced neuronal injury and degeneration are desirable. Animal models are used to study the pathophysiology of SE and for the discovery of newer anticonvulsants. In SE paradigms, seizures are induced in rodents by chemical agents or by electrical stimulation of brain structures. Electrical stimulation includes perforant path and self-sustaining stimulation models. Pharmacological models include kainic acid, pilocarpine, flurothyl, organophosphates and other convulsants that induce SE in rodents. Neuronal injury occurs within the initial SE episode, and animals exhibit cognitive dysfunction and spontaneous seizures several weeks after this precipitating event. Current SE models have potential applications but have some limitations. In general, the experimental SE model should be analogous to the human seizure state and it should share very similar neuropathological mechanisms. The pilocarpine and diisopropylfluorophosphate models are associated with prolonged, diazepam-insensitive seizures and neurodegeneration and therefore represent paradigms of refractory SE. Novel mechanism-based or clinically relevant models are essential to identify new therapies for SE and neuroprotective interventions.",

    "126": "A significant decrease in craving and depressive symptoms was observed from T1 to T2, while SC scores remained stable. At both times, strong positive correlations were observed between craving and depression. Moreover, regression analyses indicated that trait SC significantly moderated the impact of depression on cravings for alcohol.",

    "129": "GABA is thought to function as a paracrine factor in adrenal medullary (AM) cells. Thus, we electrophysiologically and immunologically examined the properties of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) in guinea-pig AM cells. Bath application of GABA produced an inward current at -60 mV in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 32.3 \u03bcM. This GABA-induced current was enhanced by allopregnanolone at concentrations of 0.01 \u03bcM and more. A prior exposure to allopregnanolone resulted in a decrease in an EC50 for GABA in activating GABAARs. The GABA-induced current was suppressed by Zn(2+) in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 18 \u03bcM, whereas it was enhanced by 100 \u03bcM La(3+). The benzodiazepine analog diazepam was three times more potent than zolpidem in enhancing the GABA current, and it was also augmented by L-838,417, which has no action on \u03b11-containing GABAARs. The GABAAR \u03b13, but not \u03b11, and \u03b32 subunits were immunologically detected at the cell periphery. The expression of \u03b13 subunits in PC12 cells was enhanced by glucocorticoid activity. The results indicated that GABAARs in guinea-pig AM cells mainly comprise \u03b13, \u03b2, and \u03b32 subunits and are enhanced by allopreganalone and glucocorticoids may play a major role in the expression of \u03b13 subunits.",

Patients in MMTPs are at particular risk for life stress, and nicotine, as well as other substances like alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine, marijuana, and opiates have been shown to reduce the effects of stress. Use of these addictive substances to cope with stress may precipitate illicit opiate relapse in MMTP patients. In the current study, we examined the relationship between perceived stress and substance abuse.",

Palate with lateral pharyngeal wall obstruction (49.28%) is the most common obstruction type of the retropalatal level and tongue with lateral pharyngeal wall (37.68%) is the most common obstruction type of the retrolingual level. Examining the relation between obstruction site according to body mass index (BMI) and severity of OSAS (apnea hypopnea index, AHI), the lateral pharyngeal wall had an increasing tendency associated with higher BMI and higher AHI. But the lateral pharyngeal wall of both levels was statistically significant associated with higher AHI.",

In this study, we used a combined approach of protein folding, molecular dynamics simulations, docking, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) to elucidate the detailed interaction of the vasopressin receptor V1a (V1aR) with some of its blockers (134). QSAR studies were performed using MLR analysis and were gathered into one group to perform an artificial neural network (ANN) analysis. For each molecule, 1481 molecular descriptors were calculated. Additionally, 15 quantum chemical descriptors were calculated. The final equation was developed by choosing the optimal combination of descriptors after removing the outliers. Molecular modeling enabled us to obtain a reliable tridimensional model of V1aR. The docking results indicated that the great majority of ligands reach the binding site under \u03c0-\u03c0, \u03c0-cation, and hydrophobic interactions. The QSAR studies demonstrated that the heteroatoms N and O are important for ligand recognition, which could explain the structural diversity of ligands that reach V1aR.", 
    "143": "BET family proteins are epigenetic regulators known to control expression of genes involved in cell growth and oncogenesis. Selective inhibitors of BET proteins exhibit potent anti-proliferative activity in a number of hematologic cancer models, in part through suppression of the MYC oncogene and downstream Myc-driven pathways. However, little is currently known about the activity of BET inhibitors in solid tumor models, and whether down-regulation of MYC family genes contributes to sensitivity. Here we provide evidence for potent BET inhibitor activity in neuroblastoma, a pediatric solid tumor associated with a high frequency of MYCN amplifications. We treated a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with a novel small molecule inhibitor of BET proteins, GSK1324726A (I-BET726), and observed potent growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in most cell lines irrespective of MYCN copy number or expression level. Gene expression analyses in neuroblastoma cell lines suggest a role of BET inhibition in apoptosis, signaling, and N-Myc-driven pathways, including the direct suppression of BCL2 and MYCN. Reversal of MYCN or BCL2 suppression reduces the potency of I-BET726-induced cytotoxicity in a cell line-specific manner; however, neither factor fully accounts for I-BET726 sensitivity. Oral administration of I-BET726 to mouse xenograft models of human neuroblastoma results in tumor growth inhibition and down-regulation MYCN and BCL2 expression, suggesting a potential role for these genes in tumor growth. Taken together, our data highlight the potential of BET inhibitors as novel therapeutics for neuroblastoma, and suggest that sensitivity is driven by pleiotropic effects on cell growth and apoptotic pathways in a context-specific manner.", 
    "144": "Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) mediate fast ionotropic neurotransmission. They are proven drug targets in nematodes and arthropods, but are poorly characterized in flatworms. In this study, we characterized the anion-selective, non-acetylcholine-gated Cys-loop LGICs from Schistosoma mansoni. Full-length cDNAs were obtained for SmGluCl-1 (Smp_096480), SmGluCl-2 (Smp_015630) and SmGluCl-3 (Smp_104890). A partial cDNA was retrieved for SmGluCl-4 (Smp_099500/Smp_176730). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that SmGluCl-1, SmGluCl-2, SmGluCl-3 and SmGluCl-4 belong to a novel clade of flatworm glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl) that includes putative genes from trematodes and cestodes. The flatworm GluCl clade was distinct from the nematode-arthropod and mollusc GluCl clades, and from all GABA receptors. We found no evidence of GABA receptors in S. mansoni. SmGluCl-1, SmGluCl-2 and SmGluCl-3 subunits were characterized by two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) in Xenopus oocytes, and shown to encode Cl\u207b-permeable channels gated by glutamate. SmGluCl-2 and SmGluCl-3 produced functional homomers, while SmGluCl-1 formed heteromers with SmGluCl-2. Concentration-response relationships revealed that the sensitivity of SmGluCl receptors to L-glutamate is among the highest reported for GluCl receptors, with EC\u2085\u2080 values of 7-26 \u00b5M. Chloride selectivity was confirmed by current-voltage (I/V) relationships. SmGluCl receptors are insensitive to 1 \u00b5M ivermectin (IVM), indicating that they do not belong to the highly IVM-sensitive GluCl\u03b1 subtype group. SmGluCl receptors are also insensitive to 10 \u00b5M meclonazepam, a schistosomicidal benzodiazepine. These results provide the first molecular evidence showing the contribution of GluCl receptors to L-glutamate signaling in S. mansoni, an unprecedented finding in parasitic flatworms. Further work is needed to elucidate the roles of GluCl receptors in schistosomes and to explore their potential as drug targets.", 
    "145": "Midazolam is a widely used anesthetic of the benzodiazepine class that has shown cytotoxicity and apoptosisinducing activity in neuronal cells and lymphocytes. This study aims to evaluate the effect of midazolam on growth of K562 human leukemia cells and HT29 colon cancer cells. The in vivo effect of midazolam was investigated in BALB/c-nu mice bearing K562 and HT29 cells human tumor xenografts. The results show that midazolam decreased the viability of K562 and HT29 cells by inducing apoptosis and S phase cell-cycle arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. Midazolam activated caspase-9, capspase-3 and PARP indicating induction of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Midazolam lowered mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Midazolam showed reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity through inhibition of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) enzyme activity in K562 cells. Midazolam caused inhibition of pERK1/2 signaling which led to inhibition of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and XIAP and phosphorylation activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bid. Midazolam inhibited growth of HT29 tumors in xenograft mice. Collectively our results demonstrate that midazolam caused growth inhibition of cancer cells via activation of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and inhibited HT29 tumor growth in xenograft mice. The mechanism underlying these effects of midazolam might be suppression of ROS production leading to modulation of apoptosis and growth regulatory proteins. These findings present possible clinical implications of midazolam as an anesthetic to relieve pain during in vivo anticancer drug delivery and to enhance anticancer efficacy through its ROS-scavenging and pro-apoptotic properties.",

In 1955, Hoffmann-La Roche chemist Leo Sternbach serendipitously identified the first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium). By 1960, Hoffmann-La Roche marketed it as Librium, and it pursued molecular modifications for enhanced activity. Valium (diazepam) followed in 1963. Hoffmann-La Roche's competitors also began looking for analogues. Initially, benzodiazepines appeared to be less toxic and less likely to cause dependence than older drugs. A specific improvement was their lack of respiratory depression, a safety concern with barbiturates. Medical professionals greeted benzodiazepines enthusiastically at first, skyrocketing their popularity and patient demand. In the mid-to-late 1970s, benzodiazepines topped all \"most frequently prescribed\" lists. It took 15 years for researchers to associate benzodiazepines and their effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid as a mechanism of action. By the 1980s, clinicians' earlier enthusiasm and propensity to prescribe created a new concern: the specter of abuse and dependence. As information about benzodiazepines, both raising and damning, accumulated, medical leaders and legislators began to take action. The result: individual benzodiazepines and the entire class began to appear on guidelines and in legislation giving guidance on their use. Concurrently, clinicians began to raise concerns about benzodiazepine use by elderly patients, indicating that elders'lesser therapeutic response and heightened sensitivity to side effects demanded prescriber caution. The benzodiazepine story continues to evolve and includes modern-day issues and concerns beyond those ever anticipated.", 
    "147": "While research indicates that benzodiazepine (BZD)-like drugs impair driving performance, it remains unclear (i) how far BZDs affect lane-keeping performance, compared with alcohol and (ii) to what extent this impact can realistically be measured in a simulated environment. To clarify these issues, 16 healthy male drivers who had never previously taken BZDs underwent a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled driving paradigm (with the BZD lorazepam) in both real-world and simulated settings. Two lane-keeping variables, namely inappropriate line crossings (ILCs) and standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), were recorded during the driving sessions. Analyses revealed that (i) a single lorazepam dose (2 mg given by mouth) caused higher SDLP increases than a blood alcohol concentration of above 0.05%, and that (ii) this BZD effect was amplified in the simulated driving setting, mainly for ILCs. As a consequence, we recommend that physicians be made more aware of BZD-related risks and that researchers make a clear distinction between the effects of BZD intake per se and the impact of simulated driving settings.", 
    "148": "We have developed a two-dimensional replica-exchange method for the prediction of protein-ligand binding structures. The first dimension is the umbrella sampling along the reaction coordinate, which is the distance between a protein binding pocket and a ligand. The second dimension is the solute tempering, in which the interaction between a ligand and a protein and water is weakened. The second dimension is introduced to make a ligand follow the umbrella potential more easily and enhance the binding events, which should improve the sampling efficiency. As test cases, we applied our method to two protein-ligand complex systems (MDM2 and HSP 90-alpha). Starting from the configuration in which the protein and the ligand are far away from each other in each system, our method predicted the ligand binding structures in excellent agreement with the experimental data from Protein Data Bank much faster with the improved sampling efficiency than the replica-exchange umbrella sampling method that we have previously developed.", 
    "149": "Meta-analyses showed that psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs) and some cardiac drugs (digoxin, type IA anti-arrhythmics, diuretics) are associated with increased fall risk. Because balance and gait disorders are the most consistent predictors of future falls, falls due to use of these so-called fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) might be partly caused by impairments of postural control that these drugs can induce. Therefore, the effects of FRIDs on postural control were examined by reviewing literature. Electronic databases and reference lists of identified papers were searched until June 2013. Only controlled research papers examining the effects of FRIDs on postural control were included. FRIDs were defined according to meta-analyses as antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, digoxin, type IA anti-arrhythmics, and diuretics. Ninety-four papers were included, of which study methods for quantifying postural control, and the effects of FRIDs on postural control were abstracted. Postural control was assessed with a variety of instruments, mainly evaluating aspects of body sway during quiet standing. In general, postural control was impaired, indicated by an increase in parameters quantifying body sway, when using psychotropic FRIDs. The effects were more pronounced when people were of a higher age, used psychotropics at higher daily doses, with longer half-lives, and administered for a longer period. From the present literature review, it can be concluded that psychotropic drugs cause impairments in postural control, which is probably one of the mediating factors for the increased fall risk these FRIDs are associated with. The sedative effects of these drugs on postural control are reversible, as was proven in intervention studies where FRIDs were withdrawn. The findings of the present literature review highlight the importance of using psychotropic drugs in the older population only at the lowest effective dose and for a limited period of time.",

By adapting the method to a two-chamber setup, the direct handling of carbon monoxide, produced from stable CO precursors, is avoided. The protocol afforded the desired benzophenones with excellent functional group tolerance and in good yields. Substituting the CO precursor, in the CO-producing chamber, with its carbon-13 labeled version generated the corresponding carbon-13 labeled benzophenones. Finally, the developed system was applied in the synthesis and isotope labeling of two pharmaceuticals, nordazepam and Tricor.", 
    "152": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs), which enhance \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA ) receptor-mediated inhibition, are the first-line therapy for treatment of status epilepticus (SE). However, pharmacoresistance to BZDs develops rapidly after SE initiation. This is due to an activity-dependent internalization of BZD-sensitive GABAA receptors during SE. Stiripentol (STP) is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors with a unique subunit selectivity profile. We report that in a rodent model of SE, STP terminates behavioral seizures and remains effective in established SE when seizures have become BZD resistant. The anticonvulsant effects of STP are age dependent, with greater potency in juvenile animals. Whole cell recordings from dentate granule cells in hippocampal slices reveal that STP potentiates GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and tonic GABAergic currents by acting at a site on the GABAA receptor that is separate from the benzodiazepine binding site. This potentiation persists in established SE, whereas potentiation of GABAergic inhibition by BZDs is lost. STP potentiates IPSCs in juvenile animals with greater potency than in adult animals. We suggest that STP, either alone or as add-on therapy, may prove useful in treating established and BZD-resistant status epilepticus. Furthermore, STP may be particularly effective in terminating SE in children when SE is most prevalent.", 
    "153": "sec-Butyl-propylacetamide (SPD) is a one-carbon homolog of valnoctamide (VCD), a chiral constitutional isomer of valproic acid's (VPA) corresponding amide valpromide. VCD has potential as a therapy in epilepsy including status epilepticus (SE) and neuropathic pain, and is currently being developed for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Both VCD and SPD possess two stereogenic carbons in their chemical structure. SPD possesses a unique and broad-spectrum antiseizure profile superior to that of valproic acid (VPA) and better than that of VCD. In addition SPD blocked behavioral- and electrographic-SE induced by pilocarpine and soman (organophosphate nerve gas) and afforded in vivo neuroprotection that was associated with cognitive sparing. VCD has activity similar to that of SPD in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), although at higher doses. The activity of SPD and VCD against SE is superior to that of diazepam in terms of rapid onset, potency, and ability to block SE when given 20-60\u00a0min after seizure onset. When administered 20 and 40\u00a0min after SE onset, SPD (100-174\u00a0mg/kg) produced long-lasting efficacy (e.g., 4-8\u00a0h) against soman-induced convulsive and electrographic SE in both rats and guinea pigs. SPD activity in the pilocarpine and soman-induced SE models when administered 20-60\u00a0min after seizure onset, differentiates SPD from benzodiazepines and all other antiepileptic drugs .", 
    "154": "Benzodiazepines are the current first-line standard-of-care treatment for status epilepticus but fail to terminate seizures in about one third of cases. Synaptic GABAA receptors, which mediate phasic inhibition in central circuits, are the molecular target of benzodiazepines. As status epilepticus progresses, these receptors are internalized and become functionally inactivated, conferring benzodiazepine resistance, which is believed to be a major cause of treatment failure. GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator neuroactive steroids, such as allopregnanolone, also potentiate synaptic GABAA receptors, but in addition they enhance extrasynaptic GABAA receptors that mediate tonic inhibition. Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors are not internalized, and desensitization of these receptors does not occur during continuous seizures in status epilepticus models. Here we review the broad-spectrum antiseizure activity of allopregnanolone in animal seizure models and the evidence for its activity in models of status epilepticus. We also demonstrate that allopregnanolone inhibits ongoing behavioral and electrographic seizures in a model of status epilepticus, even when there is benzodiazepine resistance. Parenteral allopregnanolone may provide an improved treatment for refractory status epilepticus.", 
    "155": "Benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus (established status epilepticus, ESE) is a relatively common emergency condition with several widely used treatments. There are no controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trials to compare the efficacy and tolerability of currently available treatments for ESE. The ESE treatment trial is designed to determine the most effective and/or the least effective treatment of ESE among patients older than 2\u00a0years by comparing three arms: fosphenytoin (fPHT) levetiracetam (LVT), and valproic acid (VPA). This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Bayesian adaptive, phase III comparative effectiveness trial. Up to 795 patients will be randomized initially 1:1:1, and response-adaptive randomization will occur after 300 patients have been recruited. Randomization will be stratified by three age groups, 2-18, 19-65, and 66 and older. The primary outcome measure is cessation of clinical seizure activity and improving mental status, without serious adverse effects or further intervention at 60\u00a0min after administration of study drug. Each subject will be followed until discharge or 30\u00a0days from enrollment. This trial will include interim analyses for early success and futility. This trial will be considered a success if the probability that a treatment is the most effective is >0.975 or the probability that a treatment is the least effective is >0.975 for any treatment. Proposed total sample size is 795, which provides 90% power to identify the most effective and/or the least effective treatment when one treatment arm has a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate is 50% in the other two arms.", 
    "156": "Refractory status epilepticus (SE) has a mortality rate of up to 35%. Current treatment protocols for the treatment of SE begin with benzodiazepines and then proceed to conventional anticonvulsants. If seizures continue, SE is considered refractory (RSE) and treatment with anesthetic agents in undertaken. Twenty-four h to 48\u00a0h after initiation of anesthesia with midazolam, pentobarbital or thiopental, or propofol, an attempt is made to wean the anesthetic. If this fails and seizures recur, SE is considered highly refractory (HRSE) and repeated attempts are undertaken. No randomized trial data are available to guide the choice of anesthetic agent in either RSE or HRSE status. Medication resistance in established SE is thought to result, in part, from internalization of synaptic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, making them unavailable for modulation. Neurosteroids act on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, which are not internalized, and are therefore hypothesized to have a role in the treatment of RSE. SGE-102 is a neurosteroid metabolite of progesterone with demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in animal seizure models. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled adjunctive trial of SGE will include subjects randomized at the time that initial treatment with anesthesia is initiated. Subjects will receive midazolam and either SGE-102 or placebo. Midazolam will be tapered and discontinued between hours 24 and 48. SGE-102 or placebo will be continued through hour 120. The primary end point will be the difference in proportion of subjects from each arm who remain seizure free through hour 120. Secondary end points will include the proportion of subjects who are seizure free at hour 168, 2\u00a0days after discontinuation of the experimental agent. The study will be powered to have a 90% chance of detecting a clinically meaningful reduction in seizure recurrence at 120\u00a0h. Comprehensive safety and pharmacokinetic data will also be obtained during the course of the trial.", 
    "157": "Early treatment of prolonged seizures with benzodiazepines given intravenously by paramedics in the prehospital setting had been shown to be associated with improved outcomes, but the comparative efficacy and safety of an intramuscular (IM) route, which is faster and consistently achievable, was previously unknown. RAMPART (the Rapid Anticonvulsant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial) was a double-blind randomized clinical trial to determine if the efficacy of intramuscular (IM) midazolam is noninferior by a margin of 10% to that of intravenous (IV) lorazepam in patients treated by paramedics for status epilepticus (SE). In children and adults with >5\u00a0min of convulsions and who are still seizing at paramedic arrival, midazolam administered by IM autoinjector was noninferior to IV lorazepam on the primary efficacy outcome with comparable safety. Patients treated with IM midazolam were more likely to have stopped seizing at emergency department (ED) arrival, without emergency medical services (EMS) rescue therapy, and were less likely to require any hospitalization or admission to an intensive care unit. Lessons from the RAMPART study's findings and potential implications on clinical practice, on the potential role of other routes of administration, on the effect of timing of interventions, and on future clinical trials are discussed.", 
    "158": "The evolution of the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus since the mid- nineteenth century is outlined. Therapy has been advanced not only by the use of new drugs, but also by advances in the approach to therapy. The major pharmacologic developments were the introductions of bromide, anesthetics, barbiturate, phenytoin, paraldehyde, chlormethiazole, and the benzodiazepines. Throughout this period, the emphasis of therapy was on \"sedation\" and anesthesia, and the development of technologies for safe anesthesia in the postwar years were an important step. Since 1970, changes to the approach to therapy have been more important than any pharmacologic advance, and it is only recently that new drugs have been introduced into the therapy of status epilepticus. We may now be on the threshold of significant new paradigm shifts.", 
    "159": "Status epilepticus (SE) is associated with a dynamic plasticity of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. The plasticity of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated glutamatergic transmission during established SE (ESE), after development of benzodiazepine resistance, was evaluated. There was increased frequency and inward rectification of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents at Schaffer collateral - CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses during ESE. Surface expression of the GluA1 subunit increased, and this was a consequence of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation. Further, diminishing glutamate release by activation of somatostatin receptors prevented SE. These studies suggest that AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission is strengthened during ESE.",

Randomized trials comparing these methods with standard care, which has traditionally involved moderate to heavy sedation, found that both methods reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Additionally, one trial noted that daily sedation interruption paired with spontaneous breathing trials improved 1-year survival, whereas a large observational study found that deep sedation was associated with decreased 180-day survival. Two common characteristics of these interventions in trials showing benefits were avoidance of deep levels of sedation and significant reductions in sedative doses, especially benzodiazepines. Thus, combining targeted light sedation with daily sedation interruption may be more beneficial than either method alone if sedative doses are reduced and arousal and mobility are facilitated during the ICU stay.",

The pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines include 54 evidence-based statements and recommendations. The quality of evidence and strength for each statement and recommendation was ranked. In the absence of sufficient evidence or group consensus, no recommendations were made. An ICU pain, agitation, and delirium care bundle was created to facilitate adoption of the pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines. It focuses on taking an integrated approach to assessing, treating, and preventing pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium in critically ill patients, and it links pain, agitation, and delirium management to spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials, and ICU early mobility and sleep hygiene programs in order to achieve synergistic benefits to ICU patient outcomes.",

    "175": "Allosteric modulation of G protein-coupled receptors has gained considerable attention in the drug discovery arena because it opens avenues to achieve greater selectivity over orthosteric ligands. We recently identified a series of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu(5)) for the treatment of schizophrenia that exhibited robust heterotropic activation of CYP3A4 enzymatic activity. The prototypical compound from this series, 5-(4-fluorobenzyl)-2-((3-fluorophenoxy)methyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrazine (VU0448187), was found to activate CYP3A4 to >100% of its baseline intrinsic midazolam (MDZ) hydroxylase activity in vitro; activation was CYP3A substrate specific and mGlu(5) PAM dependent. Additional studies revealed the concentration-dependence of CYP3A activation by VU0448187 in multispecies hepatic and intestinal microsomes and hepatocytes, as well as a diminished effect observed in the presence of ketoconazole. Kinetic analyses of the effect of VU0448187 on MDZ metabolism in recombinant P450 or human liver microsomes resulted in a significant increase in V(max) (minimal change in K(m)) and required the presence of cytochrome b5. The atypical kinetics translated in vivo, as rats receiving an intraperitoneal administration of VU0448187 prior to MDZ treatment demonstrated a significant increase in circulating 1- and 4-hydroxy- midazolam (1-OH-MDZ, 4-OH-MDZ) levels compared with rats administered MDZ alone. The discovery of a potent substrate-selective activator of rodent CYP3A with an in vitro to in vivo translation serves to illuminate the impact of increasing intrinsic enzymatic activity of hepatic and extrahepatic CYP3A in rodents, and presents the basis to build models capable of framing the clinical relevance of substrate-dependent heterotropic activation.",

The most commonly used tools include the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Since ICU delirium is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, it is imperative that risk factors are identified and prevented. Risk factors include predisposing factors such as history of alcohol abuse, dementia, or hypertension and precipitating factors such as immobilization, oversedation, higher severity of illness, and use of certain psychoactive medications such as benzodiazepines. Pharmacologic treatment with atypical antipsychotics may be used to reduce the duration of delirium if prevention is not successful. However, because of the adverse effects associated with these treatments, close monitoring for side effects is warranted.",

Understanding how to treat these essential entities necessitates fundamental understanding of the pharmacology of sedation, analgesia, and antipsychotics.

Agents used in the management of agitation include drugs that target \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A such as benzodiazepines and propofol and those with other targets such as dexmedetomidine and ketamine. Analgesia in the intensive care unit is controlled primarily using intravenous opioids, which differ on the basis of their potencies and pharmacokinetics. The management of delirium involves preventing its occurrence, removing potential causes, and pharmacotherapy with antipsychotics. Finally, the introduction of paralysis with the use neuromuscular blockers is often necessary in critically ill patients in various situations. In addition to understanding pharmacologic principles associated with the treatment of agitation, pain, and delirium, familiarization with the plethora of assessment tools used to guide therapy in these critically ill patients is mandated.

One of its primary monogenic causes are mutations in Nav1.1 (SCN1A), a voltage-gated sodium channel. Here we characterize zebrafish Nav1.1 (scn1Lab) mutants originally identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen. Mutants exhibit spontaneous abnormal electrographic activity, hyperactivity and convulsive behaviours. Although scn1Lab expression is reduced, microarray analysis is remarkable for the small fraction of differentially expressed genes (~3%) and lack of compensatory expression changes in other scn subunits. Ketogenic diet, diazepam, valproate, potassium bromide and stiripentol attenuate mutant seizure activity; seven other antiepileptic drugs have no effect. A phenotype-based screen of 320 compounds identifies a US Food and Drug Administration-approved compound (clemizole) that inhibits convulsive behaviours and electrographic seizures.

While weight gain associated with AAPs is a risk factor for diabetes, preclinical work suggests that among these medications, olanzapine, when given peripherally in a single dose, causes pronounced effects on insulin sensitivity and secretion. Given a critical role of the hypothalamus in control of glucose metabolism, we examined the effect of central administration of olanzapine. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single 75 \u03bcg intracerebroventricular (ICV) dose of olanzapine and tested using separate hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps. Dosing of olanzapine was established based on inhibition of amphetamine-induced locomotion. In contrast to the single dosing peripheral paradigm, there was no effect of central olanzapine on insulin sensitivity, either with respect to hepatic glucose production or peripheral glucose uptake. Analogous to the peripheral model, a single ICV dose of olanzapine followed by the hyperglycemic clamp decreased insulin (p=0.0041) and C-peptide response (p=0.0039) to glucose challenge as compared to vehicle, mirrored also by a decrease in the steady state glucose infusion rate required to maintain hyperglycemia (p=0.002). In conclusion, we demonstrate novel findings that at least part of the effect of olanzapine on beta-cell function in vivo is central."
