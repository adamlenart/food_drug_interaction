Two different procedures were used for coating silica with the polymer. In the first method, the polymer was deposited onto amino-silica by reaction between its reactive functions and NH2 groups on silica. In the second method, the monomer was first linked to the amino-silica and copolymerization with the excess of monomer initiated thereafter. The enantiomeric properties of the resulting supports after the coupling of HSA were compared using different mobile phases. The higher amount of HSA bound using the later method, resulted in higher retention of the enantiomers and better enantioselectivity.", 
    "1": "Blood toxicology results for deaths attributed to heroin overdose during 1995 in the South Western Sydney (SWS) region (n = 39) were compared with those of a sample of 100 current SWS heroin users who had injected within the preceding 24 h. Heroin-related deaths had a higher median concentration of morphine than current heroin users (0.35 versus 0.09 mg/l). However, there was substantial overlap between the blood morphine concentrations of the two groups, ranging from 0.08-1.45 mg/l. This range incorporated 90% of heroin-related deaths. A third of current users had morphine concentrations over twice the toxic blood morphine concentration employed by the analytical laboratories, and 7% had morphine levels higher than the median recorded for fatal cases. Alcohol was detected in 51% of fatal cases (median = 0.10 g/100 ml) compared with 1% of current heroin user. There was a significant negative correlation among fatal cases between blood morphine and blood alcohol concentrations (r2 = -0.41). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of subjects positive for blood benzodiazepines. The results raise questions about the mechanisms of death in what are termed overdoses, and about the role of alcohol in these fatalities.", 
    "2": "The action of steroids on the bioelectrical response to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has never been studied in pituitary cells. In the present study, we have thus investigated the effects of a series of neuroactive steroids on the GABA-activated current in frog melanotrope cells in primary culture, using the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. Bath perfusion of 3alpha-isomers of pregnanolone or tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (1 microM) significantly enhanced the current evoked by short pulses of GABA (3 microM) and accelerated its desensitization. In contrast, the 3beta-isomers (30 microM) had no effect on the GABA-activated current. Addition to the bath solution of dehydroepiandrosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (10 microM) inhibited the GABA-activated current without modifying its kinetics while pregnenolone sulfate (10 microM) both inhibited the GABA-activated current and accelerated its decay rate. The effects of pregnane steroids were not impaired by the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 microM). In conclusion, the present study reveals that neuroactive steroids may exert multiple modulatory activities on the GABA(A) receptor borne by melanotrope cells. The effect of steroids on the current evoked by GABA is rapid, reversible, stereospecific and not mediated through the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "3": "The expression of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor gene was assayed by a semi-quantitative non-radioactive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The level of amplified mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor mRNA was expressed as a ratio of either glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or beta-actin mRNA co-amplified in the same RT-PCR assay. The relative amounts of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor RNA in several rat tissues were found to be similar to the previously reported relative amount of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor binding sites. The level of these binding sites has also been reported to be altered by stress stimuli. In this study we specifically measured the effect of stress on the mRNA levels of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor as an alternative method to the binding assay in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which stress alters binding. Sprague-Dawley male rats were either forced to swim for 15 min in 18 degrees C water or restrained in a plastic cylinder for 45 min either once, or twice daily for 7 days. Neither the swim stress, nor acute or chronic restraint stress, caused a measurable statistically significant relative change in mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor mRNA in the adrenal gland, kidney, testis and olfactory bulb. However, daily treatment of rats for 7 days with 4 mg/kg of dexamethasone caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor gene expression in adrenal glands. This finding and the measurement of the relative levels of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor mRNA in the various tissues indicate that mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor density is regulated to some extent at the gene expression level. However, the lack of detectable stress-induced changes in mRNA levels for this receptor seem to indicate that either mRNA changes were below detectable levels or that other mechanisms may be involved in the previously reported stress-induced changes of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor density. Because the focus of this work was on the regulation of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor gene expression, ligand binding studies to determine changes in receptor densities were not performed.", 
    "4": "Homophtalazines show specific binding sites in the nigrostriatal system and to find their target of action the interactions between these derivatives, nerisopam and girisopam, and chlorpromazine, chlordiazepoxide and morphine were assessed. The compounds did not influence the chlorpromazine induced decrease in motility and catalepsy, nor did they alter the antiaggressive and anticonvulsive action of chlordiazepoxide. However, nerisopam and girisopam augmented the agonist potency of morphine to induce catalepsy or analgesia; they also altered the opioid antagonist potency of naloxone. The naloxone-induced decrease in sucrose consumption in drinking water was augmented by nerisopam and girisopam. It is suggested that a possible target of action of homophtalazines is the opioid signal transduction.", 
    "5": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is co-localized with dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) where evidence suggests that CCK(B) receptor-mediated mechanisms inhibit, while CCK(A) receptor-mediated mechanisms facilitate, DA function. As DA has been implicated in the acquisition of conditioned activity, the present experiments investigated the effects of CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptor selective antagonists on the acquisition and expression of conditioned activity produced by cocaine. Paired rats received four cocaine-environment pairings whereas Unpaired rats received the two stimuli explicitly unpaired, in that they received cocaine in the home cage. Using this procedure, cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) reliably produced conditioned activity such that the Paired group showed a higher level of locomotion than the Unpaired group on a subsequent drug-free test day. Systemic administration of devazepide, a CCK(A) receptor antagonist, but not L-365,260, a CCK(B) receptor antagonist, blocked the acquisition of conditioned activity. Microinjection of the CCK(A) antagonist PD-140548 into the NAC similarly impaired the acquisition of conditioned activity. However, systemic administration of neither the CCK(A) nor CCK(B) receptor antagonist modified the expression of cocaine-induced conditioned activity once established. These studies suggest that CCK(A), but not CCK(B), receptor mediated mechanisms in the NAC play a key role in the acquisition of conditioned activity.", 
    "6": "The effect of three different M1 muscarinic antagonists, pirenzepine, biperiden, and trihexyphenidyl on memory consolidation was investigated. Rats were trained in a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task and injected intraperitoneally immediately afterwards, either with pirenzepine, biperiden, or trihexyphenidyl (dose range from 0 to 16 mg/kg). The non-selective antimuscarinic compound scopolamine, was also administered for comparison. One day later, rats were tested for retention. Results show that biperiden, trihexyphenidyl and scopolamine produced a dose-dependent impairment of inhibitory avoidance consolidation, while pirenzepine had no effect. The amnestic state produced by biperiden and trihexyphenidyl was comparable to that observed after the administration of scopolamine. These results indicate that the selective blockade of the central M1 muscarinic receptors interfere with memory consolidation of inhibitory avoidance and suggest that this receptor subtype is critically involved in mnemonic functions.", 
    "7": "Intestinal afferents are sensitive to cholecystokinin (CCK) octapeptide. However, CCK-58 may be a more biologically relevant molecule. Therefore, recordings from jejunal mesenteric afferent bundles were secured for extracellular multi-unit recording and the responses to CCK-8 and CCK-58 compared. CCK-8 and CCK-58 (i.v.) evoked a dose-dependent, devazepide sensitive, increase in afferent nerve discharge. Peak discharge frequency was higher for CCK-8 at all doses (P < 0.05). However, response duration was more prolonged for CCK-58 (P < 0.05) at 200 pmol.kg(-1). This resulted in an overall increase in area under the curve of CCK-58 compared to CCK-8 (P < 0.05). CCK-58 stimulates afferent discharge in a different pattern than CCK-8 and, therefore, may have differential biological effects.", 
    "8": "The nature of the neuroprotection by the competitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, 6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX), and the non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-7,8-methy lenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53655), was investigated in mature telencephalic neurone cultures of the rat. NBQX protected cultured neurones against AMPA-induced delayed toxicity in a competitive manner: the AMPA concentration-response curve was shifted to the right in parallel and concentration dependently. In contrast, GYKI 53655 decreased the maximal neurotoxic effect of AMPA considerably but without affecting the EC50, for AMPA toxicity, which indicated the non-competitive mode of its action. Thus we found a clear relationship between the nature of in vitro neuroprotection and the mode of AMPA channel block.", 
    "9": "Nerisopam, an anxiolytic and antipsychotic homophthalazine induces rapid, intense expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the rostral, dorsomedial and lateral parts of the striatum in the rat. Fos-positive cells also occurred in the globus pallidus, the olfactory tubercle and in the accumbens nucleus (in the cone and shell portions) but the substantia nigra, the entopeduncular and the subthalamic nuclei were virtually Fos-negative. 5 h after nerisopam application, however, cells in the reticular zone of the substantia nigra showed Fos-like immunopositivity. After a daily application of nerisopam for two weeks, relatively weak Fos-like immunoreactivity was observed in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus but not in the globus pallidus. Unilateral surgical transection of the striato-nigral pathway, which depleted tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining in the ipsilateral striatum did not influence nerisopam-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity in the striatal neurons, either ipsi- or contralateral to the knife cut. Our results suggest that the striatal neurons are the primary targets of this anxiolytic and antipsychotic drug in the central nervous system.", 
    "10": "Glutamate, the neurotransmitter at most excitatory synapses in the brain, activates a variety of receptor subtypes that can broadly be divided into ionotropic (ligand-gated ion channels) and metabotropic (G-protein-coupled) receptors. Ionotropic receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission, and based on pharmacological and molecular biological studies are divided into NMDA and non-NMDA subtypes. The non-NMDA receptor group is further divided into AMPA and kainate subtypes. Virtually all fast excitatory postsynaptic currents studied so far in the central nervous system are mediated by the AMPA and NMDA subtypes of receptors. Surprisingly, despite extensive analysis of their structure, biophysical properties and anatomical distribution, a synaptic role for kainate receptors in the brain has not been found. Here we report that repetitive activation of the hippocampal mossy fibre pathway, which is associated with high-affinity kainate binding and many of the kainate receptor subtypes, generates a slow excitatory synaptic current with all of the properties expected of a kainate receptor. This activity-dependent synaptic current greatly augments the excitatory drive of CA3 pyramidal cells.", 
    "11": "L-Glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, acts on three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, named after the agonists AMPA, NMDA and kainate. AMPA receptors are known to mediate fast synaptic responses and NMDA receptors to mediate slow synaptic responses at most excitatory synapses in the brain. Kainate receptors are formed from a separate set of genes (GluR5-7, KA-1 and KA-2) and are widely distributed throughout the brain. They are implicated in epileptogenesis and cell death. However, the physiological functions of kainate receptors are not known. The development of 2,3-benzodiazepine antagonists that are selective for AMPA receptors enables kainate receptors to be specifically activated by exogenous ligands, such as kainate. Here we demonstrate that high-frequency stimulation of mossy fibres in rat hippocampal slices, in the presence of the highly selective AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 53655 plus NMDA- and GABA-receptor antagonists, activates an inward current in CA3 neurons that has a pharmacology typical of kainate receptors. The finding that kainate receptors can be activated synaptically adds to the diversity of information transfer at glutamatergic synapses.", 
    "12": "Rats chronically treated with diazepam (2 mg/kg per day, i.p.) for 21 days were tested 96 h after the last injection in both the forced swim test (inescapable stress) and in an active avoidance test (escapable stress). The influence of carbamazepine (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 25 min prior to each behavioral task was investigated. Withdrawn animals showed a reduced time spent in immobility in the forced swim test and an enhanced latency to escape in the active avoidance test. Both behavioral effects were normalized by a single carbamazepine administration. An additional experiment was performed to investigate the effect of a forced swim experience on cortical chloride uptake following GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) stimulation 96 h after diazepam withdrawal, and the influence of a single administration of carbamazepine on these effects. An increased chloride uptake was observed in vehicle-treated rats but not in diazepam-withdrawn animals following the swimming experience. Carbamazepine pretreatment enhanced chloride uptake after diazepam withdrawal but did not modify chloride flux in stressed or unstressed vehicle-treated rats. These results support the hypothesis that diazepam withdrawal affects the ability to develop adaptive responses to stress and that carbamazepine can normalize such an alteration.",

    "19": "Morphine + midazolam and alfentanil + propofol are regimens offering well tolerated and effective sedation for critically ill patients. However, morphine + midazolam is associated with accumulation in these patients, resulting in prolonged recovery characteristics. Alfentanil+propofol, although more expensive, has a shorter elimination half-life, is not associated with accumulation problems and results in a rapid recovery. This study compared sedation quality, patient recovery characteristics and the cost of alfentanil + propofol and morphine + midazolam for sedating critically ill patients in the intensive care setting. 26 patients were randomly allocated to receive sedation with alfentanil + propofol (n = 17) or morphine + midazolam (n = 9). Outcome measures were the times until extubation, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and final hospital discharge. Cost analysis assessed both drug-related costs, including drug acquisition and administration, and non-drug-related costs, including bed occupancy. Age, gender, diagnosis, Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores and sedation quality did not differ significantly between groups. The times to extubation and until patients were fit for transfer from ICU were significantly shorter for patients sedated with alfentanil + propofol than for those sedated with morphine + midazolam. The total costs (at the time of the study Pounds 1 was equivalent to $US1.59) for ICU hospital stay per patient for alfentanil + propofol and morphine + midazolam were 3063 Pounds and 9511 Pounds, respectively, because the shorter recovery characteristics of alfentanil + propofol led to a reduction in ICU stay. Corresponding costss for total hospital stay were 6063 Pounds and 13735 Pounds, respectively. In conclusion, alfentanil + propofol has a better pharmacoeconomic profile than morphine + midazolam for sedating critically ill patients in the ICU setting.", 
    "20": "Although panic disorder has been associated with impaired quality of life (QOL) and financial dependence, no prior study has examined whether a clinical intervention will improve these outcomes. This study examines the effects of clinically titrated doses of clonazepam versus placebo on QOL and work productivity (WP) in patients with panic disorder. QOL and WP were measured in conjunction with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Work Productivity and Impairment questionnaire were used to assess QOL and WP, respectively. Baseline assessments were obtained before randomizing patients to receive clinically titrated doses of clonazepam or placebo. Follow-up assessments were obtained after 6 weeks of therapy with the test drug or at premature termination from the study. Improvement on the SF-36 Mental Health Component Summary scale was more than twice as great with clonazepam than with placebo (P = 0.03). Clonazepam patients improved (P < 0.05) on all five measures of mental health-related QOL, and both measures of physical health-related QOL, and both measures of WP. Placebo patients improved on three of five measures of mental health-related QOL, but on no other measures. Patients with marked improvements on clinical measures of panic disorder severity, especially avoidance and fear of the main phobia, showed the greatest gains on the SF-36 Mental Health Component Summary scale. Clinically titrated doses of clonazepam significantly improved mental health-related QOL and WP in panic disorder patients. Lesser improvements were obtained with placebo.",

Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were divided into three groups: saline-saline (SS), saline-DZP (SD) and DZP-DZP (DD). The SS group always received intraperitoneal (i.p.) saline (SAL) in daily or acute treatments. The SD group received SAL (i.p.) daily during the task acquisition (30 days), DZP (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) 45 min before the acute 5 s and 1 h delay tests, and it also received DZP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 70 days. The DD group received DZP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) daily during 30 days in the task acquisition, DZP (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) 45 min before the acute 5 s and 1 h delay tests and further received DZP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for an additional 70 days. Our results showed that as compared to control (SS group), 8-10 h prior administration of a single daily dose of DZP (10 mg/kg) did not alter the learning and the performance of short- (5 s delay) and long-term (1 h delay) working memory. However, the acute administration of DZP (2.5 mg/kg) impaired the performance of the short delay task (5 s delay) in animals previously exposed (DD group) or not (SD group) to daily DZP treatment. Therefore, the acute administration of an anxiolytic dose of DZP (2.5 mg/kg) produced a significant impairment of short-term working memory, even in animals exposed to daily DZP treatment for a long time.", 
    "22": "Mono or binocular deprivation, during early postnatal development, produces dramatic effects on the anatomy and physiology of the visual system. Here we report that dark exposure induces apoptotic cell death in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of adult rabbit and this may be related to activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA subtypes of glutamate receptors. In situ DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) was observed in the LGN of rabbits exposed to dark for 48 h. Morphological changes were confirmed on hematoxylin-eosin stained brain tissue coronal sections. Systemic treatment with CGP 040116 or MK 801, two NMDA receptor antagonists, and with GYKI 52466, a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, prevented in situ DNA fragmentation and nuclear chromatin marginalization and condensation. In no instance was apoptosis seen in rabbits kept under a normal light-dark cycle.

    "23": "Benzodiazepines, which are widely used clinically for relief of anxiety and for sedation, are thought to enhance synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system by increasing the open probability of chloride channels activated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Here we show that the benzodiazepine diazepam can also increase the conductance of GABAA channels activated by low concentrations of GABA (0.5 or 5 microM) in rat cultured hippocampal neurons. Before exposure to diazepam, chloride channels activated by GABA had conductances of 8 to 53pS. Diazepam caused a concentration-dependent and reversible increase in the conductance of these channels towards a maximum conductance of 70-80 pS and the effect was as great as 7-fold in channels of lowest initial conductance. Increasing the conductance of GABAA channels tonically activated by low ambient concentrations of GABA in the extracellular environment may be an important way in which these drugs depress excitation in the central nervous system. That any drug has such a large effect on single channel conductance has not been reported previously and has implications for models of channel structure and conductance.",

In the INH group the T 1/2 and AUC of diazepam were significantly increased and the CL was significantly decreased. However, cytochrome P-450 content and the pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam were not changed in the RFP + INH group.

Theophylline, 50 mg/kg, i.p., when given before the antiepileptic drugs, failed to reverse their protection.

GPs opinion (72% satisfied: D35; 78% satisfied: D88) is satisfying but patients attitude (at D88: 54% patients desired to be regiven a tranquilizer, 31% patients occasionally had a BZD and 22% formally demanded a prescription of BZD) is more questionable. Despite a high initial level of anxiety under lorazepam (HARS = 21 +/- 10 at D0), after a one-month period of withdrawal (under placebo or hydroxyzine) followed by a 2 month-period without any treatment, 75% patients were totally free of any drug and their level of anxiety was significantly decreased (D88: HARS = 12 +/- 9). Progressive withdrawal appeared preferable if compared to abrupt since the number of drop outs between D28 and D88 was less important and the procedure judged more favourably by the patients. Levels of anxiety significantly decreased in both the groups (progressive and abrupt) but sleep parameters and number of withdrawal symptoms between D7 and D28 were improved only in abrupt withdrawal group (p < 0.0001). Considering hydroxyzine, 2 patients dropped out between D0 and D28 in the group hydroxyzine 25 mg, 6 patients in the group 50 mg and 5 patients in the group placebo. Levels of anxiety (HARS et Zung) were significantly improved in hydroxyzine 50 mg group (p < 0.007) and in hydroxyzine 25 mg group (p < 0.012) but not in placebo group. Withdrawal symptoms (Tyrer) between D0 and D28 were improved only in hydroxyzine 50 mg group and the number of side effects was significantly improved in both the hydroxyzine (25 et 50 mg) groups but not in placebo group. However, no significant difference was found between the 3 groups. Daytime sleepiness is more frequent in hydroxyzine 50 mg group.", 
    "43": "These results proved a significant improvement of anxiety, a decrease of side effects in both the groups treated with hydroxyzine and a reduction of withdrawal symptomatology in hydroxyzine 50 mg group. When a patient is engaged to be withdrawn from of a lorazepam long term treatment, it can therefore be proposed as a support a transient prescription of hydroxyzine 25 mg TAD to markedly anxious patients and of hydroxyzine 50 mg TAD to patients presenting a withdrawal symptomatology.",

Consequently, biological research using these models has been unsuccessful since the nosological categories do not come out from the psychobiological systems underlying personality psychopathology. By contrast, biological research on dimensional models of personality has been more useful. All dimensional models agree on a neurotic-inhibitory dimension and an exploratory dimension of personality but they differ on other primary traits like dependence, emotionality or impulsiveness. However, gathering together all biological data support the existence of five biological axes of personality: a cognitive axis, a mood axis, an anxious-inhibitory axis, an exploratory axis and a action-control axis.",

    "50": "Neurosteroids are potent and specific modulators of the GABAA receptors which regulate the neuronal activity through diverse neurotransmitter mechanisms. In the present study we investigated the effects of concomitant treatment with various neurosteroids on the development of tolerance and recovery from withdrawal anxiety and hyperactivity to chronic benzodiazepines. Long-term treatment of mice with full allosteric modulator (triazolam 0.25 mg/kg/day for 8 days) or selective allosteric modulator (diazepam 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) of GABAA receptor induced tolerance to behavioral sedation on actimeter and anxiolytic effects on plus-maze, and produced a marked withdrawal anxiety and hyperactivity syndrome upon abrupt cessation of treatment, respectively. Concomitant progesterone (10 mg/kg, s.c.), a neurosteroid precursor, of 4'-chlordiazepam (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.), a mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptor (MDR) ligand, prevented the development of tolerance and significantly augmented the recovery from withdrawal-induced anxiety and hyperlocomotion to diazepam. When administered alone for 21 days, neither progesterone nor 4'-chlordiazepam produced any per se effects on actimeter or plus-maze when tested on post-withdrawal days. Coadministration of neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), or pregnenolone sulfate (PS) (2 mg/kg), but not dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (2 mg/kg), abolished the development of tolerance and attenuated withdrawal-induced anxiety and hyperlocomotion due to triazolam, without producing any per se behavioral effects when tested at 1 and 2 days after the last injection. Coadministration of flumazenil (5 mg/kg), progesterone (10 mg/kg), 4'-chlordiazepam (0.25 mg/kg), hydrocortisone (100 mg/kg) or nifedipine (2 mg/kg) also prevented the development of tolerance and suppressed the triazolam withdrawal syndrome. However, pretreatment with PK11195 (2 mg/kg), a MDR partial antagonist, reversed the effects of 4'-chlordiazepam on triazolam tolerance and recovery from chronic triazolam. When injected simultaneously, nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel antagonist, potentiated the progesterone- and 4'-chlordiazepam-induced attenuation of triazolam tolerance and withdrawal behavior. These findings suggest that coadministration of neurosteroids allopregnanolone, pregnenolone sulfate and progesterone, and MDR ligand 4'-chlordiazepam prevents the development of tolerance to benzodiazepines and augments the recovery from chronic benzodiazepines. These results indicate that coadministration of neurosteroids may facilitate discontinuation of benzodiazepines in long-term therapy.",

Among them, there were 94 samples of taking orally chloral hydrate and 110 ones having intravenous injection with diazepam according to doctor's order. The author also compared the effect of sedation and the chi 2 test showed that chloral hydrate and diazepam had similar effect on babies (P > 0.05), while the sedative effect of diazepam on infants and preschool children was superior to that of chloral hydrate on them (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).",

The blood or plasma samples were stored either at 22 degrees C or at 4 degrees C, and were exposed to global natural light irradiation or protected from light. All substances considerably decreased during the time interval studied. Flunitrazepam soon disappeared completely at room temperature (22 degrees C), while diazepam and flurazepam proved to be more stable, but a clear pattern of breakdown could not be established. The data obtained suggest a result from a long-term stored sample to be cautiously interpreted. Further investigation concerning the stability of drugs and the establishment of optimal storage conditions seem necessary.", 
    "53": "A series of CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonists, 2,4-dioxo-1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives with a plane of symmetry, were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for antagonistic activity. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that carbonylmethyl groups at both N-1 and N-5 positions and hydrophilic groups, such as the carboxyl group on the benzene ring attached to the ureido group at the C-3 position, brought about potent affinity and subtype selectivity for CCK-B/gastrin receptors. Several compounds showed excellent in vivo inhibition of gastric acid secretion induced by pentagastrin in anesthetized rats.", 
    "54": "In order to study structure-activity relationships of dual histamine H2 and gastrin receptor antagonists as well as to improve their low oral absorbability, their prototype benzodiazepine gastrin receptor antagonistic moieties were altered to a conformationally flexible noncyclic dipeptide equivalent. This skeletal modification significantly potentiated the binding affinity of hybrid compounds for the histamine H2 receptor, whereas their affinity for the gastrin receptor and receptor selectivity over the CCK-A receptor varied widely with the substituents on the gastrin moiety. Among them, [3-[3-(3-piperidin-1-ylmethylphenoxy)propylcarbamoyl]p ropyl carbamic acid 3-[3-([(3-methoxyphenyl)[(methylphenylcarbamyl)methyl]carbamoyl]me thyl)ureido]benzyl ester (7a) showed the highest dual histamine H2 and gastrin receptor antagonistic activities. It also displayed distinct gastric acid antisecretory activity in vivo for two assays, namely, Schild's rat method by i.d. administration and the rat pylorus ligation method by oral administration. With the latter case, dose-response relationships were observed for the first time, suggesting its substantially improved oral absorbability. However, 7a did not display distinct in vivo gastric acid antisecretory activity for the assay with Heidenhain pouch dogs.", 
    "55": "Three different types of dual histamine H2 and gastrin receptor antagonists, e.g. those bearing a benzazepine, benzoxazepine, or benzothiazepine skeleton instead of the benzodiazepine one as a gastrin receptor antagonistic moiety were synthesized to reduce high hydrophobicity of parent compounds and evaluated for the dual activities. These skeletal modifications significantly potentiated the binding affinity of dual antagonists with histamine H2 receptor but markedly diminished their binding affinity with the gastrin receptor and the gastrin versus CCK-A receptor selectivity. We evaluated in vivo gastric acid antisecretory activities for some representative compounds by the rat pylorus ligation method for 10 mg kg(-1) dose by oral route. However, they exerted only low inhibitory activities for oral dose with % inhibition values ranging between 32 and 53%.", 
    "56": "In order to study structure-activity relationships of the previously reported dual histamine H2 and gastrin receptor antagonists and also to improve their low oral absorbability, we tried two chemical modifications. One tried to decrease the high hydrophobicity of the parent hybrid compounds to an appropriate level by incorporating a hydrophilic group into the molecule and the other by replacing the more hydrophobic groups with less hydrophobic ones. The former compounds (type I) involved hybrid compounds with a hydroxyl group at a position of a spacer, a piperidine moiety of H2A, or a phenyl ring at the C5 of the benzodiazepine skeleton as well as those with a free carboxyl group in the piperidine moiety of H2A. The latter (type II) involved hybrid compounds with the C5-phenyl group replaced with either a methyl group or hydrogen atom. Among them, only a type I compound, ([2-[3-(3-piperidin-1-ylmethylphenoxy)propylcarbamoyl] ethylcarbamoyl]methyl)carbamic acid 3-[3-[5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiaz epin-3-yl]ureido]benzyl ester (18), showed potent dual histamine H2 and gastrin receptor antagonistic activity, whereas others resulted in a significant decrease of histamine H2 receptor antagonistic activity. The in vivo gastric acid antisecretory activity of 18 evaluated by Schild's rat method, however, did not suggest any notable improvement in oral absorbability.", 
    "57": "In experiments on rats with tests for avoidance of an \"illuminated area\" and a \"threatening situation\", microinjection into the septal nucleus accumbens of monoamines and GABA, adreno- and dopaminomimetics, and their antagonists demonstrated a different neurochemical profile of this brain structure in anxiety states of different genesis. Local injections of chlordiazepoxide, pnenibut, indoter, campiron, and campironin into the nucleus weakened the alarm in the test for avoidance of an \"illuminated area\" and/or a \"threatening situation\", showing a similarity to the effects of GABA and serotonin but not to those of mesaton (phenylephrine hydrochloride) and dopamine. It is concluded that the antialarm effect of benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics may be mediated by switching into action of neuron matrices of the accumbens nucleus with a different neurochemical profile responsible for the operative control of behavior in changed modality of the aversive stimulus.",

The displacement curve of 35S-TBPS bound with alprazolam and cinazepam was two-phase in character with different degree of inhibition in the nanomolar and micromolar areas. Hydazepam displaced the bound radioligand only in micromolar concentrations. Displacement of the bound radioligand in the brain membranes began with lower concentrations of the used benzodiazepins in Balb/c animals than in C57B1/6 animals. The emotional-stress effect led to shift of the displacement curves of the bound 35S-TBPS in the direction of higher acting concentrations of the benzodiazepins in the brain membranes of mice of both lines.", 
    "59": "The effect of placebo and gidazepam on the state, psychophysiological predictors of the quality of the operator's performance and its results in individuals with neurotic reactions was studied (test dose 20 mg 7-day course, 40 mg daily, 24 individuals), as well as the effect of gidazepam and phenazepam (42 individuals with neurotic and neurosis-like states; gidazepam test doses 20 and 50 mg, 14-day course, 40 and 100 mg daily; phenazepam test doses 0.5 and 1 mg, 14-day course, daily dose 2 mg). The generally accepted methods of clinical and psychophysiological examination were applied. Gidazepam in the doses under study did not yield to phenazepam in therapeutic activity. A single and a course administration of gidazepam improved the parameters of the psychophysiological state and the efficacy of the operator performance in patients with neurotic reactions and in those with neurotic and neurosis-like states. This makes it possible, whenever necessary, to recommend this drug for the treatment of the indicated disorders in the working operators.", 
    "60": "The integration of pharmacological therapies for comorbid disorders requires an acceptance of independence and interactions of respective addictive and psychiatric disorders. At the same time, alcohol and other drugs induce psychiatric states that are indistinguishable from psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, while psychiatric disorders do not induce addictive use of alcohol and drugs, they do pose vulnerabilities to the development of addictive disorders. Generally, the treatment of comorbid disorders begins with abstinence and evaluation of the effects of alcohol and other drugs in contributing to the psychiatric picture. In the case of comorbid disorders, stabilization and standard treatments can be employed with certain cautions, namely, to avoid the use of addicting medications such as benzodiazepines and opiates beyond the detoxification stage. High potency neuroleptics and antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be used to treat continuing psychiatric states after the exclusionary criteria in DSM-IV for substance-related disorders have been applied to the clinical case. If the psychiatric symptoms clear with sustained abstinence, little or no medications may be required. Specific treatment of the addictive disorders will often determine the extent that addictive disorders are responsible for psychiatric symptomatology. Alternatively, treatment of the psychiatric disorder will enhance compliance with addiction treatment.", 
    "61": "Approximately 10% of the unselected population are affected with personality disorders, among the patients of psychiatrists and family doctors the quota goes up to 40%. Personality disorders comprise deeply ingrained and enduring behaviour patterns, manifesting themselves as inflexible responses to a broad range of personal and social situations. They are stable and lead frequently to subjective distress and/or to impaired social functioning. The division in subgroups is made on the reason of typical patterns of experience and behaviour, but overlapping between different subtypes is frequent. People with personality disorders often come into conflicts with their environment because of their maladaptive behaviour which lead to crises and need of intervention. Psychopharmaca can be given in such situations, but substances with an addictive potential like benzodiazepines should not be prescribed for a longer period. The long-term psychotherapy of personality disordered persons requires an individual planing after a careful analysis of the behaviour pattern and should focus on concretely defined and reachable aims. Personality disordered persons belong to the most difficult patients, their long-term treatment demands appropriate therapeutic skills. In the primary care family doctors therapy and support is important but several basic rules should be followed.",

A phobia is characterized by a strong, irrational fear of a given object or situation, often resulting in avoidance behavior. Phobic patients usually respond well to cognitive behavioral therapy. Panic disorder, which is distinguished by recurring, unexpected attacks of fear not bound to particular situations, may also be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy and/or with clomipramin, benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the main symptom of which is a persistent, free-floating fear over a period of at least several months, may be helped through relaxation techniques, counseling and/or medication with low doses of sedating tricyclic compounds or short-term treatment with benzodiazepines. This article will describe anamnestic findings and the results of clinical examinations of patients with anxiety disorders. Factors to be considered in differential diagnosis will be discussed.",

    "65": "Sleep loss and increased sleepiness on the job are among the most prevalent problems encountered by people involved in night shift work, especially in cases of abrupt shift of the wake-sleep cycle. In such conditions, detrimental effects on performance are well documented. In these situations, to avoid decrements of performance at night, one possibility is to use hypnotics for improving the quality and quantity of daytime sleep. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 20 mg of temazepam on daytime sleep, the subsequent levels of nocturnal alertness/sleepiness, and performance in a laboratory simulation of acute night shift. For evaluating alertness, sleepiness, and performance we used, respectively, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and two pencil and paper tests: digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and deux barrages test (DBT). All tests were administered four times at 2-hour intervals during the nighttime after daytime sleep. Results showed that the ability to maintain wakefulness (MWT) and to perform some visuo-attentive tasks were substantially maintained during the night. On the other hand, sleep tendency (MSLT) linearly increased during the night. Temazepam resulted in being an effective diurnal hypnotic, increasing total sleep time with no residual detrimental effects on sleepiness and performance and with an increase in the ability to stay awake.", 
    "66": "A 14-month-old girl had experienced sudden episodes of breath-holding and spasms of the trunk and limb muscles, leading to cyanosis and loss of consciousness since 3 months of age. Her clinical features and electromyography suggested Stiffman syndrome, and her response to high-dose diazepam and baclofen confirmed the diagnosis. Stiffman syndrome is a rare entity, rarer still in childhood. This is the youngest case of sporadic Stiffman syndrome reported in literature. Distinguishing Stiffman syndrome from similar conditions such as Schwartz-Jampel syndrome or neuromyotonia is important because administration of GABAergic agents (valproate, baclofen, diazepam) elicits a good response.", 
    "67": "We have studied midlatency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) and motor signs of wakefulness during anaesthesia with midazolam in 10 patients undergoing elective laparotomy under continuous extradural analgesia. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.3 mg kg-1 and maintained with midazolam 0.3-0.9 mg kg-1 h-1. Motor signs of wakefulness were documented as spontaneous movements and movements after simple commands (open eyes or move arms). MLAEP were recorded continuously awake, and during anaesthesia until the end of anaesthesia. Latencies of the peaks V, Na, Pa, Nb and P1 (ms) and amplitudes of the peaks Na/Pa, Pa/Nb and Nb/P1 (microV) were measured. Twenty-five movements were observed during anaesthesia; 15 movements in six patients were in response to commands. In two patients supplementary isoflurane was given. Latencies of the MLAEP peaks Pa, Nb and P1 increased slightly during anaesthesia. Amplitudes for Na/Pa, Pa/Nb and Nb/P1 did not change significantly. The high incidence of motor signs of wakefulness associated with preserved MLAEP indicated a high level of cortical neural activity and none of the MLAEP variables predicted movement during anaesthesia with midazolam.",

YM022 exhibited high affinity and selectivity for the CCK-B receptor subtype as estimated from [125I]CCK8S displacement studies using membranes derived from hCCK-B.CHO and hCCK-A.CHO cells. Functional antagonist activity of YM022 was demonstrated employing CCK-4-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in hCCK-B.CHO cells. In the presence of 30 nM YM022, the maximum effect of CCK-4 was suppressed to 48 +/- 11% of control, an effect that was accompanied by a modest rightward shift in the CCK-4 concentration-response curve. In contrast, the structurally similar CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260 [3R(+)-N-[2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin -3-yl]-N'-(methylphenyl)urea; 30 nM-10 microM] produced progressive rightward shifts in the CCK-4 concentration-response curve, with no effect observed on the CCK-4 maximum response. Further characterization using the technique of microphysiometry revealed that the agonist activity of CCK-4 was not restored following washout after exposure to YM022. The antagonist activity of L-365,260, however, was found to be fully reversible in this system. Thus, YM022 behaves as an irreversible antagonist, whilst its structural analogue L-365,260 exhibits properties consistent with a competitive antagonist.",

The aetiology is unknown, although it is associated with certain auto-immune disorders, particularly diabetes mellitus (DM) and others such as thyroid disease, vitiligo, pernicious anaemia, adrenal insufficiency, etc. The presence of high titres of glutamate-decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies seems to indicate an auto-immune aetiology.",

Also there was generalized vitiligo and whilst this progressed, DM developed (which finally required insulin to control it).

There were no differences in their current ages but the age of onset of the headaches varied (p = 0.000,t). Unilateral pain, trigger factors and a family history were more frequent in the cases of transformed migraine. Eighty four patients (75%) abused analgesics.

    "77": "Prior research has demonstrated that diazepam decreases hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortex (HPA) axis activity in stressful contexts but, paradoxically, acts as a stimulator of basal axis activity. Also, several investigators have reported that low doses of diazepam are not effective in reducing stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) levels, yet similar doses typically produce anxiolytic effects on behavioral measures of fear and anxiety. We have examined the effects of diazepam on plasma CORT levels in male Sprague-Dawley rats utilizing a repeated restraint paradigm. Consistent with most literature, diazepam administered IP (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg) 1 h prior to restraint increased non-stress, baseline plasma CORT levels in a dose-dependent fashion. During the first exposure to the 1 h restraint-stress procedure, CORT levels of diazepam-injected rats did not differ from the stress levels of controls except at the 60-min stress time point in those subjects receiving 6.0 mg/kg. However, diazepam at all three doses was able to attenuate the stress-induced increase in CORT following 5 days of diazepam+restraint treatment. Using the 3.0 mg/kg dose as a probe, it was found that this effect was not dependent on the repeated administration of diazepam, but rather on repeated exposure to restraint. These results suggest that repeated restraint produces a change in neural sensitivity to benzodiazepines.",

    "79": "The Stages of Change Scale (SOC: McConnaughy, Prochaska, & Velicer, 1983) was used to predict outcome among 131 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder who were enrolled in a clinical drug trial. As predicted, subjects high on Precontemplation did not experience as much relief from anxiety as subjects low on Precontemplation, whereas subjects high on Contemplation or Action experienced more decrease in anxiety during the trial than subjects low on these stages. Contrary to our hypothesis, only Contemplation was related to illness severity changes, and scores on the Maintenance scale were not related to outcome. Of the four stage scores, only Maintenance was related to premature termination of treatment. There were no differences between drug (adinazolam) and placebo groups and only Action scores interacted with drug/placebo assignment in this study. Results suggest that the SOC may be useful in identifying individuals who are most likely to experience decreased anxiety while enrolled in a clinical drug trial.", 
    "80": "This investigation examined receptor subtype specificity and possible modulation by GABAa receptor ligands of NPY-induced behavioral responses to stressful stimuli. First, a series of NPY receptor agonists were examined for their potential effects on punished responding in a conflict test modified for incremental shock. NPY, peptide YY (PYY) and NPY Y1 receptor agonists [Leu31,Pro34]-NPY and [Gly6, Glu26,Lys26,Pro34]-NPY produced increases in punished responding in the conflict test. No significant effects on unpunished responding were noted. The pattern of responding was similar to that observed with the benzodiazepine agonist chlordiazepoxide. Neither pancreatic peptide (PP) nor the Y2 agonists NPY13-36 or [Glu2,32,Ala6,Dpr27,Lys28]-NPY significantly altered punished or unpunished responding. Of significance, the atypical Y1 agonist [Cys7,21,Pro34]-NPY produced negligible effects on punished responding, consistent with the presence of a subclass of Y1 receptors. Second, the anxiolytic effects of NPY were subjected to treatments that block actions at the GABAa receptor complex. The increase in punished responding produced by NPY was not altered by administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil and only partially blocked by the picrotoxinin receptor ligand isopropylbicyclophosphate (10 and 15 microg/kg). These findings further support the hypothesis that the pharmacologic substrates for the anxiolytic-like actions of NPY may be mediated by the Y1 receptor subtype and suggest that these actions are independent of either the benzodiazepine or picrotoxinin binding sites of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.",

Fifty patients (36 men, 14 women, mean age 55 +/- 18 years) undergoing diagnostic cardiac electrophysiologic studies were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a consent that did not detail specific risks regarding the procedure (consent A) or one that detailed the risks (consent B). The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was administered before obtaining consent (state 1), immediately after the consent protocol (state 2), and after the electrophysiologic testing procedure, when the results of the test were known to the patient (state 3). Midazolam was administered during the procedure by staff who were blinded to the state/trait anxiety scores and the type of consent the patient had received. Patients receiving consent A had a significant decrease in state 2 anxiety compared with those who received consent B (adjusted mean difference 3.3; 95% confidence intervals 0.2 to 6.4). In the consent A group, 74% of patients received midazolam as opposed to 96% in the consent B group (p <0.02). Patients without inducible ventricular arrhythmias had a significant decrease in state 3 anxiety compared with those with inducible ventricular arrhythmias (adjusted mean difference 8.9; 95% confidence intervals 2.3 to 15.5). Thus detailed informed consent is associated with increased anxiety relative to a consent that does not detail specific risks. However, the difference in anxiety is mild and its clinical impact requires further exploration.", 
    "82": "The ability of naloxone to block the effects of the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and diazepam was evaluated in Swiss and Balb/c mice subjected to the light/dark choice test of anxiety or to a choice paradigm for measuring spontaneous exploratory behaviour. In Swiss mice, naloxone (5 or 10 mg/kg) completely or partially suppressed the anxiolytic-like effects of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg) in the light/dark test. Naloxone alone was ineffective. None of these compounds affected locomotion in the free exploratory test. In Balb/c mice, naloxone did not reduce the anxiolytic-like action of benzodiazepines in the light/dark test. Moreover, naloxone did not antagonize the decrease in neophobia observed after anxiolytic treatment in Balb/c mice in the free exploratory paradigm. In this strain, benzodiazepines produced an increase of locomotor activity, whereas naloxone decreased it. The stimulant effects of benzodiazepines on locomotor activity were abolished by naloxone. As naloxone (2 mg/kg) reversed the morphine-induced hyperthermia both in Swiss and in Balb/c mice, differences in possible pharmacokinetic factors between the two strains can be ruled out as an explanation for the failure of naloxone to antagonize anxiolytic-like effects in Balb/c mice. Therefore, the ability of naloxone to reverse anxiolytic effects does not hold for all strains of mice.", 
    "83": "Transgenic mice with impaired type II-glucocorticoid receptor mediated feedback inhibition of hypthalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity were assessed in three different tests assessing behavioral reactivity to aversive stimuli, the elevated plus maze, the Thatcher-Britton novelty-conflict paradigm, and the startle paradigm. Transgenic mice more frequently entered and spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus in comparison to B6C/3F1 mice. Transgenic mice took significantly longer to begin eating in the Thatcher-Britton novelty conflict paradigm, and displayed increased reactivity in the startle paradigm. Administration of 1 or 2 mg/kg diazepam reversed the behavioral effects observed in all three tests. Administration of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist N-methyl-beta-carboline-3 carboxamide (FG-7142, 10 mg/kg) reduced the ratio of open to total arm entries and the time spent in the open arms of the plus maze in transgenic, but not B6C/3F1, mice. This dose of FG-7142 did not influence performance of either strain in the Thatcher-Britton or startle paradigms. These results are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that the transgenic mice are more sensitive to the aversive properties of novel stimuli, and that they may have difficulty discriminating between signals of relative safety and danger.", 
    "84": "Gastrin controls the histamine- and chromogranin A-producing enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, the predominant endocrine cell population in the acid-producing part of the rat stomach. They are responsible for most of the circulating pancreastatin, a chromogranin A-derived peptide. The present study examines the ability of two potent and highly selective cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor antagonists, RP73870 and YM022, to incapacitate the ECL cells. The two antagonists were given by continuous subcutaneous infusion to otherwise untreated rats and to hypergastrinaemic rats treated with gastrin-17 (continuous subcutaneous infusion) or omeprazole (orally) for 7 days. Several parameters reflecting ECL cell activity were measured: The oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity, the histamine concentration, the histidine decarboxylase mRNA and chromogranin A mRNA concentrations, and the serum pancreastatin concentration. In addition, the serum gastrin concentration was measured. RP73870 and YM022 greatly lowered the oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity and the histidine decarboxylase mRNA and chromogranin A mRNA concentrations, and also reduced the oxyntic mucosal histamine concentration and the serum pancreastatin concentration. Moreover, they raised the serum gastrin concentration. With respect to blockade of histidine decarboxylase activity, 1.0 mumol.kg-1.hr-1 was an almost maximally effective dose for both RP73870 and YM022. The corresponding ID50 values were 0.04 and 0.05 mumol.kg-1.hr-1. RP73870 and YM022 inhibited the hypergastrinaemia-evoked rise in all ECL-cell parameters. The results suggest that sustained cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor blockade causes lasting deactivation of the ECL cells.", 
    "85": "Critical care clinicians frequently manage patient pain and agitation and promote ventilator stability through use of opioids and benzodiazepines. Often, doses of these drugs must be increased considerably over time as they lose their effectiveness-an indication of drug tolerance. Furthermore, patients can experience negative physiologic responses to withdrawal of these drugs-an indication of drug dependence. Withdrawal symptoms due to abrupt discontinuation of drug therapy can be profound and dangerous. It is important that clinicians understand the mechanisms of drug therapies and their potential negative sequelae. The purpose of this article is to present physiologic theories of opioid and benzodiazepine actions, as well as drug tolerance and dependence, as a basis of knowledge for clinical practice. A clinical scenario of an intensive care unit patient is presented, and a care plan is offered, to provide guidance to practitioners who care for patients experiencing the consequences of long-term opioid and benzodiazepine use.", 
    "86": "The authors examined characteristics of successful completers of an outpatient clonidine/oxazepam detoxification procedure for opioid dependence. Of 215 initial applicants, 167 received medication, and 65 successfully completed by taking a dose of naltrexone. Those who completed were more likely to have last used an opioid other than heroin, to be heroin smokers, rather than intravenous users, to have used benzodiazepines in the 30 days before treatment, and to have abstained from opioids for a longer time before presenting for treatment. New users (for less than 2 years) did no better than those using longer than 2 years. These findings may help in the continued refinement of patient placement criteria.", 
    "87": "Acetylcholine acting via muscarinic receptors located in the intestinal mucosa controls ion and fluid transport. This study examined the pathway(s) by which cholinergic receptors mediate secretion in rat isolated duodenum, jejunum and ileum using the short-circuit current (Isc) as an index of electrogenic CL- secretion. Carbachol and bethanechol induced electrogenic CL- transport which was insensitive to the neural blocker tetrodotoxin, indicating their direct action on the enterocytes. Functional characterization of electrogenic secretion activated via muscarinic receptors on jejunal and ileal enterocytes was achieved by use of selective muscarinic antagonists in the presence of tetrodotoxin. In both regions the rank order of potency of these compounds (atropine > 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) > hexahydro-sila-difenidol (HHSiD) > pirenzepine > methoctramine) indicated the M3 receptor subtype. Secretion activated by the muscarinic agonist 4-[[(3-chlorophenyl)amino]carbonyl]-N,N, N-trimethyl-2-butyn-1-ammonium chloride (McN-A-343) was sensitive to tetrodotoxin and pirenzepine but not to the ganglionic blocker, hexamethonium, indicating the M1 receptor subtype on post ganglionic neurons. Regional differences for bethanechol-activated secretion showed an increasing gradient in secretory capacity (Isc max) in a proximal-to-distal direction along the small intestine. Responses to McN-A-343 also showed regional differences but these were unlike those of bethanechol. These results show that cholinomimetic-induced electrogenic CL- secretion in rat isolated small intestine appears to be mediated by two dissimilar populations of muscarinic receptor: M3 muscarinic receptors positioned on enterocytes and M1 muscarinic receptors sited on submucosal neurons.", 
    "88": "Potential adverse outcomes (falls, impaired cognition, impaired self-care) of psychotropic (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics) and narcotic medication use were examined in a large sample of Canadians 65 years of age and older. We examined rates of reported falls, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) scores, and mean number of self-care impairments for those consuming psychotropic and/or narcotic drugs as compared to non-users. Use of psychotropic drugs and/or narcotics was associated with an increased prevalence of falls, lower DSST scores, and/or number of self-care difficulties. For example, in subjects who were cognitively normal, the frequency of falls was 60% greater in benzodiazepine users and 120% greater in users of antidepressants as compared to non-users. Adverse outcomes increased with the number of classes of psychotropic or narcotic medications used. These effects were most pronounced in cognitively normal subjects where the prevalence of falls increased from 13.9% in those consuming none of the medication classes to 42.6% for users of two or more classes. In subjects with mild dementia the use of these medications was not associated with any significant differences in the outcomes measured. Regression models showed that benzodiazepine, antidepressant, and narcotic use remained significant explanatory variables for potential adverse outcomes even after simultaneously considering the effects of several other variables. Although further work is necessary, our results suggest that individuals with better cognitive function may be at particular risk for adverse effects with use of these medications.", 
    "89": "Ras proteins have been implicated in transducing cellular responses to DNA damaging agents. We used BZA-5B, an inhibitor of Ras-farnesylation, to examine the role of Ras in cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. A human melanoma cell line (224) with a Gln61Arg mutation in N-ras was used for these studies. We report that BZA-5B treated cells show an increased resistance to cisplatin. BZA-5B treatment decreased the number of cells showing in situ DNA fragmentation and increased cell viability and clonogenic survival after cisplatin treatment. Further experiments showed that cisplatin induction of the immediate early genes c-jun and p21cip1 was not affected by BZA-5B. Finally, we show that cisplatin causes only weak activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a human melanoma cell line. We conclude that inhibition of Ras function decreases the sensitivity of human melanoma cells to cisplatin-induced cell death.", 
    "90": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether, in indo 1 acetoxymethyl ester (AM)-loaded rat cardiomyocytes, it was possible to remove cytosolic but not mitochondrial indo 1 by promoting loss of cytosolic indo 1 through plasma membrane anion pumps (which are blocked by probenecid). Isolated rat ventricular myocytes were loaded with indo 1-AM under conditions (15 min at 30 degrees C) in which about half of the dye is located within mitochondria. Cells were then maintained at 25 degrees C for 2.5 h followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 1.5 h. After this \"heat treatment,\" the myocyte fluorescence signal was 44% of the value of cells measured before heat treatment, and loss of fluorescence was prevented by 1 mM probenecid. The remaining fluorescence was shown to originate from mitochondria, since 1) Ca2+ uptake and efflux could be inhibited by ruthenium red and clonazepam, respectively, and 2) low concentrations of digitonin, which release only cytosolic marker enzymes, decreased fluorescence of untreated myocytes but had little effect on the fluorescence signal of heat-treated cells. We conclude that heat treatment selectively removes cytosolic indo 1, leaving a signal due to mitochondrial indo 1 only.",

Patients undergoing such procedures usually receive general anesthesia or deep sedation administered by an anesthesiologist. In 536 consecutive procedures performed in the EP lab, we assessed the safety and efficacy of deep sedation administered under the direction of an electrophysiologist and in the absence of an anesthetist. Patients were monitored with pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure recordings, and continuous ECGs. The level of consciousness and vital signs were evaluated at 5-minute intervals. Deep sedation was induced in 260 patients using midazolam, phenergan, and meperidine, then maintained with intermittent dosing of meperidine at the following mean doses: midazolam 0.031 +/- 0.024 mg/kg; phenergan 0.314 +/- 0.179 mg/kg; and meperidine 0.391 +/- 0.167 mg/kg per hour. In the remaining 276 patients, deep sedation was induced with midazolam and fentanyl and maintained with a continuous infusion of fentanyl at a mean dose of 2.054 +/- 1.43 micrograms/kg per hour. Fourteen patients experienced a transient reduction in oxygen saturation that was readily reversed following administration of naloxone. An additional 11 patients desaturated secondary to partial airway obstruction, which resolved after repositioning the head and neck. Fourteen patients experienced hypotension with fentanyl.

    "100": "1. The mechanisms underlying the midazolam-induced relaxation of the noradrenaline (NA)-contraction were studied by measuring membrane potential, isometric force and intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in endothelium-denuded muscle strips from the rabbit mesenteric resistance artery. The actions of midazolam were compared with those of nicardipine, an L-type Ca2+-channel blocker. 2. Midazolam (30 and 100 microM) did not modify either the resting membrane potential or the membrane depolarization induced by 10 microM NA. 3. NA (10 microM) produced a phasic, followed by a tonic increase in both [Ca2+]i and force. Midazolam (10-100 microM) did not modify the resting [Ca2+]i, but attenuated the NA-induced phasic and tonic increases in [Ca2+]i and force, in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, nicardipine (0.3 microM) attenuated the NA-induced tonic, but not phasic, increases in [Ca2+]i and force. 4. In Ca2+-free solution containing 2 mM EGTA, NA (10 microM) transiently increased [Ca2+]i and force. Midazolam (10-100 microM), but not nicardipine (0.3 microM), attenuated this NA-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and force, in a concentration-dependent manner. However, midazolam (10 and 30 microM), had no effect on the increases in [Ca2+]i and force induced by 10 mM caffeine. 5. In ryanodine-treated strips, which have functionally lost the NA-sensitive Ca2+ storage sites, NA slowly increased [Ca2+]i and force. Nicardipine (0.3 microM) did not modify the resting [Ca2+]i but partly attenuated the NA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and force. In the presence of nicardipine, midazolam (100 microM) lowered the resting [Ca2+]i and further attenuated the remaining NA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and force. 6. The [Ca2+]i-force relationship was obtained in ryanodine-treated strips by the application of ascending concentrations of Ca2+ (0.16-2.6 mM) in Ca2+-free solution containing 100 mM K+. NA (10 microM) shifted the [Ca2+]i-force relationship to the left and enhanced the maximum Ca2+-induced force. Under these conditions, whether in the presence or absence of 10 microM NA, midazolam (10 and 30 microM) attenuated the increases in [Ca2+]i and force induced by Ca2+ without changing the [Ca2+]i-force relationship. 7. It was concluded that, in smooth muscle of the rabbit mesenteric resistance artery, midazolam inhibits the NA-induced contraction through its inhibitory action on NA-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Midazolam attenuates NA-induced Ca2+ influx via its inhibition of both nicardipine-sensitive and -insensitive pathways. Furthermore, midazolam attenuates the NA-induced release of Ca2+ from the storage sites. This effect contributes to the midazolam-induced inhibition of the NA-induced phasic contraction.",

The dose were 0.4 mg/kg for diazepam and 250 mg (for children younger than 3 years old) or 500 mg (for over 3 years old) for chloral hydrate. Another dose was given after an interval of 8 hours if body temperature continued to exceed 38.0 degrees C. Among the 452 patients with febrile seizures who visited our hospital from Jan. 1993 to Jun. 1995, 113 were studied who had at least one febrile episode in the follow-up period that extended over 6 months. These patients were divided into two groups: Group D (72 patients given diazepam) and Group C (41 patients given chloral hydrate). In group D and C, the numbers of febrile episodes were 238 and 167, and those of recurrent seizures 8 (3.8%) and 29 (20.4%), respectively. The recurrences rate was significantly higher in the latter group (p < 0.005). There was no statistical difference as to the mean dosage of diazepam or chloral hydrate between the patients with and without recurrence. The numbers of patients with seizure recurrence were 8 (11.1%) in group D and 12 (29.3%) in group C, being significantly larger in the latter (p < 0.005). Diazepam produced more adverse effects than chloral hydrate did. Thus diazepam suppositories for the prevention of recurrence of febrile seizures were more effective than chloral hydrate suppositories.",

Whilst jaw relaxation and ease of laryngeal mask insertion were similar between the two groups, patients receiving propofol were less likely to have undesired responses requiring additional boluses of induction agent (p < 0.05).

    "115": "Four rats responded under a simple fixed consecutive number schedule in which eight or more consecutive responses on the run lever, followed by a single response on the reinforcement lever, produced the food reinforcer. Under this simple schedule, dose-response curves were determined for diazepam, morphine, pentobarbital, and phencyclidine. The rats were then trained to respond under a multiple fixed consecutive number schedule in which a discriminative stimulus signaled when the response requirement on the run lever had been completed in one of the two fixed consecutive number component schedules. Under control conditions, the percentage of reinforced runs under the multiple-schedule component with the discriminative stimulus added was much higher than the percentage of reinforced runs under the multiple-schedule component without the discriminative stimulus. All of the drugs decreased the percentage of reinforced runs under each of the fixed consecutive number schedules by increasing the conditional probability of short run lengths. This effect was most consistently produced by morphine. The drugs produced few differences in responding between the multiple fixed consecutive number components. Responding under the simple fixed consecutive number schedule, however, was affected at lower doses of the drugs than was responding under the same fixed consecutive number schedule when it was a component of the multiple schedule. This result may be due to the difference in schedule context or, perhaps, to the order of the experiments.", 
    "116": "This article deals with the further systematic investigation of the effects of diazepam on quantitative beta activity in EEG background activity, and the determination of the affecting factors concerned. Diazepam (0.1-0.03 mg/kg) was injected intravenously, the percentage of diazepam-induced changes in beta activity (PDICB) over the 8 sites of scalp EEG recordings was quantitatively analyzed using spectral analysis. The affecting factors concerned were also explored by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis in 84 cases of epilepsy. The results showed that the mean PDICB value in epileptic patients (4.49 +/- 4.51) was significantly lower than that in normal controls (8.03 +/- 5.55). In patients with slowing of EEG background pre-diazepam, AED treatment, long duration of receiving AEDs, refractory epilepsy and brain structural damage, the PDICB value was statistically significantly reduced. The mean PDICB values were lower in the patients with CPS, GTCS, etiologic factors, or paroxysmal discharges on the pre-drug EEG recordings, and the PDICB tended toward decrease with advancing disease duration and seizure frequency; however, these trends did not reach statistical significance. Besides the PDICB values also did not statistically correlate with sex, age and age at seizure onset. In multi-variate analysis with a stepwise regression model, it was found that slowing of EEG background and AED treatment were independently and negatively associated with the decreased PDICB. These results suggest that a reduction of beta activity induced by diazepam, which may involve the whole brain besides the epileptogenic lesion, is significantly related not only to cerebral function impairment of structural changes due to the epileptic process, but also to AED interactions or synergistic effects.",

Nineteen patients undergoing 24 INR procedures received propofol PCS (PCS dose, 0.5 mg/kg; lockout interval, 3 min) or anesthesiologist-administered midazolam-fentanyl sedation. Study parameters included discomfort, sedation and anxiety visual analogue scores (VAS), cognitive function, patient satisfaction, and complications. No difference was found between the two sedation techniques with respect to the levels of sedation and anxiolysis. Cognitive function was well preserved in both groups. Patient satisfaction was similarly high in both groups. Complications were similar between groups. These included ventilatory depression (two patients in each group) and excessive sedation (two patients in each group). Three patients in the propofol group became excessively restless, resulting in brief interruptions during the respective procedures. Propofol PCS offers a safe sedation technique during INR procedures with a sedation and anxiolysis profile that was not distinguishable from anesthesiologist-administered midazolam-fentanyl sedation.", 
    "119": "Employing the active benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands, we have used BOLD fMRI to elucidate the effects of these drugs on brain function. The sequential MRI was performed with a 1.5T clinical scanner (Philips GYROSCAN) using a FLASH sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE, 100/45 msec; flip angle, 25 degrees; matrix size, 128*128; 2 averages; for 64 image acquisitions in 32 min. First, 2 mg of diazepam was administrated intravenously at the beginning of the 5th, 15th, 25th, and 35th acquisitions. Then, flumazenil was administrated at the beginning of the 45th (0.2 mg) and 55th (0.3 mg) acquisitions in order to reverse the effect of diazepam. Data processing was made employing Akaike Information Criterion to detect if there were intensity changes after the medication among the trends of intensity changes. Diazepam administration decreased the intensity for a while and flumazenil increased one. In the case of the left frontal glioma with focal epileptogenicity, intensity changes were detected around the tumor. Since the neuronal function consists of the trans-neuronal communications employing neurotransmitters, the result on the modulation of this passage depends on the neuronal function related to the transmitter: gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in this instance for the effects of these medications to epilepsy. The change in the local blood flow is the result of the local neuronal activity. Therefore, we speculate that this neuropharmacological functional MR image may reflect the neuronal function related to the GABAegic neurotransmitter system. In addition to elucidating basic neurotransmitter function mechanisms, we believe this technique may have clinical utility in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with intractable seizure disorders. In this respect, this paper presents a new spectrum of fMRI that is capable to study a part of neurotransmitter function employing the BZR ligands, reversing the effect of the agonist with the competitive antagonist, for the first experience, to propose the neuropharmacological functional MR images to have clinical utility in patients with intractable epilepsy in the interictal state.",

The time for complete drug dissolution was studied in the sublingual group by the inspection of tablet residue under the tongue every five minutes for 20 min, then the patients were interviewed regarding their acceptance of taste.", 
    "122": "The sedation scores in the sublingual group were higher than in the oral group at 30 and 60 min after drug administration. (P = 0.0054 and P = 0.008) Seventy-two percent of the sublingual group had complete drug dissolution within 10 min and 64% of the patients in the sublingual group found the tablet acceptable with regard to its taste.", 
    "123": "Midazolam 7.5 mg sublingual is a more effective pre-anaesthetic sedative than by the oral route.", 
    "124": "This study was designed to define the appropriate dose of remifentanil hydrochloride alone or combined with midazolam to provide satisfactory comfort and maintain adequate respiration for a monitored anesthesia care setting.", 
    "125": "One hundred fifty-nine patients scheduled for outpatient surgery participated in this multicenter, double-blind study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: remifentanil, 1 microgram/kg, given over 30 s followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil), remifentanil, 0.5 microgram/kg, given over 30 s followed by a continuous infusion of 0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil+midazolam). Five minutes after the start of the infusion, patients received a loading dose of saline placebo (remifentanil) or midazolam, 1 mg, (remifentanil+midazolam). If patients were not oversedated, a second dose of placebo or midazolam, 1 mg, was given. Remifentanil was titrated (in increments of 50% from the initial rate) to limit patient discomfort or pain intraoperatively, and the infusion was terminated at the completion of skin closure.", 
    "126": "At the time of the local anesthetic, most patients in the remifentanil and remifentanil+midazolam groups experienced no pain (66% and 60%, respectively) and no discomfort (66% and 65%, respectively). The final mean (+/-SD) remifentanil infusion rates were 0.12 +/- 0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil) and 0.07 +/- 0.03 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil+midazolam). Fewer patients in the remifentanil+midazolam group experienced nauses compared with the remifentanil group (16% vs. 36%, respectively; P < 0.05). Four patients (5%) in the remifentanil group and two patients (2%) in the remifentanil+midazolam group experienced brief periods of oxygen desaturation (SpO2 < 90%) and hypoventilation (< 8 breaths/ min).", 
    "127": "Remifentanil alone or combined with midazolam provided adequate analgesia and maintained adequate respiration at the doses reported. The low dose of remifentanil combined with 2 mg midazolam, compared with remifentanil alone, resulted in fewer side effects, slightly greater sedation, and less anxiety.", 
    "128": "Gender-dependent differences in cytochrome P450 activity, drug metabolism, drug elimination, and their clinical consequences are increasingly apparent. P450 3A4 is the most abundant P450 isoform in the human liver and is responsible for metabolizing a vast and diverse assortment of therapeutic agents, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and local anesthetics. P450, 3A4 activity is higher in women, influenced by steroid hormone levels, and is speculated to vary during the menstrual cycle. This investigation tested the hypothesis that P450 3A4 activity varies during the menstrual cycle. Alfentanil clearance was used as a metabolic probe for P450 3A4 activity.", 
    "129": "Alfentanil (20 micrograms/kg bolus) was administered to nine nonsmoking, nonpregnant female volunteers (age, 26 +/- 5 yr) with normal menstrual cycles on three separate occasions during the same menstrual cycle: days 2 (menstrual phase), 13 (estrogen peak), and 21 (progesterone peak). Venous plasma alfentanil concentrations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Alfentanil clearance was determined by noncompartmental methods and by a three-compartment model with both pooled population and two-stage analysis.", 
    "130": "There was no significant difference in any measure of alfentanil clearance. Noncompartmental clearances (mean +/- SD) were 3.62 +/- 0.76, 3.81 +/- 0.96, and 3.60 +/- 0.84 ml/kg/ min, respectively, on days 2, 13, and 21 of the menstrual cycle.", 
    "131": "Alfentanil clearances were not different on menstrual cycle days 2, 13, and 21, strongly suggesting no change in P450 3A4 activity. Menstrual cycle differences in alfentanil clearances do not contribute to interindividual variability in alfentanil disposition in women. If other P450 3A4 substrates are comparable, then menstrual cycle variability in their metabolism may not be a consideration in dosing or in the design of pharmacokinetic investigations.", 
    "132": "The effects of a rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentration on systemic haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines were studied in seven pigs (22-30 kg). Following premedication (flunitrazepam 0.4 mg/kg i.m.), anaesthesia was induced (propofol 2.5 mg/kg i.v., vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg i.v.), the trachea orally intubated, and ventilation controlled. Anaesthesia was maintained with N2O/O2 (70%/30%), propofol (50 micrograms/kg/min), desflurane (2% end-tidal concentration), and vecuronium (0.3 mg/kg/h). After cannulation of both femoral arteries for subsequent simultaneous systemic pressure measurements and blood sampling for determination of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) plasma levels, N2O and propofol were discontinued, and FiO2 and end-tidal concentration of desflurane increased to > 0.9 and 3%, respectively. Forty minutes later, the inspired concentration of desflurane was abruptly increased to 15%. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma concentrations of E and NE were determined before and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 min after increasing the desflurane concentration. Plasma concentrations of E and NE were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Data were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA (significance level P < 0.05). The abrupt increase in inspired desflurane concentration caused an insignificant increase (11%) in HR at 1, 2 and 4 min. There was an immediate decrease in MAP. Plasma levels of E and NE remained unchanged throughout. In conclusion, in contrast to findings in humans, a rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentration does not cause a hyperdynamic circulatory response in the pig.", 
    "133": "Late-life anxiety disorders, commonly seen in primary care settings, can coexist with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. A variety of effective treatment options is available for these patients.", 
    "134": "MEDLINE was searched for articles published from 1970 to 1996 using the key words \"anxiety,\" \"elderly,\" \"aged,\" \"geriatric,\" \"panic,\" \"obsessive-compulsive,\" \"phobia,\" and \"generalized anxiety disorder.\" Studies of patients older than 65 years were reviewed.", 
    "135": "Generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder are the most common late-life anxiety problems seen by primary care physicians. Patients with these disorders complain of diffuse multisystem symptoms, motor restlessness, and such physiologic symptoms as tachycardia or tachypnea. Comorbid illnesses include depression, alcoholism, drug use, and multisystem disease. Behavioral strategies to address anxiety include an open discussion of the issue, an anxiety diary, psychosocial support, and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Pharmacologic strategies include carefully monitored benzodiazepine, buspirone, or antidepressant therapy.", 
    "136": "Clinical trials of all anxiety interventions are needed for elderly primary care patients to clarify further whether findings from mixed-age population studies are generalizable to the elderly.", 
    "137": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor complex is allosterically modulated by a variety of substances, some of clinical importance. Barbiturates and neurosteroids augment GABA-currents and also directly gate the channel. A variety of gamma-butyrolactone analogues also modulate GABA-induced currents, with some potentiating and others inhibiting. Because several gamma-thiobutyrolactone analogues have biphasic effects on GABA currents, experiments with wild-type and picrotoxinin-insensitive GABA(A) receptors were performed to analyze whether some gamma-thiobutyrolactones interact with two distinguishable sites on the GABA(A) receptor. beta-Ethyl-beta-methyl-gamma-thiobutyrolactone inhibited GABA-induced currents at low concentrations (0.001-1 mM), but potentiated GABA-induced currents at higher concentrations (3-10 mM) in wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2-subunit containing ionophores. The related alpha-ethyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-thiobutyrolactone potentiated submaximal GABA currents in wild-type receptors at both low and high concentrations (0.1-10 mM). Mutations in the second transmembrane domain of alpha1, beta2, or gamma2 conferred picrotoxinin-insensitivity onto GABA(A) receptor complexes. When these mutated alpha1, beta2, or gamma2 subunits were incorporated into the receptor complex, beta-ethyl-beta-methyl-gamma-thiobutyrolactone potentiated GABA currents over the entire concentration range (0.1-10 mM). Neither the potentiating activity nor the EC50 of alpha-ethyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-thiobutyrolactone changed in the mutant receptors. Further studies demonstrated that the mutations did not affect the EC50 of chlordiazepoxide or phenobarbital. These and our earlier results identify a modulatory site on the GABA(A) receptor distinct from that interacting with barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and steroids. Additionally, they show that the gamma-butyrolactones probably interact at two different sites on the ionophore to produce opposite effects on GABA-mediated current.", 
    "138": "While occasional myoclonic jerks are prevalent in cancer patients receiving opioids, severe myoclonic jerks and seizures due to opioids are uncommon. In this retrospective case series, we describe five cancer patients with refractory cancer pain and severe neuroexcitatory toxicity associated with extremely high-dose opioid therapy to characterize better the syndrome, its treatment, and its outcome. Two patients died following seizures, but three patients recovered following prompt treatment with parenteral midazolam infusions and rotation to alternative opioids. Possible mechanisms and treatment options for this potentially lethal clinical syndrome are reviewed. The authors conclude that severe multifocal myoclonus and seizures associated with extremely high-dose opioid therapy are life-threatening, and respond to parenteral midazolam infusion, rotation to alternative opioids, and aggressive supportive care.", 
    "139": "An endogenous neuroactive steroid, pregnanolone, and an orally available synthetic analog, CCD-3693, were administered to rats at the middle of their circadian activity phase (6 hr after lights off). Electroencephalogram-defined sleep-wake states, locomotor activity and body temperature were concurrently measured 30 hr before and after treatment. Identical procedures were used to test triazolam and zolpidem. Triazolam (0.1-1.6 mg/kg), zolpidem (2.5-10 mg/kg) and the neuroactive steroids (10-30 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent increases in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. At this dose and time of day (in which the rats were predominantly awake during the 6 hr before treatment) the neuroactive steroids appeared more intrinsically efficacious in promoting NREM sleep than the benzodiazepine ligands. The neurosteroids did not, however, significantly interfere with rapid eye movement sleep and were more selective in reducing (EEG) wakefulness, with relatively less locomotor activity impairment during waking than triazolam and zolpidem. In addition, the benzodiazepine receptor ligands showed distinct \"rebound\" wakefulness after the NREM sleep-promoting effect subsided, although the neuroactive steroids did not. In addition, in vitro binding studies and in vivo pharmacological data confirmed that CCD-3693 was orally active in standard tests of anxiety, anticonvulsant, loss-of-righting and passive avoidance.", 
    "140": "Agonists acting at benzodiazepine, gamma-aminobutyric acidA, barbiturate and neurosteroid recognition sites were studied for their attenuation of separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) in rat pups. The behavioral effects of the neuroactive steroid 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) were assessed when the drug was administered alone and in combination with agonists and antagonists acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex. At 7 days postpartum, male and female Long-Evans rat pups were separated from the dam and littermates, and placed on a 20 degrees C surface for 2 min. Allopregnanolone (1-30 mg/kg s.c.), alprazolam (0.03-1 mg/kg s.c.), diazepam (0.1-3 mg/kg s.c.), muscimol (0.03-0.3 mg/kg s.c.) and pentobarbital (1-30 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently decreased USV. Pretreatment with flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) antagonized alprazolam's and diazepam's USV-suppressive effects; bicuculline (2 mg/kg s.c.) reversed muscimol's USV-suppressive effects. Allopregnanolone (3 mg/kg s.c.) produced a 4- to 7-fold leftward shift in alprazolam's and diazepam's USV-suppressive effects, and also produced a modest leftward shift in pentobarbital's USV dose-effect function. Neither flumazenil, bicuculline, nor picrotoxin (1 mg/kg s.c.) altered allopregnanolone's USV-suppressive effects. These results suggest that the USV-suppressive effects of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone are mediated at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex, and are independent from a direct action on the benzodiazepine or gamma-aminobutyric acidA recognition sites on this complex.", 
    "141": "In these studies, we characterized the influence of the novel benzodioxopiperazine serotonin (5-HT)1A ligand, S 15535, on the release of 5-HT in rat hippocampus and compared its potential anxiolytic properties with those of the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, buspirone, the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100,635 and the benzodiazepine, diazepam (DZM). (Doses are in milligrams per kilogram s.c., unless otherwise specified.) S 15535 dose-dependently (0.3-3.0) reduced dialysate concentrations of 5-HT in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. This action of S 15535 (3.0) was blocked by WAY 100,635 (0.3), (-)-penbutolol (2.0) and (-)-tertatolol (8.0), antagonists at 5-HT1A autoreceptors. In rats, fear-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were dose-dependently abolished by S 15535 (0.16-2.5 s.c. and 0.63-10.0 p.o.), an action mimicked by buspirone (0.02-2.5) and DZM (0.16-10.0). Further, the action of S 15535 (0.63) was abolished by WAY 100,635 (0.16) and (-)-penbutolol (10.0), which were inactive alone. S 15535 dose-dependently (0.63-10.0 s.c. and 2.5-40.0 p.o.) blocked aggressive encounters in isolated mice; buspirone (0.16-10.0) and, at high doses, DZM (2.5-40.0) were also effective. WAY 100,635 (0.16), which was inactive alone, fully antagonized the antiaggressive actions of S 15535 (2.5). In an elevated plus-maze, neither S 15535 (0.0025-10.0), buspirone (0.0025-10.0) nor WAY 100,635 (0.00063-0.63) significantly increased open-arm entries, whereas they were increased by DZM (0.16-0.63). In the pigeon conflict test, S 15535 (0.04-0.16 i.m.) markedly increased punished responses and only slightly decreased unpunished responses, even at a 64-fold higher dose. In contrast, buspirone (0.16-2.5 i.m.) and DZM (0.04-2.5 i.m.) showed no or a less marked (4-fold) separation between doses increasing punished and decreasing unpunished responses. In the presence of the 5-HT1A antagonist, (-)-alprenolol (10.0 mg/kg i.m.), S 15535 did not increase punished responses. In a Geller conflict paradigm in rats, S 15535 dose dependently (0.3-3.0) increased punished responses, and its action (1.0) was blocked by (-)-penbutolol (8.0). S 15535 (0.63-40.0 s.c. and 2.5-40.0 p.o.) exerted little influence on motor behavior. In conclusion, in line with its net inhibition of serotoninergic transmission by activation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors and blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, S 15535 expresses anxiolytic activity. In addition, it displays antiaggressive (and antidepressant, accompanying paper) properties. Further, S 15535 does not compromise motor behavior at doses over which it expresses its anxiolytic properties. Thus, S 15535 represents a promising candidate for the treatment of anxious states in man."
