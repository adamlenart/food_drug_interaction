Some nitrogenated compounds have been reported to coordinate with the iron atom from the heme group, thus inhibiting NOS. 1,4-Benzodiazepines are nitrogenated compounds which have many physiological effects such as antianxiety, antiepileptic, hypnotic, and muscle relaxation properties. The aim of this paper was to measure the effect of different benzodiazepines on NOS activity in pig brain extracts. Medazepam, pinazepam, diazepam, oxazepam and alprazolam competitively inhibited NOS with IC(50) in the micromolar range. Other benzodiazepines showed no effect at concentrations as high as 200 microM. Due to the structural similarity of the benzodiazepine ring nucleus with L-arginine, we propose a benzodiazepine-enzyme interaction to explain the competitive inhibitions. By comparing benzodiazepine effects and their structures, the inhibitory effect of benzodiazepines on NOS is related to the absence of substituents on N4 and to the absence of a halogen substituent on C5 phenyl group. Although benzodiazepine's inhibitions observed in this study are not in the physiological range in normal cases, these inhibitions could be significant in drug abuse situations and should be taken into account for the rational design of drugs which specifically inhibit NOS.", 
    "1": "The outflow of [(3)H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([(3)H]5-HT) from electrically stimulated rat cortical slices was measured to ascertain the modulatory role of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) on the amine outflow and to test the hypothesis that different anxiolytic compounds inhibit 5-HT secretion. The [(3)H]5-HT outflow evoked at 10 Hz was increased up to +30% by CCK(4) 300-1000 nM, the effect being prevented by the CCK(B) receptor antagonist GV 150013, 3 nM. The limited sensitivity to CCK(4) seemed to depend on 5-HT auto-receptor feedback because pre-treatment with 100 nM methiothepin enhanced the [(3)H]5-HT outflow and lowered the CCK(4) threshold concentration from 300 to 30 nM. In addition, pre-treatment with 1 microM bacitracin to inhibit CCK metabolism increased [(3)H]5-HT efflux. This effect was concentration-dependently counteracted by GV150013 suggesting the presence of an endogenous CCK positive modulation. GV150013 30 nM, the 5-HT(1A) partial agonist buspirone 300 nM and the GABA(A) receptor modulator diazepam 10 nM, known to have anxiolytic properties, all significantly reduced the [(3)H] amine outflow from cortical slices by about 20%. This inhibition depended on their interaction with their respective receptors, which seemed to restrain the activity of functionally interconnected glutamatergic interneurones. In fact, APV (50 microM) and NBQX (10 microM) prevented the effect of the anxiolytic compounds. Thus, anxiolytic drugs with different receptor targets can reduce 5-HT outflow by dampening the glutamatergic signal, and in turn, the secretory process of the serotonergic nerve ending.", 
    "2": "Tamoxifen (TAM) is a first-line endocrine treatment for all stages of postmenopausal breast cancer. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes catalyze the majority of TAM's primary metabolism, producing N-desmethyltamoxifen (DMT) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-TAM) in both humans and rats. CYP 3A isoforms are the predominant subfamily involved in the formation of DMT and recent studies have shown that TAM induces hepatic forms of these enzymes. TAM's inductive effect on gastrointestinal CYP 3A has not been previously reported. The current studies investigated TAM's induction of CYP isoforms (3A and 2B) in female rat gastrointestinal and hepatic tissue at the mRNA, protein, and catalytic level. Since previous studies have not addressed whether TAM induction causes changes to the overall pharmacokinetics (PKs), a rat PK model was used to determine if TAM induced its own metabolism, and/or the metabolism of a CYP 3A substrate, midazolam (MDZ). Phenobarbital (PB) and/or dexamethasone (DEX) were used as positive controls for all studies. TAM significantly induced, or caused a trend towards induction of all studied parameters for hepatic CYP 3A and 2B, whereas intestinal CYP 3A and 2B analysis did not show significant induction by TAM at any level. A study evaluating time-dependent alterations in the PK profile of TAM showed no change in apparent oral clearance (Cl(app)) during two weeks of chronic dosing with TAM. However, the Cl(app) for MDZ was shown to trend towards an increase after two weeks of dosing with TAM, in a second PK study. These combined investigations suggest that TAM is an inducer of rat hepatic CYP 3A and 2B isoforms, and this agent has the potential of influencing the PK of coadministered 3A substrates.", 
    "3": "In this study, we evaluated whether beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may modify the protective efficacy of dizocilpine (MK-801), a NMDA receptor antagonist, and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466), a non-NMDA (AMPA/kainate) receptor antagonist, against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice. Propranolol, acebutolol, metoprolol and atenolol were used in doses that did not alter the electroconvulsive threshold. Propranolol potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of MK-801 and GYKI 52466, significantly lowering their ED(50) values from 0.38 and 15.0 to 0.15 (P<0.001) and 8.4 mg/kg (P<0.001), respectively. Similarly, metoprolol lowered the ED(50) of MK-801 and GYKI 52466 from 0.38 and 15.0 to 0.17 (P<0.05) and 11.2 mg/kg (P<0.05). Acebutolol enhanced the protective action of GYKI 52466, lowering its ED(50) value from 15.0 to 12.2 mg/kg (P<0.05), but not that of MK-801. Atenolol, not penetrating the blood-brain barrier, did not affect the anticonvulsive efficacy of MK-801 and GYKI 52466. In conclusion, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may act synergistically with excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists to inhibit generalised tonic-clonic seizures.",

    "5": "The Da Vinci robot device represents the latest advance in laparoendoscopic surgery. We report the case of an endoscopic Nissen fundoplication performed with the aid of a telemanipulation robot system in a 10-year-old girl. To our knowledge, this is the first such case to be reported. In addition to standard monitoring, we used invasive blood pressure monitoring during the 282-min period of general anesthesia. Arterial blood gas samples were analyzed at short intervals. During surgery, which included a 172-min period of intraperitoneal insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO2), no significant changes were observed in PH, arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2), heart rate, or mean arterial pressure. Body temperature was maintained with an external warming blanket. Total intravenous anesthesia with continously administered propofol, remifentanil, and mivacurium for continous muscle relaxation allowed extubation immediately after skin closure. The girl was discharged from hospital on postoperative day 6. Robot-assisted techniques have the potential to significantly improve the performance of laparoendoscopic surgery. However, despite our encouraging first results, the potential risks of robot-assisted surgery have not yet been definitively established. Therefore, patients submitted to this type of procedure require intensive and even invasive monitoring.", 
    "6": "Sedation usually decreases the reliability of subjectively detecting an intravascular test dose, but the efficacies of objective hemodynamic and T-wave criteria remain undetermined. Sixty healthy patients were randomly assigned to receive IV midazolam in 1-mg increments until they were lightly sedated, fentanyl 2 microg/kg followed by incremental midazolam until they were similarly sedated, or no sedative (n = 20 each). Then, normal saline 3 mL was administered IV, followed 4 min later by 1.5% lidocaine 3 mL plus epinephrine 15 microg (1:200,000) in all subjects. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured by a radial arterial catheter, and lead II of the electrocardiogram were continuously recorded for 4 min after the saline and test dose injections. An IV test dose produced significant increases in HR and SBP and decreases in T-wave amplitude in all subjects. However, the mean maximum increase in HR in patients sedated with midazolam plus fentanyl (31 +/- 14 bpm [mean +/- SD]) was significantly less than in those administered midazolam alone or no sedative (42 +/- 12 and 44 +/- 10 bpm, respectively; P < 0.05). A sensitivity of 100% was obtained on the basis of the traditional HR criterion (positive if > or =20 bpm increase) in patients sedated with midazolam or no sedative, but it was 70% in those with midazolam plus fentanyl (P < 0.05 versus the other two groups). Irrespective of the treatment, sensitivities and specificities of 100% were obtained according to the SBP (positive if > or =15 mm Hg increase) and T-wave (positive if > or =25% decrease in amplitude) criteria. An increase in SBP and a decrease in T-wave amplitude are more reliable than an HR response for detecting accidental intravascular injection of the epinephrine-containing test dose in subjects sedated with midazolam and fentanyl.", 
    "7": "To determine whether an epidural catheter is in a blood vessel, an epidural test dose containing 15 microg epinephrine is used. We found that an increase in systolic blood pressure and a decrease in T-wave amplitude seem to be more reliable than a heart rate change for detecting inadvertent intravascular injection of an epinephrine-containing test dose in patients sedated with midazolam and fentanyl.", 
    "8": "Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric condition of both acute and chronic liver failure. Acute liver failure is characterized by rapid evolution of HE and by brain edema. Portal-Systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is particularly prevalent following treatment of portal hypertension or ascites by the TIPS procedure. Available evidence currently suggests that neurotransmission changes rather than brain energy failure are the primary cause of HE. Recent studies both in autopsied brain tissue from HE patients as well as in experimental animal models of HE reveal that liver failure results in altered expression of several genes coding for proteins having key roles in the control of neuronal excitability. Such alterations include decreased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and increased expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) as well as constitutive neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Such changes result in altered protein expression and in increased extracellular brain glutamate, increased degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters, increased synthesis of neurosteroids with inhibitory properties, and increased production of nitric oxide (respectively) in brain in chronic liver failure. In the case of GLT-1, PTBR, and nNOS, alterations in expression result from exposure to ammonia and/or manganese, two neurotoxic agents shown previously to be increased in brain in liver failure.", 
    "9": "The P300 complex was derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) as subjects mentally counted infrequent large checkerboard visual stimuli, presented randomly among frequent small checkerboard stimuli. Use of low contrast (10%) stimuli and four midline scalp electrodes, facilitated separation of cognitive and sensory components and enabled the P300 complex to be resolved into three distinct components--N200, P3a, and P3b. In 20 healthy adult subjects normative data were established and the P3a and P3b components were shown to depend on cognitive function. In 19 age-matched cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) the EEG and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were normal, but latencies of P3a and/or P3b were prolonged in 9. Prolonged latencies were not associated with an abnormal number connection test. Ten additional age-matched cirrhotic patients without overt HE, who were alcohol, drug, and caffeine free, were randomized to receive flumazenil (1 mg) and placebo intravenously, double-blind. After flumazenil or placebo, latencies of P3a and P3b and psychometric test results did not change significantly. These findings suggest that in cirrhotic patients without overt HE (i) impaired cognitive sensory function may occur in the absence of abnormalities of a standard psychometric test, the EEG, or VEPs, and (ii) increased latencies of P3a and P3b may constitute a component of subclinical HE, which is not mediated by increased brain levels of central benzodiazepine receptor agonist ligands.", 
    "10": "We report a 14-year-old girl with carbamazepine intoxication who developed alpha coma and status epilepticus. She fell into deep coma and developed frequent generalized convulsions. The EEG during coma showed diffuse alpha activity predominantly in the frontal area. Serum carbamazepine concentration was 42.8 micrograms/ml. The convulsions were suppressed by diazepam only transiently, and by midazolam completely. Although half a day had passed since carbamazepine ingestion, we could wash out much of drug remnants by gastric lavage. Thereafter, the serum concentration of carbamazepine decreased efficiently and the patient recovered dramatically without complication. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatments should improve the prognosis of carbamazepine intoxication.",

    "12": "Review articles and primary literature representative of current knowledge regarding the treatment of insomnia were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-January 2001). Search terms included insomnia (sleep initiation and maintenance disorders), benzodiazepines, zaleplon, zolpidem, and trazodone.", 
    "13": "Literature regarding the management of insomnia in hospitalized patients is limited; therefore, data pertinent to the treatment of ambulatory patients must be extrapolated to the inpatient setting. When evaluating insomnia in hospitalized patients, it seems reasonable to obtain a thorough history and physical examination to identify potential underlying etiologies. Treatment of these underlying etiologies should be considered. When the use of a sedative-hypnotic agent is necessary, medication and dose selection should be based on the pharmacokinetic and adverse effect profiles of each agent. Patent-specific characteristics should also be considered to provide effective treatment while minimizing adverse effects.", 
    "14": "Nonpharmacologic approaches to the treatment of insomnia should be considered for hospitalized patients. When sedative-hypnotic medications must be administered, the pharmacokinetic profile of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, temazepam) makes them good first-line agents. Zaleplon and zolpidem are also attractive hypnotic agents; however, they are typically reserved for second-line therapy due to cost. Trazodone may be an alternative for patients unable to take benzodiazepines.", 
    "15": "Spasticity is a result of an imbalance between the afferent excitatory and descending inhibitory pathways after central nervous system damage. Its pharmacologic control is believed to result from the antagonism of inhibitory mechanisms (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] or glycine-mediated antagonism of excitatory mechanisms), or both. Because GABA receptor sites are widely present in the central nervous system, it is amenable to pharmacologic manipulation.", 
    "16": "The concept of shyness in young children is not new; however, only recently has it been recognized that childhood SAD is a prevalent and severe disorder, with both immediate and long-term implications for academic, social, and emotional functioning. With the recognition that this disorder can result in severe lifetime impairment, both pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions for youth with social phobia are now beginning to be developed, and their efficacy, to be determined. The study of efficacious pharmacologic treatments with childhood anxiety disorders is limited at this time. There has been even less research regarding pharmacotherapy samples of children with childhood social phobia or social anxiety only. Only seven clinical trials have been conducted, and among those, only three were placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. In all of the open-labeled trials, anxious children showed improvement on both SSRIs and benzodiazepines; however, two of the three double-blind studies were unable to replicate these treatment benefits compared with placebo. The inability to find treatment effects may be a manifestation of the small sample sizes used and the comorbidity of the samples used to date. Further examination of the SSRIs and benzodiazepines with placebo-controlled studies is needed to provide more conclusive support for the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment. Similar to pharmacologic studies, research has begun to accumulate that sheds light on effective psychosocial interventions for childhood social phobia. Future research investigating the relative contribution of specific treatment components will allow for greater efficiency in the delivery of these services. Currently, which components are necessary or sufficient is unknown, although, based on meta-analyses conducted with adult outcome studies, exposure in some form seems to be the key ingredient. In addition, little attention has been given to developmental considerations regarding understanding the utility of specific psychosocial treatment components. For example, Spence et al reported that younger socially phobic children (aged 7-9 years) experienced difficulty in understanding the concept of \"cognitive challenging,\" thus necessitating a reduction of this treatment component for this group. In addition, because differences in treatment effects across age groups was not reported, is it unclear whether the addition of a cognitive challenging component is even warranted. Similarly, Beidel et al reported significant improvement rates without the inclusion of a specific cognitive restructuring component. Thus, future research is needed to clarify the exact utility of including this intervention in treatment. Investigations have begun to accumulate that focus solely on the treatment of childhood social phobia, as opposed to general anxiety symptoms. As a result, preliminary evidence supports the use of pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments. Nonetheless, further research is needed to provide a better understanding of the efficacy of different interventions and, in the case of psychosocial treatments, different treatment components for socially phobic children across different developmental periods. Moreover, controlled treatment outcome studies that include specific measures of social anxiety and functioning, in addition to DSM diagnostic criteria, should provide a better (i.e., more thorough) evaluation of specific treatment effects for socially phobic children and adolescents.", 
    "17": "Over the past 21 years since the birth of SP into the diagnostic nomenclature, there have been significant gains in knowledge about effective pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments. The SSRIs have emerged as the first-line pharmacologic treatment, although good evidence shows efficacy of benzodiazepines; MAOIs; and anticonvulsant agents, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. There is also emerging evidence about the efficacy of the novel antidepressant venlafaxine and also optimism for the potential utility of nefazodone and possibly bupropion. However, there are many areas requiring further investigation. There has been a great deal of excitement about the publication of the RUPP Anxiety Study, demonstrating efficacy for fluvoxamine in socially phobic youth. Given that SP starts in childhood and adolescence, more data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age group because early intervention may prevent the sequelae of chronic SP. There needs to be more investigation into what is required for social phobic individuals who obtain a good response to pharmacotherapy to move into full-remission status. Additional research is needed regarding the evaluation of the comparative efficacy of different drug classes and to develop an improved capability of predicting treatment response to a particular type of treatment. In addition, more research is needed regarding treatment resistance. In most of the anxiety disorders that have been studied, combining CBT with psychopharmacologic treatment has shown little advantage over either treatment alone. These findings may be due to methodologic problems. Research is needed on how to sequence treatments to maximize the benefits of combining the two types of effective treatments together. Finally, many clinicians are seeing an emerging trend of individuals who have had untreated SP all of their lives and are now presenting for treatment in their \"golden years.\" The current established treatments need to be evaluated further in this geriatric population.", 
    "18": "The importance of progesterone biosynthesis and metabolism to 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), which exerts its effects via GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GBRs) rather than intracellular progestin receptors (PRs), was investigated for its effects on sexual receptivity. Epostane, a 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, blocks progesterone and 3alpha,5alpha-THP biosynthesis. Finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, blocks the metabolism of progesterone to dihydroprogesterone (DHP), which is subsequently metabolized to 3alpha,5alpha-THP. Indomethacin, a 3alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase inhibitor, blocks DHP's metabolism to 3alpha,5alpha-THP, and its oxidation to DHP. Epostane, finasteride, indomethacin or vehicle were infused intracranially in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of hormone-primed or naturally receptive rats and hamsters and sexual behaviour was recorded. Epostane, finasteride and indomethacin to the VTA significantly reduced lordosis, compared to vehicle infusions, in hormone-primed and behavioural oestrous rats and hamsters. Radioimmunoassay revealed that concentrations of midbrain 3alpha,5alpha-THP were reduced following epostane, finasteride or indomethacin infusions that significantly decreased lordosis. Immunocytochemistry for 3alpha,5alpha-THP revealed the number of immunoreactive cells were significantly reduced in the VTA following epostane, finasteride or indomethacin infusion to the VTA, but not other midbrain sites. These data suggest that biosynthesis of progestins, and the metabolism of progesterone to 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the VTA, are important for progestin-facilitated sexual receptivity of rats and hamsters.", 
    "19": "A 62-year-old female patient is described who developed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) after medication with phenytoin and oxazepam. Initially phenytoin was discontinued and dexamethasone pulse therapy (1.5 mg/kg on 3 consecutive days) was initiated on the tenth day of skin disease. This resulted in clinical improvement. Histologically re-epithelialization could be demonstrated below the necrotic epidermis. However, on the eighteenth day of skin disease (10 days after discontinuation of phenytoin and 8 days after the start of dexamethasone pulse therapy), a histologically verified rebound-TEN developed with a detachment of 95%. Oxazepam was stopped and a second series of dexamethasone pulse therapy was given. Re-epithelialization began within 24 h of the start of the second series of dexamethasone pulse therapy, and continued to almost complete recovery within 1 week.", 
    "20": "The anticonvulsant drug vigabatrin has not been found to be detrimental to the recovery process when administered following focal cortical insult. This finding is in contrast to the negative postinjury consequences of other anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phenobarbital and diazepam) with more direct activation of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Moreover, phenobarbital directed against kindled seizures affects functional recovery more adversely than either the drug or subconvulsive seizures alone. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether vigabatrin (150, 200, and 250 mg/kg) directed against kindled seizures would impact recovery from lesion-induced somatosensory deficits. Vigabatrin was coupled with daily electrical kindling of the amygdala during the first week after a unilateral anteromedial cortex (AMC) lesion. Somatosensory recovery was assessed using bilateral tactile stimulation tests. Animals receiving the highest dose of vigabatrin prior to electrical kindling (250 mg/kg vigabatrin/kindled) remained significantly impaired even after two months of testing relative to vehicle/kindled, kindled/250 mg/kg vigabatrin, which received vigabatrin after electrical kindling, and the 150, 200, and 250 mg/kg vigabatrin/nonkindled groups (p < 0.0001). In contrast, neither vigabatrin (at any of the doses tested) nor subconvulsive kindled seizures impacted the recovery process (p > 0.05) when administered alone (i.e., without the drug + seizure interaction). These data add to the accumulating experimental and clinical evidence suggesting that the neurobehavioral consequences of the interaction between anticonvulsant drugs and subclinical seizures after brain insult are detrimental to functional recovery.",

    "22": "Excitotoxic mechanisms involving alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)/kainate receptors play an important role in mediating cellular damage in spinal cord injury. However, the precise cellular mechanisms of glutamate release from non-synaptic white matter are not well understood. We examined how the collapse of transmembrane Na(+) and K(+) gradients induces reverse operation of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transporters, leading to glutamate efflux and injury to rat spinal dorsal columns in vitro. Compound action potentials were irreversibly reduced to 43% of control after ouabain/high K(+)/low Na(+) exposure (500 microM ouabain for 30 min to increase [Na(+)](i), followed by 1 h ouabain+high K(+) (129 mM)/low Na(+) (27 mM), to further reverse transmembrane ion gradients) followed by a 2 h wash. Ca(2+)-free perfusate was very protective (compound action potential amplitude recovered to 87% vs. 43%). The broad spectrum glutamate antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mM) or the selective AMPA antagonist GYKI52466 (30 microM) were partially protective (68% recovery). Inhibition of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transport with L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (1 mM) also provided significant protection (71% recovery), similar to that seen with glutamate receptor antagonists. Blocking reverse Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange with KB-R7943 (10 microM) however, was ineffective in this paradigm (49% recovery). Semiquantitative glutamate immunohistochemistry revealed that levels of this amino acid were significantly depleted in axon cylinders and, to a lesser degree, in oligodendrocytes (but not in astrocytes) by ouabain/high K(+)/low Na(+), which was largely prevented by glutamate transport inhibition. Our data show that dorsal column white matter contains the necessary glutamate pools and release mechanisms to induce significant injury. When Na(+) and K(+) gradients are disrupted, even in the absence of reduced cellular energy reserves, reverse operation of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transport will release enough endogenous glutamate to activate AMPA receptors and cause substantial Ca(2+)-dependent injury. This mechanism likely plays an important role during ischemic and traumatic white matter injury, where collapse of transmembrane Na(+) and K(+) gradients occurs.", 
    "23": "Both acute and chronic administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine and dizocilpine have been proposed to mimic some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. The purposes of the present study were first, to characterize the long-term behavioral and neurodegenerative effects of subchronic administration of phencyclidine to perinatal rats and second, to determine whether pretreatment with olanzapine could attenuate these effects. On postnatal days 7, 9 and 11 rat pups were pretreated with either vehicle or olanzapine prior to administration of either saline or phencyclidine (10 mg/kg). Some pups were killed on postnatal day 12 for biochemical determinations and others were tested on postnatal days 24-28 for prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, on postnatal day 42 for phencyclidine-induced locomotor activity and between postnatal days 33 and 70 for acquisition of a delayed spatial learning task. Phencyclidine treatment resulted in a substantial increase in fragmented DNA in the frontal and olfactory cortices consistent with neurodegeneration by an apoptotic mechanism. An increase in the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit mRNA was also observed in the cortex. Gel shift assays showed that phencyclidine also increased the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB proteins in the prefrontal cortex. In tissue from the frontal cortex, western blot analysis revealed that phencyclidine treatment increased Bax and decreased Bcl-X(L) proteins. Later in development, it was observed that perinatal phencyclidine treatment significantly retarded baseline prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle measured shortly after weaning. In 42-day-old rats, it was found that challenge with 2 mg/kg phencyclidine increased locomotor activity to a significantly greater extent in the rats that had been pretreated with phencyclidine. Similarly, perinatal phencyclidine treatment significantly delayed the acquisition of a delayed spatial alternation task. Each of the aforementioned changes (except for the spatial learning task, which was not tested) was significantly inhibited by olanzapine pretreatment, an antipsychotic drug known to be effective against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Further, olanzapine treatment for 12 days following the administration of phencyclidine was also able to reverse the phencyclidine-induced deficit in baseline prepulse inhibition. Together these data suggest that perinatal administration of phencyclidine results in long-term behavioral changes that may be mechanistically related to the apoptotic neurodegeneration observed in the frontal cortex. It is postulated that these deficits may model the hypofrontality observed in schizophrenia and that this model may be helpful in designing appropriate pharmacotherapy.", 
    "24": "In male Wistar rats fed a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids and starch (PUFA+S), the percentage of muricidal (Mu) rats increased to 82% within 60 days. Mu rats had higher serum triglyceride levels and lower cholesterol levels than non-Mu rats. Water intake decreased in all rats on the PUFA+S diet concurrently with the increase in the proportion of Mu rats; protracted water restriction in rats fed standard diet also increased the percentage of Mu rats. In the offspring of two Wistar females fed the PUFA+S diet, the proportion of young Mu rats was 67%. When the PUFA+S diet was replaced with standard diet, the induced Mu behavior was not reversed. PK11195 (6 mg/kg i.p.), clonazepam (0.2 mg/kg i.p.), and flumazenil (15 mg/kg i.p.) were ineffective in reversing the induced Mu behavior, whereas 4'-chlorodiazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) or muscimol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) caused reversals of 63% or 50%, respectively. A 5-hydroxytryptophan overload (60 mg/kg i.p.) also reversed Mu behavior by 71%. All reversal effects were temporary. Pretreatment with yeast for 7 days before the PUFA+S diet was given prevented induction for more than 90 days on the PUFA+S diet, while similar pretreatment 4'Cl-diazepam resulted in 71% prevention of induction. The results are analyzed in terms of the involvement of endozepin, vasopressin, and serotonin receptors, and of possible genetic parameters.",

In the present study, we show that the kainate receptor antagonist LY382884 (10 microM) is selective for presynaptic kainate receptors in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. At a concentration at which it blocks mossy fiber LTP, LY382884 selectively blocks the synaptic activation of a presynaptic kainate receptor that facilitates AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Following the induction of mossy fiber LTP, there is a complete loss of the presynaptic kainate receptor-mediated facilitation of synaptic transmission. These results identify a central role for the presynaptic kainate receptor in the induction of mossy fiber LTP. In addition, these results suggest that the pathway by which kainate receptors facilitate glutamate release is utilized for the expression of mossy fiber LTP.",

Additional, to compare the absorption during various initial periods in the two animal models and man, due to the importance of early absorption in emergency treatment. In a cross-over design, diazepam was nasally administered (7 mg) and intravenously (3 mg), respectively, to six sheep. Diazepam was solubilised in polyethylene glycol 300 in the nasal formulation. The mean nasal bioavailability, t(max) and C(max) were 15% (S.D.+/-8), 5 min (S.D.+/-3) and 934 ng/ml (S.D.+/-593), respectively. Sheep bioavailability was lower than rabbit 54% (P<0.001) and man 34% (P<0.05). In conclusion, the nasal absorption of diazepam was found to be fast, indicating the potential of nasal delivery in acute treatment. The initial (30 min) nasal bioavailability (30 min) for sheep and rabbit is a factor of 2.3 lower and 1.6 higher than man, respectively. The correlation of bioavailability was not optimal between sheep, man and rabbit with differences both in relation to extend and rate.", 
    "41": "Despite considerable evidence showing dramatic changes in the plasticity of GABA(A) receptors during neuronal development and studies showing a direct link between neurosteroid concentrations and alterations in GABA(A) receptor expression, little is known about the role of neurosteroids in GABA(A) receptor plasticity early in development. The relationship between changes in brain concentrations of 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone, 3alpha,5alpha-THP) and GABA(A) receptor function in the brain during early development was investigated in rats. The concentration in fetal forebrain of the pregnane metabolite 3alpha,5alpha-THP declined precipitously prior to parturition, before returning to normal (adult male) values on the day of birth (P0). Postnatal cortical 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels remain quite low (<2 ng/g) until postnatal day 10 (PD10) and PD14 when we found elevated cortical 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels (3.3+/-0.8 and 3.8+/-0.9 ng/g, respectively). These levels reverted to basal values by PD15 (0.56+/-0.4 ng/g). We examined GABA(A) receptor-mediated 36Cl(-) flux in cortex of PD7, PD12 and PD16 rat brain. We found a 32% reduction in the stimulation (apparent E(max)) of 36Cl(-) uptake by muscimol in PD12 tissue relative to adult. The potentiating effects of 3alpha,21-dihydroxy-5alpha-pregnane-20-one (tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, THDOC) and flunitrazepam were decreased in PD12 tissue. These data provide a better understanding of potential contributions endogenous GABAergic neurosteroids may make to normal neuronal development.",

The synthetic strategy includes the preparation of the aryl-[1-(2-nitrobenzyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]methanones (5a-i) followed by their reduction and subsequent cyclization. Affinities of compounds 3a-i and 4a-i for central benzodiazepine as well as for adenosine A1-receptors were determined by radioligand binding assays.

    "44": "GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory transmitter receptors in the CNS. Recombinant GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2) subunits have been demonstrated to assemble as pentamers consisting of two alpha(1), two beta(3), and one gamma(2) subunit. Using truncated and chimeric alpha(1) subunits, we identified the alpha(1)(80-100) sequence as a major binding site for gamma(2) subunits. In addition, we demonstrated its direct interaction with gamma(2)(91-104), a sequence that previously has been identified to form the contact to alpha(1) subunits. The observation that the amino acid residues alpha(1)P96 and alpha(1)H101, which can be photolabeled by [(3)H]flunitrazepam, are located within or adjacent to the alpha(1)(80-100) sequence, indicates that the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors is located close to this intersubunit contact. The observation that alpha(1)(80-100) interacts with gamma(2) but not with beta(3) subunits indicates the existence of an additional beta(3) binding site on alpha(1) subunits. The preferred alternate use of the gamma(2) and beta(3) binding sites in two different alpha(1) subunits of the same receptor ensures the incorporation of only a single gamma(2) subunit and thus, determines subunit stoichiometry of alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors. Distinct binding sites and their alternate use can therefore explain how subunits of hetero-oligomeric transmembrane proteins assemble into a defined protein complex.", 
    "45": "Some substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, the most abundant CYP in the human liver responsible for the metabolism of many structurally diverse therapeutic agents, do not obey classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and demonstrate homotropic and/or heterotropic cooperativity. The unusual kinetics and differential effects observed between substrates of this enzyme confound the prediction of drug clearance and drug-drug interactions from in vitro data. We have investigated the hypothesis that CYP3A4 may bind multiple molecules simultaneously using diazepam (DZ) and testosterone (TS). Both substrates showed sigmoidal kinetics in B-lymphoblastoid microsomes containing a recombinant human CYP3A4 and reductase. When analyzed in combination, TS activated the formation of 3-hydroxydiazepam (3HDZ) and N-desmethyldiazepam (NDZ) (maximal activation 374 and 205%, respectively). For 3HDZ, V(max) values remained constant with increasing TS, whereas the S(50) and Hill values decreased, tending to make the data less sigmoidal. Similar trends were observed for the NDZ pathway. DZ inhibited the formation 6beta-hydroxytestosterone (maximal inhibition, 45% of control), causing a decrease in V(max) but no significant change to the S(50) and Hill values, suggesting that DZ may inhibit via a separate effector site. Multisite rate equation models have been derived to explore the analysis of such complex kinetic data and to allow accurate determination of the kinetic parameters for activation and inhibition. The data and models presented are consistent with proposals that CYP3A4 can bind and metabolize multiple substrate molecules simultaneously; they also provide a generic solution for the interpretation of the complex kinetic data derived from CYP3A4 substrates.", 
    "46": "Pregabalin, an analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that does not interact with GABA receptors, is in development as an analgesic, an anticonvulsant, and an anxiolytic. We evaluated the potential somnogenic actions of pregabalin in rats and compared it to those of triazolam, a widely used hypnotic. Pregabalin increased the duration of nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and decreased rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) after either dark onset or light onset administration. Triazolam increased duration of NREMS and had no effect on duration of REMS. Pregabalin markedly increased the duration of NREMS episodes and decreased the number of NREMS episodes. Power spectrum analysis revealed pregabalin-induced dose-dependent increases in relative delta power after administration. In contrast, triazolam decreased electroencephalographic power density in low frequency bands. Results suggest that pregabalin is a potential sleep modulating agent.", 
    "47": "Muscarinic autoreceptors modulate cholinergic neurotransmission in animals ranging from insects to humans. No previous studies have characterized autoreceptor modulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release in prefrontal cortex of intact mouse. Data obtained from experiments in 45 mice considered ACh as a phenotype and tested the hypothesis that pharmacologically defined M2 receptors modulate ACh release in prefrontal cortex of C57BL/6J mouse. In vivo microdialysis quantified ACh release during delivery of Ringer's (control) or Ringer's containing muscarinic receptor antagonists. The lowest concentration of each antagonist [scopolamine, pirenzepine, or 11-2[(-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)-acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)-benzodiazepine-one (AF-DX116)] that significantly increased ACh release was determined and defined as the minimum ACh-releasing concentration. Dialysis delivery of scopolamine caused a concentration-dependent increase in ACh release, consistent with the existence of muscarinic autoreceptors. The order of potency for causing increased ACh release was scopolamine = AF-DX116 > pirenzepine. Administration of pertussis toxin into prefrontal cortex blocked the AF-DX116-induced increase in ACh release. These findings support the conclusion that M2 receptors modulate ACh release in C57BL/6J mouse prefrontal cortex. Nearly every human gene has a mouse homolog and the appeal of mouse models is reinforced by the identification of mouse genes causing phenotypic deviants. The present data encourage comparative phenotyping of cortical ACh release in additional mouse strains.", 
    "48": "Midazolam is almost exclusively metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoenzymes. Therefore, midazolam is used as a probe to determine CYP3A levels in humans and rats. A prerequisite for longitudinal determination of CYP3A expression levels using midazolam as a probe is that midazolam itself has no effect on the expression of CYP3A. In the present study, we analyzed the mRNA levels and enzyme activities of the major CYP isoforms in the rat liver after intraperitoneal injection of midazolam (50 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days. CYP3A1 mRNA levels were increased 4-fold in midazolam-treated animals compared with controls, whereas the mRNA levels of CYP3A2, CYP3A9, and CYP3A18 were not altered. The increase in CYP3A1 mRNA was accompanied by a 25% increase in microsomal testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation activity. More strikingly, CYP2B1/2 mRNA levels were increased 22-fold upon midazolam treatment, leading to an 11- to 95-fold enhancement of CYP2B enzyme activity. CYP2C6 mRNA levels were 4 times higher in midazolam-treated animals. Formation of 2alpha-hydroxy-testosterone, mainly catalyzed by CYP2C11, was 2.6-fold lower in liver microsomes from midazolam-treated animals. Midazolam induced CYP2E enzyme activity 2.5-fold at the post-transcriptional level. The induction of CYP2B1/2 mRNA levels by midazolam was dose-dependent (4.5-fold increase at 10 mg/kg). Induction of CYP3A1 and CYP2B expression was also observed in isolated rat hepatocytes cultured with 100 microM midazolam. We conclude that midazolam is a phenobarbital-like CYP inducer in rats. Induction of CYP3A1 by midazolam may have implications for the longitudinal use of midazolam as a probe for analysis of CYP3A expression levels in rats.",

Although his diabetes was stabilized with insulin, his family had difficulty monitoring his therapy, and insulin was discontinued. Subsequent monotherapy with pioglitazone stabilized the patient's glucose levels, allowing him to continue taking olanzapine. Health care professionals should be aware of links between olanzapine and diabetes mellitus and of the potential for delayed recognition of complications associated with diabetes in patients who are psychotic. Insulin poses additional problems because families of patients with schizophrenia have to deal with compliance and risk of accidental or suicidal overdose. This case and others described in the literature illustrate such dilemmas and highlight the need to further study links connecting diabetes, insulin resistance, and olanzapine.

The effects of pentobarbital were not altered by beta-CCM, suggesting that barbiturates might act at a population of GABA(A) receptors different from those where neuroactive steroids and BZs act, or that barbiturate site positive GABA(A) modulators are not amenable to modulation by negative modulators.",

Recent pharmacotherapeutic research on treatments for this condition has focused on antidepressant drugs with serotonergic actions. However, the presence of intrusive, psychotic-like symptoms in a substantial portion of PTSD patients raises the possibility that antipsychotics with serotonergic properties might also prove useful in treating PTSD. We conducted an open-label 8-week study of olanzapine treatment in veterans with combat-induced PTSD. Primary outcome measures in this study were the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Secondary outcome measures included the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HRSD) and Anxiety (HRSA). Forty-eight patients enrolled in the study, and 30 completed the 8-week trial. Results of intent-to-treat and completer analyses demonstrated that all outcome measures improved significantly during treatment.

In addition, processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) was monitored employing spectral edge frequency 90 (SEF 90) as an indicator of sedation. Both drugs produced good sedation without any complication. The patients who had received propofol were extubated significantly earlier than those who had received midazolam (P; 35 +/- 18 mins, M; 97 +/- 55 mins). However, the mean drug cost in the propofol group was five times higher than that in the midazolam group (P; yen 15,881 +/- 7,788, M; yen 3,355 +/- 1,187). There was no correlation between the value of SEF 90 and the depth of sedation during mechanical ventilation.

We transiently introduced the human GABA(A) receptor epsilon subunit cDNA into a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line stably expressing alpha1beta3gamma2 receptors (WSS-1 cells) to establish whether the subunit competes with the gamma2 subunit for assembly into receptors. GABA-evoked currents were recorded using the patch-clamp technique from cells transfected with cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone or in combination with the epsilon subunit cDNA. 2. The epsilon subunit did not change the potency of GABA: the GABA EC(50) was 34 +/- 6 microM in control WSS-1 cells and 37 +/- 6 microM in cells expressing the epsilon subunit. The introduction of the epsilon subunit reduced the peak current amplitude activated by GABA (1 mM) from 1.8 +/- 0.2 nA in control cells to 0.9 +/- 0.2 nA in cells expressing the epsilon subunit (P < 0.05). 3. The epsilon subunit caused the appearance of leak currents recorded in the absence of GABA. Outside-out patches excised from epsilon subunit-containing WSS-1 cells exhibited spontaneously opening GABA(A) channels not seen in patches excised from control GFP-expressing WSS-1 cells. Introduction of the epsilon subunit did not alter the GABA-evoked single-channel cord conductance. 4. The anaesthetic 2,6-diisopropylphenol (propofol, 3 microM) and the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (1 microM) potentiated GABA-evoked currents recorded from control cells labelled with GFP. The epsilon subunit reduced potentiation by both agents 48-96 h after transfection. 5. The introduction of the epsilon subunit had no effect on the ability of propofol (3-30 microM) relative to GABA (1 mM) to activate GABA(A) receptors in WSS-1 cells. High concentrations of propofol (> or = 100 microM) produced a more marked desensitization of GABA(A) receptor activity in WSS-1 cells transfected with cDNA for the epsilon subunit than in control cells. 6. There was no difference in the potency of Zn(2+) as an inhibitor of currents recorded from control cells (IC(50) = 165 +/- 34 microM) or cells expressing the epsilon subunit (IC(50) = 179 +/- 11 microM). 7. GABA-activated currents recorded both from control cells and cells expressing the epsilon subunit reversed in sign at the Cl- equilibrium potential and exhibited outward rectification. 8.

The atypical antipsychotic risperidone (1 microM) did not significantly inhibit 2-CH(3) 5-HT-induced contractions. Olanzapine had high affinity (pK(i)=8.30+/-0.06) for human 5-HT(6) receptors in radioligand binding studies. Olanzapine did not stimulate [35S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding to the G protein G(s) in cells containing human 5-HT(6) receptors, but inhibited 5-HT-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding (pK(B)=7.38+/-0.16). Among other antipsychotics investigated, clozapine antagonized 5-HT(6) receptors with a pK(B)=7.42+/-0.15, ziprasidone was three-fold less potent, and risperidone, quetiapine and haloperidol were weak antagonists. Thus, olanzapine was not an agonist, but was a potent antagonist at 5-HT(6) receptors and had marked antagonism at 5-HT(3) receptors.", 
    "81": "The effects of combined and single administration of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, 7,8-methylenedioxy-1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-3-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-2,3-benzodiazepine (LY 300164), and of the GABA(B) receptor antagonist gamma-aminopropyl-n-butyl-phosphinic acid (CGP 36742), on spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges were investigated in WAG/Rij rats. LY 300164 had minor effects; only the highest dose (16 mg/kg) reduced the number of spike-wave discharges in a short time window. CGP 36742 was more effective as it significantly reduced the number of spike-wave discharges and shortened their duration at the doses of 25 and 100 mg/kg. The ED(50) values for the inhibition of spike-wave discharges by LY 300164 and CGP 36742 in a time window 30-60 min after injection were 15.5 and 16.6 mg/kg, respectively. The ED(50) of CGP 36742 was reduced to 8.0 mg/kg when this antagonist was administered in combination with LY 300164 (6 mg/kg). The interaction between the two antagonists appeared to be additive according to isobolographic analysis. Importantly, CGP 36742 and LY 300164 administered either alone or in combination had no apparent effects on behavior. These results may provide information for a rational approach to polytherapy for the treatment of generalized absence epilepsy.", 
    "82": "Although sedation is acknowledged to be one of the most common side effects of opioid analgesics, the mechanisms and characteristics of this phenomenon remain elusive, and research in this area is extremely limited. This report integrates research findings on the mechanism of action of opioids with research findings on the phenomenon of consciousness to develop a model of how opioids may act in the central nervous system to produce sedation. Based on this integration, a definition of opioid-induced sedation is proposed to encourage dialogue and research on this perplexing and clinically significant phenomenon.", 
    "83": "For years paediatric dentists have searched for the ideal sedative, that is, a drug that allows the safe control of a child's behaviour, provides adequate time to complete a procedure, and also has a quick recovery so that the patient may be discharged. Many drugs have been tried either alone or in combination, and unfortunately none has yet produced reliable results. This paper will review current philosophies in the use of conscious sedation in children. Currently, much interest has been focused on the use of midazolam, a short acting benzodiazepine. The safety of midazolam will be addressed, either when given alone or in combination with nitrous oxide. Midazolam appears to be a safe and effective drug when given in the appropriate doses. Its use in combination with nitrous oxide also appears to be effective, but certain precautions should be kept in mind. Careful patient selection, adequate informed consent, and specific clinical criteria appear to be vital for success. In general, the use of sedation in paediatric dentistry should be carried out by experienced operators in a well controlled environment.", 
    "84": "Some members of a series of novel pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines (PBOXs) potently induce apoptosis in a number of human cancerous cell lines including HL-60 cells and the drug-resistant chronic myelogenous leukaemia cell line, K562. The apoptotic induction seems to be independent of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which binds these PBOXs with high affinity, due to a lack of correlation between their affinities for the receptor and their apoptotic potencies and their high apoptotic activity in PBR-deficient cells. PBOX-6, a potent member of the series, induces a transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a dose-dependent manner, which correlates with induction of apoptosis. Expression of a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway, Jip-1, prevents JNK activity and significantly reduces the extent of apoptosis induced by PBOX-6. This demonstrates the requirement for JNK in the cellular response to this apoptotic agent. In addition, PBOX-6 activates caspase-3-like proteases in K562 and HL-60 cells. The caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-DEVD-fmk), blocks caspase-3-like protease activity in both cell types but only prevents PBOX-6-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, suggesting that the requirement for caspase-3-like proteases in the apoptotic pathway is dependent on the cell type.", 
    "85": "Hypoxemia is a commonly observed complication during the chemical immobilization of wild ruminants. If severe and left untreated, it can predispose animals to arrhythmias, organ failure, and capture myopathy. The following prospective study was designed to measure the degree of hypoxemia in wapiti that were immobilized with a combination of xylazine and tiletamine-zolazepam and to assess the response to nasal oxygen therapy. Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis were used to assess the degree of hypoxemia prior to nasal insufflation of oxygen and to demonstrate any beneficial effects of this intervention. All wapiti exhibited mild to marked hypoxemia (PaO2 = 43 +/- 11.8 mmHg) prior to treatment and showed marked improvement after 5 minutes of nasal insufflation of oxygen at 10 L/min (PaO2 = 207 +/- 60 mmHg). This inexpensive, noninvasive technique has great benefit in treating clinical hypoxemia under field conditions, and we recommend that nasal insufflation of oxygen be implemented during xylazine-tiletamine-zolazepam-induced immobilization of wapiti and other wild ruminants.", 
    "86": "The outpatient bone marrow biopsy and aspiration (BMBA) procedure performed with local anesthetic is often poorly tolerated in adults. This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was designed to determine whether oral (p.o.) lorazepam and hydromorphone reduces pain and anxiety during BMBA. Eligible patients had lymphoma, had no prior BMBA, and were > or = 18 years old. Since patients had bilateral BMBA, each served as their own control. Patients were stratified by anxiety level using the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Scale and randomized to: A) placebo for the first BMBA and 2 mg lorazepam and 2 mg hydromorphone p.o. for the contralateral BMBA, or B) placebo for both BMBAS. Changes in pain and anxiety experienced between the first and second BMBA were measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Spielberger State Anxiety Scale at the time of the BMBA and 24 hours later. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled and 25 were evaluable; there were 17 males and eight females. The median age was 57 years (range, 28-79 years). Overall, BMBA was reported as painful in both arms, with a median VAS pain score after the second BMBA of 3.9 (scale, 0-10) for arm A and 5.8 for arm B (P = 0.21). There was no difference in the change in pain, anxiety, or recalled anxiety between treatment arms (all P values > 0.05). The difference in the change in recalled pain was of borderline significance (P = 0.07) and consistent with benzodiazepine-induced anterograde amnesia.",

However, the selectivity of these drugs for decreasing ethanol self-administration relative to reducing responding maintained by other reinforcers in primates is not clear. The present study used a multiple schedule self-administration procedure in cynomolgus monkeys to examine the selectivity of naltrexone and Ro 15-4513 for reducing ethanol self-administration relative to an orange flavored sugar-free sweetened solution (Sugar-free Tang).",

The effect of acute administration of naltrexone (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg) was examined. The effect of 15 days of chronic, 1 mg/kg naltrexone on ethanol and Tang self-administration was then examined in four monkeys. Acute administration of Ro 15-4513 (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg) as well as 15 days of chronic administration of 0.1 mg/kg Ro 15-4513 was also examined in four monkeys.",

Acute naltrexone administration significantly decreased total session ethanol and Tang intake as well as the number and volume of ethanol and Tang drinks. Chronic naltrexone also significantly decreased ethanol and Tang intake. Ethanol, but not Tang, drink volume was significantly decreased by chronic 1 mg/kg naltrexone pretreatment. The number of ethanol and Tang drinks and drink duration were not significantly decreased by chronic naltrexone. Acute Ro 15-4513 pretreatment significantly decreased ethanol and Tang intake, mean drinks and median drink duration. Chronic 0.1 mg/kg Ro 15-4513 pretreatment significantly decreased total ethanol intake only during the first week of pretreatment, but it significantly decreased Tang intake for all 3 pretreatment weeks.", 
    "90": "Similar to rodent studies, acute and chronic naltrexone and Ro 15-4513 reduced ethanol and Tang intake in cynomolgus monkeys. However, unlike rodent studies, neither drug showed selectivity for reducing ethanol intake compared with a comparison reinforcer. These differences highlight the need for testing putative ethanol abuse treatment drugs under diverse conditions and multiple species before undertaking human clinical trials.", 
    "91": "The targeting of molecular abnormalities in neoplasms may provide an opportunity to improve the selectivity of cancer therapy. Ras mutations are a common genetic event in human cancers. Other genetic changes in tumors can signal through ras-dependent pathways as well. The targeting of ras through the inhibition of Ras protein farnesylation is one new cancer treatment strategy under clinical evaluation. Several farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have been evaluated in phase I trials. The toxicity and maximally tolerated doses of several FTIs have been determined, and clinical trials are underway to evaluate FTIs in combination with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. Also underway are attempts to develop assays to measure the biological effects of the FTI in patients. Inhibition of farnesylation of a number of surrogate markers are currently being investigated. These efforts may provide insight into the mechanism of action of these compounds and lead to improved patient selection for clinical trials.", 
    "92": "Olanzapine is an effective and safe antipsychotic drug. Its pharmacokinetic properties are comparable to those of classical antipsychotics. Oxidative processes are mediated by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 and to a minor degree by CYP2D6. Olanzapine's main route of metabolism is by glucuronidation. Therapeutic doses result in a wide variability of serum levels; dose and serum concentration are linearly correlated. Smoking and carbamazepine induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and thus decrease olanzapine serum levels. Inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine yields increased concentrations; however, clinically relevant CYP2D6 inhibition was observed only in combination with additional disposition factors, such as female gender or old age. As a rule dose adjustment is not necessary but moderate renal or hepatic impairment calls for control of serum levels to provide maximal safety during olanzapine therapy. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and toxicology studies are carried out by HPLC methods using UV or MS detection. The optimal therapeutic range of olanzapine serum levels is 20 to 40 ng/ml. Concentrations of 80 ng/ml are considered threshold for the occurrence of adverse events; however, toxicological studies showed that postmortem plasma levels are higher than antemortem levels. Lethality of high olanzapine was only observed in combination with other drugs. Moderate increases of prolactin levels were detected during administration of olanzapine. In relation to olanzapine therapy, several case reports of neutropenia and agranulocytosis appeared in the literature. Weight gain in olanzapine-treated patients does not correlate with serum levels. Olanzapine response is augmented when patients' serum levels are titrated to 20 to 40 ng/ml thereby minimizing the occurrence of side effects, thus TDM is recommended for patients treated with olanzapine.", 
    "93": "The particularities in the medical treatment of children, especially those concerning premature infants, new-borns and babies, do not only stem from the immaturity of the organs (kidneys, liver etc.) but also from pharmacokinetic factors which are result of the immaturity of the brain. There are maturation deficits on all levels of transmission, from the nerve with electric transmission to the synapsis with neurotransmitter propagation, even though the whole system is basically laid out. The presented paper concerns itself mainly with the ontogenesis of the receptor-systems, a small part is dedicated to the question of myelination. Number and distribution of the receptors in premature or new-born infants and babies should not only be viewed in the context of the future function in mature humans (i.e. transmission and modification of information) - the receptors themselves are important factors in the maturing process of neuronal pathways, synapses and the differentiation of the neuronal cells themselves. Basically the number of receptors can change as follows: 1. Continuous increase until maturity, 2. Increase to a maximum during maturation with slight or stronger decrease after, 3. High initial number with following distinct decrease, 4. Even number throughout maturation, 5. Passing expression during maturation. The aim of this paper is to present an overview on the ontogenesis of opioid-, NMDA-, GABA-, dopamine-, acetylcholine- and serotoninreceptors. The data derived from animal and human-pharmacological experiments will be used to carefully conclude how the particularities of drug reactions of children (i.e. increased respiratory depression after opioid application in premature and newborn infants, higher incidence of paradox reactions to benzodiazepines etc.) can be explained.", 
    "94": "The aims of the present study were (1) to investigate and quantify the pharmacokinetics, including inter-occasion variability and covariate relationships, of busulphan in BMT patients and (2) to develop a user-friendly initial dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) strategy for the treatment of those patients with busulphan. The pharmacokinetics of busulphan was studied in 64 adults and 12 children who received busulphan (1 mg/kg) four times daily for 4 days. A one-compartment model with first order absorption and a lag time was sufficient in describing the concentration-time profile. Oral clearance (CL/F) was found to be correlated to weight (+1.2%/kg), ALT (-13%/microcat/l) and concomitant phenytoin treatment (+21%). CL/F and the volume of distribution (V/F) were estimated to 9.23 l/h and 39.3 l, respectively, in a typical individual. Inter-occasion variability (9.4%) in CL/F was estimated to be less than inter-individual variability (28%), a prerequisite for the value of TDM. Bayesian CL/F estimates based on three samples were in good accordance with those based on all samples. The final population model was implemented into the program Excel. The resulting flexible and easy to use dosing program might be used for both initial and, requiring only three plasma samples, maintenance dose individualization of busulphan therapy.", 
    "95": "1. The influence of membrane cholesterol on some pharmacological properties of the GABA(A) receptor was investigated in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal neurones with whole cell patch clamp recording. The cholesterol levels were varied between 56% and 235% control using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin as the cholesterol carrier. 2. Enrichment of neurones with cholesterol increased the effects of the non-steroidal GABA potentiators propofol, flunitrazepam and pentobarbitone. A similar result was obtained after pre-incubation of neurones with epicholesterol, the 3alpha-hydroxy isomer of cholesterol. 3. In contrast, the effects of the steroidal GABA potentiators pregnanolone and alfaxalone were reduced by cholesterol enrichment, but not by epicholesterol. Depletion of membrane cholesterol increased the potentiation of GABA by pregnanolone and alfaxalone but did not affect the non-steroidal potentiators. 4. The steroidal antagonist of GABA, pregnenolone sulphate, reduced the maximum response to GABA. This effect, also, was diminished in cholesterol-enriched neurones and enhanced in cholesterol-depleted neurones. 5. The effects of the cholesterol manipulations that were selective for the steroidal modulators of GABA are suggested to arise from direct interactions between membrane cholesterol and the GABA(A) receptor. The separate effects on the non-steroidal potentiators of GABA of cholesterol-enrichment or addition of epicholesterol to the neurones are suggested to be due to changes in membrane fluidity. 6. In view of the likely physiological modulation of GABA(A) receptors by endogenous neuroactive steroids and evidence of the in vivo lability of membrane cholesterol, the present observations may have physiological as well as pharmacological relevance.",

We also studied the dose dependency of the effect of DBI on the intake of 5% sucrose. Injection of DBI in excess of 3 microg suppressed the intake of 5% sucrose in mice. Furthermore, injection of DBI (i.c.v.) increased the aversive response to 0.9% NaCl in the taste reactivity in mice. These results suggest that DBI affect the preference to food.",

Plasma concentrations of diazepam and metabolites differed between the strains with the Harlan-Fischer rats showing higher diazepam concentrations. 5-HT levels in discrete brain regions varied with Harlan-Fischer rats having higher 5-HT concentrations.

The drug was 3H labeled and melanin granules from cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, were used according to the suggested standard for melanin studies. We observed a rapid Langmuir-like binding followed by a slower diffusion-limited binding that may be interpreted as an initial surface binding followed by deeper bulk binding. From three concentrations of melanin, with a 60-min incubation time, a mean saturation value of 180 +/- 20 pmol/mg was calculated. The binding of a group of benzodiazepines and tranquilizers was compared to the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam by means of displacement experiments. These drugs showed binding characteristics similar to [3H]flunitrazepam except phenobarbital, which had a lower affinity to melanin. The method presented in this study allowed measurements with low melanin and drug concentrations and it has the strength of directly measuring the amount of drug bound to melanin, in contrast to previous indirect methods.",

    "125": "Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is a psychotropic agent that has shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder. Olanzapine has a multireceptorial binding profile including a greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT(2A) than for dopamine D(2) receptors. Olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day demonstrated significantly greater antimanic efficacy than placebo in two double-blind, randomised 3- or 4-week trials of patients with bipolar I disorder of either manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features. Additionally, in one of these trials, improvements in cognitive function and hostility were superior with olanzapine. In cohorts of severely depressed and rapid cycling patients, improvements in manic and depressive symptoms and in manic symptoms only, were superior with olanzapine compared with placebo. Significant improvements from baseline in symptoms of mania, depression, cognitive functioning and hostility were seen with olanzapine in a 49-week extension phase study. In double-blind trials, olanzapine 10 mg/day appeared to have similar antimanic efficacy to oral lithium 400mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with pure mania (4-week small study). In patients with acute manic or mixed episodes olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day appeared to be more effective than oral valproate semisodium (divalproex sodium) 500 to 2500 mg/day (3-week study) and at least as effective as oral haloperidol 3 to 15 mg/day (12-week study). Preliminary results from a large 6-week placebo-controlled study suggest that olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day in combination with mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate semisodium) provides effective augmentation of antimanic treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder, with benefits seen in the first week. Adverse events reported significantly more often with olanzapine than with placebo were somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness and bodyweight gain, and in comparison with valproate semisodium were somnolence, dry mouth, increased appetite and bodyweight gain. Olanzapine was generally well tolerated with no clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory tests, vital signs or electrocardiogram results.",

According to preliminary data the antimanic efficacy of olanzapine appears similar to that of haloperidol and better than that of valproate semisodium in patients with bipolar I disorder experiencing a manic or mixed episode; among nonpsychotic patients with manic or mixed episodes olanzapine appears to be superior to haloperidol. Available data support the choice of olanzapine as an option in the short-term management of mania in patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features.",

It is important to differentiate SB from other normal sleep orofacial activities and concomitant sleep disorders. Other orofacial activities may obscure the diagnosis of SB and may give an ambiguous clinical picture when evaluating treatment efficacy. Laboratory recordings provide a more specific diagnosis. Most of the clinical signs (e.g., tooth wear, masseter hypertrophy) are not exclusive to SB but could be concomitant with other habits or activities during wakefulness. No pathologic features in the central nervous system, such as a dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, have been observed in SB patients. Recent neurophysiologic studies have suggested that SB is a powerful microarousal event associated with central and autonomic nervous system activity during sleep. The additive contribution of psychosocial stress cannot be overlooked. There have been no recent major breakthroughs in SB management. Cognitive and behavioral managements, which include stress management, lifestyle changes, or improved coping mechanisms, may be beneficial. Oral splint appliances are useful to protect teeth from damage. A few medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants) may be helpful for a short-term period, particularly when there is secondary pain, but controlled studies are needed to assess their efficacy, safety, and patient acceptance and tolerance.",

The objective was to evaluate the safety of nalmefene in children. An open-label pediatric clinical trial was performed. The study was conducted at the emergency department of an urban, university-affiliated children's hospital and consisted of children aged 6 months to 12 years who required procedural sedation where an opioid agent was administered. Patients were excluded if there was altered mental status, history of head trauma, history of opioid allergy, or the anticipated need for opioid agents for pain relief after the procedure. At the completion of the procedure, nalmefene was administered in a dose of 0.25 microg/kg increments (max 10 microg) until sedation was resolved, or to a maximum of 1.0 microg/kg (max 40 microg). Serial ECGs, vital signs, and oxygen saturation were recorded. Sedation was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS) at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 minutes after the initial nalmefene dose. The observer's assessment of alertness and sedation (OAA/S) was measured at baseline, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the first dose of nalmefene. Episodes of resedation were recorded. All patients received follow-up by telephone at 4 and 24 hours after the initial dose of nalmefene to identify any potential late adverse effects. Over the study interval 15 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 59.1 +/- 41.5 months. Procedures involved fracture reduction (n=8), laceration repair (n = 4), abscess drainage (n = 2), and arthrocentesis (n = 1). All patients received IV fentanyl and midazolam. The mean dosage of fentanyl and midazolam was 3.21 +/- 1.03 microg/kg and 0.07 +/- 0.03 mg/kg, respectively. The mean dose of nalmefene at the time of complete response (CGIS = 1 or 2) was 0.55 +/- 0.29 microg/kg. The median number of nalmefene doses was 2. All but one patient (93%) had a complete response based on CGIS at 10 minutes after the initial dose of nalmefene was given. Nalmefene resulted in a significant improvement in CGIS (1.60 +/- 0.82 v 3.26 +/- 0.88, P =.001) and OAA/S (median score 5 v 4) when compared at baseline with 10 minutes after the initial dose of nalmefene. Nalmefene also resulted in increased diastolic blood pressure (62.6 +/- 10.5 v 55.8 +/- 10.7, P =.04) as well as improved oxygen saturation when compared at 120 minutes to baseline (99.5 +/- 0.74% v 98.5 +/- 0.4%, P =.03). There were no significant changes in pulse, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and ECG. None of the patients became resedated after nalmefene was given. One patient developed nausea and vomiting within the first 2 hours after nalmefene; this resolved without intervention before discharge.

    "145": "Modern strategies for preventing or controlling pain and anxiety demand a premedication for operations using local anesthesia and for those using sedation or general anesthesia. For optimal patient care, the premedication should be given orally and, with respect to the outpatient basis of the operations, should have a short recovery period. Midazolam, one of the most favored premedications for general anesthesia, has been recommended as a premedication for operations using local anesthesia as well. However, midazolam has only sedative-anxiolytic effects and does not reduce pain sensation, which should be mandatory for operations using local anesthesia. A further requirement is the maintenance of stable hemodynamics for the prevention of postoperative hematomas, especially in the face. For these reasons, another premedication meeting all requirements (anxiolysis, analgesia, and stable hemodynamics) was researched. A randomized, double-blind prospective study was performed from March of 1997 to June of 1998. Five groups totalling 150 patients were included in the study; each group contained 30 patients who had operations performed solely on the face. In the first four groups, the effect of midazolam (0.15 mg/kg(-1)), morphine (0.3 mg/kg(-1)), and clonidine (1.5 microg/kg(-1)) administered orally was compared with a placebo. The fifth group was the control group and received no premedication. To evaluate the effects of the premedications, a corresponding questionnaire was completed independently by the patient and surgeon. With regard to the anxiolytic or analgesic properties of the premedication, 61 percent of the patients preferred pain reduction to anxiety control, and 24 percent of patients preferred reduction of anxiety. The remainder insisted on a reduction of both properties (8 percent) or had no preference (7 percent). Reduction of anxiety was largest in the midazolam and the clonidine groups, but the difference was not significant. The least pain during the application of local anesthesia was experienced by the morphine group (37 percent) and the clonidine group (33 percent), in contrast to the midazolam group (60 percent) (p = 0.04). Morphine and clonidine met the requirements of pain reduction equally well. Nevertheless, considering the rate and intensity of adverse effects with respect to hemodynamic compromises, nausea, and emesis, clonidine is even better suited as an oral premedication for operations on the face using local anesthesia.", 
    "146": "Gene-targeting techniques to produce null mutations provide a powerful method for evaluating the contribution of particular candidate genes involved in motivation. The embryonic stem cell lines in which homologous recombination is undertaken are derived from 129 mice, but because of the impoverished performance of 129 mice on a number of behavioral tasks, mice chimeric for the mutation are often bred with a C57BL/6 mouse strain. Thus, an examination of both parental strains is important in the study of the knock-out mice. Although the C57BL/6 behavioral phenotype is well documented, details of the 129 phenotype have not been the focus of study until recently. We investigated opiate motivation in both 129/SvJ and C57BL/6J mouse strains to determine whether, and under what circumstances, the 129/SvJ mouse exhibited motivated behavior toward opiates. 129/SvJ mice required both drug and contextual cues to demonstrate morphine conditioned place preferences on test day, whereas C57BL/6J mice required only contextual cues to express opiate place conditioning. Pentobarbital and diazepam but not saline, cocaine, or naloxone could substitute for morphine on test day in 129/SvJ mice, demonstrating that morphine indeed has rewarding motivational valence in the 129/SvJ mouse strain. This critical, interoceptive cue in 129/SvJ mice on test day may be the anxiolytic properties of the effective drugs. Therefore, some deficits observed in 129 mice and mice harboring this genetic background may be attributed to high levels of anxiety during the retrieval period rather than to sensory, learning, or motivational deficits.", 
    "147": "Synaptic inhibition in the thalamus plays critical roles in sensory processing and thalamocortical rhythm generation. To determine kinetic, pharmacological, and structural properties of thalamic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors, we used patch-clamp techniques and single-cell reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in neurons from two principal rat thalamic nuclei-the reticular nucleus (nRt) and the ventrobasal (VB) complex. Single-channel recordings identified GABA(A) channels with densities threefold higher in VB than nRt neurons, and with mean open time fourfold longer for nRt than VB [14.6 +/- 2.5 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.7 (SE) ms, respectively]. GABA(A) receptors in nRt and VB cells were pharmacologically distinct. Zn(2+) (100 microM) reduced GABA(A) channel activity in VB and nRt by 84 and 24%, respectively. Clonazepam (100 nM) increased inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) decay time constants in nRt (from 44.3 to 77.9 ms, P < 0.01) but not in VB. Single-cell RT-PCR revealed subunit heterogeneity between nRt and VB cells. VB neurons expressed alpha1-alpha3, alpha5, beta1-3, gamma2-3, and delta, while nRt cells expressed alpha3, alpha5, gamma2-3, and delta. Both cell types expressed more subunits than needed for a single receptor type, suggesting the possibility of GABA(A) receptor heterogeneity within individual thalamic neurons. beta subunits were not detected in nRt cells, which is consistent with very low levels reported in previous in situ hybridization studies but inconsistent with the expected dependence of functional GABA(A) receptors on beta subunits. Different single-channel open times likely underlie distinct IPSC decay time constants in VB and nRt cells. While we can make no conclusion regarding beta subunits, our findings do support alpha subunits, possibly alpha1 versus alpha3, as structural determinants of channel deactivation kinetics and clonazepam sensitivity. As the gamma2 and delta subunits previously implicated in Zn(2+) sensitivity are both expressed in each cell type, the observed differential Zn(2+) actions at VB versus nRt GABA(A) receptors may involve other subunit differences.", 
    "148": "In many vertebrate CNS synapses, the neurotransmitter glutamate activates postsynaptic non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and NMDA receptors. Since their biophysical properties are quite different, the time course of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) depends largely on the relative contribution of their activation. To investigate whether the activation of the two receptor subtypes is affected by the synaptic interaction in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the mouse retina, we analyzed the properties of the light-evoked responses of ON-cone bipolar cells and ON-transient amacrine cells in a retinal slice preparation. ON-transient amacrine cells were whole cell voltage-clamped, and the glutamatergic synaptic input from bipolar cells was isolated by a cocktail of pharmacological agents (bicuculline, strychnine, curare, and atropine). Direct puff application of NMDA revealed the presence of functional NMDA receptors. However, the light-evoked EPSC was not significantly affected by D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), but suppressed by 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) or 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466). These results indicate that the light-evoked EPSC is mediated mainly by AMPA receptors under this condition. Since bipolar cells have GABA(C) receptors at their terminals, it has been suggested that bipolar cells receive feedback inhibition from amacrine cells. Application of (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA), a specific blocker of GABA(C) receptors, suppressed both the GABA-induced current and the light-evoked feedback inhibition observed in ON-cone bipolar cells and enhanced the light-evoked EPSC of ON-transient amacrine cells. In the presence of TPMPA, the light-evoked EPSC of amacrine cells was composed of AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated components. Our results suggest that photoresponses of ON-transient amacrine cells in the mouse retina are modified by the activation of presynaptic GABA(C) receptors, which may control the extent of glutamate spillover.",

Blood samples were collected serially from 0 to 36 hours. Noncompartmental methods were used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters. Lorazepam was well absorbed following intranasal administration with a mean (%CV) bioavailability of 77.7(11.1). Intranasal administration resulted in a faster absorption rate than intramuscular administration. Elimination profiles were comparable between all three routes. The concentration-time profile for intranasal delivery demonstrated evidence of a double peak in several subjects, suggesting partial oral absorption.

These agents have disadvantages such as sedation, risk of respiratory insufficiency, and cardiovascular complications as well as addictive potential. Alternatively, it could be demonstrated that both tiapride (TIA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) are efficient in the treatment of AWS with less toxicity. However, they seem to be less effective in AWS than CLO as single agents. But no systematic comparison of the combination of TIA and CBZ against an established therapeutic standard can be found in the literature. Therefore, we compared the combination of TIA and CBZ with CLO in two open exploratory studies with matched samples. Outcome parameters were heart rate, blood pressure, complications, withdrawal symptoms (CIWA-Ar scale), and general clinical state (CGI scale). A retrospective evaluation of medical records (30 TIA+CBZ, 30 CLO) was followed by an open prospective study (40 TIA+CBZ, 40 CLO). Both studies revealed similar efficacy in terms of psychopathologic and vegetative symptoms. Vegetative recovery seems to be faster with TIA+CBZ.

    "162": "We sought to determine the influence of preoperative oral midazolam on: (i) measures of anaesthetic emergence; (ii) recovery times and (iii) intraoperative bispectral index (BIS) measurements during sevoflurane/N2O anaesthesia in paediatric patients.", 
    "163": "Fifty-two patients, aged 1-10 years, ASA I-II, were enrolled in a prospective double-blinded study. Patients were randomized to receive either midazolam 0.5 mg.kg(-1) (M) or midazolam vehicle (P) as premedication. After inhalation induction and intubation, expired sevoflurane was stabilized at 3% in 60% N2O and the corresponding BIS (BIS I) recorded. At the completion of surgery, sevoflurane was stabilized at 0.5% and the BIS (BIS E) again recorded. Awakening time, expired sevoflurane/N2O awakening concentrations and recovery times were recorded.", 
    "164": "There were no significant differences between groups in awakening time, sevoflurane or N2O awakening concentrations, time to PACU discharge, time to hospital discharge or in BIS I and BIS E measurements.", 
    "165": "The purpose of this audit was the evaluation of recovery and discharge times and the identification of perioperative events related to anaesthetics with intravenous ketamine and midazolam.", 
    "166": "In our institution, we use this method as a routine technique for short ambulatory emergency or elective procedures. Two hundred children, aged 1-16 years, were included. Ninety percent of the study patients underwent emergency procedures.", 
    "167": "Most perioperative events were minor and easily corrected. Intraoperatively, most events were related to respiration, including oxygen desaturation, apnoea or laryngospasm. Vomiting, vertigo, visual disturbances, nightmares and hallucinations were observed in the postoperative period. Serious complications requiring hospital admission or further interventions in the postoperative period were rare. Mean recovery time was 100 min (range 20-325) and mean discharge time 130 min (range 25-360).", 
    "168": "Intravenous ketamine plus midazolam is a suitable, simple and fast anaesthetic technique for short, painful ambulatory procedures. Considering the possibility of potentially serious respiratory complications, it should be performed only by qualified anaesthesia staff who are trained in advanced airway management."
