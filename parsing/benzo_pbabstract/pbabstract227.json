    "0": "To compare expected outcomes and costs of care in patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders who are treated with risperidone versus olanzapine.", 
    "1": "A Markov model was developed to examine outcomes and costs of care in patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders receiving risperidone or olanzapine. The time frame of interest was 1 year. The model focused particular attention on the likelihood of therapy switching and discontinuation as a result of treatment-emergent side effects, as the efficacy of these two agents is similar. Measures of interest included the incidence of relapse and selected side effects including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), prolactin-related disorders and diabetes, expected change in body weight, and the percentage of patients remaining on initial therapy at the end of 1 year. Costs of antipsychotic therapy and psychiatric and nonpsychiatric services also were examined.", 
    "2": "At 1 year, the rate of EPS was estimated to be slightly higher for risperidone, as was the incidence of symptomatic prolactin-related disorders. The expected incidence of diabetes mellitus, while low, was slightly higher for olanzapine. Approximately 25% and 4% of olanzapine and risperidone patients, respectively, were projected to experience an increase in body weight > or = 7%. The estimated percentage of patients remaining on initial therapy at the end of 1 year was higher for risperidone than olanzapine (76.9% vs. 45.6%, respectively). Expected mean total costs of care per month of therapy were $2163 for risperidone and $2316 for olanzapine. Results from sensitivity analyses suggest that the probability of therapy discontinuation following weight gain >5 kg would have to be lower than 0.1 for the number of patients remaining on therapy at the end of 1 year to be the same for risperidone and olanzapine.", 
    "3": "Compared with risperidone, treatment with olanzapine may result in greater increases in body weight, higher rates of therapy discontinuation, and higher costs of medical-care services.", 
    "4": "To evaluate the acceptability of intranasal midazolam (INM) in acute seizure management in the community.", 
    "5": "Parents and staff in residential and educational settings were trained in first aid and seizure management and the administration of INM. Feedback was obtained from those who had given INM over the 30-month period September 2000-March 2003.", 
    "6": "Intranasal midazolam was administered to 22 children for a total of 54 seizures (range 1-6 seizures each). The dose was 0.2-0.3 mg/kg rounded down to 1 or 2 of the 5 mg in 1-mL plastic ampoules, with the anticonvulsant instilled into the child's nose directly from the plastic ampoule. Seizures were effectively stopped on 48 occasions, i.e. 89%, while no respiratory arrests occurred. Thirty carers had given INM to a convulsing child and 27 (90%) reported no difficulty in administering it. Fifteen people had also previously administered rectal diazepam and INM was considered easier to administer than rectal diazepam by 13 while a preference to use INM rather than rectal diazepam was indicated by 14.", 
    "7": "This study has shown that INM is an acceptable treatment option as a first aid response for acute seizures. We believe that INM should be considered as the preferred alternative in the community setting, as it is easier to administer and is more dignified for the patient than rectal diazepam.", 
    "8": "Recent advances in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have increased the number of treatment options for anxiety disorders. This article examines changes in outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders in the United States between 1987 and 1999.", 
    "9": "Analyses are presented of service utilization data from 2 nationally representative surveys of the general population: the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey and the 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Respondents were selected who made 1 or more outpatient visits for the treatment of an anxiety disorder (ICD-9/DSM-IV: 300.0, 300.2, 300.3, or 308.3). The rates of treatment, psychotropic medication use, psychotherapy, number of outpatient treatment visits, type of provider, and source of payment were determined.", 
    "10": "The rate of outpatient treatment for anxiety disorders increased from 0.43 per 100 persons in 1987 to 0.83 in 1999 (p <.001). Among those treated for an anxiety disorder, the proportion that received psychotropic medications increased from 52.1% to 69.9% (p =.008). Among treated patients, antidepressant use increased from 18.3% to 44.9% (p <.0001), while use of benzodiazepines (42.3% to 31.7%, p =.09) and psychotherapy (60.5% to 48.0%, p =.07) tended to decline. A decreasing proportion of mean treatment expenditures was covered by self-payment (53.2% to 31.5%, p <.0001).", 
    "11": "Between 1987 and 1999, there was an increase in the proportion of the population who received outpatient treatment for anxiety disorders. Among patients receiving care, treatment became characterized by greater use of psychotropic medications, especially antidepressant medications, with nonsignificant trends toward less common use of psychotherapy.", 
    "12": "Non-cognitive disorders and behavioral disturbances in dementia syndromes are the domain of antidepressants and neuroleptic agents. At the present time, neuroleptics are being prescribed too often and antidepressants too rarely. The choice of antidepressant depends upon whether a sedative effect is desired. Although caution is advised when increasing the dose, the target dose does not differ from that for young adults. Neuroleptics should always be administered in the lowest effective dose. In principle, the modern atypical substances should be preferred to the classical neuroleptics. Restraint should be exercised with the prescription of benzodiazepines in patients with dementia.", 
    "13": "When no organic etiology can be determined for recurrent somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis might be the logical conclusion. However, the primary care physician should be alerted to the possibility of panic disorder if the patient presents with recurrent panic attacks, concern, and worry about having another attack and its consequences, and avoidance of certain places, situations, or activities which comprise the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. A comprehensive treatment program for panic disorder includes the integration of pharmacotherapy (SSRIs and benzodiazepines), cognitive-behavior therapy, and psychotherapy. In most cases, the primary care physician can successfully treat panic disorder.", 
    "14": "Major contributions to the investigation of the influence of drugs on driving ability come from experimental studies as apart from epidemiological studies. Regarding experimental studies, the results of a single study are essentially determined by the experimental design. An established assessment of the risk of a drug in regard to driving ability should not be based on either a single study or on synopses, which record only a few studies without detailed information. This article presents an overview of published studies that directly or indirectly deal with the influence of flunitrazepam on driving ability. Benzodiazepines in particular, and amongst these especially flunitrazepam are brought into connection with the impairment of driving ability. This approach emphasises differences regarding the dosages used, the experimental designs and the methods of testing. For reasons of clarity the article on flunitrazepam is subdivided into the topics of acute effects, residual effects, and effects after subchronic application. Different results are reported. A statistical analysis in terms of a meta-analysis was not carried out due to a lack of standardization of the studies.", 
    "15": "Neurodegeneration induced by excitotoxicity is a common feature in various neurological disorders. This pathological condition is caused by prolonged stimulation of glutamate receptor subtypes, followed by both intracellular Ca2+ overload and activation of specific genes, resulting in synthesis of enzymes involved in cell stress response. Using experimental in vitro models of excitotoxicity, we demonstrated that glutamate exposure up-regulated tissue transglutaminase in primary cultures of both cerebellar granule cells and astrocytes. These changes were consequent to receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx, as demonstrated by the inhibition with selective antagonists, MK-801 and GYKI 52466. Early increases in different transglutaminase isoforms were also observed in global cerebral ischemia, which closely resembles neuronal damage caused by NMDA receptor activation. These findings agree with a postulated role for transglutaminases in molecular mechanisms of several neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, increased cross-linking reactions could be of pathologic relevance, as part of biochemical changes observed in neurological disorders.", 
    "16": "Paradoxical hyperactivity (PH) is a known complication of sedation in children, especially with barbiturates such as pentobarbital. The accompanying inconsolable irritability and agitation, similar to behaviors reported in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is uncomfortable for the child and anxiety-provoking for parents and health-care workers. Our objective was to describe our experience with oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) caffeine as a treatment for sedation-induced PH.", 
    "17": "From January 2000 to April 2003, 19,894 children were sedated in our institution for radiology procedures. Of these, 360 children were diagnosed with PH. A total of 229 children exhibiting symptoms of PH after sedative administration were treated with PO caffeine ( n=88; 43 boys, 45 girls; mean age 4.5 years, mean weight 18.7 kg) or IV caffeine ( n=131; 73 boys, 58 girls; mean age 4.8 years, mean weight 20.1 kg) or both ( n=10; 8 boys, 2 girls; mean age 5.0 years, mean weight 19.9 kg). A positive effect was defined as a decrease in agitation, crying, or hyperactivity within 40 min of caffeine administration. A control group ( n=45) was obtained from those 141 children who experienced post-sedation PH but were not treated with caffeine, and matched for age and sex with samples of children treated with IV caffeine ( n=45) and PO caffeine ( n=45).", 
    "18": "Children treated intravenously received the equivalent of 20 mg/kg caffeine citrate (to a maximum of 200 mg). Of those treated with IV caffeine, 82/131 (63%) showed a positive effect, and returned to baseline behavioral status after an average of 33 min (SD=23 min). The untreated control group required a significantly longer time to recover ( P<0.01) than those treated with IV caffeine. Children treated orally received approximately 1.0-2.5 mg/kg caffeine in Mountain Dew (Pepsi-Cola Company), and 36/88 (41%) showed a positive effect and returned to baseline behavioral status after an average of 42 min (SD=27 min). Of the 10 children treated with both PO and IV caffeine, 6 showed a positive effect. There was no significant difference in recovery time between the untreated control group and either the matched orally treated group or the group treated with both IV and PO caffeine. No complications occurred after caffeine administration.", 
    "19": "IV caffeine appears to be an effective treatment for PH in children with sedation-induced PH. Further controlled prospective study is needed to determine the optimum dose and route of administration and to compare efficacy with other potential drug classes.", 
    "20": "The antipsychotic agent clozapine has been linked to several cases of pancreatitis. The newer, but related, olanzapine was believed to have fewer side effects.", 
    "21": "A 42-year-old man in good physical condition gradually developed hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, diabetes and, ultimately, acute pancreatitis after 19 months of olanzapine monotherapy. Due to multiorgan failure, he was in the intensive care unit and surgical ward for 29 days. He made a full recovery. The olanzapine was discontinued. Glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels normalized as did pancreas and liver function.", 
    "22": "We report olanzapine as the probable cause of acute pancreatitis in a patient without any known predisposing factors. Olanzapine-treated patients should be monitored with glucose, lipid, pancreatic function and liver function tests, and the olanzapine should be discontinued if the results of these tests worsen.", 
    "23": "Higher levels of cognition, such as executive functions, are known to be disrupted in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. As a potential model of executive function, rats were trained in a three-lever operant conditioning chamber to respond on two of the three levers in one of six possible correct sequences. When the rat completed a two-response sequence correctly for 10 consecutive trials, the correct sequence was randomly changed to another two-response sequence without signaling the rat. Rats readily acquired the behavioral baseline and completed all six response-sequences within a 60-min session. Phencyclidine, MK-801 ((5S,10R)-(+)-5-Methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine), apomorphine, scopolamine and triazolam all produced dose-related decreases in the total number of sequences completed. Phencyclidine and MK-801 markedly increased all errors while scopolamine produced modest increases; triazolam increased only total and intrarule errors, while apomorphine had no significant effect on errors. The present results suggest that within-session repeated acquisition of response sequences has the potential to be a useful model for studying executive function in rats.", 
    "24": "To explore the status of the psychotropic medication in persons with mental retardation 6 years after their deinstitutionalization.", 
    "25": "The authors compared the profiles of psychotropic medication of 60 persons with mental retardation deinstitutionalized (D-sample) from our local mental hospital 6 years ago, to their actual pharmacological profile. Later, we compared our results to the ones of persons with mental retardation on an in-patient (In-sample) unit where existed a concerted team effort to lower the medication when deemed appropriate.", 
    "26": "Six years post-deinstitutionalization, the authors observed that the same percentage of patients remained on antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication in our D-sample, and a threefold increase of those using antidepressive medication. However, we observe a general decrease of all types of psychotropic medication in the In-sample with complete withdrawal in a substantial number of patients.", 
    "27": "The authors take these pilot data to mean that a concerted team effort at lowering medication in persons with mental retardation makes a significant difference. The possibility of other factors (age, sex, severity of mental retardation, psychiatric diagnosis) explaining the difference in the results is discussed.", 
    "28": "To evaluate the safety and tolerability of olanzapine in the treatment of elderly patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "29": "A total of 135 outpatients with schizophrenia > or =60 years of age were treated with olanzapine (n = 105) or another antipsychotic (n = 30) and followed up for 6 months. Safety measures included the recording of spontaneous adverse events and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Clinical status and effectiveness of the medications were measured using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and the Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scales. Quality of life was assessed by means of the Spanish version of the EuroQol. The Awad scale was applied to evaluate patients' subjective attitude towards medication.", 
    "30": "The incidence of overall adverse events and EPS was non-significantly lower in patients treated with olanzapine than in patients treated with other antipsychotics. The use of anticholinergic drugs was significantly lower (P = 0.04) in patients treated with olanzapine. Both groups of patients experienced similar improvements in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and GAF scores. Non-significantly greater improvement in the acceptance of medication occurred at endpoint in olanzapine-treated patients than in control patients as measured by the Awad scale. The improvement in the EuroQol quality of life scale achieved at the end of study did not differ between both treatment groups.", 
    "31": "Results from this naturalistic study showed that olanzapine was as safe and effective as other antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of elderly patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "32": "The aim of this study was to investigate the postmortem changes of concentrations of triazolam and diazepam in the rat model and to confirm the factor causing the phenomenon. We administered triazolam or diazepam orally to rats and then sacrificed them 1 h after administration. Abdominal tissues including stomach content and small intestine, thigh muscle and heart blood were collected at 0, 12, 24 h after death, and postmortem changes of the two drug concentrations were compared. Drug concentrations in the samples were analyzed by a selected ion monitoring of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Gastrointestinal postmortem concentrations of triazolam and diazepam decreased. On the other hand, the drug concentrations in the liver and kidney increased markedly, and those in lung and heart blood increased slightly during postmortem periods by diffusion from the gastrointestinal tract. The patterns of both drug concentration changes were similar. However, the extent of the triazolam increase tended to be larger than that of diazepam. This difference may be accounted for by lower triazolam concentrations before death. The postmortem drug concentrations of thigh muscle did not change when administered with triazolam and diazepam. For both triazolam and diazepam, a significant correlation was observed in the drug concentration between the small intestine and the kidney at 24 h after death, indicating that major cause of the change in the drug concentration in the kidney was diffusion from the small intestine up to 24 h after death. The results in this study indicate that diazepam as well as triazolam diffuses from the gastrointestinal tract into the surrounding tissues after death and suggest that the diffusion is influenced by their pharmaceutical properties before death.", 
    "33": "Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) ingestion is an uncommon cause of poisoning worldwide. To date, no cases of renal impairment after oral intake of DDT in humans have been reported. We describe the clinical course and management of two patients presenting after DDT ingestion, one of whom developed acute oliguric renal failure.", 
    "34": "A father and son mistook DDT powder for flour while preparing fish for a meal, and after eating they developed symptoms compatible with acute organochlorine insecticide poisoning. Both were intubated endotracheally due to recurrent convulsions and loss of consciousness followed by admission to the intensive care unit. Both cases developed severe metabolic acidosis. Acute oliguric renal failure (ARF) was diagnosed in the son in the second day, with a blood urea nitrogen level of 47 mg/dl and creatinine 6.4 mg/dl. Urinalysis disclosed abundant RBCs on the third day. Vigorous fluid resuscitation and strict monitoring helped reverse its clinical course by the tenth day. Both patients recovered within two weeks and were discharged without sequelae.", 
    "35": "Clinicians should not overlook the possibility of DDT poisoning in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure and seizures. More strict measures should be taken to prohibit misidentification of DDT and similar products, particularly in the developing world.", 
    "36": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by disruptions in multiple major neurotransmitters. While many studies have attempted to establish whether GABA is disrupted in AD patients, findings have varied. We review evidence for disruptions in GABA among patients with AD and suggest that the variable findings reflect subtypes of the disease that are possibly manifested clinically by differing behavioural symptoms. GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, has long been a target for anxiolytics, hypnotic sedatives, and anticonvulsants. We review the clinical use of GABAergic agents in treating persons with AD symptoms. While newer generation GABAergic medications are now available, they have yet to be evaluated among patients with AD.", 
    "37": "Patients with end-stage dementia typically are very immobilized. Could this state actually be a form of lorazepam-responsive catatonia? Catatonia has been documented following cerebrovascular accidents, head injury, HIV encephalitis, brain tumors, and multiple sclerosis. Identified anatomical substrates include frontal lobes, parietal lobes, limbic system, diencephalon, and basal ganglia. Given that Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinsonian dementia often have degeneration in some of the same areas, dramatic awakenings might be possible by giving lorazepam challenges to locked-in dementia patients. If even a small percentage were lorazepam responders, the impact worldwide would be tremendous. Serious consideration should be given to undertaking large-scale clinical trials.", 
    "38": "Alcohol and benzodiazepine misuse is a significant problem in older women for a number of reasons such as physiological changes, outdated prescribing practices, and failure to identify hazardous use. In addition, treatment barriers involving the health-care system, conflicting information, and ageism also exist. Substance misuse among older women is predicted to become a bigger problem as the baby boom generation ages. Brief interventions that consist of assessment, feedback, responsibility, advice, menu, empathy, and self-efficacy, or A-FRAMES, have the potential to reduce alcohol and benzodiazepine misuse among older women in a cost-effective manner.", 
    "39": "Primary generalized dystonia (PGD) associated with the early-onset generalized dystonia gene (DYT1) can cause severe disability, compromising an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living. Pharmacological treatment has been inadequate in alleviating the motor dysfunctions. Deep brain stimulation of the bilateral globus pallidus internus (DBS B-GPi) has been documented to reduce these debilitating motor abnormalities. This report details the successful treatment of a DYT1-positive 13 year-old boy suffering from PGD.", 
    "40": "We report the case of a euglycaemic woman whose glucose control rapidly decompensated following olanzapine initiation leading to diabetic coma. Hyperglycaemia has been associated with chronic psychotic disorders and antipsychotics for many years. However, it is unusual to see such rapid and life-threatening changes associated with treatment. The case highlights that changes in antipsychotic treatment may be associated with large changes in glucose tolerance, and that it is possible to continue antipsychotic treatment with appropriate diabetic care.", 
    "41": "Although demonstrating superior efficacy in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine may cause serious side effects, requires blood monitoring and is costly to administer. Olanzapine is similar to clozapine in molecular structure and pharmacologic action but has not demonstrated as robust results as clozapine at routine doses (10-25 mg). Here we present a case study measuring blood flow by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for a patient treated sequentially with a high dose of olanzapine (50 mg/day) followed by clozapine each for 8 weeks in a double-blind design. During a task, clozapine produced more brain activation patterns than during treatment with olanzapine or during the drug free condition (2 week washout). Clozapine resulted in recruitment of frontal, parietal and cingulate regions that did not appear to be active during olanzapine in this 44 year old right handed male. Additionally, a more robust decrease in symptoms was noted on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score than with olanzapine treatment. These findings suggest that high doses of olanzapine do not produce similar brain activation patterns as clozapine in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.", 
    "42": "The antipsychotic efficacy of aripiprazole is not generally associated with extrapyramidal symptoms, cardiovascular effects, sedation or elevations in serum prolactin that characterize typical or atypical antipsychotics. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of action of aripiprazole that underlies its favourable clinical profiles. The preclinical efficacy and side-effect profiles of aripiprazole were evaluated using several pharmaco-behavioural test systems in mice and rats, both in vivo and ex vivo, and compared with those of other conventional and atypical antipsychotics. Each of the antipsychotics induced catalepsy and inhibited apomorphine-induced stereotypy. The catalepsy liability ratios for these drugs were 6.5 for aripiprazole, 4.7 for both olanzapine and risperidone. The ptosis liability ratios for aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone were 14, 7.2 and 3.3, respectively. Aripiprazole slightly increased DOPA accumulation in the forebrain of reserpinised mice, reduced 5-HTP accumulation at the highest dose and exhibited a weaker inhibition of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine-induced head twitches. Aripiprazole did not inhibit physostigmine- or norepinephrine-induced lethality in rats. In conclusion, aripiprazole shows a favourable preclinical efficacy and side-effect profile compared to a typical antipsychotics. This profile may result from its high affinity partial agonist activity at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and its antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors.", 
    "43": "We report the results of a double-blind, randomized prospective trial on D2 and 5-HT2 receptor occupancy and the clinical effects of olanzapine versus clozapine in a sample of neuroleptic-refractory schizophrenic patients. Receptor occupancy was evaluated in different cortical areas and in basal ganglia using [18F] fluoro-ethyl-spiperone ([18F] FESP) and positron emission tomography (PET). A total of 15 neuroleptic-free patients completed the study undergoing a baseline and a post-treatment PET scan (olanzapine, nine patients, one female; clozapine, six patients, three female) 8 weeks after starting treatment. PET data were analysed both by regions of interest and on a voxel-by-voxel basis using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM96). Olanzapine and clozapine induced a similar and significant inhibition of [18F] FESP binding index in the cortex. In the basal ganglia, receptor occupancy was significantly higher with olanzapine than with clozapine (p=0.0018). By contrast, no differences in receptor occupancy were detected at the level of the pituitary gland. Clinical outcomes, in particular a full extra pyramidal tolerability, were similar. In this sample of neuroleptic-refractory schizophrenic patients, olanzapine and clozapine showed a different pattern of occupancy of D2-like receptor despite a common lack of extrapyramidal side-effects.", 
    "44": "Increased appetite and weight gain are frequently reported in treatment with olanzapine. However, the mechanism behind this appetite gain remains unclear. Ghrelin is a newly discovered appetite-stimulating peptide that has a role in the regulation of feeding behavior. Ghrelin is synthesized principally in the stomach, and the concentration of circulating ghrelin is negatively correlated with leptin and body fat mass. To elucidate the mechanism of appetite and weight gain during olanzapine treatment, we investigated the circulating ghrelin levels.", 
    "45": "Seven patients with schizophrenia were examined before and after 6-month administration of olanzapine. The concentrations of circulating ghrelin, leptin, glucose and lipid metabolic parameters were measured.", 
    "46": "Body fat percentage (P=0.0121) and serum leptin (P=0.0284) were significantly increased after 6-month administration of olanzapine. Both plasma total ghrelin (P=0.0188) and active ghrelin levels (P=0.0057) were significantly increased. Six of the seven patients reported increased appetite during olanzapine treatment. Other glucose and lipid parameters were not altered significantly.", 
    "47": "Although, the leptin level and body fat percentage were significantly increased, the concentration of circulating ghrelin was also significantly increased. Olanzapine may directly act on the secretion of ghrelin and induce appetite, resulting in weight gain.", 
    "48": "Patients with panic disorder have blunted growth hormone (GH) responses to clonidine, suggesting subsensitivity of post-synaptic alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors, presumably in response to excessive central noradrenergic outflow. However, basal levels of GH release over a full circadian cycle have not been examined in panic. Reduced basal GH release would suggest an overall hypo-active GH system rather than a specific alpha-adrenergic abnormality.", 
    "49": "To determine whether panic patients show reduced basal GH secretion, 20 patients and 12 healthy controls were studied. Blood samples were drawn every 15 min for 24 h and plasma was assayed for GH. Patients were restudied during successful treatment with alprazolam. Groups were compared on overnight and daytime GH secretion and circadian patterns of release.", 
    "50": "Patients showed normal levels on all measures of GH release. Treatment may have reduced nocturnal GH release slightly, but treated patients still did not differ from controls. The normal predominance of sleep over waking GH secretion was seen in both groups.", 
    "51": "Panic patients, in contrast to depressed patients, have normal somatotrophic axis activity when measured in a resting state over a full circadian cycle. GH dysregulation may only be evident in these patients in activation paradigms and has been most consistently demonstrated by challenges with the alpha(2)-noradrenergic agonist, clonidine.", 
    "52": "We report the first stereospecific synthesis and reactivity of a novel tetrahydroisoquinolino[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine ring system with DNA recognition potential.", 
    "53": "Even though benzodiazepines have a strong position in medicinal chemistry, very few synthetic routes to 1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3,5(2H,4H)-diones have ever been published and the claimed products have often been poorly characterized. Through the present work several 1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3,5(2H,4H)-diones have become available from N-carbamoylmethylanthranilic acids. The required ring closures were achieved only when the amino groups of the starting materials were substituted with electron withdrawing groups such as acetyl, alkyloxycarbonyl, or nitroso. During the synthetic work a novel ring contraction rearrangement from a 1-nitroso-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione to a 3H-quinazoline-4-one was observed. The proposed mechanism involves elimination of HNO followed by a proton-mediated loss of CO. The 1-nitrosated 1,4-benzodiazepinediones could be separately denitrosated to the corresponding amino compounds.", 
    "54": "We investigated the efficacy of a combination of ketamine and midazolam, comparing intravenous, oral, and rectal administrations for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. Seventy-three children under 5 years of age, who were scheduled for invasive procedure, were assigned to one of three groups: IV group (n = 25), ketamine 1 mg/kg and midazolam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg were given intravenously; PO group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were given orally; and PR group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg given rectally. Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored, and patients were observed for side-effects. Optimal sedation (drowsy and asleep) was provided in 78 per cent of all patients and no statistical difference was observed among the three groups. No severe complications were observed in all groups. Recovery time from sedation was significantly longer in the intravenous group (>120 min in two patients). Hallucination was noted in three (12 per cent) patients given intravenous medication, but not in those given oral or rectal medications. It is concluded that intravenous, oral, and rectal midazolam/ketamine are equally effective for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. The use of intravenous ketamine/midazolam may produce prolonged sedation and psychedelic effects in children. These adverse effects may alter the child's comfort and parental satisfaction.", 
    "55": "In the process of drug discovery, brain and plasma measurements of new chemical entities in rodents are of interest, particularly when the target receptors are in the brain. Brain-to-plasma ratios (B/P) obtained from a rodent pharmacokinetic assay are useful in helping determine which compounds are brain penetrant. The study reported here was performed to determine whether whole-body saline perfusion for complete blood removal was required to accurately measure brain tissue compound concentrations. Diazepam was used as a positive control since it is highly brain penetrant. Compound A was used as a negative control since it had known poor brain penetration. After intravenous dosing with either diazepam or compound A, rats were anesthetized and blood was collected, then the brain was removed following no perfusion or whole-body perfusion with saline. The analytes described (compound A, diazepam, and the internal standard) were recovered from plasma or brain homogenate by use of protein precipitation, and were subsequently analyzed by use of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The B/P values determined by use of LC-MS were not significantly different in perfused vs. non-perfused rats (P > or = 0.05). This approach (whole brain collected from non-perfused male rats) is an attractive alternative over brain penetration studies of perfused rats, since it has markedly reduced the technical time and potential for pain and distress required for generating B/P data due to elimination of the requirement for anesthesia and surgical preparation of animals.", 
    "56": "B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells develop resistance to nucleoside analogs over time. This chemoresistance may be caused by selection for B-CLL cells with defects in the particular apoptosis pathway triggered by these drugs. Therefore, anticancer agents that induce apoptosis through alternative pathways might be useful in treating chemoresistant B-CLL. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are a class of synthetic drugs with definite molecular targets, which have demonstrated cytotoxicity against leukemic cell lines. We have studied the ex vivo effect of the FTI BMS-214662 on cells from 18 patients with B-CLL. Low concentrations (<1 microM) of BMS-214662 prevented farnesylation of the chaperone marker HDJ-2 and had no effect on Akt activation. BMS-214662 induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells from all patients studied, including those showing resistance to cladribine and fludarabine ex vivo and in vivo. Treatment with BMS-214662 induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), phosphatidylserine exposure, proapoptotic conformational changes of Bax and Bak, reduction in Mcl-1 levels and activation of caspases 9 and 3. The general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk did not prevent BMS-214662-induced cell death. These results indicate that BMS-214662 may be a useful drug for treating B-CLL and, in particular, an alternative for the therapy of purine analog-resistant or relapsed B-CLL.", 
    "57": "A relationship between extracellular Ca(+2), fowl sperm phospholipase A2 activity, long-chain acylcarnitine content, and motility was demonstrated in previous work. Sperm motility appeared to depend upon Na+-dependent Ca(+2) cycling when sperm were incubated at body temperature without glucose. In the present work, motility decreased as a function of time when sperm were incubated in 2 mM Ca(+2) prepared with either buffered isotonic sucrose or LiCl. However, this effect was less pronounced in the case of LiCl. The sparing effect of Li+ was attributed to the mitochondrial Na+/Ca(+2) exchanger. Motile concentration decreased exponentially in response to micromolar concentrations of CGP 37157, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca(+2) exchanger. KB-R7943 mesylate, an inhibitor of the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca(+2) exchanger, prevented re-initiation of motility when exogenous Ca(+2) was added to sperm rendered immotile by incubation with 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, a high-affinity Ca(+2) chelator. The presence of voltage-gated Ca(+2) channels was confirmed by the effect of nifedipine on motile concentration. Neither motile concentration nor straight line velocity was affected by either ouabain or orthovanadate, which inhibit Na+-K+ ATPase and Ca(+2)-ATPase, respectively. In summary, we infer that 1) fowl sperm motility is dependent upon extracellular Ca(+2) cycling through mitochondria; 2) such cycling is dependent upon extracellular Na+; and 3) fowl sperm conserve ATP by moving neither Na+ nor Ca(+2) by active transport. Understanding the relationship between mitochondrial Ca(+2) cycling and ATP production may be applicable to long-term semen storage.", 
    "58": "Rape drugs or compounds used for chemical submission are current hot topics of numerous media based on a few well-documented identified cases. In the aim of considering the compounds potentially involved and subsequently the samples to collect and the toxicological analyses to perform, and according to the aggressor's viewpoint (victim submission and impunity of himself or herself), the characteristics of such compounds were drawn following the drug pharmacological properties. The compounds or therapeutic classes potentially used are numerous and diverse because the expected effects can be obtained by many neuropharmacological mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms. However, a few drugs (i.e. several benzodiazepines, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate) seem to be the ideal candidates owing to advantageous pharmacological properties (low blood concentrations, short elimination half-life) and practical ones (availability, galenic forms). It appears that the quality and precocity of biological specimen collection, the use of specific and sensitive analytical techniques, and the collaboration between the clinician and the toxicologist, are the essential keys for successful toxicological investigations when a case of chemical submission is suspected.",

Thirty-four patients among them received conventional treatment (including early gastric lavage, hepatoprotection, diuresis or respiratory support), and the remaining were given conventional treatment and hemoperfusion. Toxin concentration changes in blood before and after hemoperfusion, survival rate, time from come onset to regaining consciousness and convulsion termination and duration of clinical course were compared.",

Meanwhile the clinical course was markedly shortened in the hemoperfusion group (P < 0.05). The time from coma onset to regaining consciousness and convulsion termination in the hemoperfusion group was significantly shorter than that in the non-hemoperfusion group. The clearance rate was different for different poisons, among them the benzodiazepines had an excellent clearance.",

In vitro 3beta-hydroxypregnane steroids antagonize allopregnanolone-induced effects, but no antagonism has been shown in vivo. Our purpose was to evaluate 3beta-20beta-dihydroxy-5alpha-pregnane (UC1011) as a blocker of allopregnanolone-induced effects in vivo and in vitro in rats. We tested adult male Wistar rats in the Morris water maze 8 min after daily injections (i.v.) of allopregnanolone 2 mg/kg (n = 21); allopregnanolone : UC1011 2 : 6 (n = 7), 2 : 8 (n = 7), 2 : 20 (n = 14) mg/kg; UC1011 20 mg/kg (n = 14); or vehicle (10% 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, n = 4). Studies of chloride ion uptake into cortical and hippocampal membrane preparations were performed. The latency to find the hidden platform was still high in the allopregnanolone-injected group on day 6. Day 3-6 rats injected with allopregnanolone and UC1011 (2 : 20 mg/kg) had lower latency (P < 0.05), compared to the allopregnanolone-injected group. The group that only received UC1011 learned the location of the platform as fast as the controls. There was no significant difference in swim speed between groups. The time spent swimming close to the pool wall was in the allopregnanolone : UC1011 group (2 : 20 mg/kg) significantly decreased (P < 0.05, day 3-6), compared to the allopregnanolone-injected group. The increased chloride ion uptake induced by increasing dosage of allopregnanolone in the presence of 10 micro m GABA was significantly decreased with UC1011 (P < 0.01), in both cortical and hippocampal homogenates. In conclusion, UC1011 can via antagonism at the GABA-A receptor reduce the negative allopregnanolone effect on learning in the water maze.", 
    "64": "Previous studies suggest that cholecystokinin (CCK) is implicated in the modulation of pain sensitivity and the development of neuropathic pain. We used CCK(2) receptor deficient (CCK(2) (-/-)) mice and assessed their mechanical sensitivity using Von Frey filaments, as well as the development and time course of mechanical hyperalgesia in a model of neuropathic pain. We found that CCK(2) (-/-) mice displayed mechanical hyposensitivity, which was reversed to the level of wild-type animals after administration of naloxone (0.1-10 mg/kg). On the other hand, injection of L-365260 (0.01-1 mg/kg), an antagonist of CCK(2) receptors, decreased dose-dependently, mechanical sensitivity in wild-type mice. The mechanism of reduced mechanical sensitivity in CCK(2) (-/-) mice may be explained by changes in interactions between CCK and opioid systems. Indeed, CCK(2) (-/-) mice natively expressed higher levels of lumbar CCK(1), opioid delta and kappa receptors. Next, we found that CCK(2) (-/-) mice did not develop mechanical hyperalgesia in the Bennett's neuropathic pain model. Induction of neuropathy resulted in decrease of lumbar pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in wild-type mice, but increase of POMC expression in CCK(2) (-/-) mice. In addition, induction of neuropathy resulted in further increase of opioid delta receptor in CCK(2) (-/-) mice. Gene expression results indicate up-regulation of opioid system in CCK(2) (-/-) mice, which apparently result in decreased neuropathy score. Our study suggests that not only pain sensitivity, but also mechanical sensitivity and the development of neuropathic pain are regulated by antagonistic interactions between CCK and opioid systems.",

Demographic and neurophysiological monitoring data were collected from the hospital records. Patients were divided into two groups based on the anesthetic technique used for surgery: in Group 1 general anesthesia was used, and in Group 2 conscious sedation. Group 1 comprised 24 patients (mean age 47 years) with 16 right- and eight left-sided lesions. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients (mean age 46 years) with 18 right- and three left-sided lesions. Pathological diagnoses were similar between the two groups. Motor stimulation was elicited in 12 patients (50%) in Group 1 and in 21 patients (100%) in Group 2 (p < 0.001). In addition, the mean stimulation amplitude required was significantly higher (13 mA) in patients in whom conscious sedation was used as opposed to general anesthesia (5 mA, p < 0.0001). Electrographic evidence of seizures was seen in 29% of Group 1 compared with 10% of Group 2 patients (p > 0.05).",

GABA (0.1-100 microM) induced Cl- -ATPase activity with the maximum effect at 10 microM. Diazepam (0.1 microM) enhanced the effect of low GABA concentrations (0.1-1 microM) on Cl- -ATPase activity but had no effect on the enzyme in the presence of high GABA concentrations (10-100 microM). At the same time, GABA (1 microM) enhanced the effect of low diazepam concentrations (0.1-1 microM) on the enzyme activity but had no effect on it in the presence of high concentrations of the ligand. Blockers of GABAA-ergic receptors, picrotoxin (50 microM) and bicuculline (5 microM), canceled the combined effect of diazepam and GABA on the enzyme activity. The obtained data demonstrate that the combined effect of diazepam and GABAA-ergic ligands on Cl- -ATPase activity at physiological pH is similar to the effect of these ligands on GABAA/benzodiazepine/Cl- channel.",

On the diagnosis of left intrascrotal tumor, left high orchiectomy with partial scrotal skin resection was performed. Pathological examination of the specimen and systemic metastasis survey revealed embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of left spermatic cord with multiple lung metastasis (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group IV). Systemic chemotherapy with etoposide (VP-16), cisplatin (CDDP), and ifosfamide (IFO) (VIP therapy) was started. Although epilepsy-like symptoms occurred at the first course of VIP therapy, these symptoms immediately improved by diazepam administration. These symptoms were thought to be due to the adverse effects of IFO. To our knowledge, there were little reports on epilepsy-like symptoms caused by IFO in Japan. On the other hand, his multiple lung metastasis disappeared after the second course of VIP therapy. Although IFO may be effective in rhabdomyosarcoma, the toxicity of various nervous systems may be discovered.",

    "82": "Methamphetamine production and use has increased dramatically during the past 10 years. Methamphetamine production requires combining hazardous and volatile chemicals that expose the manufacturer to burn injuries from explosions and chemical spills. We sought to review the epidemiology of burn injuries in a rural burn center secondary to the use of amphetamine or methamphetamine and/or the manufacture of methamphetamine. Review of the records of 507 patients who were admitted to our burn unit from December 1, 1998, to December 31, 2001, revealed 34 patients who were involved in the use of amphetamines or methamphetamines and/or the manufacture of methamphetamine. Thirty-one patients tested positive for either amphetamine (n = 2) or methamphetamine (n = 29) on routine admission urine drug screens. Twenty of these patients were involved in the manufacture of methamphetamines. Three additional patients were identified as methamphetamine manufacturers but tested negative for the use of methamphetamines. The mean age of the study population was 31.88 +/- 7.65 years, with a male:female ratio of 10.3:1. The average burn size was 18.86 +/- 20.72, with the majority secondary to flame (n = 26). Patient burn admission histories were vague, and the patient's involvement in the manufacture of methamphetamine was often only later confirmed by media, the fire marshal, family members, or the patient. Fifteen patients showed the usual withdrawal pattern of agitation and hypersomnolence, with seven patients requiring detoxification with benzodiazepines. Two were admitted acutely to the psychiatric ward for uncontrollable agitation. Eighteen patients were offered chemical dependency treatment, and two completed therapy. There was one mortality. The mean cost per person was US 77,580 dollars (range, US 112 dollars - US 426,386 dollars). The increasing use of and manufacture of methamphetamine presents new challenges for the burn team because these patients can become violent and frequently need assistance with detoxification. Routine drug screens are mandatory in identifying methamphetamine use to alert burn unit personnel to particular management problems and target individuals who may be receptive to drug rehabilitation.",

However, emotional behaviors, such as novelty and emergence responses have not been reported in micro-opioid receptor knockout mice due to the disruptions of exon 2 and 3. Here, we report that mu-opioid receptor knockout mice, with deletion of exon 2 and 3, display significant emotional behavior changes; they showed less anxiety in the elevated plus maze and emergence tests, reduced response to novel stimuli in the novelty test, and less depressive-like behavior in the forced-swim test. Analysis of the compensatory mechanism in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice revealed that the M1 mRNA levels were reduced in the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, and that M1 receptor levels were reduced in the nucleus accumbens, CA1, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, versus the wild-type. However, 5-HT1A receptor levels were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus of mu-opioid receptor knockout mice versus the wild-type. These aberrant emotional behavioral phenotypes are possibly related to M1 and 5-HT1A receptor alterations in the micro-opioid receptor knockout mice. Overall, our study suggests that micro-opioid receptor may play a role in the modification of emotional responses to novelty, anxiety, and depression.", 
    "88": "The influence of using normal-phase and reversed-phase versions of four commercial polysaccharide stationary phases on chiral separations was investigated with capillary electrochromatography (CEC). Both versions of the stationary phases, Chiralcel OD, OJ, and Chiralpak AD, AS were tested for the separation of two basic, two acidic, a bifunctional, and a neutral compound. Different background electrolytes were used, two at low pH for the acid, bifunctional and neutral substances, and three at high pH for the basic, bifunctional and neutral ones. This setup allowed evaluating differences between both stationary-phase versions and between mobile-phase compositions on a chiral separation. Duplicate CEC columns of each stationary phase were in-house prepared and tested, giving information about the intercolumn reproducibility. In general, reversed-phase versions of the current commercial polysaccharide stationary phases are found to be best for reversed-phase CEC, even though at high pH no significant differences were seen between both versions. Most differences were observed at low pH. For acidic compounds, it was seen that an ammonium formate electrolyte performed best, which is also an excellent electrolyte if coupling with mass spectrometry is desired. For basic, bifunctional and neutral compounds, no significant differences between the three tested electrolytes were observed at high pH. Here, a phosphate buffer is preferred as electrolyte because of its buffering capacities. However, if coupling to mass spectrometry is wanted, the more volatile ammonium bicarbonate electrolyte can be used as an alternative.", 
    "89": "The aim of this study was to assess the anxiolytic effect of berberine (abbrev. BER) using two experimental anxiety models in the mouse. In the black and white test of anxiety, berberine (100, 500 mg/kg) produced an increase in the first time entry, time spent in the white section, and total changes between two compartments. On the other hand, in the elevated plus-maze test, berberine (100, 500 mg/kg) produced an increase in the time spent and arm entries in the open arms, and a decrease in the time spent and arm entries in the closed arms. Berberine (500 mg/kg) decreased locomotor activity in mice. Furthermore, BER at 100, 500 mg/kg decreased concentrations of NE, DA and 5-HT, and increased the concentrations of VMA, HVA and 5-HIAA in the brain stem. BER also attenuated the anxiogenic effect of WAY-100635, 8-OH DPAT and DOI and enhanced the anxiolytic effect of BUS, p-MPPI and RIT in the elevated plus-maze. These results suggested that berberine at 100 mg/kg had a significant anxiolytic-like effect, which was similar to that observed with 1 mg/kg diazepam and 2 mg/kg buspirone. The anxiolytic mechanism of BER might be related to the increase in turnover rates of monoamines in the brain stem and decreased serotonergic system activity. Moreover, BER decreased serotonergic system activity via activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors and inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors.",

However, factors that affect the solubilization behavior of these phospholipid micelles are not well understood. This study investigates the effect of PEG chain length and PC content on physical properties and solubilization potential of PEGylated phospholipid micelles. Critical micelle concentrations (CMC) determined for DSPE-PEG with different PEG chain lengths (2000, 3000, and 5000) using a fluorescent probe were in the micromolar range (0.5-1.5 microM) with higher CMC for longer PEG chain length. The size of micelles determined by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) showed that micellar systems became heterogeneous when PC was added at > or =25% for DSPE-PEG 2000 and > or = 40% for DSPE-PEG 5000, respectively. Above these critical PC ratios a significant increase in aggregation number and formation of rodlike particles were observed by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Solubilization of diazepam was greater with DSPE-PEG 2000 than DSPE-PEG 5000 simple micelles as determined by RP-HPLC. However, DSPE-PEG 5000 micelles showed greater improvement in solubilization of the water-insoluble drug with an increase in PC content. In conclusion, phospholipid micelle size and solubilization potential varied with PEG chain length and PC content in the mixed micelle. Aggregation number and shape of the micelles did not significantly change until the critical PC concentrations.",

Detailed psychiatric examinations, observations of the patient during such attacks and EEG records confirmed the diagnosis of dysthymic attacks of temporal epilepsy. The author treated the patient with sertraline starting at a low dose and increasing up to 100 mg daily - administered orally once daily in the morning, clonazepam in oral doses 1 mg in the morning, 1 mg at lunchtime, 2 mg in the evening, and carbamazepine 200 mg tablets from low doses to 400 mg administered once daily in the evening.

Scores for trait anxiety, and to a lesser extent state anxiety, were significantly higher among subjects with joint hypermobility syndrome than among subjects without this syndrome (median trait anxiety scores for women: 17 versus 11; median scores for men: 13 versus 1). These findings indicate that the association of joint hypermobility syndrome and anxiety holds even for subjects with no psychiatric diagnosis.

When NR1 and NR2 are mutated PB responsiveness is abolished. While no nuclear receptor for which PB is an agonist ligand has yet been identified, PB is a ligand of GABA(A) receptors and it can displace [(3)H] 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK 11195) from its binding site on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). We assessed CYP2B levels in primary rat hepatocytes following treatment with 10 ligands of either or both of these receptors. All compounds tested were found to be CYP2B1/CYP2B2 inducers and most were CYP3A inducers. Five had not previously been described as CYP2B1/CYP2B2 inducers: bicuculline, flunitrazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864), N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide (FGIN 1-27) and 7-(dimethylcarbamoyloxy)-6-phenylpyrrolo-[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepine (DCPPBT). Reporter gene analysis demonstrated that CYP2B induction by these agents and other PBR or GABA(A) receptor ligands is mediated through the PBRU and the NR1/NR2 sites, suggesting a molecular mechanism similar to that for PB induction. The potencies for PBRU-dependent induction by 11 ligands of PBR or the GABA(A) receptor was evaluated. FGIN-127, DCPPBT and PK 11195 exhibited EC(50) values for PBRU-dependent transcription activation about three orders of magnitude higher than the reported affinities of the PBR for these agents, arguing against the involvement of the PBR in PB induction. However the EC(50) values found for the agents tested encourage further investigation on the possible involvement of the GABA(A) receptor in PB induction.",

Shortly after the midazolam was provided, the child developed urticaria in both ankles, which rapidly progressed to the lower extremities, stomach, back, arms, neck, and face. The periorbital skin also became edematous. In the emergency room, the diagnosis of an urticaria allergic reaction was confirmed. The child was treated with intramuscular diphenylhydramine, discharged from the emergency room after 5 hours, and prescribed oral diphenylhydramine (Benadryl) and prednisolone (Orapred). Children who receive sedatives such as midazolam in the dental clinic should be carefully monitored from the moment they receive the sedative, in order to disclose and treat undesirable side effects of the sedative agents as early as possible. The implications of allergic reactions to sedative agents in the dental clinic are reviewed.",

    "107": "A mutation in the gamma2 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor (GABAR), which changes an arginine to a glutamine at position 43 (R43Q), is linked to familial idiopathic epilepsies. We used radioligand binding, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence techniques to examine the properties of wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 and mutant alpha1beta2gamma2R43Q GABARs expressed in HEK 293 cells. The gamma2R43Q mutation had no affect on the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam. However, in cells expressing alpha1beta2gamma2R43Q GABARs, the number of binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam relative to wild-type receptors was decreased 75%. Using surface protein biotinylation, affinity purification, and immunoblotting, we demonstrated that expression of cell surface alpha1beta2gamma2R43Q GABARs was decreased. Surface immunostaining of HEK 293 cells expressing alpha1beta2gamma2R43Q GABARs confirmed that surface expression of the gamma2R43Q subunit was reduced. These data demonstrate that the gamma2R43Q mutation impairs expression of cell surface GABARs. A deficit in surface GABAR expression would reduce synaptic inhibition and result in neuronal hyperexcitability, which could explain why families possessing the gamma2R43Q subunit have epilepsy.", 
    "108": "The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam on the QT interval in volunteers with schizophrenia. Intramuscular haloperidol and intramuscular lorazepam are standard treatments in the acute management of agitation and aggression. Although prolongation of the QT interval and sequelae, including torsade de pointes and death, have been reported for haloperidol (but not lorazepam), formal studies have been lacking. Volunteers with schizophrenia (n = 12) were administered a single intramuscular injection of 7.5 mg haloperidol or 4 mg lorazepam in a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design. Serial EKGs and concurrent blood samples were obtained over 6 hours following each injection. Changes in the QT interval were evaluated, as were plasma drug and prolactin concentrations. Haloperidol injection increased the heart rate-corrected QT interval an average of 5.1 msec using Bazett's correction (QTb 90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3, 9.8), 3.6 msec using Fridericia's correction (QTf 90% CI: 0.02, 7.2), and 4.2 msec using an empirically derived \"baseline correction\" (QT(ii) 90% CI: 0.3, 8.0). Effects of lorazepam on QT were nullified by correction for the heart rate elevation (QTb 3.8 msec, 90% CI: 0.6, 7.1; QTf 0.0 msec, 90% CI: -3.2, 3.4; QTii -2.3 msec, 90% CI: -6.6, 2.0). An association between QT prolongation and occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms was observed. On average, intramuscular haloperidol led to minimal prolongation of the QT interval. This propensity is of theoretical concern in individuals with risk factors for torsade de pointes but seems unlikely to be a problem in the vast majority of patients.", 
    "109": "A systematic kinetic analysis of the metabolism of five benzodiazepines (low to high clearance compounds) was performed in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19 baculovirus-expressed recombinant systems. The data obtained in the expression systems were scaled and compared with human liver microsomal predicted clearance and observed in vivo values, using either cytochrome P450 relative activity factors (RAFs) or the relative abundance approach. Interindividual variability, both in content (CYP3A4, CYP3A5) and activity (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19), were incorporated in the clearance prediction by bootstrap analysis. These resampling Monte Carlo-based simulations were performed to justify any distribution assumptions in the generated range of the predicted clearance due to a limited sample size. This approach allowed extrapolation of the recombinant clearance data to specific population groups and investigation of the role of \"minor\" forms like CYP3A5 and CYP2C19 in comparison to the most prolific CYP3A4. The use of quinidine 3-hydroxylation and alprazolam 1'-hydroxylation as RAF markers for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 activity, respectively, and the incorporation of variability improved the clearance prediction of the selected benzodiazepines (apart from flunitrazepam) to within 2-fold of the in vivo value. Clearance estimates from the immunoquantified protein levels were approximately 8-fold lower in comparison to the RAF approach. The differences observed in the benzodiazepine metabolite pathway ratios between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, particularly for 1'- to 4-hydroxymidazolam and alprazolam, provided a useful measure of interindividual differences within the CYP3A family.",

    "120": "The physiological significance of the large diversity of GABA A receptors is poorly understood. Using mice, which carry a point mutation that renders specific subtypes of GABA A receptors diazepam insensitive, it was recently discovered that particular types of GABA A receptors are involved in specific, behaviorally relevant signaling pathways. We have used these mice to study inhibitory synaptic transmission in the amygdala. GABA A receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) per se were not affected by the point mutations. Their modulation by diazepam, however, was altered depending on the genotype of the mice studied. Based on the different responses to diazepam, we found that IPSCs in the lateral/basolateral amygdala were mediated by both alpha2- and alpha1-subunit-containing GABA A receptors whereas those in the central amygdala were mediated only by alpha2-subunit-containing GABA A receptors. Immunohistochemical staining corroborated these findings at a morphological level. To investigate a possible link between interneuron and receptor diversity, we selectively depressed release from the subset of GABAergic terminals carrying type 1 cannabinoid receptors. These receptors are known to modulate amygdala-mediated behavior. Application of a type 1 cannabinoid receptor agonist resulted in a selective reduction of inhibitory current mediated by alpha1-subunit-containing GABA A receptors. Mice with specific diazepam-insensitive GABA A receptor subtypes therefore provide a novel tool to investigate GABA A receptor distribution and the organization of inhibitory circuits at a functional level. The crucial role of the amygdala for the mediation of anxiety is in agreement with the part that alpha2-subunit-containing GABA A receptors play in anxiolysis and their important function in this area of the brain.",

Activation of GBRs leads to membrane hyperpolarization. In the VTA, infusions of GBR agonists enhance 3alpha,5alpha-THP-facilitated lordosis. Thus, if, in the VTA, MBR-mediated increases in 3alpha,5alpha-THP enhance sexual responses via actions at GBRs, then blocking GBRs with picrotoxin will reduce FGIN 1-27-induced increases in sexual behavior of female rodents.",

    "153": "Benzodiazepines are the most frequently prescribed antianxiety drugs in the elderly. Despite their usefulness and safety in the younger population, there is concern about the rationale for their use in the elderly. Studies of the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines in the elderly are rare. Elderly females with co-morbid medical and psychiatric conditions and who are taking multiple medications form the group most frequently prescribed benzodiazepines among the elderly, and the group most likely to experience side effects. Age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes increase the potential for certain side effects in the elderly. Significant adverse effects that may be associated with benzodiazepine use in the elderly include falls, cognitive impairment, sedation, and impairment of driving skills, all of which are particularly related to the long half-life of benzodiazepines. Long-term use of benzodiazepines should be discouraged because of the risk of dependence, which is a serious problem in the elderly. Unrecognised and untreated benzodiazepine dependence can lead to serious medical complications.", 
    "154": "Desloratadine is a non-sedating antihistamine recently approved for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The major metabolite of desloratadine in human plasma and urine is the glucuronide conjugate of 3-hydroxydesloratadine. 3-Hydroxydesloratadine-glucuronide is also the major in vitro metabolite of 3-hydroxydesloratadine formed by incubation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine with human liver microsomes supplemented with uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronic acid (UDPGA). The metabolite structure was confirmed by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Out of ten recombinant human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8 and UGT2B15 exhibited catalytic activity with respect to the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine-glucuronide. Inhibition studies with known inhibitors of UGT (diclofenac, flunitrazepam and bilirubin) confirmed the involvement of UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT2B15 in the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine-glucuronide. The results from this study demonstrated that the in vitro formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine-glucuronide from 3-hydroxydesloratadine was mediated via UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT2B15 in human liver.", 
    "155": "We present a case of death after first manifestation of generalised convulsive status epilepticus in a young man. A previously healthy 23-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department by ambulance service with approximately 20 min of generalised convulsive seizures. First line treatment in the emergency ward with benzodiazepines failed. The patient was cardiopulmonary stable until, after more than 30 min of status epilepticus, he developed tachycardia and became bradypnoeic. Intubation and ventilation was performed and anticonvulsive treatment was escalated with thiopental. Fifteen minutes later he developed ventricular fibrillation. CPR was started. The patient became asystolic after 90 min CPR following the ILCOR (International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation) Instructions. CPR was continued for another 30 min without success. The patient died after 120 min of maximal efforts. Autopsy and toxicology were performed, neuropathologic examination showed general brain edema and neuronal cell loss in purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum and olive knots which may be the consequence of generalised convulsive status epilepticus. We conclude: status epilepticus becomes refractory in approximately 30 % of cases. Until now, there are no randomised trials on the optimal treatment of refractory status epilepticus. Better treatment algorithms are urgently needed.", 
    "156": "Perioperative management of geriatric patients is becoming an important component in anaesthetic practice in the 21st century. This phenomenon is due to the fact that people aged 65 and over are the segment with the fastest growing population. Thus, it is estimated that by the year 2025 20 % of the population in the western hemisphere will be > 65 years of age. Currently, elderly patients comprise one-third of all operations, and one out of two patients older than 65 years of age will undergo an operation in their lifetime. The dramatic change in demographics of surgical patients will have a tremendous impact on the use of anaesthetics. Older patients facing surgery can generally be expected to be a more complex case than their younger counterparts. They have more systemic diseases (e. g. cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine), and usually these diseases have advanced to more serious stages. These patients may suffer disability, both physical and mental, and may show differences in the pharmacokinetic as well as the pharmacodynamic of compounds such as opioids. While neuronal numbers, dendrites and synapses decline with age and the ventricular volume triples, cerebral circulation is similar to young adults, although there is a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). This is because of the lower unit weight, lower CBF and CMRO (2), which are tightly coupled in aging where autoregulation is preserved. However, because of a decline in dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic and GABAergic transmitters, anticholinergic compounds (atropine, scopolamine) as well as some anaesthetics such as ketamine, benzodiazepines or even propofol may produce delirium and/or an increase in efficacy when given together with opioids. Therefore it is mandatory to consider a pharmacologic interaction with a potentiation and/or an addition in effects of other drugs when judging the net action of opioids in the elderly. Physicians and nurses treating geriatric patients tend to have an unfounded level of fear of complications associated with treating perioperative pain. Although it is known that inadequate analgesia may delay recovery, the treatment of perioperative pain in the geriatric patient remains inadequate, even relative to younger patients. It is well established that there is increased responsiveness to the effects of opioids in the elderly. This may result in an increased risk of respiratory depression, while especially the elderly female patient demonstrates an increase in the duration of effects, but the risk of nausea is not augmented. Increased sensitivity of older patients to systemic opioids mostly involves pharmacokinetic factors such as a higher proportion of unbound and active substances as well as changes in drug redistribution. Because of a 40 % reduction in stroke volume in the elderly, there is a protracted redistribution of opioids to the liver. This results in a prolonged metabolisation, a lesser inactivation over time followed by an increase in duration of effects, mainly impairment of respiration. To a much lesser extent, pharmacodynamic factors with an increased response at opioid receptor sites have to be considered. Although the mechanisms causing differences of opioid action in the elderly may be complex, the clinical implications are not. They include slow titration of opioids to allow for long circulation times, lower total doses because of increased sensitivity, and anticipation of a longer duration of action because of reduced clearance. Since elderly patients present multimorbidity, therapy of chronic pain has to be considered in the light of multidrug intake, which, due to interaction, results in marked side-effects, and a prolonged duration of action. Those opioids should be used which, due to their pharmacokinetic properties, have a reduced volume of distribution, present a low plasma protein binding and finally result in the formation of no pharmacologically active metabolites.", 
    "157": "Phobic postural vertigo (PPV) is the second most common diagnosis on a dizziness unit. It is a somatoform syndrome characterized as a chronic and incapacitating condition with subjective imbalance and short attacks of dizziness. During a period of 18 months, PPV was observed in 41 patients among 251 of a dizziness unit. Twenty-six had primary PPV, among whom 65% had depressive or anxiety disorders, and 15 patients were diagnosed at secondary PPV. Normal neurological examination and diagnostic tests were observed in most cases. A favorable response to treatment (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, psychotherapy and/or orientation) was observed in 62% of all patients, without difference between both groups -- primary and secondary PPV. Despite the high prevalence, PPV is misdiagnosed. Therefore one must attempt to recognize it, since its appropriate treatment prevents recurrence and incapacitation.", 
    "158": "In the early 1990s, a new family of receptors were cloned that were found to mediate the intracellular metabolic effects of glutamate via coupling to secondary messenger systems, that is, the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. Eight such receptors (mGlu1 to mGlu8) have been cloned to date, and according to their amino acid sequence, pharmacology and second-messenger coupling, these receptors have been clustered into three groups (I-III). In contrast to the glutamate-gated ion channels (NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptors), which are responsible for fast excitatory transmission, mGlu receptors have been shown to play a modulatory role in the glutamatergic synaptic transmission either by modulating the ion channel activity or by influencing neurotransmitter release. Given the fact that the mGlu receptors are G-protein- coupled, they obviously constitute a new attractive group of \"drugable\" targets for the treatment of various CNS disorders. The recent discovery of small molecules that selectively bind to receptors of group I (mGlu1 and mGlu5) and group II (mGlu2 and mGlu3) allowed significant advances in our understanding of the roles of these receptors in brain physiology and pathophysiology. The identification of MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine), a highly selective and brain-penetrant mGlu5 receptor antagonist, allowed the exploration of the therapeutic potential of this class of compounds. Subsequent behavior studies revealed that--with the exception of benzodiazepines--mGlu5 receptor antagonists exhibit the widest and most robust anxiolytic activity in preclinical models seen to date. Upcoming clinical studies will soon indicate if the preclinical anxiolytic-like efficacy translates into anxiolytic activity in humans.", 
    "159": "Valerian is a medicinal agent deriving from the plant Valeriana officinalis L. We reviewed the available literature on the use of valerian preparations in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Preclinical studies suggest that valerian has sedative and muscle-relaxant effects. Few clinical trials with valerian have been carried out in conditions other than insomnia. The insomnia studies have methodologic shortcomings but suggest that some preparations lead to significant subjective improvement in sleep complaints with remarkably few side effects. Furthermore, some evidence indicates that valerian preparations may have a mechanism of action and clinical characteristics that differ from the benzodiazepine-related sedative/hypnotics, making them more suitable for long-term use. If this safety profile and the plant's sedative/hypnotic efficacy are confirmed in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with carefully and consistently prepared valerian compounds, then those compounds would fill an important and presently unfilled niche in the treatment of insomnia.", 
    "160": "Current British Thoracic Society guidelines do not recommend routinely the combined use of a benzodiazepine and opiate during flexible bronchoscopy (FB). A randomised, placebo controlled, double blind study was undertaken to determine whether hydrocodone in combination with midazolan improves cough suppression during FB without increasing the risk of desaturation.", 
    "161": "120 patients were randomised to receive midazolam and 5 mg i.v. hydrocodone or midazolam and placebo with topical anaesthesia. Pulse oximetry was recorded continuously during FB. Bronchoscopists and nurses charted their perception of cough and the patients rated their discomfort during the procedure on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS).", 
    "162": "There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the indication for FB, duration of procedure (21 (11) min v 22 (10) min, p = 0.570), doses of supplemental lignocaine (171 (60) mg v 173 (66) mg, p = 0.766) and midazolam (4.5 (2.3) mg v 4.9 (2.7) mg, p = 0.309), lowest oxygen saturation (94.8 (2.7) v 94.9 (2.7), p = 0.433), and desaturations < or =90%. Perception of cough by both the bronchoscopist and the nurse was significantly lower in the hydrocodone group (3 (0-10) and 3 (0-10)) than in the placebo group (6 (0-10) and 6 (0-10)), respectively (p = 0.001). According to the VAS scale, patients' tolerance was also significantly better with hydrocodone than with placebo (2 (0-8) v 3 (0-9), p = 0.043).", 
    "163": "The combination of midazolam and hydrocodone markedly reduces cough during FB without causing significant desaturation, especially when invasive diagnostic procedures are performed.", 
    "164": "A safe, rapid, and effective way to detoxify patients from substance misuse is important in facilitating further treatment of their psychiatric or substance use disorder. This paper discusses the treatment of acute withdrawal from polysubstance misuse in three patients in the intensive care unit setting using combined sedation with a benzodiazepine, lorazepam, and a general anaesthetic, propofol. Lorazepam alone was not effective in massive doses in these cases. The advantages and mechanism of action of using multiple agents to control refractory symptoms is discussed.", 
    "165": "A consensus has not been reached on the proper role of the different functional neuroimaging techniques available for the exploration of drug-resistant partial epilepsy, particularly in preparation for surgery. Several studies have suggested the potential contribution of positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG), [11C]-flumazenil (FMZ), or [11C]-alpha-methyl-tryptophane (AMT), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to measure ictal cerebral blood flow, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of language and memory functions, but to date there has been no impact study validating the clinical contribution of these different exploration techniques. The most robust data in the literature indicate that [18F]-FDG PET can help to predict surgical failures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Studies with lesser power have suggested that SPECT measurement of ictal hyperperfusion blood flow, and [11C]-FMZ and [11C]-AMT PET can be useful in symptomatic neocortical epilepsy, particularly in patients with tuberous sclerosis explored with [11C]-AMT PET. Use of these different exploration techniques in epileptic patients with a normal MRI is warranted when complementary information could help in deciding on when and how to perform an invasive EEG, but there are significant risks of erroneous identification of the epileptogenic zone. Functional MRI assessment of language regions can be proposed as an alternative to the Wada test to determine hemispheric dominance in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Multicentric impact studies will be needed before evidence-based guidelines can be developed for the use of functional neuroimaging techniques in drug-resistant partial epilepsy.", 
    "166": "The pharmacological profile of the new CCK1 receptor antagonist IQM-97,423, (4aS,5R)-2-benzyl-5-(tert-butylaminocarbonyl-tryptophyl)amino-1,3-dioxoperhydropyrido-[1,2-c]pyrimidine, was examined in in vitro and in vivo studies and compared with typical CCK1 antagonists such as devazepide and lorglumide. IQM-97,423 showed a high affinity at [3H]-pCCK8-labeled rat pancreatic CCK1 receptors, and was virtually devoid of affinity at brain CCK2 receptors. IQM-97,423 antagonized CCK8S-stimulated alpha-amylase release from rat pancreatic acini with a potency similar to devazepide and much higher than lorglumide. In the guinea pig isolated longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparation, IQM-97,423 produced a full antagonism of the contractile response elicited by CCK8S and a weaker effect on the contraction elicited by CCK4, suggesting a selective antagonism at CCK1 receptors. The protective effect of IQM-97,423 and devazepide was tested in two models of acute pancreatitis in rats, induced by injection of cerulein or by combined bile and pancreatic duct obstruction. The new compound fully prevented the cerulein-induced increase in plasma pancreatic enzymes and in pancreas weight with a potency similar to devazepide. In common bile-pancreatic duct ligature-induced acute pancreatitis, IQM-97,423 partially prevented, like devazepide, the increase in plasma pancreatic enzyme activity and in pancreas weight. Consequently, the pyridopyrimidine derivative IQM-97,423 is a potent and highly selective CCK1 receptor antagonist with preventive effects in two experimental models of acute pancreatitis and a potential therapeutic interest."
