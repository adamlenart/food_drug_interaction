To evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of a NCE on the pharmacokinetics of a cocktail of representative probes of CYP enzymes (midazolam for CYP3A4, tolbutamide for CYP2C9, omeprazole for CYP2C19 and dextromethorphan for CYP2D6) and the safety and tolerability of the NCE in the presence of probe substrates, a high throughput liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of tolbutamide, omeprazole, midazolam and dextromethorphan in human plasma using tolbutamide-d(9), midazolam-d(4), (+/-)-omeprazole-d(3), and dextromethorphan-d(3) as the internal standards (ISs). Human plasma samples of 50 microL were extracted by a simple protein-precipitation procedure and analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometer system. Reversed-phase HPLC separation was achieved with a Hypersil GOLD AQ column (50 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm). MS/MS detection was set at mass transitions of 271-->172 m/z for tolbutamide, 346-->198 m/z for omeprazole, 326-->291 m/z for midazolam, 272-->171 m/z for dextromethorphan, 280-->172 m/z for tolbutamide-d(9) (IS), 349-->198 m/z for (+/-)-omeprazole-d(3) (IS), 330-->295 m/z for midazolam-d(4) (IS), and 275-->171 m/z for dextromethorphan-d(3) (IS) in positive mode. The high throughput LC-MS/MS method was validated for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, stability, recovery, matrix effects, and calibration range. Acceptable intra-run and inter-run assay precision (<10%) and accuracy (<10%) were achieved over a linear range of 50-50,000 ng/mL for tolbutamide, 1-1000 ng/mL for omeprazole, 0.1-100 ng/mL for midazolam and 0.05-50 ng/mL for dextromethorphan in human plasma. Method robustness was demonstrated by the 100% pass rate of 24 incurred sample analysis runs and all of the 50 clinical study samples used for incurred sample reproducibility (ISR) test having met the acceptance criterion (%Diff within 20%). The overall ISR results for all compounds showed that over 95% of the samples had a %Diff of less than 10%.

Data regarding the toxicity and toxicokinetics of topiramate in acute overdose are limited. A case of massive, acute ingestion resulting in the highest reported topiramate level is presented, including toxicokinetic evaluation. A 37-year-old woman presented with coma unresponsive to naloxone following topiramate ingestion. She had normal vital signs without respiratory depression. She was intubated for airway protection, given 3.5 mg lorazepam IV for facial and neck muscle twitching, and transferred to our facility. No additional sedation was required for 18 h on the ventilator. Following mental status improvement, the patient was extubated. Confusion, dysarthria, and imbalance resolved over the next 2 days. Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis persisted for 3 days. Peak serum topiramate level was 356.6 microg/ml (reference range, 5-20 microg/ml). Massive topiramate ingestion led to prolonged coma with normal vital signs and nonanion gap metabolic acidosis. Coma of this severity has not been previously reported. Serum half-life, which has not been studied after overdose, was 16 h. Despite the large ingestion and significant presenting symptoms, the patient recovered fully with supportive intensive care alone. Massive acute topiramate ingestion may lead to nonanion gap metabolic acidosis and prolonged coma which resolves with intensive supportive care.

    "24": "Marijuana-dependent individuals report using marijuana to alleviate withdrawal, suggesting that pharmacotherapy of marijuana withdrawal could promote abstinence. To identify potential pharmacotherapies for marijuana withdrawal, this study first characterized rimonabant-induced Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) withdrawal in rhesus monkeys by using drug discrimination and directly observable signs. Second, drugs were examined for their capacity to modify cannabinoid withdrawal. Monkeys receiving chronic Delta(9)-THC (1 mg/kg/12 h s.c.) discriminated the cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (1 mg/kg i.v.) under a fixed ratio schedule of stimulus-shock termination. The discriminative stimulus effects of rimonabant were dose-dependent (ED(50) = 0.25 mg/kg) and accompanied by head shaking. In the absence of chronic Delta(9)-THC treatment (i.e., in nondependent monkeys), a larger dose (3.2 mg/kg) of rimonabant produced head shaking and tachycardia. Temporary discontinuation of Delta(9)-THC treatment resulted in increased responding on the rimonabant lever, head shaking, and activity during the dark cycle. The rimonabant discriminative stimulus was attenuated fully by Delta(9)-THC (at doses larger than mg/kg/12 h) and the cannabinoid agonist CP 55940 [5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-[5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]phenol], and partially by the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212-2 [(R)-(+)-[2, 3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone mesylate] and the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist clonidine. In contrast, a benzodiazepine (diazepam) and monoamine agonist (cocaine) did not attenuate the rimonabant discriminative stimulus. Head shaking was attenuated by all test compounds. These results show that the discriminative stimulus effects of rimonabant in Delta(9)-THC-treated monkeys are a more pharmacologically selective measure of cannabinoid withdrawal than rimonabant-induced head shaking. These results suggest that cannabinoid and noncannabinoid (alpha(2)-adrenergic) agonists are potentially useful therapeutics for marijuana dependence inasmuch as they attenuate the subjective experience of Delta(9)-THC withdrawal.",

    "34": "Hyperprolactinemia is a frequent consequence of treatment with some antipsychotic agents. Although prolactin secretion varies over the course of a day and during psychological circumstances, there is little information in the literature regarding the time dependence of the prolactin response to antipsychotics. We evaluated prolactin levels in schizophrenic patients receiving risperidone (3 mg twice daily), olanzapine (10 mg twice daily), or perospirone (16 mg twice daily) for at least 4 weeks. The subjects were compared to matched healthy controls. Plasma sample collection for quantification of drug and prolactin levels was conducted before and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after the morning dosing. Prolactin concentrations before dosing during risperidone treatment were significantly higher than during treatment with olanzapine and perospirone in females. The daily fluctuation of prolactin concentration after perospirone treatment was larger than that observed after risperidone and olanzapine treatments. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curves was greatest in subjects treated with risperidone, followed by perospirone and finally by olanzapine. These findings suggest that daily fluctuations in prolactin concentration after perospirone treatment are larger than following treatment with risperidone and olanzapine. The plasma concentration of prolactin during perospirone treatment therefore depends on the time of sampling.",

Until the reasons for these different survival rates are clarified, comparisons of outcomes from phase II studies with published RT + TMZ survival data should be interpreted with caution.", 
    "39": "The contribution of the lung to drug metabolism was investigated in rats and the possibility of prediction of in vivo metabolism from in vitro studies using rat pulmonary microsomes was assessed. Lidocaine, midazolam, or nifedipine was administered to rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg by the intra-arterial, intravenous, and intraportal routes. The pulmonary extraction ratios of lidocaine, midazolam, and nifedipine, calculated from the area under the time-plasma concentration curve (AUC) after the intra-arterial and intravenous administrations, were 39.0 +/- 0.5, 18.3 +/- 0.7, and 12.3 +/- 0.3%, respectively. The hepatic extraction ratios of lidocaine, midazolam, and nifedipine, calculated from the AUC after the intraportal and intravenous administrations, were 68.0 +/- 3.3, 52.6 +/- 0.4, and 13.5 +/- 0.2%, respectively. These results showed that both the liver and the lung contributed to the metabolism of these drugs. The above in vivo pulmonary extraction ratios correlated with the in vitro intrinsic clearance values, which were corrected with the protein unbound ratio in microsomes and plasma, suggesting that pulmonary extraction ratios can be predicted quantitatively from in vitro data. The pulmonary intrinsic clearance values of lidocaine, midazolam, and nifedipine in rat microsomes were lower than their hepatic intrinsic clearance, showing that there was an organ difference in metabolism between the liver and lung. Our results support the importance of the estimation of pulmonary metabolism to predict the total clearance more accurately.",

The volume of conscious sedation did not differ between groups. There was a positive correlation computed between midazolam and fentanyl dosages (r = 0.583, P < 0.01). Neither was significantly associated with gravidity. Gestational age was associated with both midazolam and fentanyl dose (r = 0.05, P = 0.047; r = 0.06, P = 0.024). There was no reported incidence of toxicity.",

The exception is in treatment-resistant populations where clozapine exhibits superiority, compared with other SGAs. In the CATIE trial, there is a suggestion that olanzapine is superior in effectiveness, compared with other nonclozapine SGAs, although this seems to be mediated by past history of olanzapine use, and carries with it increased weight gain and metabolic adverse events. From a cost-effectiveness perspective, there is no evidence that SGAs are superior to FGAs, with findings suggesting the possibility that FGAs may be superior.", 
    "47": "Past efficacy trials have strongly supported the position that SGAs are superior to FGAs in the treatment of schizophrenia and in side effect profile. Two large independent effectiveness trials, CUtLASS and CATIE, have offered a strong challenge to these claims. Both suggest that SGAs, except clozapine in the treatment-resistant population, offer little, if any, clinical benefits, and, moreover, harbour their own significant side effects.",

One in eight deaths worldwide are due to cancer, it is the second and third leading cause of death in economically developed and developing countries, respectively. As it is caused by both external and internal factors, a balanced approach to cancer control includes prevention, early detection, and effective treatment. In the treatment of cancer, chemotherapy is one of the practical methods and is widely used employing drugs that can destroy cancer cells by impeding their growth and reproduction. Despite the great strides made in the treatment of cancer over the past 50 years, it continues to be a major health concern and therefore, extensive efforts have been devoted to search for new scaffolds to develop chemotherapeutics. In this perspective, over the past two decades from this laboratory extensive efforts have been made in the development of new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. In this review, glimpses on types of current chemotherapeutic agents based on their action of inhibition and the new molecules that are being developed based on the scaffolds such as pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines, podophyllotoxins, benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides, naphthalimides and monastrol across the world as well as in this laboratory have been articulated.",

The circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) T3111C variant has been studied in association with sleep disturbances in depressed patients. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of T3111C CLOCK on insomnia, daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, and depression severity in a sample of 100 major depressive disorder patients. Inclusion criteria were: major depressive disorder, drug-free for any antidepressant and/or benzodiazepines for at least four weeks previously to the study, and a minimum score of >17 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Athens Insomnia Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were applied. No significant difference was found concerning genotype or allele groups and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression items or clusters. No difference was found between genotypes and comorbidity, chronotype distribution, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Athens Insomnia Scale, or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total scores. Overall, the present findings did not support the hypothesis of an effect of the T3111C CLOCK variant on sleep disturbances in major depressive disorder. Further analysis of clock machinery will clarify the contribution of clock genes to the maintenance of mental health.", 
    "50": "Mitochondria increasingly attract attention as control points within the mechanisms of neuronal death. Mitochondria play a central role in swinging the balance in favor of either survival or death of brain tissue. Cell death in vertebrates proceeds mostly via the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Permeability transition pore (PTP) development in mitochondria is a decisive stage of apoptosis. Therefore, regulation of the permeability of both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes helps to induce neuroprotection. Through PTP control, mitochondria can to a large degree manage the intracellular calcium homeostasis, and thus control the potent death cascade initiated by excess calcium. Here we summarize the evidence for the role of mitochondria in brain cell death. We describe the involvement of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO; previously called peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), and of two new mitochondrial proteins, that is, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) and p42(IP4) (also designated centaurin alpha1; ADAP 1), in the control of the PTP. Furthermore, ligands of TSPO, as well as substrates of CNP, are possible modulators of PTP function. This scenario of control and regulation of PTP function might provide multiple important targets, which are suitable for developing protective strategies for neurons and non-neuronal brain cells in therapies of neurodegenerative diseases.", 
    "51": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that, in addition to its use in adults, is now indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adolescents aged 13-17 years. In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, 6-week trial in adolescents aged 13-17 years with schizophrenia, the least squares mean reduction from baseline to 6 weeks in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRS-C) total score (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with olanzapine than with placebo. In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, 3-week trial in adolescents, aged 13-17 years, with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, the mean reduction from baseline to 3 weeks in the Adolescent Structured Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with olanzapine than with placebo. In extensions of each of the pivotal placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia and bipolar mania, open-label treatment with olanzapine for up to 26 weeks produced significant reductions from baseline to endpoint in BPRS-C and YMRS total scores, respectively. Oral olanzapine was generally well tolerated in adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar mania. Sedation and weight gain were the most common adverse events in placebo-controlled trials. Extrapyramidal symptoms were reported by 10% of olanzapine recipients compared with 6% of placebo recipients. Olanzapine-treated adolescents were likely to experience greater increases in bodyweight, sedation, blood lipids, serum prolactin and liver transaminase levels than olanzapine-treated adults. Therefore, careful consideration of risk-benefit is recommended before using olanzapine in adolescents.", 
    "52": "The success of high-dose buprenorphine (HDB) as substitution therapy for major opioid dependence is related to its partial agonist effect on opioid receptors, which in theory makes it very safe to use. However, numerous deaths directly attributable to buprenorphine have been described in the literature. These deaths are generally related to misuse of HDB with intravenous administration and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines, and they usually occur in patients on HDB substitution therapy for opioid dependence. We present three deaths attributed to HDB which arose from uncommon mechanisms and led to unusual forensic situations. The first death was that of a patient admitted to hospital after simultaneous prescription of HDB, clonazepam, oxazepam, and cyamemazine. The second death followed forcible administration of a very low dose of HDB to a patient with post-hepatitis C cirrhosis and heart failure. The third death was subsequent to an HDB overdose, probably with suicidal intent, in a young woman who had not been prescribed the drug as opiate substitute. Such deaths raise the question of the mechanisms involved and draw attention to the resulting unusual forensic situations.", 
    "53": "Intestinal first-pass metabolism may contribute to low oral drug bioavailability and drug-drug interactions, particularly for CYP3A substrates. The current analysis predicted intestinal availability (F(G)) from in vitro metabolic clearance and permeability data of 25 drugs using the Q(Gut) model. The drug selection included a wide range of physicochemical properties and in vivo F(G) values (0.07-0.94). In vitro clearance data (CLu(int)) were determined in human intestinal (HIM) and three liver (HLM) microsomal pools (n = 105 donors) using the substrate depletion method. Apparent drug permeability (P(app)) was determined in Caco-2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with human MDR1 gene (MDCK-MDR1 cells) under isotonic conditions (pH = 7.4). In addition, effective permeability (P(eff)) data, estimated from regression analyses to P(app) or physicochemical properties were used in the F(G) predictions. Determined CLu(int) values ranged from 0.022 to 76.7 microl/min/pmol of CYP3A (zolpidem and nisoldipine, respectively). Differences in CLu(int) values obtained in HIM and HLM were not significant after normalization for tissue-specific CYP3A abundance, supporting their interchangeable usability. The F(G) predictions were most successful when P(app) data from Caco-2/MDCK-MDR1 cells were used directly; in contrast, the use of physicochemical parameters resulted in significant F(G) underpredictions. Good agreement between predicted and in vivo F(G) was noted for drugs with low to medium intestinal extraction (e.g., midazolam predicted F(G) value 0.54 and in vivo value 0.51). In contrast, low prediction accuracy was observed for drugs with in vivo F(G) <0.5, resulting in considerable underprediction in some instances, as for saquinavir (predicted F(G) is 6% of the observed value). Implications of the findings are discussed.", 
    "54": "The GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)R) is the major inhibitory receptor in the mammalian central nervous system and the target of numerous pharmaceuticals. The alpha-subunit of these pentameric Cys-loop neurotransmitter-gated ion channels contributes to the binding of both GABA and allosteric modulators such as the benzodiazepines, suggesting a role for this subunit in the conformational changes associated with activation of the receptor. Herein we use the nonsense suppression methodology to incorporate a photoactivatable unnatural amino acid and photochemically cleave the backbone of the alpha subunit of the alpha(1)beta(2) GABA(A)R in a linker region that is believed to span the subunit. Proteolytic cleavage impairs GABA but not pentobarbital activation, strongly suggesting that conformational changes involving this linker region are critical to the GABA activation pathway.",

In the present study methanolic extracts from flowers and leaves of Cirsium rivulare containing flavonoid compounds linarin, pectolinarin, apigenin, hispidulin, their glycosides and a newly isolated compound isokaemferide 7-O-(6''-methylglucuronide) were studied for anxiolytic and pro-cognitive properties.", 
    "60": "Male Wistar rats (150-160 g) were used. They were treated orally with standardized methanol extracts of flowers and leaves of Cirsium rivulare and subsequently tested for memory in passive avoidance (PA) and object recognition (OR) tests. Auxiliary tests for motor (open field, OF) and emotional (elevated 'plus' maze, EPM) effects of the above treatments were also employed.", 
    "61": "We found that the extract from flowers of Cirsium rivulare, in addition to its anxiolytic effects as measured in the EPM, improves memory of the appetitively (by curiosity, OR) and aversively (by footshook, PA) motivated tasks. This is in contrast to classical anxiolytics as for example benzodiazepines that typically impair memory. The extract from leaves of Cirsium rivulare showed some anxiolytic properties in the EPM, and no effect in both cognitive tests. The examined extracts of Cirsium rivulare did not affect psychomotor exploratory activity of rats tested in the OF.",

    "63": "Excitotoxin induces neurodegeneration via glutamatergic activation or oxidative stress, which means that the blockade of glutamate receptors and the scavenging of free radicals are potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases. Sinapic acid (SA) has a GABA(A) receptor agonistic property and free radical scavenging activity. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of SA on kainic acid (KA)-induced hippocampal brain damage in mice. SA (10 mg/kg) by oral administration has an anticonvulsant effect on KA-induced seizure-like behavior. Moreover, SA (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated KA-induced neuronal cell death in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions when administered as late as 6 h after KA. In addition, flumazenil, a GABA(A) antagonist, blocked the effect of SA administered immediately after KA but not the effect of SA administered 6 h after KA. This late protective effect of SA was accompanied by reduced levels of reactive gliosis, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and nitrotyrosine formation in the hippocampus. In the passive avoidance task, KA-induced memory impairments were ameliorated by SA. These results suggest that the potential therapeutic effect of SA is due to its attenuation of KA-induced neuronal damage in the brain via its anti-convulsive activity through GABA(A) receptor activation and radical scavenging activity.",

Moreover, the treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice in the absence of class I or II level of evidence. Here we assessed the role of benzodiazepines in the conservative management of acute lumbar disc prolapse. Using a placebo-controlled, double-blinded design, 60 patients were randomized to receive placebo or diazepam in addition to mechanical physiotherapy and analgesics for the first 7 days of conservative treatment of clinically and radiologically confirmed lumbar disc prolapse. The primary objective was to evaluate if physiotherapy plus analgesics, but without benzodiazepines, is equivalent to the same therapy plus benzodiazepines. The primary endpoint was centralization of referred pain at day 7. Twenty-six female and 34 male patients were enrolled. The median age was 42 years (range 22-68 years). Analysis of the primary endpoint demonstrated equivalence between placebo and diazepam (median 60% vs. 50% reduction of distance of referred pain at day 7) within the predefined equivalence tolerance of 20% at a significance level of p<0.05. Regarding the secondary endpoints, the median duration of the stay in hospital was shorter in the placebo arm (8 vs. 10 days, p=0.008), and the probability of pain reduction on a visual analog scale by more than 50% was twice as high in placebo patients (p<0.0015). Benzodiazepines should not be used routinely in patients treated with mechanical physiotherapy for lumbar disc prolapse.",

Two trials show trends for topiramate's superiority over oral naltrexone in alcohol dependence, while 1 trial suggests topiramate is inferior to disulfiram. Despite suggestive animal models, evidence for topiramate in treating alcohol withdrawal in humans is slim. Studies of topiramate in nicotine dependence show mixed results. Human laboratory studies that used acute topiramate dosing show that topiramate actually enhances the pleasurable effects of both nicotine and methamphetamine. Evidence for topiramate in the treatment of cocaine dependence is promising, but limited by small sample size. The data on opioids, benzodiazepines, and Ecstasy are sparse.", 
    "71": "Topiramate is efficacious for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but side effects may limit widespread use. While topiramate's unique pharmacodynamic profile offers a promising theoretical rationale for use across multiple substance-related disorders, heterogeneity both across and within these disorders limits topiramate's broad applicability in treating substance-related disorders.

The study objective was to define the electrocardiographic (ECG) predictors of adverse cardiovascular events (ACVE) complicating suspected acute poisoning (SAP). This was a case-control study in adults at three tertiary-care hospitals and one regional Poison Control Center. We compared 34 cases of SAP complicated by ACVE to 101 consecutive control patients with uncomplicated SAP. The initial ECG was analyzed for rhythm, intervals, QT dispersion, ischemia, and infarction. ECGs were interpreted by a cardiologist, blinded to study hypothesis and case data. Subjects were 48% male, with mean age 42 +/- 19 years. In addition to clinical suspicion of poisoning in 100% of patients, routine toxicology screens were positive in 77%, most commonly for benzodiazepines, opioids, and/or acetaminophen. Neither the ventricular rate, the QRS duration, nor the presence of infarction predicted the risk of ACVE. However, the rhythm, QTc, QT dispersion, and presence of ischemia correlated with the risk of ACVE. Independent predictors of ACVE based on multivariable logistic regression were prolonged QTc, any non-sinus rhythm, ventricular ectopy, and ischemia. Recursive partitioning analysis identified very low risk criteria (94.1% sensitivity, 96.2% NPV) and high risk criteria (95% specificity). Among patients with SAP, the presence of QTc prolongation, QT dispersion, ventricular ectopy, any non-sinus rhythm, and evidence of ischemia on the initial ECG are strongly associated with ACVE.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that antipsychotic medication affects both subcortical and cortical grey and white matter volumes. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of antipsychotic medication on two white matter tracts: a subcortical-cortical tract, the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule; and a cortical-cortical tract, the corpus callosum. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on 10 chronic schizophrenia patients treated with typical antipsychotics and 20 healthy controls at baseline. Patients were switched to olanzapine and both groups were rescanned after 1 year. At baseline, the volume of the anterior limb of the internal capsule was 24% smaller in typical-treated patients than controls (p = 0.009). Patients treated with greater amounts of chlorpromazine-equivalent daily dosage had smaller anterior internal capsule volumes at baseline (r =\u2009-0.65, p = 0.04). At follow-up, after being switched to olanzapine, there were no significant differences between patients and controls. Patients with schizophrenia had a significant 25% increase in anterior internal capsule volume from baseline to follow-up compared with controls (p = 0.04). These effects were most prominent in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, which consists of fronto-thalamic pathways, and were not statistically significant in the posterior limb of the internal capsule or corpus callosum.

Drugs most commonly targeted include amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and the opiates, but can be any other illicit substance or almost any over-the-counter or prescribed drug, as well as poisons available to the community. The discipline requires high level skills in analytical techniques with a solid knowledge of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. Modern techniques rely heavily on immunoassay screening analyses and mass spectrometry (MS) for confirmatory analyses using either high-performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography as the separation technique. Tandem MS has become more and more popular compared to single-stage MS. It is essential that analytical systems are fully validated and fit for the purpose and the assay batches are monitored with quality controls. External proficiency programs monitor both the assay and the personnel performing the work. For a laboratory to perform optimally, it is vital that the circumstances and context of the case are known and the laboratory understands the limitations of the analytical systems used, including drug stability. Drugs and poisons can change concentration postmortem due to poor or unequal quality of blood and other specimens, anaerobic metabolism and redistribution. The latter provides the largest handicap in the interpretation of postmortem results.", 
    "112": "It has been reported many times that the commercial mixtures of chiral selectors (CS), namely highly sulfated beta-CDs (HS-beta-CDs), provide remarkable enantioselectivity in CZE when compared with single-isomer CDs, even single-isomer HS-beta-CDs. This enhanced enantioselectivity of multi-CS enantioseparative CZE is discussed in the light of multi-CS model that we have introduced earlier. It is proposed on a theoretical basis and verified experimentally that the two enantiomers of a chiral analyte under interaction with a mixture of CSs are very likely to differ in their limit mobilities, which is opposite to single-CS systems where the two limit mobilities are likely to be the same. Thus while the enantioseparation is usually controlled by different distribution constants between the two enantiomers and CS used in single-CS systems, an additional, electrophoretic, enantioselective mechanism resulting from different limit mobilities may play a significant role in multi-CS systems. This additional mechanism generally makes the multi-CS systems more selective than the single-CS systems. The possible inequality of limit mobilities is also significant for optimization of separation conditions using mixtures of CSs. A practical example supporting our considerations is shown on enantioseparation of lorazepam in the presence of a commercial mixture of HS-beta-CDs and a single-isomer HS-beta-CD, heptakis(6-O-sulfo)-beta-CD.",

Most commonly reported effects were tachycardia (n=23), agitation (n=14), anxiety (n=11), headache (n=8), hypertension (n=6), dystonia/tremor (n=6), and dizziness (n=5). Forty-nine patients (56%) were managed at home, and 38 (44%) were managed in a healthcare setting. Therapies administered included activated charcoal (n=8), benzodiazepines (n=7), antihistamines (n=2), intravenous fluids (n=2), haloperidol (n=2), and beta-blockers (n=1). Effects were classified as none (n=22), minor (n=54), and moderate (n=11). No major effects and no deaths occurred. Effects of modafinil overdose appear to be mild in most cases, with tachycardia and CNS symptoms predominating. Clinically significant effects requiring treatment occurred in a small number of patients.",

The utilization of an organized micellar medium provided enhanced fluorescence emission. The results allowed to obtain a linear working range for diazepam concentrations of up to 40 mg L(-1) (r = 0.9998) and the detection limit was about 0.97 mg L(-1). The results obtained by the miniaturized and automatic flow system were in agreement with those furnished by the reference procedure, with relative deviations comprised between -2.09% and 2.13%.",

The difference in the need for postoperative ventilation (43% vs 19%; P<.05) as well as the number of cases with hypoxemia (54% vs 21%; P<.05) was significant, compared with the group of infants treated with cryotherapy with those treated with laser coagulation.",

The aim of the pharmacological control of a severe hypertension is to allow a moderate reduction of the mean arterial blood pressure as well as dampening the large pressure variations. Boluses of calcium channel inhibitors, eventually combined with labetalol, are to be used as first line treatment. Systematic fluid expansion prior to admission is not recommended. However, it is indicated if obvious signs of hypovolaemia are present, such as a sudden drop in blood pressure, secondary to the initiating of an antihypertensive therapy. It is possible to use i.v. benzodiazepines for the treatment of eclampsia in the prehospital setting. If magnesium sulfate therapy has been initiated in a preeclamptic woman with neurological signs, it may be continued during her transport.", 
    "120": "The muscle relaxant rocuronium and the hypnotics etomidate, diazepam and midazolam were candidate poisons in a case of a suspected series of fatal intoxications in a hospital. A robust, specific and sensitive multi-target screening procedure was established to identify unequivocally the parent compounds and diagnostic metabolites and artefacts in putrefied specimens, obtained from exhumed bodies. The analytical findings of relevant compounds could be traced partially back to authorised therapeutic measures, whereas the identification of rocuronium proved potentially lethal intoxications in 13 (of a total number of 42) cases. Moreover, the detection of certain hypnotics revealed an improper administration of these compounds in another nine cases, which suggested manipulation but was not indicative of fatal intoxications. Quantitative estimations of substance concentrations were highly correlated with the post-mortem time intervals and did not reveal any information on doses, initial serum concentrations or toxicological effects.", 
    "121": "Workplace drug testing is a well-established application of forensic toxicology and it aims to reduce workplace accidents caused by affected workers. Several classes of abused substances may be involved, such as alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, opiates and also prescription drugs, such as benzodiazepines. The use of alternative biological specimens such as hair, oral fluid or sweat in workplace drug testing presents several advantages over urinalysis-mainly the fact that sample collection can be performed easily without infringing on the examinee's privacy, so the subject is more likely to perform the test. However, drugs are usually present in these alternative specimens at low concentrations and the amount of sample available for analysis is small. The use of highly sensitive techniques is therefore necessary. In fact, the successful interface of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has brought a new light into bioanalytical and forensic sciences as it allows the detection of drugs and metabolites at concentrations that are difficult to analyse using the more commonly adopted GC-MS based techniques. This paper will discuss the importance of LC-MS in supporting workplace drug-testing programmes. The combination of LC-MS with innovative instrumentation such as triple quadrupoles, ion traps and time-of-flight mass spectrometers will also be focused.",

In 24 cases, patients used both aspirin and oral anticoagulants, while in 41 cases, medication was corrected according to index. GHQ-12 seemed to be significantly worse in paroxysmal and persistent cases, as well as in women with recurrent AF. Many paroxysmal AF patients under 75 years continued caffeine intake, whereas an extensive use of benzodiazepines was noticed in the majority of patients.", 
    "131": "Shortages and limitations of the peripheral or rural units and health centers and inadequate knowledge and application of the guidelines, seemed to be major factors responsible for mismanaging AF patients.

    "139": "We identified 10 studies in which the authors examined drug dosing or pharmacokinetics for obese children. No information was found for drug absorption or metabolism. Obese children have a higher percent fat mass and a lower percent lean mass compared with normal-weight children. Therefore, in obese children, the volume of distribution of lipophilic drugs is most likely higher, and that of hydrophilic drugs is most likely lower, than in normal-weight children. Serum creatinine concentrations are higher in obese than normal-weight children. Total body weight is an appropriate size descriptor for calculating doses of antineoplastics, cefazolin, and succinylcholine in obese children. Initial tobramycin doses may be determined using an adjusted body weight, although using total body weight in the context of monitoring serum tobramycin concentrations would also be an appropriate strategy. We found no information for any of the opioids; antibiotics such as penicillins, carbapenems, vancomycin, and linezolid; antifungals; cardiac drugs such as digoxin and amiodarone; corticosteroids; benzodiazepines; and anticonvulsants. In particular, we found no information about medications that are widely distributed to adipose tissue or that can accumulate there.", 
    "140": "The available data are limited because of the small numbers of participating children, study design, or both. The number and type of drugs that have been studied limit our understanding of the pharmacokinetics in obese children. In the absence of dosing information for obese children, it is important to consider the nature and severity of a child's illness, comorbidities, organ function, and side effects and physiochemical properties of the drug. Extrapolating from available adult data is possible, as long as practitioners consider the effects of growth and development on the pharmacokinetics relevant to the child's age.",

    "145": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of liver failure, characterized neuropathologically by astrocyte swelling, microglial activation and Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis. Molecular studies in HE brain reveal altered expression of genes coding for key astroglial proteins including early losses of expression of GFAP and the glutamate transporter EEAT-2 with concomitant increases of the astrocytic/microglial mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). Decreased expression of EAAT-2 results in decreased glutamate transport and impaired cycling of glutamate-glutamine between astrocytes and neurons, as well as increased extracellular glutamate, activation of the NMDA receptor-mediated cGMP-NO signal transduction pathway, and nitration of tyrosine residues on key astroglial proteins such as glutamine synthetase (GS) and the MBR. GS is uniquely responsible for the removal of excess ammonia in brain. Ammonia-induced activation of MBR in astrocytes and/or microglia results in stimulation of the synthesis of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone with positive allosteric GABA-A receptor neuromodulatory properties. Allopregnanolone concentrations are increased up to 7-fold in HE brain. Attenuation of microglial activation by minocycline results in a delay in onset of HE and prevents brain edema in liver failure. Mild hypothermia is likewise beneficial in acute liver failure resulting in normalization of extracellular brain glutamate and prevention of oxidative/nitrosative stress in experimental animals with HE resulting from either ischemic or toxic liver injuries.", 
    "146": "Inflammatory/immunological process and glial contribution are suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We investigated peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in brains of patients with chronic schizophrenia, which were reported to be located on mitochondria of glial cells, using [11C]DAA1106 with positron emission tomography. Fourteen patients and 14 age- and sex-matched normal controls participated in this study. PET data were analysed by two-tissue compartment model with metabolite-corrected plasma input. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. There was no significant difference between [11C]DAA1106 binding of the cortical regions of normal controls and patients with schizophrenia, whereas the patients showed a positive correlation between cortical [11C]DAA1106 binding and positive symptom scores. There was also a positive correlation between [11C]DAA1106 binding and duration of illness. Although the correlations need to be interpreted very cautiously, involvement of glial reaction process in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms or progressive change of schizophrenia might be suggested.", 
    "147": "Methadone has a long and successful history in the treatment of opioid addiction. In recent years, it has become popular again--as potent and inexpensive analgesic in patients with chronic pain. Since methadone has been used fatalities have been reported. In our study all methadone-associated deaths in Zurich from 1998 to 2007 were analysed. Most of the 146 detected deaths of the past 10 years occurred during substitution programmes or illicit intake of methadone while only three of them could be attributed to methadone used as an analgesic. Noticeable in our study was the high percentage of cases of combined drug intoxication (76%). The most frequent co-intoxicants were alcohol and cocaine. Mortalities attributed to methadone intoxication alone were a rare finding and could only be detected in five cases of deceased who had received methadone maintenance treatment. The aim of our study is to assess the trends in the number and nature of methadone-related fatalities in Zurich during the last 19 years. For this purpose a previous study from Zurich (1989-1997) was included, whereby a very long observation period and large number of cases resulted.", 
    "148": "Benzodiazepines are probably prescribed too often to people with substance abuse problems. The drugs often alleviate symptoms effectively on a short term, but pharmacodynamic interactions and development of dependence cause problems. Indistinct, but important side effects might be overlooked or misunderstood. Evidence-based practice should replace prescriptions based on unclear indications.", 
    "149": "A series of experiments used rats to study the effect of a systemic or intra-amygdala infusion of the benzodiazepine, midazolam, on learning and re-learning to inhibit context conditioned fear (freezing) responses. Rats were subjected to two context-conditioning episodes followed by extinction under drug or vehicle, or to two cycles of context conditioning and extinction with the second extinction under drug or vehicle. A 20-min extinction under vehicle resulted in better long-term inhibition on a subsequent drug-free retention test than a 4-min extinction under vehicle, or a 20-min, as well as a 4-min, extinction under drug. However, a 20-min, as well as a 4-min, second extinction under drug was just as effective in producing long-term inhibition as a 20-min second extinction under vehicle and this inhibition was greater than that produced by a 4-min second extinction under vehicle. Initial extinction of 5, 10, or 20 min were equally effective in producing long-term inhibition when the second extinction under drug was 20 min; and 5-, 10-, or 20-min second extinction under drug were equally effective in producing long-term inhibition when the initial extinction was 5 min. A 4- or 20-min second extinction under an infusion of drug into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was as effective in producing long-term inhibition as a 20-min second extinction under vehicle and was more effective than a 4-min second extinction under vehicle. The results show that midazolam impairs learning to inhibit fear responses but spares and even facilitates re-learning this inhibition.", 
    "150": "In order to overcome the stop marketing by Biorad company of automated high performance liquid chromatograph with UV detection (Remedi), we developed a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to detect and to give an approximation of the overdose of molecules frequently encountered in drug intoxications. Therefore two hundred eighty seventeen blood samples were collected over a period of one year and allowed us to evaluate and compare the performance of these two techniques. As identification, GC-MS does not identify all molecules detected by Remedi in 24.2% of cases; there is a lack of sensitivity for opiates and the systematic absence of certain molecules such as betablockers. However, in 75.8% of cases the GC-MS detects all molecules found by Remedi and other molecules such as meprobamate, paracetamol, benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. The concentrations obtained are interpreted in terms of overdose showed 15.7% of discrepancy and 84.3% of concordance between the two techniques. The GC-MS technique described here is robust, fast and relatively simple to implement; the identification is facilitated by macro commands and the semi quantification remains manual. Despite a sequence of cleaning the column after each sample, carryover of a sample to the next remains possible. This technique can be used for toxicologic screening in acute intoxications. Nevertheless it must be supplemented by a HPLC with UV detection if molecules such as betablockers are suspected.", 
    "151": "NMDA receptors mediate hypoxia-induced ventilatory frequency and blood pressure increases in fish. Here we continue to resolve whether non-NMDA receptors participate in chemoreflexes. Shorthorn sculpins, instrumented for cardiorespiratory measurements, were kept unrestrained or positioned in a stereotaxic frame. Chemoreflexes were elicited (hypoxia/NaCN-induced) before/after administration of either the specific AMPA receptor antagonist, GYKI52466 (systemically), or the specific kainate receptor antagonist, UBP293 (microinjections into fourth ventricle). Immunohistochemistry was performed on medullary cross-sections to identify non-NMDA receptor subunits in the chemoreflex-pathway. Kainate receptors mediate the chemoreflex-mediated increase in ventilation amplitude, since the response was abolished by UBP293. GYKI52466 attenuated the ventilatory frequency increase, and induced more regular breathing patterns and higher heart rate in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, suggesting that AMPA receptors also partake in cardiorespiratory control. This together with immunohistochemical findings of both AMPA and kainate receptor subunits in the chemoreflex-pathway, show that non-NMDA receptors play a role in both chemoreflex-activation and normoxic cardiorespiratory regulation in fish.", 
    "152": "During pregnancy, the maternal, placental and fetal physiological characteristics constantly evolve and thereby constantly alter drug bioavailability in the mother and feto-placental unit. Gastric emptying time is increased and bowel movements are reduced. Distribution in the maternal body is mainly influenced by body mass variations, water content and fat stores. Metabolic capacity of the liver appears unchanged but renal clearance of drugs is gradually increased. The placental transfer of most drugs mainly consists of passive diffusion between the maternal and fetal circulations, along their respective concentration gradients. Only the free, unbound and non-ionized fraction of the drug readily crosses the membranes. Four anti-hypertensive drugs have been granted a license for the treatment of PE since the year 2000: these are Clonidine (Catapressan), Nicardipine (Loxen+), Labetalol (Trandate), Dihydralazine (Nepressol). Dihydralazine, Labetalol and Nicardipine are not contraindicated in the breast feeding mother. The administration of a long acting Benzodiazepine during pregnancy can lead to new born intoxication of variable severity and duration. These symptoms may precede a withdrawal syndrome (hyper-excitability, tremor, gastro-intestinal upset, such as diarrhea or vomiting). Breast feeding by mothers using benzodiazepines (Nitrazepam and Midazolam) is not recommended. In France, the use of low molecular weight heparins is not recommended during pregnancy whereas in the United States, they are recommended as a prophylactic measure. Their high molecular weight prevents their diffusion across the placental membrane and therefore prevents any fetal or neonatal risk. Bromocriptine is used as an inhibitor of lactation. During the post-partum period, serious accidents have been described: these consist of systemic hypertension, fits, infarcts (cardiac and neurological). It is contraindicated in case of systemic hypertension.", 
    "153": "Agricultural application of sewage sludge has been emotionally discussed in the last decades, because the latter contains organic micropollutants with unknown fate and risk potential. In this work, the reuse of anaerobically digested sludge in agriculture is evaluated from an environmental point of view by using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. More specifically, the potential impacts of emerging micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, present in the sludge have been quantified. Four scenarios were considered according to the temperature of the anaerobic digestion (mesophilic or thermophilic) and the sludge retention time (20 or 10d), and they have been compared with the non-treated sludge. From an environmental point of view, the disposal of undigested sludge is not the most suitable alternative, except for global warming due to the dominance (65-85%) of the indirect emissions associated to the electricity use. Nutrient-related direct emissions dominate the eutrophication category impact in all the scenarios (>71.4%), although a beneficial impact related to the avoidance of industrial fertilisers production is also quantified (up to 6.7%). In terms of human and terrestrial toxicity, the direct emissions of heavy metals to soil dominate these two impact categories (>70%), and the contribution of other micropollutants is minimal. Moreover, only six (Galaxolide, Tonalide, Diazepam, Ibuprofen, Sulfamethoxazole and 17alpha-ethinyloestradiol) out of the 13 substances considered are really significant since they account for more than 95% of the overall micropollutants impact.", 
    "154": "Gonadal steroids, in particular estradiol, exert important actions during pre- and perinatal periods in the regulation of sexual dimorphism and development of the nervous system. We have now examined the effects of neonatal estradiol administration in female rats on brain concentrations of the neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits, and behavioral sensitivity to benzodiazepines and allopregnanolone. Administration of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate on the day of birth resulted in marked decreases in the concentrations of progesterone and allopregnanolone in the cerebral cortex at 21, 60, and 180 days after birth. The concentrations of tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, 17beta-estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone in the brain at 60 days were not affected by such treatment. Neonatal administration of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate also increased the cerebrocortical abundance of alpha(1), alpha(2), and gamma(2) subunits of the GABA(A) receptor without affecting that of alpha(3), alpha(4), alpha(5), or delta subunits. Diazepam induced a greater reduction in locomotor activity as well as a more pronounced anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze test in rats subjected to neonatal treatment with beta-estradiol 3-benzoate than in vehicle-treated controls, while allopregnanolone induced a similar effect in both groups. These effects of estradiol suggest that it plays a major role in regulation both of GABAergic transmission and of the abundance of endogenous modulators of such transmission during development of the central nervous system.", 
    "155": "Orofacial movements are regulated by D(1)-like dopamine receptors interacting with additional mechanisms. Phospholipase C-related catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) regulates cell surface expression of GABA(A) receptors containing a gamma2 subunit. Mutant mice with double knockout of PRIP-1 and PRIP-2 were used to investigate aspects of GABAergic regulation of orofacial movements and interactions with D(1) mechanisms. Vertical jaw movements, tongue protrusions and movements of the head and vibrissae were reduced in PRIP-1/2 double knockouts. The GABA(A)ergic agent diazepam reduced movements of the head and vibrissae; these effects were unaltered in PRIP-1/2 double knockouts. The D(1)-like agonist SKF 83959 induced vertical jaw movements, incisor chattering, and movements of the head and vibrissae that were unaltered in PRIP-1/2 double knockouts. However, SKF 83959-induced tongue protrusions were reduced in PRIP-1/2 double knockouts. PRIP-mediated regulation of GABA(A)ergic receptor mechanisms influences topographically distinct aspects of orofacial movement and interacts with D(1) receptor systems.", 
    "156": "The study was conducted to test the aqueous extract of Brugmansia suaveolens (AEBs) flowers for their antinociceptive effects in mice. In the hot plate test, a significant increase in reaction time for two doses of AEBs at 60, 90, 120, and 150 min after treatment was noted. Pretreatment of animals with naloxone (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [IP]) left the antinociceptive effect of AEBs at a dose of 100 mg/kg unaffected at 60, 90, 120, and 150 min after treatment and at a dose of 300 mg/kg at 30 min but not at 90, 120, and 150 min. In the writhing test, the AEBs significantly inhibited acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction and was equally potent at both doses. Pretreatment with naloxone (5 mg/kg, IP) left the antinociceptive effect of both doses of AEBs unaffected. Pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 20 mg/kg, IP) caused a significant change in the number of abdominal constrictions but did not change the antinociceptive effect of AEBs. Pretreatment of animals with methylene blue also did not change the effect of AEBs on the number of writhing movements in mice. Flumazenil (5 mg/kg, IP) antagonized the antinociceptive effects of diazepam and also reversed the antinociceptive effect of AEBs. AEBs showed a depressant effect on the central nervous system, and the treatment of mice with pentobarbital combined with AEBs increased the animals' sleeping time in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the antinociceptive activity of AEBs may be related in part to benzodiazepine receptors, although peripheral mechanisms cannot be excluded.", 
    "157": "We describe a rare case of Influenza B-associated encephalopathy with hemorrhagic lesions of the corpus callosum. A 12-year-old Caucasian girl presented a 24-h fever followed by partial seizure, secondarily generalized, and disturbance of consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging on Day 2 of her illness showed two hemorrhagic lesions of the corpus callosum. The Influenza B virus was found on nasopharyngeal swab. Neurologic signs had completely recovered by Day 3. A review of the literature identified a few similar cases; the common features include a relatively older age and prompt and complete recovery from clinical symptoms.

    "158": "This work investigates whether the two 1,5-benzodiazepine compounds: 4-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-one (RG0501) and Benzopyrano [4,3-c] 1,5-benzodiazepine (RG0502) have any neuropharmacological activities. Diazepam and Flunitrazepam were used as drug references. The investigational 1,5-BDZ were tested in vivo for potentiating hexobarbital-induced sleep and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. Our study demonstrated that the increase of sleep duration was significantly higher with RG0501 as compared to RG0502. However, RG0502 anticonvulsant effect was more pronounced than that of RG0501 in the range dose of 6.25-37.5 mg.kg(-1). From the 50 mg.kg(-1) dose, RG0502 offered a protection against clonic-tonic seizures as well as lethality (p< or =0.05). The results showed that the required doses to obtain a pharmacological activity were more than those of the references. This difference could be related to the lack of specific substituants responsible for the pharmacological activity in the tested compounds.",

Treatment of PTSD presents a challenge on every level. This literature review provides some insight into the risks and benefits of three groups of drugs commonly prescribed for combat-induced PTSD: beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines (BZDs). When prescribed in conjunction with other non-pharmacological treatments, these drugs help to minimize, and in some cases eliminate, the signs and symptoms of PTSD. Combination therapy would ideally result in better compliance and eventual completion of treatment programmes provided for PTSD sufferers. Healthcare professionals strive to provide patients with holistic care. Patients present with unique mental and physical intricacies, and nurses and health professionals must peel away the layers to uncover the nature of the PTSD. While there are many aspects to PTSD treatment, this literature review focuses on pharmacological treatment, specifically beta-blockers, SSRIs and BZDs.",

Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were dispensed at least one dose of a SAIM antipsychotic were divided into groups based on the initial SAIM antipsychotic received once admitted to a psychiatric unit. Electronic records were used to gather demographic information, LOS, and number of injections received during an admission. Cost was calculated from the number of injections received. One-hundred and thirty-six patients were enrolled. When comparing the haloperidol group to the second generation antipsychotic group, there was no statistically significant difference, in LOS 16.98 \u00b1 9.56 days versus 17.59 \u00b1 11.52 days (P = 0.75), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in both cost and number of injections between groups, favoring the haloperidol group. Ziprasidone was associated with a shorter LOS compared with olanzapine, 13.57 and 19.10 days, respectively (P = 0.026). Patient characteristics should be evaluated when determining an agent for acute agitation. However, because literature indicates second generation SAIM antipsychotics are only noninferior to haloperidol; other factors should also be evaluated; including impact on LOS and impact on hospital resources. This study indicates use of a second generation SAIM antipsychotic for acute agitation is more costly, requires more injections, and was not associated with a shorter length of stay when compared with SAIM haloperidol.",

Therefore, an animal model of these side effects was developed in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Chronic administration of olanzapine elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, increased fat mass but, in contrast to female rats, did not increase body weight or food intake. Acute studies were conducted to delineate the mechanisms responsible for these effects. Olanzapine markedly decreased physical activity without a compensatory decline in food intake. It also acutely elevated fasting glucose and worsened oral glucose and insulin tolerance, suggesting that these effects are adiposity independent. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies measuring (14)C-2-deoxyglucose uptake revealed tissue-specific insulin resistance. Insulin sensitivity was impaired in skeletal muscle, but either unchanged or increased in adipose tissue depots. Consistent with the olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia, there was a tendency for increased (14)C-2-deoxyglucose uptake into fat depots of fed rats and, surprisingly, free fatty acid (FFA) uptake into fat depots was elevated approximately twofold. The increased glucose and FFA uptake into adipose tissue was coupled with increased adipose tissue lipogenesis. Finally, olanzapine lowered fasting plasma FFA, and as it had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated rises in plasma glucose, it blunted isoproterenol-stimulated in vivo lipolysis in fed rats. Collectively, these results suggest that olanzapine exerts several metabolic effects that together favor increased accumulation of fuel into adipose tissue, thereby increasing adiposity.",

This was followed by a maintenance infusion of DEX versus a normal saline infusion for the control group. Midazolam was given in 0.5 mg increments to maintain an equivalent target level of sedation among the 3 study groups. Fentanyl was given in 25 microg increments to treat pain as needed. The percentage of DEX patients not requiring MDZ and the total dose of MDZ and fentanyl were compared to the control. Dexmedetomidine was efficacious as a sole sedative for 50% of patients.

In the elevated plus-maze test, intra-lateral septal infusions of NPY (3.0 microg/microl, P<0.05; 3.5 microg/microl, P<0.05) or midazolam (10.0 microg/microl; P<0.05) or systemic injections of topiramate (20.0mg/kg, P<0.05; 30.0mg/kg, P<0.05) or subthreshold doses of systemic injections of topiramate (10.0mg/kg) combined with intra-lateral septal infusions of subthreshold doses of NPY (2.5 microg/microl; P<0.05) increased the exploration of the open arms without affecting locomotion. In conclusion, intra-septal NPY has anxiolytic effects in the EPM, and antidepressant effects in the DRL 72s test. Similarly, systemic topiramate has anxiolytic effects in the EPM, and antidepressant effects in the DRL 72s test. Finally, a combination of subthreshold doses of NPY and topiramate together also have anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, suggesting a synergistic effect.",

However, the effects which are manifested in negative schizophrenia symptoms or in the patients' cognitive functioning, favour the atypical antipsychotics. When it comes to adding the subjective well-being of the patients and their improvement of the quality of life, then, the advantages of atypical antipsychotics are unquestionable. New trends in medicine are increasingly impinge on the pharmacoeconomy, which aims at reducing treatment cost. This trend is getting progressively stronger in the world and as such, it certainly will not bypass Croatia. Pharmacists and General Practice doctors (GP) are permitted, by the law, to replace the original medicament prescribed by a specialist doctor, with a cheaper one from the same generic group of medicaments, with a purpose of cutting down the treatment costs.

He has been on a treatment with atypical antipsychotics and has kept in a good and stable remission for the past seven years. His therapy consisted of olanzapine in a dose of 15 mg in the evening, throughout the whole period of his 7-year remission. A month ago, his GP doctor self- initially prescribed a generic olanzapine.

One approach has been to develop compounds that inhibit reuptake of all three monoamines in the central nervous system, for example DOV216,303. Differential reinforcement of low-rate (72-s) responding is a behavioral test that is predictive of antidepressant-like properties. The effects of antidepressant compounds belonging to multiple classes, the anxiolytic diazepam and the antipsychotic haloperidol, were assessed in the DRL-72s task. Subsequently, the antidepressant-like properties of acute DOV216,303 were assessed. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, the preferential norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine exhibited antidepressant-like properties in the DRL-72s task. The atypical antidepressant bupropion, which inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, and the selective dopamine transporter inhibitor GBR12909, changed reinforcement and response rates and inter-response time distribution in an opposite direction compared with the antidepressant compounds tested. The antipsychotic haloperidol exhibited antidepressant-like properties by increasing reinforcement rate, but failed to alter inter-response time distribution. Diazepam did not change reinforcement or response rates or inter-response time distribution. The triple reuptake inhibitor DOV216,303 significantly enhanced reinforcement rate at one intermediate dose, but exhibited similar effects as bupropion and GBR12909 on inter-response time distribution. The studies identified limited antidepressant-like properties of the triple reuptake inhibitor DOV216,303, likely due to dopamine transporter inhibition counteracting the effects of norepinephrine and serotonin transporter inhibition.", 
    "210": "Imidazoles and triazoles represent major classes of antifungal azole derivatives. With respect to UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, the drug metabolism focus has mainly concentrated on their inhibitory effects with little known about azoles as substrates for UGTs. N-Glucuronide metabolites of the imidazole antifungals, tioconazole and croconazole, have been reported, but there are currently no reports of N-glucuronidation of triazole antifungal agents. In this study, evidence for glucuronidation of azole-containing compounds was studied in human liver microsomes (HLM). When a glucuronide metabolite was identified, azoles were incubated in 12 recombinant UGT (rUGT) enzymes, and enzyme kinetics were determined for the UGT with the most intense glucuronide peak. Six imidazole antifungals, three triazoles, and the benzodiazepine alprazolam (triazole) were evaluated in this study. All compounds investigated were identified as substrates of UGT. UGT1A4 was the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of all compounds except for fluconazole, which was mainly metabolized by UGT2B7, probably mediating its O-glucuronide metabolism. UGT1A3 was also found to be involved in the metabolism of all imidazoles but not triazoles. In both HLM and rUGT K(m) values were lower for imidazoles (14.8-144 microM) than for triazoles (158-3037 microM), with the exception of itraconazole (8.4 microM). All of the imidazoles studied inhibited their own metabolism at high substrate concentrations. In terms of UGT1A4 metabolism, itraconazole showed kinetic features characteristic of imidazole rather than triazole antifungals. This behavior is attributed to the physicochemical properties of itraconazole that are similar to those of imidazoles in terms of clogP.", 
    "211": "Homer1a and Yotiao are two post-synaptic density proteins at the crossroad of dopamine-glutamate neurotransmission. Homer1a has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and is differentially induced by typical and atypical antipsychotics, perhaps according to their dopaminergic profile. Yotiao has been involved in glutamate and dopamine post-synaptic signalling. Here, we seek to determine whether Homer1a and Yotiao might be implicated in post-synaptic response to antipsychotics with affinity to different dopamine D(2) receptors: haloperidol (0.8mg kg(-1)), risperidone (3mg kg(-1)), olanzapine (2.5mg kg(-1)) and (-)-sulpiride (50mg kg(-1)). Homer1a expression was significantly induced by haloperidol compared to vehicle and to atypical antipsychotics in almost all striatal sub-regions. Atypical antipsychotics induced the gene in the lateral putamen and in the core of the accumbens only. All antipsychotics, with the exclusion of sulpiride, elicited a dorsolateral-to-ventromedial distribution pattern of Homer1a expression. No significant induction was detected for Yotiao. These results suggest that the quantitative and topographical pattern of Homer1a expression may putatively be related to antipsychotics affinity and/or occupancy at dopamine D(2) receptors.",

At 34 degrees C, in CCI DGCs, sIPSC frequency and amplitude were unchanged, whereas mIPSC frequency was decreased (3.10+/-0.84Hz, n=16, and 2.44+/-0.67Hz, n=7, p<0.05). At 23 degrees C, 300nM diazepam increased peak amplitude of mIPSCs in control and CCI DGCs, but the increase was 20% higher in control (26.81+/-2.2pA and 42.60+/-1.22pA, n=9, p=0.031) compared to CCI DGCs (33.46+/-2.98pA and 46.13+/-1.09pA, n=10, p=0.047). At 34 degrees C, diazepam did not prolong decay time constants (6.59+/-0.12ms and 6.62+/-0.98ms, n=9, p=0.12), the latter suggesting that CCI resulted in benzodiazepine-insensitive pharmacology in synaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). In CCI DGCs, peak amplitude of mIPSCs was inhibited by 100microM furosemide (51.30+/-0.80pA at baseline and 43.50+/-5.30pA after furosemide, n=5, p<0.001), a noncompetitive antagonist of GABA(A)Rs with an enhanced affinity to alpha4 subunit-containing receptors. Potentiation of tonic current by the GABA(A)R delta subunit-preferring competitive agonist THIP (1 and 3microM) was increased in CCI DGCs (47% and 198%) compared to control DGCs (13% and 162%), suggesting the presence of larger tonic current in CCI DGCs; THIP (1microM) had no effect on mIPSCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate alterations in synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs in DGCs following CCI.", 
    "213": "Benzodiazepine site agonists or inverse agonists enhance or reduce gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated inhibition of neurons, respectively. Recently, it was demonstrated that the point mutation gamma 2F77I causes a drastic change in the affinity of a variety of benzodiazepine agonists or inverse agonists in receptor binding studies. Here we investigated the potency and efficacy of 10 benzodiazepine site ligands from 6 structural classes in wild-type and gamma 2F77I point mutated recombinant GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 3 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2, and alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2 subunits. Results indicate that the effects of the benzodiazepine site ligands zolpidem, zopiclone, Cl218872, L-655,708 and DMCM were nearly completely eliminated in all mutated receptors up to a 1 microM concentration. The effects of bretazenil, Ro15-1788 or abecarnil were eliminated in some, but not all mutated receptors, suggesting that the gamma 2F77I mutation differentially influences the actions of these ligands in different receptor subtypes. In addition, this point mutation also influences the efficacy of diazepam for enhancing GABA-induced chloride flux, suggesting that the amino acid residue gamma 2F77 might also be involved in the transduction of the effect of benzodiazepines from binding to gating. The application of these drugs in a novel mouse model is discussed.", 
    "214": "The first step in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to identify, and if possible to treat any condition which might cause or worsen RLS, such as iron deficiency or some drug treatments. The patients suffering from RLS should be prompted to keep a healthy sleep schedule. Drug treatment should be restricted to patients with a clear clinical diagnosis, decided on an individual basis, when the clinical impact is serious. Four drug classes are central to the treatment of RLS: dopaminergic agents, some antiepileptics, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Dopaminergic agonists are the treatment of choice, especially when daily treatment is indicated, or if the symptoms are severe. Two dopaminergic agonists are licensed in France for the treatment of RLS: ropinirole (Adartrel) and pramipexole (Sifrol). After initiation of treatment, the patients should benefit from a regular follow-up in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to identify possible side-effects. Special care should be given to the detection of augmentation, a phenomenon characterized by a paradoxical worsening of the symptoms with treatment. Some particular conditions, such as RLS comorbid with renal insufficiency, during pregnancy, and in the child are discussed."
