    "13": "Essential tremor is a common movement disorder that affects between 5 and 10 million persons in the United States. It is characterized primarily by an action and postural tremor most often affecting the arms, but it can also affect other body parts. Essential tremor is a progressive neurologic disorder and can cause substantial disability in some patients. Although there is no cure for essential tremor, pharmacologic and surgical treatments can provide some benefit. Primidone and propranolol are first-line treatments. Other medications with potential efficacy include benzodiazepines, gabapentin, topiramate, and botulinum toxin. Patients with medication-resistant tremor may benefit from thalamotomy or deep brain stimulation of the thalamus. The use of medical and surgical therapies can provide benefit in up to 80% of patients with essential tremor.", 
    "14": "A fetal heart-rate pattern that has a reduced oscillation amplitude may indicate a physiological fetal dormant period but could also be an indication of fetal hypoxemia. In some rare cases such a fetal heart rate-pattern can be an indicator of cerebral or cardial fetal malformation or of an intoxication caused by sedative drugs. Our patient is a 32-year-old Para III in the phase of 29 weeks and 3 days gestation. Upon admission to the clinic, the fetal heart-rate pattern showed a reduced oscillation amplitude, and there were no signs of fetal movement. The ultrasound examination gave us no reason to suspect fetal malformation, and the results of the Doppler ultrasonography were also normal. However, although the patient had denied taking any medication at all, the results of an toxicological blood test confirmed our suspicion of benzodiazepine intoxication. Throughout the night the fetal heart-rate pattern was continuously measured, and in the early hours of the morning, after breaking down of the oxazepam medication, a normalization of the fetal heart-rate pattern was observed. This case report definitively demonstrates that Doppler ultrasonography is a valuable method for assessing any uncertainty regarding a fetal heart-rate pattern.",

The objective of this study was to assess in healthy volunteers (N = 14) the influence of a garlic extract on the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A4. Probe substrates dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) and alprazolam (CYP3A4) were administered orally at baseline and again after treatment with garlic extract (3 x 600 mg twice daily) for 14 days. Urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratios and alprazolam plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC at baseline and after garlic extract treatment. The ratio of dextromethorphan to its metabolite was 0.044 +/- 0.48 at baseline and 0.052 +/- 0.095 after garlic supplementation. There were no significant differences between the baseline and garlic phases (P > or =.05). For alprazolam, there were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters at baseline and after garlic extract treatment (all P values > or =.05; maximum concentration in plasma, 27.3 +/- 2.6 ng/mL versus 27.3 +/- 4.8 ng/mL; time to reach maximum concentration in plasma, 1.9 +/- 1.4 h versus 2.4 +/- 1.8 h; area under the time-versus-concentration curve, 537 +/- 94 h. ng. mL(-1) versus 548 +/- 159 h. ng. mL(-1); half-life of elimination, 13.7 +/- 4.4 h versus 14.5 +/- 4.3 h).

Because aprepitant may be used with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and ancillary support drugs, which may be substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, assessment of the potential of this drug to inhibit CYP3A4 activity in vivo is important. The effect of aprepitant on in vivo CYP3A4 activity in humans with oral midazolam used as a sensitive probe of CYP3A4 activity was evaluated in this study.", 
    "17": "In this open-label, randomized, single-period study, 16 healthy male subjects were enrolled.

The 125/80-mg regimen of aprepitant also increased the midazolam maximum observed concentration by 1.5-fold on day 1 (P <.05) and by 1.9-fold on day 5 (P <.01). The midazolam half-life values increased from 1.7 hours (prestudy) to 3.3 hours on both day 1 and day 5.

The time course of recovery from CYP3A inhibition after a single exposure to grapefruit juice is not clearly established.", 
    "21": "Healthy volunteer subjects (N = 25) received a single 6-mg oral dose of the CYP3A substrate midazolam in the control condition without exposure to grapefruit juice. Two days later, midazolam was administered 2 hours after 300 mL of regular-strength grapefruit juice. Subjects were then randomly assigned to 3 different groups, receiving a third midazolam challenge at 26, 50, or 74 hours after exposure to grapefruit juice. The capacity of 6'7'-dihydroxybergamottin and bergamottin to inhibit human CYP3A was studied in vitro using human liver microsomes.", 
    "22": "The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) for midazolam increased by a factor of 1.65 (ratio compared with control) when midazolam was given 2 hours after grapefruit juice. At 26, 50, and 74 hours after grapefruit juice, the AUC ratios (mean AUC value at the indicated time divided by the mean control AUC on day 1) were 1.29, 1.29, and 1.06, respectively. The relationship of time after grapefruit juice exposure versus AUC increase over control indicated a recovery half-life estimated at 23 hours. The midazolam elimination half-life did not change significantly from the control value at any time after grapefruit juice exposure. 6'7'-Dihydroxybergamottin inhibited midazolam alpha-hydroxylation in vitro, with a mean 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.7 micro mol/L; preincubation of microsomes with 6'7'-dihydroxybergamottin greatly reduced the 50% inhibitory concentration to 0.31 micro mol/L, consistent with mechanism-based inhibition. Bergamottin itself had much weaker inhibitory potency compared to 6'7'-dihydroxybergamottin.", 
    "23": "A usual single exposure to grapefruit juice appears to impair the enteric, but not the hepatic, component of presystemic extraction of oral midazolam. Recovery is largely complete within 3 days, consistent with enzyme regeneration after mechanism-based inhibition. 6'7'-Dihydroxybergamottin was verified as a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of midazolam alpha-hydroxylation by CYP3A in vitro.", 
    "24": "Mice lacking a synaptic isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) do not exhibit ocular dominance plasticity unless an appropriate level of GABAergic transmission is restored by direct infusion of benzodiazepines into the brain. To better understand how intracortical inhibition triggers experience-dependent changes, we dissected the precise timing requirement for GABA function in the monocular deprivation (MD) paradigm. Diazepam (DZ) or vehicle solution was infused daily before and/or during 4 d of MD in GAD65 knock-out mice. Extracellular single-unit recordings from the binocular zone of visual cortex were performed at the end of deprivation. We found that a minimum treatment of 2 d near the beginning of MD was sufficient to fully activate plasticity but did not need to overlap the deprivation per se. Extended delay after DZ infusion eventually led to loss of plasticity accompanied by improved intrinsic inhibitory circuit function. Two day DZ treatment just after eye opening similarly closed the critical period prematurely in wild-type mice. Raising wild-type mice in complete darkness from birth delayed the peak sensitivity to MD as in other mammals. Interestingly, 2 d DZ infusion in the dark also closed the critical period, whereas equally brief light exposure during dark-rearing had no such effect. Thus, enhanced tonic signaling through GABA(A) receptors rapidly creates a milieu for plasticity within neocortex capable of triggering a critical period for ocular dominance independent of visual experience itself.", 
    "25": "The objective of this study was to determine if the orally disintegrating tablet formulation of olanzapine, Zyprexa Zydis, would facilitate antipsychotic medication compliance in acutely ill, non-compliant patients. Eighty-five acutely ill patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who met medication non-compliance criteria received open-label olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets (1020 mgd) for up to 6 wk. Improvement in medication compliance was assessed using various rating scales to measure changes in psychopathology, medication-taking and compliance attitudes, and nursing care burden. Safety variables were also measured. Significant improvement from baseline was demonstrated in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at Week 1 and subsequently (p0.001). Significant improvement from baseline was also seen in various scales measuring medication compliance, attitude, and nursing care burden (p0.05). Olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets were well-tolerated. Olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets may benefit acutely ill, non-compliant schizophrenic patients by facilitating acceptance of active antipsychotic drug therapy.", 
    "26": "In order to assess the significance of drug levels measured in clinical and forensic toxicology as well as for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) it is essential that good collections of data are readily available. For more than 800 substances, therapeutic ('normal') and, if data was available, toxic, and fatal plasma concentrations as well as elimination half-lives were compiled in a table. The compilation includes data for hypnotics, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, sedatives, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., NSAIDs), antihistamines, antiepileptics, betaadrenergic antagonists, antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors), diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, antiarrhythmics, antiasthmatics, ACE-inhibitors, opiate agonists, and local anesthetics, among others. In addition, toxicologically relevant xenobiotics were listed. Data have been abstracted from published information, both compilations and primary sources and have been completed with data collected in our own forensic and clinical toxicology laboratories. Wherever possible, ranges for therapeutic plasma concentrations are expressed as trough concentration at steady state. The half-life values given for each drug are chosen to represent the terminal log-linear phase at most. It is the purpose to rapidly assess the significance of drug levels for the therapeutic monitoring of patients, and to facilitate the diagnostic and clinical assessment in case of intoxications.", 
    "27": "A meta-analysis was done of the published literature concerning the modern status of the issue of sleep disturbances and of findings from the author's investigations. Data are submitted obtained in a clinical examination of 61 elderly patient in a therapeutical hospital. In the above patients, high prevalence has been revealed of different sleep disturbances. Insomnia is often a sequela of psychophysiological derangements, which fact necessitates an exhaustive differential diagnosis and choice of remedies to be used in therapy of the above disorders. An experience is described of employment of zopiclon (Somnol Grindex) to deal with sleep problems in those patients in the involutional period. It is suggested that psychiatrist services be more actively used to give the necessary advice to those patients of the cardiological profile presenting with sleep disturbances.", 
    "28": "Specific ligands of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) are known to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in oesophageal cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we investigated the transcriptional alterations and activation of protein kinases in response to PBR-specific ligands. Using cDNA arrays, we examined the transcriptional effects of the PBR-specific ligand FGIN-1-27 in two oesophageal cancer cell lines, KYSE-140 (squamous cell carcinoma) and OE-33 (adenocarcinoma). In oesophageal cancer cells, FGIN-1-27 induced extensive changes in the expression of genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle. Both in oesophageal cancer cell lines (KYSE-140, OE-33) we observed a strong upregulation of the growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible genes, gadd45 and gadd153, in response to PBR ligands. gadd genes are known to be induced by p38MAPK activation. Using Western blotting we detected a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of p38MAPK, which was found to be functionally involved in gadd induction, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, our data indicate that PBR-specific ligands cause apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by activation of the p38MAPK pathway and induction of gadd45 and gadd153.", 
    "29": "Separate investigations have suggested that olanzapine, a D4 antagonist, decreases craving after a priming dose of alcohol and that the DRD4 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism influences the expression of craving after a priming dose of alcohol. The present study tested the hypothesis that olanzapine may be differentially effective at reducing cue-elicited craving based on individual differences in DRD4 VNTR in a sample of heavy social drinkers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (5 mg) or a control medication (cyproheptadine, 4 mg) prior to consuming three alcoholic drinks. Participants completed subjective measures of craving and euphoria after each drink. Participants who were homozygous or heterozygous for the 7 (or longer) repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR were classified as DRD4 L, while the other participants were classified as DRD4 S. The findings indicated that olanzapine reduces craving for alcohol at baseline for both DRD4 S and DRD4 L individuals, but only reduces craving after exposure to alcohol cues and after a priming dose of alcohol for DRD4 L individuals.", 
    "30": "Maternal care influences the development of stress reactivity in the offspring. These effects are accompanied by changes in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) expression in brain regions that regulate responses to stress. However, such effects appear secondary to those involving systems that normally serve to inhibit CRF expression and release. Thus, maternal care over the first week of life alters GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid)(A) receptor mRNA subunit expression. The adult offspring of mothers that exhibit increased levels of pup licking/grooming and arched back-nursing (high LG-ABN mothers) show increased alpha1 mRNA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus as well as the basolateral and central regions, of the amygdala and increased gamma2 mRNA in the amygdala. Western blot analyses confirm these effects at the level of protein. In contrast, the offspring of low LG-ABN mothers showed increased levels of alpha3 and alpha4 subunit mRNAs. The results of an adoption study showed that the biological offspring of low LG-ABN mothers fostered shortly after birth to high LG-ABN dams showed the increased levels of both alpha1 and gamma2 mRNA expression in the amygdala in comparison to peers fostered to other low LG-ABN mothers (the reverse was true for the biological offspring of high LG-ABN mothers). These findings are consistent with earlier reports of the effects of maternal care on GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor binding and suggest that maternal care can permanently alter the subunit composition of the GABA(A) receptor complex in brain regions that regulate responses to stress.", 
    "31": "We previously demonstrated that soybean beta-conglycinin peptone suppresses food intake and gastric emptying by direct action on rat small intestinal mucosal cells to stimulate cholecystokinin (CCK) release. The aim of the present study was to define the active fragment in beta-conglycinin by using synthetic peptides chosen from the sequence of three beta-conglycinin subunits. We selected the fragments that had multiple nonadjacent arginine residues, and investigated their ability to bind to components of the rat intestinal brush border membrane as well as to stimulate CCK release and appetite suppression. The fragment from 51 to 63 of the beta subunit (beta 51-63) had the strongest binding activity. Intraduodenal infusion of beta 51-63 inhibited food intake and markedly increased portal CCK concentration. The threshold concentration of beta 51-63 to affect food intake was 3 micro mol/L. The CCK-A receptor antagonist abolished the beta 51-63-induced suppression of food intake. Three types of smaller fragments of beta 51-63 (beta 51-59, beta 53-63 and beta 53-59) and two types of fragments similar to beta 51-63 in the beta-conglycinin alpha and alpha' subunits (alpha 212-224 and alpha' 230-240) had less binding ability than did beta 51-63. Model peptides constructed with arginine (R) and glycine (G), such as GRGRGRG, had strong binding affinity, but peptides containing a single R or RR did not. These results indicate that the beta-conglycinin beta 51-63 fragment is the bioactive appetite suppressant in beta-conglycinin, and multiple arginine residues in the fragment may be involved in this effect.",

Short-term hormonal or steroid treatment of WS with good efficacy is reported in the literature. The aim of this retrospective multiinstitutional study was to evaluate the early discontinuation of nonhormonal and nonsteroid treatment for WS.", 
    "37": "Twenty-two WS cases in which treatment was discontinued after a maximum of 6 months, were collected. Inclusion criteria were the presence of typical EEG hypsarrhythmia (HY) and video-EEG recorded epileptic spasms. Exclusion criteria were the presence of partial seizures or other seizure types before spasm onset. The patients were treated with vigabatrin (VGB) in 19 cases and nitrazepam (NTZ) in three. The dose range was 70-130 mg/kg/day for VGB and 0.7-1.5 mg/kg/day for NTZ. The drug was discontinued if spasms stopped and HY disappeared after a mean treatment period of 5.1 months (range, 3-6 months). All patients underwent repeated and prolonged awake and sleep video-EEG, both before and after drug discontinuation.",

    "40": "Electrophysiological studies have revealed an increase in the level of tonic inhibition in the hippocampus following prenatal protein malnutrition in rats. In the present study, whole cell patch clamp recordings of bipolar interneurons in the stratum radiatum of the CA3 subfield were used to determine whether this increase in inhibition can be accounted for by a change in the electrophysiological properties of GABAergic interneurons. Hippocampal slices were prepared from juvenile rats whose dams were fed either a normal (25% casein) or low (6% casein) protein diet throughout pregnancy. Intrinsic membrane and action potential properties were unaltered by the prenatal nutritional insult. In most respects the characteristics of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and the modulation of such currents by the benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem were also similar in cells from the two nutritional groups. While the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory currents was unaltered, miniature (Tetrodotoxin resistant) inhibitory currents occurred at a significantly increased frequency in interneurons from prenatally protein malnourished rats. Thus, while the basic membrane properties of interneurons are preserved, there is a significant increase in the probability of GABA release from interneurons following prenatal protein malnutrition.", 
    "41": "The atypical antipsychotics risperidone, clozapine and olanzapine were studied for their ability to antagonise apomorphine-induced stereotypy and to affect electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in rats. The compounds antagonised apomorphine-induced stereotypy with ED(50)s of 0.15 mg/kg s.c. for risperidone, 0.42 mg/kg s.c. for olanzapine and 1.3 mg/kg s.c. for clozapine. At a dose close to that required for apomorphine antagonism (0.16 mg/kg s.c.), risperidone induced only minor changes in EEG power spectral activity. At a higher dosage (0.63 mg/kg s.c.) it increased the power density in the high frequency range (9.8-18.6 Hz), characteristic of a sedative-like effect. Olanzapine and clozapine caused a dose-dependent increase in power density in all frequency bands. These effects were already present at doses (0.04 and 0.16 mg/kg s.c., respectively) 10 times below those required for apomorphine antagonism. The effects increased dose-dependently and were pronounced at the doses required for apomorphine antagonism. These results in rats are in agreement with the clinical observation that risperidone has less propensity for inducing sedation at therapeutic dose levels than olanzapine and clozapine.", 
    "42": "The relative efficacies and cardiorespiratory effects of three injectable anesthetic combinations containing medetomidine were evaluated in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). In addition, the direct effects of medetomidine on heart rate and blood pressure were evaluated in lemurs anesthetized with isoflurane. For injectable anesthesia, captive adult ring-tailed lemurs were anesthetized with medetomidine and ketamine (0.04-0.06 mg/kg, i.m. and 3 mg/kg, i.m., respectively), medetomidine, butorphanol, and ketamine (0.04 mg/kg, i.m., 0.4 mg/kg, i.m., and 3 mg/kg, i.m., respectively), or medetomidine, butorphanol, and midazolam (0.04 mg/kg, i.m., 0.4 mg/kg, i.m., and 0.3 mg/kg, i.m., respectively). For inhalation anesthesia, lemurs were mask-induced and maintained with isoflurane for 30 min before receiving medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg, i.m.). Sedation produced by medetomidine-ketamine was unpredictable and of short duration. Both medetomidine-butorphanol-ketamine (MBK) and medetomidine-butorphanol-midazolam (MBMz) provided adequate anesthesia for routine physical exams; however, the effects of MBMz lasted longer than those of MBK. Heart rates and respiratory rates were within clinically normal ranges for all groups, and lemurs remained normotensive throughout the study. Common side effects such as hypertension and bradycardia associated with the use of alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist combinations in other species were not observed. Likewise, medetomidine administration had no effect on HR in lemurs receiving isoflurane. Lemurs in all groups were well ventilated and remained well oxygenated throughout the procedures, though arterial partial pressure of O2 was lowest in the MBMz group. All three injectable medetomidine combinations were effective in ring-tailed lemurs but only MBK and MBMz provided adequate depth and duration of anesthesia for use as sole regimes. For many clinical procedures in lemurs, MBMz offers advantages over MBK because of its longer duration of action and its rapid and more complete reversibility with specific antagonists.",

The patient received a 30% total body surface area burn involving his face and upper torso that resulted in an inhalation injury. Several attempts at weaning from mechanical ventilation failed due to his extreme agitation, which was unresponsive to benzodiazepines, opiates, and antipsychotic agents. Propofol therapy was begun in combination with valproic acid, fluoxetine, and risperidone to assist in the treatment of his severe agitation associated with the bipolar disease, inhibiting ventilatory weaning. Repeated attempts to discontinue propofol were associated with withdrawal symptoms such as severe agitation, tremors, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperpyrexia. His symptoms resolved only after each time the propofol infusion was restarted.

    "51": "Potential weight gain must be taken into account in the patient's comprehensive treatment approach when initiating antipsychotic treatment with Olanzapine. There are effective preventive and therapeutic pharmacological interventions to control this adverse effect. Not addressing this eventual treatment aspect of Olanzapine treatment may compromise the patient's health and his/her compliance with the pharmacological treatment indicated in serious psychiatric conditions. The decision to use a molecule must be made taking into account its efficacy, efficiency and adverse effect profile. In this study, concomitant administration of Ranitidine prevented or corrected weight gain in 59.6% of cases. Patients followed by 16 weeks had shown the following results: Olanzapine without Ranitidine, exhibited an average weight gain of 3.4 kilograms, ranging between -2.5 and +16 kg. This implies an average increase of 1.19 in BMI for this group. Patients treated additionally with Ranitidine at doses of 300 mg, a 0.9 kilogram weight gain ranging between -4 and +10.6 kg was observed, implying an average BMI change of 0.34. In patients treated with Ranitidine at doses of 600 mg, the weight gain curve trended toward normalization with a 1.6 kilogram decrease, ranging between -15 and +7 kilograms, accounting for a decrease of 0.6 points in BMI. While more extensive studies are required, our interest with this study is to demonstrate that we can count on a potentially simple and useful response for the treatment of weight gain associated with Olanzapine use. The risk/benefit ratio is a paradigm in the practice of medicine. In the case of Olanzapine, the scale clearly tips in favor of the latter, making it the drug of choice in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",

Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 10) received midazolam extracorporeally (into the circuit), and group 2 received drug via central or peripheral access. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations were taken at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h, then every 12 h. Population pharmacokinetic analysis and model building was conducted using WinNonMix (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA).

    "54": "The parameter estimates (n = 19) were based on a one-compartment model with time-dependent change in volume of distribution. Volume (mean +/- standard error) expanded monoexponentially from the onset of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to a maximum value, 0.8 l +/- 0.5 and 4.1 +/- 0.5 l/kg, respectively. Consequently, plasma half-life was substantially prolonged (median [range]) from onset to steady-state: 6.8 (2.2-39.8) and 33.3 (7.4-178) h, respectively. Total body clearance was determined as (mean +/- standard error) 1.4 +/- 0.15 ml. kg-1. min-1. The median metabolic ratio was 0.17 (0.03-0.9).

    "57": "Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively from neurologically intact children (0.2-17.7 years of age) who underwent ambulatory diagnostic EGD during a 4-year period. Data were included from 155 consecutive patients receiving propofol with or without premedication with midazolam (PM group). One hundred five consecutive patients who received sedation with a midazolam plus meperidine combination served as a comparison (MM group). Outcome variables were: time required for induction of sedation, length of procedure, time for recovery, need for additional supportive measures, and need for physical restraint.", 
    "58": "The onset of sedation was faster and the length of procedure and recovery were significantly shorter in the PM group as compared with the MM group (P < 0.01). Patients in the MM group required restraint more often than in the PM group. A higher dose of meperidine and midazolam was used in the prospective study. This led to deeper sedation but increased need for additional support.",

    "60": "The effects of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the plasma kinetics of quazepam and its two active metabolites after a single oral dose of the drug were studied. Ten healthy male volunteers received itraconazole 100 mg/d or placebo for 14 days in a double-blind randomized crossover manner, and on the fourth day of the treatment they received a single oral 20-mg dose of quazepam. Blood samplings and evaluation of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Stanford Sleepiness Scale were conducted up to 240 h after quazepam dosing. Itraconazole treatment did not change the plasma kinetics of quazepam but significantly decreased the peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam. Itraconazole treatment did not affect either of the psychomotor function parameters. The present study thus suggests that CYP 3A4 is partly involved in the metabolism of quazepam.", 
    "61": "Although genetic background is acknowledged as a potentially important determinant of mutant phenotypes, publications on genetically modified mice far outnumber those on progenitor strains. We have recently reported major differences in basal anxiety levels (elevated plus-maze & light/dark exploration) among three strains (C57BL/6JOlaHsd, 129/SvEv and 129S2/SvHsd) employed as progenitor stock in European laboratories (Rodgers et al. in press). Furthermore, the phenotypes of these inbred strains differed significantly from that of an outbred strain (Swiss-Webster) commonly used in behavioural pharmacology. In view of these findings, the present study assessed possible differences in the anxiolytic efficacy of chlordiazepoxide (0, 7.5 & 15.0 mg/kg, IP) in three of these strains (Swiss-Webster (SW), C57BL/6JOIaHsd (C57) & 129S2/SvHsd (129)). Experimentally naive mice were exposed to the elevated plus-maze, sessions were videotaped and behaviour analysed using ethological software. The performance of control subjects confirmed significant strain differences in basal levels of activity (SW > C57 > 129) and anxiety-related behaviours (129 = SW > C57), with hypolocomotion dominating the 129 profile. SW mice displayed an anxioselective response to both doses of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), with significant reductions in open arm avoidance and risk assessment observed in the absence of any change in general activity. In direct contrast, the lower dose of CDP (7.5 mg/kg) was without effect in either inbred strain, whereas treatment with 15.0 mg/kg induced a profile indicative of muscle relaxation/mild sedation in C57 mice and virtually abolished all behavioural activity in 129 mice. Although the absence of an anxiolytic response to CDP in C57 mice may be attributed to their low basal anxiety levels, the profile of 129 mice strongly suggests an abnormality in benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor function. The implications of these findings for research on mutant mice are discussed.", 
    "62": "One of the approaches to the development of new medicines now is the exploration of the effects of low and ultra low doses (ULD) of biologically active substances and preparations traditionally used in rather high dosages. The purpose of our work was to investigate the influence of pharmacologically active substances of various classes at wide range of concentrations, including ultra low, on lipid peroxidation in cell membranes of mice brain and activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The action of synthetic antioxidant (AO) from the group of hindered phenols (inhibitors of free-radical reactions) phenozan, neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), hybrid compound \"phenozan + ACh + alkyl radical C-10\" (perspective for Alzheimer's disease therapy), tranquilizer from benzodiazepines phenazepam and hydrogen peroxide were investigated. The influence of the investigated substances at ULD (concentrations) on kinetic parameters of the reaction, catalysed with soluble and membrane AChE (Michaelis constant and maximal velocity), and also on lipid peroxidation (LPO) system (level of products and LPO velocity, contents of total lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol) in mice brain cell membranes in vitro and in vivo was revealed. Concentrational and dose curves were of compilated character with the presence of zero effect zones typical for the agents capable to work at ULD. The effects of super low and \"usual\" doses of investigated substances were commensurable.",

S-100 is regulator of brain integrative activity and takes part in synaptic processes. In experiment on outbred rats proproten demonstrates significant anxiolytic, antidepressant and antiamnestic effects after single and repeated administration. Proproten is similar to the well-known reference preparations diazepam, amitriptyline and piracetam in activity. Proporten's advantage over these drugs is no sedative, myorelaxation and amnestic effects. Psychotropic effects of proproten are likely to result from modulation of synaptic transmission in limbic structures of brain.", 
    "64": "Effects of benzodiazepine tranquillizers (phenazepam, flunitrazepam), antidepressants (amitriptiline, imipramine) and nootropic piracetam injected in supersmall dozes were studied in outbred albino rats. It was found that in supersmall doses (10(-12)-10(-14) mol/kg) all these substances exert characteristic for each of these classes specific effects revealed by means of adequate pharmacological techniques. Benzodiazepine tranquillizers increased the number of punished water lickings in the conflict situation test. Antidepressants increased the number of wheel rotations in the test of the forced swimming in a tank with freely rotating wheels and enhanced a correlation between the number of wheel turns during the first and the second five minutes of the experiment. Nootrop piracetam increased the rate of acquisition of the active avoidance reflex in a shuttle box. The effects of all investigated drugs injected in supersmall doses were not accompanied by side effects, characteristic for them at administration in usual dosages. The conclusion is made, that the action of the drugs injected in supersmall doses is an universal property of psychotropic drugs. When administered in supersmall doses the pharmacological substances still exert their specific activity, but are devoid of side effects.", 
    "65": "At present, there are no simple and reliable methods for selection of compounds with physiological activity in super-low concentrations (SLC). The screening system with high predictability is proposed. At the beginning, experiment is carried out on infusorians--spirostoma. Their motion activity, behavior, living ability and shape are registered at concentrations of substances in a range of 10(-3)-10(-13) mol/l. If the effect is detected on spirostoma, then experiments are performed on laboratory animals or their isolated tissues. Specific deviations on injection substance in SLC are detected, depending on compounds class. Nine representatives of different classes of biologically active compounds are investigated in the work: carbofos, deltametrin, 3-quinuclidinyl benzylate, atropine, phenosan, fenazepam, dopamine receptor antagonist SCH-23390, ciprine, and hexenal. It is accepted that if compound action in SLC is observed on spirostoma, then effects in super-low doses are also detected in a whole animal.",

Mean cerebral blood flow values within the ischemic core were significantly lower and the volume of the ischemic penumbra was smaller in the malignant than in the benign group. In patients with malignant course, cerebral perfusion pressure dropped to <50 to 60 mm Hg 22 to 72 hours (mean, 52.0 hours) after onset of symptoms; subsequently, Pto2 dropped and glutamate increased, indicating secondary ischemia. Maximal changes in the monitored variables reached significant levels for glutamate, aspartate, GABA, glycerol, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, hypoxanthine, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and Pto2.",

These signals change with local cerebral blood flow coupled to neural activity. However, the relationship between BOLD signals and neural function is poorly understood and requires the development of animal models. Here we use an unanesthetized rat preparation to study BOLD responses to whisker stimulation in somatic sensory barrel cortex. Five rats were trained to tolerate restraint in a holder and fMRI noise with positive reinforcement. For maximal immobilization, the head was fastened to the holder with nuts screwed on threaded bolts attached to the head. On scanning day, residual stress was alleviated with injections of diazepam, and the rats were restrained in the holder and transferred into the scanner. After >75 min to allow the tranquilization to abate, structural images were acquired from three coronal brain slices. Subsequently, functional images were taken utilizing 4-min epochs without stimulation alternated with equivalent epochs during which the right caudal whiskers were stimulated with three air puffs/s. After 4 weeks, fMRI could be repeated in four rats. In seven of the nine functional runs, head motion was minimal and whisker stimulation resulted in a statistically significant (P </= 0.05) increase in BOLD signal in barrel cortex predominantly on the contralateral side. The results provide encouragement that long-term fMRI studies on cerebral function in unanesthetized rats may be feasible with our procedure.",

The drugs affecting CYP3A4 activity inhibit or induce the metabolism of the benzodiazepines metabolised by this enzyme, and induce side effects or reduce therapeutic effects of these drugs. Therefore, the combination of the two groups of drugs should be avoided, and if it is unavoidable the dose of benzodiazepines should be adjusted.", 
    "117": "We investigated the efficacy and safety of midazolam given intravenously for the treatment of status epilepticus in children. Patients received one to three bolus injections of midazolam (0.15 to 0.40 mg/kg) until seizures disappeared completely. In other patients, continuous infusion of midazolam (0.06 to 0.48 mg/kg/hr) followed a bolus of midazolam or other anti-epileptic agents. The dose was increased every 15 minutes until the seizures were brought under control. The etiology of 62 episodes of status epilepticus was epilepsy in 43, acute encephalopathy/encephalitis in 11, febrile seizures in 7 and hypoxic encephalopathy in 1. The age of the patients ranged from 0.2 to 18.4 years (average: 3.7 years). Bolus injections were administered in 53 episodes. The average loading dose was 0.35 +/- 0.22 mg/kg (range 0.15 to 0.90 mg/kg). Of the 42 episodes in which seizures disappeared, 13 required no further continuous infusions. Of the remaining 29 in which continuous infusion was done at the rate of 0.06 to 0.60 mg/kg/hr (mean 0.30 mg/kg/hr), 21 ended in cessation of the seizures. The duration of continuous infusions ranged from 4 to 288 hours (average 49.0 hours). In 6 episodes there were adverse effects:transient hypoxemia (5) and agitation during withdrawal (1). No intervention was needed except oxygenation by mask for less than 72 hours. Midazolam is effective and safe, and can be used as the first line drug in the treatment of status epilepticus in children.",

    "119": "Patients with vascular disease were randomized to lotrafiban 30 or 50 mg BID on the basis of age and predicted creatinine clearance or placebo in addition to aspirin at a dose ranging from 75 to 325 mg/d at the discretion of the physician-investigator. Follow-up was for up to 2 years. The primary end point was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia requiring hospitalization, and urgent revascularization. Of 9190 patients enrolled from 23 countries and 690 hospitals, 41% had cerebrovascular disease at the time of entry, and 59% had coronary artery disease. Death occurred in 2.3% of placebo-assigned patients and 3.0% of lotrafiban-group patients (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.72, P=0.026), and the cause of excess death was vascular related. There was no significant difference in the primary end point (17.5% compared with 16.4%, respectively; hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.03, P=0.19). Serious bleeding was more frequent in the lotrafiban group (8.0% compared with 2.8%; P<0.001). Serious bleeding was more common among patients who received higher doses of aspirin (>162 mg/d), with or without lotrafiban.",

    "121": "To elucidate the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor complex and excitatory amino acid receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] and non-NMDA receptors) in propofol-induced anesthesia, we examined behaviorally the effects of GABAergic and glutamatergic drugs on propofol anesthesia in mice. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally. General anesthetic potencies were evaluated using a righting reflex assay. The GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol potentiated propofol (140 mg/kg; 50% effective dose for loss of righting reflex) induced anesthesia. Similarly, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam and the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 augmented propofol anesthesia, but the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX did not. In contrast, the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline antagonized propofol (200 mg/kg; 95% effective dose for loss of righting reflex) induced anesthesia. However, neither the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, the GABA synthesis inhibitor L-allylglycine, nor the NMDA receptor agonist NMDA reversed propofol anesthesia. Conversely, the non-NMDA receptor agonist kainate enhanced propofol anesthesia. These results suggest that propofol-induced anesthesia is mediated, at least in part, by both GABA(A) and excitatory amino acid receptors.",

    "123": "The effects of intracerebroventricular and intraseptal (the medial septum) administration of a prototypical acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChE-I), physostigmine, and a classic benzodiazepine midazolam on rat behavior in the open field test of neophobia and in the conditioned fear test (freezing reaction) were examined in rats. In the open field test of neophobia midazolam and physostigmine increased at a limited dose range, rat exploratory activity, after intracerebroventricular injection. Physostigmine produced in addition the hyperlocomotory effect. Following intraseptal injections, only physostigmine selectively prolonged the time spent by animals in the central sector of the open field. In the model of a conditioned fear, both midazolam and physostigmine inhibited rat freezing reaction to the aversively conditioned context after intracerebroventricular, but not after intraseptal, pretrial drug administration. The presented data support the notion about the selective anxiolytic-like effects of some AChE-Is. It appears, therefore, that the calming and sedative effects of AChE-Is observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease may be directly related to their anxiolytic action, independent of an improvement in cognitive functions, which in turn may decrease disorientation-induced distress and anxiety.", 
    "124": "The importance of testosterone for impulsive-like behavior is unclear. Here we studied the effect of testosterone administration during 6 and 14 days (separate experiments) with one, three and five testosterone-filled silastic capsules implanted subcutaneously on shock-induced behavioral inhibition and on flunitrazepam-induced disinhibition in a modified Vogel's drinking conflict model in rats. Alleviation of shock-induced behavioral inhibition has been suggested to reflect impulsive-like behavior and/or anxiolysis. Treatment with the highest testosterone dose used for 6 (Experiment 1) and 14 (Experiment 3) days increased the number of shocks accepted. Testosterone treatment affected serum levels of testosterone and accessory sex organ weights. Flunitrazepam induced behavioral disinhibition in both testosterone-treated (for 14 days) and sham-treated rats. Moreover, testosterone treatment for 14 days resulted in enhanced GABA-induced 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes as compared to controls. In conclusion, testosterone produces behavioral disinhibition and may enhance brain GABAA receptor function.", 
    "125": "The anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg) on the cumulative burying behavior and the burying behavior latency were compared between intact and castrated male rats. In both groups a clear reduction in cumulative burying, denoting an anxiolytic-like response, was observed. However, castrated males were more sensitive to diazepam in the burying behavior latency, a parameter indicating reactivity. Thus, orchidectomized males showed an increase in burying behavior latency after 1.0 mg/kg diazepam treatment. This dose has no effect on burying behavior latency in intact animals. The higher sensitivity to diazepam on reactivity seems to be androgen dependent because it was reversed by chronic treatment with testosterone propionate (TP, 0.0625 mg/rat for 2 weeks). TP (0.0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/rat) produced a dose-dependent reduction in burying behavior after chronic treatment (four injections separated 48 h). At no dose did TP affect burying behavior latency. These results indicate that some actions of diazepam vary in males depending upon the endocrine milieu. Results also support the idea of androgens possessing anxiolytic-like actions.", 
    "126": "When barbiturates have been tested in animals trained to discriminate the intravenous benzodiazepine (Bz) anesthetic midazolam, squirrel monkeys and pigeons did not reliably generalize to barbiturates but rats did. To explore this unexpected phenomenon in another species and to extend the midazolam generalization profile to GABAergic compounds not previously tested, five baboons were trained to discriminate midazolam maleate (0.32 mg/kg i.v.) from saline under a two-lever procedure. In tests 10 min after dose delivery, the partial agonist imidazenil, the full agonist chlordiazepoxide, and the receptor-subtype-selective hypnotic zolpidem fully shared discriminative effects with midazolam. The barbiturate pentobarbital did so in only one of five baboons, and the intravenous anesthetic propofol failed to do so in the three baboons tested. Testing 1 min after dose delivery shifted midazolam and zolpidem curves to the left and increased generalization to propofol but not pentobarbital. Taken together with previous published data, partial or full agonism at the Bz binding site appears sufficient for midazolam-like discriminative effects in nonhuman primates, pigeons, and rodents, and modulation through the anesthetic site is sufficient in baboons. However, to date, positive modulation of GABA through the barbiturate site is not generally sufficient for this effect in nonhuman primates and pigeons although it is in rodents.", 
    "127": "The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that allopregnanolone infused into the lateral septal nuclei will reduce conflict-like behavior in ovariectomized rats. The interaction with systemic administration of several agonists and antagonists of the GABA-A receptor was assessed. Results showed that intralateral septal doses of allopregnanolone (1.0 microg, P<.05; 2.0 microg, P<.05) or systemic injections of allopregnanolone (1.0 mg/kg s.c., P<.05; 2.0 mg/kg s.c., P<.05), diazepam (2.0 mg/kg i.p., P<.05), or muscimol (0.3 mg/kg i.p., P<.05; 0.6 mg/kg i.p., P<.05) reduced conflict-like behavior. Subthreshold doses of intralateral septal infusions of allopregnanolone (0.5 microg/side) synergized with systemic subthreshold doses of GABA-A agonists: allopregnanolone (0.5 mg/kg, P<.05), diazepam (1.5 mg/kg, P<.05), or muscimol (0.1 mg/kg, P<.05). The GABA-A antagonists, flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) and bicuculline (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) attenuated the synergism between intralateral septal infusions of allopregnanolone and diazepam or muscimol, respectively. Conversely, neither flumazenil (P<.05) nor bicuculline (P<.05) attenuated the synergism of the combination allopregnanolone (intralateral septum nuclei; 0.5 microg/side) plus systemic injections of allopregnanolone. In conclusion, allopregnanolone reduced conflict-like behavior probably acting at the GABA-A receptors found in the lateral septal nuclei.", 
    "128": "We examined the effects of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and desipramine, a selective noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor, given alone or in combination with diazepam on immobility time in the tail suspension test in diabetic mice. Immobility time was significantly longer in diabetic than in nondiabetic mice. Diazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently decreased immobility time in diabetic mice to the level observed in saline-treated nondiabetic mice. However, diazepam had no significant effect on immobility time in nondiabetic mice. Fluoxetine (3-56 mg/kg i.p.) and desipramine (1-30 mg/kg i.p.) produced marked, dose-dependent suppression of immobility time in both nondiabetic and diabetic mice. However, anti-immobility effects of fluoxetine and desipramine in diabetic mice were less than those in nondiabetic mice. Fluvoxamine (3-30 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-dependent suppression of immobility time in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. The anti-immobility effects of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and desipramine in nondiabetic mice were antagonized by pretreatment with diazepam (0.3 mg/kg s.c.). Furthermore, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and desipramine had no effect on the immobility time in diazepam (0.3 mg/kg s.c.)-treated diabetic mice. These results indicate that the anti-immobility effects of SSRIs and desipramine are less in diabetic mice than in nondiabetic mice in the tail suspension test. Furthermore, in diabetic mice, SSRIs and selective NA reuptake inhibitors did not affect immobility time even though the prolonged duration of immobility was suppressed by pretreatment with diazepam.",

    "144": "Good-quality sleep is an important and frequently overlooked component of general health, but it is particularly essential to patients with epilepsy. Their sleep can be affected by seizures, concurrent sleep disorders and seizure treatment. Worsening sleep can result not only in poor daytime functioning but also potentially in worsening epilepsy. The effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on sleep are of particular concern. Some agents have detrimental effects on sleep, particularly benzodiazepines and barbiturates but also phenytoin and, possibly, carbamazepine. Others, especially gabapentin, seem to actually improve sleep quality. Much research in this area is confounded by the effects of seizures and concurrent conditions on sleep, making it difficult to isolate the direct effects of AEDs on sleep. But because AEDs have independent effects on sleep quality, the choice of an appropriate agent not only determines whether seizures are completely controlled but also whether the patient performs optimally on a daily basis.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not known. In this study, we have determined the influence of GABA(A) receptor subunit composition on the effects of etifoxine, using recombinant murine GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Basal chloride currents mediated by homomeric beta receptors were reduced by micromolar concentrations of etifoxine, showing that beta subunits possess a binding site for this modulator. In oocytes expressing alpha(1)beta(x) GABA(A) receptors (x=1, 2 or 3), etifoxine evoked a chloride current in the absence of GABA and enhanced GABA (EC10)-activated currents, in a dose-dependent manner. Potentiating effects were also observed with alpha(2)beta(x), beta(x)gamma(2s) or alpha(1)beta(x)gamma(2s) combinations. The extent of potentiation was clearly beta-subunit-dependent, being more pronounced at receptors containing a beta(2) or a beta(3) subunit than at receptors incorporating a beta(1) subunit. The mutation of Asn 289 in the channel domain of beta(2) to a serine (the homologous residue in beta(1)) did not significantly depress the effects of etifoxine at alpha(1)beta(2) receptors. This specific pattern of inhibition/potentiation was compared with that of other known modulators of GABA(A) receptor function like benzodiazepines, neurosteroids, barbiturates or loreclezole.", 
    "151": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a critical component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a multiprotein complex located at the contact site between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, which is intimately involved in the initiation and regulation of apoptosis. PBR is a small evolutionary conserved protein, located at the surface of the mitochondria where it is physically associated with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and adenosine nucleotide translocase (ANT) that form the backbone of MPTP. PBR is widely distributed throughout the body and has been associated with numerous biological functions. Consistent with its localization in the MPTP, PBR is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, but also in the regulation of cell proliferation, stimulation of steroidogenesis, immunomodulation, porphyrin transport, heme biosynthesis, anion transport and regulation of mitochondrial functions. The recent literature on PBR is reviewed here. Specifically, we highlight numerous results suggesting that the use of specific PBR ligands to modulate PBR activity may have potential therapeutic applications and might be of significant clinical benefit in the management of a large spectrum of different indications including cancer, auto-immune, infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we present the proposed mechanisms by which the molecules exerted these effects, particularly oriented on the modulation of the MPTP activities.", 
    "152": "Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) such as TIBO, HEPT and dipyridodiazepinone are effective against HIV-1 RT. These NNRTIs are chemically and structurally diverse, but they all bind to a common allosteric site of HIV-1 RT. These inhibitors exhibit high potency, low cytotoxicity and produce few side effects. However, the emergency of drug-resistance viral strain has limited the therapeutic efficiency of the NNRTIs. Several different QSAR studies were reported to identify important structural features responsible for the inhibitory activity of these NNRTIs. In this study, hologram quantitative structure-activity relationships (HQSAR) was applied to three different data sets, 70 TIBO, 101 HEPT and 125 dipyridodiazepinone derivatives. Starting geometries of compounds were taken from available X-ray crystallographic data. Modification and full geometry optimization of all derivatives were performed, based on quantum chemical calculations at the HF/3-21G level of theory. All derived HQSAR models produce satisfying predictive ability and yield r(2)(cv) values ranging from 0.62-0.84. Moreover, it was also found that the quality of models enhances as the size of fragments increases. The obtained HQSAR results indicate the similarity of the interactions of these three different NNRTIs with the inhibition pocket of the enzyme. Comparisons of different QSAR methods on these NNRTIs data sets were also considered and it could be shown that HQSAR results yield superior predictive models than other 2D-QSAR approaches. In particular, the predictive ability of the models derived from dipyridodiazepinone analogues was significantly improved and apparently revealed differentiating structural requirements between WT and Y181C HIV RT inhibition. Additionally, the quality of QSAR models constructed by CoMFA and HQSAR methods are comparable and the interpretations of the models reinforce each other. It suggests an advantage of HQSAR as a useful tool in designing new potent inhibitors with enhanced HIV-1 RT inhibition activity, especially against mutant enzyme.", 
    "153": "Currently the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is largely unrealised, with no preventive or curative therapies. The marketed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg. donepezil, Aricept) are directed toward temporary symptomatic relief from impaired cognition, but have prominent adverse effects with minimal efficacy. In pursuit of novel cognition enhancers, the observation that classical benzodiazepines (BZ, eg. diazepam) are amnesic, coupled with the preservation of GABA(A) receptors in brain areas most affected by AD, highlighted the GABA(A) receptor as a potential therapeutic target. In contrast to the amnesic BZ agonists, the BZ inverse agonists (eg. DMCM) which attenuate GABA(A) receptor function, have been shown to improve performance in animal models of learning and memory. Unfortunately, such non-selective ligands also induce anxiety and convulsions. More recently, novel ligands have been developed (eg. 6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophen-4(5H)-one) that demonstrate binding selectivity and high inverse agonism for the alpha5 GABA(A) receptor subtype, which is preferentially located in the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with learning and memory. Pre-clinical results are encouraging, since these alpha5 selective inverse agonists enhance memory in animal models, such as spatial learning in the Morris water-maze, but are devoid of the adverse effects associated with activity at other GABA(A) receptor subtypes in other brain regions. If the efficacy and safety profiles of alpha5 inverse agonists in humans prove to be similar to those seen in pre-clinical studies, these compounds would offer significant benefit to AD and MCI patients.", 
    "154": "With the exception of obsessive compulsive disorder, benzodiazepines (BZs) remain a major first line treatment for anxiety disorders. However, as well as being anxiolytic, BZs also cause sedation acutely, related to the fact that BZs are also used as hypnotics, and chronically may have abuse potential as well as cause physical dependence which manifests itself as the demonstration of a number of adverse events upon discontinuation. The molecular mechanisms of BZs are now well defined in that they enhance the actions of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by binding to a specific recognition site on GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 subunits. Compounds that bind at this modulatory site and enhance the inhibitory actions of GABA are classified as agonists, those that decrease the actions of GABA are termed inverse agonists whereas compounds which bind but have no effect on GABA inhibition are termed antagonists. The clinically used BZs are full agonists and between the opposite ends of the spectrum, i.e. full agonist and full inverse agonist, are a range of compounds with differing degrees of efficacy, such as partial agonists and partial inverse agonists. Attempts have been made to develop compounds which are anxioselective in that they retain the anxiolytic properties of the full agonist BZs but have reduced sedation and dependence (withdrawal) liabilities. Such compounds may interact with all four (i.e. alpha1-, alpha2-, alpha3- and alpha5-containing) GABA(A) receptor subtypes and have partial rather than full agonist efficacies. Examples of nonselective partial agonists include bretazenil, imidazenil, FG 8205, abecarnil, NS 2710, pagoclone, RWJ-51204 and (S)-desmethylzopiclone. Alternatively, a compound might have comparable binding affinity but different efficacies at the various subtypes, thereby preferentially exerting its effects at subtypes thought to be associated with anxiety (alpha2- and/or alpha3-containing receptors) rather than the subtype associated with sedation (alpha1-containing receptors). Examples of efficacy selective compounds include L-838417, NGD 91-3 and SL651498. For each compound, preclinical and where available clinical data will be reviewed. Emerging themes include the lack of definitive intrinsic efficacy data for certain compounds (e.g. abecarnil, ocinaplon, pagoclone) and the difficulty in translating robust anxiolysis and a separation between anxiolytic and sedative doses of non-selective partial agonists in preclinical species into consistent clinical benefit in man (e.g. bretazenil, abecarnil, pagoclone). With respect to efficacy selective compounds, NGD 91-3 was not anxiolytic in man but in the absence of efficacy data, these results are difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, efficacy selective compounds represent a novel approach to targeting specific subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor, the ultimate test of which will be evaluation in the clinic.", 
    "155": "A key issue for drug discovery in the post genomic era is target validation. This is particularly important when considering the CNS, where currently the majority of drug targets are neurotransmitter receptors that are known to exist as multi-gene families. The GABAergic system, which is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the CNS, is no exception in that respect. The GABA(A) receptors, which are the site of action of a number of clinically used drugs such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, exist in a large gene family. Existing drugs mediating their effects through the GABA(A) receptor are generally non-selective, i.e. will act at several subtypes of that receptor family. Thus, if we are both to refine existing therapeutic approaches, and develop novel approaches, a key question is to define which subtype(s) of the GABA(A) receptor family we should target; which will mediate the beneficial effects of a drug, and which could be responsible for unwanted side effects? One of the tools, which has been developed over the last decade to elucidate the function of a given gene, is the generation and analysis of gene-targeted mice. This review will summarize progress on identifying individual GABA(A) receptor subtypes as potential drug targets by using genetically modified mice.",

Sci. 1998, 38, 651-659.): (1) 51 benzodiazepine derivatives, (2) 37 carboquinone derivatives, (3) 74 pyrimidines, and (4) 31 antimycin analogues. These data sets were parameterized with 7, 6, 27, and 53 descriptors, respectively. Modeled properties were anti-pentylenetetrazole activity, antileukemic activity, inhibition constants to dihydrofolate reductase from MB1428 E. coli, and antifilarial activity, respectively. Nonlinearities were introduced into the MR models through 2-fold and/or 3-fold cross-products of initial (linear) descriptors. Then, using the CROMRsel and GFA programs (J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1999, 39, 121-132) the sets of I (I < or = 8, in this paper) the best descriptors (according to the fit and leave-one-out correlation coefficients) were selected for multiregression models. Two classes of models were obtained: (1) linear or nonlinear MR models which were generated starting from the complete set of descriptors, and (2) nonlinear MR models which were generated starting from the same set of descriptors that was used in the NNE modeling. In addition, the descriptor selection method from CROMRsel was compared with the GFA method included in the QSAR module of the Cerius2 program. For each data set it has been found that the MR models have better cross-validated statistical parameters than the corresponding NNE models and that CROMRsel selects somewhat better MR models than the GFA method. MR models are also much simpler than NNEs, which is the important surprising fact, and, additionally, express calculated dependencies in a functional form. Moreover, MR models were shown to be better than all other models obtained by different methods on the same data sets (\"old\" multivariate regressions, functional-link-net models, back-propagation neural networks, genetic algorithm, and partial least squares models). This study also indicated that the robust NNE models cannot generate good models when applied on small data sets, suggesting that it is perhaps better to apply robust methods (like NNE ones) on larger data sets.", 
    "157": "The potential use of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep effects as a biomarker for the therapeutic effects of antidepressants in healthy volunteers is reviewed. A literature search was performed to select studies investigating the effects of antidepressants on REM sleep. To assess the specificity of REM sleep effects as a biomarker, the effects of other central nervous system drugs on REM sleep were also investigated. A significant REM sleep reduction was shown for 16 of 21 investigated antidepressants after single-dose (mean reduction 34.1%) and for 11/13 drugs after multiple-dose administration (mean reduction 29.2%). The median increase in REM latency was approximatety 60% after single- or multiple-dose administration. REM sleep effects were linearly normalized to therapeutic doses, by dividing the REM sleep effect by the investigated dose and multiplying by the therapeutic dose. Normalized REM sleep effects were highly variable (range -27.0% to 81.8% for REM sleep; range -17.0% to 266.3% for REM latency) and demonstrated no relationship with relevant pharmacological properties of the investigated drugs. No quantifiable dose-response relationship could be constructed after single and multiple dose administration. REM sleep effects were not specific for antidepressants. Benzodiazepines, for example, caused an average dose normalized REM sleep reduction of 8.7% and a median 8.6% increase of REM latency. This review demonstrates that although REM sleep effects occur with most of the antidepressants, it is by itself of limited value as a biomarker for antidepressant action. The specificity for antidepressants is limited, and it does not show a quantitative dose-response relationship to antidepressant agents. This is at least partly due to the complex relationships between drug pharmacokinetics and the variable time course of REM and other sleep stages throughout the night. Models that take these complex relationships into account may provide more comprehensive and quantifiable results.", 
    "158": "Drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by interacting at post-synaptic GABA(A) receptors have long been used as hypnotics, sedatives, tranquillizers and anticonvulsants. In this category, benzodiazepines rapidly gained pride of place, replacing barbiturates and becoming the most commonly prescribed of all drugs in the Western world in the 1970s. However, problems such as dependence and withdrawal reactions became apparent in the 1980s, and it seemed that the usefulness of drugs with this mode of action was limited. Recently, focus has shifted to a new group of drugs with GABA-ergic actions mediated through various mechanisms not directly involving the GABA(A) receptor. These drugs include gabapentin, vigabatrin, tiagabine, lamotrigine, pregabalin and others. Although originally developed as anticonvulsants for epilepsy, they appear to have wider applications for use in affective disorders, especially bipolar depression, anxiety disorders and pain conditions. The current information on the properties and therapeutic potential of this new generation of GABA-ergic drugs is reviewed. It remains to be seen whether long-term use leads to tolerance, dependence and withdrawal or discontinuation reactions.", 
    "159": "Atypical antipsychotics generally have milder side-effects than conventional antipsychotics, but also differ among themselves in this respect. This study aimed to compare the impact of different side-effect profiles of individual atypical antipsychotics on non-compliance, relapse and cost in schizophrenia. A state-transition model was built using literature data supplemented by expert opinion. The model found that quetiapine and ziprasidone were similar in estimated non-compliance and relapse rates. Olanzapine and risperidone had higher estimated non-compliance and relapse rates, and incremental, 1-year, per-patient direct costs, using US-based cost data, of approximately $530 (95% confidence interval [CI] approximately $275, $800), and approximately $485 (95% CI approximately $235, $800), respectively, compared with quetiapine. Incremental costs attributable to different side-effect profiles were highly significant. This study shows that differing side-effect profiles of the newer antipsychotic agents are likely to lead to different compliance rates, and consequent variation in relapse rates. The cost implications of these heterogenous clinical outcomes are substantial.",

    "169": "A postal questionnaire was sent to all assisted conception units (ACUs) in the UK that undertake IVF. The return rate was 62 of 74 (84%). The majority of units (84%) used intravenous (i.v.) sedation for transvaginal egg collection, whereas 16% used general anaesthesia. There was a great deal of variation in personnel present during the procedure, the use of drugs, the degree of monitoring and the availability of emergency drugs. Most units titrate an i.v. benzodiazepine and i.v. opiate manually, usually midazolam and fentanyl, respectively. This audit demonstrates the wide variation in current UK practice and highlights the need for the adoption of national guidelines for safe use of i.v. sedation in ACUs.", 
    "170": "Neuroanatomical studies suggest that neuronal atrophy and destruction occur over the course of many years in neurodegenerative conditions such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In schizophrenia, early intervention with atypical neuroleptics such as olanzapine has been shown to prevent development of some of the more serious and debilitating symptoms in many patients. The mechanisms whereby olanzapine slows or prevents symptom progression in schizophrenia remain unclear. A previous study found that olanzapine increased mRNA for the copper/zinc isoform of the superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD-1). We investigated the effects of olanzapine in PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. We measured cell viability, observed evidence of necrosis and apoptosis, checked the SOD-1 mRNA by Northern blot analyses, and determined SOD-1 enzyme activity. We found that: (1) the decrease in cell viability induced by hydrogen peroxide was attenuated in PC12 cells pretreated with olanzapine; (2) olanzapine increased SOD enzyme activity in PC12 cells; (3) inhibiting SOD activity with diethyldithiocarbamic acid prevented the cytoprotective actions of olanzapine; and (4) the decrease in SOD-1 mRNA level induced by hydrogen peroxide was blocked by pretreatment with olanzapine. These data indicate that the neuroprotective action of olanzapine includes the upregulation of SOD.", 
    "171": "Life-threatening hyperthermia occurs in some individuals taking 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). In rabbits, sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction in heat-exchanging cutaneous beds (ear pinnae) contributes to MDMA-elicited hyperthermia. We investigated whether MDMA-elicited cutaneous vasoconstriction and hyperthermia are reversed by clozapine and olanzapine, atypical antipsychotic agents. Ear pinna blood flow and body temperature were measured in conscious rabbits; MDMA (6 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered; and clozapine (0.1-5 mg/kg, i.v.) or olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered 15 min later. One hour after MDMA, temperature was 38.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C in 5 mg/kg clozapine-treated rabbits and 39.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C in olanzapine-treated rabbits, less than untreated animals (41.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C) and unchanged from pre-MDMA values. Ear pinna blood flow increased from the MDMA-induced near zero level within 5 min of clozapine or olanzapine administration. Clozapine-induced temperature and flow responses were dose-dependent. In urethane-anesthetized rabbits, MDMA (6 mg/kg, i.v.) increased ear pinna postganglionic sympathetic nerve discharge to 217 +/- 33% of the pre-MDMA baseline. Five minutes after clozapine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) discharge was reduced to 10 +/- 4% of the MDMA-elicited level. In conscious rats made hyperthermic by MDMA (10 mg/kg, s.c.), body temperature 1 hr after clozapine (3 mg/kg, s.c.) was 36.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C, <38.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C (Ringer's solution-treated) and not different from the pre-MDMA level. One hour after clozapine, rat tail blood flow was 24 +/- 3 cm/sec, greater than both flow in Ringer's solution-treated rats (8 +/- 1 cm/sec) and the pre-MDMA level (17 +/- 1 cm/sec). Clozapine and olanzapine, by interactions with 5-HT receptors or by other mechanisms, could reverse potentially fatal hyperthermia and cutaneous vasoconstriction occurring in some humans after ingestion of MDMA."
