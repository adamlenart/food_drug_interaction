    "0": "Buspirone has been available in the United States for over four years for the treatment of anxiety. It was anticipated this drug would offer certain advantages over the established benzodiazepines. In contrast to diazepam, early studies found no evidence for the interaction of buspirone with GABAergic mechanisms. Behavioural, electrophysiological and receptor binding experiments gradually led to the idea that buspirone owes much of its anxiolytic activity to its ability to attenuate central 5-hydroxytryptamine neurotransmission. Specifically, it appears to act as an agonist at presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, particularly in the raphe nuclei. Although buspirone also shows an affinity for dopamine D2 receptors, where it seems to behave as an antagonist, there is much doubt that this effect is related to its anxiolytic action. Even though buspirone and the benzodiazepines do not obviously share a common mode of action, the possibility is discussed that there is an underlying common mechanism of responsible for their antianxiety effects.", 
    "1": "A clinical randomized investigation was undertaken to determine the value of midazolam as a narcotic adjuvant for anesthetic induction. Thirty ASA I-II adult patients undergoing selective surgery were allocated randomly into two groups to receive one of the following agents: midazolam 0.3 mg/kg, thiopental 5 mg/kg, or diazepam 0.4 mg/kg. The induction time as measured from the onset of injection to loss of the eyelash reflex was shortest in the case of thiopental; while a lower frequency of apnea, lesser suppression of circulation, and lack of venous irritation were points favoring midazolam. However, further study is needed to clarify the moderate cardiovascular response seen during intubation in some cases as well as to elucidate any patient population differences.", 
    "2": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a potent neuropeptide hormone with activity on various gastrointestinal organs during the digestive process. It was recently suggested that CCK may also act on the immune system. In this study we investigated the effect of CCK on the human mucosal immune system as represented by colonic lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL). Our results demonstrated that CCK at concentrations of 10(-13) M to 10(-7) M inhibits thymidine incorporation into Con A-stimulated LPL DNA by up to 40%. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was reversed by the specific CCK receptor antagonist, L-364718, at concentrations of 10(-8) M to 10(-5) M. In addition, CCK did not affect DNA synthesis of LPL stimulated with phorbol ester (PDB) and calcium ionophore (ionomycin). It is postulated that the CCK effect may involve intracellular metabolic steps proximal to protein kinase C activation and calcium flux. Our results suggest that CCK may play a role in modulating the human mucosal immune system during digestion and thus, should be added to the list of the neuropeptides that affect the mucosal immune system.", 
    "3": "An endogenous peptide, named diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) capable of displacing benzodiazepines from binding sites has been recently fully characterized. In order to clearly identify the cell types responsible for the biosynthesis of DBI in the rat central nervous system, we have performed high resolution in situ hybridization in the area postrema, hypothalamus and cerebellum, using a [35S]-labeled single stranded RNA probe. Hybridization signal was detected in both semithin and ultrathin sections. In all the brain areas examined, specific labeling was exclusively observed in non-neuronal cells including ependymal and subependymal cells bordering the third ventricle. The results obtained clearly establish that DBI is synthesized by non-neuronal cells in the rat brain.", 
    "4": "A family is reported in which 11 members in 4 generations had a benign form of essential myoclonus of early onset. The myoclonic jerks were mostly asynchronous and dysrhythmic. They occurred spontaneously when relaxed, induced by movement, increased in tonus and emotional stress. Generalized seizures was found in 3 members who also had essential myoclonus. The relationship between essential myoclonus and idiopathic epilepsy was stressed. Beneficial effect was obtained with alcohol and clonazepam.", 
    "5": "1. The long-term maintenance of metabolism of representative drugs and steroid hormone substrates by cytochromes P-450, and their inducibility, was investigated in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes. Collagenase-isolated cells were seeded on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes and cultured in Chee's essential media in the presence or absence of phenobarbital (PB, 0.75 mM, 96 h or continuously) and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC, 5 microM, 48 h) for up to 45 days. 2. Hepatic P-450-dependent metabolism of diazepam to its primary oxidized metabolite was inducible by PB both in vivo (monitored in isolated liver microsomes) and in cultured cells (up to 100% and 400% increases in the formation of temazepam and nordiazepam, respectively, after 25 days in culture). Hepatocyte microsomal androstenedione 16 beta-hydroxylase activity was also induced by PB treatment of the hepatocytes (350-650% increase in 20-day-old cells). 3. Western blot analysis revealed that immunoreactive P-450 form PB-4 (IIB1), which catalysed the N-demethylation of diazepam to yield nordiazepam as well as androstenedione 16 beta-hydroxylation when assayed in a purified enzyme system, was substantially elevated following PB treatment of the cultured cells. Similarly, MC induced 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity (up to 2000% increase from 5 to 45 days) as well as immunoreactive P-450c (IA1) in the hepatocyte cultures. 4. These studies demonstrate that cytochrome P-450 activities can be maintained, and also induced, after extended periods of time in hepatocytes cultured using a simple collagen mixture as substrate and a commercially available tissue culture media. This culture system should provide an important tool for further studies of P-450-dependent xenobiotic metabolism in a well-defined, liver-derived cellular system.", 
    "6": "1. Agonist-antagonist interactions at acetylcholine (ACh) muscarinic receptors have been analysed by use of an improved urinary bladder assay, isolated and intact, from the mouse. With 5-methylfurmethide as agonist, validated cumulative concentration-effect curves were obtained in less than 7 min by re-dosing before the response plateaux began to fade. 2. The pKB value estimated for pirenzepine was 6.76. The pKB values estimated for atropine and N-methylatropine from data obtained at concentrations which produced dose-ratios greater than 20 and 60 were 8.90 and 9.58, respectively. 3. The deviation from simple competitive behaviour at low dose-ratios with atropine and N-methylatropine was consistent with the operation of saturable antagonist removal processes. The deviation observed with atropine was corrected by pre-incubation with methylbutyrate, an alternative substrate for 'atropine esterase'. 4. The simple competitive behaviour of N-methylatropine was restored following pre-incubation with the neuronal choline uptake blocker hemicholinium-3 (HC-3). However, the pKB estimated for N-methylatropine under these conditions was low. This latter result could be accounted for by the observed behaviour of HC-3 as a competitive antagonist of ACh muscarinic receptors (pKB = 4.01). 5. We conclude that the modified mouse urinary bladder assay is suitable for the quantitative analysis of muscarinic receptor interactions. In addition, we postulate the existence of a previously undescribed uptake mechanism for quaternary muscarinic receptor antagonists.", 
    "7": "We have developed a new extraction technique for nitrazepam and diazepam using Samplex C-18 column. The blood-extractions containing diazepam and nitrazepam were diluted with acetonitrile-water 7:3 eluent. Diazepam and nitrazepam were isolated using liquid-liquid extraction technique. The blood-extracts were diluted with chloroform-ethanol 1:1 and they were evaluated by using OPLC method. Evaluation was done by TLC-scanner (Shimadzu). The efficiency and sensitivity of the methods have been compared.", 
    "8": "The efficacy of antidepressants is well established in major depressions, especially those with melancholic features. However, some anxiolytics also appear to have antidepressant properties at least for outpatients. 118 outpatients (25 males, 93 females, age: 18-60) with major depression according to DSM-III criteria, neither melancholic nor suicidal, reaching at least 27 on Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and 19 on Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HARS) accepted to participate this double blind study carried out by 15 G.P.s coordinated by 3 psychiatrists. After a one week placebo wash-out-single-blind period, they were randomly, double blind, assigned to one of the two following groups: PR treated with prazepam (30-60 mg), a benzodiazepine anxiolytic or CL treated clomipramine, an imipramine antidepressant (75-150 mg). Patients were evaluated at days 0, 7, 14, and 28, using MADRS, HARS, Clinical Global Impression and Hopkins symptoms check list 58. In addition, G.P.s had to meet monthly for a case discussion group.",

    "10": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and central hemodynamics (CH) have been studied during anesthesia and after surgery in patients with tumours located in brain hemispheres. CBF and CH were determined by radiography. GOBA, diazepam and sodium thiopental were used for anesthesia. It has been shown that GOBA fails to normalize CBF both during and after surgery, diazepam normalizes blood flow in both brain hemispheres. Sodium thiopental leads to further CBF depression up to critical level in the affected hemisphere with parallel blood flow ingress in the intact brain hemisphere. It is concluded that the use of diazepam is advisable for anesthesia during surgery for tumours located in brain hemispheres.", 
    "11": "The effect of physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on the loss of consciousness induced by three different intravenous induction anesthetics, namely midazolam, etomidate and althesin at ED50, was studied in three comparable groups of patients. Ten min before induction, the first and second groups received physostigmine 8 micrograms/kg and 16 micrograms/kg, respectively, and the third group received 2 ml of saline solution. Physostigmine 16 micrograms/kg resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of unconscious patients with midazolam (from 50% to 10%), but it did not modify the incidence with etomidate or althesin. Physostigmine at doses of 8 micrograms/kg and 16 micrograms/kg could cause 6.7% and 10% nausea, respectively. Although the mechanism of the drug interaction of physostigmine and midazolam is unclear, physostigmine could be used clinically to reverse post-anesthetic somnolence induced by midazolam.", 
    "12": "In this article, the effects of different classes of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists in CCK-related physiological processes of the pancreas have been discussed. Both glutaramic acid derivatives and natural (benzodiazepine) analogs are potent, competitive antagonists of peripheral CCK receptors. These compounds thus provide a powerful tool for investigating the physiological and pharmacological actions of CCK in the gastrointestinal system, and have already clarified the role of CCK in pancreatic secretion and trophism or growth.", 
    "13": "To evaluate drug utilization during the last 15 days of pregnancy, one hundred six women were interviewed post-delivery in the CHU Bretonneau in Tours. Eighty-three percent received at least one drug during the 15 days preceding delivery and 27% more than 3 different drugs. Treatments for venous disorders (31% of patients), iron (31%), analgesics (25%), antacids (11%), magnesium (11%) and laxatives (11%) were most frequently used. In 92% of cases the drug was prescribed. Five women received a drug with potential risk for the neonate. However only one infant developed and adverse effect, possibly due to benzodiazepine (hypotonia).", 
    "14": "In the course of 1979 the Netherlands Centre for Monitoring of Adverse Reactions to Drugs (NARD) received a remarkably large number of reports on patients with unusual and complex psychic disturbances, attributed to the use of the then recently marketed hypnotic triazolam. The interpretation of the data was difficult, however, and several questions could at that time not be properly answered. In the past 10 years a specific benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been identified, showing many similarities with the disturbances as reported in association with triazolam. In addition similar adverse experiences with triazolam have been reported in many other countries. Tablets containing 1 mg and 0.5 mg triazolam, as were widely used in the Netherlands, have in the mean time been globally removed from the market. It is concluded that the triazolam syndrome may be explained as a combination of strong benzodiazepine effects and withdrawal phenomena. The ultra short half-life of triazolam and the high doses used may have contributed to the problems as observed in the Netherlands. The signal perceived by the NARD appears to have been a valuable warning, rightly casting doubt on the safety of triazolam and the original dosage recommendations.", 
    "15": "We compared cholinergic bronchial muscle contractions induced by vagus nerve (preganglionic) stimulation (VNS) with those induced by electrical field (postganglionic) stimulation (EFS). When normalized to their respective maximum response, the frequency-response curves (10 s trains) between 4 and 16 Hz were similar between VNS and EFS; however, at frequencies of 0.1-2 Hz, and at frequencies greater than 32 Hz, the VNS contractions were significantly less than EFS. When contractions elicited by 100 pulses were examined, it was found that the responses to VNS were maximal at 10-30 Hz then declined significantly to 82-35% of maximal between 40 and 200 Hz, whereas the response to EFS was essentially unchanged at frequencies up to 60 Hz and declined only to 72% of maximal up to 200 Hz. At frequencies as low as 20 Hz, the contractions evoked by VNS faded to 45 +/- 9% of the peak contraction during 60 sec of continuous stimulation, whereas those evoked by 60 sec continuous EFS remained constant. This fade observed during prolonged VNS was not blocked by the antagonists, pirenzepine and AFDX-116, at concentrations selective for M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively; nor was the fade blocked by pre-treatment with indomethacin, propranolol, phentolamine, or choline. At frequencies greater than 10 Hz, the amplitude of the preganglionic compound action potential also faded during repetitive stimulation. The results support the hypothesis that the airway ganglion neurons innervating guinea pig bronchial smooth muscle effectively filter preganglionic stimuli, especially at low and relatively high frequencies. During continuous vagus nerve stimulation, preganglionic mechanisms may also play a role in limiting the ultimate output of airway ganglia.", 
    "16": "We analyzed patients treated during the past five years with botulinum toxin type A for strabismus and blepharospasm, reviewed our successes, failures, and unusual cases, and drew conclusions based on these treatments. Thirty-seven percent of the strabismus patients were cured, but many patients who were outside the strict definitions, still believed that they were significantly improved. A prominent feature in the treatment of strabismus was variability. Frequently, patients expected to do poorly had encouraging results. One permanent overcorrection occurred, and it converted an esotopic patient into an exotropic one with diplopia. This has persisted for 2.5 years and is the longest reported overcorrection to our knowledge. Our results indicate that larger doses of botulinum toxin produce longer spasm-free intervals in the treatment of blepharospasm. One patient receiving injections for her blepharospasm discovered that its cause was her sedative medication. This is the first reported case of a benzodiazepine inducing blepharospasm to our knowledge.", 
    "17": "Studies were performed in the rabbit aortic rings, precontracted with norepinephrine, to determine the subtype(s) of muscarinic receptors involved in endothelium-dependent relaxation and contraction in the absence of endothelium elicited by cholinergic stimuli. Acetylcholine (ACh) and arecaidine propargyl ester (APE), a M2 and M3 agonist, produced a dose-dependent relaxation and contraction in endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded rabbit aortic rings, respectively. Both of these responses were blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. M1 selective agonist McN-A-343 [4-[N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyloxy]-2-butinyltrimethylammonium+ ++ chloride] did not produce any effect on the tone of precontracted aortic rings. ACh- and APE-induced relaxation in aortic rings with intact endothelium was selectively blocked by M3 receptor antagonists hexahydrosila-difenidol and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pA2 of 7.84 and 7.18) but not by M1 antagonist pirenzepine or M2 receptor antagonists AF-DX 116 [11-(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]- 1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido-[2,3-b][1,4]-benzo-diazepin-6-one] and methoctramine. ACh- and APE-induced contraction was inhibited by M2 receptor antagonists AF-DX 116 and methoctramine (pA2 of 7.11 and 6.71) but not by pirenzepine, hexahydro-sila-difenidol or p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol. ACh- and APE-induced relaxation or contraction were not altered by nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium or cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. These data suggest that relaxation elicited by cholinergic stimulin in endothelium-intact aortic rings is mediated via release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor consequent to activation of M3 receptors located on endothelial cells, whereas the contraction in aortic rings denuded of their endothelium is mediated via stimulation of M2 receptors located on smooth muscle cells.", 
    "18": "Serosal addition of muscarinic agonists elicited rapid changes in electrical parameters across the isolated canine esophageal epithelium set up in vitro. Both carbachol and the M1-selective agonist, McNeil A343 (McN), increased transmucosal potential differences (PDs), decreased transmucosal resistances (R), and increased short-circuit currents (Isc). Carbachol was more potent and more effective than McN. Muscarinic antagonists were used to define the muscarinic receptor involved. The pA2 values obtained with Schild plots were as follows: atropine 9.14, 4-DAMP 8.98, AFDX-116 6.71, and pirenzepine 7.12. Low concentrations of pirenzepine (10(-8) M), produced a rightward shift in the dose-response curve to McN, without inhibiting responses to carbachol. Thus the receptor subtype is clearly not an M2. As in other glandular systems, M3 receptors are present. Whether M1 receptors also exist requires better definition of receptor densities-reserves in this tissue. Carbachol induced net secretion of Na and Cl and converted a predominantly absorptive tissue to a secretory one.", 
    "19": "The course and results of treatment of delirium tremens in 218 patients and pre-delirium syndrome in 569 patients treated in the Psychiatric Department of the Hospital for Miners in Bytom between 1966 and 1984 was analysed. During this period there was found mitigation in the severity of the psychosis and a fall in the number of patients displaying the fully developed syndrome in relation to patients suffering from abortive forms (pre-delirium syndromes). Among the patients treated no deaths were noted. In the opinion of the authors the use of appropriate psychotropic drugs in patients with DT is only one of the many factors influencing the course of this psychosis. As important and often more important is intensive somatic treatment of patients in a severe general condition.",

    "21": "To assess the possible interactions of midazolam and thiopental with the muscular relaxants vecuronium (0.08 mg/kg), atracurium (0.5 mg/kg), and pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg), a comparative analysis was undertaken in two groups of 18 and 32 patients treated respectively with midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) and thiopental (5 mg/kg). The beginning of the effect, maximal blockade, duration of the clinical response, and the spontaneous recovery index were measured on electromyographic recordings of action potentials evoked by train of four supramaximal stimuli delivered every 20 sec on the ulnar nerve. Conditions for intubation were assessed 2 minutes after administration of muscular relaxant. There were no significant differences in neuromuscular parameters in either of the two groups of patients treated with midazolam or with thiopental independently of the relaxant drug administered.", 
    "22": "The aim of the study was to examine myorelaxant and analgetic effects of tetrazepam using double-blind controlled random tests. The study comprised two groups of patients with 30 subjects in each with reflex muscle spasms in the lumbar and cervical spine. One group was treated with a nonsteroid analgetic and the another one with the combination of tetrazepam and a nonsteroid analgetic. The treatment lasted 15 days and the assessment using the standardized, graded scale was performed 0, 7 and 15 days after the onset of the treatment. More hematologic and biochemical parameters were analysed both at the beginning and completion of the treatment. The results of the study have shown that the combination of nonsteroid analgetics and tetrazepam achieved better and faster effects on pain and muscle spasms compared to nonsteroid analgetics with no significant side effects.", 
    "23": "The therapeutic value of propranolol and other beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in anxiety disorders is reviewed. The potential side-effects of benzodiazepines, eg psychomotor impairment and dependance, suggest that the main indicators of these compounds are the acute anxiety states and the short term treatment of anxiety disorders requiring sedation. Thus, other psychotropic drugs may be of potential value in the treatment of these disorders. The results of the placebo-controlled studies reviewed here strongly suggest that propranolol is useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders, especially those: 1) characterized by the presence of somatic symptoms related to increased adrenergic tone; 2) of moderate intensity and/or seen in general practice; 3) of recent onset and not fulfilling DSM III criteria for specific chronic anxiety disorders. Propranolol and other beta-blockers may also be useful in the prevention of performance anxiety such as the fear of speaking in public or specific social phobias when limited in number in the same patients. Average therapeutic doses range from 20 to 40 mg, once to three times a day; the clinical efficacy of beta-blockers administered for periods longer than 4 weeks remains to be demonstrated. The potential impairment of cognitive functions by propranolol is still a matter of controversy as well as its ability to induce depressive states in predisposed patients. Furthermore, the efficacy of beta-blockers that do not cross the blood-brain barrier in the treatment of anxiety raises unresolved questions concerning the mode of action (central vs peripheric) of these medications. In short, beta-blocking agents, and especially propranolol, should be considered as potential therapeutic agents in the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders besides benzodiazepines, antidepressant compounds and the newer azapirones, eg buspirone.", 
    "24": "1. The behavioural effects of a selective cholecystokininB (CCKB) receptor antagonist CI-988 were investigated in rodents. 2. In three rodent tests of anxiety (rat elevated X-maze, rat social interaction test and mouse light/dark box) CI-988 over the dose range 0.001-10.0 mg kg-1, (i.p.) produced an anxiolytic-like action. The magnitude of this effect was similar to that of chlordiazepoxide (CDP). In contrast, the selective CCKA receptor antagonist, devazepide, was inactive. CI-988 also showed anxiolytic-like action in the rat conflict test but the magnitude of this effect was about 2.5 fold less than that of CDP. 3. Central but not peripheral administration of the selective CCKB receptor agonist, pentagastrin, like FG 7142, produced an anxiogenic-like action. 4. The pentagastrin-induced anxiety was dose-dependently antagonized by CI-988, whereas devazepide was inactive. However, ten times higher doses of CI-988 were required to block a similar action of FG 7142. 5. In contrast to CDP, CI-988 up to 3000 fold higher doses than those inducing anxiolysis was inactive in tests measuring sedation and ataxia. It also failed to antagonize pentylenetetrazol-induced tonic seizures. Furthermore, CI-988 did not interact with alcohol or barbiturates. Thus, CI-988 appears to be an anxioselective compound. 6. The anxiolytic-like action of CDP in the rat elevated X-maze was dose-dependently antagonized by flumazenil. In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist failed to block a similar effect of CI-988. 7. Thus, CI-988 shows anxiolytic-like activity in several animal models of anxiety. The anxiolytic-like effect of CI-988 involves a novel mechanism of action, that is likely to be mediated by selective antagonism of the brain CCKB receptor. It is suggested that CI-988 should have a better side-effect profile in man than the benzodiazepines.", 
    "25": "Umespirone was compared to buspirone, diazepam and clozapine as a potential anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent. In the mouse black and white test box, umespirone was considerably more potent than diazepam or buspirone to reduce aversive responding, tolerance to its effects was not observed and sedation was absent, a chronic treatment and withdrawal was not associated with an anxiogenic profile, and umespirone prevented the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from diazepam. Umespirone also had an anxiolytic profile of action in the tests of rat social interaction and in the marmoset exposed to a human threat. Both umespirone and clozapine reduced the hyperactivity induced by the infusion of dopamine into the nucleus accumbens of rat. In radioligand binding assays umespirone demonstrated nanomolar affinity for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor and the 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors. It is concluded that umespirone may present as a novel psychotropic agent with anxiolytic and antipsychotic potential.", 
    "26": "Anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs are extensively prescribed for elderly individuals throughout Western society. Old age may be associated with an altered clinical response to this class of compounds, and there is a considerable ethical and economic stake in understanding these changes so that therapy may be approached with a maximum likelihood of therapeutic benefit and a minimum risk of side effects. Old age may lead to altered pharmacokinetics of sedative-anxiolytic drugs, causing higher plasma concentrations (relative to young individuals) after single or multiple doses. By far the majority of the available scientific data refer to the benzodiazepines, which have become the most widely prescribed class of sedative-anxiolytic drugs. Although there is not complete consistency in the available data, the weight of evidence indicates that old age is associated with impaired clearance of the benzodiazepines which are biotransformed by microsomal oxidation (such as diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, desalkylflurazepam, bromazepam, alprazolam, triazolam and others). For those benzodiazepines metabolised mainly by glucuronide conjugation (oxazepam, lorazepam, temazepam) or nitroreduction (nitrazepam), there are minimal, if any, age-related decrements in clearance. Only in the case of triazolam is there direct evidence linking impaired clearance to enhanced clinical effects in the elderly. The logical suggestion that benzodiazepines biotransformed by conjugation or by nitroreduction may be safer for the elderly than those biotransformed by oxidation has not yet been directly validated. Reasonable epidemiological evidence has linked the use of long (versus short) half-life benzodiazepines (regardless of the specific metabolic pathway) with an increased incidence of adverse reactions such as confusion, falls and hip fractures in elderly persons. However, the decreased clearance and increased accumulation of the benzodiazepines in question are not clearly validated as the cause of the increased frequency of adverse reactions. Old age may also be associated with an increased intrinsic sensitivity to benzodiazepines; that is, enhanced pharmacodynamic response, relative to young individuals, at any given plasma or target organ concentration. This change in sensitivity may coexist with, or be independent of, alterations in pharmacokinetics. Altered benzodiazepine sensitivity has been documented both in the course of clinical use of benzodiazepines prior to endoscopy or cardioversion, and in placebo-controlled laboratory trials. Animal models of aging have validated an enhanced response to benzodiazepines as a consequence of impaired clearance, increased intrinsic sensitivity or both. However, many studies directly assessing benzodiazepine receptor affinity, density and function in aging animals have failed to identify significant age-related changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "27": "A spectrum of quantitative and qualitative methods was adapted to the RA-1000/RA-XT selective analyser for the purpose of excluding or detecting common types of intoxication in the emergency laboratory of our primary care community hospital. Ethanol and salicylates (measured photometrically) and acetaminophen (measured immunologically by EMIT tox) were quantitatively analysed in serum. immunological group tests (EMIT tox) for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants and related compounds were used for qualitative analysis. Well established clinical chemical methods (aspartarte aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, pseudocholinesterase, glucose and lactate) were applied to the serum samples using the same selective analyser. Within and between run precision, accuracy, recovery and detection ranges (linearity) fulfilled the recommendations of forefield toxicological analysis for all methods. Ethanol (g/l), measured photometrically with the RA-1000 analyser, agreed with the reference method (headspace gas-chromatography) with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 (y = 0.06 + 0.98x). Acetaminophen and salicylates showed correlation coefficients greater than 0.94 and greater than 0.99, when compared with manual colorimetric procedures (acetaminophen (mg/l): y = -3.22 + 0.896x; salicylates (mg/l): y = -2.1 + 1x). Qualitative group tests for barbiturates, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants measured with the RA-1000 analyser were in good agreement with the EMIT single test procedure. The ranges of the quantitative methods allowed quantification of analytes from therapeutic (non-toxic) to very high levels in undiluted samples (ethanol 0.05 up to 4 g/l; salicylates 32 up to 1200 mg/l and acetaminophen 1.9 up to 200 mg/l). The low detection limits of the qualitative tests allowed the recognition of compounds in plasma that were present in low concentrations and/or displayed only minor reactivity with the antibodies provided by the EMIT tox test kits. As a consequence, decision limits for all three group tests in serum were lowered to near the detection limit: (table: see text) For quantitative tests the lower limits of quantification were: (table: see text) The working reagents were stable for at least 14 days at 4-8 degrees C. Calibration curves were stable over the expiration period of reconstituted original reagents (6-12 weeks), also when working reagents were prepared in aliquots from stored reconstituted reagents. Application of the newly adapted programme to serum samples of nearly two hundred patients showed it to be suitable for screening patients in which intoxication is suspected or needs to be excluded.", 
    "28": "Degranulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) granulocytes, complement activation, and the endocrine metabolic response to hysterectomy were compared in two groups of patients receiving either general anaesthesia (GA group) or combined epidural analgesia and general anaesthesia (GAE group). The B-leucocyte and the cortisol responses were attenuated in the GAE group. There was no sign of complement activation. The post-operative rise in elastase-alpha-1-proteinase levels 4 h post-operatively on the first, second and third post-operative days was similar in the two groups. Plasma lactoferrin values were significantly elevated 4 h post-operatively and reached pre-operative values on Day 1 in both groups. Attenuation of the surgical stress response during uncomplicated hysterectomy did not influence the post-operative increase in proteinase activity. Mediators generated at the site of surgical trauma may account for the PMN degranulation observed after major surgery.",

High affinity was found in some cycloalkyl-annelated [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5(6H)-ones and in some 7,8,9,10-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin- 5(6H)-ones, in which the degree of activity was strongly dependent on the N-substituent in the 9-position. Nine compounds with BZ receptor IC50 binding affinity values equal or superior to diazepam were evaluated in secondary screening. One of these, 9-benzyl-2-phenyl-7,8,9,10-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-e] [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5(6H)-one, showed good activity in rats as a potential anxiolytic agent without sedative liability. However, it increased the rotorod deficit produced by ethanol at anxiolytic doses, an indication of alcohol interaction. Thus, none of the compounds showed an advantage over CGS 9896 (Yokoyama et al. J. Med. Chem. 1982, 25, 337-339), which is free of sedative and alcohol interaction potential as measured by the test procedures described.", 
    "30": "The several benzodiazepine hypnotics currently marketed differ in onset and duration of action and in side effect profile. These differences are largely based on the varying pharmacodynamic properties of these agents. The selection of a drug for treating an individual patient should be based on consideration of these pharmacologic differences, as well as assessment of the sleep-wake disorder. The initial objective for the clinician who intends to manage a patient with insomnia is to determine which factors are contributing to the sleep disturbance and to decide on a treatment strategy. If medication is to be used, then the physician should select the most effective and safest hypnotic, prescribe it at the lowest effective dose and for the fewest number of nights. Individual patient response to the chosen medication should be monitored.", 
    "31": "Five benzodiazepine derivatives are currently approved for the treatment of sleep disorders. Important differences exist among the drugs in the physicochemical properties of lipid solubility and protein binding and in pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance. These differences may account for observed variations in clinical action and side effects during and after treatment. Bases for understanding and predicting differences among benzodiazepine hypnotics are discussed.", 
    "32": "Although over 20 years of clinical experience with benzodiazepine hypnotics have demonstrated their relative safety, flurazepam, temazepam, triazolam, and quazepam do not have identical safety profiles. Dose-related central nervous system (CNS) depression such as daytime sedation and psychomotor impairment may be expected because they are an extension of the therapeutic action of these agents. Therefore, drug dose is an important factor in determining the expected frequency and severity of these side effects. Also, it is important for a clinician not to assume that these unwanted CNS effects relate only to the length of a drug's half-life. Half-life does appear to be an important determinant of the presence or absence of rebound insomnia.", 
    "33": "Daytime residual drowsiness and psychomotor performance were assessed for two long half-life benzodiazepines, quazepam and flurazepam, in two randomized, parallel, and double-blind studies in insomniacs. Seventeen middle-aged patients took quazepam 15 mg or 30 mg, or flurazepam 30 mg; the 47-night study included 4 placebo baseline nights, 28 consecutive treatment nights, and 15 posttreatment nights. Forty-eight geriatric patients took either flurazepam 15 mg, quazepam 15 mg, or placebo; the 15-night study included 1 placebo baseline night, 7 treatment nights, and 7 posttreatment nights. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), an objective test for measuring daytime sleepiness, and performance tests were administered. In the first study, flurazepam patients were significantly (p less than .05) sleepier after the 7th and 14th treatment nights when compared to baseline, whereas quazepam patients were not. In the second study, flurazepam patients were sleepier at midday (p less than .10) and late afternoon (p less than .05) after 1 treatment week than were quazepam and placebo patients. Performance test results suggested quazepam has a relatively low potential for daytime impairment. Thus, quazepam 15 mg produces less daytime somnolence and fewer psychomotor performance decrements than does flurazepam.", 
    "34": "Quazepam and flurazepam share pharmacokinetic properties that result in prevention of early-morning insomnia, daytime rebound anxiety, and withdrawal rebound insomnia. Yet sleep laboratory and performance studies demonstrated that during a 1- to 4-week administration period quazepam had a low potential for causing daytime drowsiness or impairment. This profile may be related to several factors, such as differences in quazepam's metabolic pathways; plasma pharmacokinetics; rate of brain uptake, redistribution, and clearance; as well as differences in receptor binding and kinetics.", 
    "35": "Quazepam and its major metabolite, 2-oxoquazepam, were the first benzodiazepine (BZ) compounds shown to be capable of differentiating between central nervous system (CNS) subtypes of BZ receptors. Initial studies suggested that quazepam preferentially binds to the BZ1-receptor population with high affinity at relatively low doses. Subsequent binding experiments, performed in both human and rodent brain, confirmed this hypothesis for both the parent compound and its principal metabolite. Autoradiographic studies revealed a differential distribution of BZ1 and BZ2 receptors within regions of the brain associated with behavior, sensory input, control of movement, and coordination. BZ1 receptors are concentrated in specific, well-localized regions of the brain. BZ2 receptors are more widespread and diffusely localized throughout most brain regions. These observations suggest that a selective BZ1 agent such as quazepam might have a different pharmacologic profile than other nonselective benzodiazepines. Restricting the number of sites where BZ drugs act has been proposed as a strategy for producing a more circumscribed therapeutic effect; the BZ1 selectivity of quazepam embodies this concept.", 
    "36": "Two groups of rats were trained to discriminate either a low (1 mg/kg) or a high (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneal dose of diazepam from vehicle injections in a two-lever, food-reinforcement procedure. Comparison of the dose-response curves demonstrated a difference in the intensity of the stimulus effects. A number of benzodiazepine agonists and partial agonists were tested for stimulus generalization. The stimulus effect in both groups of rats generalized fully to triazolam, alprazolam, adinazolam and pentobarbital. Ro 17-1812 occasioned nearly full generalization in both groups of rats with a shallow dose-response slope. The low-, but not the high-dose stimulus effect generalized to the following compounds: CL 218872, ZK 91296 (ethyl-5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-B-carboline-3-carboxylate), CGS 20625 (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10-octahydrocyclohepta(b)pyrazo lo(3,4- d)pyridin-3-one) and U-78875 (3-(5-cyclo-propyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-(1- methylethyl)imidazol(1,5-a)quinoxalin-4(5H)-o-ne). Flumazenil, FD-7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide), buspirone and morphine occasioned predominantly vehicle-appropriate responses in both groups of rats. In the low-dose group, pretreatment with flumazenil (10 mg/kg) reduced responding on the diazepam-lever for the following compounds: diazepam, Ro 17-1812 (cyclopropylmethyl-(S)-8-chloro-12,12a-dihydro- 9-oxo-9H,11H-aceto(2,1-C)imidazo(1,5-a)(1,4)benzo-diazepine-1-carboxylat e), ZK 91296, CGS 20625, CL 218872 and U-78875.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Antipsychotic drugs are frequently used (and sometimes overused) to manage behavioral problems, especially in demented patients. All antipsychotics theoretically work through the same mechanism, so drug selection is based primarily on side effect profiles. In this article, we provide prescribing guidelines for antipsychotics and other psychoactive drugs used in the treatment of elderly patients with emotional dysfunction. Included are stimulants, lithium, carbamazepine, propranolol HCl, and buspirone HCl. Guidelines for benzodiazepines and antidepressants were discussed in part 1 of this two-part article (page 40).", 
    "38": "The effects of acute and repeated immobilization stress on central GABAergic function were examined in rats by evaluating the changes of the cardiovascular responses to intracerebroventricular injection of GABA. The depressor and bradycardia responses of GABA were attenuated significantly by immobilization stress for 6 h (from -5.5 +/- 0.7 kPa and -75 +/- 25 bpm to -2.3 +/- 0.9 kPa and -27 +/- 16 bpm respectively, for GABA 200 micrograms). These effects of stress were neither mimicked by administration of hydrocortisone, nor abolished by pretreatment with adrenalectomy or diazepam, but they were attenuated significantly by pretreatment with isoniazid. These results indicated that immobilization stress for long duration causes subsensitivity of central GABA receptors, in which the down-regulation mechanism may be involved.", 
    "39": "The effects of gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and bombesin on the DNA synthesis, as a biochemical indicator of trophic action in the gastroduodenal mucosa and the pancreas, have been examined in rats fasted for 48 h and in rats refed for 16 h with or without administration of specific receptor antagonists for bombesin, gastrin and CCK. Bombesin and gastrin administered three times daily for 48 h in fasted rats significantly increased the rate of DNA synthesis as measured by the incorporation of [3H] thymidine into DNA in each tissue tested. CCK significantly increased DNA synthesis in the duodenal mucosa and pancreatic tissue, but not in the gastric mucosa. The stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by bombesin in the gastroduodenal mucosa and pancreas was abolished by bombesin/GRP receptor antagonist, RC-3095. RC-3095 did not affect DNA synthesis stimulated by gastrin and CCK in these tissues. L-365,260, a receptor antagonist for gastrin suppressed the DNA synthesis induced by gastrin but not by CCK or bombesin in the gastrointestinal mucosa and pancreas. L-364,718, a specific antagonist for CCK receptors was effective only against CCK stimulated duodenal mucosa and pancreatic growth. Refeeding of 48 h fasting rats strongly enhanced the DNA synthesis in all tissues tested, and this effect was significantly reduced in the gastroduodenal mucosa by blocking only gastrin receptors (with L-365, 260) and that in the duodenal mucosa and the pancreas by antagonizing of CCK receptors (with L-364,718). Antagonism of bombesin receptors (with RC-3095) did not significantly affect the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by refeeding in all tissues tested. This study indicates that the stimulation of DNA synthesis can be achieved by exogenous gastrin, CCK and bombesin acting through separate receptors, but that only gastrin and CCK play the major role in the postprandial stimulation of the growth of gastroduodenal mucosa and pancreatic tissue.", 
    "40": "The anticonvulsant effects of felbamate alone or in combination with diazepam were investigated against maximal electroshock-, pentylenetetrazol-, isoniazid- and bicuculline-induced seizures in mice. A single subprotective dose of felbamate, a dose which offers no protection to animals when combined with diazepam, enhanced the protective effects of diazepam against seizures induced by electroshock, pentylenetetrazol and isoniazid, as measured by significant reduction of ED50 values. However, felbamate failed to significantly affect the protective action of diazepam against bicuculline. Felbamate does not interact directly with the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex. Thus the enhancement of anticonvulsant activity of diazepam by felbamate against maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol may involve an indirect effect at benzodiazepine receptors. The anticonvulsant action of felbamate against isoniazid does not seem to involve benzodiazepine receptors and may be due to reversing the inhibitory effect of isoniazid on glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity. The interaction between felbamate and diazepam may also involve other mechanisms.", 
    "41": "Studies conducted by Fisons Pharmaceuticals and the Antiepileptic Drug Development Program (ADD Program) of the Epilepsy Branch (NINDS, NIH) revealed that 'remacemide' (FPL 12924, formerly PR 934-423) was effective orally in the prevention of maximal electroshock seizures (MES) in rats. In this context (-)stereoisomer (FPL 14145) was of equal potency to the racemate (remacemide), while the (+)stereoisomer (FPL 14144) was 54% less potent. With respect to neurotoxicity, remacemide and its enantiomers possessed more favorable therapeutic indices than phenobarbital and valproate and less favorable indices than phenytoin and carbamazepine. The duration of protection of rats in the MES test at the ED50 or 3 x ED50 of remacemide and the (+)isomer was better or on par with the best reference compounds, phenytoin and phenobarbital. After subchronic administration of either the ED50 or the ED97 of remacemide, no tolerance developed in the hexobarbital sleep test, however, the activities of 3 hepatic microsomal enzymes were elevated. In naive rats high doses of remacemide or its (-)isomer and low doses of phenobarbital caused an increase in spontaneous motor activity. Alternatively, motor activity was depressed subsequent to high doses of phenobarbital and phenytoin. Remacemide was inactive against pentylenetetrazol and 'kindling' seizures. It was without effect in 5 electrophysiological tests (evoked responses, recurrent inhibition, long-term potentiation, penicillin-induced discharge rate and veratridine-induced depolarization) employing the in vitro hippocampal slice technique. Moreover, remacemide failed to demonstrate potent binding in vitro to neuronal L-glutamate, gamma-amino-butyrate A, adenosine A1, benzodiazepine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (strychnine-insensitive glycine and ion channel subsites) or muscarinic receptors. In conclusion, remacemide specifically prevents seizures elicited by MES, an action predicting utility in patients with generalized tonic/clonic convulsions.", 
    "42": "Effects of drugs which enhance or reduce GABAergic neurotransmission upon conflict behavior were evaluated with a modified Vogel procedure which was shown to be insensitive to variations in motivation to drink and to the analgesic effects of morphine. In addition, the effects of these drugs on ambulatory activity and motor execution were quantified. For comparison, the benzodiazepines diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were used. Anticonflict actions of diazepam were obtained with a shock current of 0.25 mA but not with 0.05 or 0.5 mA, whereas the proconflict effect of FG7142 was obtained with 0.05 mA but not with higher currents. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide had anxiolytic effect in a dose similar to that required to reduce ambulatory activity, but below that needed to affect motor execution. At doses high enough to impair motor execution, anticonflict effects were considerable. The GABA-A receptor agonist THIP and the GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen lacked effect on conflict behavior in moderate doses, which reduced ambulatory activity. In doses which produced motor deficiencies these drugs reduced licking both in the conflict test and when tested without shock administration. The effects of the GABA transaminase inhibitors gamma-acetylene GABA and sodium valproate were similar to those of the receptor agonists. The GABA reuptake inhibitor SKF 100330A produced anticonflict effect in a dose below that needed to reduce ambulatory activity, but lacked effect on conflict behavior in higher doses. The GABA antagonist picrotoxin, and the GABA synthesis inhibitors 4-deoxypyridoxine and isoniazide, reduced licking both in the absence and presence of shock, and affected motor functions in the same doses. Bicuculline, at the doses used, had no behavioral effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The development of drug discrimination was assessed in rhesus monkeys using the conditioned taste-aversion paradigm. Monkeys were initially trained to respond under a fixed-ratio 30-response schedule of food-pellet delivery to assess the rate-decreasing effects of alprazolam (0.03 to 3 mg/kg, i.m., 60 min presession). Alprazolam decreased responding at doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg. Discriminative stimulus effects of alprazolam were then assessed by giving 0.03 mg/kg before sessions in which 1.8 mEq/kg lithium chloride was given immediately after the session (alprazolam/lithium session). On intervening days, saline was given before and after the session (saline/saline session). Rates of responding decreased over successive alprazolam/lithium sessions and also during the saline/saline session that immediately followed an alprazolam/lithium session. During subsequent saline/saline sessions, rates of responding returned to levels near baseline rates within two to four sessions. The discriminative stimulus effects of alprazolam were then assessed by giving 0.1 mg/kg before sessions in which 1 mg/kg d-amphetamine was given immediately after the session (alprazolam/d-amphetamine session). Rates of responding decreased during subsequent alprazolam/d-amphetamine sessions in drug-experienced monkeys, but did not decrease during intervening saline/saline sessions. These findings demonstrate that drug stimuli associated with postsession drug injections can rapidly develop control over behavior and suggest that similar methods be explored in the assessment of drug discrimination.", 
    "44": "This is a report of the results of 25 experiments in five rats investigating the dose-response relationship for the antinociceptive effects of chlordiazepoxide given intrathecally in the dose range 0.03-0.9 mumol and a further 40 experiments in eight rats investigating the actions of flumazenil and naloxone on this effect. Electrical-current thresholds for pain were measured in the skin of the tail and neck of rats with previously implanted lumbar subarachnoid catheters. Intrathecal chlordiazepoxide produced spinally mediated antinociception, i.e. rises in the current threshold for pain in the tail without a significant change in the neck. This antinociceptive effect was dose dependent. Flumazenil 16.5 mumol kg-1 i.p. reduced the response caused by chlordiazepoxide 0.6 mumol by 78 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM). By contrast, the same dose of flumazenil did not significantly affect the antinociceptive effect of an equipotent dose of intrathecal fentanyl 0.74 nmol. Naloxone 0.38 mumol kg-1 i.p. abolished the spinally mediated antinociception caused by fentanyl (96 +/- 7% suppression) but did not significantly reduce the effect of chlordiazepoxide (27 +/- 13% suppression). However, a higher dose of naloxone (6.1 mumol kg-1 i.p.) caused significant partial suppression (79 +/- 10.7%) of chlordiazepoxide spinal antinociception. We conclude that chlordiazepoxide produces an antinociceptive effect by combination with benzodiazepine receptors in the spinal cord.", 
    "45": "Experiments using measurement of electrical-current threshold as a nociceptive test in the skin of the tail and neck in rats demonstrated that fentanyl, ketocyclazocine and midazolam caused spinally mediated antinociception when the drugs were administered intrathecally via chronically implanted lumbar subarachnoid catheters. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil selectively suppressed the midazolam response, indicating that this benzodiazepine exerted its segmental antinociceptive effect via spinal-cord benzodiazepine receptors. Naloxone blocked the responses to both opioids and also midazolam. The dose of naloxone which suppressed the midazolam response was similar to that required to suppress the response to the kappa-opioid agonist. We suggest that the segmental antinociceptive effects of fentanyl and midazolam are mediated via different pathways; the benzodiazepine exerts its antinociceptive action via a spinal-cord opioid pathway which does not involve mu-receptors.", 
    "46": "Peptides DBI 42-50 (DRPGLLDLK) and DBI 43-50 (RPGLLDLK) are synthetic fragments of an 18 amino acid peptide called octadecaneuropeptide (QATVGDVNTDRPGLLDLK), a brain derivative of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI). The two peptides were unilaterally injected into the dorsal hippocampus (granule cells of dentate gyrus) of freely moving adult rats. The electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern was continuously recorded from bilateral hippocampal and cortical electrodes, and the animals' behavior was observed throughout the experiment. A dose of 100 nmol peptide 42-50 was required to reliably cause EEG alterations (seizures and spiking). EEG changes, defined as seizures, were characterized by discrete repetitive periods of high-frequency and/or multispike complexes and/or high-voltage synchronized spike or wave activity. EEG seizures were often associated with a frozen appearance of the animal and \"wet dog shakes.\" Tonic-clonic convulsions were not observed. EEG seizures induced by peptide 42-50 were prevented by 90 mg/kg PK 11195, a selective antagonist of a novel GABAA receptor-linked subtype of a benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor, but were unaffected by flumazenil, an agonist of the \"central\" type of BDZ receptor and by D(-)2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, a selective antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptors. Light microscopy showed no neuropathological changes in the injected hippocampus. The data show that these DBI-derived peptide fragments induce a typical pattern of limbic seizures in rats. DBI and/or its natural processing products may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy.", 
    "47": "A recent consensus statement from the American Psychiatric Association emphasized that plasma elimination half-life should not be confused with duration of action and labeled use of short half-life, high-potency benzodiazepines as a risk factor for chronic toxicity, cognitive impairment, true physiologic dependence, and discontinuance symptoms. Instead, other factors such as lipid solubility (lipophilicity), brain clearance rate, redistribution rate, receptor kinetics, and tolerance are currently thought to be additional important determinants of the pharmacodynamic profile of benzodiazepines. In in vitro experiments, quazepam and its first metabolite, 2-oxoquazepam, were found to have high lipophilicity, a finding that could have important clinical implications.", 
    "48": "Benzodiazepine receptor binding and open-field response were examined in male CD-1 mice after 6 weeks on a liquid diet providing either 36% ethanol or maltose-dextrin derived calories. In vivo binding of [3H]Ro15-1788, open-field activity and cortex and plasma concentrations were measured over a range of clonazepam doses (0.05-2.0 mg/kg). Mean +/- S.D. of ethanol consumption was 19.3 +/- 1.1 g/kg/day. Clonazepam concentration in plasma and cortex was related linearly to dose in both groups. Cortex concentrations exceeded plasma concentrations at all doses. Ethanol-consuming mice showed considerably less decrease in measures of horizontal and stereotypic activity at each dose studied. Mean in vivo IC50 was 20.9 +/- 4.0 ng/g for the control mice and 40.2 +/- 7.6 ng/g (P less than .001) in the ethanol-consuming mice. In vitro binding studies found a marked decrease in maximum binding in cortex (37%) with an increase in Kd (66%). Chronic ethanol can influence the acute effects of single doses of clonazepam and both in vivo and in vitro measures of benzodiazepine receptor binding.", 
    "49": "Iodine-123-labeled Ro 16-0154 is a high affinity, reversibly binding radiotracer for the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor. Brain uptake of this radioligand was relatively stable and showed high ratios of specific-to-nonspecific uptake, with greater than 90% displaced by intravenous administration of BZ receptor agents. Repeated injections of increasing doses of each of five BZ drugs (Ro 16-0154, Ro 15-1788, clonazepam, alprazolam, and diazepam) yielded stepwise displacement curves, which were analyzed to measure the in vivo potencies of these agents. The relatively long half-life of 123I and the stable biologic uptake of the radiotracer allowed such potency estimations in just one experiment following a single injection of radioligand. The in vivo potencies of these five agents were highly correlated with their affinities for the BZ receptor determined with in vitro homogenate binding. A single crystal probe provided potency measurements virtually identical to simultaneously performed SPECT imaging studies. In conclusion, stepwise displacement by agents administered following the injection of the radioligand 123I-Ro 16-0154 provided a reliable means of measuring the in vivo potencies of BZ receptor agents. This in vivo determination may predict the clinical potency of BZ drugs than in vitro homogenate estimations, because the in vivo measure provides the summed effects of receptor affinity, plasma protein binding, penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and metabolism of the displacing agent.", 
    "50": "The in vivo kinetic behavior of [11C]flumazenil ([11C]FMZ), a non-subtype-specific central benzodiazepine antagonist, is characterized using compartmental analysis with the aim of producing an optimized data acquisition protocol and tracer kinetic model configuration for the assessment of [11C]FMZ binding to benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) in human brain. The approach presented is simple, requiring only a single radioligand injection. Dynamic positron emission tomography data were acquired on 18 normal volunteers using a 60- to 90-min sequence of scans and were analyzed with model configurations that included a three-compartment, four-parameter model, a three-compartment, three-parameter model, with a fixed value for free plus nonspecific binding; and a two-compartment, two-parameter model. Statistical analysis indicated that a four-parameter model did not yield significantly better fits than a three-parameter model. Goodness of fit was improved for three- versus two-parameter configurations in regions with low receptor density, but not in regions with moderate to high receptor density. Thus, a two-compartment, two-parameter configuration was found to adequately describe the kinetic behavior of [11C]FMZ in human brain, with stable estimates of the model parameters obtainable from as little as 20-30 min of data. Pixel-by-pixel analysis yields functional images of transport rate (K1) and ligand distribution volume (DV\"), and thus provides independent estimates of ligand delivery and BZR binding.", 
    "51": "A recognition site for benzodiazepines structurally different from that linked to various gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor subtypes is located on the outer mitochondrial membranes of steroidogenic cells. This protein has been signified to be important in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. Because of its location it is designated herein as the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). A putative endogenous ligand for MBR is the peptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), previously shown to displace drugs from MBR and to be expressed and stored in steroidogenic cells rich in MBR. The two model systems used to study steroidogenic regulation by DBI were the Y-1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig cell lines previously shown to be applicable in studies of mitochondrial steroidogenesis. Both cell lines contain DBI as well as DBI processing products, including the DBI fragments that on reverse phase HPLC coelute with the naturally occurring triakontatetraneuropeptide [TTN; DBI-(17-50)] and octadecaneuropeptide [DBI-(33-50)]. When DBI purified from rat brain was added to mitochondria prepared from Y-1 and MA-10 cell lines, it increased the rates of pregnenolone formation in a dose-related manner. In both cell lines, maximal stimulation (3-fold) of mitochondrial steroidogenesis was obtained with 0.33 microM DBI, with an EC50 of approximately 0.1 microM. However, DBI concentrations higher than 1 microM caused a smaller increase in pregnenolone formation. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine that binds with high nanomolar affinity to MBR, was recently shown to act as an antagonist of ACTH and LH/hCG-induced steroidogenesis and was found in the present studies to inhibit DBI-stimulated mitochondrial steroidogenesis. During the incubation with mitochondria, DBI was partially processed to different peptide fragments, including octadecaneuropeptide and TTN. To determine whether DBI processing products influence mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis, several DBI fragments and other peptides structurally unrelated to DBI were tested. Among these, only TTN stimulated mitochondrial steroid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner similar to DBI.", 
    "52": "Two benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists (Ro 15-4513, Ro 15-3505) and one benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist (flumazenil) were administered to rats with hepatic encephalopathy due to acute liver ischemia. Significant improvement (P less than 0.002) of both the clinical grade of hepatic encephalopathy and the electroencephalographic abnormalities was observed after administration of the benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists: comatose rats with no spontaneous righting reflex regained consciousness immediately after injection of the drug. Only slight improvement in clinical hepatic encephalopathy grade was seen after administration of 25 mg/kg of flumazenil. The present data strongly support a role of increased gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic tone in the pathogenesis of acute hepatic encephalopathy and provide a rationale for trials of benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists to restore consciousness in hepatic encephalopathy in humans in the near future.", 
    "53": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled EEG-brain-mapping study Saletu et al. demonstrated the encephalotropic effects of single doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg D,L-kawain in healthy volunteers. The substance induced a dose-dependent increase in delta, theta and alpha 1 power, as well as a decrease in alpha 2 and beta power. The shift towards low frequences indicated a sedative effect of higher doses of D,L-kawain. Changes were most pronounced in the frontal regions. The pharmacodynamic peak was reached in the 1st hour; a 2nd peak was seen in the 8th hour. D,L-kawain at a dose of 200 mg had an initial activating effect, followed at a later stage by a mild sedative effect. Self-rating scales suggested activation after 200 mg, but mild sedation after 600 mg. Psychometric performance improved after all D,L-kawain doses; there were no adverse reactions.", 
    "54": "In this study the effects of muscarinic antagonists and agonists on M1 muscarinic receptors in the isolated rat superior cervical ganglion and the rat hippocampal slice were investigated. Oxotremorine and APE but not pilocarpine, McN-A-343 or 4-Cl-McN-A-343 induced small M2 muscarinic receptor-mediated hyperpolarizations in the rat superior cervical ganglion. Nevertheless, for all the agonists investigated the pA2 values of the muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol indicated the presence of only M1 muscarinic receptors in the rat superior cervical ganglion and hippocampal slice. Full agonistic behaviour with respect to depolarization of the rat superior cervical ganglion was observed for pilocarpine, McN-A-343 and 4-Cl-McN-A-343. Oxotremorine and arecaidine propargyl ester were partial agonists in this preparation, with maximal effects of 35 and 46% of the maximum obtained with pilocarpine, respectively. Pilocarpine, oxotremorine and arecaidin propargyl ester displayed full agonistic behaviour on the increase in firing rate of pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices. Whereas 4-Cl-McN-A-343 was a partial agonist (maximal effect of 63% of the maximum obtained with pilocarpine), McN-A-343 displayed no agonistic or antagonistic activity in rat hippocampal slices. It remains to be established whether the heterogeneous behaviour of the agonists in both preparations reflects as yet unknown differences in the M1 receptor protein or results from differences in the coupling of receptor to second messenger.", 
    "55": "The affinity and selectivity of racemic terodiline (N-tert-butyl-1-methyl-3,3-diphenylpropylamine HCl) for muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined from functional responses of rabbit vas deferens (M1), guinea pig atria (M2) and bladder detrusor muscle (M3). (+/-)-Terodiline was found to be about as potent as pirenzepine in the rabbit vas deferens (Kb = 15 and 31 nM, respectively) and at least as selective for M1 relative to M2 (11-fold) and M3 (19-fold) receptors. Like pirenzepine, (+/-)-terodiline does not distinguish between M2 and M3 receptors in vitro. The peripheral actions of (+/-)-terodiline were evaluated in vivo in terms of its ability to induce mydriasis, and to inhibit salivary secretion and urinary bladder contraction. (+/-)-Terodiline given s.c. was equipotent in inhibiting intravesical bladder pressure and carbachol-induced salivary secretion (ID50 = 24 and 35 mg/kg, respectively), and in increasing pupil diameter (ED50 = 59 mg/kg). These results suggest that the in vivo actions of racemic terodiline at (M3) receptors mediating bladder contraction may not be separable from its actions at receptors mediating mydriasis and salivation. Moreover, its effects on the pupil and salivary glands are apparently not mediated through M1 receptors. Together, these findings help clarify the action of (+/-)-terodiline in the treatment of neurogenic bladder.", 
    "56": "The effect of i.p. or i.v. administration of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepin e.HCl, molecular weight 330) and NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)-quinoxaline, molecular weight 342) on sound-induced seizures in rats and photically induced myoclonus in baboons was studied. In both species an anticonvulsant effect occurred 15-60 min after administration of GYKI 52466 or NBQX. The ED50 value for clonic seizure suppression for GYKI 52466 at 30 min was 39 (rats, i.p.) and at 15 min was 13 (Papio papio, i.v.) mumol kg-1 and for NBQX at 30 min was 40 (rats, i.p.) and at 15 min approximately 10 (Papio papio, i.v.) mumol kg-1. Side effects were not observed in rats; apparent side effects in baboons probably arose from drug formulation. The anticonvulsant actions of GYKI 52466 and NBQX suggest a possible role for non-NMDA antagonists in the therapy of epilepsy.", 
    "57": "A rapid and sensitive method for extracting temazepam from human serum and urine is presented. Free temazepam is extracted from plasma and urine samples using n-butyl chloride with nitrazepam as the internal standard. Temazepam glucuronide is analyzed as free temazepam after incubating extracts with beta-glucuronidase. Separation is achieved using a C8 reversed-phase column with a methanol-water-phosphate buffer mobile phase. An ultraviolet detector operated at 230 nm is used and a linear response is observed from 20 ng/ml to 10 micrograms/ml. The limit of detection is 15.5 ng/ml and the limit of quantitation is 46.5 ng/ml. Coefficients of variation are less than 10% for concentrations greater than 50 ng/ml. Application of the methodology is demonstrated in a pharmacokinetic study using eight healthy male subjects.", 
    "58": "The effects of psychological stress on catecholamine and indoleamine metabolism were examined in various brain regions of rats. Psychologically stressed rats were exposed to emotional responses of foot-shocked rats, but were themselves prevented from receiving foot-shock. Psychological stress for 30 min resulted in significant increases of both 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), but not in other dopamine (DA) terminal fields. The levels of noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were unaffected in all brain regions examined after 30 min of psychological stress. A small but significant increase of DOPAC levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) was observed after a shorter (10 min) duration of stress. Moreover, an increase of DOPAC levels in the MPFC 30 min after psychological stress was attenuated by diazepam (5 mg/kg), and this attenuating effect was antagonized by Ro 15-1788 (15 mg/kg). These results suggest that mesoprefrontal DA neurons are selectively activated by psychological stress, and that the activation of the A10 cell body site (VTA) may precede that of the terminal field (MPFC). Moreover, diazepam was found to possess an inhibitory effect on the activation of mesoprefrontal DA neurons induced by psychological stress, and this effect may be partly mediated by benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors and implicated in the specific anxiolytic action of BZDs.", 
    "59": "Electrophysiological recordings of responses to muscarinic receptor stimulation in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons have been largely unsuccessful to date. In this study muscarinic receptor binding was demonstrated in 2-week-old embryonic rat hippocampal cultures. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording we found that 1-5 microM carbachol produced multiple effects including depolarization, increased action potential firing rate, increased synaptic activity and a reduction in the amplitude of medium-duration afterhyperpolarizations. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed a time-dependent current relaxation with hyperpolarizing steps from a holding potential of about -40 mV which was inhibited by 10 microM muscarine or 50 microM carbachol and had characteristics similar to those of the m-current. Both atropine and pirenzepine inhibited all of these effects indicating that these cholinergic actions were mediated by muscarinic receptors. This study shows that muscarinic responses obtained classically in hippocampal brain slices can also be produced in cultured hippocampus.", 
    "60": "An analytical method employing reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography is described for the determination of a potential anxiolytic agent in human plasma. This experimental drug candidate has potent and selective affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor complex. The compound and internal standard are extracted from buffered plasma (pH 9.0) into ethyl acetate. The solvent is evaporated and the residue is reconstituted in chromatographic mobile phase. Separation is achieved on a 5-microns phenyl column with ultraviolet absorbance detection of the drug and internal standard at 270 nm. Recovery and reproducibility assessments indicate good accuracy (overall relative recovery of 101%) and precision (coefficients of variation from 2.0 to 11%) over the concentration range 10-1000 ng/ml. The limit of quantification for the method is 10 ng/ml. The method is suitable for pharmacokinetic analysis following the administration of 80 mg of drug to normal volunteers.", 
    "61": "The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity were examined using cultured rat cortical neurons. Brief exposure of glutamate followed by an incubation with normal solution for more than 60 min reduced cell viability by 60-70%, compared with control values. Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity was significantly inhibited by MK-801 and ketamine, which are non-competitive blockers of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Octapeptide CCK-8S and CCK-related decapeptide ceruletide at concentrations of 10(-9)-10(-7) M dose-dependently reduced glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. A desulfated analog CCK-8NS, which acts selectively as an antagonist of CCKB receptors, also reduced glutamate neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of CCK were antagonized by L-365260, a CCKB receptor antagonist, but not by L-364718, a CCKA receptor antagonist. These results suggest that CCK protects cortical neurons against NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate neurotoxicity via CCKB receptors.", 
    "62": "The central type benzodiazepine receptor (BDZr), an allosteric modulatory site of the GABAA receptor-anion channel, has been shown in vitro to respond to drugs with positive efficacy (agonists), zero efficacy (competitive antagonists) and drugs with negative efficacy (inverse agonists). However, this general concept of the function of BDZr drugs has rarely been assessed in intact living brain. We report here in on a non-invasive in vivo assessment of the intrinsic efficacies of BDZr drugs in the brain of non-human primates. We have performed an in vivo simultaneous determination of fractional BDZr occupancy and the resulting pharmacological efficacies of the full agonist diazepam, the partial agonist bretazenil, the antagonist flumazenil (Ro15-1788), the partial inverse agonist Ro15-4513 and the full inverse agonist methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM). Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to estimate fractional BDZr occupancy measured as the in vivo displacement in the brain of the positron emitter radioligand, [11C]flumazenil. Simultaneously, the proconvulsant or anticonvulsant efficacies of the BDZr drugs were measured as their abilities to facilitate or counteract the central effects of an infusion of pentylenetetrazol, a non-competitive GABA antagonist acting on the picrotoxin site of the receptor complex. This was measured using electroencephalographic recording (EEG). Our results show that, in vivo, the fractional receptor occupancy by a given drug is perfectly correlated with its resulting graded pharmacological effects, as predicted from the competitive drug receptor interaction theory. Furthermore, the slope of the relationship between fractional receptor occupancies and the resulting pharmacological effects (an index of intrinsic efficacy) strictly depends on the BDZr ligand considered. Diazepam displayed a strong positive intrinsic efficacy, and, in contrast, beta-CCM a marked negative one. Between these two extremes, the partially active drugs bretazenil and Ro15-4513, which required a large fractional receptor occupancy to produce significant anti- or proconvulsant effects, respectively, displayed only a weak intrinsic efficacy. Flumazenil did not produce any significant pharmacological effect. We observed that the in vivo intrinsic efficacies of diazepam, flumazenil and beta-CCM correlate with their intrinsic efficacies as measured by their modulatory effects on the GABA-dependent membrane chloride conductance in vitro. Thus, the intrinsic efficacies measured using PET and EEG are likely to reflect the different in vivo abilities of BDZr drugs to induce or stabilize the GABAA-benzodiazepine chloride channel in a given conformation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Diazepam metabolism has been investigated in rat hepatocytes cultured for 3, 24, 48 and 72 hr under five different conditions. Although four of the treatments studied reduced markedly the spontaneous loss of cytochrome P450, they had different effects on the metabolism of diazepam (DZ) presumably by affecting the relative proportions of cytochrome P450 isozymes during the period of culture. Thus P450 medium or dimethyl sulphoxide-supplemented medium maintained the rate of disappearance of DZ from the culture medium and metabolite profile in 24 hr cultures at the initial levels found in 3 hr cultures, while culture at 30 degrees or in metyrapone-containing medium resulted in the production of oxazepam, a metabolite normally only produced by dog, monkey and human hepatocytes. These findings indicate that the well recognized phenotypic alteration of cytochrome P450-dependent mono-oxygenase activities that occurs when rat hepatocytes are cultured in different media can result in a range of metabolic options that are normally only available in other animal species.", 
    "64": "The transfectivity of anthramycin (Atm)-modified phi X174 replicative form (RF) DNA in Escherichia coli is lower in uvrA and uvrB mutant cells but much higher in uvrC mutant cells compared to wild-type cells. Pretreatment of the Atm-modified phage DNA with purified UVRA and UVRB significantly increases the transfectivity of the DNA in uvrA or uvrB mutant cells. This pretreatment greatly reduces the UVRABC nuclease-sensitive sites (UNSS) and Atm-induced absorbance at 343 nm in the Atm-modified DNA without producing apurinic sites. The reduction of UNSS is proportional to the concentrations of UVRA and UVRB and the enzyme-DNA incubation time and requires ATP. We conclude that there are two different mechanisms for repairing Atm-N2 guanine adducts by UVR proteins: (1) UVRA and UVRB bind to the Atm-N2 guanine double-stranded DNA region and consequently release the Atm from the adducted guanine; (2) UVRABC makes an incision at both sides of the Atm-DNA adduct. The latter mechanism produces potentially lethal double-strand DNA breaks in Atm-modified phi X174 RF DNA in vitro.", 
    "65": "Tacrine (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-acridinamine) inhibited binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptors of guinea pig hippocampus with an inhibition constant of 46 microM at 2 degrees C and 37 degrees C. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) decreased the affinity of tacrine for the receptor, suggesting that tacrine may act as an inverse agonist. A Hill coefficient less than 1 was observed under all conditions. Allosteric interactions may explain this behaviour, since 100 microM tacrine increased the rate of dissociation of [3H]flunitrazepam from the receptor. Tacrine inhibited the binding of 11 nM [3H]GABA to GABA receptors of guinea pig cerebral cortex with I50 = 188 microM. Bicuculline methiodide was 4 times as potent (I50 = 49 microM). The interaction of tacrine with GABA or benzodiazepine binding sites is unlikely to be of clinical significance.", 
    "66": "GABAA receptors purified from the brains of 5- to 10-day-old rats were completely N- and O-deglycosylated using N-glycanase and/or neuraminidase plus O-glycanase. Intact or completely deglycosylated receptors were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Polyclonal antibodies directed against synthetic aminoacid sequences specific for the GABAA receptor alpha 1-, alpha 2- or alpha 3-subunits each identified an apparently single protein of about 51 kDa, 53 kDa or 59 kDa, respectively, in the intact receptors. In the deglycosylated receptors, however, three different proteins were identified by antibodies directed against the alpha 3-subunit and at least two different proteins were identified by antibodies directed against the alpha 2- or alpha 1-subunit.", 
    "67": "The corneal reflex and the three components of the blink reflex (R1, R2, and R3) were recorded electromyographically in volunteers. The area of these responses was measured before and after administration of the narcotic-analgesic fentanyl (1.5 mg i.m.) and its antagonist naloxone, and after administration of the benzodiazepine diazepam (10 mg i.v.) and its antagonist flumazenil. Saline was given as a control placebo. The corneal reflex was 71% reduced by fentanyl, 43% by diazepam. R1 was 35% reduced and R2 was 60% reduced by diazepam. R3 was abolished by both drugs. Whereas the fentanyl-induced changes were completely reversed by naloxone, the diazepam-induced changes were only partly reversed by flumazenil. The corneal reflex appears to be a 'nociceptive' reflex under all points of view. Recording of the orbicularis oculi reflexes in man may be valuable in the evaluation of central-acting neurotropic drugs.", 
    "68": "Increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. The mechanism by which GABA-ergic activity is increased in hepatic failure is unclear, but recent studies in animals with encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure suggest that GABA-ergic neurotransmission may be increased by the presence of elevated concentrations of benzodiazepine agonists such as diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "69": "Samples of frontal cortex were obtained at autopsy from 11 patients with hepatic encephalopathy who died of acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients who died of cardiovascular disease or trauma. None of the 19 patients had received benzodiazepines while hospitalized. Chromatographic analyses of extracts of these samples revealed 4 to 19 peaks representing substances that inhibited the binding of a radiolabeled imidazobenzodiazepine ([3H]flumazenil) to its receptors. Several of these peaks had retention times corresponding to those of known 1,4-benzodiazepines. Ultraviolet- and mass-spectroscopic analysis confirmed that two of these peaks represented diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. The patients who died of fulminant hepatic failure could be divided into two groups: six who had had significantly elevated brain concentrations (2-fold to 10-fold higher than normal) of substances inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil and five who had normal concentrations.", 
    "70": "Brain concentrations of substances inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil to its receptors are increased in some patients with hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure. The origin of these substances is unknown, but these findings provide a rational basis for trials of benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists in the management of this disorder.", 
    "71": "Diazepam lowered homovanillic acid levels in brain regions from untreated and haloperidol-treated rats. However, there was evidence of a biphasic effect in that 2 mg/kg was more effective than 10 mg/kg under several conditions. Diazepam was more effective in restoring regional HVA toward control levels following doses of haloperidol in the low clinical range (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg) than following higher doses. With respect to maximizing dopamine receptor blockade and minimizing compensatory presynaptic activity in the acute treatment of psychotic conditions, our data provide some support for the use of modest doses of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines."
