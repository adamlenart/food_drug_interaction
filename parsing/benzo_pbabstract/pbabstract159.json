Severity of somatic symptoms assessed by EPEP significantly decreased (p<0.0001) from 7.68 in the pre-treatment assessment to 2.28 at 3 months post-treatment. Mirtazapine modifies attribution of somatic symptoms in somatizers: in pretreatment assessment, 41.3 % of the sample attributed somatic symptoms to a psychological origin, while at 3 months post-treatment this percentage significantly increased (p<0.05) to 63.94%. Nearly half of the sample (48.52%) took benzodiazepines at the start of the study; but at 3 months post-treatment only 6.71% of the patients needed them.

    "13": "As expected, at presentation with depression, the subjects' current illness severity was the major determinant of performance, as opposed to the intensity of their previous depressive history (the number and length of past episodes). However, following clinical response at the second visit, the length of previous depressive history became more significant than current symptoms. The following factors had significant, independent impact: age, education level, and profession.", 
    "14": "Previous studies of small samples assessed for memory function, more or less specific to the hippocampus, have shown great variability in age, gender, education level, and the length and intensity of depressive episode. Hence, a very large sample was required to disentangle the central effect of previous depressive history. As demonstrated in a general practice sample in this study, the hypothesis that the length of past depression impairs memory performance is supported, suggesting that there is a toxic link between the burden of depression and cognition. This finding has important implications for public health.",

The stoichiometry of the complexes was determined by Scott's method to be 1:1, and the association constant (K(a)) was calculated to be 108 M(-1). It was confirmed on the basis of 2D ROESY spectral data that only a fluorine-substituted aromatic ring acted as guest in complexation. Most of the aromatic signals of MDL exhibited induced shift changes as well as splitting, in the presence of beta-CD, indicating chiral differentiation of MDL by beta-CD.", 
    "16": "A sample included 61 patients, 53 men and 8 women, with ICD-10 episodic schizophrenia in the remission after treatment with atypical neuroleptics (risperidon, olanzapine, clozapine). All patients were featured by therapeutically caused excess of body mass (obesity of different degrees) that hampered the further treatment. In 31 cases (the main group) atypical neuroleptics were substituted for traditional drugs that exerted lesser influence on body mass. Haloperidol (mean dosage 4,1 mg daily) was administered to 17 patients and trifluoperazine (mean dosage 7,1 mg daily) to 14 patients. Other 30 patients (a control group) continued to receive atypical neuroleptics. Between group differences of patient's mental and somatic state were assessed using quantitative scales. It was shown that the substitution of atypical neuroleptics for traditional neuroleptic drugs allowed to stop further body mass gain and even decreased it without significant influence on psychopathological symptoms and other side-effects in patients with excess of body mass.", 
    "17": "The study aimed at investigating of efficacy of hydroxyzine (atarax) as a substitutive drug used in case of benzodiazepine tranquilizers (BDT) withdrawal in patients who received BDT for more than 3 months. Fifty-nine patients with protracted chronic anxiety-phobic disorders were divided into 2 groups: in the first (main) one, BDT were withdrawn at once with the following assignment of substitutive therapy with atarax and in the second (control) group the withdrawal was continuous during 14 days with the simultaneous assignment of a substitutive placebo therapy. In the first group (resumed the BDT therapy because of worsening of their state 23,3% patients finished their participation in the study ahead of time as compared to 65,6% of those in the control group. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores were more reduced in the main group than in the control one. The results obtained suggest that atarax is worth to be used as a substitutive drug for BDT.",

In 23 cases (main group), a combined therapy with somatotropic and psychotropic drugs was used while 13 patients were (control group) treated only with somatotropic medications. Citalopram, a selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, was the main psychopharmacological drug used in the treatment of the main group. In some cases other medications (neuroleptics, benzodiazepines) were used. Patient's state was assessed by the results of the somatic and psychopathological examination using psychometric scales and by a number of indices obtained in the instrumental and laboratory (biochemical etc) study. The results suggest the higher efficacy of the combined therapy by all parameters--arterial pressure, indices of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, severity of affective disorders.",

Specific sources of prescription drug coverage were not significantly associated with benzodiazepine use. Female gender, chronic mental illness, age under 65, and lower income were significantly positively associated with benzodiazepine use in the Medicare population, whereas black and other races were significantly negatively associated with benzodiazepine use in this population. Compared with Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental drug coverage, beneficiaries with supplemental drug coverage were more likely to use potential benzodiazepine substitute classes than benzodiazepines.",

    "25": "AMPA receptors mediate the majority of fast synaptic transmission and underlie several forms of synaptic plasticity. AMPARs also have an important role in several neuronal pathologies. Therefore, studying the structure and function of these receptors is important for understanding general mechanisms of synaptic transmission as well as for the development of new therapies. A recent study identified the apparent binding sites for GYKI 53655 (GYKI) and CP-465,022 (CP) at the interface between the glutamate binding core and the transmembrane domains. The emerging role of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) in AMPAR function raises the possibility that the antagonism of these receptors is also affected by TARPs such as stargazin. Here we compare the antagonism of the competitive antagonist CNQX and the negative allosteric modulators GYKI, and CP in the absence and presence of stargazin. We found that stargazin decreases the apparent affinity of GluR1 for CNQX, which is most likely explained by a partial agonistic effect of CNQX. In contrast, stargazin increases the affinity for GYKI, and has only a small effect on CP binding. Because inhibition of recently described GYKI insensitive receptors is restored by co-expression with stargazin, our data suggest that the identified residues do not constitute the full GYKI binding site. We could show that the ectodomain of stargazin controls the change in agonist sensitivity. Mutations in the identified binding regions for GYKI and CP dramatically reduced surface expression. Our data provides further evidence that TARPs alter the conformation of pore-forming subunits and thereby affects antagonist interaction.", 
    "26": "The mechanisms underlying olanzapine-induced weight gain have not yet been fully elucidated. To examine the effects of long-term treatment with olanzapine on different aspects of energy balance, we administered olanzapine to male rats. Osmotic minipumps were chosen as preferred mode of administration because the half-life of olanzapine is only 2(1/2) h in rats compared to 30 h in humans. We discovered that, within one week, degradation of olanzapine occurred in the solution used to fill the minipump reservoir. This resulted in a decrease in delivered olanzapine and declining plasma levels over the course of the experiment. Therefore, we caution other researchers for the limitations of using osmotic minipumps to administer olanzapine for longer periods of time.", 
    "27": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a condition that is common in the general population and in general practice; it is disabling and often unrecognized. Its recognition is difficult because of the need to differentiate between normal anxiety and the other psychiatric disorders with which it is often associated. The primary drugs used for GAD are the antidepressants that have been authorized for this indication (venlafaxine XR, paroxetine, and escitalopram). Although benzodiazepines are effective, their prescription is limited by the disadvantages associated with their long-term use. Drug treatment of GAD must continue for a sufficiently long period (at least 6 months) to minimize the chance of a relapse. Cognitive and behavioral therapies (CBT) are as effective as antidepressants. They are often desirable, but their limited availability impedes their use as a first-line treatment.", 
    "28": "The effects of long-term low-dose hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the level of hormone in plasma and on the binding capacity of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) on the platelet membranes were investigated among women. This study was a retrospective and case-controlled study where 64 women using long-term low-dose HRT for over 4 years entered the study and 99 women, age and education matched, were enrolled as control. Plasma hormone level and platelet PBR binding capacity of two groups were analyzed. A significant increase in plasma estradiol level in women using HRT was observed, compared to those in the control group. Meanwhile, women in the HRT group displayed higher platelet PBR binding capacity. Further analysis demonstrated that the binding capacity of platelet PBR was closely related to estradiol plasma level in all subjects. These results suggest that long-term low-dose HRT could relieve the decrease of estradiol level in plasma and PBR binding capacity on platelets in postmenopausal women, alleviate the endocrine imbalance process, and might be beneficial for reducing the risks of some diseases.",

    "40": "There were no significant differences at baseline between medication-free individuals and those still using sleep medication at the end of a taper intervention. Group differences emerged midway through the 8-week withdrawal program and were accentuated after the intervention; participants who remained medication-free during the next six months had less severe insomnia and anxiety symptoms, a more positive perception of their health and higher self-efficacy to refrain from hypnotic use in various situations. Contrary to expectations, there were no differences between drug-free and nondrug-free participants on both readiness to change and stages of change.", 
    "41": "Chronic users of hypnotic medications entered a taper intervention with equal levels of psychological distress, health, self-efficacy, and readiness to change. Successful hypnotic discontinuation was associated with overall improvement of insomnia, anxiety and distress symptoms, perceived health and self-efficacy. More intensive and individualized therapeutic attention may be warranted for individuals experiencing worsening of insomnia symptoms, more withdrawal symptoms and psychological distress, and lower self-efficacy during medication discontinuation.", 
    "42": "Simple, accurate, precise, and sensitive ultraviolet spectrophotometric and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) methods for simultaneous estimation of escitalopram oxalate (ESC) and clonazepam (CLO) in combined tablet dosage form have been developed and validated. The spectroscopic method employs an absorbance correction method using 238.6 and 308 nm as 2 wavelengths for estimation with methanol and water as solvents. Beer's law is obeyed in the concentration range of 10.0-50.0 and 0.5-3.0 micro/mL for ESC and CLO, respectively. The RP-HPLC method uses a Jasco HPLC system with HiQ SiL C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm id) acetonitrile-0.005 M tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (55 + 45, v/v) as the mobile phase, and satranidazole as an internal standard. The detection was carried out using an ultraviolet detector set at 287 nm. For the HPLC method, Beer's law is obeyed in the concentration range of 10.0-60.0 and 0.5-3.0 microg/mL for ESC and CLO, respectively. Both methods have been successfully applied for the analysis of the drugs in a pharmaceutical formulation. Results of analysis were validated statistically and by recovery studies.",

    "45": "NPS (0.01-1 nmol per mouse) caused a significant increase in LA in naive mice, in mice habituated to the test cages and in animals sedated with diazepam (5 mg kg(-1)). In the RR assay, NPS dose dependently reduced the proportion of animals losing the RR in response to diazepam (15 mg kg(-1)) and their sleeping time. In the EPM and SIH test, NPS dose dependently evoked anxiolytic-like effects by increasing the time spent by animals in the open arms and reducing the SIH response, respectively.", 
    "46": "We provide further evidence that NPS acts as a novel modulator of arousal and anxiety-related behaviours by promoting a unique pattern of effects: stimulation associated with anxiolysis. Therefore, NPS receptor ligands may represent innovative drugs for the treatment of sleep and anxiety disorders.",

We present two cases where a choice had to be made as to whether to prescribe Olanzapine during pregnancy, with different results.", 
    "48": "Weight gain is a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, respiratory illnesses, various forms of cancer, and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity is common among psychiatric patients in general and among schizophrenia patients in particular. Antipsychotic treatment may contribute to obesity by increasing appetite. Weight gain may also be related to apathy regarding body enhancement, reduction of interest, and need for oral gratifications associated with psychiatric disorders.",

The control group included 30 patients who were treated with first generation antipsychotics. We compared weight prior to initiation of antipsychotic treatment and one year later, and demographic and medical data as recorded in the patients' medical files. Following one year of treatment 55% of the patients increased their weight, 2% remained at the same weight and 43% had lost weight.", 
    "51": "Our study showed that there are differences in the direction of weight changes among the patients: while most of the patients gain weight during treatment, some lose weight.

    "54": "All enteroclyses were successfully completed; there were no hospital admissions due to complications. In Group One (n=106), mean dose of diazepam was 12.7 mg. 25% had oxygen desaturation (n=25), and post-procedure vomiting without aspiration (n=1). 56% of outpatients completed phone surveys, and 68% recalled procedural discomfort. In Group Two (n=45), mean doses were 3.9 mg midazolam and 108 mcg fentanyl. 31% had desaturation (n=13), and post-procedure vomiting without aspiration (n=1). 87% had only a vague recall of the procedure or of any discomfort.",

    "56": "Anecdotal reports indicate that GHB produces subjective effects similar to those of ethanol. However, recent investigations comparing the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB to those of ethanol suggest that the subjective effects of these substances may differ considerably. To explore further potential differences between GHB and ethanol, 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a three-lever drug discrimination procedure to discriminate ethanol (1.0 g/kg, experiment 1; 1.5 g/kg, experiment 2) and GHB (300 mg/kg) from vehicle. Dose-response functions determined with both training compounds revealed a clear dissociation between the discriminative stimulus effects of these drugs. As expected, the GHB precursors gamma-butyrolactone and 1,4-butanediol produced full substitution for GHB. In addition, the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen substituted for GHB, whereas the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam and the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine engendered greater responding on the ethanol-lever. GHB's discriminative stimulus effects were blocked by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP-35348 but only partially blocked by the putative GHB receptor antagonist NCS 382. These findings are consistent with previous reports of GHB's discriminative stimulus effects in two-choice drug discrimination procedures and provide additional evidence that these effects are distinct from those of ethanol.", 
    "57": "Second-generation antipsychotic drugs were introduced over a decade ago for the treatment of schizophrenia; however, their purported clinical effectiveness compared with first-generation antipsychotic drugs is still debated. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotic drugs with that of a low dose of haloperidol, in first-episode schizophrenia.", 
    "58": "We did an open randomised controlled trial of haloperidol versus second-generation antipsychotic drugs in 50 sites, in 14 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18-40 years, and met diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. 498 patients were randomly assigned by a web-based online system to haloperidol (1-4 mg per day; n=103), amisulpride (200-800 mg per day; n=104), olanzapine (5-20 mg per day; n=105), quetiapine (200-750 mg per day; n=104), or ziprasidone (40-160 mg per day; n=82); follow-up was at 1 year. The primary outcome measure was all-cause treatment discontinuation. Patients and their treating physicians were not blinded to the assigned treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN68736636.",

Comparisons with haloperidol showed lower risks for any-cause discontinuation with amisulpride (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37, [95% CI 0.24-0.57]), olanzapine (HR 0.28 [0.18-0.43]), quetiapine (HR 0.52 [0.35-0.76]), and ziprasidone (HR 0.51 [0.32-0.81]).

Replacement of the (2-aryl)-ethynyl-moiety in 8-position with smaller less lipophilic substituents produced compounds inhibiting the binding of [3H]-LY354740 to rat mGluR2 with low nanomolar affinity and consistent functional effect at both mGluR2 and mGluR3. These compounds were able to reverse LY354740-mediated inhibition of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the rat dentate gyrus and in vivo activity could be demonstrated by reversal of the LY354740-induced hypoactivity in mice after oral administration.",

Weight and weight-related quality of life (using the IWQOL-Lite) were assessed at baseline, and weeks 8, 18 and 26. Random regression analysis across all time points using all available data was used to compare groups on changes in weight and IWQOL-Lite. Meaningful change from baseline was also assessed.",

ARI participants lost an average of 1.7% of baseline weight in comparison to a gain of 2.1% by SOC participants (p<0.0001) at 26 weeks. ARI participants experienced significantly greater increases in physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, and IWQOL-Lite total score. At 26 weeks, 20.7% of ARI participants experienced meaningful improvements in IWQOL-Lite score, versus 13.5% of SOC participants. A clinically meaningful change in weight was also associated with a meaningful change in quality of life (p<0.001). A potential limitation of this study was its funding by a pharmaceutical company.",

    "67": "For over 15 years, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), recently named translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) has been studied as a biomarker of reactive gliosis and inflammation associated with a variety of neuropathological conditions. Early studies documented that in the brain parenchyma, TSPO is exclusively localized in glial cells. Under normal physiological conditions, TSPO levels are low in the brain neuropil but they markedly increase at sites of brain injury and inflammation making it uniquely suited for assessing active gliosis. This research has generated significant efforts from multiple research groups throughout the world to apply TSPO as a marker of \"active\" brain pathology using in vivo imaging modalities such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in experimental animals and humans. Further, in the last few years, there has been an increased interest in understanding the molecular and cellular function(s) of TSPO in glial cells. The latest evidence suggests that TSPO may not only serve as a biomarker of active brain disease but also the use of TSPO-specific ligands may have therapeutic implications in brain injury and repair. This review presents an overview of the history and function of TSPO focusing on studies related to its use as a sensor of active brain disease in experimental animals and in human studies.", 
    "68": "The positive modulation of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) is presumably one of the main mechanisms by which several sedatives mediate their actions in the central nervous system. This modulation appears to depend on the presence of alpha and beta GABA(A)R subunits, whose distinct expression in dorsal and ventral hippocampus has been recently shown. Using population spike recordings from the CA1 area of dorsal (DHS) and ventral (VHS) hippocampal slices we compared the effects of seven sedative/anesthetic drugs (diazepam, midazolam, phenobarbital, propofol, pentobarbital, thiopental and alfaxalone) on the GABAergic recurrent inhibition (RI) between the two hippocampal poles. The strength and duration of RI was quantified by measuring an antidromic stimulation-induced suppression of the orthodromic population spike at varying inter-pulse intervals. All drugs enhanced RI in both DHS and VHS but high concentrations of barbiturates and alfaxalone prolonged RI considerably more compared to benzodiazepines or low doses of barbiturates and propofol. Furthermore, the drug-induced prolongation of RI was significantly greater in DHS than in VHS. Thus, RI was enhanced by thiopental (50 microM), alfaxalone (2.5 microM) and pentobarbital (50 microM) up to 150 ms, 150 ms and 270 ms respectively in DHS, and up to 70 ms, 100 ms and 150 ms respectively in VHS. In addition, under GABA(B) receptor blockade, thiopental (100 microM) and alfaxalone (10 microM) prolonged GABA(A)R-mediated RI significantly more in DH (up to 900 ms) than in VH (up to 430 ms and 600 ms respectively). This finding provides support to the notion of diversification of intrinsic organization along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Finally, an interesting link was revealed between the magnitude of drug-induced enhancement of RI and the reported sedative potency of the drugs used, suggesting that deep sedation and anesthesia may involve prolongation of GABAergic inhibition.", 
    "69": "Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormones (SPRTH) is a non-neoplastic form of inappropriate secretion of thyrotropin (TSH). The etiology of this hormonal resistance is linked to inactivating mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR-beta) gene. These mutations affect critical portions of the receptor's triiodothyronine (T3)-binding domain. Clinically, SPRTH is characterized by hyperthyroidism with goiter and absence of pituitary mass in the morphologic study. Laboratory data show an elevation of free T3 and free thyroxine concentrations without suppression of TSH, with normal molar subunit alpha/TSH ratio. At this time, there is no specific therapy for SPRHT. Beta blockers, such as atenolol, and benzodiazepines have been used as a symptomatic therapy. Among the drugs with the capacity for reducing TSH secretion are TR agonists, such as triiodothyroacetic acid, D-thyroxine, triiodothyropropionic acid, and L-T3.",

Diazepam was the drug chosen for this study for its therapeutic importance and wide use, and for being a prescription drug controlled by the National Health Surveillance Agency--ANVISA. The generation of residues of Diazepam from manufacture to distribution as well as the management and final destination of these residues was observed. The study started in an average-size city in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, called S\u00e3o Mateus. In Brazil, 27.6% of cities are medium-sized like S\u00e3o Mateus and count on the presence of a municipal health surveillance service linked to an environmental control service. The objectives of this qualitative study were to: identify the main types of residues of Diazepam; study the main causes for the generation of residues of Diazepam; study the main difficulties found in the management of solid residues by the different agents involved in this process; study the environmental/health legislation related to the subject as well as its application. The relationship between these activities and the organisms responsible for the inspection and control of these residues, mainly as refers to the enforcement of the existent regulations, were also subject of this study.", 
    "71": "Conscious sedation is the most common method of pain relief used during ultrasound-directed transvaginal follicle aspiration (UDFA) for in-vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ETI). It is associated with minimal risks and facilitates early discharge following UDFA. The aim of this study was to assess clients' pain experience, acceptance of conscious sedation and correlates of pain during oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) at The Bridge Clinic, Port Harcourt. It was a cross-sectional survey conducted between May 1 and October 31 2004. Pain was assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Clients' pain experience and correlates were evaluated using Pearson's correlation and the student's t-test. The mean pain score was low and the duration of the procedure did not significantly affect the severity of pain felt by the client. Most (69.0%) clients would prefer the same sedation and analgesia for any subsequent procedure. Conscious sedation and analgesia are one of several methods used to relieve pain during oocyte retrieval in IVF procedures. The information in this study is of value when considering the management of pain in patients undergoing oocyte retrieval procedures.",

    "73": "The pan-European SOHO study is a 3-year, prospective, outpatient, observational study of outcomes associated with antipsychotic treatment, focusing on olanzapine, in ten European countries. For the cost-utility analysis, healthcare resource use (inpatient care, day care, outpatient psychiatric consultations and antipsychotic and concomitant medication use) and EQ-5D data were collected at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. The perspective was that of the health service payer. UK healthcare unit costs (year 2004 values) were applied to the resource use data for the ten countries. UK population tariffs were applied to the EQ-5D data to determine utility values.An Epoch analysis was used to analyze the longitudinal data. Multivariate regression analyses that adjusted for baseline covariates were used to estimate the incremental cost and utility gains for patients treated with olanzapine compared with each of the other antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpride, clozapine and oral or depot typical antipsychotics).", 
    "74": "A total of 10 972 patients were enrolled at baseline, of which 9107 completed the 12-month study period. Treatment with olanzapine was more effective in terms of QALYs gained than all of the other antipsychotic treatments. Treatment with olanzapine dominated quetiapine and amisulpride. The incremental cost for olanzapine compared with risperidone was pound sterling 226 per patient over 12 months and the incremental cost per QALY gained was pound 5156, with bootstrap analyses showing 100% of the replications falling below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold. Compared with treatment with clozapine, olanzapine was found to be marginally more effective, at an additional cost of pound sterling 13 per patient over 12 months and to have an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound sterling 775. Bootstrap analyses showed that 81% of replications fell below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold. Comparing olanzapine with oral and depot typical antipsychotics, the incremental cost was pound sterling 849 and pound sterling 1106 per patient over 12 months and the incremental cost per QALY gained was pound sterling 15 696 and pound sterling 23 331, respectively. Bootstrap analyses showed that 98% of the replications fell below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold for the comparison with oral typical antipsychotics, and 79% of replications for the comparison with depot preparations.",

    "76": "The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in intensive care units (ICUs) and to evaluate their effect on the length of stay. We performed a prospective study to detect ADRs in 420 patients hospitalised in 10 predetermined beds in the ICU of our hospital between the months of March and December 1996. While the patients were staying in the ICU, data was gathered regarding suspected ADRs and on different variables related to the length of stay. 96 different ADRs were detected in 85 of the 420 patients seen [20.2%, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 16.5 to 24.4]. The ADRs were most frequently caused by the following drugs: nitrates (n = 25), opiates (n = 21) and ultrashort-acting benzodiazepines (n = 10). Eight ADRs were severe, the suspected medication had to be discontinued in 51 cases and new drugs were necessary to manage the ADRs in 73 cases. The crude estimation of the effect of the number of ADRs performed with a bivariant regression model indicated that each ADR was related to a 2.38-day increase (95% CI 1.31 to 3.45) in the length of stay. Although this estimation was reduced to 1.76 days (95% CI 0.72 to 2.79), when other confounding variables associated with the length of stay were considered, it was still important.In conclusion, the ADRs were a significant clinical problem in the ICUs and were responsible for a significant increase in the length of stay.", 
    "77": "We report the use of a balanced anesthetic technique in a three-year-old, female Huacaya alpaca with an increased anesthetic risk that underwent an extensive dental surgery. Anesthesia was provided with an infusion of midazolam, fentanyl, S-ketamine and low concentrations of isoflurane in oxygen. The mandibular alveolar nerve was desensitized with a lidocaine-bupivacaine combination. The alpaca showed signs of hypoxemia fifteen minutes after anesthesia induction and arterial blood gases confirmed severe venous admixture. Application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6-9 cm H2O improved the arterial oxygenation. Other cardiopulmonary variables remained within the normal range. At the end of surgery, sarmazenil was administered to antagonize the effects of midazolam and emergence from anesthesia was smooth and uneventful. Flunixine meglumine and a transdermal delivery system for fentanyl were administered for post-operative analgesia. This method of balanced anesthesia allowed for an adequate anesthetic plane and a safe recovery, however, special ventilation strategies (PEEP) had to be applied.", 
    "78": "Melatonin (CAS 73-31-4) has both hypnotic and sleep/wake rhythm regulating properties. These sleep promoting actions, which are already demonstrable in healthy humans, have been found useful in subjects suffering from circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) like delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), jet lag and shift-work sleep disorder. Low nocturnal melatonin production and secretion have been documented in elderly insomniacs, and exogenous melatonin has been shown to be beneficial in treating sleep disturbances of these patients. In comparison to a number of sleep-promoting compounds that are usually prescribed, such as benzodiazepines and z-drugs (zolpidem and zopiclon belonging to the latter ones), melatonin has several advantages of clinical value: it does not cause hangover nor withdrawal effects and is devoid of any addictive potential. However, recent meta-analyses revealed that melatonin is not sufficiently effective in treating most primary sleep disorders. Some of the reasons for a limited efficacy of this natural hormone are related to its extremely short half-life in the circulation, and to the fact that sleep maintenance is also regulated by mechanisms downstream of primary melatonergic actions. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of melatonin receptor agonists with a longer half-life, which could be suitable for a successful treatment of insomnia. Such requirements are fulfilled by ramelteon (CAS 196597-26-9), which possesses a high affinity for the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 present in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Ramelteon also has a substantially longer half-life than melatonin. This new drug has been successfully used in treating elderly insomniacs without any adverse effects reported, and is promising for treating patients with primary insomnia and also those suffering from CRSD. Since sleep disturbances constitute the most prevalent symptoms of various forms of depression, the need for the development of an ideal antidepressant was felt, which would both improve sleep and mitigate depressive symptoms. Since most of the currently used antidepressants, including the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors worsen the sleep disturbances of depressive patients, another novel melatonergic drug, agomelatine (CAS 138112-76-2), holds some promise because of its particular combination of actions: it has a high affinity for MT1 and MT2 receptors in the SCN, but it acts additionally as a 5-HT(2C) antagonist [5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C antagonist]. The latter property, which is decisive for the antidepressive action, would not favor but potentially antagonize sleep, but this is overcome during night by the melatonergic, sleep-promoting effect. This drug has been found beneficial in treating patients with major depressive and seasonal affective disorders. Unlike the other antidepressants, agomelatine improves both sleep and clinical symptoms of depressive illness and does not have any of the side effects on sleep seen with other compounds in use. This property seems to be of particular value because of the aggravating effects of disturbed sleep in the development of depressive symptoms. Based on these facts, agomelatine seems to be a drug of superior efficacy with a promising future in the treatment of depressive disorders. However, long-term safety studies are required for both ramelteon and agomelatine, with a consideration of the pharmacology of their metabolites, their effects on redox metabolism, and of eventual undesired melatonergic effects, e. g., on reproductive functions. According to current data, both compounds seem to be safe during short-term treatment",

    "80": "The authors present an overview of the drug-facilitated crime (DFC) phenomenon, especially in France. Recently, there has been an increase in reports of incidents (mainly sexual assaults and robbery) as well as in scientific publications and congress presentations on the topic. From enquiries conducted nationally, a list of drugs reportedly associated with DFC was established and includes benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone), minor tranquilizers and neuroleptics, barbiturates, narcotics, hallucinogens, and anaesthetics. Some of these molecules are specific to France in DFC cases. A study using healthy volunteers who had taken benzodiazepines (lorazepam, bromazepam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam), zolpidem and zopiclone, showed that the only way to increase the duration of detection of these drugs is to use liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to test blood and urine samples. The very high sensitivity of this method appears to be an essential condition to document the cases, because the drugs tested were still detectable in urine at least 6 days after the ingestion of one therapeutic dose. Limits of detection were always lower than 0.5 ng/mL in urine. The actual list of molecules and metabolites the authors screened for in urine and blood by LC-MS/MS, in every DFC, is given in detail: 25 benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs, 11 minor tranquilizers and neuroleptics, 2 barbiturates, 12 narcotics, 4 hallucinogens, and 1 anaesthetic. However, the distinction between continual therapeutic use of a psychotropic drug or illegal narcotic and a single ingestion has to be documented by sequential analysis of hair, again with LC-MS/MS.", 
    "81": "Sexual assault is defined as any undesired physical contact of a sexual nature perpetrated against another person and is a prevalent problem presenting at emergency departments, emergency forensic medicine units, and rape crisis centres worldwide. Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) is a complex problem that is encountered with increasing frequency. But this problem is often underrepresented because most DFSAs are not reported by the frightened victims or are diagnosed as an acute drug or alcohol intoxication, thereby bypassing sexual abuse diagnosis and appropriate care. Proper care must be taken to ensure the chain of custody. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the phenomenon and work together with reference emergency forensic medicine units and rape crisis centres, which are capable of taking care of the male and female victims of sexual abuse. If no attention is given to the risk of DFSA, then toxicological samples (urine, blood, hair) and other biologic evidence may remain unidentified and semen, vaginal secretions, and vaginal epithelial cells cannot be genetically typed by a crime laboratory. This article reports the main clinical aspects of DFSA encountered in emergency departments at the beginning of the 21st century and the experience of an emergency forensic medicine unit based at a hospital (Compi\u00e8gne, France). Guidelines are proposed for clinical examination of DFSA victims, clinical forensic medical examination, and accurate samplings for further toxicological and biological evidence.", 
    "82": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, robbery) has caused some alarm in the general public. Drugs involved can be pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam), hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem), sedatives (neuroleptics, some antihistamines), or anesthetics (GHB, ketamine); drugs of abuse such as cannabis, ecstasy, or LSD; or, more often, ethanol. Mistreatment of older people, whether it is abuse or neglect, can be classified as physical, psychologic, or financial/material. Several types of mistreatment may occur simultaneously. Very few data are available in the international literature. It seems that mental abuse and neglect are more frequent, but physical abuse such as beating, pushing, kicking, and possibly sexual abuse have also been reported. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), can possess amnesic properties, and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood, or even urine, can be inadequate. This is the reason why some laboratories have developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations in which, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biologic specimens. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses, but as a complement. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry technologies appear to be required for analyses in drug-facilitated cases. The experience of the authors is presented in cases involving the elderly and chemical poisoning.", 
    "83": "In the last few years, significant developments have occurred on the key issues involved in oral fluid drug testing. New pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted, optimal cutoffs have been proposed, and new studies have examined the correlation between oral fluid drug concentrations and impairment. Recent studies (eg, the discovery of the presence of THC-COOH in oral fluid) can contribute to solve the issue of false-positive results caused by passive exposure to marijuana. Reliable point-of-care drug testing is still problematic, especially for cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. To date, there is no device that allows both reliable and practical point-of-care testing. The importance of liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry in confirmation analysis has increased over the last several years. It can be expected that this trend will continue because the low sample volumes make simultaneous detection of different drug classes with limited sample preparation necessary. Literature on proficiency testing to ensure reliability and comparability of results is limited. Oral fluid has become an important sample type in driving under the influence research, and the first legal random drug testing program in oral fluid since 2004 has been organized in Victoria. It can be expected that the role of oral fluid as an alternative matrix will keep increasing in the future.",

A goal of the study was to assess commercial oral fluid drug testing devices for potential use in law enforcement. Ten devices were evaluated in the laboratory for their ability to meet manufacturers' claimed (and proposed) cutoff concentrations for the detection of amphetamine(s), cocaine/metabolite, opiates, cannabinoids, and benzodiazepines (2 devices). The field study portion of the research was conducted in major cities in the United States and Western Europe by teams of scientists working in collaboration with the local police. In Salt Lake City, Utah, the Drugwipe, Securetec, Ottobrunn, Germany (Securetec) oral fluids drug testing device was also evaluated in the field by testing suspected drug-impaired drivers. During the initial phase of the field study, 40 subjects were recruited. Drugwipe results were compared with laboratory-based immunoassay and mass spectrometry results and demonstrated that calculated sensitivities were between 75% and 100% depending on drug class. Specificities varied from 36% for cannabinoids to over 95% for opiates. During the second phase of the field study, 267 subjects were recruited. The Drugwipe sensitivities were 36.4%, 35.9%, 42.9%, and 7.7%, respectively, for amphetamine(s), cocaine, opiates, and cannabinoids. The Drugwipe specificities were 99.2%, 97.4%, 99.6%, and 99.6%, respectively, for amphetamine(s), cocaine, opiates, and cannabinoids.

    "85": "Many clinically important drugs target ligand-gated ion channels; however, the mechanisms by which these drugs modulate channel function remain elusive. Benzodiazepines (BZDs), anesthetics, and barbiturates exert their CNS actions by binding to GABA(A) receptors and modulating their function. The structural mechanisms by which BZD binding is transduced to potentiation or inhibition of GABA-induced current (I(GABA)) are essentially unknown. Here, we explored the role of the gamma(2)Q182-R197 region (Loop F/9) in the modulation of I(GABA) by positive (flurazepam, zolpidem) and negative [3-carbomethoxy-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline (DMCM)] BZD ligands. Each residue was individually mutated to cysteine, coexpressed with wild-type alpha(1) and beta(2) subunits in Xenopus oocytes, and analyzed using two-electrode voltage clamp. Individual mutations differentially affected BZD modulation of I(GABA). Mutations affecting positive modulation span the length of this region, whereas gamma(2)W183C at the beginning of Loop F was the only mutation that adversely affected DMCM inhibition. Radioligand binding experiments demonstrate that mutations in this region do not alter BZD binding, indicating that the observed changes in modulation result from changes in BZD efficacy. Flurazepam and zolpidem significantly slowed covalent modification of gamma(2)R197C, whereas DMCM, GABA, and the allosteric modulator pentobarbital had no effects, demonstrating that gamma(2)Loop F is a specific transducer of positive BZD modulator binding. Therefore, gamma(2)Loop F plays a key role in defining BZD efficacy and is part of the allosteric pathway allowing positive BZD modulator-induced structural changes at the BZD binding site to propagate through the protein to the channel domain.", 
    "86": "Typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs have been shown to have different clinical and behavioral profiles. Haloperidol (HAL) is a typical neuroleptic that acts primarily as a D(2) dopamine receptor antagonist. It has been proposed that reactive oxygen species play a causative role in neurotoxic effects induced by HAL. We evaluated oxidative damage in rat brain induced by chronic (28 days) HAL, clozapine (CLO), olanzapine (OLZ) or aripiprazole (ARI) administration. Adult male Wistar rats received daily injections of HAL (1.5 mg/kg), CLO (25 mg/kg), OLZ (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg) or ARI (2, 10 or 20 mg/kg); control animals received vehicle (Tween 1% solution). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonylation were measured in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex. The results showed that TBARS were increased in the striatum after HAL treatment. On the other hand, TBARS were diminished in the prefrontal cortex by OLZ and ARI. Our results also showed that all drugs tested in this work decreased TBARS levels in the cerebral cortex. In hippocampus, TBARS levels were not altered by any drug. Protein carbonyl content after HAL and CLO treatment was increased in the hippocampus. Moreover, OLZ and ARI did not alter protein carbonyl content when compared to control group. ARI chronic administration (20 mg/kg) also increased mitochondrial superoxide in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. ARI did not alter mitochondrial superoxide in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Moreover, HAL, OLZ and CLO did not cause significant alterations in mitochondrial superoxide in rat brain. Our findings demonstrate that OLZ and ARI do not induce oxidative damage in rat brain as observed after HAL and CLO treatment.", 
    "87": "Gastro-oesophageal acid reflux may cause airway responses such as cough, bronchoconstriction and inflammation in asthmatic patients. Studies in humans or in animals have suggested that these responses involve cholinergic nerves. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the efferent vagal component on airway microvascular leakage induced by instillation of hydrochloric acid (HCl) into the oesophagus of guinea-pigs and the subtype of muscarinic receptors involved. Airway microvascular leakage induced by intra-oesophageal HCl instillation was abolished by bilateral vagotomy or by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, hexamethonium. HCl-induced leakage was inhibited by pretreatment with atropine, a non-specific muscarinic receptor antagonist, and also by pretreatment with either pirenzepine, a muscarinic M(1) receptor antagonist, or 4-DAMP, a muscarinic M(3) receptor antagonist. Pirenzepine was more potent than atropine and 4-DAMP. These antagonists were also studied on airway microvascular leakage or bronchoconstriction induced by intravenous administration of acetylcholine (ACh). Atropine, pirenzepine and 4-DAMP inhibited ACh-induced airway microvascular leakage with similar potencies. In sharp contrast, 4-DAMP and atropine were more potent inhibitors of ACh-induced bronchoconstriction than pirenzepine. Methoctramine, a muscarinic M(2) receptor antagonist, was ineffective in all experimental conditions. These results suggest that airway microvascular leakage caused by HCl intra-oesophageal instillation involves ACh release from vagus nerve terminals and that M(1) and M(3) receptors play a major role in cholinergic-mediated microvascular leakage, whereas M(3) receptors are mainly involved in ACh-induced bronchoconstriction.",

Alcohol and cannabis were both more prevalent amongst males. Mean ages were significantly younger for decedents who tested positive for a substance and for an illicit drug. Cases where death resulted from a physical altercation were more likely to have had alcohol and cannabis present. Illicit drugs were prominent amongst firearms deaths. The proportion of alcohol positive cases increased from 25.0% on Monday to 49.4% for Saturdays/Sundays. Alcohol was more common in incidents in the 0001-0600 h and 1800-2400 h periods.

The following laboratory parameters were not obtained during the initial evaluation: serum sodium (9% of patients), serum or ionized calcium (22%), and serum glucose (16%). When serum glucose was measured, results were not available for 20 minutes or more in 37% of the patients. Ninety-two patients were treated with anticonvulsant medication as they were having active seizure activity at the initial presentation. Primary drug therapy for SE did not include a benzodiazepine in 11% of the treated patients. When a benzodiazepine was administered, dosing was outside of suggested guidelines in 22.5% of patients. Respiratory compromise was more common in patients who received a benzodiazepine dose greater than suggested guidelines.",

Using the case of Mr X, a 33-year-old man with advanced metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix and \"15 out of 10\" pain, we explore the issues of acute pain and its management. We define a pain crisis as an event in which the patient reports pain that is severe, uncontrolled, and causing distress for the patient, family members, or both. Our management strategy focuses on making a pain diagnosis, differentiating reversible from intractable causes of pain, and making decisions about further workup; selecting the opioid and monitoring and treating opioid adverse effects; titrating and rotating opioid and coanalgesics; consulting experts to treat a pain crisis as quickly as possible to prevent unnecessary suffering; and co-opting the available institutional resources. The timely intervention of a palliative care team and its expertise can provide the staff, patients, and their families the benefit of an interdisciplinary approach and help the patients address goals of care; understand the benefits and risks of treatment decisions; and meet the psychological, social, and existential needs of the patient and the family commonly seen in this setting.",

Patients were divided into groups, based on the occurrence of FI defined as aspiration of gastric residuals greater than 75 mL for 2 consecutive measurements.", 
    "107": "Forty-eight percent (29 of 61) of patients experienced FI based on our definition. The median pentobarbital infusion rate did not differ significantly between patients who experienced FI versus those who did not (median [intraquartile range, IQR] 1.8 mg/kg/h [1.4, 2.1] vs 1.7 mg/kg/h [1.4, 2.5]; p = 0.680). The total pentobarbital bolus dose during the first 24 hours of therapy was lower in patients who experienced FI (700 mg [225, 980] vs 1000 mg [600, 1475]; p = 0.029). Median duration of pentobarbital therapy was comparable between groups (141.0 h [93.3, 217.3] vs 116.3 h [64.0, 174.8]; p = 0.115). Other factors with the potential to influence FI, such as catecholamines, neuromuscular blockade, and hyperglycemia, were similar between groups. The higher narcotic doses and greater percentage of patients receiving benzodiazepines in the FI group warrants further study.",

Due to paranoia and agitation, the dose was increased to 5 mg twice daily after 2 days. Subsequently, he developed hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose 138 mg/dL) that resolved when olanzapine was stopped and recurred (fasting blood glucose 150 mg/dL) after 2 days of rechallenge with olanzapine 2.5 mg twice daily. In addition, his overall medical status worsened, as he developed concurrent acute renal failure and became more confused and lethargic. The hyperglycemia once again resolved with discontinuation of the drug.", 
    "111": "We postulate that the rapid onset of hyperglycemia and the resulting medical sequelae were due to olanzapine. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probable. There have been numerous case reports of hyperglycemia with olanzapine in the literature, but none reported hyperglycemia within days of initiation of the medication. Although weight gain often coincides with hyperglycemia in patients taking atypical antipsychotics, it does not seem to be a necessary causal factor. Recent data in animal studies have indicated that olanzapine and clozapine rapidly impair whole-body insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner.",

    "113": "Profound evidence indicates that GABAA receptors are important in the control of physiological response to stress and anxiety. The alpha subunit type composition contributes significantly to the functional characterization of the GABAA receptors. The alpha2, alpha3, alpha5 subunits are predominately expressed in the brain during embryonic and early postnatal periods of normal rats, whilst alpha1 are most prominent during later developmental stages. In the present study, we examined the long-term effects of juvenile stress on GABA alpha subunit expression in adulthood in the amygdala and hippocampus. We applied the elevated platform stress paradigm at juvenility and used the open-field and startle response tests to assess anxiety level in adulthood. Juvenile stress effects without behavioural tests in adulthood were also examined since previous studies indicated that the mere exposure to these tests might be stressful for rats, enhancing the effects of the juvenile exposure to stress. In adulthood, we quantitatively determined the level of expression of alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3 in the hippocampus and amygdala. Our results indicate that subjecting juvenile stressed rats to additional challenges in adulthood results in an immature-like expression profile of these subunits. To test for potential functional implications of these alterations we examined the effects of the anxiolytic (diazepam) and the sedative (brotizolam) benzodiazepines on juvenile stressed and control rats following additional challenges in adulthood. Juvenile stressed rats were more sensitive to diazepam and less sensitive to brotizolam, suggesting that the alterations in GABA alpha subunit expression in these animals have functional consequences.",

We also determined effects on GG activity with local application to the hypoglossal motor nucleus (HMN).",

Rats were also exposed to ramp increases in inspired CO2 in NREM sleep. The effects of lorazepam and zolpidem applied directly to the HMN were also determined in 37 anesthetized rats.", 
    "121": "Lorazepam, zolpidem and diphenhydramine all increased arousal threshold, consistent with their sedative action. GG activity before arousal in response to hypercapnia was increased with lorazepam and zolpidem only, an effect mainly due to increased baseline activity before CO2 stimulation. Lorazepam and zolpidem applied directly to the HMN, however, decreased GG activity.", 
    "122": "Lorazepam and zolpidem have an inhibitory effect on GG activity via local effects at the HMN. Following systemic administration, however, this inhibitory effect can be outweighed both by a delay in arousal (allowing greater CO2-mediated respiratory stimulation in sleep) and excitatory influences on baseline GG activity via mechanisms operating outside the HMN.",

On presentation her vital signs were T 39 degrees C, P 125 beats/minute, R 26 breaths/minute, and BP 153/79 mmHg. She was initially obtunded, but minutes after presentation had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting approximately two minutes, which ceased after 2 mg of intravenous lorazepam. She was sedated, intubated and treated with sodium bicarbonate. Her peak salicylate concentration was 152 mg/dL. Her course was complicated by seizures and dysrhythmias, including monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and Torsades de Pointes. With bicarbonate therapy, hemodialysis, and veno-venous hemofiltration, she survived neurologically intact.", 
    "125": "The etiology of these dysrhythmias is likely multifactorial. Metabolic derangements typically encountered with severe salicylism, including insensible water losses, respiratory alkalosis, and metabolic acidosis, may contribute. Iatrogenic causes, especially sodium bicarbonate therapy, may cause hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Additionally, animal data suggests that high salicylate concentrations may have direct deleterious effects on the electrophysiology of cardiac cells, specifically by its action on the SA node and on the action potential of atria and Purkinje fibers.",

    "128": "First, using diazepam distribution data in rat tissues and fuzzy regression, we estimated fuzzy rat tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients (Kp's). We scaled the coefficients prior to human PBPK modeling. Next, we constructed the fuzzy set of hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint) by integrating CLint values measured in vitro from human hepatocytes. Finally, we used these parameters, and other physiological and biochemical information, to predict human diazepam disposition. We compared the simulated plasma kinetics with published concentration-time profiles.",

EGIS-8332 was active in EPM and LD while EGIS-9637 showed anxiolytic-like potency in EPM, mCPP and Vogel model. EGIS-10608 was the most effective compound among 2,3BDZs tested in EPM and Vogel models (MEDs are 0.01 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively). 2,3BDZs were active in anxiety models at doses lower than those produced sedative effects. NBQX showed anxiolytic-like activity in EPM only (3 mg/kg).",

At low GABA concentrations, flurazepam markedly enhanced current amplitudes both at normal and acidic pH, but at the latter, the relative effect was larger. In contrast, at saturating GABA concentrations, flurazepam reduced current amplitudes at both pH 7.2 and 6.0. The slowing of deactivation kinetics by flurazepam decreased with GABA concentration, but at pH 6.0, this trend was shifted toward a higher GABA concentration.",

    "159": "The management of acute episodes in schizophrenia is frequently initiated in the psychiatric emergency department and requires rapid intervention to relieve distress and psychiatric symptoms. Both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are needed to calm the patient and prevent potential harm to the patient or others. Treatment is a step-by-step process including management of behavioral symptomatology, diagnosis of potential organic causes, and evaluation of potential substance abuse. Better care is delivered if predefined standard operating procedures are adopted systematically. The ultimate goal of treatment is to establish a therapeutic alliance with the patient. Atypical antipsychotics given orally are recommended as a first-line treatment. As the treatment endpoint is calmness rather than sleep, a non-sedative antipsychotic agent is usually preferred. Drug tolerance is a major issue for the patient. Amisulpride is an effective atypical antipsychotic agent in this context. The optimal dose is 800 mg/day, which is effective on positive and negative symptoms and can be given from the first day with a low risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Since drug-drug interactions are limited, agitation and anxiety may be controlled by short-term adjunctive therapy with benzodiazepines. In conclusion, amisulpride is an appropriate first-line treatment for the management of acute psychosis.",

The overall US and European estimated crude incidence rate of SE ranges from 6.8 to 41/100,000/yr. The etiologies of SE include primary central nervous system pathologies and systemic disorders. The two basic mechanisms involved in the genesis of SE are an excess of excitatory activity and a loss of normal inhibitory neurotransmission. Mortality associated with SE can be as high as 26% for the average adult. Early recognition and treatment are important for improving the chances for a good outcome. The first line of treatment is an intravenous benzodiazepine, with lorazepam being the current preferred agent. All patients with SE who remain with altered awareness 20 to 30 minutes after cessation of clinical seizures should undergo electroencephalographic studies, because up to 20% of patients without clinical evidence of seizures after initial treatment can have nonconvulsive SE.",

Its impact on newborn breathing has not been documented despite potential deleterious consequences for later brain development. We addressed this issue in neonatal rats (0-2 d) born from dams, which consumed 2 mg/kg/d diazepam via drinking fluid throughout gestation. In vivo, prenatal diazepam exposure significantly altered the normoxic-breathing pattern, lowering breathing frequency (105 vs. 125 breaths/min) and increasing tidal volume (16.2 vs. 12.7 mL/kg), and the ventilatory response to hypoxia, inducing an immediate and marked decrease in tidal volume (-30%) absent in controls. In vitro, prenatal diazepam exposure significantly increased the respiratory-like frequency produced by pontomedullary and medullary preparations (+38% and +19%, respectively) and altered the respiratory-like response to application of nonoxygenated superfusate. Both in vivo and in vitro, the recovery from oxygen deprivation challenges was delayed by prenatal diazepam exposure. Finally, real-time PCR showed that prenatal diazepam exposure affected mRNA levels of alpha1 and alpha2 GABAA receptor subunits and of A1 and A2A adenosine receptors in the brainstem. These mRNA changes, which are region-specific, suggest that prenatal diazepam exposure interferes with developmental events whose impact on the respiratory system maturation deserves further studies.",

    "172": "At study entry, spherical equivalent was -2.10 +/- 0.90 D (mean +/- SD) for the pirenzepine group (n = 117) and -1.93 +/- 0.83 D for the placebo group (n = 57; p = 0.22). At 1 year, there was a mean increase in myopia of 0.26 D in the pirenzepine group versus 0.53 D in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Eighty-four patients elected to continue for a second year (pirenzepine = 53, placebo = 31). At 2 years, the mean increase in myopia was 0.58 D for the pirenzepine group and 0.99 D for the placebo group (p = 0.008). Thirteen (11%) pirenzepine patients dropped out due to adverse effects in the first year, and 1 did so in the second year.",

Cranial CT scan was performed on a spiral CT and MRI on a 1.5 T scanner. Patients were treated with IV sodium valproate, phenytoin and benzodiazepines as per fixed protocol. Outcome was defined as seizure control at 1h and mortality. Various clinical and radiological parameters were correlated.", 
    "176": "There were 99 patients with SE whose mean age was 35 (1-78) years, 40 females and 17 were below 12 years of age. Fifty six patients had central nervous system (CNS) infections, 15 strokes, 13 metabolic encephalopathy, 5 drug default and in the remaining 10 patients various acute symptomatic causes were present. Cranial imaging was abnormal in 59% patients. CT was abnormal in 21 (47.7%) out of 44 patients whereas MRI was abnormal in 26 (63.4%) out of 41 patients. Both MRI and CT were carried out in 14 patients and 12 revealed abnormalities; 2 had abnormality only on MRI. Imaging revealed cortical lesions in 10, subcortical in 19 and both cortical as well as subcortical in 30 patients. One hour seizure control was achieved in 60, seizures recurred within 24h in 38 and 27 patients died during hospital stay. Seizure type, duration of SE, seizure control at 1h and mortality did not correlate with radiological abnormalities.",

    "178": "Double gap metabolic acidosis represents the high anion gap metabolic acidosis combined with raised serum osmolal gap due to retention of unmeasured osmole with accompanied metabolite. We describe a 62-year-old man diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia undergoing continuous sedation in the context of asynchronous mechanical ventilation. High anion gap metabolic acidosis coupled with high plasma osmolal gap was noted with resultant severe bradyarrhythmia. D-Lactic acidosis and high serum concentration of propylene glycol (PG) eventually established the diagnosis of lorazepam-induced PG intoxication. Discontinuation of lorazepam followed by emergent long-extended hemodialysis effectively resolved the metabolic derangement without further recurrence. Serum osmolal gap is a sensitive and convenient surrogate for both early bedside detection and monitoring the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, PG intoxication must be considered in the differential diagnosis of double gap metabolic acidosis. Early recognition with prompt hemodialysis intervention can avoid a life-threatening catastrophe.",

    "180": "The present study investigated body weight gain, food intake, open-field activity and brain histamine H1 receptor mRNA and protein expression in rats treated with three types of antipsychotics. Rats were divided into eight groups and treated with aripiprazole (2.25mg/kg/day), olanzapine (1.5mg/kg/day), haloperidol (0.3mg/kg/day) or vehicle (as control) for 1 or 12 weeks. Administration of olanzapine for 1 week led to a threefold increase in body weight gain and a 35% increase in fat deposits compared to controls (p<0.05). In the 12-week olanzapine treatment group, accumulative food intake was significantly higher in the first 7 weeks of treatment compared to controls (p<0.018), while body weight gain was significantly greater in the first 8 weeks compared to controls (p<0.045). Using in situ hybridization, we found that olanzapine treatment, but not aripiprazole or haloperidol treatment, significantly reduced H1 receptor mRNA expression in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc: -18%, p=0.006, 1 week; -20%, p=0.008, 12 weeks) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH: -22%, p=0.006, 1 week; -19%, p=0.042, 12 weeks) compared to controls. The quantitative autoradiography data showed a reduction in VMH H1 receptor binding density after 1 (-12%, p=0.040) and 12 (-10%, p=0.094) weeks of olanzapine treatment. There were significant negative correlations between the levels of H1 receptor mRNA expression, and body weight gain and energy efficiency in the Arc and VMH after 1- and 12-week antipsychotic treatments in all groups. In addition, H1 receptor mRNA expression in the Arc showed a significant negative correlation with food intake and fat mass in all groups. Furthermore, there were negative correlations between H1 receptor binding density in the VMH and total fat mass and body weight gain after 1 week of antipsychotic treatment. The present study suggests that downregulated VMH and Arc H1 receptor expression may be a key factor contributing to olanzapine-induced obesity.", 
    "181": "alpha2 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors are involved in incentive learning associated with cocaine, and in cocaine addiction. Deletion of alpha2-containing receptors abolishes cocaine-induced behavioural sensitisation (BS), while selective activation of alpha2 receptors, achieved using Ro 15-4513's agonist properties in alpha2(H101R) mice, induced BS. Here, we investigate further the mechanisms underlying Ro 15-4513-induced behavioural sensitisation in alpha2(H101R) mice. alpha2(H101R) mice sensitised to Ro 15-4513 (10 mg/kg) showed an enhanced stimulant response to cocaine (10 mg/kg). In contrast, cocaine (10 mg/kg)-sensitised alpha2(H101R) mice did not show enhanced sensitivity to the stimulant effects of Ro 15-4513 (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg), suggesting that the neural adaptations underlying Ro 15-4513 induced BS are related to, but not identical with those associated with cocaine-induced plasticity. Secondly, we investigated whether alpha2-containing receptors are involved in mediating the ability of BZs to facilitate cocaine-induced activity. The non-selective (i.e., alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 subtype) benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor agonist midazolam (10 and 30 mg/kg) potentiated cocaine (10 mg/kg) hyperactivity in wildtype mice, but not in alpha2(H101R) mice, in which alpha2-containing receptors are insensitive to benzodiazepines. To determine where alpha2 receptors are localised we compared BZ-insensitive sites between wildtype (alpha4 and alpha6) and alpha2(H101R) (alpha2, alpha4 and alpha6) mice, using quantitative autoradiography to estimate [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding in the presence of 10 muM diazepam. alpha2 receptors were found in projection areas of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway including accumbens, central amygdala, and basolateral amygdala as well as CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus. The involvement of the alpha2-containing receptor in mediating BZ's potentiating effect on cocaine hyperactivity suggests that the locomotor stimulant effects of BZs and psychostimulants may be mediated by a common neural system, but the lack of cross sensitisation to Ro 15-4513 in cocaine-sensitised alpha2(H101R) mice, suggests that this form of BS may occur downstream of plastic events underlying cocaine sensitisation.", 
    "182": "Lichenoid drug eruptions can mimic idiopathic lichen planus and other dermatoses. The list of drugs that can cause them is long and growing steadily. Although cutaneous side effects of antipsychotics are rare, various cutaneous manifestations have been reported in association with olanzapine. We present the case of a patient who developed an atypical lichenoid eruption due to olanzapine. A review of the literature in Medline from 1951 to 2007 and in the Indice M\u00e9dico Espa\u00f1ol (Spanish Medical Index) revealed no previous cases of lichenoid eruptions associated with the use of this drug.",

General practitioners (GPs) tend to prescribe anxiolytics and other benzodiazepines to patients with major depressive disorders (MDD). However, the extent to and reasons for which they prescribe these medications together are not well documented. This article assesses how often and why GPs coprescribe an anxiolytic when starting patients on antidepressant (AD) treatment, and which patient- and GP-related factors are associated with this coprescription.", 
    "184": "We used a survey of 131 GPs practising in southeastern France and of patients seen consecutively during June to October 2004 to whom they prescribed an AD. Data were collected from GPs (consultation-questionnaires focusing on their prescription, diagnosis, and symptom detection) and patients (self-administered questionnaires, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, and social and demographic characteristics). Factors associated with anxiolytic coprescription were analyzed with a multilevel logistic regression.", 
    "185": "GPs completed 438 consultation-questionnaires for patients; 258 patients (58.9%) returned their questionnaires. Sixty percent of the patients received anxiolytics with ADs. Anxiolytics were prescribed more frequently by male GPs who reported feeling ill at ease treating MDD, or detected suicidal ideation or anxiety in their patients, and finally to patients with stable jobs.", 
    "186": "Although some practice guidelines and authors acknowledge that there might be some justification for coprescribing anxiolytics with ADs at the beginning of MDD treatment in specific situations, the high percentage of coprescriptions for anxiolytics observed in our study suggests that training and knowledge of GPs about MDD treatment are not optimal.", 
    "187": "Imidazopyridineacetoamide 5-8, a series of novel and potentially selective peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands with affinities comparable to those of known PBR ligands, was investigated. Radiosyntheses of [11C]5, 6, 7 or 8 was accomplished by N-methylation of the corresponding desmethyl precursors with [11C]methyl iodide in the presence of NaH in dimethylformamide (DMF), resulting in 25% to 77% radiochemical yield and specific activitiy of 20 to 150 MBq/nmol. Each of the labeled compounds was injected in ddY mice, and the radioactivity and weight of dissected peripheral organs and brain regions were measured. Organ distribution of [11C]7 was consistent with the known PBR distribution. Moreover, [11C]7 showed the best combination of brain uptake and PBR binding, leading to its high retention in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, areas where PBR density is high in mouse brain. Coinjection of PK11195 or unlabeled 7 significantly reduced the brain uptake of [11C]7. These results suggest that [11C]7 could be a useful radioligand for positron emission tomography imaging of PBRs.",

FEPPA displayed a Ki of 0.07 nM for PBR in rat mitochondrial membrane preparations and a suitable lipophilicity for brain penetration (log P of 2.99 at pH 7.4). Upon intravenous injection into rats, [18F]-FEPPA showed moderate brain uptake [standard uptake value (SUV) of 0.6 at 5 min] and a slow washout (SUV of 0.35 after 60 min). Highest uptake of radioactivity was seen in the hypothalamus and olfactory bulb, regions previously reported to be enriched in PBR in rat brain. Analysis of plasma and brain extracts demonstrated that [18F]-FEPPA was rapidly metabolized, but no lipophilic metabolites were observed in either preparation and only 5% radioactive metabolites were present in brain tissue extracts. Blocking studies to determine the extent of specific binding of [18F]-FEPPA in rat brain were problematic due to large perturbations in circulating radiotracer and the lack of a reference region.",

    "193": "A system for controlling target tissue concentration (UIPump) was used to regulate whole-brain concentrations of a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist at therapeutic levels with input from brain kinetics as determined with PET. The system was tested by using pharmacological doses of flumazenil mixed with tracer amounts of [11C]flumazenil. Flumazenil was used as a model compound for anesthesia. An infusion scheme to produce three different steady-state levels in sequence was designed based on kinetic curves obtained after bolus injection. The subjects (Sprague-Dawley rats, n=6) were monitored in a microPET scanner during the whole experiment to verify resulting brain kinetic curves.",

The results reflect the substitution pattern and suggest that the presence of a bulky and electropositive group in the five-member ring and electron withdrawing groups in the seven-member ring will have a positive impact on the antiviral activity of the derivatives. Bulky groups in the six-member ring do not show an activity-enhancing impact. Outlier analysis too reconfirms our findings.

    "197": "While the epidemiologic trends concerning alprazolam (Xanax) are unknown, the use of benzodiazepines, in general, has increased in popularity among youth within recent years. To shed light on the drug problem, the current pilot study used a qualitative approach to investigate relevant beliefs, norms, and perceived addiction associated with alprazolam initiation among 46 youth who were attending an inpatient drug treatment program during the spring of 2004. Overwhelmingly, most participants stated that addiction to alprazolam occurs as early as initial consumption. Most youth in the study stated that their friends felt it was normal to use alprazolam. In addition, their control beliefs revealed that if someone wanted to stop it would be difficult because of the widespread use in their communities and family social reinforcement involved with its use. In this study, a majority of students stated that medical professionals such as doctors and pharmacists were the greatest facilitator of alprazolam acquisition. Implications for these results are discussed.",

Sham-operated rats treated with saline, midazolam, or midazolam plus flumazenil exhibited no thermal hyperalgesia. Unexpectedly, thermal paw withdrawal latency in sham animals treated with flumazenil alone was significantly decreased. Changes in GAT-1 levels paralleled the behavior. Midazolam prevented the CCI-associated decreases, and flumazenil reversed midazolam's effect. Flumazenil alone did not modify GAT-1 levels in CCI animals but in sham animals the transporter levels were significantly reduced.",
