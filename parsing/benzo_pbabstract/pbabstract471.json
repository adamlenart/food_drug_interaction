    "0": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between 40 mg afloqualone, a new centrally acting muscle relaxant and 0.5 g/kg ethanol using a double-blind three-way cross-over trial in which subjects were each given afloqualone with ethanol, ethanol alone and afloqualone alone. We first compared the effects of 40 mg oral afloqualone and 15 mg diazepam (considered as a reference drug) on the psychomotor and cognitive performance and muscular relaxation of 12 healthy male volunteers. Performance was assessed by six objective tests and eight visual analogue self-rating scales. All the above treatments were separated by a 2-week interval. Volunteers performed the objective tests 1 h after drug ingestion, and the self-rating scale evaluations before drug intake and 1, 3.5, 6 and 8 h thereafter. Afloqualone impaired psychomotor performance less than diazepam as shown by the number of correct answers in the digit symbol cancellation test and the time needed to complete this test. However, the measurement of the frontalis muscle action potential showed that the muscle relaxant activity of 40 mg afloqualone was equivalent to that of 15 mg diazepam. Furthermore, afloqualone given at an effective relaxant dose did not enhance the effects of a single dose of ethanol which predominated on either psychomotor performance or subjective feelings.", 
    "1": "Poisoning is a significant problem in the elderly. The majority of poisonings in older people are unintentional and may result from dementia and confusion, improper use of the product, improper storage or mistaken identities. Depression is also common in the elderly and suicide attempts are more likely to be successful in this age group. The elderly patient's recuperative abilities may be inadequate as a result of numerous factors including impaired hepatic or renal function as well as chronic disease processes. General management of poisoning in the elderly parallels management of younger adults, but it is especially important to ascertain underlying medical conditions and concurrent medications. In most poisonings, activated charcoal and cathartic are sufficient. Haemodialysis or haemoperfusion may be required at lower plasma drug concentrations in elderly patients. While the specific indications for antidotes are the same for all age groups, dosage alterations and precautions may need to be considered in the elderly. Drugs most often implicated in poisonings in the elderly include psychotherapeutic drugs, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycaemics and theophylline. Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities occur with overdoses of neuroleptic drugs and, more frequently and severely, with cyclic antidepressants. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are at particular risk of worsening ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. Benzodiazepines only appear to produce significant toxicity during long term administration or in combination with other CNS depressants. Digoxin can cause both chronic and acute intoxication, most seriously cardiac toxicity including severe ventricular arrhythmias, second or third degree heart block or severe refractory hyperkalaemia. Immune Fab antibody is indicated for the management of digoxin toxicity, although patients dependent on the inotropic effect of digoxin may develop heart failure after digoxin Fab antibody administration. Nitrates can cause toxicity including headache, vomiting, hypotension and tachycardia from excessive sublingual, transdermal or intravenous doses. Conduction disturbances and hypotension occur with overdoses of antihypertensive drugs; these effects are mild with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, occasionally severe with beta-blockers and of significant concern with calcium channel antagonists. The elderly commonly use aspirin and other salicylates, are more likely to develop chronic intoxications to these agents, and are more susceptible to severe complications such as pulmonary oedema. Salicylate poisoning, recognition of which is often delayed, should be considered in elderly patients with neurological abnormalities or breathing difficulties, especially in the setting of acid-base abnormalities. The clinical effects of NSAID overdose are mild and usually involve the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The non-selective muscarinic antagonist ipratropium is widely used as bronchodilator. Due to its pharmacokinetic properties this drug, after inhalation, acts only locally on the airways and no unwanted anticholinergic side-effects are observed. Another approach is the use of selective muscarinic antagonists. Based on their selectivity for M3- and/or M1-receptors such drugs might show bronchospasmolytic properties without the occurrence of typical atropine-like side effects even after systemic administration. Pharmacological data of the in vivo bronchoselectivity of pirenzepine (M1-selective) and AQ-RA 721 (high affinity for M1- and M3-receptors) is presented and the use of these drugs as bronchodilators is discussed.", 
    "3": "An important aspect of modern extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is the ability to perform the procedure without anesthesia. Between June 1987 and April 1990, a total of 7,500 treatments were performed in our Lithotripsy Unit, using the Lithostar (Siemens AG, Erlangen, FRG): moreover 80% of the treatments were carried out as an anesthesia-free outpatient service. All treatments were reviewed for anesthetic requirements. Epidural anesthesia was performed in 74/7,500 (0.98%) treatments: during the initial period, the first 70 procedures were systematically performed under epidural anesthesia, and in 4 later cases of simultaneous endoscopic stone manipulation. Local skin infiltration was applied at the coupling site in 658/7,500 (8.7%) treatments. With increasing experience and technological improvement, 6,229/7,500 (83%) procedures were performed later on with only mild sedation: 1 mg of lorazepam orally 30 min before the treatment. Intravenous sedation was required in 510/7,500 (6.8%) cases because of painful local irritation, especially when treating calculi close to sites where shock waves can progress along the ribs. General anesthesia was required in all 28 children (0.4%).", 
    "4": "Toxic hepatitis developed but in one out of 127 peptic ulcer patients treated with cimetidine. In patients (n-142) treated with gastrozepine, no cases of toxic hepatitis were recorded. These anti-ulcer agents did not influence absorptive capacities of the liver or hepatic blood flow. Meanwhile microsomal exidase (antitoxic) function of hepatocytes noticeably declined as a result of cimetidine treatment in every 8th patient with peptic ulcer subjected to the continuous 5-week treatment with the drug and in every 5th patient given the treatment (maintenance included) for a longer time. In patients suffering from liver cirrhosis with secondary gastroduodenal ulcers or multiple erosions, the 5-week treatment either with almagel and platyphylline or gastrozepine provided approximately similar results and promoted ulcer and erosion healing in half the cases. Adjuvant 3-week therapy with sucralfate (venter) having cytoprotective properties led to the disappearance of gastroduodenal ulcers and erosions in 23 out of 26 patients, in whom the previous treatment was ineffective.", 
    "5": "The present study was designed to assess the proactive effects of late pregnancy benzodiazepine (BDZ) treatment on maternal behavior in the postpartum period, using cross-fostering procedures to control for the role of changes produced prenatally in the offspring. Outbred CD-1 mouse dams were treated with either oxazepam (OX, 15 mg/kg PO twice/day on pregnancy days 12-16) or vehicle (VEH). After parturition, entire litters were exchanged either within treatments (in-fostered groups, IF) or between treatments (cross-fostered groups, CF), while additional litters were left undisturbed (un-fostered groups, UF). The behavior of lactating dams was observed in their home cages at 4, 8, and 12 days postpartum. Maternal responses, particularly nursing, were reduced in the OX-UF and OX-CF conditions and either normal or enhanced in the OX-IF condition. Correspondingly, locomotor/exploratory activity was markedly enhanced in the former conditions and close to the control level in the latter condition. In sum, the fostering variable appeared to determine whether pups raised by dams treated previously with BDZ receive either insufficient or exaggerated maternal care. This points to the need for a better understanding of mother/pup interactions in studies aimed at characterizing drug and toxicant effects on offspring development.", 
    "6": "The impact of the avoidance behaviour on the psychopharmacological treatment of panic disorder was explored in the Cross National Collaborative Panic Study (n = 1134 patients); in this double blind randomized trial alprazolam, imipramine and placebo were compared during an 8-week treatment period. Patients with extensive avoidance behaviour (agoraphobia) had the most profit from the active drugs. Counter expectancy these specific drug effects were most pronounced in avoidance behaviour. Active drugs (in particular imipramine) were especially more effective than placebo if the patients presented with associated avoidance behaviour. The results suggest that agoraphobia defines more a particular type of anxiety disorder overlapping with panic disorder than merely a severe state of panic disorder.", 
    "7": "The effect of dormicum-ketalar and dormicum-ketalar-anexat in comparison with thiopental was studied on 45 parturients at 39-40 weeks' pregnancy, operated electively, divided into three groups as each group consisted of 15 women. The representative groups were compared by the following parameters: duration of the operation, age, weight, duration of induction in anaesthesia-extraction of the fetus, premedication, anaesthesia after the extraction of the fetus. Usage of dormicum ketalar for induction in anaesthesia during cesarean section did not affect the basic metabolic parameters of the parturients, fetus and amniotic fluid. Such a combination of preparations during simultaneous neutralization of the action of dormicum by anexat affects positively the fetal state, transport of O2 and activity of enzymes, in order that the fetus could survive more favourably this critical state.", 
    "8": "The experiments were performed in the younger adult normotensive rats of Wistar strain and in the genetically hypertensive rats of Koletsky type. Motor activity was traced under regime 12 h light/12 h dark (light on at 6 A. M., light off at 6 P. M.). The activity was traced from 10 h A. M. during 24 hours by pneumoactograph described by Weggemenn. In the control genetically hypertensive males of Koletsky type phase advance was found when compared with the normotensive rats of Wistar strain. This phase advance in the former animals is missing under acute diazepam treatment (0.5 mg/kg). In control animals the novelty induced hyperactivity shows in the genetically hypertensive males of Koletsky type the lower rate of habituation than in the normotensive males of Wistar strain, i. e., the former animals show \"sustained activity\" in new environment. Novelty induced hyperactivity was alleviated in both strains of rats by the acute diazepam treatment; the effect of the latter drug was more expressive in the normotensive rats of Wistar strain.", 
    "9": "The efficacy of a number of drug pretreatment combinations in protecting mice against lethal effects of soman was determined. Pyridostigmine peroral pretreatment followed by intramuscular postpoisoning therapy with atropine, obidoxime and/or trimedoxime, and diazepam protected mice against the lethal action of soman. Combination of pyridostigmine with trihexyphenidyl, benactyzine and bis-(4-hydroxyiminomethyl) pyridinium-methane dichloride improved prophylactic action even further.", 
    "10": "Young injecting drug users (IDUs) in Australia are a group about whom little is known. It is suggested, however, that their drug using behaviours and life styles put them at particular risk for HIV/AIDS. Data collected in Perth from 195 respondents in the Australian National AIDS and Injecting Drug Use Study was analyzed with emphasis on the distinctions between young and older injecting drug users. It was found that, relative to those aged 23 or over, IDUs under 23 used more stimulants and LSD and fewer opiates and benzodiazepines; were more likely to inject all or most of their drugs; were less likely to have been in treatment; had more sex partners; were less likely to have changed their drug taking behaviour because of AIDS; were less likely to use alone; shared needles less frequently but shared at least some of the time; and had less knowledge of AIDS and were more pessimistic about the long term outcomes of AIDS. Such characteristics need to be taken into account if effective intervention and prevention strategies for this group are planned.", 
    "11": "A study was designed to assess the efficacy of oral premedication with diazepam or enprostil in preventing the gastric aspiration syndrome in fasted patients scheduled for elective surgery, and to compare the results with those obtained with ranitidine and sodium citrate. The study included 120 consecutive patients undergoing urological or plastic surgery, randomly assigned to four groups of 30. Two hours before anaesthesia, the patients from three groups were given, with 30 ml of water, either 10 mg diazepam, or 150 mg ranitidine, or 35 micrograms enprostil. Those in the fourth group were given 30 ml of 0.5 M sodium citrate, ten minutes before induction. Anaesthesia consisted in the administration of thiopentone, fentanyl, vecuronium and nitrous oxide in oxygen. After endotracheal intubation, a gastric tube was inserted. The stomach fluid content was completely aspirated, and then again 60 and 120 min after induction, as well as at the end of surgery. Age, weight and duration of surgery were comparable in the four groups. Mean pH in the diazepam group was much lower than that in the other groups, both just after induction (2.3 +/- 1.54; p less than 0.001 vs. ranitidine and sodium citrate; p less than 0.01 vs. enprostil) and at the end of surgery (3.2 +/- 2.03; p less than 0.01 vs. ranitidine and sodium citrate; p less than 0.05 vs. enprostil). There was more than 0.4 ml.kg-1 gastric juice in the sodium citrate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "The pharmacokinetics of a single 2 mg IV dose of chlordesmethyldiazepam has been studied in 11 patients with renal failure on regular haemodialysis and in 11 age-matched healthy controls. The kinetics was also examined after a single 2 mg oral dose in 6 of the 11 renal failure patients. After intravenous administration the kinetics of total chlordesmethyldiazepam in renal patients and controls were the same. The unbound fraction of the drug in renal patients was higher (5.5%) than in controls (2.9%). Correction for differences in protein binding revealed a reduced apparent volume of distribution (47 vs. 140 l.kg-1) and a reduced clearance (5.0 vs. 10.5 ml.min-1.kg-1) in the patients. The systemic availability of oral chlordesmethyldiazepam was good (82%) despite a relatively slow absorption rate.", 
    "13": "An incident is reported in which 2 intravenous drug abusers died as the result of uncontrolled experimentation with intravenous injection of the common anti-hypertensive and anti-anginal drug Nifedipine (Adalat t.m. Bayer), probably in mistake for the commonly abused short-acting benzodiazepine drug Temazepam. Large quantities of Nifedipine were identified in the blood of both decreased men by gas chromatography. Apart from intense gastric mucosal congestion, pulmonary oedema and general visceral congestion, the autopsy findings were entirely nonspecific. The similarity in colour, shape and texture between capsules of Nifedipine and those of Temazepam is likely to have prompted the mistake.", 
    "14": "The disposition of alprazolam in 16 young healthy volunteers (eight females and eight males) was investigated. All volunteers were given a 1 mg dose of alprazolam. Dose/kg was 13.3 micrograms/kg (SD +/- 0.89 micrograms/kg) on average for male volunteers and 17.5 micrograms/kg (SD +/- 1.84 micrograms/kg) for the female volunteers. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated separately for both sexes in order to detect possible gender-dependent differences. The elimination rate constant (beta) for alprazolam proved to be significantly higher in the female population 0.067 hr-1 vs. 0.053 hr-1 (p = 0.03). The closely related parameters, elimination half-life (t1/2) and clearance (Cl) were also significantly different. The total area under the serum concentration curve (AUCtot), maximum serum concentration (cmax) and volume of distribution (Vd) were not significantly different. AUCtot corrected for differences in dose/kg was on the other hand significantly higher in males (p = 0.003) while cmax corrected in the same manner was not.", 
    "15": "The memory enhancing properties of sabeluzole were evaluated in two experimental paradigms in rats. First, we determined the protective action of sabeluzole against a chlordiazepoxide-induced impairment of habituation. Sabeluzole (5 or 25 mg/kg, SC) was administered 1 h before and chlordiazepoxide (20 mg/kg, SC) immediately after the acquisition session. In the retention session 72 h later, chlordiazepoxide-treated animals displayed higher locomotor and rearing activities and this effect was blocked by pretreatment with sabeluzole. The results suggest that sabeluzole prevented the amnesic effect of chlordiazepoxide. The second paradigm was a social recognition test in which the behaviour toward a familiar or a novel conspecific was investigated. Time spent in social investigation and time spent sniffing of scent traces left on the floor was estimated during exposure of an adult to a juvenile male rat. Sabeluzole (25 mg/kg, SC) was injected into the adults immediately after the first exposure. Reexposure to the same or a novel juvenile was performed 120 min later. In contrast to control, sabeluzole-treated animals showed a significant reduction in social investigation during the second exposure to the same juvenile. Time spent sniffing the floor was significantly decreased in sabeluzole-treated males. Since there was no effect on investigation of a novel juvenile, results suggest that sabeluzole-treated rats are able to remember longer the individual characteristics of juvenile rat obtained through olfactory cues.", 
    "16": "The effects of cigarette smoking on the electroencephalogram (EEG) of smokers were examined in a study involving both task and no-task conditions. Non-smoking subjects were employed as controls. In light inhaling smokers, (depth of inhalation inferred from pre- to post-smoking changes in tidal breath carbon monoxide), smoking was found to attenuate EEG activity in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands, as well as facilitate behavioral performance. For theta, the attenuation was lateralized over the right frontal cerebral hemisphere. In deep inhaling smokers, smoking produced a symmetrical central midline increase in beta2 magnitude, an EEG effect that in the benzodiazepine literature is associated with anxiety relief.", 
    "17": "The effects of benzodiazepine drugs and the role of their recognition site, the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor, in acute glucoprivic stress are not known. In the present study, the effects of acute glucoprivation were examined in ten healthy human subjects. Glucoprivation was induced by infusion of the glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), at doses sufficient (50 mg/kg) to competitively inhibit glucose metabolism. In addition, the effects of the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam (1.5 mg) on the 2DG-induced stress response was assessed. 2DG produced significant elevations in plasma cortisol (P = 0.0001) and glucose (P = 0.0003) levels. Alprazolam pretreatment attenuated the 2DG-related cortisol elevations (P = 0.05) but did not effect 2DG-induced glucose increases. In addition, 2DG caused significant increases in hunger (P = 0.01) and thirst (P = 0.001), and alprazolam significantly blunted both of these responses. Lastly, 2DG had significant effects on heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and body temperature (P less than 0.05). Alprazolam did not effect these physiologic indices. The significance of these data for the mechanisms involved in acute glucoprivic stress are examined and the implications of the data for the pathophysiology of affective illness and eating disorders are discussed.", 
    "18": "Fifteen patients with endogenous unipolar and bipolar depression were treated with imipramine and, if necessary, one of benzodiazepine or neuroleptic. Total serum concentrations of imipramine (IMI) and its active metabolite desipramine (DMI) were measured in steady-state by FPIA method . Severity of depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. IMI + DMI serum concentration monitoring appeared to be useful in every case. It helped to arrive more quickly at the optimal dosage, confirmed the suspicion of overdosage or noncompliance. In nonresponders group, it helped with the earlier decision of changing brands of tricyclic antidepressant or it contributed to intensify the diagnostic process which detected the additional pathology.", 
    "19": "Concern about persistent benzodiazepine use should be informed by data about reasons for such use. Consecutive long term alprazolam users (n = 25) admitted to an advertised outpatient program for discontinuation were characterized with respect to alprazolam use patterns and lifetime and current Axis I and II disorders. Patient characteristics were: females 50 percent; mean age, 46 +/- 12 yrs; prior medication use--benzodiazepines, 47 percent, antidepressants, 23 percent; median duration of use 104 +/- 96 wks; median daily dose, 0.5 mg; continued effectiveness of alprazolam 50 percent. Over the duration of use patients shifted their initial pattern of use from as prescribed to a self-controlled \"as required\" basis (p less than .05). Interviews using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) yielded diagnoses of DSM-III-R alprazolam dependence in all patients plus at least one additional psychiatric diagnosis in 65 percent (Axis I 65%; Axis II 39%). Most persistent alprazolam use does not represent abuse or addiction as usually understood. These data are most consistent with the interpretation that alprazolam is the most recent benzodiazepine used by patients to help control clinically important psychopathology and that most users make efforts to control or stop use.", 
    "20": "Nerve growth cones, the motile tips of growing neurites, are closely related to the exact pathway finding, and their roles for synaptogenesis have been proposed to be modified by some neurotransmitters. In the present study, to clarify the expression and the ontogeny of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in growth cones, growth cone membranes from fetal and neonatal rat forebrain were isolated, and muscarinic receptors in growth cone membrane were pharmacologically characterized, by using the [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate as a labeled ligand. The specific binding sites for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate had already been detected in growth cone membrane on embryonic day (E)17 (Bmax = 557 fmol/mg protein: KD = 19.7 pM) and gradually increased in amount without significant changes in the KD values from E17 to postnatal day (P)5. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites in growth cone membrane were several times higher than that in the P2-fraction-derived membranes, and in perinuclear membranes. Competitive inhibition studies showed that the proportion of high-affinity sites for pirenzepine (M1-subtype) to total [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites in growth cone membrane was significantly lower than that in adult synaptic plasma membranes. In contrast, the proportion of high-affinity sites for AF-DX 116 (M2-subtype) was significantly higher than that in adult synaptic plasma membranes (E17 growth cone membrane: M1, 29.5%; M2, 56.9%; adult synaptic plasma membrane: M1, 63.6%, M2, 5.9%). Electron micrographic examination revealed that there were no significant morphological differences among growth cone particle fractions at the developmental stages which we examined, and that mature synaptic elements did not contaminate the growth cone particle fractions. Biochemical examination by electrophoresis and the phosphorylation study of the growth cone particle fractions showed that the protein composition and the phosphoprotein pattern did not change markedly during these stages. Our results suggest that muscarinic receptors were expressed and more concentrated in growth cone membrane than in other membrane portions from perinatal rat forebrain, and that they may play some role in the axonal guidance in growth cone via receptor subtype-specific signal transduction mechanisms.", 
    "21": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with acute, subacute and chronic liver failure, involving increased neural inhibition by activation of the GABA/benzodiazepine inhibitory neurotransmitter system. Improvement by GABA and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists as well as by chloride ionophore blockers has been shown in animal experiments. Recent reports indicate that flumazenil may improve hepatic encephalopathy in man. To date 46 episodes of HE in 41 patients have been treated with flumazenil with a short term success rate of 72%. Most of the patients were screened for exogenous benzodiazepines and found negative. These interesting observations should now be investigated in a randomised double-blind controlled study in patients with HE to evaluate the efficiency of this therapy.", 
    "22": "The effect of midazolam on the induction dose-response curve for alfentanil was studied in non-premedicated ASA physical status I or II patients. The response to the verbal command was used as an end point of anaesthesia. Dose-response curves for midazolam, alfentanil, and their combination were determined with a probit procedure, and compared with algebraic (fractional) analysis of drug interaction. Interaction between midazolam and alfentanil was found to be synergistic (supra-additive). The results suggest that the use of this combination is advantageous not only because it helps to achieve different anaesthetic goals with specific drugs (a benzodiazepine for unconsciousness and an opioid for blockade of the responses to noxious stimulation), but also because its components are complementary for unconsciousness.", 
    "23": "This retrospective study examines data from 55 patients sedated in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with midazolam. Midazolam sedation was initiated with a bolus of 0.25 mg.kg-1 followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4-4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Physiological and metabolic parameters, infusion rates, duration, and sedation scores were monitored. Midazolam infusions were effective in sedating all the children studied during all or part of their PICU admission. The median duration of sedation was 74 h with a range of 4 to 1272 h. Haemodynamics were unchanged. Of the patients 46% were effectively alimented by the enteral route, and enteral alimentation was successful in all patients in whom it was attempted. Unassisted ventilation occurred in 44% of the patients during infusion. Oxygen consumption was 28% lower than in the control. Disadvantages of midazolam infusion have included inability to sedate during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and development of acute tolerance.", 
    "24": "The haemodynamic effects of midazolam or propofol, with a low dose of fentanyl, were studied during induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation in 20 patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery. This study demonstrates that both drugs induce important modifications of haemodynamic parameters undesirable in elderly, high-risk patients.", 
    "25": "The potential usefulness of cholinergic replacement therapy for Alzheimer disease (AD) is dependent upon retention of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors and their transduction mechanisms long after the degeneration of cholinergic nerves. The receptors most clearly associated with cholinergic cerebral excitation are m1 muscarinic receptors, which work via a G protein to activate phospholipase C. The ability of these receptors to couple to their associated G protein was assessed in the middle temporal gyrus of postmortem brains from persons with and without AD. A low concentration of [3H]-pirenzepine (1 nM) was used to label m1 receptors preferentially. The affinity of the agonist, oxotremorine-M, for labeled receptors and the ability of these receptors to couple with G protein were assessed by competition between the agonist and 1 nM [3H]-pirenzepine in the presence and absence of guanine nucleotide. Brain tissue from 7 patients with AD and five age-matched controls showed very similar levels of labeled receptors, agonist affinities for the high- and low-affinity states of m1 receptors, and guanine nucleotide-sensitive high-affinity binding. It is concluded that the coupling of m1 receptors to G protein is adequate to permit responses to exogenous muscarinic drugs in AD.", 
    "26": "After 21 days of treatment with diazepam (2 mg/kg/day IP) rats were tested 24 h after the last injection in the social interaction and elevated plus-maze tests of anxiety. Compared with control-treated rats, they showed significant decreases in social interaction, in the % numbers of entries onto open arms of the plus-maze and in the % of time spent on the open arms, indicating an anxiogenic response on withdrawal from diazepam. Buspirone (200 micrograms/kg SC) significantly increased social interaction in diazepam withdrawn rats and in the plus-maze also this dose significantly reversed the anxiogenic effects of diazepam withdrawal. Buspirone (400 micrograms/kg SC) was without effect in the plus-maze, but buspirone (800 micrograms/kg SC) significantly decreased the % of time spent on open arms in control-treated rats, indicating an anxiogenic effect. In the social interaction test buspirone (800 micrograms/kg SC) was without significant effect. The contrasting effects of the 200 and 800 micrograms/kg doses are discussed in terms of the pre- and post-synaptic actions of buspirone. The findings are consistent with earlier proposals that the increased anxiety during benzodiazepine withdrawal is at least partly caused by an increased release of hippocampal 5-HT.", 
    "27": "The compartmental distribution of diazepam (DZ) and nordiazepam (ND) and their metabolites was studied in DZ and ND dependent dogs. The levels of DZ, and ND and their metabolites were determined during the last week of stabilization in the extraneuronal brain space, in brain tissue, in plasma and in CSF. In these studies dependent dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital and microdialysis probes were inserted bilaterally into the parietal cortex and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Microdialysis probes were also used to determine the unbound parent drugs and their metabolites in plasma. The brain-plasma distribution of total ND and oxazepam (OX) is about equal in ND dependent dogs but in DZ dependent dogs total ND and OX are about 2-fold higher in brain than in plasma. The levels of DZ, ND, and OX in the extraneuronal brain space are similar to their unbound levels in plasma. These data suggest that the concentration of free benzodiazepines in plasma is a good approximation of the concentration in the vicinity of the membrane receptors in the dependent dogs.", 
    "28": "This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its main metabolite, 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam glucoronide, during long-term i.v. infusion in 39 mechanically ventilated ICU patients of whom 6 were in acute renal failure (ARF). The mean infusion rate of midazolam was similar (9.4 vs 8.7 mg/h) in the control patients and those with ARF. The renal clearance of 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam glucuronide was much lower in the ARF group than in the control group (3.9 vs 136 ml/min). Consequently, its plasma elimination half-life after discontinuation was also greatly prolonged, but this shouldn't cause very prolonged sedative effects since this metabolite is much less active than the parent drug. However, the half-life of midazolam itself was also significantly longer in patients with ARF than in the control group (13.2 vs 7.6 h). Apparently, this was caused by a combination of a slightly lower total clearance and a higher volume of distribution. Therefore, regular reassessment of the degree of sedation and appropriate adaptation of the infusion rate of midazolam are recommended in ICU patients with ARF.", 
    "29": "In young adults rats (5-month-old) d-amphetamine (2 mg/kg/d), administered on a long-term basis via drinking water, caused a moderate reduction in the intake of nutriments, which in part normalized within three weeks. Self-administration of a daily dose of 20 mg per kg diazepam over a period of 26 days led neither to hypodipsia nor to anorexia. Pentylenetetrazol (70 mg/kg/d) primarily produced a hypodipsia. The three drugs did not influence body weight. In 27-month-old rats d-amphetamine and pentylenetetrazol had the same qualitative effects. Intake of nutriments and the development of body weight were influenced more strongly than in young rats. Diazepam also had a marked effect in old animals. Nootropics (piracetam, pyrithinol, hydergin, centrophenoxin, aniracetam) had no effects on the parameters observed. When the agents were given in combination in both age groups the nootropic piracetam (230 mg/kg/d) weakened the effects induced by d-amphetamine, pentylenetetrazol or diazepam alone. The benzodiazepine, however, enhanced the loss of body weight and fluid intake in old rats caused by the stimulant or analeptic, whereas food intake remained unaffected. The results support the hypothesis that an organism's adaptivity to external and internal stimuli is reduced in later life. The behavior of young and old rats in the open field was not affected by any drug medication.",

Proglumide antagonizes the action of CCK-8 and of its analogue. 3. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate whether proglumide would affect the potent hypnotic action of flunitrazepam in rats. 4. The association of proglumide with flunitrazepam suppress the increase of total sleep time and slow wave sleep seen after flunitrazepam alone. Proglumide alone has no effect on sleep stages.

Like the better known chorea minor it shows extrapyramidal symptoms with involuntary movements, lack of coordination, slurred speech and psychic disorders. The neurological state is normal except for a loss of muscle tone. The symptoms most commonly begin in the first trimester of pregnancy and usually resolve spontaneously after 2-3 months. The maternal mortality lies below 1%. In the case of subjectively disturbing symptoms anticonvulsive and sedative therapy with benzodiazepine or neuroleptics may be indicated. Etiological factors including rheumatic fever, chorea minor, hormonal, psychic and autoimmune disorders are discussed. Elective termination of the pregnancy is not indicated. The presented case report shows a chorea-like situation beginning in the ninth week of pregnancy.", 
    "32": "Psychiatrists as well as general practitioners frequently prescribe psychotropic drugs (tranquilizers such as benzodiazepines and increasingly low-dose long-acting neuroleptics) to treat functional organic complaints. We are interested in finding out the psychodynamics in the doctor-patient relationship that determine whether the doctor puts more emphasis on eliminating symptoms by prescribing psychotropic drugs or on solving the underlying conflicts by psychotherapy. Furthermore we describe some interactions which are of importance for illustrating whether drugs are effective or lead to side effects.", 
    "33": "Diazepam and its main degradation product 2-methyl-amino-5-chlorobenzophenon (MACB) were quantitatively determined by HPLC and spectrophotometry in one- to ten-years-old diazepam injections. The content of diazepam was within the specifications in all the samples. Not more than 1.5% degradation of diazepam was found after ten years.", 
    "34": "We have investigated the effect of piracetam on photoparoxysmal responses in 3 patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. With doses of up to 10 g/day, elimination of photoparoxysmal responses was achieved in all 3 patients. Corresponding to EEG improvement, the clinical performance improved slightly in 2 patients and definitely in 1 patient when piracetam was added to their medication of valproate and clonazepam. According to our data, medical treatment of myoclonus with piracetam is justified particularly in myoclonus of cortical origin.", 
    "35": "The effects of 4 non-ulcer drugs and the M1-antagonist pirenzepine on the nocturnal intragastric pH were investigated in 12 healthy volunteers. We tested single doses of pirenzepine (100 mg), Chlorprothixene (30 mg), clonidine (75 micrograms), ketotifen (3 mg) and nifedipine (30 mg) in an randomized, single-blind, cross-over study. The nocturnal intraluminal pH is significantly elevated not only by pirenzepine but also by the other substances. As expected pirenzepine (mean nocturnal pH = 2.49 +/- 0.22) shows the most distinct effect, nifedipine (mean nocturnal pH = 1.72 +/- 0.20) the most sparsely effect. The other drugs are nearly half as effective as pirenzepine. The acid suppressive side effect of the non-ulcer remedies is considered to be important for the treatment of ulcer patients with concomitant diseases.", 
    "36": "Twenty-nine patients, ranked ASA 1 or 2, scheduled for diagnostic gastroduodenal fibroscopy were randomly allocated into three treatment groups: intranasal midazolam (IN) 0.15 mg.kg-1; intramuscular midazolam (IM) 0.15 mg.kg-1, and placebo (P). Sedation and the fibroscopy were all carried out by the same anaesthetist and fibroscopist. Efficiency and tolerance of the method were assessed by monitoring the heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), the degrees of sedation, anxiety, and anterograde as well as retrograde amnesia. The patient's and endoscopist's reactions were also considered. Patients in group P were older than those of the other two groups (p less than 0.01). Sedation was more important and patients less anxious in groups IN and IM than in group P. Three patients in group IM had retrograde amnesia. There were no significant differences between the degrees of anterograde amnesia in the three groups. At no time during the study were there any significant differences in SpO2 between and within groups. Four out of the 9 patients in group P had a bad opinion of their experience, as compared with two out of the 20 in the midazolam groups; the difference was not statistically significant. Three hours after the procedure, all patients were fully awake. Intranasal administration of midazolam therefore seemed to be an interesting alternative for gastroduodenal fibroscopy, because it was simple, non traumatic, well tolerated, and did not result in arterial desaturation.", 
    "37": "Benzodiazepines are known to cause central nervous system and centrally mediated cardiovascular depression. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil has been shown to antagonize benzodiazepine-induced central nervous system depression. We report a case in which cardiovascular depression secondary to benzodiazepine use was reversed by this agent.", 
    "38": "The purpose of the study was to compare the cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic responses to exercise of highly endurance trained subjects after 3 different nights i.e. a baseline night, a partial sleep deprivation of 3 h in the middle of the night and a 0.25-mg triazolam-induced sleep. Sleep-waking chronobiology and endurance performance capacity were taken into account in the choice of the subjects. Seven subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer for a 10-min warm-up, then for 20 min at a steady exercise intensity (equal to the intensity corresponding to 75% of the predetermined maximal oxygen consumption) followed by an increased intensity until exhaustion. The night with 3 h sleep loss was accompanied by a greater number of periods of wakefulness (P less than 0.01) and fewer periods of stage 2 sleep (P less than 0.05) compared with the results recorded during the baseline night. Triazolam-induced sleep led to an increase in stage 2 sleep (P less than 0.05), a decrease in wakefulness (P less than 0.05) and in stage 3 sleep (P less than 0.05). After partial sleep deprivation, there were statistically significant increases in heart rate (P less than 0.05) and ventilation (P less than 0.05) at submaximal exercise compared with results obtained after the baseline night. Both variables were also significantly enhanced at maximal exercise, while the peak oxygen consumption (VO2) dropped (P less than 0.05) even though the maximal sustained exercise intensity was not different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The solubility of midazolam is less than 0.1 mg ml-1 at neutral pH and it increases considerably in acidic media. A pKa value of 6.04 at 24 +/- 1 degree C was calculated from the solubility data. In acidic media midazolam is reversibly converted to the corresponding benzophenone (open-ring form). The extent of this reaction was investigated by assaying the two compounds simultaneously by UV spectrophotometry with multicomponent software. The structure of the benzophenone derivative was verified by IR, MS and 1H and 13C NMR spectrometry.", 
    "40": "Fentanyl/diazepam anesthesia is an appropriate combination for surgical operations on the guinea pig, since it ensures definitive anesthesia and analgesia without respiratory depression. Comparative investigations with pentobarbital and urethane were carried out to check their applicability for electrocochleographic recordings. We found that fentanyl/diazepam combination anesthesia is more suitable for electrocochleographic investigations than pentobarbital. We were thereby able to prove that pentobarbital has an attenuating effect on electrocochleographic recordings in contrast to the findings reported in the available literature. For this reason, and because the lowest rates of animal morbidity occurred with fentanyl/diazepam, this combination anesthesia should be used preferentially for electrophysiological experiments in guinea pigs.", 
    "41": "Dose-dependent effects of intravenously administered lorazepam on psychophysiological activity during rest and mental stress were studied in order to examine differential responses to doses which may induce anxiolysis or sedation. In a double-blind randomized cross-over study, nine male volunteers participated in a placebo and a lorazepam session, during which the subjects repeatedly performed a 10-min version of the Stroop Color Word Test (CWT), with 10 min of rest between the CWTs. Lorazepam was administered before each rest period in increasing doses of 0.0, 0.6, 0.13, 0.25 and 0.5 mg (total cumulative dose: 0.94 mg). Heart rate showed a dose-dependent decrease during rest with an ED50 of 0.13 mg lorazepam, while lorazepam had no effect on the cardiovascular and plasma catecholamine response magnitudes to the CWT. Subjective fatigue and reaction time increased significantly after 0.94 mg lorazepam, while at the same dose vigor decreased; state anxiety after the CWT was not influenced by lorazepam. These data show differential effects of lorazepam on cardiovascular, biochemical and psychological function. While heart rate was suppressed at low doses during rest and reaction time and subjective fatigue increased at doses which induced sedation, state anxiety and physiological response patterns to the CWT were not influenced by lorazepam.", 
    "42": "This study investigated the antiemetic activity of two different acute antiemesis regimens in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Seventy-four patients were treated with high-dose metoclopramide, dexamethasone and lorazepam (MDL) and 71 patients received high-dose alizapride, dexamethasone and lorazepam (ADL). Complete protection from vomiting was 50% in MDL-treated patients as compared with 30% in the ADL arm (p = 0.04). Incidence of delayed emesis was assessed in the first 82 patients accrued for the 120 h postcisplatin, being 69 and 60% in MDL and ADL, respectively.", 
    "43": "Lorazepam, dexamethasone and high-dose metoclopramide were given to 54 patients to prevent emesis induced by cisplatin (50-120 mg/m2) on day 1, while prochlorperazine and dexamethasone were administered on days 2 and 3 for control of delayed emesis. Nausea and emesis were recorded from day 1 to day 8. This combination was well tolerated. Prevention on day 1 was complete for 72% of patients and satisfactory (less than or equal to 2 emeses on day 1) in 85%. From days 2 to 8, no emesis, less than or equal to 2 and greater than 2 episodes occurred in 70, 11 and 19%, respectively. Overall control (days 1-8) was complete in 55.5% and satisfactory (less than or equal to 2 emeses on day 1 and/or less than or equal to 2 emeses from days 2 to 8) in 74%. Delayed emesis started on days 2-5. Mean duration was 2.6 days. Delayed nausea or emesis were more frequent when emesis occurred on day 1. Based on data previously reported and on these observations, better ways to prevent delayed events are discussed. Further trials must record systematically delayed side effects.", 
    "44": "There are no previous reports on parasomnias (sleep behavior disorders) affecting patients on intensive care units (ICUs). During 8 years of clinical practice, we evaluated over 200 adults with complaints of injurious, sleep-related behaviors, 20 of whom had ICU admissions while their parasomnias had been active and generally undiagnosed/untreated. Mean age during ICU confinement was 62.8 (+/- SD 13.1) years; 85.0% (17/20) were males. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical examinations along with extensive polysomnographic and audiovisual monitoring (electrooculogram, 9 channel EEG with paper speeds of 15 and 30 mm/sec, electromyogram [submental and 4 limbs], EKG, airflow). The polysomnographic studies were diagnostic for the REM sleep behavior disorder (vigorous dream-enactment during rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) in 85.0% (17/20) of patients, and for night terrors/sleepwalking in 15.0% (3/20). Three groups of parasomnia-ICU relationships were identified: i) Parasomnias originating in ICUs, stroke-induced (n = 3); ii) Admission to ICUs resulting from parasomnia-induced injuries: C2 odontoid process fracture and C3 spinous process fracture with severe concussion (n = 2); iii) Parasomnias in patients admitted to ICUs for various other medical problems (n = 15). Physicians should be thus alerted about the possibility of injurious, but usually treatable, parasomnias in ICU patients.", 
    "45": "Twenty-eight patients (12 M, 16 F) with insomnia were treated with nitrazepam 5 mg/d and oxazepam 25 mg/d, each for 11 days, in a double-blind crossover comparison with placebo. Half the patients received nitrazepam in the first drug period, and oxazepam in the second and the other half followed the contrary sequence. Both nitrazepam and oxazepam were found to be effective in inducing sleep and increasing sleep quality. No effects on dreaming or adverse effects were found. Nitrazepam did influence the frequency of awakening, but only in the second drug period. In the first period it reduced self-waking. It is concluded that both nitrazepam and oxazepam were effective in inducing sleep and in improving sleep quality.", 
    "46": "Several classes of non-nucleotide analogues (i.e. TIBO and HEPT derivatives) have been identified that specifically interact with the reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These derivatives inhibit the replication of HIV-1 in various cell lines, including peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, at concentrations that are 10,000- to 100,000-fold lower than the cytotoxic concentrations. At the HIV-1 RT level, they appear to interact with a specific allosteric \"TIBO\" site, which may be functionally and also structurally associated with the substrate binding site. The TIBO and TIBO-like compounds are orally bioavailable. In vivo they sustain plasma drug levels that are well above the concentrations required to inhibit virus replication in vitro.", 
    "47": "This study performed on 6 conscious cats with chronic pancreatic fistulas was designed to determine the role of cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) in stimulation of pancreatic secretion in this species. Pancreatic response to GRP infused intravenously in graded doses appears to be mediated predominantly by CCK because a CCK receptor antagonist, L-364,718, abolished this response. Also, gastrin appears to mediate in part the secretory response to GRP because blockade of gastrin receptors by L-365,260, given at the dose that completely abolished the pancreatic response to exogenous gastrin, caused a significant reduction in the bombesin-induced pancreatic secretion. CCK and partly gastrin appear to mediate the postprandial pancreatic secretion in cats as the administration of L-364,718 and L-365,260 inhibited this secretion by over 90 and 30%, respectively. In contrast, GRP does not seem to contribute to food-induced pancreatic secretory stimulation, because the blockade of GRP receptors using novel bombesin/GRP antagonist (RC-3100) failed to affect this secretion. We conclude that CCK and partly gastrin, but not GRP, play an essential role in the postprandial pancreatic secretion.", 
    "48": "AP159 [N-cyclohexyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo(b)thieno(2,3c)pyridine]-3- carboamide,hydrochloride) showed clear anti-conflict activity in rats in the absence of effects on muscle relaxation, potentiation of anesthesia (in mice) or anticonvulsant activity (in mice). This anti-conflict effect was antagonized by treatment with Ro15-1788. By contrast with the deficits produced by diazepam, AP159 did not impair passive avoidance. The latter drug also improved scopolamine-induced amnesia in the same task. AP159 did not inhibit 3H-flunitrazepam binding, but potently inhibited 3H-8OH-DPAT binding. This compound increased serotonin and 5HIAA content of the midbrain raphe nuclei and of the amygdala centralis. AP159 has been shown to be a novel non-BZP anxiolytic agent with no side effects in laboratory animals; it could be a clinically effective anxiolytic agent.", 
    "49": "The present study was designed to evaluate the possible interaction of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) with the GABAA receptor complex in the rat cerebral cortex. To this purpose we studied the effect of in vitro addition and in vivo administration of GHB on the biochemical parameters currently used to evaluate the function of the GABAergic system. In vitro addition of increasing concentrations of GHB failed to modify [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) binding and the modulatory action of GABA on this binding. Moreover, unlike diazepam, GHB did not modify in vitro both muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to rat cerebral cortex. In vivo administration of sedative and hypnotic doses of GHB (300-750 mg/kg IP) failed to induce in 60 min any significant change in the [35S]TBPS binding to unwashed cortical membranes. Moreover, GHB also failed to antagonize the increase in [35S]TBPS binding (+55%) induced by isoniazid (350 mg/kg SC). In contrast, at the highest doses used, this drug completely antagonized the seizure activity induced by isoniazid. In conclusion, our data show that GHB fails to alter the function of the GABAA/benzodiazepine/ionophore receptor complex in the rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "50": "Compared to traditional neuroleptics, most of the new antipsychotics are characterized by a low extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) liability and varying antipsychotic efficacy. This topic is reviewed for four principal classes of new, established, and potential antipsychotics: (1) Antipsychotics such as sulpiride and remoxipride that block a subgroup of dopamine (DA) D2/D3 receptors produce a relatively low level of side effects, including EPS, and have an antipsychotic effect equal to or slightly weaker than traditional neuroleptics. D1 antagonists demonstrate a low level of EPS in primates and may prove to be a valuable new type of antipsychotic drug. (2) Theoretically, partial D2 agonists have the advantage of producing few or no EPS and a specific beneficial effect in negative symptoms, but as yet the expectations have not been fulfilled. (3) Nondopamine drugs such as serotonin (5HT1) agonists, 5HT2 antagonists, 5HT3 antagonists, and gamma-amino-butyric-acid-A (GABA-A) benzodiazepine agonists have anxiolytic, antidepressant, antiaggressive, and maybe antiparkinsonian effects and may play an adjunctive role in the treatment of schizophrenia. 5HT3 antagonists (e.g., ondansetron), partial benzodiazepine agonists, and partial glutamate agonists may prove to be effective antipsychotics. (4) Antipsychotics such as clozapine and risperidone, which affect D2/D3 receptors as well as 5HT, alpha 1, and/or D1 receptors appear to have the most pronounced antipsychotic effect.", 
    "51": "Rat superior cervical ganglia infected with herpes virus suis (pseudorabies virus) display a spontaneous bursting activity of still unknown origin. Previous intracellular recordings from the ganglionic neurons combined with pharmacological studies showed that the postganglionic action potentials are induced by acetylcholine release spontaneously from the preganglionic nerve. In this study we investigated whether the acetylcholine release is caused by mechanisms which are dependent on action potentials spontaneously generated on the preganglionic nerve or by mechanisms which occur without any changes in the excitability of presynaptic fibers. Simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings from the ganglion cells and from the preganglionic nerve, respectively, were performed 32-38 h after the inoculation of herpes virus suis (strain Aujeszky) into the anterior chamber of one eye of the rat. Tetrodotoxin, well known to prevent the generation of action potentials by blocking the fast sodium channels, completely and reversibly abolished, whereas the potassium channel blockers 4-aminopyridine and apamin, enhanced the spontaneous, bursting activity at pre- and postsynaptic levels. The nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium abolished the postsynaptic discharges and reduced the preganglionic activity by 50%. Pre- and postsynaptic electrical activities were suppressed in low calcium Krebs' solution, demonstrating that extracellular calcium is required not only for acetylcholine release but also for triggering the presynaptic action potentials. It is concluded that in the infected ganglia the spontaneous acetylcholine release is due to the generation of action potentials in the preganglionic nerve. Voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels contribute to the presynaptic electrogenesis, while the latter appears to be damped by the activation of voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium channels. Possible factors as well as mechanisms inducing such an increase in excitability are discussed.", 
    "52": "The effects of bombesin, gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) on amylase secretion from the isolated rat pancreatic acini and on DNA synthesis (as biochemical indicator of trophic action) in the pancreas have been examined in 48-hour fasted and 16-hour refed rats with and without administration of specific receptor antagonists for bombesin, gastrin and CCK. Studies on the isolated rat acini revealed that bombesin, gastrin and CCK-8 all showed the same efficacy in their ability to stimulate amylase release. RC-3095, bombesin pseudo-peptide antagonizing bombesin receptors, was effective only in suppressing the amylase response to bombesin but not to gastrin or CCK. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists for gastrin (L-365,260) and for CCK (L-364,718) showed higher efficacy in the inhibition of amylase release induced by pentagastrin and CCK, respectively, but failed to affect that induced by bombesin. These peptides administered 3 times daily for 48 h in fasted rats increased the rate of DNA synthesis as measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. The blockade of bombesin receptors abolished the DNA synthesis induced only by bombesin but not by gastrin or CCK. The blockade of gastrin receptors by L-365,260 suppressed the DNA synthesis induced by gastrin while the antagonism of CCK receptors by L-364,718 was effective only against CCK. Refeeding of 48-hour fasting rats strongly enhanced DNA synthesis which was significantly reduced by blocking only the CCK receptors (with L-364,718), but not the bombesin (with RC-3095) or gastrin receptors (with L-365,260).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Because of its apparent effectiveness in detecting non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic agents, a recently introduced conflict procedure in pigeons was used to evaluate possible anti-punishment activity of various N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. Punished responding was significantly increased by competitive NMDA antagonists (CPP, CGS 19755), but not by noncompetitive NMDA antagonists acting at either the ion channel (PCP, ketamine, MK-801), the glycine site (kynurenic acid, 7-chlorokynurenic acid, ACPC), or the polyamine site (ifenprodil) of the NMDA receptor complex; the proposed glutamate antagonist, riluzole, was also ineffective.", 
    "54": "Classical transmitters are present in all phyla that have been studied; however, our detailed understanding of the process of neurotransmission in these phyla is patchy and has centred on those neurotransmitter receptor mechanisms which are amenable to study with the tools available at the time, for example, high-affinity ligands, tissues with high density of receptor protein, suitable electrophysiological recording systems. Studies also clearly show that many neurones exhibit co-localization of classical transmitters and neuropeptides. However, the physiological implications of this co-localization have yet to be elucidated in the vast majority of examples. The application of molecular biological techniques to the study of neurotransmitter receptors (to date mainly in vertebrates) is contributing to our understanding of the evolution of these proteins. Striking similarities in the structure of ligand-gated receptors have been revealed. Thus, although ligand-gated receptors differ markedly in terms of the endogenous ligands they recognize and the ion channels that they gate, the structural similarities suggest a strong evolutionary relationship. Pharmacological differences also exist between receptors that recognize the same neurotransmitter but in different phyla, and this may also be exploited to further the understanding of structure-function relationships for receptors. Thus, for instance, some invertebrate GABA receptors are similar to mammalian GABAA receptors but lack a modulatory site operated by benzodiazepines. Knowledge of the structure and subunit composition of these receptors and comparison with those that have already been elucidated for the mammalian nervous system might indicate the functional importance of certain amino acid residues or receptor subunits. These differences could also be exploited in the development of new agents to control agrochemical pests and parasites of medical importance. The study of the pharmacology of receptor proteins for neurotransmitters in invertebrates, together with the application of biochemical and molecular biological techniques to elucidate the structure of these molecules, is now gathering momentum. For certain receptors, e.g. the nicotinic receptor, we can expect to have fundamental information on the function of this receptor at the molecular level in both invertebrates and vertebrates in the near future.", 
    "55": "Cholinergic muscarinic systems are involved in the regulation of female sexual behavior in rats and hamsters. This series of experiments was designed to determine whether sexual behavior in female rats is controlled preferentially by one of the traditional muscarinic receptor subtypes. Intraventricular infusion of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (10 micrograms bilaterally) which binds with high affinity to both M1 and M2 subtypes inhibited sexual behavior, as indicated by the incidence of lordosis, in ovariectomized rats treated with estrogen and progesterone. In contrast, the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine failed to reduce the incidence of lordosis following intraventricular infusion (10 to 80 micrograms bilaterally). Biochemical analyses revealed that intraventricular infusion of scopolamine (10 micrograms bilaterally) inhibited both M1 and M2 binding in brain tissues while intraventricular infusion of pirenzepine (10 micrograms bilaterally) completely inhibited M1 binding without affecting M2 binding. Intraventricular infusions of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (10 micrograms bilaterally), the cholinergic agonist carbachol (1 microgram bilaterally), and the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M (0.1 micrograms bilaterally) activated lordosis in ovariectomized females primed with low doses of estrogen. In contrast, the putative M1 agonist McN-A-343 failed to significantly increase lordosis following intraventricular infusions (1, 10, 20 micrograms bilaterally). According to biochemical results, the ability of these agents to activate lordosis in female rats was related to their affinities for M2 binding sites not M1 binding sites. In a final experiment, estrogen treatment of ovariectomized rats did not alter muscarinic subtype binding in several brain areas as measured by the M1-selective ligand [3H] pirenzepine and the M2-selective ligand [3H] oxotremorine-M. The results of these experiments confirm that muscarinic systems contribute to the regulation of lordosis in female rats and indicate that M2 binding sites rather than M1 binding sites may be a critical component of this regulation.", 
    "56": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors are heterooligomeric proteins with an apparent high degree of variability in the specific assembly of their component subunits. Although the precise nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of many of the various GABAA receptor subunits are known, the exact quaternary structures of the native receptors are unknown. Recombinant expression of receptors with different combinations of subunits produces a variety of structurally different receptors with varying Cl- channel function and sensitivities to modulation by drugs such as benzodiazepines. Differences in the regional distribution of GABAA receptor subtypes in brain, coupled with the observed differences in the relative affinities of various anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs among these receptor subtypes, suggests a new strategy for drug development that is the targeting of drugs to specific subpopulations of GABAA receptors. This is a review of the recent striking progress in understanding the heterogeneity of the GABAA receptors and its possible significance.", 
    "57": "The short-term effects of rat pancreatic duct obstruction were evaluated and compared with those recently reported to follow obstruction of the rabbit pancreatic duct. In both species pancreatic edema and hyperamylasemia are noted, and the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin B is redistributed from the lysosome-enriched to the zymogen granule-enriched subcellular fraction. Theoretically, this redistribution phenomenon might lead to digestive enzyme activation because cathepsin B is known to be capable of activating trypsinogen. The hyperamylasemia and pancreatic edema (but not the cathepsin B redistribution) that follow rat pancreatic duct obstruction were increased by infusion of a submaximally stimulating dose of the cholecystokinin analogue cerulein. Administration of the cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist L-364,718 reduced the hyperamylasemia but did not alter the pancreatic edema or cathepsin B redistribution. These observations indicate that cholecystokinin may modulate some but not all of the effects of duct obstruction. Secretin administration increased the degree of pancreatic edema and had no demonstrable protective effect. The rat duct-obstruction model described in this report may prove particularly useful in future studies designed to clarify the early events underlying the development of acute pancreatitis.", 
    "58": "Various neurophysiological properties of cannabis are described in a review of the literature. The properties of the principal active cannabinoid, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) are described, followed by a review of psychological and neuropsychiatric effects. Cannabis disturbs EEG, decreasing in particular REM sleep time. Cerebral atrophy is not evident, assuming no concurrent drug abuse, but cerebral perfusion is noted to decrease after THC absorption. Endocrine effects have been described in animal studies: inhibiting effects on sex hormone production and thyroid function, and a stimulating action on corticosteroid activity have been observed. These actions are thought to exert themselves at the hypothalamic level. There is also evidence of an effect on prostaglandin metabolism. At the cellular and subcellular level THC acts on membranes of neurones and synaptic vesicles, possibly affecting membrane transport systems. The morphology of the synapse is also altered. THC acts on neurone conduction, stimulating polysynaptic transmission. Various mechanisms of THC activity are considered: via specific lipoprotein receptors, via central benzodiazepine receptors and via opioid receptors. THC also exerts an effect on neurotransmitters: an increase in central cholinergic activity, a mode-rate increase in catecholaminergic activity and effects on the GABA and serotonin systems are postulated.", 
    "59": "Calmodulin is a protein with calcium-dependent binding sites. Binding of calcium ions induces changes in the conformation and activation of many enzymes such as adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase, ATPase. Neuroleptic drugs bind calmodulin. Trifluoperazine has a very high affinity for calmodulin. Tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines also bind calmodulin. Binding of neuroleptics inhibits many biological phenomena such as lymphocyte endocytosis, platelets aggregation. When neuroleptics are administrated chronically, calmodulin could act in regulation of the receptors specially in the drug induced supersensitivity of striatum dopamine receptors. These experiments about the regulation of the receptors mediated by calmodulin have been performed ten years ago and their results were not confirmed later. Moreover, binding of calmodulin is not specific of neuroleptic drugs. The effects of neuroleptics on calmodulin, only observed in vitro or with animals, seem to be mainly related to structural properties of the drugs.", 
    "60": "In 1978 the third largest Swedish city, Malm\u00f6, known to have the highest suicide frequency in the country, was found to have a higher prescription rate (defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants per day) of anxiolytic-hypnotic drugs (AHD) than the country, the corresponding county, other counties, and other cities, including the largest (Stockholm) and second largest (G\u00f6teborg = Gothenburg) cities. Barbiturate prescribing in Malm\u00f6 was 40% higher than in Stockholm and 90% higher than in G\u00f6teborg, and the frequency of suicide due to barbiturates was three-times higher than in G\u00f6teborg. A small proportion (2.4% of all AHD-prescribing doctors) of private practitioners wrote a large percentage (24%) of all AHD prescriptions. Prescription surveillance and an information campaign in Malm\u00f6 were accompanied by a 4-year decrease in AHD prescribing (12%), in AHD abuse (40%), in barbiturate prescribing (45%), and in barbiturate suicides (70%). The total suicide rate was reduced by 25%. There was no corresponding 4-year increase in suicide due to other drugs, or by other means, but after 5 to 7 years there was an increase in suicide by non-pharmacological means. The contribution of benzodiazepines to the frequency of suicide was very small, whereas their contribution to AHD abuse was considerable. In G\u00f6teborg, where no corresponding intervention was carried out, there was also a reduction in barbiturate prescribing (34%) and in barbiturate suicides (45%), but in contrast there was a continuous increase both in overall AHD and benzodiazepine prescribing, surpassing Malm\u00f6 after 5 years. Far from a reduction there was a 7-year increase in the overall frequency of suicide. Apparently, AHD abuse and suicide can be greatly reduced by restricted prescribing of AHD, and this may but need not be accompanied by an increase in suicide by other means. Targeted drug information campaigns may assist in changing prescription patterns and their medical and social impact.", 
    "61": "Alprazolam, adinazolam, and clonazepam share the typical pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines yet are diverse in their pharmacokinetic properties. Alprazolam has an average terminal elimination half-life of 12 hours, whereas adinazolam generates a metabolite responsible for its benzodiazepine effects whose half-life is less than 3 hours. Clonazepam shows a much slower elimination with a half-life of 20 to 80 hours. The rate of decline of plasma benzodiazepine concentration may be an important factor in determining the number of daily doses necessary to maintain optimal anti-panic effects and to minimize rebound anxiety and withdrawal effects. Clonazepam, which has a longer half-life, would be expected to have some advantages over the other drugs. The limited data available do not provide evidence for any substantial advantages of one benzodiazepine over another. The potential disadvantage of the rapid elimination half-life of adinazolam and its metabolite may be offset by formulation in a sustained release capsule. When discontinuing therapy abruptly, a benzodiazepine with a longer half-life may be advantageous; however, when pharmacotherapy is discontinued gradually, the importance of half-life is diminished. Studies of the pharmacodynamics of drug-receptor interactions suggest new approaches to minimizing the adverse effects of discontinuing benzodiazepine therapy. Preliminary data relating plasma alprazolam concentrations to anxiolytic and adverse effects are presented.", 
    "62": "In pediatric intensive care, analgesia and sedation has become increasingly important for newborns as well as prematures in recent years. However, its importance is frequently not well recognized and sedation is confounded with analgesia. In our intensive-care unit (ICU), fentanyl and midazolam have proved to be useful. In newborn and premature infants, fentanyl alone has been sufficient because of its analgesic and sedative action. In a study on 20 newborns and prematures suffering from severe respiratory problems as compared with a historical group that did not receive fentanyl, we could show that in subjects receiving fentanyl, considerably less treatment with sedatives and other analgesics was necessary. Cardiopulmonary tolerance was satisfactory. The highest bilirubin values were reached about 1 day earlier and were slightly higher than those measured in the control group, but oral nutrition could be initiated sooner. In small infants, additional midazolam was given after cardiac surgery. During the first 72 h, we found a correlation between serum levels of midazolam and the depth of sedation; however, after 72 h of medication, the dose had to be raised because of an increase in metabolic clearance. During the concomitant administration of midazolam and fentanyl, significantly less midazolam was needed to achieve appropriate analog-sedation. Prior to the administration of analgesics and sedatives, care should be taken to ensure that circulatory conditions are stable and that there is no hypovolemia, and the drugs must be given slowly during several minutes. Especially in a pediatric ICU, light and noise should be diminished and contact between the parents and the child should be encouraged, even when the child is undergoing mechanical ventilation.", 
    "63": "Encompassing the range from subtle cognitive impairments to frank delirium, toxicity due to benzodiazepines and to anticholinergic-containing compounds is reviewed. For benzodiazepines, an extensive literature suggests that they impair immediate and delayed memory, psychomotor performance, and subjective complaints of station. This, in several studies, results in increased patient morbidity (e.g., increasing risk of hip fractures). Anticholinergic compounds are widely utilized in managing elderly patients, particularly nursing home residents. Toxicity from anticholinergic compounds, detected by anticholinergic drug levels, is significantly correlated with the presence and severity of delirium in a number of settings including postoperative patients and elderly nursing home residents. Possible means of identifying the syndrome by prediction of dose and type of medication, as well as by quantitative EEG, are reviewed.", 
    "64": "Current customary medication with anxiolytic potential has different main-points of impact and individual potentials of risk, which influence strategies of therapy in a limiting way. Benzodiazepines--which are very effective in various anxiety-disorders--can therefore only be applied under well controllable conditions within a limited period of time, in order to reduce the risks of dependency. Also administration of low-doses neuroleptica--which within these doses also show a high potential of anxiety-impact beside a high tolerance--must be limited to a period of two or three months to prevent late development of dyskinesias. Main indications for the application of antidepressive drugs are panic-conditions, cases of phobia and depressive anxiety. In the following a therapy-pattern for management of panic-conditions with Clomipramin will be gone into more detailed. Complementary anxiolytic characteristics of Buspiron and beta-blockers with their specific indication-fields will be brought up.", 
    "65": "The influence of naltrexone on liver function in heroin addicts was studied, with respect to the metabolizing function by using the antipyrine clearance and to cellular damage by monitoring plasma levels of hepatic enzymes. The clearance of antipyrine was not affected by naltrexone treatment, and, during the study period, the use and withdrawal of benzodiazepines and alcohol did not change this parameter; moreover, there was no relationship between changes in plasma hepatic enzymes and antipyrine half-life. Mean plasma levels of hepatic enzymes did not show significant modification in the course of treatment with naltrexone.", 
    "66": "The acute psychomotor effects after oral doses of 30, 60 and 120 mg remoxipride, a new selective D2 receptor blocker, and placebo were investigated in a double-blind crossover study in 11 healthy male volunteers. Two out of the first three subjects given 120 mg remoxipride experienced marked akathisia, and therefore no subsequent subjects were given this dose. There were no other clearly drug-related adverse effects reported below 120 mg, although restlessness was reported at 60 mg. Remoxipride was associated with increases in error scores on a continuous attention task and on auditory vigilance, and with a reduction in critical flicker frequency, suggesting a decrease in arousal level. There were no significant changes in psychomotor measures such as choice reaction time, decision making time, or body sway. Subjective assessments using visual analogue scales showed a slight dose-related increase in drowsiness, while the calm-excited scale showed a small change in the excited direction with 30 mg only. The peak effects were at 4-6 h after drug intake, which was later than expected from previous pharmacokinetic data. These results indicate that remoxipride may have a slight depressant effect in the dose-range used. The pattern of changes is consistent with current theories on the role of dopamine in attention and arousal, and with the effects of other neuroleptics. It differs, however, from tranquilisers such as the benzodiazepines, which show a more global pattern of effects.", 
    "67": "The abuse of benzodiazepines by narcotic addicts has been well documented. However, the pharmacological basis of this abuse is not clear. In this study the effects of different benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam: 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg; nitrazepam: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; diazepam: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; chlordiazepoxide: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; and triazolam: 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) on the morphine withdrawal syndrome in mice have been compared. Drugs were administered 30 min before naloxone-induced withdrawal. All benzodiazepines tested induced similar changes in some of the signs of morphine abstinence: decreased jumping behavior and increased wet dog shake frequency. Jumping behavior was particularly decreased by triazolam and wet dog shakes were mainly increased by flunitrazepam and nitrazepam. Forepaw treading was reduced by flunitrazepam, diazepam and triazolam, increased by nitrazepam and not changed by chlordiazepoxide. Tremor was effectively reduced by diazepam but less reliably by the other benzodiazepines. Teeth chattering was reduced by flunitrazepam and diazepam. These results indicate that benzodiazepines can interfere with the expression of the morphine withdrawal syndrome.",

On the basis of this information one may more exactly use drugs which act on the synaptic and postsynaptic receptors as well as drugs which influence the synthesis of neurotransmitters.", 
    "69": "In 18 patients with a benzodiazepine (BZD) dependency the drug was withdrawn. The dose of BZD was gradually reduced in nine of the patients, while the others were additionally treated with carbamazepine (CBZ) for a further 15 days after BZD discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms were assessed every third day during the study period. When comparing results in both groups, a clear trend towards less severe withdrawal symptoms could be observed in the group treated with CBZ. Some of the differences were statistically significant on days 9-12 after BZD withdrawal. Fundamental withdrawal symptoms (like hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, abnormal perception of movement, depersonalisation or derealisation) were also less severe in the group treated with CBZ compared with the group not receiving that treatment. These findings support the results of previous reports indicating a therapeutical effect of CBZ in BZD withdrawal.", 
    "70": "We describe the use of combination therapy with carbamazepine and benzodiazepine (BZ) for treating 4 cases of polydrug analgesic/depressant withdrawal. Carbamazepine appears to be effective in BZ withdrawal through its agonistic action on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. In cases where opioid abuse is suspected, analgesic nitrous oxide appears the most suitable agent to be added to this regimen, in view of its opioid properties, rapidity of action, and synergistic actions with benzodiazepines in ameliorating withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol.", 
    "71": "The role of the cholinergic nervous system in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage has been examined in rats. Oral administration of 50 or 80% ethanol produced haemorrhagic lesions which were reduced by atropine pretreatment (0.65, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg injected i.p.); there was lesser protection against the higher dose of ethanol. Pirenzepine (a specific M1 receptor antagonist) pretreatment (0.1, 0.2, 1 or 2 mg/kg, injected s.c.) also protected against ethanol-induced gastric injury to a similar extent; it also increased the amount of adherent mucus on the glandular mucosa. This action may, therefore, account for the protective action of the ganglion blocker. It is concluded that ethanol may stimulate the stomach wall ganglionic nicotinic receptors to activate the postganglionic fibres and subsequently the muscarinic receptors which would then trigger off some of the ulcerogenic mechanisms in the stomach. However, ethanol could also produce gastric damage via the non-cholinergic mechanisms; this action becomes more prominent in gastric injury produced by high doses of ethanol.", 
    "72": "1. The role of endogenous CCK in the development of digestive enzyme activities in small intestine and pancreas was investigated in suckling rats. Synthetic protease inhibitor (camostat 100 micrograms/g bwt) was orally administered twice daily for 5 days from 11 days of age. 2. Pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and alteration of pancreatic enzyme composition, especially decreases in amylase activity and increases in trypsin and chymotrypsin activities were produced by camostat treatment. These changes were completely suppressed by simultaneous administration of the potent CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718 (1 microgram/g bwt). 3. With camostat treatment, intestinal lactase activity decreased to 41%, while maltase and sucrase activities increased 3 and 2.5 times respectively. These changes in enzyme activities were not affected by the application of L-364,718. 4. The mucosal disaccharidase and pancreatic enzyme activities could not be modified by chronic subcutaneous injection of camostat. The precocious induction of maltase and sucrase activities by camostat treatment was also observed in the adrenalectomized pups. 5. These results indicate that pancreatic growth accompanied by alteration of digestive enzyme composition in the suckling rats is regulated by endogenous CCK, but the precocious induction of disaccharidase activities is not mediated by endogenous CCK released by camostat treatment.", 
    "73": "In the present study, the effects of a new anxiolytic, DN-2327, were compared to those of diazepam and buspirone in rats in the elevated plus-maze test. Two indices of anxiety were obtained in this test: the number of entries into the open arms expressed as a percentage of the total number of arm entries and the percentage of time spent on the open arms. Both a typical anxiolytic, diazepam, at 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, PO and a new anxiolytic, DN-2327, at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, PO dose-dependently increased the two indices: the percentage of time spent on the open arms and the percentage of open-arm entries. On the other hand, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) at 10 and 20 mg/kg, IP decreased the two indices dose dependently as did yohimbine at 1.5 and 3 mg/kg, IP. DN-2327 at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, PO and diazepam at 5 and 10 mg/kg, PO dose dependently and significantly increased the two indices that were suppressed following administration of PTZ at 10 mg/kg, IP. The effects of both DN-2327, 5 mg/kg, PO, and diazepam, 10 mg/kg, PO, on the two indices were significantly antagonized by the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist flumazenil, 20 mg/kg, IP. Buspirone (2.5-20 mg/kg, PO) did not affect either of the two responses but dose dependently decreased the number of rearings, although in the Vogel conflict test, the anti-conflict activity of buspirone was equipotent to that of diazepam and DN-2327 at the minimum effective dose (10 mg/kg, PO) of each drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "The anxiolytic activity and tolerance of four doses of suriclone (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg tid), diazepam (5 mg tid), and placebo were compared in six parallel groups of 54-59 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder (DSM III-R). After a 1-week placebo run-in period, the patients were treated for 4 weeks, with assessments at baseline and after 1, 2, and 4 weeks by the Hamilton anxiety scale and the Clinical Global Impressions. Results showed better improvement with active drugs as compared to placebo, without significant differences among the four different doses of suriclone and diazepam. The number of adverse events, particularly drowsiness, was significantly higher with diazepam than with suriclone, particularly 0.1 and 0.2 mg tid which did not differ from placebo. These results demonstrate that suriclone at daily doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 mg tid is an effective anxiolytic, better tolerated than diazepam.",

    "76": "The therapeutic management of the cocaine addict deals with a wide range of physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms, including a sometimes overwhelming craving for cocaine. Many medications have been used in the treatment of cocaine withdrawal and dependence, using as a rationale, known pharmacologic effects of cocaine on neurotransmitters. Animal observations related to dopamine depletion, receptor supersensitivity, cocaine-induced kindling, and serotonin depletion have all generated pharmacotherapeutic interventions for cocaine abuse. An extensive review of the use of these agents is presented. Pharmacotherapeutic strategies in dealing with the methadone-maintained cocaine abuser are considered. Future areas of interest and limitations of pharmacotherapy in dealing with cocaine abuse are discussed.", 
    "77": "The popularity and widespread availability of benzodiazepines (BZD) has led to their frequent abuse in intentional drug poisoning. Although mortality from pure BZD overdose is usually small, in elderly, debilitated patients, or when BZD are combined with other CNS depressant drugs, morbidity increases significantly and outcome may be fatal. Drug overdose is therefore a medical emergency necessitating close observation and support of vital functions. Recently, the specific BZD antagonist flumazenil (Anexate) has become clinically available and much experience in its usefulness has accumulated. The present review summarizes a total of 30 studies and reports published to date, involving approximately 760 intoxicated patients. Flumazenil was evaluated both in prehospital use as well as in emergency rooms or in intensive care units. The age of patients ranged from 4-90 years and doses of flumazenil varied between 0.3-10 mg, approximately 1 mg being the most frequently used. All patients intoxicated with only BZD returned to full consciousness within minutes after the injection of flumazenil. When a mixture of BZD and other CNS depressants was abused, a range of effects was observed. This varied from no change to a return to full orientation, depending on the contribution of the BZD to the state of unconsciousness. Re-sedation occurred in about 65% of flumazenil treated patients, usually within 0.5-3 h after the first dose, the shorter interval being associated with mixed-drug poisoning. Repeated doses of the antagonist (0.2-2 mg), sometimes followed by continuous infusion (0.1-0.5 mg/h), were effective in maintaining patients fully oriented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "1. Rat pups emit ultrasonic calls during brief episodes of social separation. These calls have been variously described as \"distress\" calls and may be related to the separation cries expressed by the young of many mammalian species. 2. Ultrasonic call of rat pups are modulated by environmental stimuli such as ambient temperature, olfactory and tactile stimuli associated with the nest. 3. Calls are also sensitive to a variety of purported anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs, including the benzodiazepines, serotonin agonists, and ligands at the NMDA-glycine receptor complex. 4. In addition to providing a simple test for the anxiolytic properties of drugs, this model may also provide new insights about the development and neurobiology of anxiety.", 
    "79": "The use of blood platelets as a nerve terminal model for serotonin is well documented. However, it is clear that the use of platelets as a model can be justified only for those parameters where it may be shown that blood platelets and neural cells share almost identical features. The excellent similarity between the serotonin transport mechanisms in platelets and in nerve terminals, and the existence of various receptors for biogenic amines, peptides and substances with neuronal activity on platelet membrane offer a really unique opportunity to utilize blood platelets as a system for drug evaluation. In our work platelet benzodiazepine binding sites and their modulation by different benzodiazepines in normals and in demented patients are examined."
