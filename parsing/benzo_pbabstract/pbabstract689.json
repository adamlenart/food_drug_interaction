Gerbils trained with a mixture of diazepam (8.0 mg/kg) and bemegride (20.0 mg/kg) evidenced response control more slowly than the group trained solely with diazepam.", 
    "1": "This paper presents a study comparing the effects on the mother and baby of a continuous intravenous infusion of pethidine and diazepam and of intramuscular pethidine and promazine. It is concluded that the administration of intravenous pethidine and diazepam is safe in labour provided that diazepam has not been given during the previous week.", 
    "2": "A significant number of violent acts are committed by individuals in whom central nervous system instability can be demonstrated by special electroencephalographic (EEG) activation procedures utilizing alpha-chloralose as the activating agent. Furthermore, subcortical electrograms suggest that this instability is related to a circumscribed ictal phenomenon in the limbic system. The abruptness of the aggressive act, the fact that the behavior is so often out of character for the individual and inappropriate for the situation, as well as the confusion and partial amnesia which accompany these episodes lend clinical support for the ictal hypothesis. Some anticonvulsants not only block the activated abnormalities on the EEG but also lead to dramatic clinical improvement in those individuals showing repeated and frequent aggressive behavior. For instance, in one study 46.7 percent and 53.3 per cent of the patients demonstrated activated abnormalities on no drug and placebo, respectively. When these same patients were receiving chlorpormazine or trifluoperazine, the activation rates were 60.0 per cent and 73.3 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, when these same patients were placed on a regimen of chlordiazepoxide the activation rate was reduced to 20 per cent (p smaller than or equal to .01). Another study involved severely distrubed chronically hospitalized psychotic patients whose aggressive uncontrolled outbursts relegated then not only to a locked ward, but often to isolation rooms despite high doses of phenothiazines. A regimen of chlordiazepoxide and", 
    "3": "Thirty-four patients with severe delirium tremens were allocated randomly to treatment with paraldehyde (10 ml rectally very 30 minutes) or diazepam (10 mg then 5 mg intravenously every 5 minutes) until they were calm but awake. Diazepam-treated patients became calm in one half the time needed to calm patients with paraldehyde. Half of the patients had delirium tremens in association with pneumonia, pancreatitis, or alcoholic hepatitis; these patients required twice as much paraldehyde or diazepam for initial calming as patients with delirium tremens alone. Maintenance of a calm state was accomplished easily with either diazepam, intramuscularly, or paraldehyde, rectally. Adverse reactions occurred in nine patients, all of whom had been treated with paraldehyde; these patients had greater degrees of fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia and required three times longer for initial calming than patients without adverse reactions. Diazepam given under this regimen is a safe and effective sedative for management of combative patients with severe delirium tremens.", 
    "4": "In 17 in-patients suffering from spasticity due to multiple sclerosis, the effect and tolerability periods were 4 weeks each. As to efficacy, the variables: spasticity, clonus, flexor spasms, gait and bladder function were evaluated clinically. No significant difference was found between the two drugs. As far as side-effects are concerned, sedation was specifically inquired about. Apart from that, spontaneoulsy reported side-effects were recorded. Sedation was more often seen during treatment with diazepam, while the side-effects during baclofen treatment were more varied. The total number and severity of side-effects were equal in the two treatment groups. A preference for one of the two treatment periods was stated by the investigator before the code was broken. A significant difference (p less than 0.001) in favor of Lioresal was found. This is discussed in the light of the fact that no significant difference was found for the individual symptoms or side-effects.",

    "6": "The velocity constants for chlordiazepoxide hydrolysis were measured by independent techniques. A quantitative TLC kinetic procedure is compared with an extractive method. The data derived from both processes are in approximate agreement, further exemplifying the feasibility of TLC for rapid stability evaluation of liquid formulations as well as solution kinetic studies. In the extractive procedure, benzodiazepine-substrate was separated from the lactam product by methylene chloride extraction of acidic aqueous solution. The TLC procedure consisted of separation on silica gel plates followed by elution and subsequent analysis. The log kappa-pH relationship for the hydrolysis representing water addition coupled with expulsion of methylamine is presented. This function is characterized by water and hydroxide-ion attack on monoprotic species along with specific hydrogen-ion catalysis at higher hydronium-ion concentrations, and the rate law for the decomposition of chlordiazepoxide is given. Trhrough several half-times (pH 0.15-11.5, 79.5 degrees), this hydrolytic reaction generating lactam predominated; however, more benzophenone was formed as the pH decreased. Velocity constants were invariant over a 200-fold concentration range. The subsequent acid-facilitated cleavage of lactam to benzophenone was not further investigated. Both general acid catalysis and general base catalysis were evidenced, with borate, acetate, formate, and phosphate buffers accelerating the conversion of chlordiazepoxide to lactam. At pH values below neutrality, nonlinear dependency of the rate constant on buffer concentration was observed. This finding may be explained by a change in the rate-determining step as buffer concentration varied.", 
    "7": "The action of bromazepam on insulin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was examined in 5 healthy volunteers in a randomized study. To measure acid output, the intragastric titration technique and a pH-sensitive telemetering capsule were used. Three series of experiments were performed: (1) insulin (0.2 U/kg body weight), stimulation alone; (2) simultaneous injection of insulin and bromazepam (0.1 mg/kg body weight), subjects kept awake; (3) synchronous injection of insulin and bromazepam but with subjects allowed to fall asleep after drug administration. In all three series after insulin administration a significant initial inhibition of gastric secretion occurred. There were no significant differences between the three series regarding the intensity of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels lower than 25 mg/100 ml were reached in all experiments. Bromazepam in subjects kept awake caused drowsiness and a lower gastric acid response to hypoglycemia as compared to insulin alone, but the difference was not significant. In subjects allowed to sleep, this reduction was marked and gastric acid output was significantly lower than in both other series. These findings suggest that sleep and drowsiness, rather than bromazepam itself, cause inhibition of insulin-induced gastric secretion.", 
    "8": "Violence is a symptom of an underlying mental state such as a psychosis, a characterological problem, or brain dysfunction. Thus drugs used to treat aggression in man exert effects by their specific pharmacological actions (e.g., antipsychotic, anticonvulsant). Most literature to date has dealt with animals and human models of aggression and lacks conceptual clarity. Aggression differs from depression, a coherent clinical entity, in its etiological diversity and its paroxysmal or impulsive basis, and this may account for the relationship seen in literature linking violence to epilepsy; yet literature on anticonvulsants is equivocal with regard to beneficial effects on aggression. Lithium has been shown to have positive effects, although its mode of action is unclear. A variety of antipsychotic agents and minor tranquilizers have been mentioned. Central nervous system stimulants have been found useful to treat hyperkinetic syndromes in both children and adults where aggression is a symptom. Hormonal agents are discussed. Drug treatment of aggression should not obscure the need for verbal therapies, and social and environmental factors should always be regarded.", 
    "9": "Clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of drugs in human aggression have been scarce until recent years. The potential antiaggressive action of minor tranquilizers in humans has received little attention in spite of the claimed \"taming effect\" in some animal studies. A recent report examining the literature regarding the effects of benzodiazepines on animal models of aggressive behavior has pointed out the lack of consistency in such findings. Similar observations have been noted in humans where reduction in aggressive manifestations is contrasted with an increase in hostility in a few studies, as well as with the appearance of \"paradoxical\" rage reactions. Some variables that could account for such discrepancies have been advanced. They include, among others, dosage, acute vs. chronic drug administration, and possible qualitive differences among this group of agents. Individual variations as to presenting clinical picture, initial levels of anxiety and hostility, and personality types have also been mentioned. Implications of some of these findings for future clinical research are discussed. At present, a study designed to test the efficacy of two benzodiazepines, at dosages higher than those usually recommended, is being carried out in a population of anxious, aggressive-prone individuals with poor impulse control. Thus far, and in agreement with our previous clinical experience, we have not seen \"paradoxical\" rage and such high dosages have been well tolerated.", 
    "10": "1 The residual effects of two benzodiazepines, nitrazepam (10 mg) and flurazepam hydrochloride (30 mg), and pentobarbitone sodium (200 mg) were studied by adaptive tracking and by reaction time. Performance was measured at 10 h, 13 h, 16 h, 19 h and 34 h after ingestion of each drug. Impaired performance on adaptive tracking was observed at 10 h, 13 h, 16 h and 19 h after nitrazepam and pentobarbitone sodium and at 10 h, 13 h and 16 h after flurazepam hydrochloride. Enhanced performance was observed at 34 h after nitrazepam and pentobarbitone sodium. 2 Increased reaction time persisted to 16 h after nitrazepam, flurazepam hydrochloride and pentobarbitone sodium and reaction time was also increased at 34 h after nitrazepam and pentobarbitone sodium. 3 During the morning immediately after ingestion, the subjects as a group were able to differentiate correctly between placebo and drugs, but they were not able to assess accurately the persistence of the residual effects of nitrazepam and pentobarbitone sodium. 4 Flurazepam hydrochloride would appear to be a more promising benzodiazepine than nitrazepam for use as a hypnotic by persons involved in skilled activity. There was a rapid recovery of performance during the afternoon and, unlike pentobarbitone sodium and nitrazepam, subjects retained the ability to recognize impaired skill.", 
    "11": "A scoring system for the neonatal abstinence syndrome has been devised and implemented as both a clinical and investigative tool. The score monitors the passively addicted infant in a more comprehensive and objective fashion, and facilitates a more precise evaluation of the clinical status of the infant undergoing withdrawal. In addition, the scoring system has been applied in research designed to test the comparative usefulness of various pharmacologic agents currently recommended for the neonatal abstinence syndrome, and has been found useful in following the progression and diminution of withdrawal symptomatology before, during, and after therapy. Furthermore, the scoring system provides a basis ofr developing uniform criteria for the assessment and treatment of the neonate born to the addicted mother.", 
    "12": "A simplified classification of the porphyrias is given which is thought to be advantageous to the anesthesiologist in determining those patients who are predisposed to acute attacks. These acute attacks may be precipitated by the administration of barbiturates, but may also be spontaneous. The current theory for the precipitation of the acute attack is described, with the probable mechanism being a decrease in uroporphyrinogen synthetase levels and the resultant interference in heme production. Increased formation of cytochrome P-450 with barbiturates also produces increased levels of delta aminolevulinic acid, which may be a cause of the acute attack. The significance in anesthesia and suggested means of anesthetic management are discussed.", 
    "13": "Although good correlation can be obtained between total daily dose and serum concentration in treatment with anticonvulsant drugs, many patients still show departures from this relation. The various factors which can influence serum concentrations of the administered drugs were to be domonstrated in a number of children who were receiving anticonvulsants at average dose levels and who developed evidence of overdose, or who failed to respond to therapy. The most important feature is that combined adminstration of several drugs may increase or inhibit metabolisation of the various substances, so that inadequate or excessively high serum concentrations result. Furthermore, irregular intake of the necessary medication must always be taken into account in the case of treatment on an out patient basis. Routine determinations of serum levels of anticonvulsant drugs in these patients are called for because of this.", 
    "14": "Bilirubin encephalopathy in the newborn is caused not so much by the level of total serum bilirubin but rather by the level of free bilirubin not bound to albumin. Compared to adults prematures and newborns show a higher tendency towards separation of bilirubin from the albumin bond which is statistically significant as could be demonstrated by measurements in serum and plasma. This might be due to a lower bilirubin binding capacity of the neonatal albumin or a competitive displacement of the bilirubin from the albumin bonds by unknown endogenous substances. The influence of several drugs, of blood exchange transfusion and of light in phototherapy on the cleavage of bilirubin from its albumin bond was examined. Some drugs, but not the phototherapylight, enhanced displacement.", 
    "15": "The influence of chlorodiazepoxide (CDP), oxazepam (OX), temazepam (TE) and nitrazepam (NI) on serotonin (5-HT) turnover in the brain stem and hypothalamus of normal and aggressive rats was studied on the basis of the rate of disappearance of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) after inhibition of MAO. Agressiveness in rats was induced by electric stimulation. All the tested compounds diminished 5-HT turnover in both cerebral structures in normal and aggressive rats. The strongest inhibition was produced by CDP in the brain stem of normal and hypothalamus of aggressive rats. The remaining substances acted with equal strength. Only OX had no influence on 5-HT turnover in the brain stem of aggressive rats.", 
    "16": "To shed light on the practice of outpatient anaesthesia in Finland 126 hospitals performing outpatient surgery were asked about the drugs used and about postoperative care. 64% of the hospitals replied. Intravenous were more popular than inhalation agents. Diazepam (57%), propanidid (52%) and thiopentone (52%) were the most commonly used drugs. Nitrous oxide, mostly in combination with other anaesthetics, diazepam with pethidine, and halothane were used in 48%, 41% and 36% of the hospitals respectively. Divinylether and diethylether were employed in 35% and 15% respectively. Propanidid, thiopentone and diazepam were the first choice in 29%, 21%, and 11% respectively, while divinylether was still the first choice agent in 11%. Most central hospitals used nitrous oxide (82%), thiopentone (65%), halothane (60%), propanidid (50%) and methohexitone (25%). Small hospitals, where anaesthesia was not administered by specialists, most frequently used ethers (divinylether 51%, diethylether 29%), diazepam with pethidine (54%), propanidid (49%) and diazepam alone (34%). After propanidid, thiopentone and methohexitone patients were generally kept in hospital for 3 hours and advised against driving for between 17 to 20 hours. It is concluded that the choice of drugs seems appropriate. However, supplementation with nitrous oxide could reduce the high doses of intravenous anaesthetics used and result in reduced side-effects and more rapid recoveries. The wide use of involved anaesthetic techniques in rural areas stresses the importance of teaching anaesthesiology to general practitioners.", 
    "17": "The effective use of diazepam for narcosis in cases of injury requiring painful manipulations is dependent on adequate dosage, titrated for each patient.

    "18": "A potent benzodiazepin derivative, clonazepam, was studied over a range of single doses to determine tolerance for the drug. The best tolerated doses were 0.5 and 1 mg.

    "19": "Sulpiride was administered to 21 children with school phobia. All had shown some depressive symptoms in addition and had been treated by nonpharmacological measures. 13 of them returned to school within a few days and depressive symptoms disappeared eventually (the recovered group). In 3, behaviour at home returned to their premorbid status, but school refusal persisted (the improved group). In the remaining 5, no improvement was observed. In comparison to the present writer's previous experience with imipramine and benzodiazepines, the response to sulpiride in school-phobic children is more rapid and remarkable.", 
    "20": "In 15 patients with severe aortic stenosis who were to undergo aortic valve replacement, the induction sequence ketamine followed by pancuronium caused a 25% rise in systolic blood pressure. In a similar series, the induction sequence diazepam + morphine followed by pancuronium caused a 22% fall in systolic blood pressure. This shows that the blood pressure rise caused by ketamine is not blocked by pancuronium, although pancuronium may possibly modify the cardiovascular responses to this drug.", 
    "21": "Misuse and abuse of diazepam among addiction-prone individuals is reported. The most common pattern of abuse appears to be periodic ingestion of 30 to 80 mg of diazepam in one dose, either alone or in conjunction with methadone or other narcotics. Two cases of physical dependency to diazepam have been observed. Many addict patients using diazepam are buying it on \"the streets\". All physicians should know that diazepam abuse and misuse is occurring, and careful attention should be given to prescribing, transporting and storing this drug.", 
    "22": "State-Dependent Learning (SDL) occurs when a response learned in a particular drug stste does not transfer to another drug state. SDL was demonstrated and disrupted in a modified T-maxe escape learning task, using male hooded rats. SDL groups were trained each day in one drug state (either Librium, 40 mg/kg or sterile water) and then given non-shock test trials in both drug states. SDL Ss showed drug-dependent retention since they turned randomly in opposite-state test trials and significantly above random level (P greather than 0.02) when in the training drug state. For the Transfer Ss, 1k Hz tone was simultaneously paired with foot shock in training and continued to be sounded on every non-shock test trial. Transfer Ss turned in the training direction regardless of drug state. Drug-dependence in the SDL groups and transfer in the Transfer groups were also demonstrated in response latencies. The tones were emotional memory prompters initiating some process that mediated transfer between drug states. The theoretical importance of these results were discussed in relation to energizing and directing functions of emotions and symmetrical and asymmetrical transfer.", 
    "23": "Ratlings born of six drug-addicted and a control group of parent rats were raised under the influence of the same drugs administered in drinking water. They were trained in a conditioned avoidance paradigm (CAR) from the 7th week when the drugs were withdrawn except in two subgroups of flurazepam and morphine. The growth rate was not appreciably impaired except for temporary slowness in morphine and alcohol-raised rats; it was faster in phenobarbitone and meprobamate-raised rats. The CAR-acquisition rates of the treatment groups were quite close and parallel to that of the controls except for the morphine, meprobamate, medazepam and the two drug-trained subgroups; whereas, the rats raised on low-dose morphine showed a faster than control acquisition rate. No evidence of state-dependent learning was obtained from this study.", 
    "24": "This experiment compared the effects of (u) \"early undernutrition\" by rearing in large litters and (ii) an early handlin g stress, on avoidance learning in Swiss white mice. The two treatments, the first leading to permanent physical stunting and the second not, had similar and additive detrimental effects on avoidance performance. Treatment with the minor tranquillizer Chlordiazepoxide improved performance in all groups but had a proportionately greater effect on previously undernourished, handled mice. Thus the poor avoidance performace of mice reared in large litters appears to be largely independent of the growth stunting effect and more closely related to an elevated stress response produced by stress in early life.", 
    "25": "Neurophysiological studies employing drugs have been undertaken in the natural syndrome of photically induced epilepsy in the Senegalese baboon Papio papio. GABA-mediated inhibition, both pre- and posysynaptic, plays an important role in the epileptic manifestations seen in this syndrome synapses can significantly modify photically induced epileptic responses, partly as a result of changes in afferent activity. The level of activity in dopaminergic systems can also modify the epileptic signs. Among anticonvulsant drugs, barbiturates and benzodiazepines are very effective against this type of epilepsy, whereas many other drugs are weakly active or toxic. A modification of the natural model (using allylglycine as a priming agent) is convenient for correlating acute anticonvulsant activity and neurological toxicity with plasma concentrations of anticonvulsant agents.",

If the Apgar score after 5 or 10 min decreases in relation to the score of the 1st minute, a depression by drugs has to be considered if other causes are eliminated. Some drugs and typical symptoms are described as for instance diazepam, addiction causing drugs, reserpin and imidazol derivatives. With regard to the direct effect of drugs the danger of the simultaneous application of several remedia is especially pointed out.", 
    "28": "The practise of repeated doping of the sport horse led us to examine its effects on the health of the animal, and particularly on muscular activity. The main doping agent used at present (acepromazine) has already been studied (COURTOT et al., 1974). In this paper, we study the secondary effects of diazepam, a derivative of the benzodiazepine series, which is being used more and more frequently on horses. In treated animals as compared to controls, we observe: -- a slight respiratory depression related solely to effort, -- an increase in seric creatine phosphokinase rate with no apparent relation to effort. A discussion of these results leads to the conclusion that the secondary effects of diazepam are: -- a punctual effect on respiration as related to decreasing effort intensity, -- a toxic effect on muscle.", 
    "29": "Thirty-five infants born over a two-year period to mothers participating in a methadone-maintenance treatment program were studied The average birthweight was normal (3240 gms) for infants born to mothers who conceived while taking methadone, and 465 gms less (2775 gms) for infants conceived while their mothers were taking heroin (p less than .01). Sixty percent of the infants demonstrated mild or no symptoms and 40% developed moderate or severe symptoms. The infants whose symptoms were most severe were born to mothers who had documented histories of polydrug abuse. Many infants were slow to gain weight in the neonatal period. Thereafter growth and development have remained generally within the normal range.", 
    "30": "The effects of a new psychopharmacologically-active agent taclamine (AY-22,214 (AY)(a dibenzocycloheptaisoquinolines)) on noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin(5-HT) turnover in the brains of normal and/or stressed animals were determined by the use of both non-isotopic and isotopic techniques; a comparison with chlordiazepoxide (CL) was carried out. Both AY and CL antagonized the increase in NA and 3H-NA turnover due to immobilization stress in whole, and selected regions, of the rat brain. AY, unlike CL did not decrease 3H-NA turnover in brains of non-stressed animals. AY accelerated the turnover of DA in whole brain and 3H-DA in the striatum. In contrast, CL decreased turnover of each. AY did not alter 5-HT turnover. CL decreased 14C-5-HT turnover in regions of rat brain; in addition, it antagonized the pargyline-induced rise in 5-HT and potentiated the subsequent fall in levels of 5-HIAA. Neither AY nor CL affected the 5-HT uptake in the mouse brain. It is concluded that AY appears to exhibit both similarities and differences to CL with regard to its effects on biogenic amine turnover.", 
    "31": "A procedure was used where responses by a pigeon produced electric shock both to that pigeon (response-dependent shock) and to another pigeon (response-independent shock) working under the same schedule of food presentation. Both response-dependent and response-independent shock partially suppressed responding. Pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide and ethanol increased responding suppressed by response-dependent shock, but only pentobarbital increased responding suppressed by response-independent shock. Morphine, d-amphetamine, chlorpromazine, doxepin, and pentazocine either had no effect, or further decreased rates of responding suppressed by response-dependent or response-independent shock.", 
    "32": "In 10 patients with definite forms of neurosis, controlphysiologic and biorhythmometric investigations were carried out to establish the effectiveness of diazepam therapy. After acute application of 10 mg diazepam, an increase in the degree of minute-rhythmic coupling correlated positively with a decrease of the control area, of the time adjustment of the heart rate after load-related deflection, and with an increase in a derived complex parameter of control quality. Chronic therapy with diazepam reversed the positive tendency of the biorhythmometric and control parameters. The results permit the conclusion that the minute-rhythmic coupling degree lends itself to diagnostic evaluation of the actual synchronization state or the related neurovegetative reaction state.", 
    "33": "In 9 students the ECG, the respirogram, the EOG, the auditomotor and optomotor reaction times, and the reproduction of 10-digit numbers from the immediate memory (repeated at intervals of 15 sec) were investigated in 25 experiments of 20 min prior to and following p.o. application of 7.5-10 mg diazepam. The autocorrelation function and the power spectrum from about 200 time series were computed, and the frequencies found were verified in the range from 0.2-2.0 min-1. From all possible digit number relations of frequencies (restricted by definite criteria) between the investigated physiological oscillations, the portion of realized synchronizations was calculated as the degree of coupling. The minute-rhythmic coupling degree was found to increase significantly from 41 to 59 per cent under acute influence of diazepam. The heart rate, the respiratory rate and the reaction times did not change significantly. The immediate reproduction power proved significantly diminished. The results are discussed in regard to the facilitated rhythmic synchronization connected with an anxiolytic tranquilizing and sedative-hypmotic action of diazepam.",

    "36": "Biotransformation of chlordiazepoxide was studied in mice following a single 1000-rad dose of hepatic irradiation. Meabolic N-demethylation of chlordiazepoxide in irradiated mice was impaired when tested 3 days after irradiation. No such effect was observed in mice tested 3 weeks or 6 weeks after irradiation. Thus, hepatic irradiation appeared to produce short-lived, reversible impairment of drug-metabolizing function. The effect was small and of uncertain biological significance.", 
    "37": "The effect of intravenous diazepam on unstimulated and on pentagastrin-stimulated gastric secretion has been studied in normal subjects.

Electrophysiological investigations support the idea that this neuralgia is due to a loss of central inhibition. During the first 1-2 weeks of treatment marked drowsiness is observed in the majority of cases. In one case, presence of a synergism between Clonazepam and L-dopa+ inhibitor was also observed."
