    "0": "Chloride salts of Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ had no effect on [3H]diazepam binding. Chloride salts of Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ increased [3H]diazepam binding by 34 to 68% in a concentration-dependent fashion. Since these divalent cations potentiated the GABA-enhanced [3H]diazepam binding and the effect of each divalent cation was nearly additive with GABA, these cations probably act at a site different from the GABA recognition site in the benzodiazepine-receptor complex. Scatchard plots of [3H]diazepam binding without an effective divalent cation showed a single class of binding, with a Kd value of 5.3 nM. In the presence of 1 mM Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+, two distinct binding sites were evident with apparent Kd values of 1.0 nM and 5.7 nM. The higher-affinity binding was not detected in the absence of an effective divalent cation and is probably a novel, super-high-affinity binding site.", 
    "1": "The effects of a number of relatively pure opiate antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone, diprenorphine), and putative mu- (morphine, etorphine) and kappa- (ketocyclazocine, ethylketocyclazocine) receptor agonists on sweetened condensed milk intake were examined over a broad range of doses in non-deprived rats and squirrel monkeys. The antagonists consistently decreased milk intake in both the rat and squirrel monkey. There were, however, species differences: diprenorphine was 30 times more potent than either naloxone or naltrexone in the squirrel monkey, but was of similar potency in the rat. The effects of the opiate agonists were more variable than those of the antagonists. In both species, all agonists decreased milk intake at high doses that also produced behavioral depression. Significant increases in drinking were produced only by low doses of ketocyclazocine and ethylketocyclazocine in the rat. The suppression of milk intake by the antagonists supports a modulatory role of opiate receptors in the control of drinking behavior, however, the effects of the agonists on drinking are less easily interpreted within this conceptual framework.", 
    "2": "Binding sites for muscimol and flunitrazepam were solubilized and their properties studied by ultrafiltration, isoelectro-focusing and cation-exchange chromatography methods. The heterogenity of binding sites for flunitrazepam was demonstrated in the ultrafiltration experiments: the binding sites with a molecular weight of more than 300,000 dalton were sensitive to stimulation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and those with a molecular weight of less than 300,000 dalton were not. The binding sites for flunitrazepam appeared to be low acidic molecules with pI 5.6-6.0 and binding sites for muscimol an apparently more heterogenous distribution in the range of pH 4.6 to 5.9 was detected. Cation-exchange chromatography revealed two subpopulations of binding sites for muscimol one of which copurified together with binding sites for flunitrazepam. Each subpopulation exhibited only one class of binding site with Kd = 20 nM for a subpopulation copurifying together with binding sites for flunitrazepam and Kd = 9 nM for the other.", 
    "3": "We studied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine, and muscarinic cholinergic receptor-binding by quantitative autoradiography. In coronal sections from the brain of a patient with Huntington disease, binding for all three receptors in caudate and putamen was lower than control values. Binding to GABA and benzodiazepine receptors was increased in lateral and medial pallidum and decreased in ventrolateral thalamus. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors were markedly decreased in pallidum but not thalamus. The findings suggest that loss of striatal afferents to both segments of pallidum results in GABA and benzodiazepine receptor supersensitivity, and support the utility of quantitative autoradiography for receptor studies in human postmortem material.", 
    "4": "Barbiturates enhance the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptors solubilized with the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate (CHAPS) from bovine cortex. The enhancement by the barbiturates is seen as a decrease in the dissociation constant, KD, for specific benzodiazepine binding, with no effect on the number of binding sites. The effect of the barbiturates is facilitated by chloride ions, is concentration-dependent, and has a specificity that correlates well with the anesthetic potency of barbiturates. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding activity is stable with storage at 4 degrees C, but barbiturate enhancement of soluble benzodiazepine binding activity decayed rapidly (t 1/2 = 48 h). [3H]Muscimol binding (GABA receptor) activity was also enhanced by barbiturates. Agarose gel filtration column chromatography of the CHAPS-solubilized receptor proteins showed the same elution profile as receptors solubilized with sodium deoxycholate, and enhancement by barbiturates was observed for both the benzodiazepine and GABA binding activities.", 
    "5": "The molecular size of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor in the synaptic membrane of brain cortex (bovine or rat) was determined by an improved version of the radiation inactivation method to be 220,000. An identical size was found simultaneously for the associated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor and for the component binding beta-carboline esters. It is proposed that all three activities reside in a single protein or protein complex in the membrane. The size in solution, after extraction into Triton X-100 medium from exhaustively washed membranes, was estimated by sedimentation constant (9.4S) and by gel filtration ( approximately 230,000 apparent MW), again with the BZ and GABA binding activities behaving identically. This size applies to the component that undergoes photoaffinity labelling by [3H]flunitrazepam in the membrane, and contains a 51,000 Mr polypeptide as the BZ-binding subunit. It is concluded that a protein complex or oligomer of 200,000-220,000 MW carries a class of BZ-binding sites and an associated class of GABAA sites.", 
    "6": "Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function was examined in 28 hospitalized, withdrawing alcoholic patients. Fourteen patients met DSM-III criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Elevated 8 a.m. basal cortisols were noted in 7 depressed alcoholic patients (50%) and no non-depressed alcoholics (P less than 0.01). Escape from dexamethasone suppression was noted in 9 depressed alcoholics (64%) and no non-depressed alcoholics (P less than 0.005). The measurement of HPA axis function may be a useful marker for endogenous depression in an alcoholic population.", 
    "7": "We evaluated the EEG reaction to an intravenous injection of diazepam as an additional tool in difficult localization problems in epilepsy. The normal reaction to diazepam being an increase in beta activity, it was assumed that a poor increase indicated an abnormal region. This method was tested in 21 epileptic patients having chronically implanted intracerebral electrodes. Beta activity before and after injection was quantified by spectral analysis; increases were compared in homologous contralateral channels. In 12 of the 21 cases the area of poorest response to diazepam was identical to that of seizure onset. In 7 cases, there was some overlap between the area of poorest diazepam response and that of seizure onset, but they did not exactly coincide. In two cases there was no overlap between the two areas. Agreement was slightly higher when comparing diazepam response and area of highest interictal spike activity. This procedure is simple and without risk, particularly compared to the thiopental injection which is used for the same purpose. It is helpful in determining abnormal areas when localization information from various diagnostic sources are conflicting. Even when the epileptic focus is well defined, it can point to other poorly functioning areas.", 
    "8": "During acute intoxications, the first EEG may show persistence or abolition of cerebral activity, but the possibility of recovery after isoelectric tracing in toxic comas must be emphasized. EEG patterns frequently suggest the probability of hypnotic tranquilizer poisoning; 4 types of EEG are encountered corresponding to different grades of toxic coma. Recurrent periods of electrical silence alternating with bursts of activity are habitually recorded in carus comas with hypothermia due to acute barbiturate intoxication, with good prognosis. The possibility of a neurological disturbance associated with drug overdose must be raised whenever an asymmetric tracing is encountered. Serial recordings may detect complications such as: a localized lesion, anoxia or, very rarely, typical paroxysmal abnormalities reappearing in comitial patients before emergence from a toxic coma. Paradoxical monomorphic delta activity corresponding to improvement must not be considered as an aggravation. Peculiar EEG findings occur after oral trichlorethylene poisoning, with temporary clinical deterioration and intermittent periods of electrical silence; recovery is possible. An alpha-like pattern after cardiac arrest of toxic origin has a poor prognosis. The appearance of alternating patterns suggests the development of irreversible brain damage.", 
    "9": "Having noticed in a wide series of subjects submitted to prolonged anaesthesia that the EEG activities induced by anaesthetic products exhibited transverse topographic distributions (preferentially medial or preferentially lateral) which varied in relation to the product utilised, the authors have verified, in a more limited series of 25 subjects, that benzodiazepines, the targets of which are situated within the axial structures of the CNS, are responsible for EEG modifications which show a maximal amplitude on the parasagittal medial area of the scalp, while propanidide, which mainly affects the cortex of the convexity (i.e. the superior level of the lateral structures of the CNS), induces activities which show a maximal amplitude on the lateral areas of the scalp. The EEG modifications induced by thiopental and fentanyl are also lateralized but more diffuse. These data must be verified by a more precise study of a larger series, taking into account the dose and the speed of injection of the anaesthetic agent.", 
    "10": "Based on the spectral analysis of drug-induced beta activity in 15 normal subjects, the authors distinguish 2 groups of beta spectra: (1) Peaked beta spectra with stable frequency (25 +/- 0.3 Hz) and an essentially precentral localization. Such spectra must depend on the activation of a dense and circumscribed population of neurons having strong synchronizing power. (2) Beta spectra widely dispersed with regard to frequency and topography, having generators that are more widely distributed or with a lesser power of synchronization. The spectra show significant interhemispheric energy asymmetries which are accentuated by eye opening. Finally, these two types of beta activity, although exhibiting a preferentially precentral localization, are not altered by movements. In contrast they react, while maintaining energy to eye opening by energetic changes, which allows one to distinguish these activities from sensorimotor rhythms.", 
    "11": "The potent benzodiazepine receptor ligands beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) and the corresponding methylester (beta-CCM) administered i.v. depressed segmental dorsal root potentials in spinal cats, reversed the prolongation of dorsal root potentials by phenobarbitone, and abolished the depression of a motor performance task induced by phenobarbitone in mice; beta-CCE enhanced the low-frequency facilitation of pyramidal population spikes in the hippocampus of anaesthetized rats. These effects of beta-carbolines reflect a depression of GABAergic synaptic transmission and, thus, are diametrically opposed to the enhancing action of benzodiazepine tranquilizers. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, while not affecting dorsal root potentials, hippocampal population spikes or phenobarbitone-induced motor performance depression, abolished the effects of beta-CCE on the three parameters and similar effects of beta-CCM on the spinal cord and motor performance. A three-state model of the benzodiazepine receptor is proposed in which benzodiazepine tranquilizers act as agonists enhancing the function of the benzodiazepine receptor as a coupling unit between GABA receptor and chloride channel, beta-carbolines act as \"inverse agonists\" reducing this coupling function, and Ro 15-1788 represents a competitive antagonist blocking both the enhancing effect of agonists and the depressant effect of \"inverse agonists\" on GABAergic synaptic transmission.", 
    "12": "A highly sensitive and selective glass capillary gas chromatographic negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assay was developed to measure peptidoaminobenzophenone(2-o-chlorobenzoyl-4-chloro-N-methyl-N'-glycylglycinanilide) and its metabolites; chlorodiazepam, chlorodesmethyldiazepam and lorazepam in human plasma. As peptidoaminobenzophenone underwent pyrolysis during gas chromatography, it was converted to a thermally stable aminoquinolone. Internal standards for these compounds were the respective deuterium labelled compounds. Calibration curves were prepared for the range of 1-100 ng ml-1. Interference by endogenous substances was negligible in the isobutane negative ion chemical ionization mode in contrast to the electron impact or positive ion chemical ionization mode. This method was used to determine the plasma levels in humans following oral administration of two 5 mg doses.", 
    "13": "The benzodiazepines and the beta-adrenergic blockers are effective in the treatment of anxiety neurosis (generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder) but offer little help in the treatment of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The antidepressants are often effective in agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorders, and the evidence suggests that their antipanic and antiobsessional effects may be independent of their antidepressant properties. There is suggestive evidence linking the antiobsessional effect to a specific neurotransmitter (serotonin) system.", 
    "14": "Despite extensive and numerous pharmacokinetic studies on benzodiazepines, the published pharmacokinetic data do not adequately explain the clinical differences found between different benzodiazepine derivatives after intravenous administration. Especially, correlations between initial drug responses and distributional changes of the benzodiazepines are limited. However, during the elimination phase some relationships exist between the kinetic and dynamic phenomena. Age, sex, diseases and concomitantly given drugs cause clinically important alterations in the pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines. Generally these anxiolytics and sedatives should be considered as adjuvants to general anaesthesia, but not primarily as routine induction agents. The major reasons for this limitation are a high variability in drug response, a relatively slow onset of action and long-lasting residual effects. However, benzodiazepines have many important advantages (see Table 5) when used as intravenous inducing agents of general anaesthesia.", 
    "15": "Eleven elderly confused patients were given a single dose of chlormethiazole, temazepam and placebo on separate nights with-in a 10-day period. There was no statistically significant difference between the three treatments the next morning in any of the tests, which included subjective and objective measures of mental ability, orientation and hangover effect. These results mirror those previously found in normal, healthy, elderly patients, and do not therefore support the contention that hypnotics increase confusion in demented patients, or that such patients are more sensitive to their actions. Indeed, plasma drug concentrations were on average twice as high in demented as in normal elderly subjects, thus raising the possibility of decreased sensitivity in the demented group. There was little correlation between plasma concentration and pharmacological effect.", 
    "16": "A study of benzodiazepine prescribing in a single-handed general practice was carried out over a period of three months. It seemed that the existing pattern of prescribing was indiscriminate and ineffective, and that repeat prescriptions were poorly controlled. A programme of controlled withdrawal was instituted for patients whose consumption of benzodiazepines was felt to be no longer appropriate. Of 103 patients identified who had been taking benzodiazepines for longer than three months, 78 were entered into the programme. On completion, 45 patients (58 per cent) had discontinued benzodiazepines completely, and a further 13 (17 per cent) were taking less than half their original dose. Four patients had failed to reduce consumption at all and two were lost to follow-up. At follow-up between three and five months later, 49 patients (63 per cent) had discontinued benzodiazepines completely and only two had restarted treatment. The median time taken to complete the programme was 3.2 weeks, with 95 per cent of patients completing within six weeks. Withdrawal was generally well tolerated, with a temporary increase in insomnia as the main symptom. Two patients experienced severe symptoms, but both had stopped treatment abruptly.", 
    "17": "The equilibrium kinetics of triazolam in aqueous solution was investigated in the pH range of 1-11 at body temperature. The quantitative study indicated that it forms equilibrium mixtures consisting of ring-opened and closed forms with the composition being dependent on pH. The equilibrium constants of the two species in the pH range studied were determined by GLC method. The apparent first-order rate constants were estimated from the decreasing or increasing absorbance of the mixture in solutions. The forward-reaction rate constant (kf) showed a bell-shaped kf-pH profile with a rate maximum at pH 4.59, which indicates not only that the carbinolamine intermediate forms during the equilibrium reaction, but that the rate-determining step of the reaction differs for the acidic and basic sides of the rate maximum. The reverse-reaction rate constant decreased with increasing pH and could not be estimated in the pH region greater than 5.65. Theoretical curves for both forward and reverse reactions satisfactorily fit the observed data. The pKa values of triazolam and its opened-form amine were estimated to be 1.52 and 6.50, respectively.", 
    "18": "As much information as possible should be obtained in clinical trials to assess possible interactions between test drugs and concomitant medications prescribed for other medical indications. Side effect profiles were compared in patients taking buspirone, mean = 20 mg/day; diazepam, 20 mg/day; clorazepate, 23 mg/day; and placebo, with or without concomitant medications. Approximately 1,000 anxious patients were included in the analysis; 700 received buspirone. The use of a variety of common medications did not affect the side effect profile in the buspirone, clorazepate, and placebo groups, but did increase the incidence of side effects in the diazepam group. The increased incidence of sedation noted with diazepam and clorazepate, however, was not due to concomitant medication.", 
    "19": "The efficacy and safety of buspirone (Buspar), diazepam (Valium), and placebo were compared in a 3-week double-blind study of 131 patients with scores of at least 15 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. Active drugs were administered orally in 5-mg tablets to a maximum dose of 10 mg t.i.d. Buspirone was given to 43 patients, diazepam to 46 and placebo to 42. There was significant improvement in all three treatment groups at 1 and 2 weeks, with further significant improvement with both active drugs, but not with placebo, at 3 weeks. The incidence of side effects reported voluntarily by patients was similar with the two active drugs, but drowsiness was significantly more frequent with diazepam.", 
    "20": "The anxiolytic properties of buspirone were assessed in a 4-week double-blind study in 240 anxious patients, 81 of whom received buspirone, 81 diazepam, and 78 placebo. Patients were required to have scores greater than or equal to 9 on the Covi and greater than or equal to 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, and to endorse at least 5 items on a 17-item Anxiety Entry Checklist. Among 212 evaluable patients, those who improved most were married, well-educated females who had both a positive family adjustment and a low level of depression. Diazepam produced relatively equal improvement in females and males. Diazepam seems more effective in reducing somatic symptoms, while buspirone appears more effective in reducing symptoms associated with cognitive and interpersonal problems. Main differences between the drugs were seen in side effect profiles.", 
    "21": "Preclinical studies have shown buspirone to have some characteristics of both a dopamine (DA) agonist and antagonist. Neuroendocrine and neurochemical studies were conducted to determine which actions occur in rats and man. Buspirone produced a dose-dependent increase in rat plasma prolactin (PRL) levels and enhanced the increase in plasma PRL levels produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and gamma-butyrolactone. Buspirone also blocked the inhibitory effect of dopamine on PRL secretion in vitro, which is consistent with the action of a DA antagonist. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study using eight normal male volunteers, buspirone (30, 60, and 90 mg) produced a dose-related increase in PRL levels 60-180 minutes later, and a significant increase in growth hormone in six of the eight volunteers, which could be evidence for a DA agonist effect in the human hypothalamus. The anxiolytic effects of buspirone could be due to either DA agonist or antagonist effects.", 
    "22": "The abuse potential of buspirone, a new dopaminergic antianxiety drug, was evaluated by assessing its subjective effects in standard (10 mg) and high (40 mg) doses. These were compared with methaqualone (300 mg), diazepam (20 mg and 10 mg), and placebo in 24 casual recreational sedative users. Addiction Research Center Inventory scales measuring euphoria, sedation, dysphoria, and abuse liability were used as dependent measures. Groups of subjects received all treatments in randomized order in six weekly 4-hour sessions. Compared to placebo, methaqualone caused elevated scores on euphoria, physical sedation, and abuse liability scales compared to placebo, while 40 mg buspirone caused increased physical sedation, increased physical and mental dysphoria, and lower abuse liability scores. Overall, buspirone at 40 mg appeared unlikely to be reinforcing to recreational illicit drug users; the 10 mg dose was not discriminable from placebo or 10 mg diazepam. Diazepam at 20 mg showed some euphoriant effect compared to placebo.", 
    "23": "Chief among the drawbacks of the benzodiazepines is the risk of a withdrawal syndrome when the drugs are discontinued after prolonged periods of use, even at therapeutic dosages. Another disadvantage, common to sedative, tranquilizer, and hypnotic drugs, is psychological impairment or inappropriate behavioral effects. The psychological effects and impairments associated with benzodiazepines will be presented as a standard against which to assess new drugs. Results of objective tests confirmed that buspirone showed similar effects to diazepam in terms of self-rated mental sedation, but less physical sedation. Buspirone had little physiologic effect and produced less impairment in psychological performance.", 
    "24": "Acute psychomotor and psychological effects of oral buspirone (10 and 20 mg) with and without alcohol (1 g/kg) were studied in a double-blind crossover trial in 12 young males. Treatments were administered at 1-week intervals in balanced order. Buspirone failed to impair objective performance but caused drowsiness and fatigue. The reference drug lorazepam (2.5 mg) impaired skills objectively, with less subjective impairment. Lorazepam, but not buspirone, interacted with alcohol.", 
    "25": "The effects on driving skills of buspirone and diazepam, singly and in combination with alcohol, were examined. Three groups of 16 subjects each (8 men and 8 women) received either 20 mg of buspirone, 15 mg of diazepam, or placebo daily for 9 days. On day 9, they also received alcohol (men, 0.85 g/kg; women, 0.72 g/kg). On days 1, 8, and 9, subjects were tested on a driving simulator and given four sessions of divided attention tasks examining tracking and visual search performance. Extensive evidence of performance impairment associated with diazepam contrasted with improved performance under chronic buspirone treatment. Alcohol effects were additive.", 
    "26": "Recent neurochemical and behavioral observations with the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic buspirone raise several issues of importance to neuroscientists. These include: (1) the role of a GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex in the actions of buspirone and other anxiolytics; (2) the involvement of dopaminergic pathways in mediating anxiety and/or anxiolytic actions; and (3) the existence of a common pre- or postreceptor \"effector system\" for buspirone and other antianxiety agents. These issues are critically discussed in light of recent findings.", 
    "27": "Rhesus monkeys trained to press levers for intravenous cocaine injections were tested with saline and various doses of buspirone, chlordiazepoxide, and clorazepate. Buspirone was not self-administered at rates significantly above saline control levels. Chlordiazepoxide and clorazepate also failed to serve as reinforcers under these conditions. The lack of reinforcing properties, taken together with the results of other preclinical behavioral studies, suggests a low potential for recreational use of buspirone in man.", 
    "28": "Rats trained on an avoidance-escape task were administered buspirone in doses ranging from 0.5 to 7.5 mg/kg. Low doses disrupted avoidance responding without impairing escape responding. Rats trained on an experimentally induced conflict procedure were also administered buspirone or diazepam (1.0 to 5.0 mg/kg). Buspirone and diazepam appeared to be equipotent as anxiolytics. Cynomolgus monkeys, also trained on the experimentally induced conflict task, were given intramuscular buspirone or diazepam (0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg). Both drugs produced an attentuation of conflict, further supporting the anxiolytic equipotency of buspirone and diazepam. The long duration of action of buspirone suggests the presence of at least one active metabolite.", 
    "29": "Buspirone is a novel psychotropic drug with clear anxiolytic activity in man. There are a number of neurochemical differences between buspirone and both neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Moreover, buspirone is extensively metabolized, and several metabolites are present in the brain together with the parent compound. One of these, 1-PP, is present in the brain at higher concentrations than the parent drug, particularly when the drug is given orally. On the basis of the reported experimental data, it can be postulated that buspirone's anticonflict activity in rats may be mediated, at least partially, through 1-PP, without involving any effect on the dopaminergic system. The possibility that buspirone and 1-PP may mimic the action of benzodiazepine on some sites in the complex benzodiazepine-GABA receptors is discussed.", 
    "30": "Biochemically, buspirone is unlike the benzodiazepines in that it neither stimulates nor inhibits 3H-benzodiazepine binding, does not affect the influence of GABA or halide anion on 3H-benzodiazepine binding, and does not interfere with GABA binding or uptake. Buspirone lacks anticonvulsant activity, interacts minimally with CNS depressants, and does not cause muscle relaxation. Its tranquilizing activity is characterized by the ability to (1) tame aggressive rhesus monkeys, (2) block conditioned avoidance responding in the rat, (3) inhibit shock-induced fighting in the mouse, and (4) attenuate shock-induced suppression of drinking in the rat. In vitro binding experiments indicate that buspirone lacks significant activity at several binding sites. It appears to interact only with the dopaminergic system and possesses properties that are similar to both dopamine agonists and dopamine antagonists.", 
    "31": "This discussion deals with several issues of potential importance in making refined comparisons between buspirone and reference drugs as to their relative sedative and antianxiety effects (cost/benefit analyses). Factors considered that may influence the balance of sedative and antianxiety effects include drug dose, initial level of anxiety, environmental contingencies, and criteria for sedation. Additional studies of buspirone are suggested, with special reference to depression and aggression, to explore further some of the properties observed in the clinical trials presented at this symposium on \"Buspirone: A Clinical Review of a New, Non-Benzodiazepine Anxiolytic.\"", 
    "32": "The safety and antianxiety and antidepressive effects of buspirone (average 16.5 mg/day) were compared in a double-blind trial with those of diazepam (15 mg/day). The two drugs were nearly equivalent in relieving symptoms of both anxiety and depression in 100 patients. Scores on the impaired cognition factor of the SCL-56 and confusion factor of the POMS showed significantly greater improvement with buspirone than with diazepam. Side effects, such as sedation and drowsiness, were significantly more frequent and severe with diazepam. Buspirone may be particularly indicated for anxious patients with associated depression.", 
    "33": "Animal studies and the original study comparing buspirone with diazepam and placebo indicated that sedative-hypnotic side effects and impairment in psychomotor function would be less with buspirone than with diazepam. This was borne out by the present double-blind study in which almost 700 patients received buspirone. Mean daily doses were buspirone, 20 mg; diazepam, 20 mg; and clorazepate, 24 mg. Sedation, lethargy, and depression were significantly less with buspirone than with diazepam or clorazepate and were comparable to placebo. There was no indication that other types of side effects would differ significantly from those seen with the benzodiazepines. Nervousness, headache, and dizziness were experienced more frequently with buspirone than with placebo.", 
    "34": "A retrospective study of the history of drug use in cancer patients, conducted in general practice and involving 972 patients, has suggested that concurrent treatment with barbiturates and benzodiazepines may involve a cancer risk. Concurrent usage of other drugs with barbiturates was investigated because barbiturates have been reported to alter the handling of other drugs by liver microsomes and to interact with chemical carcinogens in experimental animal systems. If the risk has a basis in fact, it may lie behind the recent report of a small cancer risk associated with barbiturate treatment, in a prospective study based on computerized prescription information in a defined population, raising the hope that our finding can be tested in a larger study. A possible risk associated with prolonged treatment with cortisone related drugs could not be excluded. Four per cent of the cancer patients had tumours at sites consistent with reported occupational hazards and a further 4% suspected site-hazard associations. Occupation and smoking did not contribute to the drug associations noted. Entry of cancer patients from general practice gave a true sample of cancer patients in the area, judged by the distributions of age, sex, marital status and cancer site. Choice of controls from consultations for a new complaint resulted in a group showing deviation in the types of patient similar to those reported for consultations in general practice.", 
    "35": "Flunitrazepam was given as an induction agent i.v. to 12 patients undergoing otologic operations. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated from serum samples at 5 min-72 h by 63Ni-EC-GLC. Pharmacodynamic characteristics were estimated subjectively by simple questionnaire and objectively by the anesthetist during and after anesthesia. The dose of flunitrazepam required for anesthesia varied from 14 to 33 (mean 21) micrograms/kg and was not related to age. The mean distribution volumes of flunitrazepam, calculated by the three-compartment open model, were Vd1 0.61 (SD = 0.36) l/kg, Vd2 1.4 (SD = 0.70) l/kg, and Vd3 3.6 (SD = 1.39) l/kg. The mean elimination half-life was 25 h and serum clearance was 94 ml/min. The maximum decreases in blood pressure during anesthesia correlated with the age of the patients. The general assessment of the anesthetist about this form of anesthesia was positive in 75% of the 12 cases. A clear anterograde amnesia was found.", 
    "36": "The manifestation of depersonalisation, its relationship with anxiety and depression, as well as its influence on the course of endogenous psychoses were investigated. Forty patients with severe depersonalisation were treated with the benzodiazepine, phenazepam, and 14 with clozapine. The data indicate that depersonalisation results from anxiety; it follows an anxiety attack and is successfully treated with anxiolytic drugs. In the case of endogenous depression, depersonalisation leads to lingering depressive phase, increasing the patients' resistance to antidepressive therapy. The protective and the harmful role of depersonalisation is discussed.", 
    "37": "We review the results of more than 120 studies of the treatment of tardive dyskinesia with noncatecholaminergic agents. The disorder is thought to arise from dopamine receptor supersensitivity brought on by long term neuroleptic-induced receptor blockade. Ironically, neuroleptics are the most consistently effective treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Nevertheless, it would be desirable to treat it with other compounds. The most intensively studied drugs are the cholinergics, including physostigmine, deanol, choline, and lecithin, but their efficacy has been equivocal. Anticholinergics, opiates, and tryptophan appear to worsen the syndrome or have no effect. Trials of gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists, lithium, and amantadine also produced mixed results. Effectiveness has been claimed for benzodiazepines, estrogens, and pyridoxine,, but the evidence is scant. A small number of preliminary reports on other treatments are also summarized. We discuss briefly the implications of these studies, but methodological problems limit interpretation.", 
    "38": "[3H]Diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNP) binding to washed and frozen synaptosomal membranes from rat cerebral cortex were compared. In Tris-citrate buffer, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and NaCl both increased [3H]diazepam binding more than [3H]FNP binding. GABA and pentobarbital both enhanced this effect of NaCl. Because of the extremely rapid dissociation of [3H]diazepam in the absence of NaCl and GABA, the Bmax (maximal binding capacity) was smaller by the filtration assay than by the centrifugation assay. [3H]FNP, which dissociates more slowly, had the same Bmax in both assays. [3H]Diazepam association had two components, and was faster than [3H]FNP association. [3H]Diazepam dissociation, which also had two components, was faster than that of [3H]FNP, and also had a greater fraction of rapidly dissociating species. [3H]FNP dissociation was similar when initiated by diazepam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, or Ro15-1788, which is a benzodiazepine antagonist. [3H]Diazepam dissociation with Ro15-1788, flunitrazepam, or clonazepam was slower than with diazepam. GABA and NaCl, but not pentobarbital, increased the percentage of slowly dissociating species. This effect of NaCl was potentiated by GABA and pentobarbital. The results support the cyclic model of benzodiazepine receptors existing in two interconvertible conformations, and suggest that, distinct from their binding affinity, some ligands (like flunitrazepam) are better than others (like diazepam) in inducing the conversion of the receptor to the higher-affinity state.", 
    "39": "Electroconvulsive seizures administered during the period of fetal benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site proliferation (days 16, 18 and 20 in gestation) significantly decreased the density of cerebral cortical benzodiazepine binding sites in exposed pups up to 21 days postnatal age. Significant decreases in seizure threshold were also found in exposed offspring. However, decreases in BZ sites were not accompanied by significant alterations in RO5-4864-displaceable benzodiazepine binding as seen after in utero exposure to phenytoin (DPH). Neither prenatal treatment affected the ability of GABA to enhance BZ binding in vitro. Prenatal exposure to electroshock delayed the onset of acoustic startle and eye-opening during postnatal development; similar effects were not seen following in utero exposure to DPH. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to seizures and DPH decrease postnatal BZ site proliferation by different mechanisms.", 
    "40": "The effects of picrotoxin (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg), an antagonist of GABA mediated chloride ion conductance changes, were examined on the acquisition and performance of a bidirectional active avoidance (BAA) response and on locomotor activity. Treatment with this agent disrupted both the acquisition and performance of this task and decreased locomotor activity. This picrotoxin-induced suppression of BAA was reversed by pretreatment with diazepam (2 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (d-AMP, 2.0 mg/kg) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD, 10 micrograms/kg) and was reversed partially by cinanserin (5 mg/kg) and methysergide (5 mg/kg). Picrotoxin-induced activity decreases in locomotor activity were antagonized by d-AMP, were partially reversed by LSD but were not reversed by methysergide. It is proposed that picrotoxin disrupts bidirectional active avoidance behavior by increasing the response suppressive effects of aversive stimuli and by inducing a general depression of motility.", 
    "41": "The benzodiazepine antagonist properties of Ro 15-1788 were evaluated in rats trained to discriminate between saline and either 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam or 10 mg/kg of pentobarbital in a two-choice discrete-trial shock avoidance procedure. When administered alone, 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam and 10 mg/kg of pentobarbital produced comparable amounts of drug-appropriate responding (less than 84%), whether rats were trained to discriminate between diazepam or pentobarbital and saline. Ro 15-1788 (3-32 mg/kg, p.o.), administered 10 min before diazepam or pentobarbital, produced a dose-related blockade of the discriminative effects of diazepam in both groups of rats, but was completely ineffective in blocking the discriminative effects of pentobarbital. The dose-effect curve for the discriminative effects of diazepam was shifted to the right in a parallel fashion 3- and 13-fold by 10 and 32 mg/kg of Ro 15-1788, respectively, indicating that Ro 15-1788 acts as a surmountable, competitive antagonist of diazepam. When administered alone, Ro 15-1788 (32-100 mg/kg, p.o.) produced primarily saline-appropriate responding, although 100 mg/kg of Ro 15-1788 produced drug-appropriate responding in one out of eight rats. When administered orally 30 min after diazepam, Ro 15-1788 (32 mg/kg) completely reversed within 10 min the discriminative effects of diazepam. The blockade of diazepam's discriminative effects by 32 mg/kg of Ro 15-1788 appeared to last at least as long (approximately 2 hr) as the effects of diazepam alone.", 
    "42": "The possible interaction of the benzodiazepine diazepam with synaptic mechanisms of the central neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has been studied in the rat using the superfusion in vitro release technique. The effect of diazepam (1-100 microM) on the spontaneous and potassium-induced release of radioactivity from superfused slices preloaded with [3H]5-HT prepared from cerebral cortex (fronto-parietal) and midbrain raphe region was monitored and compared. The results demonstrate a differential action of diazepam on the release of cortical and raphe 5-HT. In cerebral cortex diazepam significantly reduces both spontaneous and potassium-evoked release of [3H]5-HT. Conversely in raphe slices diazepam significantly enhances both spontaneous and potassium-evoked release of [3H]5-HT. In both tissues the effect of diazepam on K+-stimulated neurotransmitter release was abolished in the presence of picrotoxin. The experiments suggest that the effects of benzodiazepines on 5-HT mechanisms may be manifested at least in part through gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors.", 
    "43": "Injected i.v. into baboons, Ro 15-1788 (a benzodiazepine antagonist) and propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate did not modify either the behavior or the electroencephalogram at doses up to 2 mg/kg. Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate is a potent convulsant at doses of 20 micrograms/kg in photosensitive baboons and 100 micrograms/kg in non-photosensitive baboons. These convulsive doses of methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate are effectively antagonized by 0.5 mg/kg of Ro 15-1788 and also by 2 mg/kg of propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate.", 
    "44": "Three patients, consisting of a seven year old boy and two adult women, died after administration of presurgical anesthetic medication in an oral surgeon's office. Toxicological analysis for the drugs involved and medical records confirmed the three individuals had all received potentially lethal doses of pentazocine, a narcotic analgesic, along with unusually high and potentially lethal doses of diazepam. All had also received anesthetic doses of methohexital, au ultra-short acting barbiturate and general anesthetic. Doxapram, a respiratory stimulant, was given in all cases without beneficial effect, and caffeine was administered in one case. Narcotic antagonists were not administered in any of the cases. Use of such could very well have prevented death in these cases.", 
    "45": "The usage of hypnotic drugs in 23 local authority homes for the elderly was recorded in a one-day point-prevalence survey. Residents were under the care of their own general practitioners. From a total population of 1122 residents, 382 (34.0%) received hypnotics both on the night of the survey, and on the preceding night. The proportion of residents receiving hypnotics within each home varied from 2.3% to 56.5%. No preference was shown for prescribing short half-life hypnotics. The most frequently used hypnotic was nitrazepam, which accounted for 33.2% of total usage. These data were then compared with information similarly recorded from the same local authority homes six months earlier. The pattern and prevalence of drug usage showed little variation between the two surveys.", 
    "46": "A technique based upon an individual-subject design was used to investigate the effects of intravenous diazepam on the acquisition and performance of response chains in humans. In each of two conditions subjects were required to emit a different sequence of ten responses in a predetermined order on three levers. The conditions alternated within each session under a multiple schedule. In the performance condition the sequence of responses was the same each session. The second condition was a repeated-acquisition task. In this condition subjects were required to learn a different sequence of responses each session. Diazepam produced dose-dependent decreases in the overall rate of responding in each subject under both conditions. In two of the three subjects tested, errors were increased in the learning condition at doses lower than those required to disrupt accuracy in the performance condition. In one subject, accuracy in both the learning and performance conditions was equisensitive to the disruptive effects of diazepam. These data are consistent with the effects of the benzodiazepines in analogous animal procedures. Furthermore, the data suggest that the behavioral effects of intravenous diazepam may exhibit marked variations across subjects at clinically relevant doses (5-10 mg).", 
    "47": "Intravenous injection of ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE, 2 mg/kg) significantly reduced exploratory behaviour in a holeboard and 1 & 2 mg/kg markedly reduced the number of rears made. These effects were similar to those found with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). When they were given together the two drugs neither counteracted each other's effects, nor were their combined effects additive. We suggest that beta-CCE and the benzodiazepines might both act at one class of benzodiazepine receptor, as agonists to produce the same behavioural effects. The results are also discussed with reference to other intrinsic actions of these compounds.", 
    "48": "A swimming test was developed to provide a method for assessing gross motor behaviour in the guinea-pig (Cavia porcellus). The simplicity of the procedure enables a large number of animals to be tested in a short time. Learning was not required of the animals, thereby simplifying the interpretation of the effects of drugs. Control animals were highly motivated to complete the task and the variability in swimming times was small. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor sarin significantly increased swimming time in a dose-related manner and did not affect \"turning behaviour\" during the swim. Alcohol, diazepam and amphetamine increased swimming time but only in the larger doses tested. Diazepam also increased turning behaviour. The suitability of the test for measuring effects of drugs upon gross motor behaviour in the guinea-pig is discussed.", 
    "49": "Changes in arterial gas tensions were determined in 114 patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations with standard or pediatric gastroscopes or colonoscopes. All patients were premedicated intravenously with 0.5 mg of atropine and 10 mg of diazepam. In addition, two thirds received a narcotic, either 50 mg of meperidine or 0.05 mg of the short acting drug fentanyl. The choice of instrument or premedication was usually sequential. There was significant depression of the arterial oxygen tension (Pao2), of 17.4%, immediately following premedication that included a narcotic but not with diazepam alone. Significant reduction of the Pao2 persisted during upper endoscopy if a standard gastroscope was used and meperidine or fentanyl was included in the premedication. If a narrow diameter gastroscope was employed, only meperidine was associated with persistent depression of the Pao2. To minimize hypoxia in elderly patients during upper endoscopy, no narcotic or only a short acting one should be included in their premedication, and a narrow diameter instrument should be used for the examination.", 
    "50": "A novel reverse-phase-ion-pair (RPIP), isocratic, high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation technique is presented for the analysis of all current parent benzodiazepines and their major pharmacologically active metabolites utilizing variable ultraviolet (UV) detection. In this RPIP technique, the counter-ion, methanesulfonic acid, forms an ion-pair or association-complex with the ionic forms of the benzodiazepines, which are then retained by the reverse-phase C8 column.", 
    "51": "In this paper, different aspects of gabaergic neurotransmission are considered, with emphasis on gaba neurones distribution in brain as well as various drugs interferences on these neurones. GABA agonists direct or indirect such as respectively muscimol or progabide and benzodiazepines or sodium valproate show anticonvulsant properties. These data support the hypothesis of the gamma aminobutyric acid implication in several neuro-muscular disorders especially in epileptic syndrome.", 
    "52": "Twelve normal volunteers were empanelled in an open-label, three-way crossover study to evaluate the influence of alcohol on the pharmacokinetics of controlled-release diazepam capsules. Each volunteer received one 15-mg diazepam controlled-release capsule alone, concomitantly with alcohol or followed by alcohol 2 hours later. The mean plasma concentration-time profiles following both alcohol treatments were superimposable on the profile from the control. The mean plateau concentrations were observed to endure from 2 through 12 hours in all cases. The mean +/- S.D. areas under the plasma concentration-time curves from time zero to infinity were similar indicating no difference in the extent of absorption of diazepam in the presence of alcohol. The harmonic mean elimination half-lives were also similar. Overall, the pharmacokinetics and the release properties of controlled-release diazepam capsule were not influenced by alcohol in normal volunteers.", 
    "53": "Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, was given intravenously in doses of 0.07 mg/kg as sedation prior to oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy in 40 patients. This was very effective as a sedative in elderly patients but less so in the young, with a large individual variation in response. Pain on injection and venous thrombosis which are common with diazepam were not seen with midazolam.", 
    "54": "One hundred chronic alcoholics, who were hospitalized in our ward for neurological disorders directly or indirectly due to a prolonged and continual consumption of alcohol, have been treated with tiapride in doses varying from 600 up to 1200 mg/die. The drug was administered either per os or by injection. 50 of these patients were given, at the same time, graded doses of alcohol per os. The purpose of this study was to analyse the preventive and therapeutical effects of the drug both on ten \"target symptoms\" examined separately, and on the onset and duration of the alcohol abstinence syndrome. We have noticed that decreasing doses of alcohol, in the first days of hospitalization, were unable to reduce significantly the onset of fits of delirium tremens. Tiapride showed a reasonably good therapeutical activity on some features of the \"target symptoms\": it shortened the average duration of the symptoms, while it did not prove better than benzodiazepines in inhibiting the onset of the same. The drug was unable to prevent the onset of the abstinence syndrome, and, even if it had a favourable control over the symptoms, it was unable to shorten their duration. The mortality rate was similar to that of other reviews where benzodiazepines, or major drugs acting on the nervous system, were employed. The sedative action of tiapride, even at higher doses, was insignificant, and its hypnotic effect almost absent. No extrapyramidal disorders have been observed, at least up to 1000 mg/die.", 
    "55": "EEG, EMG and clinical correlates of myoclonus due to poisoning are reviewed. The authors propose a classification into two groups. I. Sporadic diffuse asynchronous asymmetrical myoclonic jerks, responding to treatment. These states are encountered essentially in acute intoxication by vegetal poisons (strychnine), rodenticide (chloralose) and various medications (isoniazide, tricyclic antidepressant agent, lithium). These transitory manifestations are functional and prognosis is favourable. II. Subintrant generalized synchronous symmetrical myoclonus, uncontrolled by therapeutics. These myoclonus states observed over weeks or months are frequently consecutive to organic injuries due to direct toxicity (methylbromide) or after anoxia (toxic cardiac arrest). EEG and EMG correlations are very inconstant in both groups. EEG abnormalities are a sign of cortical and/or subcortical dysfunction. Normal EEG suggests a disease of the lower central nervous structure (brain stem, medulla). Chronic bismuth and dialysis encephalopathies are also related. Withdrawal syndrome with myoclonus jerks after sudden cessation of barbiturate or benzodiazepine long-term treatment is mentioned.", 
    "56": "The reaction of anthramycin with DNA has been examined to determine the chemical identity of the adduct which forms in a living cell and to observe the effects of the nucleosome structure of chromatin on drug binding. The chemical identity of the cellular adduct was probed by comparing various properties of the cellular adduct to properties of the known, in vitro adduct. The effect of the histones on anthramycin binding was investigated by time-course binding reactions. Results indicate that the properties of the cellular anthramycin-DNA adduct are similar to the in vitro adduct. The histone proteins associated with DNA in chromatin were found to decrease both the reaction kinetics and the final levels of anthramycin binding. Anthramycin reacts appreciably with nucleosome core DNA, but appears to exhibit a preference for linker DNA.", 
    "57": "Plasma cortisol suppression after dexamethasone administration in 113 consecutively hospitalized patients (54 patients with primary depression, 41 with secondary depression and 18 non-depressed controls) showed early morning hypersecretion of cortisol and cortisol non-suppression after dexamethasone mainly in patients with primary depression. The sensitivity of the dexamethasone suppression test was 79 per cent in unipolar and bipolar primary depressed patients, specificity 79 per cent and diagnostic confidence of a positive test 82 per cent. Non-suppression to dexamethasone was observed in 81 per cent of patients with psychotic depression but only 37 per cent of those with nonpsychotic depression. Age, sex and severity of depression, menopausal status, or benzodiazepines did not influence results. There was no association between cortisol non-suppression and any genetic subgroup of affective disorder.", 
    "58": "Myxoedema has been considered a major anaesthetic risk which could be increased by concurrent heart disease. Thyroid ablation with the production of myxoedema has, in the past, been used to control intractable angina. Eight ablated patients (Group I) and five patients with heart disease and incidental hypothyroidism (Group II) presented for open heart surgery. Management included diazepam-narcotic anaesthesia in generally reduced doses, careful monitoring and the use of digoxin, steroids and I-thyroxin given during or after operation. All patients survived. A number of the anaesthetic considerations and potential problems with myxoedema are discussed.", 
    "59": "In a double-blind crossover design, the effect of cimetidine on oral diazepam pharmacokinetics and an evaluation of cognitive function change was studied in seven healthy volunteers. Subjects randomly received placebo or cimetidine 300 mg orally every 6 h for a total of five doses prior to diazepam 10 mg. A significant increase in diazepam elimination half-life from (mean +/- s.e. mean) 66.9 +/- 21.4 to 89.6 +/- 22.5 h (P = 0.006) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 5.06 +/- 1.47 to 8.93 +/- 1.88 micrograms ml-1 h (P = 0.028) was observed indicating a probable cimetidine induced inhibition of diazepam hepatic metabolism. Digit symbol substitution and visual analogue scales were used to measure the effect of an alteration of diazepam kinetics on cognitive function. An enhancement of pharmacological effect as reflected in digit symbol substitution scores and visual analogue scale measurements was not observed.", 
    "60": "The influence of oral atropine or hyoscine on the absorption of oral diazepam administered at the same time was studied in eight volunteers using a three-way crossover randomized double-blind design. No difference was found in the timing of sedation or in the degree of sedation after diazepam alone or in combination with the anticholinergics. Diazepam serum concentrations were not significantly different after the three regimens. It is concluded that the anticholinergics can be given with diazepam for oral premedication without interfering with diazepam absorption.", 
    "61": "Diazepam and droperidol are used clinically with ketamine anesthesia to reduce emergence hallucinations, vivid unpleasant dreams, and hyperexcitability. Also, there are reports that the recovery time from ketamine anesthesia is shortened after administration of physostigmine. The authors investigated the influence of diazepam, droperidol, and physostigmine pretreatment on ketamine anesthesia by measuring the brain local regional activity and behavioral responses in rat. The 2-deoxyglucose brain local metabolic mapping method was used to determine regional brain functional activity. The recovery of tail flick response and righting reflex from ketamine anesthesia were prolonged by diazepam and by droperidol pretreatment, but the duration of agitation was shortened; physostigmine caused no significant change in any of these responses. Ketamine alone caused a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the rate of glucose utilization along the hippocampal molecular layer (control 87 mumol . 100 g-1 . min-1; ketamine 166 mumol . 100 g-1 . min-1) and a decrease in medial geniculate (25%), inferior colliculus (37%), and lateral habenula (18%). Diazepam, droperidol, and physostigmine pretreatment did not significantly alter any ketamine-induced glucose use changes, except for a decreased activity in hippocampal molecular layer with diazepam pretreatment (20%) and an increased activity in the lateral habenula with droperidol pretreatment (94%, P less than 0.05). These findings corroborate the \"epileptogenic\" character of ketamine anesthesia and implicate the hippocampus as a major focus. The reduced activity in the hippocampus induced by diazepam retreatment and the increased activity in the lateral habenula induced by droperidol pretreatment may be factors in the clinical reduction of ketamine hyperexcitability and hallucination by these drugs.", 
    "62": "We describe an efficient extraction and liquid-chromatographic method for separating commonly encountered benzodiazepine drugs and their pharmacologically active metabolites. After a single extraction of the drugs from serum, chlordiazepoxide, demoxepam, N-desmethyl-chloriazepoxide, diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, N-desalkylflurazepam, oxazepam, and prazepam can be resolved and quantified by using a C18 reversed-phase \"high-performance\" column and a ternary-solvent gradient system. Three separate solutions [60 mmol/L ammonium acetate (pH 7.69), 60 mmol/L acetic acid (pH 2.8), and acetonitrile] were incorporated into a gradient mobile phase such that changes in pH and solvent composition occur. Complete chromatographic resolution of the benzodiazepines resulted, permitting quantification of all within 15 min. The standard curve is linear to at least 8 mg/L for each drug, and the detection limit for each was 0.05-0.10 mg/L. The day-to-day precision for both high and low concentrations yielded CVs of 5 to 9%. Extraction of each drug from serum was 95 to 100% complete. Exogenous and endogenous interferences are minimal. Finally, we circumvented the instability problem of benzodiazepine standards in solution by using a simple reduced-pressure drying process that produces a working standard that is stable for at least nine months.", 
    "63": "Forty-one adult males volunteered for a study designed to investigate the thrombogenicity of the Valium\u00ae vehicle. Utilizing a standardized protocol, each subject received a sedative dose of Injectable Valium\u00ae in the antecubital fossa of one arm and an equivalent volume of vehicle in the contralateral arm. Both were administered with a continuous infusion drip of 5 per cent dextrose in water. Post-operative evaluation extended over 10 weeks and included clinical observation and palpation. Ultrasonic tests for occluded or impaired blood flow were performed with a Doppler Flowmeter.Five subjects (12.2 percent) had venous sequelae with the Valium\u00ae and two (4.8 percent) developed sequelae with the vehicle. The incidence of venous sequelae reported in the present study was considerably lower than in previous investigations (66.6 per cent and 37.5 per cent) utilizing the same protocol. The present study indicates that time of continuous infusion appears to contribute to thrombophlebitis subsequent to intravenous injection of Valium\u00ae. It also appears that the diazepam vehicle is not the major factor in the occurrence of thrombophlebitis.", 
    "64": "Twenty-four periodontal patients volunteered for a study designed to investigate the incidence of venous sequelae with Injectable Valium administered by a standardized conscious sedation technique. Sedative doses were injected into veins on the dorsum of the hand utilizing a continuous infusion drip of 5% dextrose in water. Postoperative evaluation extended over 12 weeks. Ultrasonic tests for thrombosis were performed with a Doppler Flowmeter. Independent variables considered included age, vein size, volume of drug, volume of intravenous solution, pain upon injection and initial venous flow velocity. Sixteen subjects (66.67%) experienced some form of venous sequelae. Thirteen sequelae advanced to thrombophlebitis. Those subjects who demonstrated no complications had significantly higher initial venous flow than those with complications. Those subjects with resolution of complications demonstrated a significantly greater initial venous flow than those without resolution of complications. Clinical variables of pain on injection, vein diameter, dose of diazepam and volume of infusion solution did not significantly differ across groups. However, those subjects with no complications were significantly older than those with complications. It is recommended that the larger veins of the forearm and antecubital fossa, with greater mean velocities of venous flow, be preferred for intravenous diazepam administration to attempt to decrease the nature and incidence of thrombophlebitis.", 
    "65": "1 Dose-ratios obtained with pirenzepine on the guinea-pig ileum at 30 degrees C are indistinguishable from those obtained at 37 degrees C. 2. In 0.1 M NaCl at 37 degrees C the pKa of pirenzepine for the loss of its last ionizable proton is 8.2. The ionization of pirenzepine is therefore markedly affected by changes in pH in the physiological range. 3 In experiments with pirenzepine on guinea-pig ileum and rat fundus made over a range of pH, the dose-ratio increases with the proportion of the protonated form present. As expected, the slope of the graph of dose-ratio against proportion protonated depends on the concentration of antagonist. The changes in pH produce only small effects on dose-ratios obtained with pirenzepine monomethiodide. These effects of pH can account for some of the differences between estimates of the affinity of pirenzepine. 4 The logarithm of the affinity constant of the protonated form of pirenzepine for the receptors in guinea-pig ileum is estimated to be 6.93, compared with 6.94 for the receptors in rat fundus. However, for the non-protonated form the values appear to be below 5 for the ileum compared with about 6.4 for the rat fundus.", 
    "66": "A combination of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline maternally administered as a single intraperitoneal injection on day 8 of gestation in the fetal hamster produced predominantly central nervous system anomalies including exencephaly and encephalocoele. In addition, omphalocoele, spinal flexion, and microcephaly were noted. A dose response relationship was found in which a maternal dose range of 13/33 mg/kg--33/83 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide/amitriptyline produced 7-92 percent fetal anomalies. Combination drug dose levels up to 23/58 mg/kg produced no maternal mortality. However, higher levels did result in a marked dose dependent mortality rate. The teratogenic potential of the combined drugs is much more pronounced than that of either drug administered alone since chlordiazepoxide at a maternal dose range of 280/3100 mg/kg produced 3-55 percent fetal anomalies, and amitriptyline at a maternal dose range of 60-100 mg/kg produced 6-45 percent fetal anomalies. The majority of these aberrant fetal developmental entities also were classifiable as exencephaly and encephalocoeles. Dose-dependent maternal mortality was observed at all dose levels for each drug administered separately.",

    "69": "Midazolam was compared with thiopentone as an intravenous anaesthetic induction agent in children between four and twelve years of age undergoing elective minor surgical procedures. Successful induction of anaesthesia was achieved in both groups of patients. With midazolam induction time was longer than with thiopentone, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of apnoea was greater with thiopentone, but not significantly so. It is concluded that midazolam is effective and safe, and could prove a reasonable alternative to thiopentone as an intravenous induction agent in children undergoing elective minor operations.", 
    "70": "Anxiety symptoms and plasma diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were assessed in 50 male outpatient veterans with primary chronic anxiety symptoms who had been taking an average of 17.7 mg of diazepam per day for a mean of 4.9 years. These subjects were moderately anxious (mean Hamilton Anxiety Scale score = 23) despite their chronic diazepam use. Although tolerance could explain this inadequate anxiolytic effect, the absence of a significant correlation between duration of use and either diazepam dose or any of the three anxiety measures argues against this hypothesis. The findings of modest diazepam dose and plasma concentration (mean=324 ng/ml) and of a trend toward a positive correlation between anxiety level and both dose and plasma level suggest inadequate dosage as a more likely explanation for the subjects' continued anxiety.", 
    "71": "1 Ethylenediamine, 31.6-1000 mg/kg intraperitoneally, inhibited the convulsive effects of pentylenetetrazol, 100 mg/kg (i.p.) in mice. 2 Ethylenediamine, 100-1000 mg/kg (i.p.) increased the convulsion threshold to the intravenous infusion of three convulsants in the order pentylenetetrazol greater than bicuculline greater than strychnine. 3 The benzodiazepine antagonist R0 15-1788, 10 mg/kg (i.p.), significantly inhibited the anticonvulsant action of diazepam, 50 micrograms/kg, but not ethylenediamine, 1000 mg/kg. 4 These results clearly indicate that ethylenediamine has anticonvulsant properties and are consistent with the hypothesis that ethylenediamine is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mimetic.", 
    "72": "1 In a double-blind, placebo controlled study, the efficacy of Ro 15-1788, a new benzodiazepine antagonist, in blocking the cognitive, psychomotor and subjective effects of diazepam, was investigated in a group of six healthy male volunteers. 2 The central effects of orally administered diazepam (40 mg) were most pronounced 1 h after dosing and persisted for 9 h with decreasing severity. 3 Concurrent oral administration of Ro 15-1788 (200 mg) completely prevented the impairment in cognitive and psychomotor function observed after diazepam alone. 4 The duration of action of Ro 15-1788 was shorter than that of diazepam. 5 Plasma diazepam levels after administration of the diazepam/antagonist combination were very similar to those observed following diazepam alone."
