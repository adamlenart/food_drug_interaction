    "0": "gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an emerging drug of abuse with multiple mechanisms of action. This study is part of an effort to examine the role of GHB, GABA(A), and GABA(B) receptors in the discriminative stimulus (DS) effects of GHB. In pigeons trained to discriminate 100 mg/kg GHB from saline, GHB and its precursors gamma-butyrolactone and 1,4-butanediol produced 80 to 100% GHB-appropriate responding, whereas other compounds such as morphine, naltrexone, cocaine, and haloperidol produced no more than 34%. Compounds interacting with GABA receptors produced different maximal levels of GHB-appropriate responding. For example, the GABA(A) agonist muscimol produced 3%; the GABA(A)-positive modulators diazepam, pentobarbital, and ethanol, and the GABA(B) agonist baclofen produced levels ranging from 54 to 73%; and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil and inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) both produced 96%. The putative GHB receptor antagonist (2E)-(5-hydroxy-5,7,8,9-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[a][7]annulen-6-ylidene ethanoic acid (NCS-382) produced 70% GHB-appropriate responding. The GABA(B) antagonist (3-aminopropyl)(diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP 35348) completely blocked the GHB-like DS effects of NCS-382 and baclofen at a dose of 56 mg/kg. CGP 35348 also blocked the DS effects of GHB, but incompletely and only at a dose of 560 mg/kg. Together, these results are consistent with a role for diazepam-sensitive and -insensitive GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors in the DS effects of GHB. Together with previous findings, the present results suggest that diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptors are more prominently involved in the DS effects of GHB in pigeons than in rats, whereas GABA(B) receptors are less prominently involved. Exploring the role of GHB receptors with NCS-382 is hampered by its GABA(B) receptor-mediated, GHB-like agonist activity.", 
    "1": "This review focuses on prenatal stress as a risk factor for psychopathology. Evidence from animal studies is summarized, and the relevance of prenatal stress models in animals for human studies is discussed. In the offspring of prenatally stressed animals, overactivity and impaired negative feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are consistent findings and may reflect a pathophysiological mechanism involved in the development of psychopathology. Reduced activity of the opioid GABA/benzodiazepine, serotonin, and dopamine systems and increased activity of the sympathico-adrenal system have been found as well. These alterations have been linked to a diverse spectrum of psychopathology. Therefore, the evidence supports the view that exposure to prenatal stress may result in a general susceptibility to psychopathology, rather than exerting a direct effect on a specific form of psychopathology.",

    "3": "The number of fatal poisonings between 1983 and 1999 in England, Scotland and Wales due to a single anxiolytic or sedative drug was obtained from the Department of Health in the UK. This was divided by the number of prescriptions for these drugs in England and Scotland to derive a fatal toxicity index (FTI) of deaths per million prescriptions.", 
    "4": "Chloral hydrate, clomethiazole, barbiturates, and related sedatives had much higher FTIs than benzodiazepines, buspirone, zolpidem and zopiclone. There has been a substantial reduction in the annual number of deaths from sedative drug poisoning between 1983 and 1999. This has been due to a sustained reduction in prescriptions for high toxicity drugs and more recently a major reduction in temazepam deaths that coincided with the withdrawal of gelatin capsule formulations.", 
    "5": "Deaths would be expected to be further reduced if there were reduced prescriptions of high toxicity drugs--and the continuing need for short-acting barbiturates, clomethiazole and chloral hydrate should be questioned.", 
    "6": "Sedative agents are widely used in the management of patients with head injury. These drugs can facilitate assisted ventilation and may provide useful reductions in cerebral oxygen demand. However, they may compromise cerebral oxygen delivery via their cardiovascular effects. In addition, individual sedative agents have specific and sometimes serious adverse effects. This review focuses on the different classes of sedative agents used in head injury, with a discussion of their role in the context of clinical pathophysiology. While there is no sedative that has all the desirable characteristics for an agent in this clinical setting, careful titration of dose, combination of agents, and a clear understanding of the pathophysiology and pharmacology of these agents will allow safe sedative administration in head injury.", 
    "7": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) was first described in 1672 but it is only recently that this disorder has attracted attention in defining its phenotype, and identifying its aetiology, pathogenesis and pharmacological treatment. RLS can be divided into primary (idiopathic) and secondary forms. RLS is common, affecting 5-15% of the total population and manifesting at any age from childhood to late adulthood. Prevalence tends to increase with patient age and there may be geographic variation. There is a clear genetic contribution to primary RLS and evidence for dopaminergic dysfunction. Although not all patients with RLS require medication, there can be a substantial reduction in the patient's quality of life related to pain, poor sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. A variety of medications are now available for the symptomatic treatment of RLS. Dopaminergic therapy is currently the treatment of choice, usually initiated with a long-acting dopamine agonist, thereby avoiding some of the complications associated with levodopa. Anticonvulsants may be used as second-line treatment. Levodopa should be reserved for those patients who fail to respond to alternative medications because of the high risk of inducing augmentation. Hypnosedatives also have a role in RLS management. Patients with intractable RLS may require combination treatment. Several systemic disorders can cause RLS, and these should be identified and treated appropriately.", 
    "8": "The impact of the surface-active formulation ingredients Cremophor EL, Tween 80 and Solutol HS 15 on the intrinsic clearance (Clint) of midazolam (MDZ) was investigated in rat hepatocytes and microsomes. In rat hepatocytes with 0.003%, 0.03% and 0.3% (w/v) Solutol HS 15 already present in the incubation medium, the Clint was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner by about 25%, 30% and 50%, respectively. In the presence of Cremophor EL and Tween 80 a significant reduction in Clint by about 30% and 25%, respectively, was observed at 0.03% surfactant concentration. At 0.3% of Cremophor EL and Tween 80, Clint was reduced by about 50% and 20%, respectively. A reduction in Clint was also observed in experiments with rat liver microsomes. At surfactant concentrations up to 0.03%, cytotoxicity assays (lactate dehydrogenase release, adenosine triphosphate content) as well as light microscope investigations did not reveal any cytotoxic impact of the surfactants on the hepatocyte monolayer. A potential interaction of the surfactants with biological membranes was determined using phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol liposomes loaded with self-quenching concentrations of carboxyfluorescein. No marked release of carboxyfluorescein from the liposomes (that would be an indication for a surfactant-dependent disruption of membrane integrity) was observed up to concentrations of 0.03% of the different surfactants. It is concluded that cytochrome P450 3A mediated metabolism of MDZ seems to be prevented by all surfactants at concentrations above 0.03%. In our experiments the surfactants did not show toxic effects at concentrations that resulted in a decreased Clint of MDZ. Thus, a direct inhibition of the metabolizing enzymes, a molecular interaction with the microsomes as well as an alteration of membrane properties that did not yet result in a release of LDH have to be taken into consideration as reasons for the observed changes in the metabolism of MDZ.", 
    "9": "Although olanzapine is known as a widely used atypical antipsychotic there have been very few studies about its use in children and adolescents. Eight adolescent patients who were diagnosed as having schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and treated with olanzapine are reported in this case series. The patients were followed-up for 17.5 weeks in the range 4-26 weeks. According to the CGI improvement assessment at the end of the follow-up period, three of eight cases were rated as very much or much improved, three as minimally improved and two as not improved. Olanzapine was well tolerated by the adolescents in this case series except for weight gain. Our results suggest that olanzapine may be an effective antipsychotic for some psychotic adolescents and during olanzapine trials weight gain. Should be monitored.", 
    "10": "Adenosine is an endogenous purine with vasodilating and cardioprotective properties. Animal experiments have shown that some benzodiazepine-induced effects can be explained by potentiation of adenosine effects, via inhibition of the nucleoside transport system. The objective of this study was to determine whether the frequently used benzodiazepines diazepam and midazolam increase adenosine-induced vasodilation in the human forearm vascular bed, measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Adenosine (0.6, 6, 20, and 60 nmol/min/dl ForeArm Volume) was infused into the brachial artery with and without concomitant separate infusion of diazepam (21 nmol/min/dl, n = 9) and midazolam (23 nmol/min/dl, n = 8). Plasma concentrations of diazepam resp. midazolam at the end of the infusion protocol averaged 0.5 +/- 0.2 microg/ml plasma (1.6 microM) for diazepam versus 1.2 +/- 0.4 microg/ml plasma (3 microM) for midazolam. Intra-arterial infusion of the benzodiazepines did not alter baseline vascular tone, and had no significant influence on the forearm vasodilator response to adenosine. The adenosine-induced relative change in Forearm Vascular Resistance (FVR) was -3 +/- 7, -48 +/- 8, -75 +/- 6, and -85 +/- 3% in the absence and 3.5 +/- 11, -54 +/- 5, -74 +/- 5, and -82 +/- 3% resp. in the presence of diazepam (P > 0.1, repeated measures ANOVA, n = 9). Likewise, in the absence resp. presence of midazolam, FVR fell by 1 +/- 6, 55 +/- 5, 74 +/- 3, and 84 +/- 2% resp. 11 +/- 11, 59 +/- 2, 80 +/- 3, and 87 +/- 2% (P > 0.1, n = 7). Intra-brachial infusion of diazepam and midazolam resulting in forearm concentrations in the high therapeutic range does not augment adenosine-induced forearm vasodilation. A possible interaction at supra-therapeutic levels of the benzodiazepines can not be excluded from the present study, but lacks clinical significance.", 
    "11": "Gastric and sphincter motility evoked by intravenous injection of CCK-8 were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats. Digital ultrasonomicrometry was used to monitor pyloric (PYL), antral (ANT), corpus (COR), and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) movements while simultaneously measuring intragastric pressure (IGP) and, in some experiments, subdiaphragmatic intraesophageal pressure (sIEP). Intracrystal distances (ICD) were measured continuously between pairs of piezoelectric crystals affixed to the serosa of PYL, ANT, COR (circular and longitudinal), and LES. Consecutive intravenous injections of CCK-8 (0.3, 1, and 3 microg/kg) at 30-min intervals caused dose-dependent simultaneous tonic contractions of PYL and ANT, LES opening, and drops in IGP with peak changes at 3 microg/kg of -17.9 +/- 2.1, -7.7 +/- 2.5, 6.5 +/- 1.4, and -29.2 +/- 3.8%, respectively, whereas intravenous saline had no effect. Rhythmic contractile activity was inhibited by CCK-8. COR responses were not significantly different from vehicle controls for most metrics, and the direction of response for circular COR varied between preparations, although not for repeated trials in a single preparation. During the LES response to CCK-8, sIEP rose in parallel with drops in IGP, indicating formation of a common cavity. Recovery of LES ICD after intravenous CCK occurred more rapidly than recovery of PYL ICD, suggesting the importance of preventing simultaneous patency of gastroesophageal and gastroduodenal passages. The CCK(A) receptor antagonist devazepide (500 microg/kg intravenous) inhibited motion responses evoked by intravenous CCK-8. These data revealed CCK-8-induced gastric and sphincter activity consistent with retropulsion of gastric content.", 
    "12": "The urea-induced unfolding of 'N' isomer (occurring at pH 7.0) and 'B' isomer (occurring at pH 9.0) of human serum albumin was studied by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements. Urea-induced destabilization in different domains of both the isomers was monitored by using domain specific ligands, hemin (domain-I), chloroform, bilirubin (domain-II), and diazepam (domain-III). Urea-induced denaturation of N and B isomers of HSA showed a two-step, three-state transition with accumulation of intermediates around 4.8-5.2M and 3.0-3.4M urea concentrations, respectively. During first transition (0-4.8M urea for N isomer and 0-3.0M urea for B isomer) a continuous decrease in diazepam binding suggested major conformational changes in domain-III prior to intermediate formation. On the other hand, binding of hemin, a ligand for domain-IB and chloroform, whose binding site is located in domain-IIA remains unchanged up to 5.0M urea for N isomer and 3.0M urea for B isomer. Similarly, fluorescence intensity of Trp-214 that resides in domain-IIA remained unchanged up to the above-said urea concentrations and decreased thereafter. Absence of any decrease in hemin binding, chloroform binding, and Trp-214 fluorescence suggested the non-involvement of domain-IB and domain-IIA in intermediate formation. A significant increase in bilirubin binding prior to intermediate formation showed favorable conformational rearrangement in bilirubin binding cavity formed by loop 4 of domain-IB and loop 3 of domain-IIA. Further, a nearly complete abolishment of bilirubin binding to both isomers around 7.0M and 6.0M urea concentrations, respectively, indicated complete separation of domain-I from domain-II from each other. From these observations it can be concluded that N to B transition of human serum albumin shifted the intermediate formation towards lower urea concentration (3.0-3.4M urea for B isomer as against 4.8-5.2M urea for N isomer). Further both the intermediates were found to possess similar alpha-helical (approximately 39%) content and ligand binding properties.",

    "15": "Animal studies of short-term progesterone administration and withdrawal model the natural increase and abrupt decrease in progesterone levels which occur in the late luteal phase (LP) of the human menstrual cycle (MC). Previously, studies in animals have shown that abrupt cessation of chronic or short-term progesterone administration results in pharmacological changes at the GABAA receptor, resulting in altered sensitivity to GABAA receptor neuromodulators such as benzodiazepines and flumazenil, a GABAA receptor antagonist.", 
    "16": "This study's goal was to compare the response to flumazenil in the follicular phase (FP) and late LP in female healthy controls (HCs).

    "20": "The objective of the present study was to examine characteristics of benzodiazepine (BZD) users, as well as try to identify predictors of continuing BZD use. Health-related data were collected twice on the same sample of Canadians two years apart. Drug use was based on the question: \"What medications did you take over the last two days?\" while other variables used were age, sex, education, marital status, chronic conditions, non-BZD drug use, health status and pain level. Of the 11,624 respondents, 371 (3.2%) reported taking BZDs in 1994. Logistic regression results showed that the highest odds of BZD use were for antidepressant users (OR=10.7, P<0.05), followed by poor health (OR=5.0, P<0.05), pain (OR=3.9, P<0.05) and chronic conditions (OR=3.2, P<0.05). Of the 371 individuals who reported BZD use in 1994, 198 (53.4%) reported BZD use in 1996. Logistic regression showed that none of the variables mentioned above showed a significant association with continuing (including gaps in use) BZD use in 1996. Regarding individual BZDs, it could not be concluded definitively that any BZD is more likely to show continued use than any other, but the possibility of a linear relationship between the proportion of continued use and the half-life of the BZD should be investigated further. Thus, the main predictive factor for continuing use of BZD, as shown by this study, is that of previous use. Whenever a BZD is prescribed, regardless of whether it is a new or repeat prescription, it should be remembered that the likelihood of continuing use is considerable.", 
    "21": "Although the effective evaluation and management of agitated patients often receives less attention than other aspects of critical illness, it is among the most important and rewarding challenges that face critical care physicians. Key features of effective management include a thorough, organized search for potentially dangerous and correctable causes; a sound understanding of the pharmacology of analgesics and sedatives; and keeping a steady eye on appropriate management goals. In turn, the reward for excellent care will be shorter lengths of stay, more rapid liberation from mechanical ventilation, improved cognition, cost savings, and, perhaps, improved survival.", 
    "22": "Many drugs have been associated with QTc prolongation and, in some cases, this is augmented by concomitant administration with metabolic inhibitors. The effects of 6 antipsychotics on the QTc interval at and around the time of estimated peak plasma/serum concentrations in the absence and presence of metabolic inhibition were characterized in a prospective, randomized study in which patients with psychotic disorders reached steady-state on either haloperidol 15 mg/d (n = 27), thioridazine 300 mg/d (n = 30), ziprasidone 160 mg/d (n = 31), quetiapine 750 mg/d (n = 27), olanzapine 20 mg/d (n = 24), or risperidone 6-8 mg/d increased to 16 mg/d (n = 25/20). Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were done at estimated Cmax at steady-state on both antipsychotic monotherapy and after concomitant administration of appropriate cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) inhibitor(s). Mean QTc intervals did not exceed 500 milliseconds in any patient taking any of the antipsychotics studied, in the absence or presence of metabolic inhibition. The mean QTc interval change was greatest in the thioridazine group, both in the presence and absence of metabolic inhibition. The presence of metabolic inhibition did not significantly augment QTc prolongation associated with any agent. Each of the antipsychotics studied was associated with measurable QTc prolongation at steady-state peak plasma concentrations, which was not augmented by metabolic inhibition. The theoretical risk of cardiotoxicity associated with QTc prolongation should be balanced against the substantial clinical benefits associated with atypical antipsychotics and the likelihood of other toxicities.", 
    "23": "An antidepressant for use in the patient receiving concomitant drug treatment, over-the-counter medications, or herbal products should lack cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 inductive or inhibitory activity to provide the least likelihood of a drug-drug interaction. This study addresses the potential of 4 diverse antidepressants (venlafaxine, nefazodone, sertraline, and fluoxetine) to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. In a 4-way crossover design, 16 subjects received clinically relevant doses of venlafaxine, nefazodone, or sertraline for 8 days or fluoxetine for 11 days. Treatments were separated by a 7- to 14-day washout period and fluoxetine was always the last antidepressant taken. CYP3A4 activity was evaluated for each subject at baseline and following each antidepressant using the erythromycin breath test (EBT) and by the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam (ALPZ) after 2-mg dose of oral ALPZ. Compared to baseline, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine caused no apparent inhibition or induction of erythromycin metabolism (P > 0.05). For nefazodone, a statistically significant inhibition was observed (P < 0.0005). Nefazodone was also the only antidepressant that caused a significant change in ALPZ disposition, decreasing its area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC; P < 0.01), and increasing its elimination half-life (16.4 vs. 12.3 hours; P < 0.05) compared with values at baseline. No significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetics of ALPZ with any of the other antidepressants tested. These results demonstrate in vivo that, unlike nefazodone, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine do not possess significant metabolic inductive or inhibitory effects on CYP3A4.", 
    "24": "The modulatory effects of behavioral stress on [(3)H]flunitrazepam, an agonist for the central-type benzodiazepine receptor binding to the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, in borderline hypertensive rats (BHR) were examined. In repeatedly immobilized (for 2 weeks, for 2 h/d) BHR, enhancement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the receptor was observed to be potentiated. The percent enhancement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in BHR was higher than that in normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto rats. Pregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid that has been reported to be a putative endogenous modulator in the stress response, concentration dependently enhanced [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the receptor. Enhancement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding was observed to be potentiated by the same immobilized stress, and the EC(50) values of pregnanolone in BHR was significantly lower than those in controls and E(max) values were higher. From the above results, it can be concluded that neural modulation to behavioral stress, especially in GABAergic neurotransmission, is exaggerated in BHR. We propose strain-specific differences of stress reactivity as an important pathogenetic factor in psychosomatic disorders including stress-induced hypertension. This is supported by reports showing exaggerated cardiovascular and symathoadrenal responses to stress in BHR.",

    "38": "A model of schizophrenia, the chakragati (ckr) mouse was serendipitously created as a result of a transgenic insertional mutation. The apparent loss-of-function of an endogenous gene produced mice that, when homozygous, displayed an abnormal circling behavior phenotype. To determine whether this phenotype could be corrected by atypical antipsychotics, we compared the effects of clozapine and olanzapine on rotational turns and hyperactivity. Both of these drugs successfully ameliorated circling behavior and hyperactivity in homozygous mice. The increased motor activity of these mutant mice was both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that observed in wild-type animals treated with dizocilpine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that produces behaviors resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Mice either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutation also displayed enlargement of the lateral ventricles, which was accompanied only in the homozygous genotype by a loss of individual myelinated axons in the striatum and agenesis of the corpus callosum. These structural brain deficits were selective in that the nigro-striatal dopamine system was normal in these homozygous mice. In addition, two types of interneurons in the neostriatum, namely those producing acetylcholine or nitric-oxide synthase were also devoid of significant structural abnormalities. These results indicate that the ckr mouse mutant could be used as a possible animal model to study the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and suggest possible strategies for treating the behavioral aspects of this brain disease.",

Acute aripiprazole administration did not affect dopamine output, but produced moderate increases in DOPAC and HVA concentrations, in medial prefrontal cortex or striatum of drug-na\u00efve rats. Similarly, aripiprazole did not affect dopamine output but produced moderate elevations in DOPAC and HVA concentrations in the striatum of chronic aripiprazole-pretreated rats. Olanzapine produced comparatively larger elevations in dopamine, DOPAC, and HVA in both regions, which, in the striatum, were diminished after chronic olanzapine exposure. Aripiprazole reduced extracellular 5-HIAA concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum of drug-nai;ve rats, but not in chronic aripiprazole-pretreated rats.

Probable precipitating factors could be determined in 331 (68.7%) of the 482 registered falls. Acute disease or symptoms of disease were judged to be precipitating, alone or in combination in 186 (38.6%) of all falls; delirium was a factor in 48 falls (10.0%), and infection, most often urinary tract infection, was a factor in 38 falls (7.9%). Benzodiazepines or neuroleptics were involved in the majority of the 37 falls (7.7%) precipitated by drugs. External factors, such as material defects and obstacles, precipitated 38 (7.9%) of the falls. Other conditions both related to the individual and the environment, such as misinterpretation (eg, overestimation of capacity or forgetfulness), misuse of a roller walker, or mistakes made by the staff were precipitating factors in 83 (17.2%) of falls.",

Older age, Glasgow Coma Score of <15, spontaneous emesis, seizures, delayed presentation to hospital, and ingestion of tricyclic antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonitis. Paracetamol poisoning and female sex were associated with a decreased risk of aspiration pneumonitis with univariate analysis. Ingestion of alcohol, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and administration of activated charcoal were not associated with aspiration pneumonitis.

Several rationale proposals to increase the efficiency of described treatment modality are suggested: to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of new coming photosensitizers, to combine photosensitization with other treatment modalities in molecular level, exploring mechanism of apoptosis, to increase the efficiency of treatment by combination with ionizing radiation, hyperthermia or ligation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.",

Similarly, the mGluR5 antagonist did not modulate the antiseizure activity of carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital against maximal electroshock in mice.

The combinations of loreclezole (2.5 mg/kg) with valproate, clonazepam, or carbamazepine (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test. However, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature. Among several chemoconvulsants, bicuculline, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and BAY k-8644 (the opener of L-type calcium channels) reversed the protective activity of loreclezole alone and its combination with valproate. On the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and BAY k-8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam. The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L-type of calcium channels.",

    "82": "The transmembrane energy-dependent efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) limits a range of drugs from penetrating cells and deposits them into the extracellular space. P-gp is highly expressed in several normal tissues, including the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells in the brain of humans. In this study, we tested whether olanzapine distribution to tissues highly expressing P-gp or devoid of this transporter was similar in Abcb1a (-/-) mice lacking P-gp and control animals. At 1 h following the intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 microg olanzapine/g mouse, olanzapine concentrations were statistically and significantly higher in brain (three-fold), liver (2.6-fold), and kidney (1.8-fold) of Abcb1a (-/-) mice than those of the control FVB Abcb1a (+/+) mice, and not statistically different in plasma, spleen, or penile tissue. Similar differences were also found for the ratios of organ:plasma and organ:spleen between the two groups. This is the first report that the presence of the Abcb1a gene is an important factor controlling brain access to olanzapine. The finding that the brain penetration of olanzapine is limited by P-gp implies that the highly prevalent functional polymorphisms of ABCB1 in humans may be a factor contributing to variability in dose requirements for this antipsychotic drug.", 
    "83": "CCK type 1 (CCK1) receptor antagonists differing in blood-brain barrier permeability were used to test the hypothesis that satiety is mediated in part by CCK action at CCK1 receptors on vagal sensory nerves innervating the small intestine. Devazepide penetrates the blood-brain barrier; A-70104, the dicyclohexylammonium salt of N alpha-3-quinolinoyl-D-Glu-N,N-dipentylamide, does not. At dark onset, non-food-deprived control rats and rats with subdiaphragmatic vagotomies received a bolus injection of devazepide (2.5 micromol/kg i.v.) or a 3-h infusion of A-70104 (3 micromol.kg(-1).h(-1) i.v.) either alone or coadministered with a 2-h intragastric infusion of peptone (0.75 or 1 g/h). Food intake was determined from continuous computer recordings of changes in food bowl weight. In control rats both antagonists stimulated food intake and attenuated the anorexic response to intragastric infusion of peptone. In contrast, only devazepide was effective in stimulating food intake in vagotomized rats. Thus endogenous CCK appears to act both at CCK1 receptors beyond the blood-brain barrier and by a CCK1 receptor-mediated mechanism involving abdominal vagal nerves to inhibit food intake.",

Mood stabilizers including lithium and divalproex have been considered standard therapy for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder, but remission rates remain inadequate. Conventional antipsychotics have demonstrated efficacy for acute mania, but they appear to have little role in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Despite substantial evidence of efficacy and recent guideline recommendations, atypical antipsychotics remain underused for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Data from double-blind, controlled trials are available for a number of clinically meaningful efficacy measures, including improvement in manic symptoms, onset of action, response rates, remission rates, improvement in comorbid depressive symptoms, and induction/worsening of mania or depression. Atypical antipsychotics are effective both as alternatives to lithium or divalproex as monotherapy, or in combination with these mood stabilizers, in the acute and likely the maintenance treatment of mania. The atypical antipsychotics represent an effective and relatively safe addition to our armamentarium for the treatment of bipolar disorder.",

Eight patients were initially hospitalised for diseases unrelated to ethanol abuse i.e. 2 each for gun shot wound, myocardial infarction and stroke, and one each for pneumonia and gastroenteritis. One patient was going through withdrawal because of prodrome of viral hepatitis before he was hospitalised for uncontrolled agitation and delirium. Two known cases of mild essential hypertension on dietary therapy reported for agitation, abnormal behaviour, a single episode of tonic clonic seizure and hypertensive encephalopathy as they could not/did not get alcohol for 3 days. Three patients presented denovo with DT without concomitant illness. The other features besides delirium and hallucinations were tremulousness in 10, tachycardia in 12, fever in 3, diaphoresis in 2 and tonic clonic seizures in 4 patients. The symptoms fluctuated markedly at short intervals and 2 patients did not have any features of sympathetic overactivity. Altered hepatic biochemical parameters and ketonuria with normal blood sugar were noted in 4 and one patients respectively. Other biochemical parameters including serum electrolytes were normal. CT scan brain done for 5 patients revealed subdural haematoma in one. Cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) and EEG findings were noncontributory. All made good recovery with heavy doses of intravenous vitamin B complex, glucose and oral benzodiazepine. Short course of haloperidol was used in 2 patients. Two patients developed pancreatitis during follow up. All patients made complete recovery, and 8 patients have been followed for 8 to 12 months without relapse. The reason for hospitalisation in such cases is often unrelated to alcohol abuse; hence a detailed history of alcoholism is mandatory to identify those at risk as well as for prompt treatment and decreasing the mortality.", 
    "91": "Medication algorithms have been used extensively in treating psychiatric patients, while geographic variations among these reflect the local history of the practice of psychiatry in each region. Here we review algorithms used for mood disorders in Japan in terms of their utility, problems, and possible future development. The first Japanese algorithm for mood disorders was completed in 1997 by the Japanese Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project (JPAP). Development of the JPAP algorithm was evidence-based, giving major but not exclusive weight to clinical trial outcomes. Unlike others, the JPAP algorithm suggests possible addition of a benzodiazepine to first-line antidepressant treatment for major depression. When the first-choice antidepressant fails, the algorithm recommends monotherapy with another antidepressant over \"add-on\" therapy. Clinical problems with the JPAP algorithm include lack of guidance concerning how to change from one drug to another. Psychiatry in Japan provides less formal structure for post-graduate education and undertakes less communication with the general public than in many countries. This makes use of an algorithm important for improving quality of practice, provided that clinicians remain aware of the advantages, limitations, and problems of algorithms.", 
    "92": "Several factors have led to suggestions that anxiety and depression are actually the same disease: very frequently, they co-exist; there is an overlap of symptoms between the two conditions; a number of similar agents can be used to treat both mental states; the same neurotransmitters are involved in both anxiety and depressive disorders; and stress can predispose both. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown efficacy in a number of neuroses: depression; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders (panic disorder [PD], social anxiety disorder [SAD], generalised anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder). Furthermore, other drugs, for example, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are effective in treating both depression and some anxiety disorders. Yet some drugs are only effective in anxiety, for example, benzodiazepines, and this suggests that the two states are actually different. Despite the broad range of conditions that are treated by SSRIs, a number of differences are clear when SSRIs are used in depressive and anxious states. When used in PD and OCD, the effective dose of the SSRI is often higher than when used to treat depression. Furthermore, SSRIs often work more slowly in patients with anxiety compared with those with depression. In order to assess which serotonergic pathways and mechanisms are involved in these conditions, tryptophan depletion tests can be performed. Tryptophan is the precursor to serotonin (5-HT), so if the SSRI treatment effects are dependent on an increase in synaptic 5-HT levels, depletion will result in a relapse in symptoms. However, if the SSRI treatment works through post-receptor events, then tryptophan depletion will have little effect on the individual's symptoms. In depression, tryptophan depletion induced relapse in patients treated and controlled on SSRIs, but not in those recovered on noradrenergic agents such as desipramine. In some anxious states (PD and SAD), our work has shown that relapse was also experienced following tryptophan depletion, indicating that the SSRIs are acting via increasing 5-HT levels at the synapse in these conditions. However, other studies have found no effect of the tryptophan depletion test. This suggests that in OCD, SSRIs act post-synaptically and therefore have a different mechanism of action in OCD patients compared with depressed patients. In summary, although most SSRIs are effective in the treatment of both depression and anxiety, differences in dose, time to onset of action and, in some cases, mechanism of action are evident when treating the two conditions.",

    "94": "This review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).", 
    "95": "rTMS is a noninvasive way to stimulate nerve cells in areas of the brain. During rTMS, an electrical current passes through a wire coil placed over the scalp. The current induces a magnetic field that produces an electrical field in the brain that then causes nerve cells to depolarize, resulting in the stimulation or disruption of brain activity. Researchers have investigated rTMS as an option to treat MDD, as an add-on to drug therapy, and, in particular, as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The advantages of rTMS over ECT for patients with severe refractory depression are that general anesthesia is not needed, it is an outpatient procedure, it requires less energy, the simulation is specific and targeted, and convulsion is not required. The advantages of rTMS as an add-on treatment to drug therapy may include hastening of the clinical response when used with antidepressant drugs.", 
    "96": "The Medical Advisory Secretariat used its standard search strategy to locate international health technology assessments and English-language journal articles published from January 1996 to March 2004.", 
    "97": "Some early meta-analyses suggested rTMS might be effective for the treatment of MDD (for treatment-resistant MDD and as an add-on treatment to drug therapy for patients not specifically defined as treatment resistant). There were, however, several crucial methodological limitations in the included studies that were not critically assessed. These are discussed below. Recent meta-analyses (including 2 international health technology assessments) have done evidence-based critical analyses of studies that have assessed rTMS for MDD. The 2 most recent health technology assessments (from the Oxford Cochrane Collaboration and the Norwegian Centre for Health Technology Assessment) concluded that there is no evidence that rTMS is effective for the treatment of MDD, either as compared with a placebo for patients with treatment-resistant or nontreatment-resistant MDD, or as an alternative to ECT for patients with treatment-resistant MDD. This mainly due to the poor quality of the studies. The major methodological limitations were identified in older meta-analyses, recent health technology assessments, and the most recently published trials (Level 2-4 evidence) on the effectiveness of rTMS for MDD are discussed below. Small sample size was a limitation acknowledged by many of the authors. There was also a lack of a priori sample size calculation or justification. Biased randomization may have been a problem. Generally, the published reports lacked detailed information on the method of allocation concealment used. This is important because it is impossible to determine if there was a possible influence (direct or indirect) in the allocation of the patients to different treatment groups. The trials were single blind, evaluated by external blinded assessors, rather than double blind. Double blinding is more robust, because neither the participants nor the investigators know which participants are receiving the active treatment and which are getting a placebo. Those administering rTMS, however, cannot be blinded to whether they are administering the active treatment or a placebo. There was patient variability among the studies. In some studies, the authors said that patients were \"medication resistant,\" but the definitions of resistant, if provided, were inconsistent or unclear. For example, some described \"medication resistant\" as failing at least one trial of drugs during the current depressive episode. Furthermore, it was unclear if the term \"medication resistant\" referred to antidepressants only or to combinations of antidepressants and other drug augmentation strategies (such as neuroleptics, benzodiazepine, carbamazepine, and lithium). Also variable was the type of depression (i.e., unipolar and/or bipolar), if patients were inpatients or outpatients, if they had psychotic symptoms or no psychotic symptoms, and the chronicity of depression. Dropouts or withdrawals were a concern. Some studies reported that patients dropped out, but provided no further details. Intent-to-treat analysis was not done in any of the trials. This is important, because ignoring patients who drop out of a trial can bias the results, usually in favour of the treatment. This is because patients who withdraw from trials are less likely to have had the treatment, more likely to have missed their interim checkups, and more likely to have experienced adverse effects when taking the treatment, compared with patients who do not withdraw. (1) Measurement of treatment outcomes using scales or inventories makes interpreting results and drawing conclusions difficult. The most common scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) is based on a semistructured interview. Some authors (2) reported that rating scales based on semistructured interviews are more susceptible to observation bias than are self-administered questionnaires such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

(3) argued that the lack of consistency in effect as determined by the 2 scales (a positive result after 2 weeks of treatment as measured by the HDRS and a negative result for the BDI) makes definitive conclusions about the nature of the change in mood of patients impossible. It was suggested that because of difficulties interpreting results from psychometric scales, (4) and the subjective or unstable character of MDD, other, more objective, outcome measures such as readmission to hospital, time to hospital discharge, time to adjunctive treatment, and time off work should be used to assess rTMS for the treatment of depression. A placebo effect could have influenced the results. Many studies reported response rates for patients who received placebo treatment. For example, Klein et al. (5) reported a control group response rate as high as 25%. Patients receiving placebo rTMS may receive a small dose of magnetic energy that may alter their depression. Short-term studies were the most common. Patients received rTMS treatment for 1 to 2 weeks. Most studies followed-up patients for 2 to 4 weeks post-treatment. Dannon et al. (6) followed-up patients who responded to a course of ECT or rTMS for up to 6 months; however, the assessment procedure was not blinded, the medication regimen during follow-up was not controlled, and initial baseline data for the patient groups were not reported. The long-term effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of depression is unknown, as is the long-term use, if any, of maintenance therapy. The cost-effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of depression is also unknown. A lack of long-term studies makes cost-effectiveness analysis difficult. The complexity of possible combinations for administering rTMS makes comparing like with like difficult. Wasserman and Lisanby (7) have said that the method for precisely targeting the stimulation in this area is unreliable. It is unknown if the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is the optimal location for treatment. Further, differences in rTMS administration include number of trains per session, duration of each train, and motor threshold. Clinical versus statistical significance. Several meta-analyses and studies have found that the degree of therapeutic change associated with rTMS across studies is relatively modest; that is, results may be statistically, but not necessarily clinically, significant. (8-11). Conventionally, a 50% reduction in the HDRS scores is commonly accepted as a clinically important reduction in depression. Although some studies have observed a statistically significant reduction in the depression rating, many have not shows the clinically significant reduction of 50% on the HDRS. (11-13) Therefore, few patients in these studies would meet the standard criteria for response. (9) Clinical/methodological diversity and statistical heterogeneity. In the Norwegian health technology assessment, Aarre et al. (14) said that a formal meta-analysis was not feasible because the designs of the studies varied too much, particularly in how rTMS was administered and in the characteristics of the patients. They noted that the quality of the study designs was poor. The 12 studies that comprised the assessment had small samples, and highly variable inclusion criteria and study designs. The patients' previous histories, diagnoses, treatment histories, and treatment settings were often insufficiently characterized. Furthermore, many studies reported that patients had treatment-resistant MDD, yet did not listclear criteria for the designation. Without this information, Aarre and colleagues suggested that the interpretation of the results is difficult and the generalizability of results is questionable. They concluded that rTMS cannot be recommended as a standard treatment for depression: \"More, larger and more carefully designed studies are needed to demonstrate convincingly a clinically relevant effect of rTMS.\" In the Cochrane Collaboration systematic review, Martin et al. (3;15) said that the complexity of possible combinations for administering rTMS makes comparison of like versus like difficult. A statistical test for heterogeneity (chi-square test) examines if the observed treatment effects are more different from each other than one would expect due to random error (or chance) alone. (16) However, this statistical test must be interpreted with caution because it has low power in the (common) situation of a meta-analysis when the trials have small sample sizes or are few.

    "98": "The psychostimulant drug modafinil induces a reversal of motor deficits in MPTP treated primates and prevents MPTP toxicity to substantia nigra but its mechanism of action is not clear. In common marmosets acutely treated with MPTP in the presence or absence of modafinil, we have studied changes in GABA(A) receptor binding in the basal ganglia. MPTP treatment had no effect on [(3)H]-flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding density in the striatum or external globus pallidus (GPe) but increased [(3)H]-FNZ binding density in the internal globus pallidus (GPi). Administration of modafinil (10-100 mg/kg) with MPTP did not alter [(3)H]-FNZ binding density in the striatum or GPe. Low doses of modafinil (10 and 30 mg/kg) had no effect on the increased [(3)H]-FNZ binding density in the GPi but high dose modafinil (100 mg/kg) significantly decreased [(3)H]-FNZ binding density in GPi. These findings suggest that modafinil can selectively alter GABA binding density in the GPi either by preventing MPTP-induced toxicity or through an action on striatal output pathway related to its antiparkinsonian activity and its ability to inhibit MPTP toxicity.",

It is widely distributed in mammalian tissues and body fluids, and exhibit some species and tissue variations. Several components selectively inhibiting MAO A, MAO B, central and peripheral benzodiazepine binding (tribulins A, B, BZc and BZp, respectively) have been recognised. Tribulin A represents some tissue-specific metabolites of trace amines, whereas isatin is the major component of tribulin B. Tribulin content increases in brain under conditions of stress and anxiety and is reduced under sedation. Changes in tribulin content in the brain are accompanied by corresponding changes in the content of monoamines and their acidic metabolites, and also by altered susceptibility of MAO to specific mechanism-based inhibitors. This suggests that tribulin is involved in MAO inhibitory regulation in vivo.",

These three subgroups were compared with a control group of healthy subjects (n=30) which were matched regarding sex and age. Diagnoses of patients were schizophrenia (DSM-IV 295.xx, n=61), brief psychotic disorder (DSM-IV 298.8, n=9), schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV 295.70, n=8) and delusional disorder (DSM-IV 297.1, n=3). There were no statistically significant differences regarding demographic characteristics between the groups. Digital EEG recordings were retrieved from a database and visually assessed by two independent investigators, and one blinded regarding medication. One patient from the quetiapine group (5%), 13 olanzapine patients (35%), five of the haloperidol patients (23%) and two subjects of the control group (7%) had an abnormal EEG. Epileptiform activity was observed in four patients (11%) of the olanzapine group, and none in the others. EEG abnormalities were statistically significantly increased with dose in the olanzapine group, in contrast to patients treated with haloperidol, quetiapine or healthy subjects. In conclusion, EEG abnormalities seem to occur rarely in patients treated with quetiapine comparable to the control group, but significantly more often with haloperidol and olanzapine, possibly due to different receptor profiles of these substances. To our knowledge, this is the first electrophysiological investigation comparing the new atypical antipsychotics quetiapine, haloperidol, olanzapine with healthy subjects.",

In contrast, the effects of chronic BZP treatment on the HPA axis have not been well studied, especially in the geriatric population. This study examined the acute and chronic effects (3 weeks) of alprazolam and lorazepam on plasma cortisol in 68 subjects (60-83 years) who received 0.25 or 0.50 mg b.i.d. alprazolam, or 0.50 or 1.0 mg b.i.d. lorazepam, or placebo orally according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. Memory assessment and blood samples for plasma cortisol were obtained prior to the morning dose on days 0, 7, 14, and 21, and at 1, 2.5, and 5 h postdrug on days 0 and 21. Assessments of anxiety and depression were carried out at days 0, 7, 14, and 21 before drug administration. Plasma cortisol was affected compared to placebo only by the 0.5 mg alprazolam dose. During the first and the last day of treatment, there was a significant drop in cortisol at 2.5 h after alprazolam compared to placebo. The predose cortisol levels increased significantly during chronic alprazolam treatment, and correlations were found between these cortisol changes and changes in depression, anxiety, and memory scores. These findings suggest that even a short period of chronic treatment with alprazolam, but not lorazepam, may result in interdose HPA axis activation in the elderly, consistent with drug withdrawal. If confirmed, this effect may contribute to an increased risk for drug escalation and dependence during chronic alprazolam treatment.", 
    "116": "LY354740 is a potent and selective agonist for group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, with anxiolytic activity in several animal models of anxiety, including the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Here, we studied neuronal activation in mouse brain after EPM exposure in saline- and LY354740-treated mice using c-Fos immunoreactivity as a marker. The effect of LY354740 on c-Fos expression was also studied in cage control (no EPM) mice. Pretreatment with LY354740 (20 mg/kg, s.c.) produced robust anxiolytic behavior on the EPM. LY354740 administration decreased EPM-induced increases in c-Fos expression in the CA3 of the hippocampus, while having no significant effects on basal c-Fos expression in the hippocampus. LY354740 administration significantly increased c-Fos expression in specific limbic regions, including the lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeL), lateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, and Edinger-Westphal nucleus, whether or not animals were exposed to the EPM. Moreover, LY354740 administration per se significantly increased c-Fos expression in regions processing sensory information, including the paraventricular and lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus as well as the nucleus of the optic tract and superior colliculus. In particular, the suppression of fear-evoked neuronal activity in the hippocampus and drug-induced increases in neuronal activation in the CeL have been previously linked to the anxiolytic effects of clinically effective drugs such as benzodiazepines, and thus may contribute to anxiolytic actions of LY354740 in animal models and human anxiety patients.",

    "129": "Previous studies have shown that leptin can regulate the adrenocortical axis. Neonatal rodents exhibit a period of adrenal hyporesponsiveness to stress in the first 2 wk of life, and we determined the role of leptin as a mediator of this process. We examined the direct effects of leptin on neonatal adrenal steroidogenic responses to ACTH under basal conditions and after 24-h maternal separation. In isolated adrenocortical cells from as early as postnatal d 5 (PND5) and throughout the neonatal period, acute (2.5 h) incubation with leptin significantly inhibited ACTH-stimulated corticosterone and aldosterone secretion without affecting cAMP production. In PND10 pups, 24-h maternal separation and the resulting rapid decline in plasma leptin levels increased basal corticosterone and aldosterone secretion in vivo and in isolated cells, but did not modify the ability of leptin to inhibit stimulated steroid production in vitro. Maternal separation in PND10 pups increased adrenal expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) proteins as well as all steroidogenic enzymes measured (3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, P450C11B1, and P450C11B2). Leptin (1 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) replacement during maternal separation did not affect basal corticosterone output, but reduced corticosterone secretion and StAR and PBR protein expression induced by exogenous ACTH challenge (20 or 80 microg/kg body weight, i.p.). These results indicate that leptin inhibits ACTH-stimulated secretion of corticosterone and aldosterone, at least through a rapid reduction in the expression of StAR and PBR protein in the neonatal adrenal gland. As leptin concentrations in pups are controlled to a large extent by the maternal diet, these results emphasize the key role of leptin to mediate the maternal influence on the adrenocortical axis of the infant.",

First, we performed electron microscopic analysis that for the first time unambiguously demonstrated the localization of the PBR on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Second, focusing our analysis on human tissues for which information on PBR expression is sparse (lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, thyroid, adrenal gland, pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary), we found that PBR exhibits selective localization.

This has prompted the search for therapeutic alternatives for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus clozapine in schizophrenic patients who failed to respond adequately to antipsychotic medication or who experienced intolerable adverse effects associated with the medication. This 18-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel study compared treatment with either olanzapine (5-25 mg/day, n=75) or clozapine (100-500 mg/day, n=72) in patients with schizophrenia who were nonresponsive to, or intolerant of, standard acceptable antipsychotic therapy. At the 18-week endpoint, no statistically significant differences were found between olanzapine and clozapine in any efficacy measure used: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative, or general psychopathology or Clinical Global Impression severity (CGI-S). Response rates based on the criteria of Kane et al. [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 45 (1988) 789] were also not significantly different between olanzapine-treated (57.9%) and clozapine-treated patients (60.8%). There were no significant differences in measurements of extrapyramidal symptoms or electrocardiography, and no clinically and statistically significant changes were seen in vital signs or laboratory measures in either group. Both treatments were well tolerated. Olanzapine demonstrated similar efficacy to clozapine in patients who had failed previous treatment because of lack of efficacy (treatment resistance) or intolerable side effects (treatment intolerance). Olanzapine therefore presents a safe alternative in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia.",

The second aim was to evaluate the effects of anxiolytics (i.e., diazepam and fluoxetine) on learning/memory abilities in the ORT following predatory stress. Results showed that predatory exposure impaired learning and produced amnesia of acquired information or impairment to retrieve learned information (48 and 96 h poststressor). The learning impairment in the ORT in stressed mice was restored by acute fluoxetine treatment, but not by diazepam that instead affected learning in nonstressed animals.

By a systematic pharmacological investigation of various GABA(A) receptor ligands, our aim was to gain a better understanding of the GABAergic mechanisms involved in different PTZ-induced seizures. We investigated anticonvulsant effects of various specific GABA(A) receptor ligands, which are believed to bind to different binding sites on the GABA(A) receptor complex, on PTZ-induced clonic seizures in drug naive and PTZ-kindled mice as well as their effects on the development of PTZ kindling. Diazepam and alphaxalone produced potent anticonvulsant effects and completely suppressed the development of kindling. In contrast, the antagonists bicuculline and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) displayed neither anticonvulsant nor antiepileptogenic effects. Flumazenil, often used as a reference antagonist at the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site, lacked anticonvulsant effects but surprisingly inhibited the development of PTZ-kindled seizures. The agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP) was devoid of both anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic effects. Marked differences in drug sensitivity were observed between models based on single and chronic administration of PTZ showing that the two sets of models are fundamentally different. These results describe the pharmacology of a set of ligands believed to bind to different sites at the GABA(A) receptor complex in animal models based on PTZ and demonstrate that a drug's action in these models cannot be readily explained by agonistic or antagonistic properties at the receptor level.", 
    "146": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are only minimally expressed in normal brain parenchyma, where they are primarily localized in glial cells. Their basal expression rises in different neurodegenerative disorders, due to the presence of infiltrating inflammatory cells and activated microglia. [11C]PK11195, a selective PBR antagonist, has been used for the in vivo PET monitoring of neurodegeneration in clinical observations. We recently developed and labeled with carbon-11 three new carboxamide derivatives: [11C]VC193M, [11C]VC195 and [11C]VC198M. Aim of this study was to evaluate these ligands for the in vivo measuring of PBRs expression in neurodegenerations and compare their kinetic behavior with that of the reference tracer [11C]PK11195. Radioligands were evaluated in a preclinical model of Huntington's disease consisting in the monolateral striatal injection of quinolinic acid (QA). Activated microglia and astrocytic gliosis was present only within the affected striatum. A concomitant increase in radioactivity accumulation was observed for all the tracers examined (P<0.01). Among the new compounds, [11C]VC195 showed higher levels of lesioned/unlesioned striatum ratios (3.28+/-0.44), in comparison with [11C]VC193M and [11C]VC198M (2.69+/-0.53 and 1.52+/-0.36, respectively), but slightly inferior to that observed for [11C]PK11195 (3.76+/-1.41).In conclusion, the results of the study indicate that [11C]VC195 is a promising candidate for in vivo PET monitoring of neurodegenerative processes but its in vivo behavior overlap that of [11C]PK11195.",

As the proportion of elderly people in our society is growing, the emphasis on high-quality care will receive increasing attention from administrators, politicians, organized groups, researchers and clinical nurses. Recent findings illustrate unequivocally the important contribution of nurses to achieving the goal of high-quality geriatric care. However, the quality of care for the elderly with psychological difficulties has not been addressed. The objective of this article is to illustrate that while nurses can accomplish much to improve the well-being and mental health of the elderly, their skills are often underutilized. Psychotropic drugs are often the first-line interventions used by health-care professionals to treat mental health concerns of elderly persons. Alternative therapies that could be implemented and evaluated, such as psychological counselling, supportive counselling, education and life review, are infrequently used. Nevertheless, current scientific data suggest that it would be very advantageous if nurses were to play a dominant role in the care of elderly people who are depressed or experiencing sleep pattern disturbances. The same can be said about elderly chronic users of benzodiazepines, as well as those with cognitive impairment. Evidence for the use of psychotropic medications as a viable treatment option for the elderly both in the community and in the long-term care setting who are experiencing mental health challenges is examined. Alternative non-pharmacological approaches that nurses can use to augment care are also briefly discussed.",

    "171": "Changes in the expression of subunits of the GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptor are implicated in the development of ethanol tolerance and dependence as well as in the central hyperexcitability associated with ethanol withdrawal. The impact of such changes on GABA(A) receptor function and pharmacological sensitivity was investigated with cultured rat hippocampal neurons exposed to ethanol for 5 d and then subjected to ethanol withdrawal. Both ethanol treatment and withdrawal were associated with a marked decrease in the maximal density of GABA-evoked Cl- currents, whereas the potency of GABA was unaffected. Ethanol exposure also reduced the modulatory efficacy of the benzodiazepine receptor agonists lorazepam, zolpidem, and zaleplon as well as that of the inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142, effects that were associated with a reduced abundance of mRNAs encoding the receptor subunits alpha1, alpha3, gamma2L, and gamma2S. Ethanol withdrawal restored the efficacy of lorazepam, but not that of low concentrations of zolpidem or zaleplon, to control values. Flumazenil, which was ineffective in control neurons, and Ro 15-4513 each potentiated the GABA response after ethanol withdrawal. These effects of withdrawal were accompanied by upregulation of the alpha2, alpha3, and alpha4 subunit mRNAs as well as of the alpha4 protein. Diazepam or gamma-hydroxybutyrate, but not baclofen, prevented the changes in both GABA(A) receptor pharmacology and subunit mRNA levels induced by ethanol withdrawal. Changes in GABA(A) receptor gene expression induced by prolonged exposure to and withdrawal of ethanol are thus associated with altered GABA(A) receptor function and pharmacological sensitivity.", 
    "172": "We have recently suggested that the elevated T-maze (ETM) is not a useful test to study different types of anxiety in mice if a procedure similar to that originally validated for rats is employed. The present study investigated whether procedural (five exposures in the enclosed arm instead of three as originally described for rats) and structural (transparent walls instead of opaque walls) changes to the ETM leads to consistent inhibitory avoidance acquisition (IAA) and low escape latencies in mice. Results showed that five exposures to the ETM provoked consistent IAA, an effect that was independent of the ETM used. However, the ETM with transparent walls (ETMt) seemed to be more suitable for the study of conditioned anxiety (i.e. IAA) and unconditioned fear (escape) in mice, since IAA (low baseline latency with a gradual increase over subsequent exposures) and escape (low latency) profiles rendered it sensitive to the effects of anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs. In addition to evaluation of drug effects on IAA and escape, the number of line crossings in the apparatus were used to control for locomotor changes. Results showed that whereas diazepam (1.0-2.0 mg/kg) and flumazenil (10-30 mg/kg) impaired IAA, FG 7142 (10-30 mg/kg) did not provoke any behavioral change. Significantly, none of these benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor ligands modified escape latencies. The 5-HT1A partial receptor agonist buspirone (1.0-2.0 mg/kg) and the 5-HT releaser fenfluramine (0.15-0.30 mg/kg) impaired IAA and facilitated escape, while the full 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) and the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist, SER 082 (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) failed to modify either response. mCPP (0.5-2.0 mg/kg), a 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor agonist, facilitated IAA but did not alter escape latency. Neither antidepressant utilized in the current study, imipramine (1.0-5.0 mg/kg) and moclobemide (3.0-10 mg/kg) affected IAA or escape performance in mice. The well-known anxiogenic drugs yohimbine (2.0-8.0 mg/kg) and caffeine (10-30 mg/kg) did not selectively affect IAA, although caffeine did impair escape latencies. Present results suggest the ETMt is useful for the study of conditioned anxiety in mice. However, upon proximal threats (e.g. open arm exposure), mice do not exhibit escape behavior as an immediate defensive strategy, suggesting that latency to leave open arm is not a useful parameter to evaluate unconditioned fear in this species.", 
    "173": "Increases in peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors (PTBR) have been utilized for the detection of neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in the brain. We have investigated the relationship between PTBR and NMDA receptor binding density in mice with closed head injury (CHI) using quantitative autoradiography. CHI was induced by a weight drop in nine mice, four of which received a single injection of the rat sarcoma (Ras) inhibitor famesyl thiosalicylate (FTS) 1 h after the insult. Sham controls received anesthesia but no contusion. The neurological status of the mice was evaluated at 1 h, and hence up to 7 days using a neurological severity score (NSS). Animals were killed 7 days after CHI and consecutive brain sections were incubated with [3H]PK11195, a PTBR antagonist, or [3H]MK801, an n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) use-dependent antagonist. CHI produced large (two- to threefold), widespread increases in PK11195 binding in the traumatized hemisphere and a significant decrease (20%-40%) in NMDAR binding limited to regions at close proximity to the lesion. Histologically, these regions were characterized by glial proliferation and neuronal loss. Significant increases in PTBR binding, but no concomitant decrease in NMDAR, were identified in several regions remote from the lesion, including the contralateral ventrolateral striatum and the ipsilateral ventral thalamus. Drug treatment significantly improved the neurological deficits but had only a marginal effect on PTBR. These results support a complex role for glial activation and PTBR increases in the context of CHI.", 
    "174": "The benzodiazepine (BZ) class of minor tranquilizers are important modulators of the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA(A))/BZ receptor complex that are well known to affect the spectral properties of spontaneous electroencephalographic activity. While it is experimentally well established that the BZs reduce total alpha band (8-13 Hz) power and increase total beta band (13-30 Hz) power, it is unclear what the physiological basis for this effect is. Based on a detailed theory of cortical electrorhythmogenesis it is conjectured that such an effect is explicable in terms of the modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission within locally connected populations of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. Motivated by this theory, fixed order autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models were fitted to spontaneous eyes-closed electroencephalograms recorded from subjects before and approximately 2 h after the oral administration of a single 1 mg dose of the BZ alprazolam. Subsequent pole-zero analysis revealed that BZs significantly transform the dominant system pole such that its frequency and damping increase. Comparisons of ARMA derived power spectra with fast Fourier transform derived spectra indicate an enhanced ability to identify benzodiazepine induced electroencephalographic changes. This experimental result is in accord with the theoretical predictions implying that alprazolam enhances inhibition acting on inhibitory neurons more than inhibition acting on excitatory neurons. Further such a result is consistent with reported cortical neuronal distributions of the various GABA(A) receptor pharmacological subtypes. Therefore physiologically specified fixed order ARMA modeling is expected to become an important tool for the systematic investigation and modeling of a wide range of cortically acting compounds.",

Nineteen percent of these respondents said that they had taken products to help with stress (11% had used benzodiazepines), 24% had used products to help with fatigue, 33% had used tobacco, and 20% said that they had experimented with cannabis. Finally, 44% of the respondents said that they had used products to 'hold out' during their studies--especially those presently taking products to assist with stress.

We identified, in a French medical-care database, 738 patients who had received at least one flunitrazepam prescription in January 2001, and monitored the hypnotics delivered to this cohort over a period of 8 months. Sixty-nine percent of the patients had replaced flunitrazepam by another hypnotic without any further change. The most surprising result of our survey was the discovery that nearly half of the selected patients stopped using hypnotics during the review period. Although many hypotheses can be offered to account for this phenomenon, it seems that many consumers halted their consumption of flunitrazepam as a result of the new regulatory regime.", 
    "177": "The aim of the study was to optimize psychopharmacotherapy in a big psychiatric hospital. It was conducted in Moscow Alekseev psychiatric hospital No 1, using a method of comparison of standard psychotropic treatment and medication strategy suggested by the expert group. An analysis of the treatment of 966 patients with different mental disorders revealed that 78.3% were in need of neuroleptic assignment that was in line with routine practice. The expert's conclusions were postulated as follows: a need in phenothyazines is significantly lower than that observed in practice. Xantens and tyoxantens (chlorprothixene, flupentixol, zuclopenthixol, zuclopenthixol decanoate, zuclopenthixol acetate), benzamides (sulpiride) and such atypical antipsychotics as risperidone, olanzapine and quentiapine are underused in the treatment. Comparing to usual practice, more patients (35.8%) need antidepressants treatment. Thymoleptics should be assigned in greater daily doses. Selective inhibitors of serotonin reuptake (paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline), reversible MAO A inhibitors (pyrazidolum), \"double-action\" drugs (mirtazapine, milnacipran) are recommended for wider usage. Less patients (33.4%) are in need of tranquilizers, though a number of medications used is consistent with a recommended one. Normothymics may be assigned to essentially less part of the patients and 18% of them need nootropics that is consistent with routine practice.",

No associations were found between the DRD3 and DAT polymorphisms and schizophrenia. The S/S genotype and the S allele were more frequent in the non-responder patients (n = 28) than in the group of responders (n = 47) (cut-off: >20-point improvement in Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale). The patients with S/S genotype completed fewer categories and had more perseverative errors in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) compared with the S/G patients. The S/S and S/G patients did not differ in positive and negative symptoms, GAF scores, WCST failure to maintain set, and verbal learning. No differences in symptoms or WCST measures were observed in the patients with different DAT genotypes. These results suggest that the S/S genotype of the DRD3 is associated with worse therapeutic response and more severe executive dysfunctions in patients with schizophrenia.",

The present study used in vivo microdialysis to investigate the brain regional and dose effects of these drugs on extracellular monoamine concentrations in the rat prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens and striatum. In the prefrontal cortex, the olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (3/10 mg/kg, respectively) increased catecholamine concentrations to a significantly greater extent than either drug alone (dopamine mean+/-S.E.M. percent of baseline: olanzapine (120 +/- 12.4), fluoxetine (123 +/- 6.2), combination (185 +/- 8.8); norepinephrine: olanzapine (124 +/- 7.2), fluoxetine (126 +/- 5.0), combination (215 +/- 15.8)). The combination also increased serotonin concentrations to 156 +/- 11.0% of baseline, but to a lesser extent than fluoxetine alone (210 +/- 14.5%). Similar synergistic effects of the combination were observed in the hypothalamus, but not in the other regions studied. The dose response effects of the drugs alone and in combination were complex, but larger doses of the combinations produced greater monoamine concentration increases than smaller dose combinations. The effects of the olanzapine/fluoxetine combination are meaningful in prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus due to their hypothesized role in the etiology and pharmacotherapy of depression. The wide-ranging neurochemical effects of this drug combination may make it particularly useful as a treatment for complex, resistant depressions.", 
    "180": "Several recent studies have shown that reducing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission retards extinction of aversive conditioning. However, relatively little is known about the effect of GABA on extinction of appetitively motivated tasks. We examined the effect of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), a classical benzodiazepine (BZ) and two novel subtype-selective BZs when administered to male C57Bl/6 mice during extinction following training on a discrete-trial fixed-ratio 5 (FR5) food reinforced lever-press procedure. Initially CDP had no effect, but after several extinction sessions CDP significantly facilitated extinction, i.e. slowed responding, compared with vehicle-treated mice. This effect was not due to drug accumulation because mice switched from vehicle treatment to CDP late in extinction showed facilitation immediately. Likewise, this effect could not be attributed to sedation because the dose of CDP used (15 mg/kg i.p.) did not suppress locomotor activity. The two novel subtype-selective BZ partial agonists, L-838417 and TP13, selectively facilitated extinction in similar fashion to CDP. The non-GABAergic anxiolytic buspirone was also tested and found to have similar effects when administered at a non-sedating dose. These studies demonstrate that GABA-mediated processes are important during extinction of an appetitively motivated task, but only after the animals have experienced several extinction sessions."
