    "0": "The 7-nitrobenzodiazepine derivative clonazepam is initially biotransformed by nitroreduction, followed by acetylation. Neither the amino- nor the acetamido- metabolites appear to have important pharmacologic activity. Clonazepam elimination half-life falls in the range of 20 to 80 hours, but means within the population and variance are not well defined. Absorption of orally administered clonazepam is 80% or more. In experimental studies, clonazepam appears to diffuse passively from plasma into brain, with a constant brain-plasma concentration ratio. The drug disappears in a parallel fashion from both brain and plasma, with no evidence of sequestration in brain tissue. Clonazepam has a relatively high molar affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor in vitro, and the fractional extent of benzodiazepine receptor occupation by clonazepam in vivo is directly and predictably related to the drug's concentration in brain tissue. Acute behavioral effects are in turn directly related to the extent of receptor occupancy. Compared to other benzodiazepines, the reportedly unique clinical properties of clonazepam are neither associated with unusual/unexpected pharmacokinetic properties or with a qualitatively different in vivo interaction with the presumed benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "1": "52770 RP, the N-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(3-pyridinyl)-1H,3H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]thiazole -7-carboxamide, displaces in a potent, specific and competitive manner [3H]PAF from its binding sites on rabbit platelets. Since 52770 RP is not structurally related to PAF and has low liposolubility with respect to PAF, it was selected as a potential radioligand for PAF receptor sites. [3H]52770 RP displayed high-affinity, specificity, as well as saturable and displaceable binding to a single class of recognition sites in intact platelets and crude platelet membranes. In these preparations, the values of binding parameters were, respectively, 8.5 and 7.6 nM for Kd, 0.2 pmol/5 X 10(7) platelets and 3.66 pmol/mg protein for Bmax and 0.96 and 0.91 for nH. Inasmuch as the (+)-52770 RP was 300-fold more potent than the (-)-isomer at displacing [3H]52770 RP in intact platelets, the studied binding site manifested stereospecific discrimination. A variety of pharmacological agents including pro- and anti-aggregant compounds did not exhibit affinity for [3H]52770 RP binding sites. In contrast, PAF, some of its active analogues and several recognized PAF antagonists (BN 52021, brotizolam, L-652,731, triazolam), displaced the [3H]52770 RP binding. Studies carried out using [3H]PAF demonstrated that 52770 RP was approximately 4- and 200-fold more potent than L-652,731 and BN 52021 respectively, as a PAF-receptor antagonist. In washed rabbit platelets, the rank order of potency (Ki) for several analogues of 52770 RP, to displace [3H]PAF from its binding sites, was highly correlated (r = 0.96) to their ability to antagonize [3H]52770 RP binding. In functional studies, 52770 RP antagonized not only the PAF-induced aggregation in washed rabbit platelets but also the hypotension evoked by PAF in the anesthetized rat. In this respect, it was 26 and 2 times more potent than L-652,731, respectively. In conclusion, [3H]52770 RP might represent a novel interesting tool for furthering our understanding of the role of PAF binding sites in pathophysiological processes.", 
    "2": "Novel ligands that bind irreversibly and selectively to \"peripheral\" type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) have been prepared. These compounds inhibit radiolabeled binding to PBR in the nanomolar range. The 2-isothiocyanatoethyl analogue of Ro 5-4864 (1-methyl-7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepi n-2-one) (5, AHN 086) was synthesized in three steps from desmethyl Ro 5-4864. The (+/-) (11a, AHN 070), R-(-) (11b), and S-(+) (11c) 2-isothiocyanatoethyl derivatives of PK 11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline-carboxami de) were each prepared in three steps from PK 11209 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid, 6). All four compounds inhibited radioligand binding to the PBR in brain and kidney. The R-(-) stereoisomer 11b was observed to be approximately 2.5-fold more potent than its enantiomer 11c; this is the first report of stereoselectivity in the isoquinoline series of ligands selective for the PBR. Furthermore, pH dependency studies showed that, at lower pH, change in the affinities for the PBR ligands is a property of the receptor, substantiating the hypothesis that a histidine moiety on the PBR is the most likely site for covalent bond formation, whereas, at higher pH, the observed changes in affinities can be attributed to properties of the compounds. All four of these novel ligands are potentially useful tools in the investigation of the PBR.", 
    "3": "A series of 1,3-diarylpyrazolo[4,5-c]- and -[5,4-c]quinolin-4-ones were prepared and tested for their ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam from bovine brain membranes. While the 1,3-diarylpyrazolo[4,5-c]quinoline derivatives showed affinity for the receptor site, their [5,4-c] isomers were devoid of binding activity.", 
    "4": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor is a site identified by its nanomolar affinity for [3H]diazepam, similar to the affinity of diazepam for the central-type benzodiazepine receptor in the brain. The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor occurs in many peripheral tissues but has discrete localizations as indicated by autoradiographic studies showing uniquely high densities of the receptors in the adrenal cortex and in Leydig cells of the testes. Subcellular localization studies reveal a selective association of the receptors with the outer membrane of mitochondria. Photoaffinity labeling of the mitochondrial receptor with [3H]flunitrazepam reveals two discrete labeled protein bands of 30 and 35 kDa, respectively. The 35-kDa band appears to be identical with the voltage-dependent anion channel protein porin. Fractionation of numerous peripheral tissues reveals a single principal endogenous ligand for the receptor, consisting of porphyrins, which display nanomolar affinity. Interactions of porphyrins with the mitochondrial receptor may clarify its physiological role and account for many pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "5": "The effect of midazolam on morphine analgesia was studied in 54 rats. Analgesia was determined by measuring threshold for motor response to noxious pressure applied to the tail. Midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the morphine-induced (1 mg/kg) increase in the reaction threshold by one-half. Flumazepil (Ro 15-1788), a specific antagonist of benzodiazepines, prevented inhibition of morphine antinociception by midazolam. These findings demonstrate that midazolam partially antagonizes the analgesic effect of morphine and, in addition, that the antagonism of midazolam on morphine analgesia is mediated by benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "6": "The effect of eight anions, including chloride, on the binding of gamma-hydroxy[2,3-3H]butyric acid (GHB) to synaptosomal membranes of rat and human brain was ascertained, as was the effect of a number of other allosteric modulators of the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxin complex. All ions which were active at the chloride ion channel, inhibited the binding of [3H]GHB in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum inhibition of binding being 60% of 300 mM concentration of anion. Inactive ions in this binding system included sulfate, acetate and fluoride, all impermeable to the chloride ion channel. The inhibition of binding was temperature-dependent, being abolished at 37 degrees C and was independent of the cation used. The binding of [3H]GHB was also enhanced by pentobarbital, picrotoxin and diazepam but unchanged in the presence of GABA, muscimol, bicuculline, baclofen or strychnine. These data raise the possibility that the epileptogenic effect of GHB may be modulated by an action on the chloride ion channel, that is tightly coupled to the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxin and/or GHB receptor complex.", 
    "7": "The function of chloride (Cl-) channel proteins is to regulate the transport of Cl- across membranes. There are two major kinds of Cl- channels: 1) those activated by binding of a transmitter such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, or glutamate, and thus are receptors; and 2) those activated by membrane depolarization or by calcium. There are two kinds of GABA receptors: GABAA is the major inhibitory receptor of vertebrate brain and the one that operates a Cl- channel, and the GABAB receptor, which is proposed to regulate cAMP production that is stimulated by other receptors. Except for binding of GABA, these two GABA receptors differ completely in their drug specificities. However, there are many similarities among the GABAA receptor, the glycine receptor, and the voltage-dependent Cl- channel. The two receptors and Cl- channels bind avermectin, whereas bicuculline binds only to mammalian GABAA and glycine receptors, not to the insect brain GABAA receptor. Barbiturates bind to GABAA and voltage-dependent Cl- channels, possibly directly activating them. Benzodiazepines potentiate both the glycine and GABAA receptors. Several insecticides act on the GABAA receptor and voltage-dependent Cl- channel. It is suggested that the GABAA receptor is the primary target for the action of toxaphene and cyclodiene insecticides but a secondary target for lindane and type II pyrethroids. On the other hand, the Cl- channel may be a primary target for avermectin and lindane but a secondary one for cyclodienes. The similarity in certain drug specificities and the operation of Cl- channels suggest a degree of homology between the subunits of GABAA and glycine receptors and the voltage-dependent Cl- channels.", 
    "8": "Effects of pirenzepine, a newly developed anticholinergic drug, on exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions stimulated by cholecystokinin octapeptide and secretin were studied in both isolated pancreatic acini and the isolated perfused pancreas of rats. In the isolated acini, pirenzepine did not have any significant effect on cholecystokinin-induced amylase release but caused an inhibition of amylase secretion initiated by secretin and shifted the dose-response curve for amylase secretion to the right. In the isolated perfused pancreas stimulated with 100 pM cholecystokinin octapeptide, addition of 10 microM pirenzepine before as well as after 20 min of perfusion significantly inhibited pancreatic juice flow but not enzyme output. In contrast, pirenzepine caused an inhibition of secretin-stimulated enzyme secretion, but not pancreatic juice flow. The stimulatory effect of both cholecystokinin octapeptide and secretin on insulin secretion was also inhibited by pirenzepine. The present data indicate that pirenzepine may have an influence on pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function by inhibiting endogenous cholinergic activity of the pancreas when a large dose is given.", 
    "9": "In order to study the efficacy of estazolam versus triazolam in preoperative patients, two groups of 49 patients each were treated with 2 mg estazolam and 0.5 mg triazolam in a single dose, the night before surgery. This controlled study was designed to evaluate sleep patterns, emotional status on awakening and side effects, by the administration of a questionnaire either in the morning of the day before (baseline) or on the morning of surgery. The results show better sleep patterns after estazolam excepting the duration of sleep that was the same for the two drugs. The better emotional status upon awakening in the morning before surgery and the lower incidence of side effects in the patients treated with estazolam, lead to the conclusion that estazolam is clearly better than triazolam in the treatment of preoperative patients.", 
    "10": "The effects of several calcium antagonists, including nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, on muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist binding were studied in the P2 fraction of the rat cerebral cortex using either [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) or [3H]pirenzipine as the radioactive ligand. (1) The potency of [3H]QNB binding inhibition was in the order nicardipine greater than verapamil greater than diltiazem greater than nifedipine. The IC50 values of nicardipine, verapamil, and diltiazem were 2.56 X 10(-6) M, 1.28 X 10(-5) M, and 6.00 X 10(-5) M, respectively. (2) The inhibition of [3H]QNB binding by nicardipine was significantly decreased in the presence of Ca ions. (3) In saturation experiments of [3H]QNB binding in the presence of nicardipine, the Kd value appeared to be significantly affected, but the Bmax value was unchanged. This indicated that nicardipine probably inhibited [3H]QNB binding allosterically. On the other hand, (4) nicardipine inhibited [3H]pirenzipine binding completely with an IC50 value of 7.87 X 10(-7) M. It was concluded that nicardipine had an inhibitory effect on M1-receptor binding.", 
    "11": "Treatment of either crude or purified preparations of the gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor complex with arginine-specific reagents resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of [3H]muscimol binding activity. Following exposure to either 2,3-butanedione or phenylglyoxal (less than or equal to 20 mM), [3H]muscimol binding was inhibited by up to 80%. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding was much less sensitive to the effects of the reagents. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that treatment with butanedione resulted in a loss of [3H]muscimol binding sites with little effect on binding affinity. Considerable protection against inactivation was provided by arginine and by the endogenous receptor ligand, GABA. These results indicate that arginine residues play a critical role in maintaining the GABA receptor in a conformation capable of ligand binding, possibly by participating in the binding site through interaction with the carboxylate moiety of GABA.", 
    "12": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes in longitudinal and circular smooth muscles of the guinea pig ileum were characterized with the use of the cardioselective antagonist AF-DX 116 in binding competition experiments against 0.3 nM [3H] N-methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS). This compound recognized a heterogeneous receptor population in both smooth muscles, revealing the existence of different percentages of the cardiac (KD = 92-110 nM) and the glandular (KD = 1150-2541 nM) muscarinic receptor subtypes. These results, together with the low potency displayed by AF-DX 116 to inhibit the agonist-stimulated smooth muscle contraction and salivary secretion allow the suggestion that the glandular muscarinic receptor subtype, showing a low affinity for AF-DX 116, is involved in smooth muscle contraction.", 
    "13": "The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values for [3H]PK 11195 binding were determined in the platelet membranes of epileptic patients before and after 4 weeks of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment, as well as in healthy controls. There was a decrease of 17.1% in the Bmax value of patients before treatment as compared to the controls whereas an increase of 50.3% was observed in CBZ-treated patients as compared to their pretreatment values. The up-regulatory effect of CBZ on peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was not accompanied by alterations in KD values.", 
    "14": "A single injection of the benzodiazepine triazolam, which is though to act by potentiating the effects of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can induce permanent phase shifts in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity of hamsters. Occurrence of GABA immunoreactivity and benzodiazepine receptors in the retina, which contains photoreceptors that relay synchronizing light-dark information to the mammalian circadian system, raises the possibility that triazolam may influence circadian rhythmicity via an action on the retina. However, the phase shifting effects of triazolam on the activity rhythm were unaffected by blinding: the direction and the magnitude of the phase shifts were similar in blind hamsters and in sighted hamsters maintained in constant darkness. Furthermore, no change in response to triazolam was observed in hamsters studied through 84 days after blinding. In addition, benzodiazepine binding sites have been found in the mammalian pineal gland, which has also been implicated in circadian rhythmicity. Therefore, its possible involvement in mediating the phase advancing effects of triazolam on the circadian clock has also been tested: the response was similar in blind and blind-pinealectomized animals. These results indicate that the effects of triazolam on the circadian clock are not mediated by the eyes or the pineal gland.", 
    "15": "A microcomputer-based system has been used to apply the technique of excitability testing to the study of the actions of a range of pharmacological agents on the excitability of single primary afferent terminals in the mouse spinal cord in vitro. GABAA analogues all evoked increases in excitability that were bicuculline sensitive. GABA itself also evoked biphasic changes in excitability, or occasionally only suppressed terminal excitability. This latter effect was often enhanced in the presence of bicuculline, and resembled the action of the GABAB agonist, baclofen. The GABAA action could be enhanced by concurrent application of either benzodiazepine, midazolam or flurazepam. Bicuculline alone frequently decreased excitability. This action could be abolished by blocking synaptic activity with a low Ca2+ high Mg2+ superfusate, and was therefore considered to be due to reduction of the tonic action of GABA released at synaptic connections. Comparison of the action of these agents on terminals in the spastic mutant mouse showed an increased sensitivity of the GABA response to the benzodiazepines in mutant animals.", 
    "16": "Previous work in our laboratory has shown that the Maudsley reactive (MR) strain of rats cannot be differentiated from the Maudsley non-reactive (MNR) strain regarding the number or affinity of their brain benzodiazepine binding sites. In the present study we show that the number of cerebellar adenosine receptors (as studied using [3H]cyclohexyladenosine, [3H]CHA, as the ligand) are increased by 15-30% in the MR strain. This alteration was corroborated by quantitative autoradiographic analysis and found to be localized to the molecular layer of the cerebellum where adenosine receptors are believed to reside on parallel fibers of cerebellar granule cells.", 
    "17": "The effects of excitotoxic lesions on the neuronal marker enzymes choline acetyltransferase and glutamate decarboxylase and on the levels of 'peripheral type' benzodiazepine binding sites (PTBBS) (a putative glial marker) have been compared to see whether PTBBS provide a suitable if indirect quantitative index of neuronal damage. Intrastriatal injection of excitotoxic compounds provoked a dose-dependent increase in the levels of PTBBS. The potency order was the following: kainate greater than AMPA greater than N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) greater than quisqualate. The maximal increases in this parameter were 400, 470, 320 and 210% for kainate (12 nmol), AMPA (100 nmol), NMDA (500 nmol) and quisqualate (250 nmol), respectively. 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate (100 nmol)--an antagonist of the NMDA receptor subtype--completely blocked the increase in PTBBS induced by NMDA (250 nmol), but was without effect against the other excitotoxins. Increases in binding levels were in general mirrored by a decrease in choline acetyltransferase and glutamate decarboxylase activity. However, PTBBS were a more sensitive indirect index of neuronal damage than neuronal enzymes because the alterations in binding were statistically significant at doses of excitotoxins lower than those causing a loss of marker enzymes. It is concluded that PTBBS are a suitable and sensitive means of detecting discrete neurotoxic changes and that its measurement will help in the study of other pathological and experimental models.", 
    "18": "The intrinsic effect of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists RO 15-4513 and FG 7142 on the behavior of mice in a holeboard were investigated. Both drugs caused dose-related decreases in exploratory head-dipping. The highest dose of FG 7142 (40 mg/kg) also reduced locomotor activity. RO 15-4513 (1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg) and FG 7142 (10 and 20 mg/kg) reversed the reductions in the number of head-dips caused by ethanol (2 g/kg). The higher doses of these two drugs also partially reversed the locomotor stimulant action of ethanol. Animals that received ethanol in combination with either inverse agonist spent less time head-dipping than vehicle-treated controls. These data indicate that FG 7142 and RO 15-4513 can reverse, at least in part, some of the behavioral effects of ethanol. Neither drug significantly altered blood alcohol concentrations suggesting that the antagonism does not result from pharmacokinetic changes.", 
    "19": "The effects of intravenous (i.v.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of morphine on jejunal and colonic motility were investigated in conscious dogs chronically prepared with strain gage transducers and compared to those of i.c.v. DAGO, a highly selective opiate mu agonist. Morphine i.v. (100 micrograms/kg) and i.c.v. (10 micrograms/kg) administered 3 hrs after a meal stimulated colonic motility for 3-5 hrs and induced a phase 3 on the jejunum, which appeared after a 15-60 min delay following i.c.v. administration. These effects were reproduced by DAGO administration at doses of 2 micrograms/kg i.v. and 0.2 micrograms/kg i.c.v. The effects of i.v., but not those of i.c.v., morphine and DAGO on jejunal and colonic motility were blocked by a previous administration of naloxone (100 micrograms/kg i.v.). The colonic stimulation but not the jejunal phase 3 induced by i.c.v. morphine and DAGO were blocked by RO 15-1788 (1 mg/kg i.v.), a selective benzodiazepine antagonist. The colonic stimulation induced by i.v. morphine or DAGO was not modify by i.v. RO 15-1788. It is concluded that i.c.v. administration of mu agonist involved benzodiazepine but not opiate receptors to stimulate colonic motility in dogs.", 
    "20": "Sixty volunteers with insomnia participated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. After an initial six nights of placebo, 30 subjects (the abrupt-withdrawal group) received 0.5 mg of triazolam nightly for 7 to 10 nights, after which they received placebo. The other 30 subjects (the tapered-dosage group) received the same initial placebo treatment, then triazolam at 0.5 mg for seven nights, at 0.25 mg for two nights, and at 0.125 mg for two nights, and then placebo. As compared with the initial placebo period, the triazolam period significantly reduced the interval before the onset of sleep (sleep latency), and it prolonged sleep duration, reduced the number of awakenings, and improved the self-rated soundness of sleep in all cohorts. In the abrupt-withdrawal group, plasma levels of triazolam were undetectable the morning after the first night of placebo substitution, and subjects reported prolongation of sleep latency (57 minutes longer than base line), reduction in sleep duration (1.4 hours less than base line), and increased awakenings (1.2 per night above base line). The symptoms of rebound sleep disorder lasted one or possibly two nights, and there was a reversion toward base line on subsequent placebo nights. In the tapered-dosage group, however, plasma triazolam levels fell gradually to zero, and rebound symptoms were decreased or eliminated. Thus, rebound sleep disorder following abrupt discontinuation of triazolam can be attenuated by a regimen of tapering.", 
    "21": "Carbamylcholine stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in mouse cerebral cortical slices with an ED50 value of approximately 70 microM. Increasing concentrations of the M2 selective muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, AF-DX 116 (0.3-3.0 microM). produced parallel shifts to the right for concentration-response curves to carbamylcholine. A pA2 value for AF-DX 116 of 6.5 (low affinity) was obtained from Schild plot analysis. It is concluded that the M2 muscarinic receptor subtype, as defined by high affinity [3H]AF-DX 116 radioligand binding, is not appreciably coupled to polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in the mouse cerebral cortex.", 
    "22": "The ontogeny of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) in the rat brain was studied with emphasis on the differentiation of M1- and M2-receptor subtypes through semi-quantitative in vitro autoradiography. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and [3H]pirenzepine (PZ) were used for labeling total mAChR and M1-receptors, respectively. In the cerebral cortex of adult rats, [3H]QNB binding sites were more richly present in the superficial and deeper layers than in the middle layer, while M1-receptors were diffusely observed in all the layers. This means that M2-receptors are highly concentrated in the superficial and deeper layers. The ontogenetical differentiation of the laminar distribution between M1- and M2-receptors first appeared at 14 days of postnatal age. In the hippocampus and striatum whose mAChR were predominantly of the M1-type in the adult rat brain, ontogenic patterns of M1-receptors were almost identical to those of total mAChR. On the other hand, mAChR in the cerebellar cortex and lower brainstem of the adult rat were mainly of the M2-subtype. In these areas, the ontogeny of total mAChR was apparently observed. However, M1-receptors were not observed at any stage of the ontogeny. The above-mentioned results indicate that M1- and M2-receptors show distinct developmental behaviors in the rat brain.", 
    "23": "The characteristics of the muscarinic receptor in isolated gastric fundic cells from rabbit were determined by radioligand binding techniques and functional tests. The dissociation constants (KDS) of selective (hexahydrosiladifenidol and pirenzepine) and non-selective (N-methylscopolamine and atropine) muscarinic receptor antagonists obtained in competition experiments vs [3H]-N-methylscopolamine were compared with the pA2 values of the drugs as inhibitors of carbachol-stimulated [14C]-aminopyrine accumulation (an index of acid secretion) in the gastric fundic cells. Good correlations were found between the ability of the drugs to inhibit acid secretion and their affinity for muscarinic receptors in the gastric fundic cells. The rank order of potency in both tests was N-methylscopolamine greater than atropine greater than hexahydrosiladifenidol greater than pirenzepine. The character of the muscarinic receptor subtype present on gastric fundic cells was established by comparing the affinity values of the compounds for this receptor with those for the receptors in other rabbit tissues. It was found that only pirenzepine and hexahydrosiladifenidol displayed tissue selectivity in their binding profiles. The KDS for pirenzepine were 13nM for the M1 receptor of the cerebral cortex and about 500 nM for the M2 receptors of the submandibular and gastric glands and heart. Differently from pirenzepine, hexahydrosiladifenidol showed about 10-fold discrimination between the M2 subtype of the gland (KD = 31 nM) and the M2 subtype of the heart (KD = 330 nM).", 
    "24": "Benzodiazepine (BZ) binding is being studied in the spinal trigeminal nucleus of the cat 3 and 11 days following unilateral retrogasserian rhizotomy using in vitro autoradiography and computer-assisted densitometry. At 3 days following rhizotomy there is an increase in number and decrease in affinity of flunitrazepam binding sites in the superficial laminae of subnucleus caudalis of the spinal trigeminal complex. By 11 days, affinity remains below control values and binding site number shows an insignificant but detectable increase. There is no change in binding site characteristics in deeper laminae at either survival time. The results are discussed in relation to the physiological hyperactivity and synaptic changes which occur following such lesions and to other conditions of deafferentation.", 
    "25": "The effects of diazepam on internal membrane potential and action potentials and the isometric twitch and tetanus have been examined in rat fast-twitch (extensor digitorum longus) and slow-twitch (soleus) fibres. Low concentrations of the drug encountered during clinical usage (about 10 microM) had no effect on the membrane electrical properties or contractile properties of the fibres. Higher concentrations of diazepam (100-800 microM) induced changes in action potentials and excitation-contraction coupling but not in the resting membrane potential. After exposure to diazepam there was a rapid, concentration-dependent increase in twitch tension, which was attributed to an effect on excitation-contraction coupling, since the action potential and membrane potential were not altered. Soleus fibres were most sensitive to the potentiating action of diazepam. The decay of the tetanus was prolonged in both types of fibre, which indicated that diazepam blocked calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Unexpectedly, the decay of isometric twitches was sensitive to diazepam only in soleus fibres, suggesting that calcium uptake was rate-limiting for tension relaxation in slow- but not fast-twitch fibres. The amplitude of the twitch and tetanus fell below control levels after prolonged exposure to diazepam, and there was a parallel reduction in action potential overshoot, especially during tetanic stimulation. Fast-twitch fibres were most susceptible to the depressant effect of diazepam.", 
    "26": "Midazolam meleate, a water soluble 1,4 benzodiazepine, was used intravenously in 20 patients suffering seizures, of whom 12 were in status epilepticus. In all cases, midazolam in a dose of 2.5-15 mg rapidly terminated the seizure. There were no complications from the use of midazolam. The causes of the seizures were varied but alcohol-withdrawal seizures were the single largest cause. Thirteen patients were taking some form of anticonvulsant medication but only three were in the therapeutic range. Midazolam is seen to be an effective agent in the emergency treatment of seizures.", 
    "27": "We studied the effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists, diazepam and muscimol, on the urinary bladder contraction induced by infusion of Tyrode's solution into the bladder in anesthetized rats. Diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) completely inhibited bladder contraction, causing the bladder pressure to rise until solution leaked from the penis. The inhibitory effects of diazepam were reversed by picrotoxin (1 mg/kg, i.v., twice with an interval of 10 min), and the effects were potentiated and attenuated by pretreatment with aminooxyacetic acid (AA, 10 mg/kg, i.v.) and semicarbazide (200 mg/kg, i.v.), respectively. Only pretreatment with AA inhibited the bladder contraction induced by infusion of Tyrode's solution into the bladder in six out of eight rats. Diazepam abolished efferent discharges recorded from the left pelvic nerve, but hexamethonium facilitated the generation of efferent discharges after inhibition of bladder contraction. After complete inhibition of bladder contraction by diazepam, electrical stimulation of the left pelvic nerve at 5 Hz for 30 sec was able to induce bladder contraction, and this resulted in micturition. Intracerebroventricular injection or intrathecal injection into the sacral part of the spinal cord of 1 microgram muscimol completely inhibited the bladder contraction. It was considered that the inhibitory effects of GABA receptor agonists on bladder contraction were mainly induced through the GABA receptors in the micturition center of the sacral cord, as well as the brain stem.", 
    "28": "The effect of acute renal disease on the serum free fraction of phenytoin, diazepam and propranolol was examined in vitro among 37 patients with acute renal insufficiency of varying etiology and 10 healthy control subjects, men and women equally. The free fractions were separated at 37 degrees C using a pressure ultrafiltration method. The free fraction of phenytoin varied from about 14% to 45% and that of diazepam from 2% to 10%. The free fraction did not correlate significantly with either the serum urea or creatinine concentrations or the creatinine clearance within the acutely uremic group. The free fractions of propranolol varied considerably in the uremic patients but did not correlate significantly with the above parameters either. The mean free fractions of propranolol in the acutely uremics (11.9 +/- 1.0%, mean +/- SE) and controls (8.9 +/- 0.5%) did not differ significantly. The free fractions of both phenytoin and diazepam had a significant inverse correlation with the serum albumin level and that of propranolol with the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha, AGP) level. The correlations were similar irrespective of the etiology of renal failure. In practice, the variable best predicting the phenytoin and diazepam free fractions in acute renal insufficiency is the serum albumin concentration, and for propranolol the serum alpha 1-AGP concentration.",

    "30": "Drug findings in 137 drug positive cases of Driving Under the Influence of Drugs (DUID) occurring in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A. from June 1983 through May 1986 are presented. Thirty-two different drugs were detected. A single agent was detected in only 34% (47/137) of cases. The most frequently encountered drugs, expressed as percent of positive cases, were: phencyclidine, 47%; marijuana, 47%; benzodiazepines, 22%; barbiturates, 15%; opiates, 11%; and cocaine, 9%. Most multiple drug cases involved popular illicit drug mixtures, such as cocaine and morphine (speedballs) or phencyclidine on marijuana (whack). All the drivers in this survey had displayed inappropriate or impaired operation of a motor vehicle to the extent that a law enforcement officer had stopped and charged them for DUID. In at least 81% of the drug positive cases, persons impaired in the operation of a motor vehicle from a drug or drugs other than alcohol, were impaired not as the result of side effects of therapeutic drug use, but as the result of deliberate self intoxication with illicit or controlled substances.", 
    "31": "Fourteen patients with high- (n = 7) and low-dose (n = 7) benzodiazepine (BDZ) dependency presented predominantly with anxious and depressive neurotic symptoms which caused long-term BDZ medication. Their BDZ dependency was characterized by giving preference to the abuse of benzodiazepines with long elimination half-life. Significant enlargement of CSF spaces was only found in high-dose dependent patients. Withdrawal after long-term BDZ medication revealed no differences between high- and low-dose BDZ dependency with respect to onset of withdrawal reaction and the correlation between onset of withdrawal and peak fall of BDZ serum level. The peak of withdrawal was reached 3-4 days later in high-dose BDZ dependent patients compared with those with a low-dose dependency. The peak withdrawal in high-dose dependent patients appeared when the serum BDZ metabolite nordiazepam dropped significantly. No such concomitant appearance of peak withdrawal and drop of serum nordiazepam level could be found in low-dose dependent patients. Specificity and intensity of BDZ withdrawal symptoms were the same for those dependent upon high doses of BDZs and those dependent upon low doses, but a protracted withdrawal was only observed in low-dose BDZ-dependent patients. During the withdrawal period psychopathometric measurements consistently revealed parallel changes in the scores for physical withdrawal symptoms, anxiety and depression. It is not clear whether anxiety and depression are \"typical\" BDZ withdrawal reactions or represent a \"reactivated\" state of the psychopathological disturbance which lead to the BDZ dependency. Possible implications for the therapeutical management of BDZ-dependent patients are discussed.", 
    "32": "Benzodiazepines are known to induce a profound anterograde amnesia in man. In this report, it is shown that methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, has the opposite effect; it enhances performance in learning and memory tasks. Three different learning models were used: habituation to a new environment and passive avoidance in mice and imprinting in chicks. The opposite effects of both beta-CCM and the benzodiazepine diazepam were blocked by administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, providing evidence that the benzodiazepine receptor is involved in these effects.", 
    "33": "Experiments with benzodiazepine receptor ligands in two paradigms involving cognitive processing were performed in order to test whether the concept of bidirectional effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands could also be applied to cognitive functions. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists like chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, ZK 93423 and ZK 91296 induced amnesia in a passive avoidance paradigm. Mice treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, ZK 93426, reached a learning criterion after fewer foot-shocks than saline treated mice both in naive animals and in scopolamine pre-treated animals. Furthermore, ZK 93246, attenuated the amnesic effect of corneal electroshock. The inverse agonists FG 7142 and DMCM decreased the detrimental effect of scopolamine on retrieval. In a signal detection paradigm, chlordiazepoxide impaired signal detection. In aged rats ZK 93426, ZK 90886 and FG 7142 had no effect on signal detection but ZK 93426 and FG 7142 attenuated the impairment of signal detection induced by scopolamine. These effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands may reflect changes in arousal/vigilance, suggesting that BZ inverse agonists may have useful properties in enhancing vigilance.", 
    "34": "The quantitative 2-[14C]deoxyglucose autoradiographic method was used to study the effects of the acute administration of a sedative anticonvulsant dose of diazepam (2 mg/kg) on rat brain energy metabolism. This benzodiazepine was injected to rats chronically treated for two weeks either by caffeine (10 mg/kg/day) or by saline. After the administration of diazepam to saline-treated rats, average glucose utilization of the brain as a whole was reduced by 21% and rates of glucose utilization were deeply decreased in frontal and auditory cortex, mammillary body, lateral thalamus, medial and lateral geniculate. In caffeine-treated rats, the administration of diazepam induced the same effects of brain energy metabolism as in saline-treated rats. The results of the present study indicate that diazepam mainly decreases glucose utilization in structures widely believed to mediate anxiety.", 
    "35": "RO 15-4513, an imidazodiazepine that has been reported to reverse some of the behavioral effects of ethanol, was given to DBA/2 mice. Although no animals treated with a 6 mg/kg dose of this drug had seizures, 20% of animals given 20 mg/kg of this drug had tonic seizures. Ethanol withdrawal was induced in DBA/2 mice treated with 4-methyl pyrazole using an inhalation paradigm. Mice were more likely to have a seizure during ethanol withdrawal if treated with RO 15-4513 (6 mg/kg) than if they received the vehicle. These data suggest administering RO 15-4513 as an alcohol antagonist to alcoholic subjects may increase the incidence of seizures.", 
    "36": "The antiepileptic effect of progesterone, 5-alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione, 3-alpha-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnane-20-one, and 3-alpha-hydroxy-5-beta-pregnane-20-one were tested in an experimental animal model, and compared with the effect of clonazepam. The steroids were dissolved in serum from ovariectomized cats. Ovariectomized adult cats were used and spontaneous epileptic discharges were generated by placing small pieces of penicillin-soaked filter papers on the ipsi and contralateral cerebral cortex. The frequency and amplitude of the interictal epileptiform spikes were recorded, and analysed in a computer. The changes in frequency and amplitudes were calculated. The drugs were infused during 20-s periods into one cerebral hemisphere via the ipsilateral lingual artery with speeds of 1.1, 3.4 and 6.3 ml min-1. A penicillin focus on the contralateral hemisphere served as a simultaneous control. Progesterone and clonazepam showed similar inhibitory effects on epileptiform interictal spiking (median reduction of spike frequency 21%, cf. Table I). The 5-alpha-pregnane-3, 20-dione was generally less potent than progesterone (median reduction 9%) and the 5-alpha- and 5-beta-pregnanolones were two to three times more potent than progesterone (54-66% reduction). The latency of the inhibitory effect was 4-10 s measured from the entrance of the infusion into the lingual artery. The depression lasted 10-20 min. It is concluded that the pregnanolones have strong antiepileptic properties. The rapid onset of effect indicates that the steroids may interact with the neuronal function at the membrane or synaptic levels.", 
    "37": "A simple, specific, and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed for the routine monitoring in serum of the benzodiazepine anticonvulsant, clonazepam. Serum spiked with internal standard, methylclonazepam, was vortex-mixed for 1 min with chloroform at an alkaline pH. The evaporated extract was dissolved in the HPLC mobile phase consisting of sodium phosphate buffer, acetonitrile, and methanol. Analytics were resolved at ambient temperature on a 5-micron Supelcosil LC-PCN column (150 X 4.6 mm) equipped with a guard column. Flow rate was 2.0 ml/min, and monitoring was at 306 nm. The calibration curve was linear from 2 to 200 ng/ml. This method provides selectivity and sensitivity with a precision of 3.5%, average recovery of 99%, and no interference from 42 commonly administered drugs.", 
    "38": "Dose responses were evaluated for the effects of diazepam alone or together with the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist CR 1409 on pentetrazole-induced convulsions, motor performance and spontaneous motor activity. The results obtained showed that the cholecytokinin antagonist potentiated the effects of diazepam on motor performance and the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam, while it did not affect spontaneous motor activity. The data presented are consistent with a role for cholecystokinin in some effects of diazepam.", 
    "39": "Male rats were treated with 5 and 10 mg/kg diazepam once daily for 5-30 days. After the drug discontinuation a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist CGS 8216 (2.5-10 mg/kg) induced a behavioural syndrome that might be characterized as an abstinence syndrome. The most typical signs of abstinence were head twitches, myoclonic seizures of forepaws, emotional hyperirritability, increased muscle tone of the tail, sniffing and chewing. These behavioural changes could be observed within 1-1.5 hours after CGS 8216 injection. The abstinence syndrome was induced by repeated CGS 8216 injections for 10-15 days after diazepam discontinuation. Further analysis has shown that that the intensity of abstinence was dependent on the dose and duration of chronic diazepam, as well as on CGS 8216 dose. It is suggested that CGS 8216-induced abstinence syndrome in rats chronically treated with diazepam might be used as a tool for studying the addictive potential of benzodiazepines.", 
    "40": "An aqueous solution containing 1 mg of adinazolam mesylate per ml was administered orally as a single dose (40 mg) and with loading doses followed by hourly doses such that final dose rates of 1, 2, and 3 mg h-1 were administered to steady-state. Four subjects exhibited linear steady-state kinetics, while the other four exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, based on measurement by HPLC of both unchanged drug and the major N-demethyl metabolite. The drug is very rapidly absorbed and has an intrinsic clearance of total (bound + free) drug which averaged 2.14 l min-1 based on the steady-state data and 1.17 l min-1 based on the single dose data, but these means do not differ significantly. The apparent metabolite clearance, CLmc/fm (where fm = fraction of adinazolam converted to the N-demethyl metabolite), averaged 0.170 l min-1 based on steady-state data and 0.179 l min-1 based on single dose data and these means do not differ significantly. Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as these clearances, had large intersubject variations. Three types of bioavailabilities were estimated from the data.", 
    "41": "Self-administration behavior was maintained by a unit dose of 0.03 mg/kg diazepam in 4 of 5 monkeys trained to respond on a lever by successive approximation using diazepam or saline. A dose-response function was determined using diazepam doses ranging between 0.01 and 0.3 mg/kg/infusion. Peak rates of responding occurred at doses of 0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg/infusion and drug intake was directly related to dose. When saline was substituted for diazepam either before or again after the dose-response function was determined, levels of responding remained unexpectedly high, even after as many as 16 consecutive sessions. The rates of responding maintained under extinction conditions appeared to be directly related to the amount of diazepam previously self-administered. For instance, monkeys which did not initially have high rates of responding for saline showed increases in responding after additional exposure to diazepam. Furthermore, the one monkey with low diazepam self-administration rates also had low rates of responding for saline. However, following a period of cocaine self-administration, responding declined in all monkeys when saline was substituted for cocaine. The data suggest that diazepam self-administration affects responding under extinction conditions, an effect which makes the interpretation of diazepam's reinforcing properties difficult.", 
    "42": "Ro 15-4513 (1.5 mg/kg) decreased the exploratory activity of mice in a holeboard test. This effect was reversed by diazepam (1 mg/kg), ethanol (1 g/kg) and sodium pentobarbital (15 mg/kg). Higher doses of these three agents reduced the number of exploratory head-dips, and Ro 15-4513 antagonised these effects. These observations are consistent with the suggestion that Ro 15-4513 is a partial inverse agonist at benzodiazepine receptors and acts by reducing the efficacy of GABA. Ro 15-4513's interaction with ethanol in the holeboard closely resembled its interaction with the barbiturate.", 
    "43": "The thermodynamic properties of pirenzepine (PZ) binding to membrane-bound and digitonin-solubilized muscarinic receptors (mAChR) from the rat forebrain and heart were evaluated. Apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of PZ were measured from saturation studies using [3H]PZ for forebrain membrane-bound mAChR and from inhibition studies of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding using unlabeled PZ, at five different temperatures from 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C. The Kd values of PZ binding to both membrane-bound and solubilized mAChR decreased with decreasing temperature whereas the maximum receptor density was unchanged. The heterogeneity of membrane-bound mAChR characterized by PZ binding to mAChR from both tissues disappeared upon digitonin-solubilization of the mAChR. The magnitude of changes of the Kd values with temperature was greater in the solubilized mAChR, suggesting that some constituents in the membrane constrained the affinity changes. The Gibbs free energy of PZ binding to membrane-bound and solubilized mAChR were both negative. The Gibbs free energy for membrane-bound receptors decreased (more negative) whereas those for solubilized receptors increased (less negative) with increasing temperature. The change in entropy was the apparent major driving force for PZ binding to membrane-bound receptors with the change in enthalpy also being favorable. The change in enthalpy was the apparent major driving force for PZ binding to solubilized receptors at all temperatures with the change in entropy being unfavorable above 17 degrees C in the rat forebrain mAChR and above 10 degrees C in the heart mAChR. Our results suggest an important role for the biomembrane microenvironment and possible topographical differences in the binding sites which may contribute to the mechanism of muscarinic subtypes.", 
    "44": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) were measured, and electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in young (6-month-old) and aged (28-month-old) rats during ventilation with 70% N2O/30% O2 and following fentanyl or midazolam administration. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with radioactive microspheres, and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) was calculated from the arterial-sagittal sinus oxygen content difference and CBF measurements. Fentanyl at the highest dose used (200 micrograms/kg and 400 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) depressed the EEG and decreased CBF 49% and CMRO2 39% in young rats, whereas in old rats, this fentanyl dose decreased CBF 37% and CMRO2 34%, both significantly less than in young rats (P less than 0.05). Midazolam at the highest dose used (5.75 mg/kg) also depressed EEG in both age groups, and decreased CBF 51% and CMRO2 38% in young rats. This depression was significantly less than the 62% decrease in CBF and 59% decrease in CMRO2 produced by midazolam in old rats (P less than 0.05). These results indicate that aging attenuates the cerebrovascular and cerebral metabolic depression produced by fentanyl, but potentiates the same effects produced by midazolam. The enhanced cerebral metabolic depression produced by midazolam in the aged is similar to that seen with phenobarbital, and suggests a similar action of these drugs at the central GABA-benzodiazepine-barbiturate receptor complex.", 
    "45": "The authors describe three patients who each had a catatonic syndrome associated with affective psychosis and who responded dramatically to low doses of lorazepam.", 
    "46": "Two potent and highly selective nonpeptide antagonists, L-365,031 [1-methyl-3-(4-bromobenzoyl)amino-5-phenyl-3H-1,4 benzodiazepin-2-one] and 3H-L-364,718 [1-methyl-3-(2-indoloyl)amino-5-phenyl-3H-1,4 benzodiazepin-2-one] were used to localize \"peripheral\" CCK receptors in rat brain. In autoradiographic experiments, L-365,031 displaced 125I-Bolton Hunter CCK-8 binding from the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) (IC50 = 7 X 10(-8) M), the area postrema (AP), and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) without influencing specific binding to other areas, such as the cerebral cortex or the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. Desulfated CCK preferentially inhibited 125I-CCK binding to cerebral cortex (IC50 = 7 X 10(-8) M) rather than IPN (IC50 greater than 1 X 10(-6) M) or AP-NTS. In the medulla the localization of 3H-L-364,718 binding was similar to L-365,031-sensitive 125I-CCK-8 binding and was found in the AP and medial, but not lateral, aspects of the NTS. In membranes prepared from IPN, NTS, and AP, 3H-364,718 binding was of high affinity (Kd = 0.14 nM), saturable (Bmax = 20 fmol/mg protein), and inhibited by compounds previously shown to act at pancreatic CCK receptors. The receptors labeled by 3H-364,718 were modulated by guanyl nucleotide, which reduced agonist affinity 10-fold without affecting antagonist binding. The localization and high density of CCK receptors in AP and NTS suggest that these receptors may play an important role in processing sensory afferent information.", 
    "47": "When fully amygdala-kindled rats are electrically stimulated in grouped trials with intertrial stimulation intervals of less than 60 min, significant residual inhibition can be demonstrated. When these grouped trials of stimulation are repeated daily, additional cumulative inhibition is seen. The present study examined the effect of daily pretreatment with three doses of pentylenetetrazol (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and two doses of diazepam (0.5 and 2 mg/kg) on daily, grouped trial electrical stimulations of fully amygdala-kindled rats. Little or no reduction was seen in postictal inhibition by pentylenetetrazol pretreatment including the highest dose tested in which prestimulation bursts of spiking were associated with short episodes of forelimb clonus. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the first elicited seizure response each day compared with control trials. Subsequent daily seizure trials of diazepam-treated animals demonstrated a relatively constant degree of dose-dependent seizure suppression without evidence of further postictal inhibition. The neural substrate that governs grouped trial postictal inhibition of amygdala-kindled seizures appears to be resistent to modification by near-convulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol, an agent with a presumed GABA-mediated mechanism of action. Diazepam, an anticonvulsant with a presumed GABA-related or associated mechanism of action, suppressed seizures in a dose-dependent manner nearly equally across all trials.", 
    "48": "Observing a lack of response to orally administered drugs in a patient with Beh\u00e7et's disease, we studied the absorption of amitriptyline, diazepam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and acetaminophen in this patient after single and (or) multiple dose administrations. The relative oral/intramuscular bioavailability of amitriptyline was only 13%, and the steady-state concentrations of this drug on four consecutive days were acutely subtherapeutic (i.e., 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, and 3.7 micrograms/L). The concentrations of diazepam, phenytoin, and acetaminophen in plasma were nonmeasurable. Examination of the gastrointestinal tract by endoscopy and by light and electronic microscopy of a biopsy section revealed inflammatory and vascular changes in the duodenum. In the absence of clinical evidence for malabsorption syndrome, we believe that the decreased drug absorption observed in this patient was caused by inflammatory changes associated with Beh\u00e7et's syndrome.", 
    "49": "The effect of long-acting propranolol hydrochloride (160 mg/d), primidone (250 mg at night), and clonazepam (4 mg/d) on the resting, postural, and kinetic component of tremor was investigated in ten parkinsonian patients in a double-blind crossover design. Tremor was assessed by patient opinion, clinical scoring, and accelerometer recordings. The amplitude and frequency of tremorgrams were determined by spectral analysis. Most patients preferred long-acting propranolol and chose to continue taking the drug. The mean clinical score for resting and postural tremor was significantly decreased by long-acting propranolol but not by primidone or clonazepam. Long-acting propranolol reduced the mean amplitude of resting tremor by 70% and the mean amplitude of postural tremor by 50%. Mean tremor amplitudes were not changed by primidone or clonazepam. Tremor frequency was unaltered by the drugs. No side effects occurred with long-acting propranolol but adverse reactions were common with primidone and clonazepam. Long-acting propranolol is a useful adjuvant therapy for the tremors associated with Parkinson's disease.", 
    "50": "The effects of adding epinephrine to isobaric bupivacaine spinal anesthesia were investigated in 96 ASA class II-III patients aged 75 yr or more scheduled for lower extremity surgery. The subjects were randomly allocated into six groups. All patients received 15 mg bupivacaine plain solution in 4 ml, in the horizontal position. Patients in group 1 received bupivacaine plus 1 ml normal saline; patients in other groups received bupivacaine plus increasing dosages of epinephrine: 0.1 mg (group 2), 0.2 mg (group 3), 0.3 mg (group 4), 0.4 mg (group 5), 0.5 mg (group 6). The segmental level of sensory loss was tested using forceps. The time required for maximal spread of the sensory blockade was significantly 50% greater in group 5 than in group 1. No difference was observed, however, between mean highest levels. Addition of 0.2 mg epinephrine prolonged by a significant 25% regression time to L-2 level. Addition of 0.3 and 0.4 mg epinephrine significantly prolonged two-segment regression time by 36 and 53%, respectively, and regression to L-2 level by 29 and 44%, respectively. Addition of 0.5 mg epinephrine did not result in further prolongation of anesthesia. Motor blockade was also increased by addition of epinephrine. It is concluded that addition of 0.3 mg epinephrine may be useful to increase duration of isobaric bupivacaine spinal anesthesia.", 
    "51": "Nimodipine, a dihydropyridine that interacts with a Ca++ channel-associated binding site, when delivered (30 to 150 micrograms/kg) intra-arterially (ia) to enflurane-anesthetized cats, produced a dose-dependent suppression of seizures evoked by pentylenetetrazol. A comparable suppression was produced by clonazepam (1 to 30 micrograms/kg, ia). Phenytoin was maximally effective only at nearly lethal doses (90 mg/kg, ia). Verapamil, a diphenylalkylamine that interacts with a separate Ca++ channel-associated site, at the maximum nonlethal dose (6 mg/kg, ia) resulted in a mild facilitation of seizure activity. The drug vehicle used in these studies (50% polyethylene glycol-400) had no effect when given alone. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured by the clearance of xenon-133 was markedly elevated immediately after the onset of seizure activity (89 +/- 3 to 168 +/- 4 ml/100 gm/min). Concurrent with their resolution of the seizure activity, both nimodipine and clonazepam reduced rCBF to near preseizure levels and preserved the rCBF response to hypercarbia which would otherwise have been abolished following prolonged seizure activity. Moreover, the effect of nimodipine on rCBF and seizures occurred without any prominent alterations in mean arterial blood pressure as compared to preseizure levels. These data support the proposition that a dihydropyridine Ca++ channel binding site may play a role in modulating paroxysmal neuronal activity, and suggest that this class of agents may reflect a novel group of antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "52": "In this report, we studied drug interaction between oxazepam and imipramine in rats. Oxazepam (20 mg/kg) and imipramine (20 or 50 mg/kg) were administrated orally. The oxazepam concentration in plasma, brain and liver were measured by the method of HPLC. The concomitant use of imipramine induced extension of the elimination half life (T 1/2 beta) and an increase of the area under the concentration time-curve (AUC) on the plasma concentration of oxazepam. With the concomitant use of imipramine, the AUC of oxazepam brain concentration increased approximately 1.42 to 1.56 in contradistinction to oxazepam alone. The anti-pentylenetetrazol effect of oxazepam at 1 hr after administration was increased by the concomitant use of imipramine, but there were no combination effects at 4 hr. The motor incoordination effect of oxazepam and diazepam was measured by the rotarod method. Oxazepam has little effect on the motor incoordination as compared with diazepam. The plasma protein binding of oxazepam was not changed by the combined use of imipramine both in vitro and in vivo. The pharmacodynamic effects of oxazepam were increased by the concomitant use of imipramine, and these effects were in reasonably good agreement with the change in brain concentration of oxazepam.", 
    "53": "Recent studies raise questions regarding use or abuse of alcohol by phobics, and about compatibility of behaviour therapy and benzodiazepine use. In this study 40 patients, referred with mainly anxiety-related problems to a nurse behaviour therapist, and a comparison group of 40 psychiatric nurses completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing use of alcohol, sedative drugs and tobacco, and their perceived anxiolytic effectiveness. The paper confirms earlier findings that the patients, in general, drank less than the general public. They also drank less than the nurses, but used more sedative drugs and were heavier smokers. Alcohol was an unreliable anxiolytic. A few patients, including two agoraphobics, drank heavily and did not enter treatment made conditional on stopping drinking. Implications for case management are discussed.", 
    "54": "The development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of drugs has been demonstrated in animal experiments for most antiepileptic drugs. This evidence is reviewed, including the methodological approach and the differentiation into 'metabolic' and 'functional' tolerance. Clinical evidence of the development to antiepileptic drug effects is equivocal: The existence of tolerance is generally accepted for the benzodiazepines which often lose their antiepileptic effect during prolonged treatment. For this group of drugs tolerance is a major clinical problem. With other antiepileptic drugs some degree of tolerance may develop, but this can hardly be recognized as such under clinical conditions, and is thus not considered to be of major importance for treatment of epilepsy.", 
    "55": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.", 
    "56": "Midazolam is a relatively new benzodiazepine that is widely used in both medicine and dentistry. Its multiplicity of uses makes it unique among the benzodiazepines, and its water solubility and lack of active metabolites give it distinct advantages over diazepam. This paper reviews the clinical pharmacology of midazolam, provides comparison with diazepam and presents current information regarding its indications, limitations, advantages, disadvantages, methods of administration and precautions for use.", 
    "57": "Animal models of anxiety can be classified into three main groups: those based on conflict or conditioned fear; those exploiting the anxiety produced by novelty; those in which anxiety or aversion is chemically induced. This review briefly describes the existing tests and, where available, the results obtained with beta-carbolines. Many of the beta-carbolines are anxiogenic in the tests, however ZK 91296 and ZK 93423 appear to have anxiolytic properties, and ZK 93426 has a similar profile to that of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788. By the results across the spectrum of tests, the reliability and sensitivity of the tests is assessed. The evidence that the anxiogenic and anxiolytic actions of the beta-carbolines are mediated by the BDZ binding sites is also discussed.", 
    "58": "Syndromes due to the abrupt withdrawal of drug treatment occur mainly with adrenal corticosteroids and agents with an action on either the cardiovascular system or central nervous system. The abrupt withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy typically results in symptoms of overactivity in the sympathetic nervous system. Clonidine and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are clinically the most important of these agents, but numerous other drugs have been implicated. Overall, the problem is small when viewed in the context of the huge scale of prescribing of antihypertensive medicines. A more serious problem is the occurrence of crescendo angina following the abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Although other factors may be involved, adaptive up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density is the most likely cause of crescendo angina, and renders the patient more susceptible to sympathetic nervous stimulation following withdrawal of treatment. Besides leading to a recrudescence of the disease being treated, the withdrawal of corticosteroids can cause a variety of syndromes. In particular, problems can arise as a result of treatment-induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Another steroid withdrawal syndrome of unknown aetiology, without significant abnormalities of the HPA axis occurring, has been described. Benign intracranial hypertension may rarely follow steroid withdrawal in children. The syndromes associated with withdrawal of drugs which have an action on the CNS are poorly understood. Withdrawal of neuroleptic drugs can be followed by symptoms that resemble those described following withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs, and those agents with the greatest muscarinic-receptor-blocking properties are those which are most frequently implicated. However, the less common withdrawal dyskinesias are thought to reflect up-regulation of dopaminergic receptors during long term treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms predominate following the abrupt withdrawal of antidepressants but hypomania and an 'akathisia-like' syndrome have been reported. Barbiturates are no longer recommended as hypnotics because of severe effects of withdrawal and the existence of safer alternatives. Short acting barbiturates can be withdrawn by replacement with either phenobarbitone (phenobarbitol) or diazepam and subsequent gradual reduction in dose. The recognition of dependency on benzodiazepines has been slow because of the similarity of mild withdrawal symptoms to the original problem which led to treatment being offered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Fifty patients undergoing endoscopy (laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy) were anaesthetised in a double-blind prospective trial using total intravenous anaesthesia. Half of the patients were anaesthetised with an infusion of a solution of 250 mg ketamine and 12.5 mg midazolam. The other patients received an infusion of a solution of 250 mg ketamine and 20 mg diazepam. In addition, both groups were given increments of 50-100 micrograms of fentanyl. The immediate awakening time (t1) was not significantly different between groups, but the patients who had received midazolam-ketamine, had a significantly shorter time to more complete recovery (t2), a significantly lower frequency of emergence reactions and were more satisfied with the anaesthetic than the patients who had received diazepam-ketamine. There was no difference between groups with respect to intraoperative heart rate and blood pressure. No awareness during anaesthesia was reported.", 
    "60": "Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of bradykinin (BK) analogs containing the substitution DPhe7 produced extreme postural distortions within 2-4 min after injection, eventually causing rats to spin repeatedly around their longitudinal axis. This behavior, called barrel rotation, has been previously reported following ICV administration of several other neuropeptides. Episodes lasted 5-20 min; two deaths occurred at high doses, but no other long-term effects were observed. The quantal ED50 of the prototype compound B4162 (DArg0, Thi5,8 DPhe7BK), was 14.9 nmole; all seven other DPhe7 analogs tested elicited a positive response at 20 nmole. Among analogs not containing DPhe7, only BK elicited any activity (20% response rate), and only at 100 nmoles. Structure-activity considerations indicate that this behavior is not mediated by classical kinin receptors. The response rate to 20 nmole B4162 (81%) did not significantly change after pretreatment with ICV BK (100 nmoles), or IP atropine, haloperidol or phenytoin; whereas pretreatment with ICV captopril and muscimol and IP naloxone, diazepam and phenobarbital all significantly inhibited the response. A GABAergic mechanism may be involved in this peptide behavior.", 
    "61": "The efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety was compared with those of chlordiazepoxide and placebo in a 3-week, double-blind study of 212 patients. After a 1-week, single-blind placebo-washout period, patients were randomized to receive either propranolol (80, 160, or 320 mg/day), chlordiazepoxide (30, 45, or 75 mg/day), or placebo. Patients were evaluated by three physician-rated scales--Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Covi Anxiety Scale (CAS), and Clinical Global Impressions scale--and two patient-rated scales--Symptoms Checklist 90 and Profile of Mood States. Patients in all groups demonstrated significant improvement in their level of anxiety at all time points compared with their baseline level. At Week 1 propranolol and chlordiazepoxide patients were significantly better than placebo patients, as measured by the HAM-A and CAS. At Week 2 only propranolol was superior to placebo, based on HAM-A and CAS scores. Fifteen patients prematurely terminated because of adverse reactions (4 taking propranolol, 4 taking placebo, and 7 taking chlordiazepoxide). The incidence of side effects was similar for the two active drugs; fatigue, drowsiness, and change in libido were significantly more frequent with chlordiazepoxide and drowsiness and indigestion were more frequent with propranolol compared with placebo.", 
    "62": "We tested 187 blood samples to measure Primidone and Phenobarbital plasma levels. 63 were on monotherapy, whereas 124 on polytherapy. We founded a good relationship between PRI dosage and PB plasma levels. However, from our data, we can't find any correlation between PRI dosage and PRI level. Looking at correlations of polytherapy, BDZ and DPA do not change PRI and PB levels, whereas CBZ and DPH increase PB and decrease PRI, probably by inducing the biotransformation of the drug. In conclusion, we suggest the usefulness to measure together PRI and PB levels in order to obtain the best evaluation.", 
    "63": "Eighty women undergoing surgery of at least 2-h duration were randomly allocated to receive either alfentanil or fentanyl to supplement a diazepam nitrous oxide/oxygen anaesthetic. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 0.2 mg and diazepam 10-20 mg and continued with nitrous oxide/oxygen. Analgesia was provided by injection of the narcotic using unlabelled ampoules that contained either alfentanil 0.5 mg ml-1 or fentanyl 0.05 mg ml-1. Apart from a marginally higher heart rate when alfentanil was used, there was no significant difference between groups at any time during the operation. Patients woke 2.7 +/- 3.1 min following discontinuation of nitrous oxide and were extubated after 10.3 +/- 7.6 min (alfentanil) and 17.3 +/- 19.0 min (fentanyl) (P = 0.1). However, following alfentanil significantly more patients could be extubated within 20 min to 30 min after completion of the operation (P less than 0.01). The last top-up dose of alfentanil had to be given nearer the end of the operation than the last dose of fentanyl (P less than 0.01). Patients receiving alfentanil needed significantly more (P less than 0.01) post-operative analgesia."
