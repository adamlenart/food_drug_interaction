    "0": "Hepatic encephalopathy represents a reversible decrease in neurological function caused by liver disease. Overall incidence of seizures in hepatic encephalopathy varies between 2% and 33%. Non-convulsive status epilepticus may be particularly common in these patients. Psychiatric disturbances manifest as agitation, personality change, delusions, etc. Aims of seizure management include treatment of basic disease, correction of precipitant factors, imaging of head, and choice of a pharmacologically safe agent. It is important to consider non-convulsive status epilepticus and rule it out by an EEG. Absolute data for safety profile of drugs in liver disease is still not clear, as changes of pharmacokinetics make choice of drugs difficult. Free drug concentrations may be higher, making plasma concentration monitoring essential in such circumstances. A single seizure may not require therapy. However when started, antiepileptic drugs are usually discontinued early. Drugs with sedative effects are best avoided because of a risk of precipitating coma. Phenytoin and gabapentin are relatively preferred drugs; however, monitoring of drug levels is desirable. Management of agitation includes physical restraint and medication. Benzodiazepines are best avoided. Haloperidol is a safer choice in the presence of liver disease. Overall management of neuropsychiatric state aims at management of underlying pathology, the resolution of which leads to improvement in the clinical symptomatology.", 
    "1": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major neuropsychiatric complication of acute and chronic liver failure. Neuropathologically, HE in chronic liver failure is characterized by astrocytic (rather than neuronal) changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis and in altered expression of key astrocytic proteins. Magnetic resonance imaging in cirrhotic patients reveals bilateral signal hyperintensities in globus pallidus on T1-weighted imaging, which appear to result from manganese deposition. Proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows an increase in glutamine resonance in brain, a finding that confirms previous biochemical studies and is consistent with increased uptake of ammonia by the brain (glutamine synthesis). Recent molecular biological studies show an increased expression of several genes coding for neurotransmitter-related proteins in chronic liver failure. Such genes include those for monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), nitric oxide synthase (nNOS isoform) and the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. Activation of these systems may lead to alterations of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter function and changes in cerebral blood flow in chronic liver failure.", 
    "2": "Recent epidemiologic surveys indicate that anxiety disorders in older adults are more common than previously believed. Despite this, knowledge regarding the clinical characteristics of anxiety disorders in elderly patients is emerging slowly. In addition, detection of anxiety symptoms in elders is complicated by several factors, including a confounding of symptom picture by high medical comorbidity, frequent use of multiple prescribed and over-the-counter medications, difficulty of differentiating anxiety from depression, and a tendency of some older adults to resist psychiatric evaluation. Nonetheless, a comprehensive evaluation that includes a clinical interview, self-report measures, and laboratory results, can improve detection and accurate assessment of anxiety in elderly patients. Empirically validated knowledge regarding appropriate pharmacologic interventions in elderly patients is still sparse, and inferences from data in young and middle-aged populations typically form the basis of clinical practice in elderly patients. SSRIs and SNRIs are considered first-line interventions because of their efficacy and relative tolerability in elderly patients. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy, also has been found to be efficacious for older adults with anxiety disorders. Collaborative care models that address physician, patient, and healthcare service delivery barriers, also hold promise for adequately treating anxiety disorders experienced by older adults.",

Evidence suggests that treatment with the atypical antipsychotic drugs olanzapine or clozapine results in a superior amelioration of the anxious and depressive symptoms that accompany schizophrenia relative to therapy with classical antipsychotics such as haloperidol. Moreover, olanzapine and clozapine, but not haloperidol, increase the brain content of neuroactive steroids. The effects of olanzapine and clozapine on the stress-induced increase in dopamine output in the rat cerebral cortex have now been compared with that of haloperidol.",

    "19": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) derivatized as chiral stationary phase is used to directly separate oxazepam (Oxa) and lorazepam (Lor) enantiomers. The effect of temperature on the direct HPLC separation of Oxa and Lor enantiomers is studied for the commercially available beta-CD derivatized bonded chiral stationary phase. Chromatographic peak coalescence, appearing as a plateau between the resolved peaks, is observed at column temperatures of above 13 degrees C. Peak coalescence on the beta-CD derivatized bonded column is attributable to racemization of the Oxa enantiomer. By reducing the column temperature to 13 degrees C, the enantiomeric composition of Oxa and Lor could be determined on the chiral column. This method is expected to be useful for the resolution of 3-hydroxybenzodiazepines. At the same time, the separation mechanism is studied by calculating the thermodynamic parameters. The results reveal that the separation of Oxa and Lor enantiomer is a case of enthalpy-controlled separation, inclusion mechanism does not control the separation. The interaction between Oxa and beta-CD is an additionally strong pi-pi interaction or hydrogen bonding, but that between Lor or beta-CD derivatized is a weak pi-pi interaction or hydrogen bonding.", 
    "20": "Sleep disturbances are common in critically ill patients and contribute to morbidity. Environmental factors, patient care activities and acute illness are all potential causes of disrupted sleep. Additionally, it is important to consider drug therapy as a contributing factor to this adverse experience, which patients perceive as particularly stressful. Sedative and analgesic combinations used to facilitate mechanical ventilation are among the most sleep disruptive drugs. Cardiovascular, gastric protection, anti-asthma, anti-infective, antidepressant and anticonvulsant drugs have also been reported to cause a variety of sleep disorders. Withdrawal reactions to prescribed and occasionally recreational drugs should also be considered as possible triggers for sleep disruption. Tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed in the treatment of sleep disorders, but have problems with decreasing slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep phases. Newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics offer little practical advantage. Melatonin and atypical antipsychotics require further investigation before their routine use can be recommended.", 
    "21": "People have abused drugs from the moment they found out about them. Abuse of substances increased during crises (war, displacement, catastrophes, different stress-induced circumstances, fear for existence, absence of prospects and hope). Benzodiazepines are most frequently abused psychopharmaceuticals due to their easy accessibility. The war and aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina have made unforeseeable consequences, they have caused great migration of population, deaths, wounding, separation of families, unemployment and social poverty. All these factors have had influence on mental health of people. The most frequent psychological consequence of war and displacement is PTSP. The survey has shown that there is a difference in drugs abuse between the interviewees in collective centres and local population. A great percentage of interviewees who are accommodated in collective centres are traumatised (63%) and they mostly misused benzodiazepines to alleviate fear, nervousness, mood disorder and pain. Due to a long-term and uncontrolled use of benzodiazepamines, 50% of interviewees who abused benzodiazepamines have become addicted to them.",

    "30": "To examine regional differences of synaptic transmission, the effects of midazolam were observed on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1-PCs) and dentate gyrus granule cells (DG-GCs) in rat hippocampal slices. Midazolam is one of the most popular benzodiazepines. The monosynaptic IPSCs in the CA1-PCs and DG-GCs were evoked by electrical stimulation of GABAergic interneurons and recorded by whole cell patch-clamp techniques. The effects of specific concentrations of midazolam (0.3, 1, 10 and 75 microM) on the IPSCs in CA1-PCs and DG-GCs were examined at particular membrane potentials (20 mV steps, from -120 to +40 mV). In all midazolam concentrations tested, the conductance of the IPSCs was significantly larger than that in control and was increased by increasing the concentration of midazolam in CA1-PCs (normalized conductance, 0.3 microM, 121%; 1 microM, 125%; 10 microM, 147%; 75 microM, 147%). However, midazolam did not significantly change the conductance of the IPSCs in DG-GCs (normalized conductance, 0.3 microM, 92%; 1 microM, 92%; 10 microM, 91%; 75 microM, 115%). The normalized conductance was significantly different between the CA1-PCs and DG-GCs in 1 and 10 microM midazolam. The results strongly suggest that the differential effects of midazolam on IPSCs in CA1-PCs and DG-GCs could be, at least in part, due to the different sensitivity to midazolam of the GABA(A) receptor subtypes.",

Chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) and diazepam (DZP) were used as model drugs. Effect of PEG 4000, PEG 10000, and stearic acid on floatability and release profile was studied. Water uptake increased with increase in the loading of polar drug (CPM) and decreased with non-polar drug (DZP). Similar effect was found to occur in case of drug release. PEGs increased the release up to certain concentration and decreased thereafter. Drug release decreased linearly with concentration of stearic acid. The type and extent of mesophases formed were significantly affected by the nature of drug, excipients and their concentration. Thus the selection of suitable excipients depending on polarity of drug, could help to modulate the floatability and release profile from GMO matrices.",

Intra- (n = 7) and inter-day (n = 8) coefficients of variation determined at three concentrations ranged from 1 to 8% for MID, from 2 to 13% for 1OHMID and from 1 to 14% for 4OHMID. The percent theoretical concentrations (accuracy) were within +/-8% for MID and 1OHMID, within +/-9% for 4OHMID at 500 pg/ml and 2 ng/ml, and within +/-28% for 4OHMID at 100 pg/ml. The limits of quantitation were found to be 10 pg/ml for the three compounds.

Loss of responsiveness to an eye deprived of vision can be initiated prematurely by enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated transmission with benzodiazepines. Here, we use a mouse \"knockin\" mutation to alpha subunits that renders individual GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors insensitive to diazepam to show that a particular inhibitory network controls expression of the critical period. Only alpha1-containing circuits were found to drive cortical plasticity, whereas alpha2-enriched connections separately regulated neuronal firing. This dissociation carries implications for models of brain development and the safe design of benzodiazepines for use in infants.",

Here, we examine cortical influences upon developing visual afferents in the cat by altering intrinsic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition with benzodiazepines. Local enhancement by agonist (diazepam) infusion did not perturb visual responsiveness, but did widen column spacing. An inverse agonist (DMCM) produced the opposite effect. Thus, intracortical inhibitory circuits shape the geometry of incoming thalamic arbors, suggesting that cortical columnar architecture depends on neuronal activity.", 
    "46": "Approximately one quarter of patients who present to physicians for treatment of chest pain have panic disorder. Panic disorder frequently goes unrecognized and untreated among patients with chest pain, leading to frequent return visits and substantial morbidity. Panic attacks may lead to chest pain through a variety of mechanisms, both cardiac and noncardiac in nature, and multiple processes may cause chest pain in the same patient. Panic disorder is associated with elevated rates of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and, possibly, sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, patients with panic disorder and chest pain have high rates of functional disability and medical service utilization. Fortunately, panic disorder is treatable; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy all effectively reduce symptoms. Preliminary studies have also found that treatment of patients who have panic disorder and chest pain with benzodiazepines results in reduction of chest pain as well as relief of anxiety.", 
    "47": "BACKGROUND: While past studies suggest that primary care physicians underdiagnose and undertreat depression, little is known about recent national patterns of depression treatment. METHOD: Using the 1995 and 1996 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, we analyzed 1322 primary care office visits by patients reported to have depression. Rates of psychotherapy/mental health counseling, antidepressant use, and benzodiazepine use were assessed. Independent predictors of depression therapy were examined using multiple logistic regression. Where instructive, we compared the practices of primary care physicians with those of psychiatrists (2418 depression visits). RESULTS: Primary care physicians reported depression in 7.8% of their office visits. For these depression visits, antidepressants (42%) were the most common form of treatment, followed by psychotherapy/mental health counseling (28%) and benzodiazepines (21%). Among specific antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were most often prescribed by primary care physicians (26% of depression visits). Rates of antidepressant and benzodiazepine use varied significantly by primary care specialty. In addition, geographic region and health insurance status influenced the likelihood of receiving benzodiazepines. In their depression visits, psychiatrists reported psychotherapy/mental health counseling (88%) most frequently, followed by antidepressants (64%) and benzodiazepines (25%). CONCLUSION: The predominant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors suggests that primary care physicians have begun to adopt new therapeutic strategies for depression. The modest rate of antidepressant therapy for a clinical population specifically identified by primary care physicians as having depression may indicate undertreatment of depression in primary care settings. Furthermore, high rates of benzodiazepine use are inconsistent with treatment guidelines, and variations in treatment patterns suggest that nonclinical factors influence depression management.", 
    "48": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent medical disorder that has significant effects on occupational performance, health, and quality of life. Insomnia places an enormous burden on society through increased visits to physicians, loss of productivity in the workplace, and an increased rate of accidents. An estimated sum of $100 million is spent each year on direct treatment of unresolved insomnia. Physicians need to initiate early effective treatment to prevent development of chronic insomnia and its associated morbidity. Institution of good sleep hygiene practices may be useful in some patients but may not be adequate for resolution of all sleep problems. Behavioral treatments, while effective and durable, are time consuming and not widely utilized in clinical practice. Pharmacotherapy includes benzodiazepine hypnotics, but concerns regarding adverse effects (e.g., residual sedation) prompted the search for safer options. DATA SOURCES: Published and presented studies containing clinical data on zaleplon, a new nonbenzodiazepine sleep medication, were identified via MEDLINE, Current Contents (ISI database), bibliographic reviews, and consultation with sleep specialists. RESULTS: Zaleplon effectively shortens sleep onset time and improves the quality of sleep in patients with insomnia. Whether administered at bedtime or later at night, zaleplon is devoid of residual sedative effects that impair next-day functioning. Follow-up studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of zaleplon showed that decreased time to sleep onset was maintained during therapy lasting up to 52 weeks, without a withdrawal syndrome after discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Insomnia is recurrent and unpredictable in nature. Despite the long-term morbidity of this sleep disorder, research evidence and practice guidelines have not explored long-term use of hypnotics. Many patients could benefit from long-term drug therapy with a sleep medication that is devoid of residual effects and can be taken at bedtime or later as symptoms occur, rather than nightly in anticipation of a sleep problem.", 
    "49": "Sleep disorders can be divided into those producing insomnia, those causing daytime sleepiness, and those disrupting sleep. Transient insomnia is extremely common, afflicting up to 80% of the population. Chronic insomnia affects 15% of the population. Benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat insomnia; however, there may be a withdrawal syndrome with rapid eye movement (REM) rebound. Two newer benzodiazepine-like agents, zolpidem and zaleplon, have fewer side effects, yet good efficacy. Other agents for insomnia include sedating antidepressants and over-the-counter sleep products (sedating antihistamines). Nonpharmacologic behavioral methods may also have therapeutic benefit. An understanding of the electrophysiologic and neurochemical correlates of the stages of sleep is useful in defining and understanding sleep disorders. Excessive daytime sleepiness is often associated with obstructive sleep apnea or depression. Medications, including amphetamines, may be used to induce daytime alertness. Parasomnias include disorders of arousal and of REM sleep. Chronic medical illnesses can become symptomatic during specific sleep stages. Many medications affect sleep stages and can thus cause sleep disorders or exacerbate the effect of chronic illnesses on sleep. Conversely, medications may be used therapeutically for specific sleep disorders. For example, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder may be treated with dopamine agonists. An understanding of the disorders of sleep and the effects of medications is required for the appropriate use of medications affecting sleep.", 
    "50": "BACKGROUND: We investigated trends in antidepressant use, as well as broader changes in depression treatment, following the availability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). METHOD: Using data from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, a nationally representative survey of U.S. office-based physicians conducted by IMS HEALTH, we analyzed trends in antidepressant prescribing patterns from 1987 through the third quarter of 2001. Annual sample sizes of physician visits by patients reported to have depression ranged from 3901 visits in 1987 to 6639 in 1998. Outcomes examined included the frequency of depression visits, the likelihood of antidepressant therapy, and the use of specific medications. RESULTS: The estimated national number of physician visits by patients with depression increased from 14.4 million visits in 1987 to 24.5 million in 2001 (annualized). The rate of antidepressant medication treatment in these patients also increased from 70% in 1987 to 89% in 2001. In 1987, tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed to 47% of patients with depression. The most common individual antidepressants were amitriptyline (14%), trazodone (12%), doxepin (8%), and desipramine (6%). In 1989, a year after its introduction, fluoxetine was prescribed to 21% of patients with depression. The introduction of other SSRIs led aggregate SSRI use to grow to 38% in 1992, 60% in 1996, and 69% in 2000. In 2001, sertraline (18%), paroxetine (16%), fluoxetine (14%), citalopram (13%), and bupropion (9%) were the leading antidepressants, while tricyclics were used in only 2% of patients. The use of benzodiazepines in depression declined from 21% of patients in 1987 to 8% in 2001. CONCLUSION: The increasing therapeutic dominance of SSRIs may have contributed to other changes in depression treatment, including declining benzodiazepine use, increased aggregate antidepressant treatment rates, and increased reporting of depression.", 
    "51": "Anxiety disorders are widely prevalent but insufficiently recognized and inadequately treated in primary care practice. The annual costs of morbidity and mortality of these disorders approach $50 billion, substantially more than costs for schizophrenia or all affective disorders combined. Somatization of anxiety contributes to the challenges of making an accurate diagnosis and to the indirect costs associated with delaying appropriate treatment. Pharmacologic interventions give clinicians the necessary tools to treat anxiety safely and effectively. Former therapeutic choices were limited to benzodiazepines, buspirone, and older antidepressants, but newer anxiolytic agents have become available. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and agents with dual reuptake inhibition, such as venlafaxine XR, are optimizing therapy and yielding less risk for serious adverse events, greater safety in long-term therapy, and opportunity for improved patient compliance. These newer antidepressants provide substantial efficacy in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression, commonly seen in the primary care setting.", 
    "52": "[(11)C]Flumazenil, a highly selective benzodiazepine antagonist is the most extensively used GABA(A) ligand for PET so far. To overcome half life disadvantages of (11)C a [(18)F]-labeled flumazenil derivative, 2'-[(18)F]fluoroflumazenil (FFMZ) was developed and biologically evaluated with respect to the GABA(A) receptor. Organ with the highest uptake was the pituitary gland. Brain uptake was high and followed the order cortex>thalamus>cerebellum>rest brain. Fluoroflumazenil displaced [(3)H]flumazenil binding from membrane GABA(A) receptors with an IC(50)value (3.5 nM) comparable to that of Flumazenil (2.8 nM). The presented data confirm the potential of [(18)F]FFMZ for PET imaging of the GABA-ergic system.", 
    "53": "To test the hypothesis that benzodiazepine receptor density decreases in response to stress, we correlated (125)I-iomazenil ((125)I-IMZ) binding with serum corticosterone levels in a rat model. Wistar male rats were divided into four groups; control group (CON, 10 rats), no physical or psychological stress; and one-, three-, and five-day stress groups of 12 rats each (1-DAY, 3-DAY, and 5-DAY, respectively), receiving psychological stress for the given number of days. Psychological stress were given to rats with a communication box. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of (125)I-iomazenil of the 3-DAY and 5-DAY showed that (125)I-iomazenil-benzodiazepine receptor binding was significantly reduced in the cortices, accumbens nuclei, amygdala and caudate putamen (p<0.05). Serum corticosterone level ratio appeared to be slightly elevated in 3-DAY and 5-DAY, although this elevation was not significant. These data suggest that (125)I-IMZ is a useful radioligand to reflect received stress and its binding in the cortices, accumbens nuclei, amygdala and caudate putamen is strongly affected by psychological stress.",

    "59": "A fatality due to ingestion of a reversible inhibitor of monoamine-oxidase A (MAO-A) is reported. Moclobemide is generally considered as a safe drug far less toxic than tricyclic anti-depressants. However, severe intoxications may result from interactions with other drugs and food such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-Parkinsonians of the MAOI-type (e.g. selegiline) or tyramine from ripe cheese or other sources. In the present case, high levels of moclobemide were measured in peripheral blood exceeding toxic values reported so far in the scientific literature. The body fluid concentrations of moclobemide were of 498 mg/l in peripheral whole blood, 96.3 mg/l in urine while an amount of approximately 33 g could be recovered from gastric contents. The other xenobiotics were considered of little toxicological relevance. The victim (male, 48-year-old) had a past history of depression and committed one suicide attempt 2 years before death. Autopsy revealed no evidence of significant natural disease or injury. It was concluded that the manner of death was suicide and that the unique cause of death was massive ingestion of moclobemide.",

The effect of the conventional antipsychotics haloperidol and zuclopenthixol, and the atypical agents clozapine and olanzapine in the concentration of 10(-6) M was investigated on basal and glucose-stimulated insulin release. Both clozapine and olanzapine increased basal insulin release, whereas zuclopenthixol inhibited glucose-stimulated release and haloperidol had no significant effect. In summary, clozapine and olanzapine, in contrast to conventional antipsychotics, increase basal insulin release. Interestingly, this stimulatory effect on insulin release in vitro may be supported by recent clinical findings, showing elevated insulin levels in patients being treated with clozapine or olanzapine.",

    "63": "Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome (SHA) is a rare (1/1.000 to 1/10.000 in new exposures) but potentially life-threatening syndrome that occurs after exposure to an anticonvulsant, most commonly the aromatic ones such as phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. Clinical features of this syndrome include cutaneous reactions, fever, lymphadenopaties, eosinophilia and internal organ involvement (mainly liver, but also kidney, CNS, heart or lung). We present a case report of a 61-year-old woman treated with phenobarbital who developed a cutaneous eruption attributed to this drug. Treatment was changed to phenytoin and after 17 days the patient developed cutaneous rash, eosinophilia and an increase in transaminase levels. The high rate of cross-sensitivity between aromatic anticonvulsants (40-80%) suggests a link between a hypersensitivity reaction to phenytoin and the previous reaction to phenobarbital.", 
    "64": "Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly common in elderly patients, who present a particular anaesthetic challenge. The majority of people over the age of 70 years have some degree of cerebral atrophy. The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is due to alterations in the transport, degradation and aggregation of proteins. Alterations in physiology that occur with advancing age affect both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs used in the elderly. Changes in pharmacokinetics result in either increased or reduced drug concentrations depending on the variable contributions of absorption, metabolism and elimination. The distribution of a drug depends on its protein binding, cardiac output and blood volume, which are all altered in the elderly. Metabolism and excretion of drugs are also affected due to changes in hepatic and renal mass and blood flow in the elderly. A number of drugs are used in neurodegenerative disorders including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and levodopa. Polypharmacy is a common problem, which can lead to adverse drug interactions and an exacerbation of dementia. Levodopa, bromocriptine and tricyclic antidepressants are known to cause orthostatic hypotension in patients with neurodegenerative disease. Elderly patients are liable to excessive sedation from benzodiazepines in both the pre- and postoperative period; therefore these drugs should be prescribed in low doses. For induction of general anaesthesia propofol is a suitable agent in patients with neurodegenerative disease due to its rapid metabolism, but may not be suitable in patients with Parkinson's disease as it can induce spontaneous involuntary movements. Volatile inhalational agents should be administered carefully in the elderly, as they are more sensitive to the depressant cerebral and cardiovascular effects. Levodopa should be avoided in conjunction with halothane, which sensitises the heart to catecholamines. Co-administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and opioids should be avoided as it can cause agitation, muscular rigidity, sweating and hyperpyrexia. If an anticholinergic agent is required, then glycopyrronium bromide is the drug of choice in this group of patients, as it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Patients should continue to take their usual medications in hospital and do not let the change in routine alter the times at which treatments are administered. This is particularly relevant to the timing of levodopa in Parkinson's disease, as missed treatment can be detrimental. Regional anaesthesia may, however, have significant advantages in patients with Parkinson's disease, who can continue to take oral levodopa preoperatively, during surgery, if required, and early in the postoperative period. Anti-emetic drugs such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones and metoclopramide should be used carefully in the postoperative period in these patients as their antidopaminergic effects may induce or exacerbate parkinsonian effects.",

Conscious sedation is a viable tool for both dentist and patient to overcome anxiety without having to turn to general anesthesia. This article reviews the current use of oral sedatives in dentistry, taking into account their availability and pointing out advantages and disadvantages in daily practice. Rapid onset and short half-life benzodiazepines can be considered the gold standard, always taking into account possible adverse effects.

As a last resort we have general anaesthesia. Indications and procedures are outlined.", 
    "67": "We experienced anesthetic management for a patient with platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome. This syndrome is relatively uncommon and accompanies dyspnea and hypoxemia on changing to a sitting or standing from recumbent position. A 75-year-old man with the syndrome underwent atrial septal defect closure on cardiopulmonary bypass. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with midazolam, propofol, fentanyl and vecuronium bromide. During the induction, Spo2 decreased suddenly from 100% to 70%, Spo2, however, recovered to 97% immediately after changing to Trendelenburg position. The perioperative and postoperative course was uneventful, except for hypoxemia during induction. Although the exact mechanisms of platypneaorthodeoxia remains to be solved, right-to-left shunt by an anatomical abnormality and by change of the atrial septum is considered one of the hypoxic mechanisms. We suggest that it is necessary to prevent right-to-left shunt and hypoxemia in anesthetic management of a patient with platypneaorthodeoxia syndrome.", 
    "68": "Manic depressive illness is a poorly understood condition whose causes are primary (possibly hereditary) as well as secondary. It is difficult to diagnose and treat and at the present time, lithium and anticonvulsants remain the preferred medications for the acute phase of mania. However, concomitant use of benzodiazepines or neuroleptics may be helpful to facilitate early response to treatment. Management of lithium refractory patients unresponsive to reasonable trials of anticonvulsants may make it necessary for the psychiatrist to use electroconvulsive therapy, generally considered a safe and effective alternative. Evaluation of concurrent illnesses and recognition of side effects in these treatments are also important to optimize results.", 
    "69": "The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the effects of the dopamine agonist amantadine in those patients with weight gain induced by olanzapine. An open trial was conducted in those patients who gained >3 kg in weight induced by olanzapine use. All subjects were evaluated by weight, body mass index (BMI), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) before and after the use of amantadine in addition to olanzapine. Twenty-five of 30 enrolled patients completed the present study. Mean bodyweight and BMI was increased by 6.44 +/- 4.42 kg and 5.04 +/- 3.47 kg/m2 significantly with olanzapine alone (P < 0.001). When amantadine and olanzapine were used together, the average weight and BMI decreased by 1.07 +/- 3.19 kg and 0.84 +/- 2.5 kg/m2, but did not have statistical significance. The average values of BPRS showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001). No significant changes were present in ESRS. Amantadine did not have an effect on weight gain induced by olanzapine.

    "70": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence, distribution of psychiatric diagnoses, and treatment responses of patients with post-partum mental illness at an emergency unit at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Kaohsiung in Taiwan. During a 1 year period a total of 636 Taiwanese women received psychiatric consultation on their visits to the emergency room. Fifteen of these were noted to have post-partum mental illnesses. All subjects were followed up for a minimum of 3-6 months. The prevalence of patients with post-partum mental illness at an emergency unit at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Kaohsiung was 2.4% (15/636). The distribution of psychiatric diagnoses according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn; DSM-IV) criteria included eight cases of major depressive disorders (53.3%), three cases of bipolar I disorder (20%), three cases of schizophrenia (20%), and one case of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition (6.7%). Four subjects manifested catatonic features. Of these four, three had complete remission in catatonic symptoms after receiving intramuscular injection of lorazepam. The fourth subject died of multiple medical diseases. The treatment results suggest that most of the clinical presentations in patients with post-partum mental illness could be relieved by antipsychotics, mood stabilizers or antidepressants. In addition, it was found that intramuscular injection of lorazepam was also effective in patients with catatonic features and post-partum depression or psychosis.", 
    "71": "Benzodiazepines are in wide clinical use for their sedative and tranquilizing actions, the former being mediated via alpha1-containing GABAA receptors. The signal transduction pathways elicited beyond the receptor are only poorly understood. Changes of transcript levels in cerebral cortex induced by acute diazepam administration were therefore compared by microarray analysis between wild-type and point mutated alpha1(H101R) mice, in which the alpha1 GABAA receptor subunit had been rendered insensitive to diazepam. In wild-type animals, diazepam reduced the expression levels of the alpha subunit of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, MAP kinase phosphatase, transcription factor GIF, c-fos and nerve growth factor induced gene-A. None of these transcripts was changed in the alpha1(H101R) mice after treatment with diazepam. Thus, the sedative action of diazepam is correlated with a selective down-regulation of transcripts involved in the regulation of neuronal plasticity and neurotrophic responses. Most transcript changes were transient except for the decrease of the CaMKIIalpha transcript which persisted even 40 h after the single dose of diazepam. This long-term alteration is likely to contribute to the resetting of the neuronal responsiveness, which may be involved in rebound phenomena and, under chronic treatment, in the development of tolerance and dependence.", 
    "72": "GABAA receptors that contain either the alpha4- or alpha6-subunit isoform do not recognize classical 1,4-benzodiazepines (BZDs). However, other classes of BZD site ligands, including beta-carbolines, bind to these diazepam-insensitive receptor subtypes. Some beta-carbolines [e.g. ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)] display a higher affinity for alpha4- compared to alpha6-containing receptors. In order to identify the structural determinants that underlie these affinity differences, we constructed chimeric alpha6/alpha4 subunits and co-expressed these with wild-type rat beta2 and gamma2L subunits in tsA201 cells for radioligand binding analysis. After identification of candidate regions, site-directed mutagenesis was used to narrow the ligand selectivity to a single amino acid residue (alpha6N204/alpha4I203). Substitutions at alpha6N204 did not alter the affinity of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513. A homologous mutation in the diazepam-sensitive alpha1 subunit (S205N) resulted in a 7-8-fold reduction in affinity for the beta-carbolines examined. Although the binding of the classical agonist flunitrazepam was relatively unaffected by this mutation in the alpha1 subunit, the affinity for Ro15-1788 and Ro15-4513 was decreased by approximately 19-fold and approximately 38-fold respectively. The importance of this residue, located in the Loop C region of the extracellular N-terminus of the subunit protein, emphasizes the differential interaction of ligands with the alpha subunit in diazepam-sensitive and -insensitive receptors.", 
    "73": "Melatonin, considered as a main pineal product, may be also synthetized in the gastrointestinal tract from L-tryptophan. Melatonin has been recently shown to affect insulin release and its receptors have been characterized in the pancreas however, the effects of melatonin on the pancreatic enzyme secretion have not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of melatonin or L-tryptophan on amylase secretion in vivo in anaesthetized rats with pancreato-biliary fistulas, and in vitro using isolated pancreatic acini. Melatonin (1, 5 or 25 mg/kg) or L-tryptophan (10, 50 or 250 mg/kg) given to the rats as a intraperitoneal (i.p.) bolus injection produced significant and dose-dependent increases in pancreatic amylase secretion under basal conditions or following stimulation of enzyme secretion by diversion of bile-pancreatic juice. This was accompanied by a dose-dependent rise in melatonin plasma level. Stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion caused by melatonin or L-tryptophan was completely abolished by vagotomy, deactivation of sensory nerves with capsaicin or pretreatment with CCK1 receptor antagonists (tarazepide or L-364,718). Pretreatment with luzindole, an antagonist of melatonin MT(2) receptor failed to affect melatonin- or L-tryptophan-induced amylase secretion. Administration of melatonin (1, 5 or 25 mg/kg i.p.) or L-tryptophan (10, 50 or 250 mg/kg i.p.) to the rats resulted in the dose-dependent increase of cholecystokinin (CCK) plasma immunoreactivity. Enzyme secretion from isolated pancreatic acini was not significantly affected by melatonin or L-tryptophan used at doses of 10(-8) -10(-5) M. We conclude that exogenous melatonin, as well as that produced endogenously from L-tryptophan, stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion in vivo while increasing CCK release. Stimulatory effect of melatonin or L-tryptophan on the exocrine pancreas involves vagal sensory nerves and the CCK release by these substances.",

Research indicates that approximately 50% of psychiatric inpatients receive a PRN medication at some stage of their treatment. Although evidence indicates that traditional antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are equally effective in managing acute agitation and other psychotic symptoms, it has been recommended that benzodiazepines should be the first-line of action because they do not cause the serious side-effects that are common with the traditional antipsychotics. Unfortunately, research indicates that doctors and nurses are not taking advantage of the latest evidence to guide their practice. This paper reviews the limited research available in the area and makes recommendations for evidence-based practice.", 
    "75": "There is a need for greater information about the pharmacologic management of sleep disorders in children. Pharmacologic guidelines must be developed specifically for sleep disorders in children. Ideally, these guidelines should be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for a specific sleep disorder or for the pediatric age range. This approval prevents physicians from being forced to prescribe medications as an \"off label\" indication. Development of easy-to-swallow, chewable, or liquid forms of these medications would be well received by parents everywhere. When these are not available, instructions for compounding these medications into a suspension by pharmacists are needed. Integration of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments may yield better patient outcomes. This approach requires pediatricians to have a comprehensive understanding of clinical sleep disorders in children. Training programs should play the lead role in enhancing pediatricians' knowledge of the pharmacologic treatment of sleep disorders in children.",

Despite improvements in both surgical techniques and (radio) chemotherapy regimens, these tumors remain a great therapeutic challenge. Thus, there is a need for innovative medical treatment strategies effective even in advanced disease. An emerging understanding of the molecular events that characterize carcinogenesis, tumor growth and spread may provide novel targets in cancer therapy. In this review we discuss novel strategies to inhibit growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and spread of tumors and to induce apoptosis. Therapeutic strategies discussed include agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, regulators of apoptosis (NF-kappaB, bcl-2, and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), cyclooxygenase-2, the vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor and matrix metalloproteinases.",

These conditions are frequently encountered in clinical sleep medicine and are among the most important of the \"nonapnea\" sleep disorders. RLS and PD share many features, including derangement of central dopaminergic systems as the putative cause, akathisia, and nocturnal motor fluctuations. In addition, both conditions increase in prevalence with aging, exhibit a beneficial response to dopaminergic therapy, and cause marked sleep disturbances. They frequently overlap, with about 20% of patients with PD having symptoms of RLS. Both conditions appear to have a genetic predisposition that is \"turned on\" by environmental factors. Adverse responses to levodopa occur in both RLS and PD, manifested as rebound and augmentation in RLS and as fluctuations in motor response and dyskinesias in PD. Newer dopaminergic agents are helpful in the management of both conditions.", 
    "83": "High conductance gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) channels (>40 picosiemens (pS)) have been reported in some studies on GABA(A) channels in situ but not in others, whereas recombinant GABA(A) channels do not appear to display conductances above 40 pS. Furthermore, the conductance of some native GABA(A) channels can be increased by diazepam or pentobarbital, which are effects not reported for expressed GABA(A) channels. GABARAP, a protein associated with native GABA(A) channels, has been reported to cause clustering of GABA(A) receptors and changes in channel kinetics. We have recorded single channel currents activated by GABA in L929 cells expressing alpha(1), beta(1), and gamma(2S) subunits of human GABA(A) receptors. Channel conductance was never higher than 40 pS and was not significantly increased by diazepam or pentobarbital, although open probability was increased. In contrast, in cells expressing the same three subunits together with GABARAP, channel conductance could be significantly higher than 40 pS, and channel conductance was increased by diazepam and pentobarbital. GABARAP caused clustering of receptors in L929 cells, and we suggest that there may be interactions between subunits of clustered GABA(A) receptors that make them open co-operatively to give high conductance \"channels.\" Recombinant channels may require the influence of GABARAP and perhaps other intracellular proteins to adopt a fuller repertoire of properties of native channels.",

The sedation regimen, final procedure performed, procedure duration, and complications were recorded. Complication rates between infants <or= 6 months or > 6 months of age and between infants with upper vs lower airway symptoms were compared by chi(2) test with a contingency table.",

Sedation was achieved with ketamine and midazolam (n = 30) or ketamine, midazolam, and fentanyl (n = 29). Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed in 44 patients and bronchoscopy alone in 3 patients. In 11 patients, severe upper airway obstruction and/or anomalies prevented subglottic passage of the bronchoscope. One patient could not be adequately sedated. There were no major complications. Minor complications occurred in 14 patients (23.7%), most commonly mild hypoxemia (n = 9). Brief central apnea developed in three patients. Complication rates were unaffected by age or indication for bronchoscopy.",

    "88": "The defensive responses induced by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG) of the rat have been proposed as a model of panic attacks in humans. In the present study we investigated the acute and chronic effects of fluoxetine and diazepam on freezing and escape reactions elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsolateral (dlPAG) and lateral (lPAG) columns of the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). The frequencies of crossing, rearing, bouts of micturition and fecal boli were also recorded. Electrodes were unilaterally implanted in the brainstem aimed at the PAG. Drug treatments were given daily for 2 weeks with fluoxetine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg ip), a selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, diazepam (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg ip), or saline. Drug effects were assessed acutely (15 min after the first injection) and chronically (15 min after the 14th injection). Chronic, but not acute, administration of fluoxetine caused a significant increase in the threshold of freezing without affecting the escape response elicited by dlPAG/lPAG stimulation. This characteristic pattern of effects could not be attributed to motor deficit, since this drug did not change the number of crossings and rearings. In contrast, no significant threshold changes were observed following acute and chronic treatment with diazepam. These data give further evidence for (a) an antiaversive effect of chronic treatment with fluoxetine, which caused a selective reduction in freezing behavior and neurovegetative responses associated with fearlike reaction elicited by dlPAG/lPAG electrical stimulation; (b) the involvement of the dlPAG and lPAG in the generation and organization of defensive responses and that freezing may probably be associated with panic attacks; and (c) the lack of effect of diazepam in this model is in line with its inefficacy as a panicolytic drug. The study of the unconditioned freezing behavior evoked by dlPAG/lPAG stimulation may constitute a new and interesting model for the study of panic disorder.", 
    "89": "The purpose of this study was to determine how stimuli paired with food alters the effects of pharmacological and dietary manipulations on food intake. Responding of baboons was studied using a schedule of reinforcement that simulated food 'seeking' and food 'taking'. Under one condition, responding during the initial seeking component was reinforced by flashing lights that were paired with food delivery during the latter-taking component. Under another condition, responding during seeking components was reinforced by a 1-s time out that was paired with food delivery during the latter-taking component. Dexfenfluramine (DFEN) decreased responding within seeking and taking components under both conditions. Diazepam (DZP) increased responding within seeking and taking components under both conditions. Amphetamine (AMPH) increased responding within seeking components under the flashing-light condition, but did not alter responding within seeking components under the 1-s time-out condition. AMPH decreased responding within taking components under both conditions. As observed with AMPH, caloric prefeeding also increased responding within seeking components only under the flashing-light condition. As observed with DZP, acute deprivation also increased responding within seeking and taking components under both conditions. The effects of AMPH and caloric prefeeding on food seeking are dependent upon the type of stimuli, paired with primary reinforcement.",

    "91": "The stable conformations of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor bivalent ligands 2 and 3 were determined by low temperature NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis. The linear conformation was important for these dimers to access the binding site and exhibit potent in vitro affinity as illustrated for alpha5 subtype selective ligand 2 (15 nM). Bivalent ligand 3 with the 5 atom linker folded back upon itself both in solution and in the solid state, moreover, it did not bind to Bz receptors.", 
    "92": "Benzodiazepines have historically been the mainstay of treatment for sleeping disorders, yet they have many shortcomings. A new group of sedative hypnotic agents has been developed for this purpose. Similar to the benzodiazepines, zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone have activity at the GABA receptor complex, yet they appear to have more selectivity for certain subunits of the GABA receptor. This produces a clinical profile that is more efficacious with fewer side effects. Zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone are structurally distinct. Due to variation in binding to the GABA receptor subunits, these three compounds show subtle differences in their effect on sleep stages, and as antiepileptics, anxiolytics and amnestics. The duration of action of zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone can be related to their individual pharmacokinetic profile, which subsequently determines the time course of drug effect. Each of these compounds has a unique pharmacokinetic profile with different bioavailability, volume of distribution and elimination half-lives. Zaleplon has a rapid elimination so there are fewer residual side effects after taking a single dose at bedtime. By comparison, zolpidem and zopiclone have a more delayed elimination so there may be a prolonged drug effect. This can result in residual sedation and side effects but may be useful for sustained treatment of insomnia with less waking during the night. There are also differences in potency based on plasma concentrations suggesting that there are differences in binding to the GABA receptor complex. Although zaleplon has a much lower bioavailability (30%), the treatment dose is similar to zolpidem and zopiclone (bioavilaibility of 70%) because of the increased potency of zaleplon. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone are significantly different from benzodiazepines. The new drugs are sufficiently unique from each other to allow customisation of treatment for various types of insomnia. While zaleplon may be best indicated for the delayed onset of sleep, zolpidem and zopiclone may be better indicated for maintaining a complete night's sleep. Only the patient's symptoms and response to treatment will dictate the best course of treatment.", 
    "93": "We studied the sleep of patients with insomnia during continuous and very long-term use of benzodiazepines (BZDs), and after withdrawal. A group of 25 patients (mean age 44.3+/-11.8 years) with persistent insomnia, who had been taking BZDs nightly for 6.8+/-5.4 years was selected. The control group was comprised of 18 age-matched healthy individuals. Sleep stage parameters were analyzed during Night 1 (while taking BZDs), Night 2 (first night after completing BZD withdrawal), and Night 3 (15 days after gradual BZD withdrawal). Sleep data for control subjects was monitored in parallel. Sleep EEGs of the patients were analyzed using Period Amplitude Analysis (PAA), during Nights 1 and 3 only. During BZD use, a significant reduction of Total Sleep Time (TST) and increased sleep latency were found in the insomniac group when compared to controls. We found an increase in stage 2 non-REM (NREM) sleep, and a reduction in Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) when comparing to night 3 (after withdrawal). Sleep EEGs analysis showed an increase in sigma band and decrease in delta count in stages 2, 3, 4 NREM and REM sleep in the BZD group when comparing to night 3 (after withdrawal). During the BZD withdrawal period, six out of nine subjects taking lorazepam failed withdrawal. In the remaining 19 subjects, gradual withdrawal of BZDs was associated with immediate worsening of nocturnal sleep, as indicated by sleep parameters. However, 15 days after withdrawal (Night 3), some of the sleep structure parameters of patients were not significantly different from baseline (while taking BZDs), except for a significant increase in SWS and in delta count throughout most sleep stages, and a decrease in stage 2 NREM sleep. These values were not different from those shown by control subjects. REM sleep parameters showed no significant variation across the experimental conditions. Subjective sleep quality was significantly improved on Night 3 compared with Night 1.", 
    "94": "Chronic intake of BZDs may be associated with poor sleep in this population. A progressive 15-day withdrawal did not avoid an immediate worsening of sleep parameters. But at the end of the protocol, SWS, delta count, and sleep quality were improved compared to those recorded during the chronic BZD intake, despite the lack of change in sleep efficiency.", 
    "95": "Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is a pervasive form of social anxiety that affects approximately 5% of persons in the community. Among evidence-based pharmacologic treatments for the disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become widely used and are known to be efficacious. Monotherapy with the benzodiazepine clonazepam is also efficacious for GSAD, but the adjunctive use of clonazepam with an SSRI to potentially improve outcomes has not been studied to date.",

A 2-week taper of double-blind medication was followed by an additional 8 weeks of open-label paroxetine treatment (during which the dose of paroxetine could be increased to a maximum of 50 mg/day). Twenty-three patients (82%) met DSM-IV criteria for avoidant personality disorder. The patients' mean +/- SD age was 31.2 +/- 7.7 years, and their mean duration of illness was 12.1 +/- 5.8 years. Data were gathered from August 2001 to April 2002.", 
    "97": "Nineteen (68%) of 28 patients completed treatment. At the end of the 10-week double-blind treatment, there was a trend (p <.06) favoring the paroxetine/clonazepam group, who had a 79% response rate (Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement scale [CGI-I] score of 1 or 2) compared with a 43% response rate for the paroxetine/placebo group. However, no significant differences on other outcome measures were noted between the 2 groups in an intent-to-treat analysis, in terms of either very early (2-4 weeks) or not as early (5-10 weeks) responses during treatment. Dropout rates due to adverse events were rare (1 patient in each group), indicating that the paroxetine/clonazepam combination was well tolerated.", 
    "98": "Coadministration of clonazepam with an SSRI, in contrast to findings in panic disorder, did not lead to more rapid resolution of symptoms in GSAD. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the clonazepam-added group had superior global outcomes (e.g., as measured on the CGI-I), although power to detect such differences in this study was small. These observations suggest that a role for adjunctive benzodiazepines in patients with GSAD (e.g., for augmenting SSRI partial response or nonresponse) is deserving of further controlled investigation.", 
    "99": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat maternal depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy. Recent reports suggest that prenatal SSRI exposure is associated with a neonatal discontinuation syndrome. It remains unclear whether these symptoms are directly related to SSRI exposure alone or are due to concurrent pharmacologic factors. Also, this study explores relationships between neonatal outcomes and medication levels during pregnancy, at delivery, and in the newborn period.",

A prospective cohort of mothers and their infants (N = 46) who had received SSRI medication alone or in combination with clonazepam were studied from June 1996 through June 2000 and compared with a nonexposed control group (N = 23). Infants were assessed in the newborn period for signs suggestive of a \"discontinuation syndrome.\" Maternal drug levels were measured during the pregnancy and at delivery. Infant drug levels from cord blood and at day 2 of life were also obtained.",

In group 1, 25% had symptoms (fluoxetine N = 3; paroxetine N = 3; sertraline N = 1) and in group 2, 39% of infants had symptoms (paroxetine with clonazepam, N = 7). Symptoms were typically mild respiratory distress and, less commonly, hypotonia. Symptoms were self limited and not associated with other neonatal conditions. When paroxetine was combined with clonazepam, infants with symptoms had significantly elevated paroxetine levels when compared with similarly exposed infants without symptoms (p <.05). Among single-agent paroxetine-exposed infants, drug levels did not differ significantly between those with and without symptoms. Maternal dose of clonazepam was significantly higher (p <.05) during pregnancy and at delivery among symptomatic infants compared with nonsymptomatic infants. Developmental outcomes at 2 and 8 months of age did not differ between symptomatic and nonsymptomatic infants.", 
    "102": "While transient neonatal symptoms were found in infants after single-agent prenatal exposure to SSRIs and when paroxetine was combined with clonazepam, the addition of clonazepam appeared to alter paroxetine metabolism, leading to increased drug levels and risk for transient neonatal symptoms. These data highlight the importance of accounting for a variety of pharmacologic factors beyond single-agent SSRI exposure that may lead to poor neonatal adaptation. Further studies are needed with a larger sample of infants to determine the role of clonazepam and whether similar outcomes occur when exposure includes other SSRIs in combination with clonazepam.",

Differences were statistically significant over 5 years and in 1999 (p <.0001). Among persons with major depression or other psychiatric disorders, those with comorbid SUD were more likely to use fast-acting/high-potency benzodiazepines; there were no such differences for those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

We adapted the concept of general Calpha atom positioning from the cluster analysis and recombination of each ideal beta-turn conformation pattern by Garland and Dean (J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 1999, 13, 469) as one strategy of designing non-peptide beta-turn scaffolds. Herein, the Calpha positions of tetrahydro-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one scaffold were analyzed after the calculation of the low-energy conformer using a semiempirical protocol. Three points of corresponding Calpha carbons for diverse substitutions in the scaffold were designated, and an efficient solid-phase synthesis of the peptidomimetic library was developed. The scaffold itself was synthesized in solution phase starting from 5-hydroxy-2-nitrobenzaldehyde and loaded to the 4-formyl-3,5-dimethoxyphenoxy (PL-FDMP) resin with high efficiency of reductive amination. Various building blocks for the derivatization of the 7-hydroxyl and N-1 amide nitrogen could be introduced via selective alkylation. Cleavage, parallel column chromatography, and NMR analysis of 62 final compounds confirmed the feasibility of this peptidomimetic library synthesis.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the findings of various radiological examinations of the brain in the course of infantile CLN1 in order to evaluate the relative usefulness of the methods and their potential for monitoring therapeutic interventions. We examined eight infantile CLN1 patients, 51 studies, in various stages of the disease--preclinical to late stage--with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), MRI, and perfusion SPECT, and in addition three benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligand SPECT studies. Both 1H-MRS and MRI showed abnormal findings before clinical manifestations of the disease. Cortical hypoperfusion and loss of cortical BZ receptors revealed by SPECT appeared simultaneously with clinical signs. After the age of 4 years MRI and SPECT alterations progressed minimally, whereas 1H-MRS showed progressive deterioration of neurometabolism. Of the four methods used in this study, MRI proved to be the most practicable for diagnosing infantile CLN1; the final diagnosis of infantile CLN1 is confirmed by the characteristic clinical picture and DNA or PPT enzyme analysis. The combination of 1H- MRS and MRI could be most useful for monitoring therapeutic interventions.", 
    "109": "Pretreatment of mice with Ro5-4864 or PK11195 inhibited the first- and second-phase responses in the formalin test and this effect was significantly reversed by aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of pregnenolone synthesis, suggesting that the antinociceptive effect of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands is dependent on steroid formation. Doses of Ro5-4864 that did not produce an antinociceptive effect when injected by the intraperitoneal route presented an analgesic effect, if infected by the intracerebroventricular, intrathecal or intraplantar routes. PK11195 pretreatments with intrathecal, intracerebroventricular or intraplantar doses had no effect in the formalin test. These results suggest that the antinociceptive effect of Ro5-4864 reflects the influence of this ligand on steroid production not only in many nonneuronal peripheral tissues but also in the nervous system, while the antinociceptive action of PK11195 may be due to the stimulation of steroid synthesis only in nonnervous tissues.",

The target daily dose was 15 milligrams for olanzapine, 6 milligrams for risperidone, and up to 30 milligrams per kilogram (minimum, 15 milligrams per kilogram) for divalproex. The hostility item of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was the principal outcome measure. Covariates included the PANSS items reflecting positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, suspiciousness/persecution, grandiosity, unusual thought content, conceptual disorganization, and hallucinatory behavior).",

The Benzodiazepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ), Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), and Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) were administered to 599 outpatients using BZDs. Regression analyses were conducted using BZD dependence diagnoses and severity scales as dependent variables. BZD dependence diagnoses were only predicted by being a self-help patient and long BZD elimination half-life (for only the DSM-III-R). The main predictors of BZD dependence severity, as measured by the ICD-10, DSM-III-R scales, and Bendep-SRQ Rasch scales, were in decreasing order: (1) being a self-help patient; (2) higher BZD dose, longer duration of BZD use, younger age; and (3) non-native cultural origin, lower level of education, being in outpatient treatment for alcohol and/or drug dependence, and the interaction of BZD dose with duration of BZD use. We conclude that a limited number of recognizable risk factors appear to predict the severity of BZD dependence. Additional administration of a specific BZD dependence instrument is recommended to confirm suspected BZD dependence and guide further clinical decision-making.",

Non-familial cases may be idiopathic, or associated with pathology usually in the brainstem or rarely in the supratentorial compartment. The pathophysiological basis of HE is unclear. We report the case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with excessive startle response to unexpected stimuli and falls since the age of 16 years. There was no family history. She was initially diagnosed with epilepsy and started on phenytoin with no resolution of her symptoms. Clinical examination revealed hyperreflexia and an insecure broad-based gait but no other abnormalities. Routine comprehensive neuropsychological assessment revealed below average intelligence with signs of frontal lobe dysfunction. EEG showed non-specific abnormalities in the right frontal and central regions. A (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPET scan revealed hypoperfusion in the frontal (worse on the right) and temporal lobes and to a lesser extent in the basal ganglia. MRI was normal, as well as blood and CSF tests. No mutations were found in a genetic analysis of GLRA1. The patient improved partially with treatment by clonazepam. The localisation of the clinical and neuropsychological findings accord with the EEG and SPET scan abnormalities in our patient and corroborates previous reports. Appropriate neuropsychological testing and functional imaging enable more accurate delineation of the clinical phenotype of this rare disorder.",

Opioid antagonists such as naloxone may have a role in reversing the intolerance when it is associated with intravenous opioid infusions. A 38-year-old woman hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome was supported with low tidal volume mechanical ventilation. She required lorazepam and morphine administered by continuous intravenous infusion to achieve ventilator synchrony and pain control. While receiving these therapies, the patient developed persistent intolerance to intragastric feeding. Intravenous metoclopramide and laxatives did not decrease gastric volume residuals, and insertion of a jejunal tube was deemed unsafe due to worsening of her respiratory status. Total parenteral nutrition was begun to meet her caloric needs, but she experienced repeated catheter-related bloodstream infections. Naloxone 2 mg by gastric tube every 8 hours for 8 days was started; the dosage then was increased to 4 mg every 8 hours. Tube feeding was restarted, which provided the patient with more than 90% of her daily caloric needs and allowed for discontinuation of parenteral nutrition. With this dosage of naloxone, tolerance to intragastric feeding was maintained until the patient's death due to refractory respiratory failure. Enterally administered naloxone is an effective, noninvasive means of reversing intolerance to intragastric feeding associated with opioids.",

Many questions about use of antipsychotics in older patients remain unanswered by available clinical literature. We therefore surveyed expert opinion on antipsychotic use in older patients (65 years of age or older) for recommendations concerning indications for antipsychotics, choice of antipsychotics for different conditions (e.g., delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, psychotic mood disorders) and for patients with comorbid conditions or history of side effects, dosing strategies, duration of treatment, and medication combinations.",

However, antipsychotics were favored in several other disorders. For agitated dementia with delusions, the experts' first-line recommendation is an antipsychotic drug alone; they would also consider adding a mood stabilizer. Risperidone (0.5-2.0 mg/day) was first line followed by quetiapine (50-150 mg/day) and olanzapine (5.0-7.5 mg/day) as high second-line options. There was no first-line recommendation for agitated dementia without delusions; an antipsychotic alone was high second line (rated first line by 60% of the experts). The experts'first-line recommendation for late-life schizophrenia was risperidone (1.25-3.5 mg/day). Quetiapine (100-300 mg/day), olanzapine (7.5-15 mg/day), and aripiprazole (15-30 mg/day) were high second line. For older patients with delusional disorder, an antipsychotic was the only treatment recommended. For agitated nonpsychotic major depression in an older patient, the experts' first-line recommendation was an antidepressant alone (77% first line); second-line options were an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine, and an antidepressant plus a mood stabilizer. For nonpsychotic major depression with severe anxiety, the experts recommended an antidepressant alone (79% first line) and would also consider adding a benzodiazepine or mood stabilizer to the antidepressant. If an older patient with adequate dosages for adequate duration, there was limited support for adding an atypical antipsychotic to the antidepressant (36% first line after two failed antidepressant trials). Treatment of choice for geriatric psychotic major depression was an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant (98% first line), with ECT another first-line option (71% first line). For mild geriatric nonpsychotic mania, the first-line recommendation is a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (57%; first line) or a mood stabilizer alone (48%; first line) and would discontinue any antidepressant the patient is receiving. For psychotic mania, treatment of choice is a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (98%; first line). Risperidone (1.25-3.0 mg/day) and olanzapine (5-15 mg/day) were first-line options in combination with a mood stabilizer for mania with psychosis, with quetiapine (50-250 mg/day) high second line. If a patient has responded well, the experts recommended the following duration of treatment before attempting to taper and discontinue the antipsychotic: delirium, 1 week; agitated dementia, taper within 3-6 months to determine the lowest effective maintenance dose; schizophrenia, indefinite treatment at the lowest effective dose; delusional disorder, 6 months-indefinitely at the lowest effective dose; psychotic major depression, 6 months; and mania with psychosis, 3 months. For patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity, the experts would avoid clozapine, olanzapine, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency). Quetiapine is first line for a patient with Parkinson's disease. Clozapine, ziprasidone, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency) should be avoided in patients with QTc prolongation or congestive heart failure. For patients with cognitive impairment, constipation, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, dyslipidemia, xerophthalmia, and xerostomia, the experts prefer risperidone, with quetiapine high second line. More than a quarter of the experts considered these combinations contraindicated: clozapine + carbamazepine, ziprasidone + tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and a low-potency conventional antipsychotic + fluoxetine. In combining antidepressants and antipsychotics, the experts would be much more cautious with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are more potent inhibitors of the CYP 450 enzymes (i.e., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) and with nefazodone, TCAs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The experts recommended extra monitoring when combining any antipsychotic with lithium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or valproate (except aripiprazole, risperidone, or a high-potency conventional plus valproate) or with codeine, phenytoin, or tramadol.", 
    "137": "The experts reached a high level of consensus on many of the key treatment questions. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide direction for common clinical dilemmas in the use of antipsychotics in elderly patients. Clinicians should keep in mind that no guidelines can address the complexities of an individual patient and that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used in applying these recommendations.", 
    "138": "Lormetazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic which is beneficial in shortening the time to onset of sleep. The aim of the study was to assess a new formulation of lormetazepam (oral solution) in comparison with lormetazepam tablets in out-patients with insomnia. This trial was an open randomized parallel group study conducted by 30 general practitioners. One hundred and eight patients took 0.5 mg on the first night and were allowed to increase their dosage by 0.25 mg (for oral solution) and 0.5 mg (for tablets), respectively, each day and every 2 days. The patients assessed the efficacy, acceptability and tolerance of lormetazepam using a diary card and a set of visual analogue scales assessing their sleep. Over 14 days of treatment, the mean daily dose of lormetazepam was lower in the oral solution group than in the tablets group (0.78 mg versus 0.97 mg). The cumulated dose of lormetazepam was lower with the oral solution (18% reduction). No significant difference between the two groups was found in the assessment of sleep characteristics. The occurrence of side effects did not differ between the two groups. These results suggest that a unitary dose as achieved by an oral solution of lormetazepam allows easier determination of the minimal individual effective dose.", 
    "139": "Conscious sedation using monitored anesthesia care can provide a clinical spectrum from relaxation to moderate anesthesia. This middle ground between general anesthesia and \"pure\" tumescent liposuction can help facilitate patient comfort and surgical proficiency during the procedure.", 
    "140": "To describe a method of liposuction surgery with monitored anesthesia care in which a designated licensed and qualified individual is responsible for administration of supplemental intravenous conscious sedation as well as continuous monitoring of the patient.", 
    "141": "Conscious sedation is induced with midazolam, and the patient is titrated to level II-V on the Ramsey sedation scale with propofol. The basic surgical technique is that of tumescent liposuction. However, the supplemental conscious sedation allows the tumescent fluid to be infiltrated at higher rates and fat extraction to be completed in a shorter period with minimal or no discomfort.", 
    "142": "In the authors' experience with more than 5,000 cases of liposuction surgery using this method, safety and efficacy have been proved. No patients have experienced significant adverse effects.", 
    "143": "Tumescent liposuction surgery with monitored anesthesia care provides a middle ground between general anesthesia and purely tumescent liposuction.", 
    "144": "That 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha/beta-pregnane steroids (GABA steroids) have modulatory effects on the GABA-A receptor is well known. In behavioral studies in animals high exogenous dosages give concentrations not usually reached in the brain under physiological conditions. Animal and human studies show that GABA-A receptor-positive modulators like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, and allopregnanolone have a bimodal effect. In pharmacological concentrations they are CNS depressants, anesthetic, antiepileptic, and anxiolytic. In low dosages and concentrations, reached endogenously, they can induce adverse emotional reactions in up to 20% of individuals. GABA steroids can also induce tolerance to themselves and similar substances, and rebound occurs at withdrawal. Menstrual cycle-linked disorders can be understood by the concept that they are caused by the action of endogenously produced GABA-steroids through three mechanisms: (a) direct action, (b) tolerance induction, and (c) withdrawal effect. Examples of symptoms and disorders caused by the direct action of GABA steroids are sedation, memory and learning disturbance, clumsiness, increased appetite, worsening of petit mal epilepsy, negative mood as tension, irritability and depression during hormone treatments, and the premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A continuous exposure to GABA steroids causes tolerance, and women with PMDD are less sensitive to GABA-A modulators. A malfunctioning GABA-A receptor system is related to stress sensitivity, concentration difficulties, loss of impulse control, irritability, anxiety, and depression. An example of withdrawal effect is \"catamenial epilepsy,\" when seizures increase during menstruation after the withdrawal of GABA steroids. Similar phenomena occur at stress since the adrenals produce GABA steroids during stress.", 
    "145": "Based on lower rates of acute extrapyramidal side effects associated with second-generation antipsychotics, compared to first-generation antipsychotics, and based on preliminary data, second-generation antipsychotics are expected to cause less tardive dyskinesia than first-generation antipsychotics. This hypothesis was examined in a systematic review of studies involving open or controlled treatment with any second-generation antipsychotic.", 
    "146": "Studies of treatment with second-generation antipsychotics lasting > or =1 year and reporting on new cases of tardive dyskinesia or dyskinesia were systematically reviewed.", 
    "147": "In 11 studies, 2,769 patients received treatment with risperidone (five studies, N=1,235), olanzapine (two studies, N=610), quetiapine (two studies, N=386), amisulpride (one study, N=331), or ziprasidone (one study, N=207) for a weighted mean and median duration of 263 and 306 days, respectively. Study designs were double blind and randomized (N=3); open-label extensions of double-blind, randomized trials (N=4); and open label (N=4). Of the four trials that had a comparator (all involving adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorders), three used haloperidol (N=408) and one used placebo (N=71). Studied populations included children (N=77), adults (N=1,419), adults and elderly persons (N=794), and exclusively patients age 54 years or older (N=479). The weighted mean annual incidence of tardive dyskinesia for second-generation antipsychotics was 0% in the children, 0.8% (range=0.0%-1.5%) in the adults, 6.8% in the mixed adult and elderly population, and 5.3% (range=0.0%-13.4%) in the patients age 54 years and older, compared to 5.4% (range=4.1%-7.4%) in adults treated with haloperidol.", 
    "148": "Results from 11 long-term studies support the idea that second-generation antipsychotics have a reduced risk for tardive dyskinesia, compared to first-generation antipsychotics, although the doses of haloperidol used in the comparator studies were relatively high. More carefully designed studies, ideally lasting beyond 1 year and comparing the effects of different second-generation antipsychotics in patients who have never taken first-generation antipsychotics, are needed to estimate the true risk. It would not appear premature for clinicians to consider these findings in making long-term treatment decisions.", 
    "149": "A 31-year-old woman failed to awaken after an uneventful general anesthesia (propofol, alfentanil and 65% N2O in oxygen) for laparoscopic resection of an ovarian cyst. After the operation she was extubated and vital signs were stable. However, the patient remained unresponsive even to painful stimuli for about 2 h. Just before we performed a computed tomogram of the brain to exclude a cerebral lesion we noticed that she blinked. We hypothesized that unconsciousness was due to a dissociative stupor. After administration of sublingual lorazepam the patient woke up promptly and was alert and normal for the rest of the hospital stay. In conclusion, after exclusion of a pharmacological or organic cause for postoperative unconsciousness, dissociative stupor may be a reason for apparent coma after general anesthesia.", 
    "150": "A rapid, sensitive and specific method to quantify bromazepam in human plasma using diazepam as the internal standard (IS) is described. The analyte and the IS were extracted from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction using diethyl ether-hexane (80 : 20, v/v). The extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Chromatography was performed isocratically on a Genesis C(18) analytical column (100 x 2.1 mm i.d., film thickness 4 microm). The method had a chromatographic run time of 5.0 min and a linear calibration curve over the range 5.0-150 ng ml(-1) (r(2) > 0.9952). The limit of quantification was 5 ng ml(-1). This HPLC/MS/MS procedure was used to assess the bioequivalence of two bromazepam 6 mg tablet formulations (bromazepam from Medley SA Ind\u00fastria Farmac\u00eautica as the test formulation and Lexotan from Produtos Roche Qu\u00edmico e Farmac\u00eautico SA as the reference formulation). A single 6 mg dose of each formulation was administered to 24 healthy volunteers (12 males and 12 females). The study was conducted using an open, randomized, two-period crossover design with a 3 week washout interval. Since the 90% CI for C(max), AUC(last), AUC(0-240 h) (linear) and AUC((0- infinity )) ratios were all inside the 80-125% interval proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration, it was concluded that the bromazepam formulation from Medley is bioequivalent to the Lexotan formulation for both the rate and the extent of absorption.", 
    "151": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is involved in the generation of various brain rhythmic activities that can be modulated by benzodiazepines. Here, we assessed the contribution of alpha(2)GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors to the effects of benzodiazepines on sleep and waking oscillatory patterns by combining pharmacological and genetic tools. The effects of diazepam on the electroencephalogram were compared between alpha(2)(H101R) knock-in mice in which the alpha(2)GABA(A) receptor was rendered diazepam-insensitive, and their wild-type controls. The suppression of delta activity typically induced by diazepam in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly stronger in wild-type control mice than in alpha(2)(H101R) mice. Moreover, electroencephalogram frequency activity above 16-18 Hz was enhanced in wild-type mice both in non-REM sleep and waking. This effect was absent in alpha(2)(H101R) mice. Theta activity was enhanced after diazepam both in REM sleep and in waking in wild-type mice. In alpha(2)(H101R) mice, this effect was markedly reduced in REM sleep whereas it persisted in waking. These findings suggest that alpha(2)GABA(A) receptors, which are expressed in hypothalamic and pontine nuclei and in the hippocampus, are localized in distinct neural circuits relevant for the modulation of rhythmic brain activities by benzodiazepines.", 
    "152": "The striatum is known to play a primary role in procedural learning. In this study, the authors simultaneously assessed the effects of two antipsychotic drugs on procedural learning and on striatal dopamine (D2) receptor occupancy. Twenty-seven patients receiving either olanzapine or haloperidol as antipsychotic medication were assessed with the Computed Visual Tracking Task (CVTT) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) following the administration of Iodine 123-IBZM (123I-IBZM), a radioligand with a high affinity and specificity for the D2 receptors. The results showed poorer procedural learning in the haloperidol-treated patients than in normal control subjects, while no difference could be found between olanzapine-treated patients and normal control subjects. In the haloperidol but not the olanzapine group, significant correlations were found between procedural learning deficits and striatal D2 receptor occupancy. However, there was no significant difference in D2 receptor occupancy between olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated patients, and this may be related to the high doses of olanzapine and low doses of haloperidol administered. The authors concluded that: 1) striatal D2 receptor blockade may alter procedural learning in humans; and 2) olanzapine may have a protective effect on procedural learning, even at doses that produce striatal D2 receptor occupancy as high as that found with haloperidol. This protective effect of olanzapine may be related to its atypical pharmacological properties.", 
    "153": "The purpose of this study was to verify the accuracy and reproducibility of a multiwell counter to assess its suitability for use within human PET studies in which metabolizing (11)C tracers are used. Such tracers often require metabolite analysis for deriving plasma metabolite-corrected input curves. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line activity measurement is often unreliable for later plasma samples due to the poor sensitivity of the on-line activity detector. Fraction collector obtained HPLC samples that are counted in a separate high-sensitivity well counter can be an alternative to overcome poor counting statistics.", 
    "154": "Several experiments to evaluate background counting, reproducibility, and linearity were performed to validate the accuracy, precision, and detection limits of the well counter. In addition, measurements on a series of samples resembling activity profiles as seen within human (11)C-flumazenil studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the well counter for clinically relevant data.", 
    "155": "The tests proved that the well counter detection limit, linearity, and reproducibility were more than sufficient in circumstances as seen during patient studies for samples with both high and low activity.", 
    "156": "The use of a multiwell counter is a good alternative for the on-line activity detector of the HPLC, allowing derivation of plasma metabolite fractions with high accuracy and reproducibility."
