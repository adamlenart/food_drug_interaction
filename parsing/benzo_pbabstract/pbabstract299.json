We examined the potential involvement of central glutamate, acetylcholine, and CGRP receptors in vagal pathways arising from gut chemo- and mechanosensitive afferents. Unitary recordings were made from 21 vagal preganglionic efferent neurones. Neuronal discharge showed either excitation or inhibition in response to oesophageal balloon distension (1-2 ml), gastric distension (40-60 ml in whole stomach or 20 ml in proximal stomach), cholecystokinin-8s (100 pmol close intra-arterially) and bradykinin (18 nmol close intra-arterially). Effects of glutamatergic non-NMDA, muscarinic M1, and CGRP1 receptor antagonism on efferent responses were investigated using CNQX (75-155 nmol i.c.v.), pirenzepine (2.5-5.0 micromol/kg i.v.), and hCGRP8-37 (3.2-6.4 nmol i.c.v.), respectively. CNQX, pirenzepine, and hCGRP8-37, respectively, altered efferent responses in 65%, 23% and 41% of neurones. When both CNQX and hCGRP8-37 were administered, a further 58% of responses were reduced. CNQX and hCGRP8-37 reduced a proportion of efferent responses to all stimuli whereas pirenzepine selectively reduced only efferent responses to gastric distension. We conclude that central CGRP1 and non-NMDA receptors are involved in mediating a range of upper gastrointestinal mechano- and chemo-sensitive afferent inputs onto vagal efferents. M1 receptors, on the other hand, are selectively involved in neurotransmission from gastric mechanoreceptors.", 
    "1": "The study aimed to investigate the influence of conditioned fear, produced in the passive avoidance test, on neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) and the effect of anxiolytics on NPY-LI in frightened rats. Rats avoided the dark chamber, where they were previously subjected to electric footshock, and they exhibited increased numbers of defecations and gastric ulcers. Moreover, they showed increased NPY-LI in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus, and decreased NPY-LI in the frontal cortex. Diazepam (1 or 3 mg/kg) and buspirone (1.5 or 5 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited passive avoidance and decreased the numbers of defecations, and they also decreased the number of gastric ulcers. Diazepam reversed while buspirone only attenuated the fear-induced changes in NPY-LI in all regions studied. In the amygdala, the effect of diazepam was dose-dependent. The effect of diazepam on both behaviour and NPY-LI was antagonized by flumazenil (15 mg/kg). Apart from supporting the role of the NPY system in fear and anxiety, the results of this study suggest that NPY is involved in the anxiolytic effects of diazepam and buspirone and that the effect of diazepam is mediated by benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepine tranquilizers are used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. To identify the molecular and neuronal target mediating the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines, we generated and analyzed two mouse lines in which the alpha2 or alpha3 GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors, respectively, were rendered insensitive to diazepam by a knock-in point mutation. The anxiolytic action of diazepam was absent in mice with the alpha2(H101R) point mutation but present in mice with the alpha3(H126R) point mutation. These findings indicate that the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepine drugs is mediated by alpha2 GABAA receptors, which are largely expressed in the limbic system, but not by alpha3 GABAA receptors, which predominate in the reticular activating system.", 
    "3": "A clinical study on 46 patients, who were operated on for ophthalmologic diseases under local anaesthesia, is presented. Midazolam, diazepam and/or pethidine, given to the patients 5-10 minutes before the operation improved the classical local anaesthesia; they ensured hypnosis, analgesia, anterograde amnesia and vegetative protection, thus offering a high surgical comfort and diminishing considerably the rate of the well known incidences and complications of the local anaesthesia.", 
    "4": "To determine whether lorazepam is more effective than dimenhydrinate in relieving the symptom of vertigo in the emergency department setting.", 
    "5": "A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous lorazepam versus dimenhydrinate therapy was conducted in the ED of a county-owned, university-affiliated hospital. All adult patients who presented between January 24, 1998, and May 23, 1999, with the symptom of vertigo were eligible for inclusion. The intervention was varying the intravenous treatment between lorazepam, 2 mg, and dimenhydrinate, 50 mg. All patients received intravenous infusion of Ringer's lactate solution at a rate of 100 mL/h. Adequacy of randomization to the 2 treatment groups was assessed by comparing the patients' relevant baseline history, physical examination, and symptoms. The predetermined primary outcome measurement was the patient's sensation of \"vertigo with ambulation\" 1 and 2 hours after treatment. Secondary outcome measurements included vertigo while lying, sitting, and turning the head, ability to ambulate as judged by the enrolling physician, and sensation of nausea and drowsiness 1 and 2 hours after treatment, and whether the patient was \"ready to go home\" per patient report or physician assessment 2 hours after treatment. All patient symptoms were reported on 10-point scales. Outcome measurements were compared between the 2 treatment groups with a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U, and chi(2) test as appropriate.", 
    "6": "Ten patients refused entry into the study, 16 were excluded, and 74 were enrolled, treated, and included in the analysis. One enrolled patient had evidence of vertigo of central origin. The pretreatment values of vertigo with ambulation were strongly correlated with the patient's ability to ambulate (P <.001), suggesting good internal validity. The patients randomly assigned to the lorazepam group were sicker based on their pretreatment symptoms and ability to ambulate, and this may have biased the study results. The patients' symptom of \"vertigo with ambulation\" decreased 1.5 units more (95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 3.0) on average on a 10-point scale 2 hours after treatment in the dimenhydrinate group. All other measures of vertigo also decreased more in the dimenhydrinate group, although the differences were not statistically significant. At 2 hours after treatment, the patients' ability to ambulate was better in the dimenhydrinate group (P <.001), and 17% (95% CI -2 to 36) more patients in this group were \"ready to go home.\" Patients in the lorazepam group experienced a 1.8-unit (95% CI 0.2 to 3.4) greater increase in drowsiness 2 hours after treatment.", 
    "7": "Our results suggest that dimenhydrinate was more effective in relieving vertigo and less sedating than lorazepam at the intravenous doses administered in this study. Dimenhydrinate appears to be the preferred medicine for patients who present to the ED with vertigo likely to be of peripheral origin.", 
    "8": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants and maintenance factors of depression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Fifty CABG candidates were selected randomly for evaluation before and after surgery. Depressive disorders occurred in 22.0% of the patients preoperatively and 21% postoperatively. Irritability as a symptom was more prevalent in depressed than nondepressed patients preoperatively (P=.04) and postoperatively (P=.006). Although depression was the most prevalent diagnosis in the patients' psychiatric histories and evaluations, benzodiazepines were prescribed more frequently than antidepressants (70% vs 3%). Cardiologists should consider that the irritability in some patients undergoing CABG may obscure the diagnosis of depression. The correct recognition of depression is essential to reduce inappropriate benzodiazepine prescription and to apply appropriate treatment.", 
    "9": "The aim of this study was to determine the part played by the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor in cellular photosensitisation with the protoporphyrin IX precursor, delta-aminolaevulinic acid. Evaluation of the delta-aminolaevulinic acid-concentration dependence and kinetics of fluorescent protoporphyrin IX accumulation in monolayers of rat AR4 2J pancreatoma cells established a basis for assessing pharmacological modulation of the biosynthetic pathways for protoporphyrin IX production and photocytotoxicity. Iron chelation enhanced the accumulation of photo-active protoporphyrin IX whereas 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide (PK11195), dipyridamole, or 7-(dimethylcarbamoloxy)-6-phenylpyrrolo-[2,1-d]benzothiazepi ne (DPB), competitive ligands of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, all diminished protoporphyrin IX accumulation, as did acifluorfen, a mitochondrial protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor. In addition to protoporphyrin IX (Em(max): 630 nm), delta-aminolaevulinic acid-treated cells also generated a fluorophore of Em(max) 580 nm; this compound was identified as Zn-protoporphyrin IX. Mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor ligands increased the formation of the zinc porphyrin whilst decreasing that of protoporphyrin IX. The involvement of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor in the translocation of porphyrins and the formation of Zn-protoporphyrin IX have wide implications for the use of delta-aminolaevulinic acid in photodynamic therapy.", 
    "10": "A series of 5-phenyl-3-ureidobenzodiazepine-2,4-diones was synthesized and evaluated as cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) receptor antagonists. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed the importance of the N-1 substituent for potent and selective CCK-B affinity. Addition of substituents at the urea side chain provided in some cases more potent compounds. Moreover the introduction of bulky substituents such as adamantylmethyl at N-1 and resolution of the racemic ureas resulted in our lead compound GV150013.", 
    "11": "Continuing structure-activity studies were performed on the 2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1-(imidazol-4-ylalkyl)-1,4-benzodiazepine farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitors. These studies demonstrated that a 3(R)-phenylmethyl group, a hydrophilic 7-cyano group, and a 4-sulfonyl group bearing a variety of substituents provide low-nanomolar FT inhibitors with cellular activity at concentrations below 100 nM. Maximal in vivo activity in the mutated K-Ras bearing HCT-116 human colon tumor model was achieved with analogues carrying hydrophobic side chains such as propyl, phenyl, or thienyl attached to the N-4 sulfonyl group. Several such compounds achieved curative efficacy when given orally in this model. On the basis of its excellent preclinical antitumor activity and promising pharmacokinetics, compound 20 (BMS-214662, (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thie nyl sulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine) has been advanced into human clinical trials.", 
    "12": "We describe two cases of palatal myoclonus (PM), one essential and another secondary to a stroke. Case 1: a 64 years old female who developed clicking sounds in both ears after a stroke and three years later on noticed a progressive involuntary movement of the throat associated with rhythmic contractions of the soft palate, muscles of tongue and throat. MRI showed an ischemic area in brainstem. The patient had a partial response to the use of sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneously. Case 2: a 66 years old female who began with ear clicking at left ear that worsed slowly associated with tinnitus and arrhythmic movements of soft palate and an audible click at left ear. Brain MRI was normal; audiometry showed bilateral neurosensory loss. She was prescribed clonazepan 1 mg daily with complete recovery. Primary and secondary palatal myoclonus share the same clinical features but probably have different pathophysiological underlying mechanisms.", 
    "13": "The effects of intermittent intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of cocaine (20 mg/kg) on GABA(A)-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors labeled by t-[(35)S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), and on several types of mRNA subunits were investigated in rat brain by in vitro quantitative receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridization. Phosphor screen imaging with high sensitivity and a wide linear range of response was utilized for imaging analysis. There was a significant decrease in the level of alpha 1, alpha 6, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 subunits mRNA, with no alteration of [(35)S]TBPS binding in any regions in the brain of rats at 1 h following a single injection of cocaine. In chronically treated animals, the mean scores of stereotyped behavior were increased with the number of injections. The level of beta 3 subunit mRNA was decreased in the cortices and caudate putamen, at 24 h after a final injection of chronic administrations for 14 days. In the withdrawal from cocaine, the frontal cortex and hippocampal complexes showed a significant increase in [(35)S]TBPS binding and alpha1 and beta 3 subunit mRNA in the rats 1 week after a cessation of chronic administration of cocaine. These findings suggest that the disruption of GABA(A)-BZD receptor formation is closely involved in the development of cocaine-related behavioral disturbances. Further studies on the physiological functions on GABA(A)-BZD receptor complex will be necessary for an explanation of the precise mechanisms underlying the acute effects, development of hypersensitization, and withdrawal state of cocaine.", 
    "14": "There is still controversy surrounding the use of opioid medication for patients with chronic nonmalignant pain. Schofferman has argued that long-term opioid use leads to a \"downhill spiral\" associated with loss of functional capacity and a corresponding increase in depressed mood. The present study was a retrospective comparison of opioid users vs. non-users to determine whether: (a) users have higher levels of disability, medical visitation, depression, and pain; (b) the behavioral problems associated with opioid use persist after controlling for the influence of other medication; (c) opioid use is in fact a predictor of illness behavior; and (d) higher levels of opioid consumption are associated with higher levels of disability and depression. A consecutive series of 243 patients with nonmalignant pain about to enroll at a tertiary clinic were retrospectively assigned to either an Opioid User (n = 87) or Non-User (n = 156) group. Compared to Non-Users, Opioid Users were more likely to be physically disabled ( P <0.05) and depressed ( P<0.05), as well as more likely to report pain at higher levels (P<0.001) and in more locations ( P<0.05). Despite the appearance of a downhill spiral, we were unable to demonstrate an association between opioid use and any measure of illness behavior after controlling for benzodiazepine use (with the possible exception of domestic disability). Instead, we found that benzodiazepine use was significantly associated with activity level ( P<0.05), medical visitation ( P<0.01), domestic disability ( P<0.01), depression ( P <0.01), and to a lesser degree, disability days (P<0.1). Using somatization as a reference variable, we found that opioid use failed to explain a comparable amount of variance in illness behavior. Finally, there was no evidence that higher levels of opioid use were associated with higher levels of disability or depression.", 
    "15": "We studied the relationship between accuracy in the cognitive process and components of event-related potentials (P300) in 21 young and healthy subjects. Benzodiazepine was used to manipulate the cognitive state of the subjects. We recorded the serial changes in P300, choice reaction time (CRT), and error ratio (ER) before and after oral administration of 0.4 mg of alprazolam. After administration, the coefficient of variation of CRT tended to decrease in nine subjects (group I) and increase in 12 subjects (group II). Prolongation of the P300 latency was observed in all subjects after treatment; however, such change was more predominant in group II than in group I. In group I, there was no error and no significant difference in P300 amplitude before and after administration. In group II, alprazolam significantly reduced P300 amplitude and increased ER. Our results suggest that the accuracy and P300 amplitude were preserved when the central nerve system managed to reduce fluctuations in CRT but P300 amplitude diminished and the error ratio increased following deterioration of these processes.", 
    "16": "Children (ages 3 to 18, N = 55) diagnosed with leukemia were tested for their memories of lumbar punctures (LPs), a repeated and painful part of the cancer treatment protocol. Memory for both event details and the child's emotional responses was assessed one week after the LP. Children of all ages displayed considerable accuracy for event details, and accuracy increased with age. Overall recall accuracy for event details and emotional responses was similar. Recall among children given oral Versed was similar to that among children not given Versed. Finally, higher distress predicted greater exaggerations in negative memory 1 week later (although controlling for age weakened this relationship); moreover, greater exaggerations in negative memory predicted higher distress at a subsequent LP. These results indicate that children's memories play an important role in their experience of distress during repeated stressful events.", 
    "17": "Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) commonly exhibit psychosis and behavioral disturbances that impair patient functioning, create caregiver distress, and lead to institutionalization. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in treating psychosis and/or agitation/aggression in patients with AD.", 
    "18": "A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week study was conducted in 206 elderly US nursing home residents with AD who exhibited psychotic and/or behavioral symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or a fixed dose of 5, 10, or 15 mg/d of olanzapine. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of the Agitation/Aggression, Hallucinations, and Delusions items (Core Total) of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version.", 
    "19": "Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d) produced significant improvement compared with placebo on the Core Total (-7.6 vs -3.7 [P<.001] and -6.1 vs -3. 7 [P =.006], respectively). Core Total improvement with olanzapine, 15 mg/d, was not significantly greater than placebo. The Occupational Disruptiveness score, reflecting the impact of patients' psychosis and behavioral disturbances on the caregiver, was significantly reduced in the 5-mg/d olanzapine group compared with placebo (-2.7 vs -1.5; P =.008). Somnolence was significantly more common among patients receiving olanzapine (25.0%-35.8%), and gait disturbance occurred in those receiving 5 or 15 mg/d (19.6% and 17.0%, respectively). No significant cognitive impairment, increase in extrapyramidal symptoms, or central anticholinergic effects were found at any olanzapine dose relative to placebo.",

    "21": "To perform a systematic investigation of medications associated with adverse sedation events in pediatric patients using critical incident analysis of case reports.", 
    "22": "One hundred eighteen case reports from the adverse drug reporting system of the Food and Drug Administration, the US Pharmacopoeia, and the results of a survey of pediatric specialists were used. Outcome measures were death, permanent neurologic injury, prolonged hospitalization without injury, and no harm. The overall results of the critical incident analysis are reported elsewhere. The current investigation specifically examined the relationship between outcome and medications: individual and classes of drugs, routes of administration, drug combinations and interactions, medication errors and overdoses, patterns of drug use, practitioners, and venues of sedation.", 
    "23": "Ninety-five incidents fulfilled study criteria and all 4 reviewers agreed on causation; 60 resulted in death or permanent neurologic injury. Review of adverse sedation events indicated that there was no relationship between outcome and drug class (opioids; benzodiazepines; barbiturates; sedatives; antihistamines; and local, intravenous, or inhalation anesthetics) or route of administration (oral, rectal, nasal, intramuscular, intravenous, local infiltration, and inhalation). Negative outcomes (death and permanent neurologic injury) were often associated with drug overdose (n = 28). Some drug overdoses were attributable to prescription/transcription errors, although none of 39 overdoses in 34 patients seemed to be a decimal point error. Negative outcomes were also associated with drug combinations and interactions. The use of 3 or more sedating medications compared with 1 or 2 medications was strongly associated with adverse outcomes (18/20 vs 7/70). Nitrous oxide in combination with any other class of sedating medication was frequently associated with adverse outcomes (9/10). Dental specialists had the greatest frequency of negative outcomes associated with the use of 3 or more sedating medications. Adverse events occurred despite drugs being administered within acceptable dosing limits. Negative outcomes were also associated with drugs administered by nonmedically trained personnel and drugs administered at home. Some injuries occurred on the way to a facility after administration of sedatives at home; some took place in automobiles or at home after discharge from medical supervision. Deaths and injuries after discharge from medical supervision were associated with the use of medications with long half-lives (chloral hydrate, pentobarbital, promazine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine).", 
    "24": "Adverse sedation events were frequently associated with drug overdoses and drug interactions, particularly when 3 or more drugs were used. Adverse outcome was associated with all routes of drug administration and all classes of medication, even those (such as chloral hydrate) thought to have minimal effect on respiration. Patients receiving medications with long plasma half-lives may benefit from a prolonged period of postsedation observation. Adverse events occurred when sedative medications were administered outside the safety net of medical supervision. Uniform monitoring and training standards should be instituted regardless of the subspecialty or venue of practice. Standards of care, scope of practice, resource management, and reimbursement for sedation should be based on the depth of sedation achieved (ie, the degree of vigilance and resuscitation skills required) rather than on the drug class, route of drug administration, practitioner, or venue.", 
    "25": "The effect of diazepam on sensory gating was studied in rats by measuring diazepam effects on auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) elicited in a ten-tone paradigm. Trains of 10 repetitive tone-pip stimuli were presented. Rats (n = 8) received 4 mg x kg(-1) diazepam subcutaneously or vehicle, counterbalanced over two sessions. Diazepam decreased the amplitude of the middle-latency P30 component and increased the amplitudes of the late-latency N60 and P67 components. The increase in the late-latency components might be due to a diazepam-induced decrease in arousal. Stimulus repetition decreased the amplitudes of the middle-latency N18 and P30 components in both conditions. This suggests that automated neuronal recovery functions underlying sensory gating remain intact with diazepam. In the vehicle condition, the amplitude of the late-latency P67 decreased with stimulus repetition, but not in the diazepam condition. This suggests a diazepam-induced decrease of behaviourally mediated habituation.", 
    "26": "To better understand antidepressant drug effects on the GABA(A) receptor complex (the GABA(A) receptor, chloride ionophore and benzodiazepine receptor), we investigated how antidepressants influenced power spectrum changes induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a chloride ionophore antagonist, in the rat hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG). In control recording, PTZ (27.5 mg/kg i. p.) increased EEG power at frequencies under 12 Hz up to five times. After rats were pretreated with imipramine, fluoxetine or trazodone for 7 days (10 mg/kg i.p., twice a day), PTZ could not increase EEG power to more than three times the power before injection; this effect was not observed after pretreatment for 3 days. These three antidepressants inhibit serotonin uptake, while two other antidepressants, desipramine and nortriptyline, that inhibit norepinephrine uptake failed to counter the PTZ effect. We concluded that antidepressants with serotonergic effects enhanced the function of the GABA(A) receptor complex.", 
    "27": "This study dealt with the question: What are the effects of different doses of the benzodiazepine-like agent zolpidem and the phenothiazine derivative promethazine on mood in pre-anaesthetic medication? Subjects were 192 female and male patients awaiting elective surgery. Two drugs were administered to the patients in the evening before anaesthesia according to a 3 x 2 factorial randomized double-blind design. The first drug factor was zolpidem (8.03 vs. 16.06 mg) versus placebo. These drugs were combined with the second drug factor, either promethazine (50 mg) or placebo. In summary, the results confirm the hypothesis that zolpidem 8.03 mg can induce paradoxical effects, especially of anxiety, 1 h after application. When the dosage is doubled, no adverse effects are found, but there are no effects different from placebo either. Men could probably be described as a risk population for the adverse effects of zolpidem 8.03 mg. Furthermore, selective deactivating effects of promethazine 50 mg were shown in this study. In addition to these anaesthesiological aspects, this study showed promethazine to be useful as a research tool, suitable as a reference drug to detect deactivating effects. The multidimensional self-report inventory BSKE(EWL) (Befindlichkeitsskalierung durch Kategorien und Eigenschaftsw\u00f6rter) detected the expected drug effects, indicating that this instrument is suitable for further pharmacopsychological research.", 
    "28": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) have been identified in peripheral organs as well as in brain glial cells. PBR differ from central benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) in their lack of coupling to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors and the chloride ion channels. We investigated the effect of 21 days administration, followed by 7 days withdrawal, of fluvoxamine (10 mg/kg), desipramine (10 mg/kg) and lithium carbonate (25 mg/kg) on PBR and CBR binding characteristics in male Sprague-Dawley rats. All three agents significantly increased PBR density in the testes and adrenals. All tested drugs induced a significant decrease in PBR density in the kidney and liver. After withdrawal, PBR density remained decreased in the liver in all three groups and in the kidneys of the desipramine- and lithium-treated animals. In the cerebral cortex, CBR density increased in response to all three agents, whereas PBR density decreased significantly in response to desipramine and lithium carbonate. Chronic treatment with fluvoxamine, desipramine and lithium carbonate is apparently associated with a modulation in PBR expression in the testes, adrenals, kidneys, liver and brain, and in CBR expression in brain. The relevance of these tissue-selective alterations to the antidepressive and/or anxiolytic effects of these agents, or their adverse effects, still needs to be determined.", 
    "29": "The goal of this study was to test the effect of concomitant administration of flumazenil (FL) and morphine (MO) on immediate postoperative analgesia and the MO requirement to control pain in human beings.", 
    "30": "Thirty-six patients undergoing inguinal hernioplasty under lidocaine epidural anesthesia were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized, controlled study. On the first complaint of pain, either MO (2 mg) only or MO (2 mg) plus FL (0.2 mg) was administered. Additional doses of the same medications administered via a patient-controlled analgesia device with a 10-minute lockout period were available thereafter. The study continued for 2 hours after the loading doses of the medications were administered, with an additional 2-hour period of observation.", 
    "31": "Thirty-two patients completed the study. Both groups reached a similar satisfactory equianalgesic state (2 in a 0-10 visual analogue scale). The MO plus FL group consumed 9.5 +/- 1.1 mg of MO versus 14.1 +/- 1.1 mg of MO (p < 0.001) in the MO only group. The MO plus FL patients were subjectively (visual analogue scale) more comfortable and less sedated than the MO patients. \"Fine\" coordination (using an electronic maze) and \"coarse\" coordination (measured by transferring a pen from one hand to another as rapidly as possible with both arms placed inside an 80-cm metal frame) in the MO group were worse than in the MO plus FL group. End-tidal CO2 increased and blood pressure decreased in the MO group. There were few and insignificant side effects in the MO group. None of these patients required an MO antagonist, and recovery was prolonged in none.",

    "33": "Sixty patients were anesthesized for MRI. Intravenous and/or intramuscular anesthesia with ketamine, diazepam, pipolphen (promethazine) was supplemented by aminazine (chlorpromazine) or tisercin for adult patients. Spontaneous respiration was maintained, which helped avoid problems with endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. The method is safe, economic, and its side effects are negligible. Main features of MRI and specific anesthesiological problems associated with this method are discussed.", 
    "34": "The study was carried out in 22 patients operated on for vertebral disk hernias and spinal tumors at lumbosacral level. The patients were divided in 2 groups depending on the type of anesthesia (epidural or neuroleptanalgesia-EA and NLA). In the test group all patients were operated under EA with local anesthetics combined with intravenous sedative drugs (diprivan + relanium) under conditions of spontaneous respiration and O2 inhalation through a mask. In the control group combined total intravenous anesthesia by myorelaxants and tracheal intubation were carried out (relanium + diprivan: induction dose 1.95 +/- 0.5 mg/kg, maintenance dose 5.3 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/h, and phentanyl). The purpose of the study was to compare the efficiency of anesthesiological protection under EA and traditional NLA in interventions on the spine, when surgical injury is inflicted in the immediate vicinity to the central structures responsible for pain impulsation. Only EA ensured adequate protection of the patients from surgical stress, as was seen from hemodynamic (arterial pressure and heart rate) and endocrine metabolic parameters (glucose, epinephrine, norepinephrine, hydrocortisone, and prolactin levels). Hence, EA fully demonstrated its protective properties during operations on the spine, and therefore can be regarded as a method of choice in this patient population.", 
    "35": "We evaluated safety and efficacy of a sedation technique based on rectal and intravenous S-(+)-ketamine and midazolam to achieve immobilization during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Thirty-four paediatric patients were randomly assigned to undergo either the sedation protocol (study group) or general anaesthesia (control group). Imaging was successfully completed in all children. Children in the study group received a rectal bolus (0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 5 mg x kg(-1) S-(+)-ketamine) and required additional i.v. supplementation (20+/-10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) S-(+)-ketamine and 4+/-2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) midazolam), spontaneous ventilation was maintained. Transient desaturation occurred once during sedation and four times in the control group (P=0.34). PECO2 was 5.3+/-0.5 kPa (40+/-4 mm Hg) in the study group and 4.1+/-0.6 kPa (31+/-5 mm Hg) in the control group (P<0.001). Induction and discharge times were shorter in the study group (P<0.001), recovery times did not differ significantly between the groups. Our study confirms that a combination of rectal and supplemental intravenous S-(+)-ketamine plus midazolam is a safe and useful alternative to general anaesthesia for MRI in selected paediatric patients.",

    "40": "The mechanisms of conscious perception are uncertain. In a preliminary study, dramatic effects of train duration on perception in a patient with right brain stroke were noted. In this study, the mechanisms of train duration on perception of peripheral somatosensory stimuli are examined. Subjects included healthy adults and patients with right brain infarctions. Train duration effects on perception were examined in relation to cerebral infarction, handedness, age, elevated peripheral threshold via bupivacaine, and impaired attention via diazepam or scopolamine. Perceptual thresholds to electrical pulses on the hand decreased as train duration increased, but only over the first several hundred milliseconds. Compared to controls, right brain stroke patients showed much greater lowering of threshold in the affected hand as train duration was extended. Age and bupivacaine elevated thresholds, but had little or no influence on train duration effects. Diazepam and scopolamine had no effect on thresholds. Thresholds were lower in the left than right hand of healthy dextral subjects, irrespective of age. Sinistral subjects had less left/right asymmetry. Increased train duration effect in patients is not explained by a primary elevation in threshold or by impaired vigilance. Lower perceptual thresholds in the left hand of healthy dextral subjects is consistent with right cerebral dominance for externally directed attention.", 
    "41": "Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine with high affinity at gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors expressing alpha1 subunits. In squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate a high dose of zolpidem (> or =3.0 mg/kg) from saline, zolpidem and another GABA(A)/alpha1 receptor-preferring agonist, zaleplon, substituted dose-dependently for zolpidem, whereas the non-selective agonists diazepam and triazolam were did not substitute at any dose tested. These findings offer the first evidence for a selective role of GABA(A)/alpha1 receptors in the interoceptive effects of high doses of zolpidem.", 
    "42": "We determined whether flumazenil mimics ischemic preconditioning in chick cardiomyocytes and examined the role of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channels in mediating the effect. Chick ventricular myocytes were perfused with a balanced salt solution in a flow-through chamber. Cell viability was quantified using propidium iodide, and ROS generation was assessed using the reduced form of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH). Cells were exposed to 1 h of simulated ischemia and 3 h of reoxygenation. Preconditioning was initiated with 10 min of ischemia followed by 10 min of reoxygenation. Alternatively, flumazenil was added to the perfusate for 10 min and removed 10 min before the start of ischemia. Flumazenil (1 and 10 microM) and preconditioning reduced cell death [54 +/- 5%, n = 3; 26 +/- 4%, n = 6 (P < 0.05); and 20 +/- 2%, n = 6 (P < 0.05), respectively, vs. 57 +/- 7%, n = 10, in controls] and increased DCFH oxidation (an index of ROS production) [0.35 +/- 0.11, n = 3; 2.64 +/- 0.69, n = 8 (P < 0.05); and 2.46 +/- 0.52, n = 6 (P < 0.05), respectively, vs. 0.26 +/- 0.05, n = 9, in controls]. Protection and increased ROS signals with flumazenil (10 microM) were abolished with the thiol reductant N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (2-MPG, 800 microM), an antioxidant (cell death: 2-MPG + flumazenil, 55 +/- 12%, n = 6; ROS signals: 2-MPG + flumazenil, 0.11 +/- 0.19, n = 6). Treatment with 5-hydroxydecanoate (1 mM), a selective mitochondrial K(ATP) channel antagonist, abolished its protection. These results demonstrate that flumazenil mimics preconditioning to reduce cell death in myocytes. ROS signals with the resultant mitochondrial K(ATP) channel activation are important components of the intracellular signaling pathway of flumazenil.", 
    "43": "Naturally occurring benzodiazepines (BZDs) were first detected in mammalian tissues in 1986. They comprise a variety of 1,4-benzodiazepines corresponding to drugs commercially available for the treatment of anxiety disorders, sleep disturbances and epileptic seizures. Several biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of BZDs are currently being discussed and have led to the proposition of possible precursor molecules. For years, the identification of naturally occurring BZDs in mammalian organisms was mostly confined to post mortem CNS material for sensitivity reasons. While radioimmunoassay and radioreceptor assay techniques have been tentatively applied to quantitations of genuine BZDs from human milk and cerebrospinal fluid, accurate measurements in peripheral blood have only recently become accessible, e. g., by gas chromatography/selected ion monitoring-mass spectrometry (GC/SIM-MS). This review summarizes existing evidence of benzodiazepines' occurrence in nature and discusses implications for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of triazolam was increased by about 40% by a single dose of normal-strength grapefruit juice (P < 0.01) and multiple-dose grapefruit juice (P < 0.01) and by 25% by a single dose of double-strength grapefruit juice (P < 0.05). The elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of triazolam was prolonged by 54% during the multiple-dose grapefruit juice phase (P < 0.001). A significant increase in the pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam was seen during the multiple-dose grapefruit juice phase in the digit symbol substitution test (DSST, P < 0.05), in subjective overall drug effect (P < 0.05) and in subjective drowsiness (P < 0.05).", 
    "47": "Even one glass of grapefruit juice increases plasma triazolam concentrations, but repeated consumption of grapefruit juice produces a significantly greater increase in triazolam concentrations than one glass of juice. The t(1/2) of triazolam is prolonged by repeated consumption of grapefruit juice, probably due to inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4 activity.",

    "56": "Increasing depth of sleep corresponds to an increasing gain in the neuronal feedback loops that generate the low-frequency (slow-wave) electroencephalogram (EEG). We derived the maximum-likelihood estimator of the feedback gain and applied it to quantify sleep depth. The estimator computes the fraction (0%-100%) of the current slow wave which continues in the near-future (0.02 s later) EEG. Therefore, this percentage was dubbed slow-wave microcontinuity (SW%). It is not affected by anatomical parameters such as skull thickness, which can considerably bias the commonly used slow-wave power (SWP). In our study, both of the estimators SW% and SWP were monitored throughout two nights in 22 subjects. Each subject took temazepam (a benzodiazepine) on one of the two nights. Both estimators detected the effects of age, temazepam, and time of night on sleep. Females were found to have twice the SWP of males, but no gender effect on SW% was found. This confirms earlier reports that gender affects SWP but not sleep depth. Subjectively assessed differences in sleep quality between the nights were correlated to differences in SW%, not in SWP. These results demonstrate that slow-wave microcontinuity, being based on a physiological model of sleep, reflects sleep depth more closely than SWP does.", 
    "57": "Altitude induced insomnia is a very common symptom in mountaineering. Conventional hypnotics such as benzodiazepines potentially can be associated with untoward side effects because they can impair ventilatory adaptation to hypoxia at altitude.

    "60": "Spinal motoneurons are more susceptible to AMPA receptor-mediated injury than are other spinal neurons, a property that has been implicated in their selective degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of this study was to determine whether this difference in vulnerability between motoneurons and other spinal neurons can be attributed to a difference in AMPA receptor desensitization and/or to a difference in density of functional AMPA receptors. Spinal motoneurons and dorsal horn neurons were isolated from embryonic rats and cultured on spinal astrocytes. Single-cell RT-PCR quantification of the relative abundance of the flip and flop isoforms of the AMPA receptor subunits, which are known to affect receptor desensitization, did not reveal any difference between the two cell populations. Examination of AMPA receptor desensitization by patch-clamp electrophysiological measurements on nucleated and outside-out patches and in the whole-cell mode also yielded similar results for the two cell groups. However, AMPA receptor current density was two- to threefold higher in motoneurons than in dorsal horn neurons, suggesting a higher density of functional AMPA receptors in motoneuron membranes. Pharmacological reduction of AMPA receptor current density in motoneurons to the level found in dorsal horn neurons eliminated selective motoneuron vulnerability to AMPA receptor activation. These results suggest that the greater AMPA receptor current density of spinal motoneurons may be sufficient to account for their selective vulnerability to AMPA receptor agonists in vitro.", 
    "61": "The restless legs syndrome (RLS) characteristically presents with an irresistible urge to move that is most often accompanied by creeping sensations deep in the limbs. Occasionally the upper limbs can also be affected. RLS symptoms occur at rest and are typically more intense at night and at bedtime. Some patients complain about involuntary leg movements, so-called periodic limb movements (PLM), while at rest or PLM have been observed by the bed partner. Often, patients have to get out of bed several times at night, to relieve themselves of their disagreeable sensations.The prevalence of RLS is estimated to be about 5%. Up to now only three classes of drugs have been systematically evaluated for treatment of RLS: benzodiazepines, opioids and dopaminergic agents.The most consistent results have been obtained with dopaminergic drugs. Several studies have shown that L-dopa given with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor at a 10:4 ratio is effective in treating RLS. Controlled studies using polysomnographic recordings in a double-blind design showed that L-dopa administered at night produces a significant reduction of RLS occurring at bedtime and of PLM, which are often associated with nocturnal arousals. In most cases, L-dopa 100mg, in conjunction with the decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa or benserazide 25mg, suppresses RLS although a rebound of PLM may be observed in the last part of the night. The two major adverse effects frequently seen in patients treated with L-dopa are:Augmentation is one of the limiting factors of L-dopa therapy; thus, alternative treatment options are of major interest. In several open treatment trials performed with pergolide, patients reported a marked improvement of RLS symptoms including sleep problems. Mild symptoms of augmentation under pergolide treatment have been reported from single patients. In another 6-month open label trial, pergolide proved to be effective in patients who developed augmentation under L-dopa by relieving daytime symptoms after switching to pergolide.Most recently, the results of these open label trials have been replicated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter trial. Treatment with a single evening dose of 0.25-0.75mg pergolide resulted in a significant improvement of almost all subjective and objective parameters. Under pergolide, patients rated their RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances much less severe and polysomnographic recordings also revealed a significant improvement of all important sleep parameters. To prevent peripheral side-effects such as nausea or orthostatic hypotension, pergolide should be slowly up-titrated or domperidone should be added. Under these conditions, no major side-effects have been observed in treatment trials with pergolide in dosages up to 1.25mg.Pergolide with a half-life of 12-16h thus appears to be an appropriate drug in the therapy of RLS especially in those patients who developed augmentation under L-dopa therapy. Owing to the remarkable therapeutic effect of pergolide on RLS symptom control, other dopamine agonists are presently being tested for the treatment of RLS.", 
    "62": "According to physical impairments of massive obesity, cardiac, respiratory and gastrointestinal physiology must be considered as much as pharmacokinetic behavior. Anesthetic management of morbidly obese patients has to be carefully planned, in order to minimize the increased risks of aspirative pneumonitis, hemodynamic instability and delay in recovery. The ideal anesthesia should provide a smooth and quick induction, allowing rapid airway control, prominent hemodynamic stability, and rapid emergence from anesthesia. To approach these ideal conditions, a Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) with midazolam, remifentanil, propofol and cisatracurium was designed and analyzed.", 
    "63": "10 consenting morbidly obese patients scheduled for elective Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding participated in the study. TIVA with midazolam, remifentanil, propofol and cisatracurium was used in all cases.

    "66": "The highest concentrations of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) are found in the kidneys and heart. In addition, the PBR has been reported to reflect neuro-inflammatory damage by co-localisation with activated microglia. PK 11195 is a high-affinity ligand for the PBR. The aim of this study was to investigate in humans the biodistribution and dosimetry of [123I]iodoPK 11195, a potential single-photon emission tomography tracer for the PBR. Five healthy volunteers were injected with 112 MBq of [123I]iodo-PK 11195. Sequential whole-body scans were performed up to 72 h post injection. Multiple blood samples were taken, and urine was collected to measure the fraction voided by the renal system. Decay-corrected regions of interest of the whole-body images were analysed, and geometric mean count rates were used to determine organ activity. Organ absorbed doses and effective dose were calculated using the MIRD method. [123I]iodo-PK 11195 was rapidly cleared from the blood, mainly by the hepatobiliary system. Approximately 22% was voided in urine after 48 h. Average organ residence times were 0.74, 0.44 and 0.29 h for the liver, upper large intestine and lower large intestine, respectively. The testes received the highest dose, 109.4 microGy/MBq. All other organs investigated received doses of less than 50 microGy/MBq. The effective dose was 40.3 microSv/MBq. In conclusion, [123I]iodo-PK 11195 is a suitable agent for the visualisation of the PBR and indirectly for the imaging of neuro-inflammatory lesions. Taking into account the radiation burden of 7.46 mSv following an administration of 185 MBq, a [123I]iodo-PK 11195 investigation has to be considered an ICRP risk category IIb investigation.", 
    "67": "Practice guidelines call for the careful titration of sedatives and analgesics during endoscopy, with time taken between incremental doses to assess effect.

    "71": "The inhibitory effects of Angelica dahurica root extract on rat liver microsomal cytochrome P450 and drug-drug interactions were studied. The 2alpha- and 16alpha-hydroxylase activity of testosterone were most strongly inhibited, with 17.2% and 28-5% of their activity remaining, respectively, after oral administration of A. dahurica extract at a 1 g kg(-1) dose. 6beta-Hydroxylase activity was also inhibited, with 70% of its activity remaining, under the same conditions. In addition, treatment with the extract inhibited the metabolism of tolbutamide, nifedipine and bufuralol. These results showed that the extract inhibited the various isoforms of cytochrome P450 such as CYP2C, CYP3A and CYP2D1. The A. dahurica extract delayed elimination of tolbutamide after intravenous administration at a 10 mg kg(-1) dose to rats. Thus, the extract altered the liver intrinsic clearance. It had little effect, however, on the pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam after intravenous administration at 10 mg kg(-1). Since diazepam showed high clearance, it underwent hepatic blood flow rate-limited metabolism. Therefore, the change of intrinsic clearance had little effect on hepatic clearance. However, the Cmax value after oral administration of diazepam with extract treatment was four times that with non-treatment. It was suggested that the first-pass effect was changed markedly by the extract. High-dose (1 g kg(-1)), but not low dose (0.3 g kg(-1)), administration of A. dahurica extract increased significantly the duration of rotarod disruption following intravenous administration of diazepam at 5 mg kg(-1). It was concluded that administration of A. dahurica extract has the potential to interfere with the metabolism, by liver cytochrome P450, of other drugs.",

A 1 mg kg(-1) dose of diazepam, almost equivalent to the minimum dose for the anxiolytic effect, disrupted the traction performance, potentiated hexobarbital-induced sleeping and impaired learning and memory performance. DHH-B, even at a dose of 1 mg kg(-1) (i.e. five times higher than the minimum dose for significant anxiolytic effect) neither developed diazepam-like side effects nor enhanced the side effects of diazepam. Rather, the potentiation by diazepam of hexobarbital-induced sleeping was reduced by 1 mg kg(-1) DHH-B. Furthermore, mice treated with 10 daily administrations of 1 and 5 mg kg(-1) diazepam, but not 0.2-5 mg kg(-1) DHH-B, showed precipitated withdrawal symptoms characterized by hyper-reactivity, tremor and tail-flick reaction when they were challenged with flumazenil (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.). These results suggest that, unlike the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam, DHH-B is less likely to induce motor dysfunction, central depression, amnesia or physical dependence at the effective dose required for the anxiolytic effect.",

It turned out to be selective versus a variety of other neurotransmitter systems. When tested in vivo following intraperitoneal injection, compound 3c was found to decrease neophobia in a novel environment and to exhibit dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus-maze procedure, thus confirming the effects observed following intracerebroventricular infusion of the OFQ peptide in rat.",

Extractions were carried out using CleanScreen DAU SPE cartridges. The drugs were separated on a C18 column using a methanol-water-ammonium hydroxide (60:40: 0.03 v/v) mobile phase. After determination of base peaks using full scan mass spectrometry, the mass spectrometry method was optimized to operate in selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode for the base peak of each analyte. Positive findings were confirmed by LC/MS/MS using the same mobile phase and column. This analytical procedure allows for the detection of low levels of flunitrazepam and metabolites in biofluids.

A highly sensitive NCI-GC-MS method for the simultaneous quantitation of flunitrazepam (LOQ 100 pg/mL) and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (LOQ 10 pg/mL) in urine was developed. All samples were screened for benzodiazepines using optimized micro-plate enzyme immunoassay. The highest concentrations of 7-aminoflunitrazepam (70-518 ng/mL) and flunitrazepam (0.7-2.8 ng/mL) in urine were observed 6 h after drug administration in nine subjects and after 24 h in one subject. In six subjects 7-aminoflunitrazepam was detected up to 14 days after flunitrazepam administration, in one subject up to 21 days and in three subjects up to 28 days. In urine samples collected from six volunteers, flunitrazepam was detected three days after Rohypnol intake, in three subjects 24 h, and in one subject 5 days later.

All patients were premedicated with <0.035 mg/kg midazolam and <1 microg/kg fentanyl and received intraarticular bupivacaine and 15-30 mg of IV ketorolac during the procedure. Recovery times, operating room turnover times, and patient satisfaction were recorded by an observer using an objective scale for recovery assessment and a verbal rating scale for satisfaction. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance and chi(2). Postanesthesia care unit discharge times for the general and epidural groups were similar (general = 104+/-31 min, epidural = 92+/-18 min), whereas the spinal group had a longer recovery time (146+/-52 min) (P = 0.0003). Patient satisfaction was equally good in all three groups (P = 0.34). Room turnover times did not differ among groups (P = 0.16). There were no anesthetic failures or serious adverse events in any group. Pruritus was more frequent in the spinal group (7 of 16 required treatment) than in the general or epidural groups (no pruritus) (P<0.001). We conclude that epidural anesthesia with 2-chloroprocaine provides comparable recovery and discharge times to general anesthesia provided with propofol and nitrous oxide. Spinal anesthesia with procaine and fentanyl is an effective alternative and is associated with a longer discharge time and increased side effects.", 
    "85": "For outpatient knee arthroscopy, anesthesia can be provided adequately with regional or general anesthesia. Epidural and general anesthesia provide equal recovery times and patient satisfaction, whereas spinal anesthesia may prolong recovery and have increased side effects. The choice of anesthesia may depend primarily on the patient's interest in being alert or asleep during the procedure.", 
    "86": "Self-mutilation or dermatitis artefacta is a facet of a much broader spectrum of factitial disease. Three nonpsychotic patients with self-mutilation are presented in this article who were successfully treated with low dose olanzapine when all other modalities of therapy had failed, including trials with numerous antidepressants and antipsychotics.", 
    "87": "The patients were simultaneously evaluated and treated by a dermatologist and a psychiatrist who run the psychodermatology or consultation-liaison clinic based at McMaster University. After dermatologic conditions had been excluded as a cause of the clinical findings, olanzapine was prescribed on a trial basis due to its low risk of parkinsonian side-effects and its antihistaminic properties.", 
    "88": "The excellent clinical response of the patients can be attributed to the low side-effect profile of the drug but also to the anti-impulsive effect which stems not only from antihistaminic properties but also from its antidopamine and serotonin-blocking action.", 
    "89": "Although alcohol dependence in women is an increasing problem, little is known about the effects of alcohol on the female brain. Evidence from a few structural and functional neuroimaging studies suggests that the female brain may be more susceptible than the male brain to the harmful effects of alcohol. However, no in vivo studies of the neuropharmacology of alcohol dependence in women have been carried out. The aim of this preliminary study was to test the hypothesis that alcohol dependence in women is associated with greater reduction in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor levels than in men with an equivalent drinking history.", 
    "90": "We used single photon emission tomography and 123I-iomazenil to label the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor and to compare semiquantified levels in 9 abstinent alcohol-dependent and 13 control women. These groups were further compared with equivalent male groups from a previous study.", 
    "91": "There was a trend toward a reduction in GABA-benzodiazepine receptor levels in alcohol-dependent women, but this did not reach significance. These lower levels were seen primarily in the cerebellum, occipital lobes, and parietal cortex (left > right). This was in marked contrast with the pattern of reduction seen in the previous study of male dependence, where significant reductions were seen primarily in the frontal cortex.", 
    "92": "Due to the semiquantitative analysis performed and the relatively small number of subjects in this study, which resulted in a nonsignificant trend, we can only comment on the differences in the pattern of lower levels of GABA-benzodiazepine receptors seen in alcohol dependence in men and women. Although we are not able to ascertain whether the female brain is more susceptible to the effects of alcohol, it appears that alcohol has a differential effect on the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptors in men and women. Recent animal evidence supports this hypothesis. Future studies should explore whether other neuropharmacological differences exist between men and women in alcohol dependence that could have implications for pharmacotherapy.", 
    "93": "Alcohol preferring (P) and alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) rats have been shown to have differing behavioral and electrophysiological responses to drugs that are positive modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor complex, such as ethanol and benzodiazepines. The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone is also a positive modulator of GABA-A receptors; therefore, we hypothesized that P and NP rats would respond differently to intraperitoneally administered allopregnanolone.", 
    "94": "Male P and NP rats were implanted with screw electrodes that overlay the frontal and parietal cortices and with a depth electrode aimed at the amygdala. Allopregnanolone (0.0-10.0 mg/kg ip) was administered 10 min before recording the EEG.", 
    "95": "Allopregnanolone increased high-frequency power (8-32 Hz) in the cortex and amygdala of both P rats and NP rats. In addition, allopregnanolone increased the predominant frequency of the cortical EEG in the 8 to 16 Hz bandwidth, decreased the predominant frequency in the 32 to 50 Hz bandwidth, and increased EEG variability (16-50 Hz). The effects of allopregnanolone were qualitatively similar in P and NP rats. However, P rats were more sensitive to low doses of allopregnanolone in cortex, whereas NP rats responded to lower doses of allopregnanolone in the amygdala.", 
    "96": "These data indicate that P and NP rats differ in their sensitivity to the EEG effects of allopregnanolone in the cortex and amygdala, which suggests that differences in GABAergic systems between P and NP rats may contribute to some of the differences observed in their behavioral repertoire.", 
    "97": "New halogen atom substituted 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives condensed with an azole ring on the seven membered part of the ring system of type 3 and 4 as well as 5 and 6 were synthesized. It was found that chloro-, dichloro- and bromo-substitutions in the benzene ring and additionally imidazole ring condensation on the diazepine ring can successfully substitute the methylenedioxy group in the well known molecules GYKI 52466 (1) and GYKI 53773 (2) and the 3-acetyl-4-methyl structural feature in 2, respectively, preserving the highly active AMPA antagonist characteristic of the original molecules. From the most active compounds (3b,i) 3b (GYKI 47261) was chosen for detailed investigations. 3b revealed an excellent, broad spectrum anticonvulsant activity against seizures evoked by electroshock and different chemoconvulsive agents indicating a possible antiepileptic efficacy. 3b was found to be highly active in a transient model of focal ischemia predictive of a therapeutic value in human stroke. 3b also reversed the dopamine depleting effect of MPTP and antagonized the oxotremorine induced tremor in mice indicating a potential antiparkinson activity.", 
    "98": "Male albino mice were given 35 mg cypermethrin/kg bw followed immediately by 1.0, 2.5 or 5 mg diazepam/kg, 5, 10 or 20 mg phenobarbitone/kg, or 10, 25 or 50 mg diphenylhydantoin/kg ip in dose groups of 10 mice each. Effectiveness of therapy was assessed by alleviation of effects and survival percentage. Rat brains implanted with electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyograhic electrodes were given 58 mg cypermethrin/ kg followed by 5 mg diazepam/kg, 20 mg phenobarbitone/kg, or 50 mg diphenylhydantoin/kg. Diazepam at 5 mg or 20 mg phenobarbitone/kg produced 100% survival and alleviated all the signs of poisoning while diphenylhydantoin produced 80% survival at 50 mg/kg. The antidotes antagonised desynchronization of EEG waves produced in rats exposed to cypermethrin. These results suggest involvement of GABA in the mechanism of cypermethrin action in addition to its established effect on the sodium ion channel.", 
    "99": "This is the first US report of continuous iv flumazenil infusion for benzodiazepine poisoning. A MEDLINE search from 1966 to 1999 revealed no similar reports in the US literature. A 24-y-o woman ingested 50, 2 mg (=100 mg) flunitrazepam tablets in a suicide attempt. She presented 30 min after ingestion with a temperature of 36.5 C, blood pressure of 90/36 mmHg, pulse of 84/min, and shallow respirations of 8/min. Her Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 8. Her ECG showed sinus rhythm at 80/min, a QRS axis of 30 with no terminal 40 msec deviation, and a QRS interval of 84 msec. She received 0.2 mg flumazenil iv and her GCS improved to 15. She was orogastrically lavaged and given 50 g of activated charcoal. Resedation to a GCS of 8 recurred twice, requiring additional 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg boluses of flumazenil iv, totaling 1.0 mg over 1 h. Then, a continuous flumazenil infusion was started at 1.0 mg/h, maintaining her GCS at 15. Fourteen h later, the continuous flumazenil infusion was terminated, resulting in resedation and clinical hypoventilation. Flumazenil infusion was restarted at 1.0 mg/h with resolution of sedation and hypoventilation. Thirty h after overdose flumazenil infusion was terminated without resedation or hypoventilation. Continuous iv flumazenil infusion is not US Food and Drug Administration approved, and further study is necessary in carefully selected patients to determine its safety and efficacy.", 
    "100": "In an attempt to improve liver slice culture for in vitro tests of newly developed drugs, we found that a relatively thick 2-mm slice was much more viable, long-lived, and metabolically functional than the conventionally used 300-microm-thick slices. Results revealed that some ionic and nonionic compounds (Na(125)I, [(14)C]Ala, and [(14)C]Xyl) dissolved in culture medium were absorbed into the slices, reaching from the cut edges deep into the inner part, in only a short period. Moreover, the slices could be observed for 24 h after incubation so that a normal histological image could be obtained. Each semi-microautoradiographic image was also clearly positive not only at the margin but also in the inner part of each slice. Furthermore, we determined the specific functioning of each donated liver for each substrate added, in uptake, metabolism, and excretion.", 
    "101": "Coadministration of olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic, with sulpiride, a selective D2 antagonist, is suggested as an efficient strategy for treating patients with resistant unremitting schizophrenia. The psychopharmacologic rationale that may account for the enhanced clinical efficacy of combining sulpiride with olanzapine and vice versa is the difference in affinity of the two drugs to brain receptors. Olanzapine affinity is related more to serotonin 5-HT2 than to dopamine-2, whereas sulpiride is considered a selective D2 blocker. The adjunction of a selective D2 antagonist to olanzapine may act as the olanzapine's augmentor by enhancing D2 blockage. This mode of treatment was introduced to six patients with chronic schizophrenia who showed noteworthy and rapid clinical improvement, supported by a decrease in their scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. No bothersome side effects were noticed. This clinical approach is in accordance with the findings of previous reports assessing the efficacy of the combined treatment of clozapine and sulpiride. The grounds for this treatment regimen using olanzapine rather than clozapine are discussed, calling for further studies to affirm the hypothesis and clinical results.", 
    "102": "Benzodiazepines are disproportionately prescribed to older adults. Elderly adults with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, elderly adults taking multiple medications, and elderly women are the most likely adults to continuously use benzodiazepines. These are also the groups of elderly who are likely to experience adverse effects, including falls, accidents, and motor vehicle crashes. Despite recommendations for short-term treatment and the potential risks of long-term use, some patients continue to receive benefit for extended time periods, occasionally years. Future research needs to be directed at improved identification of which patients will benefit from intermittent versus continuous treatment while minimizing risk for adverse side effects. In order to advance the study of the risks and benefits of benzodiazepine use, we have proposed a set of definitions for classification of use. These definitions can be used to develop clinical guidelines based on empirically derived clinical research models.", 
    "103": "Catatonic syndromes in patients under 18 appear sporadically in literature. It is probable that its frequency in the clinic is greater than is recognised. On the basis of study and treatment of an adolescent in the acute Unit in our service, an exhaustive revision of literature was realized. The most relevant conclusions that we can gather are the following: 1) the catatonic syndromes in adolescence obey a multitude of psychiatric and organic causes which make a minicule study which rules out somatic associated pathology obligatory; 2) among the psychiatric forms of catatonic syndrome in adolescence unusual pictures of unspecific psychosis may predominate although schizophrenia or affective pathologies are not infrequent together with unspecific psychoses; somatic ethiology (medical diseases or induced substances) is the most frequent; 3) benzodiazepines and ECT appear to be efficient and safe treatment for catatony in adolescents although, they require more investigation; 4) it is especially important to distinguish catatonic syndromes provoked by neuroleptics from those forms of malignant catatony associated with psychotic clinical pictures; 5) the studies realized among these populations are very scarce. It is necessary to look deeper into the psychotic psychopathology of infancy and adolescence and specifically in the infant-juvenile catatonic syndromes. The lack of clinical studies implied difficulties in recognising and adequate treatment of juvenile catatonic syndromes.", 
    "104": "Biodegradable hydrogel nanoparticles were prepared from glycidyl methacrylate dextran (GMD) and dimethacrylate poly(ethylene glycol) (DMP). GMD was synthesized by coupling of glycidyl methacrylate to dextran in the presence of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as an aprotic solvent. DMP was synthesized from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and methacryloyl chloride. GMD/DMP (abbreviated as DP) hydrogel was prepared by radical polymerization of GMD and DMP using ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) as an initiator and UV curing. DP hydrogel nanoparticles were obtained by diafiltration method using DMSO solution. The GMD and DMP were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fluorescence probe technique was used to investigate the self-assembly of DP in water using pyrene as a hydrophobic probe. The critical association concentration (CAC) was determined to be 5.6 x 10(-2) g/l. The shape of DP hydrogel nanoparticles was spherical when observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The size range of DP hydrogel nanoparticles was about 20 approximately 50 nm. The hydrodynamic size of DP hydrogel nanoparticles was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and gradually increased with time in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4). Drug release study was performed using clonazepam (CNZ) as a hydrophobic model drug. In vitro release rate of CNZ from the DP hydrogel nanoparticles was dependent on the existence of dextranase and the pH of the release medium.", 
    "105": "R,S-alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor up-modulators of the benzamide type (\"ampakines\") have previously been shown to enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in vivo and in vitro and AMPA receptor currents in excised patches. The present study analyzed the effects of an ampakine (CX614; 2H,3H, 6aH-pyrrolidino[2\",1\"-3',2']1,3-oxazino[6',5'-5,4]benz o[e]1, 4-dioxan-10-one) that belongs to a benzoxazine subgroup characterized by greater structural rigidity and higher potency. CX614 enhanced the size (amplitude and duration) of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in hippocampal slices and autaptically evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in neuronal cultures with EC(50) values of 20 to 40 microM. The compound blocked desensitization (EC(50) = 44 microM) and slowed deactivation of responses to glutamate by a factor of 8.4 in excised patches. Currents through homomeric, recombinant AMPA receptors were enhanced with EC(50) values that did not differ greatly across GluR1-3 flop subunits (19-37 microM) but revealed slightly lower potency at corresponding flip variants. Competition experiments using modulation of [(3)H]fluorowillardiine binding suggested that CX614 and cyclothiazide share a common binding site but cyclothiazide seems to bind to an additional site not recognized by the ampakine. CX614 did not reverse the effect of GYKI 52466 on responses to brief glutamate pulses, which indicates that they act through separate sites, a conclusion that was confirmed in binding experiments. In sum, these results extend prior evidence that ampakines are effective in enhancing synaptic responses, most likely by slowing deactivation, and that their effects are exerted through sites that are only in part shared with other modulators.", 
    "106": "Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone that is used clinically as a hypnotic. Although this drug is known to interact with neuronal gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, its binding site(s) within the receptor oligomer has been reported to be distinct from that of the classical benzodiazepines. After photoaffinity labeling with flunitrazepam, receptors in rat cerebellar membranes showed differentially reduced affinity for flunitrazepam and zopiclone by 50- and 3-fold, respectively. Because histidine 101 of the alpha-subunit is a major site of photolabeling, we have made specific substitutions of this residue and studied the consequences on the binding properties of zopiclone and diazepam using recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2-receptors transiently expressed in tsA201 cells. Both compounds showed similar binding profiles with receptors containing mutated alpha-subunits, suggesting a similar interaction with the residue at position 101. At alpha1beta2gamma3-receptors, flunitrazepam affinity was dramatically decreased by approximately 36-fold, whereas the affinity for zopiclone was decreased only 3-fold, suggesting a differential contribution of the gamma-subunit to the binding pocket. Additionally, we used electrophysiological techniques to examine the contribution of the gamma-subunit isoform in the receptor oligomer to ligand recognition using recombinant receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both compounds are agonists at alpha1beta2gamma2- and alpha1beta2gamma3-receptors, with flunitrazepam being more potent but less efficacious. In summary, these data suggest that histidine 101 of the alpha1-subunit plays a similar role in ligand recognition for zopiclone, diazepam, and flunitrazepam.", 
    "107": "We describe a model of self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE) induced by stimulation of the perforant path in free-running rats. In this model, seizures can be transiently suppressed by intrahippocampal injection of a blocker of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid/ kainate synapses but return in the absence of further stimulation when the drug ceases to act. However, seizures are irreversibly abolished by blockers of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors given locally or systemically. SSSE is enhanced by substance P and its agonists and blocked by its antagonists. SSSE induces novel expression of substance P-like immunoreactivity in hippocampal principal cells. These changes and those in other limbic peptides may contribute to the maintenance of SSSE and to the modulation of hippocampal excitability during epileptic seizures. NMDA",

For the second experiment, cells were isolated from 28- to 35-day-old naive rats and rats that had undergone 45 minutes of status epilepticus. Modulation of GABAA receptor currents by diazepam (DZP), zinc, and zolpidem was studied.",

    "114": "The effect of 20 nmol/L zolpidem on the decay time constant of inhibitory postsynaptic currents was significantly less in neurons from brain slices containing the freeze lesion. A higher concentration (100 nmol/L) of zolpidem was equally efficacious in lesioned and nonlesioned cortex. In lesioned cortex, the threshold for evoking epileptiform discharges was significantly increased in the presence of 10 micromol/L ifenprodil. This effect was significant in both intrinsic hyperexcitability and partial disinhibition with 2 micromol/L bicuculline in lesioned cortex. Ifenprodil had significantly less effect on the threshold of discharges evoked in control cortex in the partial disinhibition model.", 
    "115": "The decreased sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors to 20 nmol/L zolpidem in the freeze-lesion model is consistent with a delayed or arrested maturation in this animal model. These data support a delay in the developmental switch from alpha2 to alpha1 subunits in gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors of neocortical pyramidal cells in lesioned cortex. The increased ifenprodil sensitivity of the threshold for evoking epileptiform discharges in both control and disinhibited slices containing the microsulcus is explained by a delay in the expression of the 2A (NR2A) N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit. Delayed development may be a hallmark of this type of cortical dysplasia.",

    "122": "Our previous report showed that L754.394 and valspodar (PSC833) are potent inhibitors of midazolam hydroxylation in human jejunum microsomes and vectorial transport of vinblastine in Caco-2 cells, respectively. In the present study, to directly examine the interactions of these compounds as well as other substrates with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), we performed in vitro inhibition studies using recombinant CYP3A4-expressed microsomes and an MDR1-transfected cell line, LLC-MDR1, respectively. In CYP3A4-expressed microsomes, both L754.394 and ketoconazole, at a concentration less than 0.5 microM, are the most potent inhibitors of the formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, a major metabolite of midazolam formed by CYP3A4. The greatest inhibitory effect on the transcellular transport of digoxin in LLC-MDR1 cells was observed in the presence of valspodar (<0.1 microM), followed by verapamil. From a comparison of the IC(50) values, it was shown that L754.394 and valspodar exhibited the highest selectivity for CYP3A4 and P-gp, respectively. To demonstrate such specificity, both midazolam hydroxylation and digoxin transport were observed in CYP3A4 transfected Caco-2 cells, which coexpress both P-gp and CYP3A4, in the presence or absence of L754.394 (0.5 microM) and valspodar (1.0 microM). L754.394 almost completely inhibited midazolam hydroxylation, but not digoxin transport, whereas almost complete inhibition of digoxin transport was observed in the presence of valspodar, but inhibition of the hydroxylation was minimal. Thus, the present study has demonstrated that L754.394 has a specific inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, whereas valspodar is specific for P-gp.", 
    "123": "Phenyldiazene reacted with lymphoblast-expressed CYP3A4 to give a stable phenyl-iron complex that could be induced to rearrange in situ producing approximately equal amounts of four N-phenyl-protoporphyrin IX isomers (N(B):N(A):N(C):N(D), 01:01:02:02). In the presence of 10 mM MgCl(2), the formation profile of the protoporphyrin isomers was markedly altered compared with control, favoring the N(A) isomer (N(B):N(A):N(C):N(D), 01:34:01:02). In addition, an investigation of MgCl(2) effects on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of triazolam revealed that 10 mM MgCl(2) increased the apparent K(m) of triazolam 4-hydroxylation from 83 to 173 microM and reduced the V(max) for the reaction from 3.4 to 2.4 min(-1). Moreover, when the reaction kinetics of the oxidation of pyrene by CYP3A4 was examined in the absence of MgCl(2), it was found that the substrate-velocity curve was best approximated by a sigmoidal velocity curve (Hill coefficient 1.7 +/- 0.1). However, when the reaction was conducted in the presence of 10 mM MgCl(2), the resulting pyrene kinetics was not sigmoidal but rather biphasic (Hill coefficient 0.80 +/- 0.07). Based on the current results, it appears that CYP3A4 is conformationally sensitive to its in vitro environment and parameters, such as the presence of a divalent magnesium, can have a measurable effect on active site topography and consequently catalytic activity.", 
    "124": "This open-label clinical study was conducted for patients with schizophrenia in order to investigate the efficacy, safety and optimal dose of olanzapine. One hundred and fifty-six of the 159 enrolled patients were included in the analysis set. For the primary efficacy measure, the Final Global Improvement Rating (FGIR) score, 15.4% of patients had remarkable improvement, 58.3% of patients had moderate improvement or more, 79.5% of patients had slight improvement or more, and 10.3% of patients had increase in disease symptomatology (worsening). Results from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) in all individual items were improved from baseline. Olanzapine was effective not only against positive psychotic symptoms but also against negative symptoms. This was consistent with results from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). For the majority of patients, a dose range of 7.5-10.0mg/day, as a lower bound on the minimally effective dose, was suggested by the results of the dose to first response based on improvement in Global Improvement Rating (GIR) analyses. The ratio of olanzapine dose to equivalent haloperidol dose was estimated at 1.2 :1. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent signs and symptoms (TESS) occurring at a frequency of 10% or more were insomnia, weight increase, excitement, sleepiness, anxiety, malaise and dull headaches.

However, hyperactivity of the HPA axis in obesity has been reported. The objective of this study was to clarify the endocrine activity of GHS in obesity. In nine obese patients (obese OB), 9 F, age, (34.8 +/- 3.7 y, body mass index (BMI), 35.0 +/- 2.2 kg/m2; WHR, 0.9 +/- 0.02), 14 controls (normal subjects, NS), 14 F, 30.4 +/- 0.9 y, 20.0 +/- 0.4 kg/m2), we studied the ACTH, F and GH responses to hexarelin (HEX, 2.0 microg/kg), a peptidyl GHS, alone and preceded by alprazolam (ALP, 0.02 mg/kg), and a benzodiazepine which has an inhibitory effect on corticotroph secretion. The HEX-induced ACTH response in OB was higher than that in n.s., but this difference did not attain statistical significance. In n.s. the HEX-induced ACTH response was abolished by ALP (P < 0.03) which, however, only blunted that in OB (P < 0.02). The GH response to HEX in OB was lower (P < 0.02) than that in n.s.. ALP blunted the GH response to HEX in n.s. (P < 0.03) while it did not modify that in OB. The GABAergic activation by alprazolam abolishes the ACTH response to hexarelin in normal subjects, while it only blunts that in obese subjects. Moreover, alprazolam blunts the GH response to hexarelin in normal but not in obese subjects. Thus, obese patients show partial refractoriness to the inhibitory effect of alprazolam on both corticotroph and somatotroph function.",

Horses that moved 3 consecutive times in response to surgical stimulation or for which surgery time was > 60 minutes were administered an inhalant anesthetic, and data from these horses were excluded from analysis.", 
    "130": "Quality of induction was not significantly different among groups. Muscle relaxation and analgesia scores were lowest for horses given KD/KX, but significant differences among groups were not detected. Horses anesthetized with TKD had a significantly greater number of attempts to stand, compared with the other groups, and mean quality of recovery from anesthesia for horses in the TKD group was significantly worse than for the other groups. Anesthesia, surgery, and recovery times were not significantly different among groups.",

    "132": "Vertigo drug therapy is indicated only in few types of vertigo. A causal therapy is possible for infections of the inner ear by antibiotics or antiviral drugs. A symptomatic therapy of severe attacks of vertigo consists in the administration of sedative drugs like antihistaminics, benzodiazepines or neuroleptics. These drugs, however have to be used no longer than one week to avoid an inhibition of beneficial compensatory processes in the central nervous system. Furthermore, the use of non specifically acting blood flow increasing drugs like pentoxifylline in combination with prednisolone can be recommended. For the prophylaxis of Meni\u00e8re's disease, betahistine is the drug of choice because of its two modes of action (beneficial effect on the blood flow in the inner ear, inhibitory effect in vestibular nuclei). For prevention of vomiting as a consequence of vertigo, scopolamine is unsurpassed. In cases of psycogenicly caused vertigo, antivertiginosa from plant origin and homoeopathic drugs can be recommended, especially in the elderly patient, despite the fact that the effect of these drugs can not be fully explained as jet. Beside vertigo drug therapy, vertigo as a side effect of many drugs has to be taken into consideration in clinical routine. The variety of drugs responsible for vertigo consists in relatively harmless substances like aspirin up to substances used in vertigo drug therapy!", 
    "133": "Encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus during sleep or ESES is an age-dependent and self-limited syndrome whose distinctive features include a characteristic age of onset (with a peak around 4-5 years), heterogeneous seizures types (mostly partial motor or unilateral seizures during sleep and absences or falls while awake), a typical EEG pattern (with continuous and diffuse paroxysms occupying at least 85% of slow wave sleep) and a variable neuropsychological regression consisting of IQ decrease, reduction of language (as in acquired aphasia or Landau-Kleffner syndrome), disturbance of behaviour (psychotic states) and motor impairment (in the form of ataxia, dyspraxia, dystonia or unilateral deficit). Despite the long-term favourable outcome of epilepsy and status epilepticus during sleep (SES), the prognosis is guarded because of the persistence of severe neuropsychological and/or motor deficits in approximately half of the patients. No specific treatment has been advocated for this syndrome, but valproate sodium, benzodiazepines and ACTH have been shown to control the seizures and the SES pattern in many cases, although often only temporarily. Subpial transection is proposed in some instances as in non-regressive acquired aphasia. Recent data support the concept that ESES syndrome may include a large subset of developmental or acquired regressive conditions of infancy.", 
    "134": "Electroconvulsive therapy, which is used to treat refractory major depression in humans increases seizure threshold and decreases seizure duration. Moreover, the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor induced by electroshocks (ECS) might protect hippocampal cells from death in patients suffering from depression. As temporal lobe epilepsy is linked to neuronal damage in the hippocampus, we tested the effect of repeated ECS on subsequent status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine and leading to cell death and temporal epilepsy in the rat. Eleven maximal ECS were applied via ear-clips to adult rats. The last one was applied 2 days before the induction of SE by lithium-pilocarpine. The rats were electroencephalographically recorded to study the SE characteristics. The rats treated with ECS before pilocarpine (ECS-pilo) developed partial limbic (score 2) and propagated seizures (score 5) with a longer latency than the rats that underwent SE alone (sham-pilo). Despite this delay in the initiation and propagation of the seizures, the same number of ECS- and sham-pilo rats developed SE with a similar characteristic pattern. The expression of c-Fos protein was down-regulated by repeated ECS in the amygdala and the cortex. In ECS-pilo rats, c-Fos expression was decreased in the piriform and entorhinal cortex and increased in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Neuronal damage was identical in the forebrain areas of both groups, while it was worsened by ECS treatment in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices compared to sham-pilo rats. Finally, while 11 out of the 12 sham-pilo rats developed spontaneous recurrent seizures after a silent period of 40+/-27 days, only two out of the 10 ECS-pilo rats became epileptic, but after a prolonged latency of 106 and 151 days. One ECS-pilo rat developed electrographic infraclinical seizures and seven did not exhibit any seizures. Thus, the extensive neuronal damage occurring in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices of the ECS-pilo rats seems to prevent the establishment of the hyperexcitable epileptic circuit.", 
    "135": "Using the technique of intracellular recording in in vitro brain slice preparations, we examined the effects produced by repeated administration of the antipsychotic drugs clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol, on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced responses in pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex. Rats were anesthetized and decapitated 24h after the conclusion of daily intraperitoneal injection with either clozapine (25mg/kg), olanzapine (1, 5 or 10mg/kg) or haloperidol (0.5mg/kg) for 21 days, and the slices from medial prefrontal cortex were used for electrophysiological recordings. The concentration-response curves for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid to activate cortical cells shifted markedly to the right in rats which received the subchronic antipsychotic drug treatment, compared with those obtained from rats which received repeated injections of vehicle (1ml/kg/day, i.p. for 21 days). In addition, repeated exposure to antipsychotic drugs caused a significant reduction in the ability of these antipsychotic drugs to augment the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced inward current in pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex. Repeated administration of haloperidol, but not clozapine or olanzapine, significantly hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential and increased membrane resistance in pyramidal cells of the medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, subchronic treatment with haloperidol, but not clozapine or olanzapine, depressed (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-induced responses. The desensitized response of medial prefrontal cortex cells to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid could be the result of a compensatory response to the facilitating action of antipsychotic drugs on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor-mediated transmission. The inhibitory action of haloperidol on (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid responses may also contribute to the rightward shift of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid concentration-response curve.Thus, the present study suggests that the atypical antipsychotic drugs, clozapine and olanzapine, as well as the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol strongly modulate glutamatergic transmission after prolonged treatment. This might be an important factor in the mechanisms by which these drugs alleviate symptoms in schizophrenic patients.", 
    "136": "We have studied the mRNA expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and the binding of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand, [3H]-PK11195, in the spinal cord of Lewis rats where EAE was actively induced. PTX3 was induced during the active phase of EAE (day 10-14), it remained high up to 30 days and disappeared only 60 days later. Similarly, PK11195 binding peaked at day 14-17 during the recovery and it disappeared by day 60. On the other hand, the levels of TNF and IL-6 in the spinal cord were elevated at the peak and at the onset of clinical signs and returned to non-detectable by day 14-17. Dexamethasone abolished all these changes, while treatment with rolipram, delayed the appearance of the disease and then decreased its severity. However the peaks of TNF, IL-6, PBR and PTX3 levels in spinal cord were only delayed, but not reduced, by rolipram treatment. In conclusion, we show two types of inflammatory changes in EAE: acute, short term changes (TNF and IL-6), that correlate with the disease; and effects such as PTX3 expression and PK11195 binding that last longer after recovery from the disease.", 
    "137": "Social anxiety disorder is a chronic and disabling, yet treatable, condition. Effective treatment should alleviate the core domains of fear, anxiety and physiological symptoms, as well as reduce overall disability and improve social functioning. Response to treatment can, therefore, be assessed at a global level where overall improvement is considered, and at the level of individual symptoms. In considering the way in which response to treatment can be measured, this review also identifies several factors that may worsen the prognosis of social anxiety disorder. Clinical studies of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and benzodiazepines for the treatment of social anxiety disorder are presented and discussed. The accumulation of evidence supports the use of SSRIs as first line therapy for social anxiety disorder, and the majority of data come from well controlled studies of paroxetine. In line with the recommendations of the International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety, a strategy for the management of social anxiety disorder is provided.", 
    "138": "Olanzapine steady-state serum concentrations of 334 patients were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. The patients were subjected to routine therapeutic drug monitoring of antipsychotic treatment. In cases with more than one serum determination per patient, only the first measurement was included. Eighty-four percent of the patients received daily doses in the recommended range from 5 to 20 mg. The interval 25-140 nmol/l covered about 80% of the concentrations observed for the daily dose range 5-20 mg. This interval may be used as a reference for therapeutic drug monitoring of olanzapine, indicating whether a patient has a typical or an atypical concentration level at a given dose. Such a judgment may be helpful in situations characterized by side effects, insufficient effect, doubts about compliance or possible pharmacokinetic interactions.",

    "141": "Seventeen patients underwent high resolution MRI, FDG and FMZ PET, and presurgical EEG evaluation, including chronic intracranial ECoG monitoring or intraoperative ECoG. Regional cortical FDG/FMZ PET abnormalities were defined on partial volume-corrected PET images using an objective method based on a semiautomated definition of areas with abnormal asymmetry. Structural lesions were defined on coregistered MRI. The marked PET abnormalities visualized on three-dimensional cortical surface were compared with each other, to the extent of MRI-defined lesion, as well as to ECoG findings.", 
    "142": "The mean surface extent of FMZ PET abnormalities was significantly larger than the corresponding structural lesions, but it was significantly smaller than areas of glucose hypometabolism. The size of perilesional FDG PET abnormalities showed a correlation with the lifetime number of seizures (r = 0.93, p = 0.001). The extent of perilesional FMZ PET abnormalities was independent of the seizure number and showed an excellent correspondence with spiking cortex, the resection of which resulted in seizure-free outcome in all but one operated patient. Remote FMZ PET abnormalities (n = 6) were associated with early age at seizure onset (p = 0.048) and appeared in ipsilateral synaptically connected regions from the lesion area.", 
    "143": "Three-dimensional surface-rendered FMZ PET is able to delineate perilesional epileptic cortex, and it may be especially useful to localize such areas in patients with extensive perilesional glucose hypometabolism associated with a large number of seizures. Remote FMZ PET abnormalities in patients with early onset and long duration of epilepsy might represent secondary epileptogenesis, but this requires further study.",

Although clozapine is known to be an effective antipsychotic agent that does not significantly exacerbate parkinsonism, its use requires frequent blood count assessment.

    "151": "After 15 patients had completed the study, safety stopping rules were invoked because of exacerbated parkinsonism in olanzapine-treated subjects. UPDRS motor impairment scores from baseline to study end significantly increased with olanzapine treatment, and change scores between the olanzapine and clozapine groups significantly differed. The primary clinical domains responsible for the motor decline were gait and bradykinesia. Even with a smaller patient number than originally anticipated, clozapine significantly improved hallucinations and overall behavioral assessment, whereas olanzapine had no effect.",

The FDG permeability-surface area product (PS) was also significantly higher with PTZ treatment (0.36 +/- 0.05 ml. min(-1). g(-1)) than in controls (0.20 +/- 0.06 ml. min(-1). g(-1)). Cerebral blood flow rates were also elevated by 50% in seizures. The internal carotid artery perfusion technique indicated mean [(14)C]glucose clearance (and extraction) was increased with PTZ treatment, and seizures increased the PS by 37 +/- 16% (P < 0.05) in cortical regions. Because kinetic analyses suggested the glucose transporter half-saturation constant (K(m)) was unchanged by PTZ, we derived estimates of 1) treated and 2) control maximal transporter velocities (V(max)) and 3) a single K(m). In cortex, the glucose transporter V(max) was 42 +/- 11% higher (P < 0.05) in PTZ-treated animals (2.46 +/- 0.34 micromol. min(-1). g(-1)) than in control animals (1.74 +/- 0.26 micromol. min(-1). g(-1)), and the K(m) = 9.5 +/- 1.6 mM. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) V(max) was 31 +/- 10% greater (P < 0.05) in PTZ-treated (2.36 +/- 0. 30 micromol. min(-1). g(-1)) than control subcortex (1.80 +/- 0.25 micromol. min(-1). g(-1)). We conclude acute upregulation of BBB glucose transport occurs within 3 min of an initial seizure. Transporter V(max) and BBB glucose permeability increase by 30-40%.",

The sample consisted of European patients from a large, international, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either olanzapine (n = 520) or haloperidol (n = 258) for a 6-week acute phase followed by a 46-week maintenance phase for responders. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced superior improvements compared to haloperidol-treated patients on all efficacy measures assessed in both phases. A greater percentage of olanzapine-treated patients had > or = 20% improvement in the Quality of Life Scale total score during both the acute (50.0% versus 31.0%, P = 0.071) and maintenance (69.5% versus 41.7%, P = 0.006) phases compared to haloperidol-treated patients. For patients who entered the maintenance phase as outpatients, olanzapine-treated patients were significantly less likely to require subsequent hospitalization compared to haloperidol-treated patients (P = 0.001). A significantly greater percentage of the olanzapine group compared to the haloperidol group worked part-time or full-time (15.1% versus 5.3%, P = 0.018), participated in useful work > or = 75% of the time (21.0% versus 10.5%, P = 0.038), and socialized more than once a month (53.8% versus 37.9%, P = 0.004) during the maintenance phase. The findings from this study suggest that olanzapine's clinical profile leads to reduced hospitalization and improvements in work and social functioning superior to that achieved with haloperidol treatment.", 
    "156": "Five-day-old cultures of mouse glycinergic spinal interneurons were chronically treated with 100 mM ethanol and the glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors were assayed using whole-cell recordings and fluorescence-imaging techniques. Control neurons displayed a glycine(50) of 19 +/- 0.6 microM and a Hill coefficient of 3.1 +/- 0.3. Chronic ethanol treatment did not significantly change these parameters. The maximal responses were 310 +/- 80 pA/pF in control and 440 +/- 19 pA/pF in treated cells, and the fluorescence intensity associated to a monoclonal glycine receptor antibody was unchanged. Strychnine inhibited the glycine current with smaller potency (29%) in treated neurons, thus the IC(50) increased from 14 +/- 2 nM in control to 18 +/- 6 nM in treated neurons. Zn(2+) (10 microM) potentiated the glycine current by 43 +/- 33% in control, but only by 18 +/- 13% in treated neurons. Interestingly, no change on the inhibition produced by a high concentration of Zn(2+) was found in treated neurons. The inhibitory effect of picrotoxin on the glycine receptor, associated to a homomeric receptor, was eliminated with chronic ethanol, suggesting a faster switch to beta-subunit-containing receptors. Unlike glycine receptors, the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to GABA, pentobarbital, diazepam, and Zn(2+), as well as the fluorescence intensity associated to a high-affinity benzodiazepine analog was unchanged by chronic ethanol. In conclusion, we found that glycine receptors in spinal interneurons were altered by chronic ethanol treatment and this may reflect the expression of different subunits in control and treated neurons. GABA(A) receptors were resistant to the treatment."
