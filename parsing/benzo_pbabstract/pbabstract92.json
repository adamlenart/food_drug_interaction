Conformational analysis and superimposition of energy minima conformers of the novel compounds on estazolam, a known benzodiazepine agonist, revealed that the main proposed benzodiazepine pharmacophores were well matched. In pharmacological evaluation, anticonvulsant activity of the compounds determined by pentylenetetrazole-induced lethal convulsion and maximal electroshock tests. The results showed that the introduction of an amino substituent in position 5 of 1,3,4- oxadiazole ring generates compound 6 that has a considerable effect. Compound 8 with a hydroxyl substituent on position 5 of 1,3,4- oxadiazole ring showed a relatively mild anticonvulsant activity, which was significantly weaker than that of diazepam and compound 6. Anticonvulsant effects of active compounds were antagonized by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors, indicating the involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in these effects.",

Animals were allowed to re-establish stable cocaine self-administration and were then behaviorally extinguished from drug taking. The effects of GYKI 52466 (3, 10mg/kg, i.v.) on cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior were assessed. We found that GYKI 52466 failed to inhibit cocaine-taking and cocaine-seeking in both the self-administration and reinstatement paradigms.

CsA and Tac seem not only to be substrates of CYP3A but have also been described as inhibitors of CYP3A. For CsA, in particular, inhibition of CYP3A has been suggested as the main mechanism of interactions seen clinically with various drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect and inhibition characteristics of CsA and Tac on CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in vitro and to evaluate its clinical relevance. Inhibition by CsA and Tac was studied using midazolam as the probe substrate in coincubation and preincubation investigations using human liver microsomes (HLMs) as well as specific CYP3A4- and CYP3A5-expressing insect microsomes (Supersomes). In vitro-in vivo extrapolations (IVIVEs) were performed to evaluate the clinical relevance of the inhibition. Both CsA and Tac competitively inhibited CYP3A in HLMs, showing inhibition constants (K(i)) of 0.98 and 0.61 \u03bcM, respectively. Experiments in Supersomes revealed that Tac inhibited both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, whereas CsA only inhibited CYP3A4. In contrast to the HLM experiments, studies in Supersomes showed inhibition by Tac to be NADPH- and time-dependent, with a 5-fold reduction in IC(50) after preincubation, supporting a time-dependent inhibition mechanism in recombinant microsomes. By application of HLM data, IVIVE estimated the area under the concentration versus time curve of midazolam to increase by 73 and 27% with CsA and Tac, respectively. The inhibitory effect was predominantly on the intestinal level, whereas hepatic intrinsic clearance seemed unaffected.",

    "42": "Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine widely used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, has been aimed to be formulated in a transdermal delivery system (TDS) prototype. A series of TDS prototypes dosed in all cases at 0.35 mg\u00b7cm(-2) of alprazolam were prepared as a monolithic drug in adhesive matrix using acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) of acrylate vinyl acetate (Duro-tack(\u00ae)). The effects of several permeation enhancers as azone, transcutol, propylene glycol, dodecyl alcohol, decyl alcohol, diethanolamine, N-methyl pyrrolidone and lauric acid were studied. Prototypes have been characterized based on adhesion parameters (peel adhesion and shear adhesion), in vitro human skin permeation and in vitro drug release according to European Pharmacopoeia for the selected prototype. Best results show that a combination of permeation enhancers from different chemical groups is able to provide almost a 33 fold increase in the transdermal alprazolam flux of an aqueous saturated dispersion (from 0.054\u2009\u00b1\u20090.019 to 1.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21 \u03bcg h.cm(-2)).

    "43": "Indolylglyoxylamides are a class of distinctive benzodiazepine receptor ligands, proposed in the mid-eighties as open analogues of -carbolines. Thorough and long-lasting studies of their structure-activity relationships led to the development of a great deal of derivatives, to satisfy increasingly structural and pharmacophoric requirements of the benzodiazepine binding site in the central nervous system. Efforts to pre-organize their flexible structure in the three-dimensional shape adopted when bound to the receptor led to the identification of two novel classes of rigid ligands, characterized by planar tricyclic heteroaromatic cores: the [1,2,4]triazino[4,3-a]benzimidazol-4(10H)-one and the [1,2,3]triazolo[1,2-a][1,2,4]benzotriazin-1,5(6H)-dione.

    "44": "Anxiety disorders have been linked to alterations in \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. GABA interacts with the ligand-gated ion channels, GABAA receptor (GABAA-R) subtypes, and regulates the flow of chloride into the cell, causing neuron hyperpolarization. GABAA-Rs are assembled from a family of 19 homologous subunit gene products and form mostly hetero-oligomeric pentamers. The major isoforms of the GABAA-Rs contain \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits and show a regional heterogeneity that is associated with distinct physiological effects. A variety of allosteric ligands can modulate the response to GABA by binding at different sites on the GABAA-R complex. The best characterized binding site is the benzodiazepine (BZ) one, which is located at the \u03b1/\u03b3 subunit interface. BZs are commonly used in therapy for their effects as anxiolytic, anticonvulsants, myorelaxants and hypnotics. The broad range of pharmacological effects of classical BZs are mediated by the selective activation of different GABAA-R subtypes: the \u03b11 subunit containing BZ receptor (BZ-R) mediates sedation, the \u03b12 and \u03b13 subunit containing BZ-R mediates anxiolysis and myorelaxation, and the \u03b15 subunit containing BZ-R mediates cognitive impairment. Based on the current understanding of the diversity of the GABAA-R family, different approaches have been employed to develop drugs that target the GABAA/BZ-R complex with selective anxiolytic action and improved profiles. In this review, we present current knowledge about the role of the GABAA/BZ-R complex in anxiety disorders, new insights into the molecular biology of the receptor complex, and the importance of this target in the development of new therapeutic agents in anxiety.", 
    "45": "Anxiety disorders are frequent and disabling disorders. For short-term treatment, benzodiazepines are useful due to their rapid onset of anxiolytic action. However, these compounds have sedative properties and may induce tolerance, abuse liability and withdrawal symptoms. First-line choices for the long-term treatment are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The major disadvantage of these compounds is their delayed onset of action. It is obvious that there is a need for novel pharmacological approaches that combine a rapid anxiolytic efficacy with the lack of tolerance induction, abuse liability and withdrawal symptoms. A very important target for the development of such compounds is the -amino-butyric-acid (GABA)A receptor. Subtype specific benzodiazepines are being developed, but also phytotherapeutic agents experience a renaissance as GABAA receptor modulators. On the other hand, GABA related compounds, e.g. tiagabine, did not show pronounced anxiolytic efficacy. Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are potent modulators of GABAA receptors. To date synthetic neuroactive steroids could not be established in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Regarding endogenous neurosteroidogenesis, recently the translocator protein (18kDa) (TSPO) has been identified as a potential novel target. TSPO is supposed to play an important role for the synthesis of neuroactive steroids. TSPO ligands may promote the synthesis of neuroactive steroids via induction of cholesterol translocation to the inner mitochondrial membrane. First clinical studies revealed promising results. In this review, we discuss putative compounds affecting the GABAergic system which may provide the basis for fast acting anxiolytics with a favorable side effect profile.", 
    "46": "The Translocator Protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, is widely expressed in glial cells and in peripheral tissues and is involved in a variety of biological processes: steroidogenesis, cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis induction, etc. TSPO basal expression is up-regulated in a number of human pathologies, including a variety of tumors and neuropathologies, such as gliomas and neurodegenerative disorders (Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases), as well as in various forms of brain injury and inflammation. Furthermore, changes in TSPO receptor levels have been found in anxiety and mood disorders. Nowadays, considerable efforts have been focused on the identification of new TSPO ligands characterized by high-affinity and selectivity. In this review, we report and analyze the main experimental data and the computational procedures and validation methods used for the construction of the TSPO receptor and ligand-based models, describing in detail the most successful results and the new trends.", 
    "47": "The classical benzodiazepines (Bz) constitute a well-known class of therapeutics displaying hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects acting upon a specific binding site (BzR) belonging to the GABAA receptor complex. Their usefulness, however, is limited by a broad range of side effects; consequently the fact that the action of GABA with the receptor complex could be allosterically modulated by a wide variety of chemical entities, made the Bz binding site, from late eighties to nowdays, the target of extensive research programmes directed to the identification of new ligands displaying varying degrees of affinity- and efficacy-selectivity for the different GABAA/BzR-subtypes. The principal aim has been to discover ideal sedative-hypnotic agents (selective 1 agonists), anxiolytic agents (selective 2/ 3 agonists), or cognitive enhancers (selective 5 inverse agonists). In this connection, an important contribution in the field of GABAA/BzR ligands was made by the research group directed by Professor Antonio Da Settimo at the University of Pisa. The purpose of this review is therefore to describe the studies, performed from early '80s, on the several classes of BzR ligands developed featuring the indol-3-ylglyoxyl scaffold. All the compounds reported have been summarized on the basis of their main chemical structural features, focusing attention on their SARs, which determined the affinity profiles or efficacy-selectivity. Moreover, the biological studies performed within each class of compounds allowed the identification of new derivatives exhibiting an anxiolytic/nonsedative profile, either in vitro (full 2 agonism and 1 partial agonism/ antagonism) and in vivo (anxiolytic/nonsedative activity in mice).",

However, many patients who might benefit from treatment are not diagnosed or treated. This may partly be due to lack of awareness of the anxiety disorders by primary care practitioners and by the sufferers themselves. In addition, the stigma still associated with psychiatric disorders and lack of confidence in psychiatric treatments are factors leading to no/under recognition and treatment, or the use of unnecessary or inappropriate treatments. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of two common anxiety disorders, in particular obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder (PD). The first-line treatments of OCD include medium-high doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine, a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant with prevalent serotonergic activity. The recommended drugs for PD include SSRIs, TCAs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); in treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines like alprazolam may be used in patients with no history of addiction and tolerance. Other treatment options include irreversible and reversible monoamine-oxidase inhibitors, hydroxyzine, and others. Besides pharmacological treatments, some psychological strategies have been shown to be effective, in particular, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and other variants of behavior therapy that have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies, and, therefore, will be reviewed herein.", 
    "49": "Interaction between the so-called benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) and the chemically heterogeneous class of its ligands is still one of the most challenging objects of theoretical studies. In the mid-90s our group began to collaborate with Prof. Antonio Da Settimo and coworkers to a project of synthesis and biological evaluation of indolylglyoxylamides designed as BzR ligands. Herein we review our efforts in designing these compounds and in interpreting their structureaffinity relationships. Our investigations were carried out for years by adopting the pharmacophore/topological model for BzR ligands set up by Cook's group. In an attempt to rationalize some puzzling structure-affinity relationships we speculated in 1998 that our ligands interact with the BzR by assuming one of two alternative binding modes (called \"A\" and \"B\") depending on whether or not they were substituted at the 5-position of the indole nucleus. Such a model received support from a considerable amount of experimental data accumulated throughout our researches. About a decade later, docking calculations performed on a homology-built model of the 1 BzR subtype were found in agreement with the hypothesis of mode A and mode B of binding accessible to 5-H and, respectively, 5-Cl/NO2 indole derivatives.", 
    "50": "Chronic benzodiazepine (BDZ) abuse is currently treated with detoxification using a low-dose flumazenil infusion, a relatively recently developed and promising procedure. Given the possibility reported in the literature of the occurrence of generalized seizures during therapeutic BDZ detoxification, we usually administer preventive antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. We describe two patients with no previous history of seizures or evidence of intracerebral lesions who, during detoxification for benzodiazepine abuse, developed repetitive focal nonconvulsive seizures instead of generalized seizures, even with appropriate doses of preventive AED therapy. There are no previous reported cases of focal nonconvulsive seizures occurring during this procedure or, more generally, during abrupt BDZ discontinuation. The cases we describe suggest that during detoxification for BDZ abuse, not only generalized, but also focal nonconvulsive seizures may occur. In this context, the focal seizures probably result from a diffuse decrease in the seizure threshold (caused by a generalized excitatory rebound), which may trigger focal seizures arising from cortical regions with higher intrinsic epileptogenicity. Detoxification for benzodiazepine abuse, even if performed with adequate-dosage AED treatment, may not be as safe a procedure as previously considered, because not only convulsive, but also nonconvulsive seizures may occur and go unnoticed. It is therefore strongly advisable to perform this detoxification under close medical supervision and to maintain a low threshold for EEG monitoring in the event of sudden onset of behavioral changes.", 
    "51": "This long-term extension of an 8-week randomized, naturalistic study in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia compared the efficacy and safety of clonazepam (n = 47) and paroxetine (n = 37) over a 3-year total treatment duration. Target doses for all patients were 2 mg/d clonazepam and 40 mg/d paroxetine (both taken at bedtime). This study reports data from the long-term period (34 months), following the initial 8-week treatment phase. Thus, total treatment duration was 36 months. Patients with a good primary outcome during acute treatment continued monotherapy with clonazepam or paroxetine, but patients with partial primary treatment success were switched to the combination therapy. At initiation of the long-term study, the mean doses of clonazepam and paroxetine were 1.9 (SD, 0.30) and 38.4 (SD, 3.74) mg/d, respectively. These doses were maintained until month 36 (clonazepam 1.9 [SD, 0.29] mg/d and paroxetine 38.2 [SD, 3.87] mg/d). Long-term treatment with clonazepam led to a small but significantly better Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Improvement rating than treatment with paroxetine (mean difference: CGI-Severity scale -3.48 vs -3.24, respectively, P = 0.02; CGI-Improvement scale 1.06 vs 1.11, respectively, P = 0.04). Both treatments similarly reduced the number of panic attacks and severity of anxiety. Patients treated with clonazepam had significantly fewer adverse events than those treated with paroxetine (28.9% vs 70.6%, P < 0.001). The efficacy of clonazepam and paroxetine for the treatment of panic disorder was maintained over the long-term course. There was a significant advantage with clonazepam over paroxetine with respect to the frequency and nature of adverse events.", 
    "52": "Two randomized, double-blind, 26-week core studies (Eastern [EH] and Western Hemisphere [WH]) tested the hypothesis that asenapine is superior to olanzapine for persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia; 26-week extension studies assessed the comparative long-term efficacy and safety of these agents. In the core studies, 949 people were randomized to asenapine (n = 241 and 244) or olanzapine (n = 240 and 224); 26-week completion rates with asenapine were 64.7% and 49.6% (olanzapine, 80.4% and 63.8%) in the EH and WH, respectively. In the EH and WH extensions, respectively (asenapine, n = 134 and 86; olanzapine, n = 172 and 110), 52-week completion rates were 84.3% and 66.3% with asenapine (olanzapine, 89.0% and 80.9%). Asenapine was not superior to olanzapine in change in the 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment Scale total score in either core study, but asenapine was superior to olanzapine at week 52 in the WH extension study. Olanzapine was associated with modest, but significantly greater, changes in PANSS positive subscale score at various assessment times in both core studies and the WH extension study. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between treatments across studies. Weight gain was consistently lower with asenapine. Extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse event incidence was higher with asenapine (EH: 8.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1%-12.5%; WH: 16.4%; 95% CI, 11.9%-21.6%) than olanzapine (EH: 3.3%; 95% CI, 1.4%-6.4%; WH: 12.1%; 95% CI, 8.1%-17.0%), but Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale-Abbreviated total score changes did not significantly differ between treatments. In conclusion, asenapine superiority over olanzapine was not observed in the core studies. Both treatments improved persistent negative symptoms, but discontinuation rates were higher with asenapine.", 
    "53": "Most antipsychotic agents can cause QT prolongation, which causes torsades de pointes. The QT interval in healthy subjects is longer during nighttime than during daytime. The QT interval of patients treated with antipsychotics may be prolonged during nighttime, and the effects of antipsychotics on the QT interval may differ between antipsychotics. This study investigated the circadian dynamics of the QT interval in patients treated with antipsychotics and healthy controls, using a 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram in a clinical setting. Sixty-six patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia that were treated with risperidone or olanzapine and 40 healthy volunteers were enrolled. The QT intervals were corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF = QT / RR). Mean \u00b1 SD nighttime QTcFs were 411.6 \u00b1 29.0, 395.9 \u00b1 21.2, and 387.8 \u00b1 19.0 milliseconds (ms) in the risperidone, olanzapine, and control groups, respectively. The mean daytime QTcFs were 397.7 \u00b1 23.4, 392.4 \u00b1 18.9, and 382.6 \u00b1 17.3 ms, respectively. The mean nighttime QTcF of the risperidone group was significantly longer than that of the olanzapine and control groups, although there was no significant difference in the mean daytime QTcF between the risperidone and olanzapine groups. The current study used 24-hour Holter electrocardiograms to reveal significantly longer QT intervals in the risperidone group especially during nighttime. In clinical practices, evaluations of the QT interval have been conducted over short periods in the daytime, but it is believed that such methods may not be able to fully elucidate the effects of antipsychotics on the QT interval.", 
    "54": "Prolonged seizures [status epilepticus (SE)] constitute a neurological emergency that can permanently damage the brain. SE results from a failure of the normal mechanisms to terminate seizures; in particular, \u03b3-amino butyric acid-mediated inhibition, and benzodiazepine anticonvulsants are often incompletely effective. ATP acts as a fast neurotransmitter via ionotropic ligand-gated P2X receptors. Here we report that SE induced by intra-amygdala kainic acid in mice selectively increased hippocampal levels of P2X7 receptors relative to other P2X receptors. Using transgenic P2X7 reporter mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein, we identify dentate granule neurons as the major cell population transcribing the P2X7 receptor after SE. Pretreatment of mice with an intracerebroventricular microinjection of 1.75 nmol A438079, a P2X7 receptor antagonist, reduced seizure duration by 58% and reduced seizure-induced neuronal death by 61%. Injection of brilliant blue G (1 pmol), another selective antagonist, reduced seizure duration by 48% and was also neuroprotective. A438079 was seizure-suppressive when injected shortly after induction of SE, and coinjection of A438079 with lorazepam 60 min after triggering SE, when electrographic seizure-responsiveness to lorazepam had decreased, also terminated SE. Our results suggest that P2X7 receptor antagonists may be a promising class of drug for seizure abrogation and neuroprotection in SE.", 
    "55": "Early exposure to general anesthesia (GA) causes developmental neuroapoptosis in the mammalian brain and long-term cognitive impairment. Recent evidence suggests that GA also causes functional and morphological impairment of the immature neuronal mitochondria. Injured mitochondria could be a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which, if not scavenged in timely fashion, may cause excessive lipid peroxidation and damage of cellular membranes. We examined whether early exposure to GA results in ROS upregulation and whether mitochondrial protection and ROS scavenging prevent GA-induced pathomorphological and behavioral impairments. We exposed 7-day-old rats to GA with or without either EUK-134, a synthetic ROS scavenger, or R(+) pramipexole (PPX), a synthetic aminobenzothiazol derivative that restores mitochondrial integrity. We found that GA causes extensive ROS upregulation and lipid peroxidation, as well as mitochondrial injury and neuronal loss in the subiculum. As compared to rats given only GA, those also given PPX or EUK-134 had significantly downregulated lipid peroxidation, preserved mitochondrial integrity, and significantly less neuronal loss. The subiculum is highly intertwined with the hippocampal CA1 region, anterior thalamic nuclei, and both entorhinal and cingulate cortices; hence, it is important in cognitive development. We found that PPX or EUK-134 co-treatment completely prevented GA-induced cognitive impairment. Because mitochondria are vulnerable to GA-induced developmental neurotoxicity, they could be an important therapeutic target for adjuvant therapy aimed at improving the safety of commonly used GAs.", 
    "56": "Whether benzodiazepines (BZDs) have beneficial effects on the progress of chronic stress-induced impairment of hippocampal structural plasticity and major depression is uncertain. The present study designed four preclinical experiments to determine the effects of BZDs using chronic unpredictable stress model. In Experiment 1, several time course studies on behavior and hippocampus response to stress were conducted using the forced swim and tail suspension tests (FST and TST) as well as hippocampal structural plasticity markers. Chronic stress induced depression-like behavior in the FST and TST as well as decreased hippocampal structural plasticity that returned to normal within 3 wk. In Experiment 2, mice received p.o. administration of three diazepam dosages prior to each variate stress session for 4 wk. This treatment significantly antagonized the elevation of stress-induced corticosterone levels. Only low- (0.5mg/kg) and medium-dose (1mg/kg) diazepam blocked the detrimental effects of chronic stress. In Experiment 3, after 7 wk of stress sessions, daily p.o. diazepam administration during 1 wk recovery phase dose-dependently accelerated the recovery of stressed mice. In Experiment 4, 1 wk diazepam administration to control mice enhanced significantly hippocampal structural plasticity and induced an antidepressant-like behavioral effect, whereas 4 wk diazepam administration produced opposite effects. Hence, diazepam can slow the progress of chronic stress-induced detrimental consequences by normalizing glucocorticoid hormones. Considering the adverse effect of long-term diazepam administration on hippocampal plasticity, the preventive effects of diazepam may depend on the proper dose. Short-term diazepam treatment enhances hippocampal structural plasticity and is beneficial to recovery following chronic stress.", 
    "57": "A thin-film octadecyl (C18)-silica glass coating was developed as the extraction phase for an automated 96-blade solid-phase microextraction (SPME) system coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Various factors (e.g., sol-gel composition and aging time, coating preparation speed, coating thickness, and drying conditions) affecting the quality of C18-silica glass thin-film coating were studied and optimized. The results showed that the stability and durability of the coating are functions of the coating thickness and drying conditions. Coating thickness is controlled by sol-gel composition, aging time and the withdrawal speed in the dipping method. Automated sample preparation was achieved using a robotic autosampler that enabled simultaneous preparation of 96 samples in a 96-well plate format. Under the optimum SPME conditions the proposed system requires a total of 140 min for preparation of all 96 samples (i.e., 30 min preconditioning, 40 min equilibrium extraction, 40 min desorption and 30 min carry over step). The performance of the C18-silica glass 96-blade SPME system was evaluated for high-throughput analysis of benzodiazepines from phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and human plasma, and the reusability, repeatability, and validity of the system were evaluated. When analysing spiked PBS and human plasma, the inter-blade reproducibility for four benzodiazepines was obtained in the ranges of 4-8% and 9-11% RSD (relative standard deviation), respectively, and intra-blade reproducibility were in the ranges of 3-9% and 8-13% RSD, respectively. The limits of detection and quantitation for plasma analysis were in the ranges of 0.4-0.7 ng/mL and 1.5-2.5 ng/mL for all four analytes.",

A combination of moclobemide and fluoxetine has been used in refractory depression, however there is potential for severe serotonin toxicity. We describe a lethal case of serotonin toxicity in a 36 year-old woman after she ingested multiple drugs, including moclobemide 4500 mg, fluoxetine 200 mg, propranolol 300 mg and several benzodiazepines. The clinical features included coma, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremor, hyperreflexia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and respiratory insufficiency. Eventually, the patient died of disseminated intravascular coagulation and circulatory collapse at 22.5 h postingestion. Toxicological analysis of the patient's blood confirmed high levels of moclobemide 150 \u03bcg/mL (therapeutic 1-3 \u03bcg/mL), fluoxetine 3750 ng/mL (therapeutic 47-469 ng/mL) and several benzodiazepines. In conclusion, a combination of moclobemide and fluoxetine should be avoided in depressed patients with high suicidal tendencies. Moreover, early recognition and aggressive intervention are the mainstays in the management of potentially life-threatening serotonin toxicity.",

The studied scanning parameters included the frequency and duration of scans and scanning (nose-point) speed. The sensitivity of these parameters to anxiolytic diazepam (1-2\u00a0mg/kg) and anxiogenic FG-7142 (5\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated upon exposure to the context (conditioning chamber) before and 24\u00a0h after footshock.",

Diazepam dose-dependently decreased the scanning frequency and duration, without affecting the scanning speed. Fear conditioning increased freezing and inhibited other behaviors upon reexposure, with scanning being only marginally affected and still comprising 17\u2009\u00b1\u20092%, 16\u2009\u00b1\u20092%, and 19\u2009\u00b1\u20091% of reexposure time, respectively.

Lavender oil (Lavendula augustifolia) is reportedly anxiolytic in a number of species but little is known about how it affects individuals that are more or less anxious when faced with a stressor. In this study, we used changes in locomotor activity and the plasma concentrations of cortisol to test whether lavender oil would reduce behavioral and endocrine correlates of anxiety in calm and nervous sheep exposed to an isolation stressor. During the non-breeding season, 'calm' or 'nervous' female sheep from the UWA temperament flock were exposed to a mask containing either 1 mL of 10% lavender oil (calm: n=8; nervous: n=8) or peanut oil (calm: n=8; nervous: n=8). After 30 min, each sheep was isolated for 5 min and then returned to the group. Blood was sampled prior to the mask, prior to isolation, 1 min and 30 min after isolation to profile changes in the plasma concentrations of cortisol. Agitation score, locomotor activity and vocalizations were recorded as correlates of anxiety associated with the isolation stressor. Irrespective of whether they were exposed to lavender oil, calm sheep had a lower agitation score (P<0.001), crossed the central lines of the isolation box less frequently (P<0.001), expressed fewer vocalizations (P<0.001) and had lower plasma concentrations of cortisol immediately after isolation (P<0.001) than nervous sheep. Exposure of calm sheep to lavender oil decreased the agitation score (P<0.001), frequency of vocalizations (P<0.05), decreased the number of crosses of the central lines of the isolation box (P<0.05), and the plasma concentrations of cortisol prior to isolation (P<0.05) (after mask application) compared to calm control sheep. Exposure of nervous sheep to lavender oil increased the frequency of vocalizations (P<0.05), the number of sheep attempting to escape (P<0.05) and the plasma concentrations of cortisol 30 min after isolation (P<0.05) compared to nervous control sheep. We conclude that genetic differences in temperament determine whether lavender oil alleviates or exacerbates the behavioral and/or endocrine correlates of anxiety in sheep.", 
    "76": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase, an enzyme involved in regulating brain catecholamine levels, has been implicated in anxiety, pain and/or stress responsivity. Elements of this putative association remain unclarified, notably whether: (a) COMT variation modulates responses to acute and/or chronic stress equally; (b) acute pharmacological inhibition of COMT produces comparable effects on anxiety to that observed after deletion of the COMT gene; (c) COMT genotype modulates action of anxiolytic drugs. We aimed to further investigate the relationship between reduced COMT function, anxiety and stress responsivity in mice. To compare the effect of acute vs. chronic restraint stress in female COMT KO vs. WT mice, serum corticosterone and cytokine concentrations were measured [Experiment 1]. Sensitivity to the benzodiazepines midazolam and chlordiazepoxide in the light-dark test was assessed in female COMT KO vs. WT mice [Experiment 2]. Effects of acute administration of the COMT inhibitor tolcapone, and of these same benzodiazepines thereon, in the light-dark test were assessed in female C57BL/6 mice [Experiment 3]. COMT KO mice demonstrated an increased corticosterone response to acute but not chronic stress, and a modified cytokine profile after chronic, but not acute stress. COMT KO mice showed increased anxiety, but benzodiazepine sensitivity was affected by COMT genotype. Whilst tolcapone had no effect on light/dark performance in C57BL6/J mice it decreased benzodiazepine sensitivity. These data elaborate earlier findings of increased anxiety in female COMT KO mice and also clarify a role for COMT in modulating stress-related hormonal and immune parameters in a manner that depends on chronicity of the stressor.",

    "78": "Falls are a common health problem for older people, and psychotropic medications have been identified as an important independent fall risk factor. The objective of this paper was to review the literature relating to the effect of psychotropic medications on falls in older people, with a particular focus on evidence supporting minimization of their use to reduce risk of falls. A literature search identified 18 randomized trials meeting the inclusion criteria for the review of effectiveness of psychotropic medication withdrawal studies, including four with falls outcomes. One of these, which targeted reduced psychotropic medication use in the community, reported a 66% reduction in falls, while the other studies demonstrated some success in reducing psychotropic medication use but with mixed effects on falls. Other randomized trials evaluated various approaches to reducing psychotropic medications generally or specific classes of psychotropic medications (e.g. benzodiazepines), but did not report fall-related outcomes. Overall, these studies reported moderate success in reducing psychotropic medication use, and a number reported no or limited worsening of key outcomes such as sleep quality or behavioural difficulties associated with withdrawal of psychotropic medication use. Reduced prescription of psychotropic medications (e.g. seeking non-pharmacological alternatives to their use in place of prescription in the first place or, for those patients for whom these medications are deemed necessary, regular monitoring and efforts to cease use or wean off use over time) needs to be a strong focus in clinical practice for three reasons. Firstly, psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed for older people, both in the community and especially in the residential care setting, and their effectiveness in a number of clinical groups has been questioned. Secondly, there is strong evidence of an association between substantially increased risk of falls and use of a number of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines (particularly, the long-acting agents), antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs. Finally, the largest effect of any randomized trial of falls prevention to date was achieved with a single intervention consisting of weaning psychotropic drug users off their medications.",

Clearance was essentially independent of body weight. A rapid onset and dose-dependent sedation was observed after administration of remimazolam at 0.05 mg/kg and higher. Remimazolam (0.075 to 0.20 mg/kg) induced peak sedation levels similar to or higher than those achieved with midazolam (0.075 mg/kg).

We investigated the utility of this strategy.Methods Systematic computer-based search in the online library Pubmed for randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials (RCT) from the years 1990 to 2011.Results We found 14 RCT about augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics in depressive patients with non-response to antidepressants. Trials examined olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole.Conclusions Augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics is an alternative to the augmentation with lithium in unipolar depressive patients with non-response to antidepressants. But treatment with atypical antipsychotics as opposed to placebo increases the risk of non-compliance due to side-effects of medication. Augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics in unipolar depression is an off-label therapy in Germany except for the augmentation with extended-release quetiapine. Knowledge about treatment strategies regarding augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics can increase the chance of a successful treatment, but interactions and side-effects should be considered.",

    "88": "Antihistamines have been classifed as first or second generation drugs, according to their pharmacokinetic properties, chemical structure and adverse effects. The adverse effects of antihistamines upon the central nervous system (CNS) depend upon their capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and bind to the central H1 receptors (RH1). This in turn depends on the lipophilicity of the drug molecule, its molecular weight (MW), and affinity for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (CNS xenobiotic substances extractor protein). First generation antihistamines show scant affinity for P-gp, unlike the second generation molecules which are regarded as P-gp substrates. Histamine in the brain is implicated in many functions (waking-sleep cycle, attention, memory and learning, and the regulation of appetite), with numerous and complex interactions with different types of receptors in different brain areas. Bilastine is a new H1 antihistamine that proves to be effective in treating allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (seasonal and perennial) and urticaria. The imaging studies made, as well as the objective psychomotor tests and subjective assessment of drowsiness, indicate the absence of bilastine action upon the CNS. This fact, and the lack of interaction with benzodiazepines and alcohol, define bilastine as a clinically promising drug with a good safety profile as regards adverse effects upon the CNS.", 
    "89": "The circadian clock coordinates daily oscillations of essential physiological and behavioral processes. Conversely, aberrant clocks with damped amplitude and/or abnormal period have been associated with chronic diseases and aging. To search for small molecules that perturb or enhance circadian rhythms, we conducted a high-throughput screen of approximately 200,000 synthetic compounds using Per2lucSV reporter fibroblast cells and validated 11 independent classes of molecules with Bmal1:luciferase reporter cells as well as with suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissue explants. Four compounds were found to lengthen the period in both central and peripheral clocks, including three compounds that inhibited casein kinase I\u03b5 in vitro and a unique benzodiazepine derivative acting through a non-GABA(A) receptor target. In addition, two compounds acutely induced Per2lucSV reporter bioluminescence, delayed the rhythm, and increased intracellular cAMP levels, but caused rhythm damping. Importantly, five compounds shortened the period of peripheral clocks; among them, four compounds also enhanced the amplitude of central and/or peripheral reporter rhythms. Taken together, these studies highlight diverse activities of drug-like small molecules in manipulating the central and peripheral clocks. These small molecules constitute a toolbox for probing clock regulatory mechanisms and may provide putative lead compounds for treatment of clock-associated diseases.",

Nevertheless, no studies have compared this agent to another sedative agent used for sedation after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective was to compare the effects of propofol to midazolam on cerebral biomarkers at the acute phase of severe TBI patients. Thirty patients aged 35\u00b118 years were prospectively randomized to receive propofol or midazolam and 29 were analyzed (n=15 for propofol, and n=14 for midazolam). A cerebral microdialysis catheter was used to measure the lactate:pyruvate (L:P) ratio, glutamate, glycerol, and glucose for 72\u2009h.

Mass balance was studied daily in excretions of mice (feces and urine) for 5-10 days. We observed that monoexponential renal excretion of (14)C-cinazepam and its metabolites predominated with all dosage regimens. Cinazepam and its metabolites were almost fully (> 90%) eliminated in urine and feces over the period of study (5-10 days), which means that no significant accumulation of the drug in the body occurred. The kinetic parameters of drug excretion were not significantly different after a single injection compared with those following multiple doses of (14)C-cinazepam administration. This finding suggests the absence of induction (repression) of enzymatic systems after multiple administration and lack of influence on the kinetic scheme of cinazepam elimination from mice. In our work, we also presented a modification of the Mansgeldorf's method for analysis of kinetic parameters during multiple administration of the tranquilizer. We demonstrated that our modified approach could be equally and efficiently applied for interpreting experimental data during a single dose administration and after chronic administration of xenobiotics. The use of this method made it possible to evaluate the relative efficiency of elimination processes and to find current values for excretion constants during sampling intervals.",

The current study examined whether flumazenil can attenuate the combined effects of two benzodiazepines, midazolam and flunitrazepam, and the combined effects of midazolam and the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone, in four monkeys discriminating midazolam. Each positive modulator produced \u226580% midazolam-lever responding. Interactions between midazolam and either flunitrazepam or pregnanolone were additive. Flumazenil antagonized the benzodiazepines when they were administered alone or in combination. Schild analyses yielded slopes that did not deviate from unity, regardless of whether benzodiazepines were administered alone or together; the pA(2) value for flumazenil was 7.58. In contrast, flumazenil enhanced the effects of pregnanolone with 0.32 mg/kg flumazenil shifting the pregnanolone dose-effect curve 2-fold leftward. Flumazenil attenuated the combined effects of midazolam and pregnanolone, although antagonism was not dose-dependent. Thus, the interaction between two benzodiazepines was similar to that of a benzodiazepine and a neuroactive steroid; however, flumazenil more efficiently attenuated a combination of two benzodiazepines compared with a combination of a benzodiazepine and a neuroactive steroid. Although the magnitude of antagonism of a benzodiazepine combined with a neuroactive steroid was reduced, these results support continued exploration of the use of combinations of positive modulators to enhance therapeutic effects while reducing adverse effects.",

We conducted one-trial passive avoidance task with pre-retention trial drug administration in the hippocampus to test the effects of GABA(A) receptor modulation on memory retrieval. We further tested the co-involvement of signaling molecules: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB). First, we observed that the phosphorylation of hippocampal ERK was required for memory retrieval during the task. Accordingly, to investigate whether GABA(A) receptor activation or inhibition induces ERK phosphorylation during memory retrieval, drugs that target the GABA(A) receptor were administered into the hippocampus before the retention trial. Muscimol, a GABA(A) receptor agonist, and diazepam, an agonist to benzodiazepine-binding site of GABA(A) receptor, blocked retention trial-induced ERK phosphorylation and impaired memory retrieval. Furthermore, co-treatment with sub-effective dose of U0126, a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, blocked the upregulation of ERK phosphorylation and impaired memory retrieval, and bicuculline methiodide (BMI), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, increased ERK phosphorylation induced by the retention trial and facilitated memory retrieval. Finally, the effects of BMI were blocked by the co-application of a sub-effective dose of U0126.

The diagnosis of such disorders is complex due to the fact that they may appear as medical conditions. Hence, most of somatoform patients do not seek psychiatric assistance. The common feature of somatoform disorders as described in DSM-IV-TR is the presence of physical symptoms suggesting an underlying medical condition that is either not found or does not account for the level of functional impairment. The diagnostic criteria for the somatoform disorders were established for adults and are applied to children for lack of child-specific research base and a developmentally appropriate alternative system. The most common somatoform disorders in children and adolescents are recurrent abdominal pain and tension headache. Other disorders in the category include: somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorder, hypochondriasis and body dysmorphic disorder Treatment is applied through a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. SSRI'S are effective in somatoform disorders that have co-morbidity with anxiety and depression as well as in body dysmorphic disorder and hypochondriasis. Conversion disorder is usually treated with benzodiazepines and pain disorder with light analgesics, tricyclics and tegretol. In terms of psychotherapy, treatments most effective for somatoform disorders have been found to be cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback.",

    "152": "GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b12/3 subunits are current targets in the battle to develop new pain medications, as they are expressed in the spinal cord where increasing inhibitory drive should result in analgesia. However, this approach is prone to a range of side effects including sedation, cognitive impairment, and abuse as a consequence of the widespread influence of GABA. The ability to make subtype selective low-efficacy benzodiazepine compounds, which potentiate the action of GABA at specific \u03b1 subunits, has the potential to reduce this side effect profile. In this study, we have investigated the effects of the medium-efficacy positive allosteric modulator (PAM) L-838,417 and the low-efficacy PAM TPA023 in a number of preclinical inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. We conclude that either the higher level of efficacy at \u03b12/3 or efficacy at \u03b15 is required for compounds to have a significant analgesic effect in a range of models, and, therefore, although the side-effect profile of compounds can be reduced compared to typical benzodiazepines, it is unlikely that it can be completely eliminated.",

Telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours was administered from day 8 through day 23, along with a single IV dose of 0.5 mg of midazolam on day 17 and single oral doses of 2 mg of midazolam and 0.5 mg of digoxin on day 19. Midazolam, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, digoxin, and telaprevir concentrations in plasma and digoxin concentrations in urine were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. On comparing administration with versus without telaprevir, the geometric least squares mean ratios (with 90% confidence limits) for IV midazolam were 1.02 (0.80, 1.31) for maximum observed concentrations (C(max)) and 3.40 (3.04, 3.79) for area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24h)); for oral midazolam 2.86 (2.52, 3.25) for C(max) and 8.96 (7.75, 10.35) for AUC(0-24h); and for oral digoxin 1.50 (1.36, 1.65) for C(max) and 1.85 (1.70, 2.00) for area under the curve from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-\u221e)). Coadministration of telaprevir with oral midazolam resulted in approximately 3-fold decrease in the mean AUC(0-\u221e) of 1'-hydroxymidazolam. The renal clearance of digoxin was similar with or without telaprevir. Results show that telaprevir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein.",

Each of these perspectives contributes new insights into drug action, particularly for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The aim of this study was to develop a fluorescein derivative, FLUO-QUIN-a novel antagonist of the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor. A radioligand-binding experiment revealed an IC(50) of 4.79 nm, and the antagonist inhibited gastric acid secretion in an isolated lumen-perfused mouse stomach assay (up to 51\u2009% at 100 nm). The fluorescence properties altered upon binding to the receptor, and the fluorophore was quenched to a greater extent when free than in the bound form. FLUO-QUIN specifically bound to human pancreatic carcinoma cells, MiaPaca-2, which are known to express the receptor, as evidenced by rapid clustering followed by time-dependent receptor internalization. This proves the stability of FLUO-QUIN and its ability to penetrate vesicular membranes and reach various cell targets.

Rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPCLs) were found to have no evidence of effect on myopic eye growth in two studies (no meta-analysis due to heterogeneity between studies). Progressive addition lenses (PALs), reported in four studies, and bifocal spectacles, reported in four studies, were found to yield a small slowing of myopia progression. For seven studies with quantitative data at one year, children wearing multifocal lenses, either PALs or bifocals, progressed on average 0.16 D (95% CI 0.07 to 0.25) less than children wearing SVLs. The largest positive effects for slowing myopia progression were exhibited by anti-muscarinic medications.

On three occasions, the victim consumed green tea and chocolate before being massaged and ultimately sexually abused. Screening for alcohol, commonly used drugs and illicit substances in blood and urine sampled during the forensic examination 20\u00a0h after the last incident, was negative. Consequently, hair samples for chemical analysis were taken from the assaulted individual 34\u00a0days after the last incidents. The hair was cut into three 2-cm segments (0-6\u00a0cm) that were washed, dissolved in extraction solvent and screened and verified by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) and with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), respectively.

Activity-dependent transcription of genes for neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to promote epileptogenesis; however, little is known about factors that may act as intrinsic, homeostatic or counterbalancing mechanisms. Using rodent models, here we show that limbic seizure activity upregulated NRG1-ErbB4 signaling and that epileptogenesis was inhibited by infusing NRG1 intracerebrally but exacerbated by neutralizing endogenous NRG1 with soluble ErbB4 extracellular domain, by inhibiting ErbB4 activation or by deleting the Erbb4 gene. Furthermore, specific depletion of ErbB4 in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons abolished NRG1-mediated inhibition of epileptogenesis and promoted kindling progression, resulting in increased spontaneous seizures and exuberant mossy fiber sprouting. In contrast, depleting ErbB4 in CaMKII\u03b1-positive pyramidal neurons had no effect. Thus, NRG1-induced activation of ErbB4 in parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons may serve as a critical endogenous negative-feedback mechanism to suppress limbic epileptogenesis.",

Both actions are thought to reflect intrinsic antipsychotic activity. The present study examined the extent to which antipsychotic-induced sensitization in one model (e.g. CAR) can be transferred or maintained in another (e.g. PCP hyperlocomotion) as a means of investigating the contextual and behavioral controls of antipsychotic sensitization. Well-trained male Sprague-Dawley rats were first repeatedly tested in the CAR or the PCP (3.2 mg/kg, subcutaneously) hyperlocomotion model under HAL or OLZ for 5 consecutive days. Then they were switched to the other model and tested for the expression of sensitization. Finally, all rats were switched back to the original model and retested for the expression of sensitization. Repeated HAL or OLZ treatment progressively disrupted avoidance responding and decreased PCP-induced hyperlocomotion, indicating a robust sensitization. When tested in a different model, rats previously treated with HAL or OLZ did not show a stronger inhibition of CAR-induced or PCP-induced hyperlocomotion than those treated with these drugs for the first time; however, they did show such an effect when tested in the original model in which they received repeated antipsychotic treatment. These findings suggest that the expression of antipsychotic sensitization is strongly influenced by the testing environment and/or selected behavioral response under certain experimental conditions. Distinct contextual cues and behavioral responses may develop an association with unconditional drug effects through a Pavlovian conditioning process. They may also serve as occasion setters to modulate the expression of sensitized responses. As antipsychotic sensitization mimics the clinical effects of antipsychotic treatment, understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of antipsychotic sensitization and its contextual control would greatly enhance our understanding of the psychological and neurochemical nature of antipsychotic treatment in the clinic.",

    "189": "Zebrafish larvae are ideally suited for high-throughput analyses of vertebrate behavior. The larvae can be examined in multiwell plates and display a range of behaviors during early development. Previous studies have shown that zebrafish larvae display a preference for the edge of the well and several lines of evidence suggest this edge preference (thigmotaxis) may be a measure of anxiety. In the present study, we further examined the relation between edge preference and anxiety by imaging zebrafish larvae exposed to three psychoactive drugs diazepam (Valium), fluoxetine (Prozac), and caffeine. The edge preference was first examined in a five-fish assay, with and without visual stimuli. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine that binds to GABA receptors, reduced the larval edge preference, with or without visual stimuli. In contrast, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, did not affect the edge preference. Caffeine increased the preference for the edge in response to visual stimuli. Similar effects were observed in a two-fish assay; diazepam-exposed larvae showed a reduced edge preference and caffeine exposed larvae showed an increased edge preference. These results suggest that the edge preference in zebrafish larvae is a measure of anxiety and further illustrate that the pharmaceuticals used in the study have different mechanisms of action. Although there are substantial differences between zebrafish and human brains, our results indicate that the signals that regulate anxiety are similar on a molecular level. We propose that high-throughput assays in zebrafish may be used to uncover genetic or environmental factors that cause anxiety disorders and may contribute to the development of novel strategies to prevent or treat such disorders.",

    "194": "The results indicate that the orally administered hydroalcoholic extract of Achillea millefolium L. exerted anxiolytic-like effects that likely were not mediated by GABA(A)/BDZ neurotransmission and did not present tolerance after short-term, repeated administration.", 
    "195": "We studied whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO(2)) treatment, which is known to increase production of nitric oxide (NO) in the brain, might also produce an NO-dependent anxiolytic-like behavioral response.", 
    "196": "Male NIH Swiss mice (20-25g) were subjected to a 60-min HBO(2) treatment at different absolute atmospheres, and anxiety was assessed using the light/dark exploration test at different time intervals following the cessation of HBO(2) treatment. To ascertain the underlying mechanism of action, other groups of mice were pretreated with the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate, the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxy-3-oxide (carboxy-PTIO), the soluble guanylyl cyclase-inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) or the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil to determine their influence on the HBO(2)-induced anxiolytic-like effect.", 
    "197": "A 60-min HBO(2) treatment at 3.0 absolute atmospheres increased the time spent by mice in the light compartment that lasted up to 90 min following the end of HBO(2) treatment. This anxiolytic effect of HBO(2) was significantly reduced by pretreatment with L-NMMA, carboxy-PTIO, ODQ and flumazenil.", 
    "198": "Based on these findings, we conclude that a 60-min HBO(2) treatment is capable of inducing an anxiolytic effect that possibly involves NO, cyclic GMP and the benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "199": "Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a neurological disease of unknown aetiology. It is defined by the presence of a 10-20 Hz tremor in the legs while standing still. Symptoms described are dizziness and instability that diminish if the patient sits down or leans on something; drinking small amounts of alcohol significantly reduces OT. Due to the dizziness and/or unsteadiness, these patients are usually referred to the neuro-otology department. We report 4 cases diagnosed with OT. The diagnosis of OT should be considered for patients with instability. The clinical history is a key factor to suspect this entity, and the diagnosis is given by the register of 10-20 Hz contractions on limb electromyography. Treatment for this disease consists of medical treatment; the first option is clonazepam.", 
    "200": "Little is known about the characteristics of injection drug users (IDU) who take methadone treatment in Thailand. We examined prevalence and correlates of methadone treatment among a community-recruited sample of IDU in Bangkok, Thailand. Among 273 participants, 143 (52.4%) reported accessing methadone treatment within the previous 6 months. Older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-3.30) and more than weekly midazolam injection (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.04-3.29) were positively associated, whereas alcohol use (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.18-0.63) and noninjection methamphetamine use (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.29-0.85) were negatively associated with methadone treatment. In subanalyses, 98.6% of IDU on methadone continued to inject drugs, and the most common reason for stopping methadone was becoming incarcerated (49%). Evidence-based addiction treatment in the form of methadone maintenance therapy, with attention paid to concomitant midazolam injection in this setting, should be implemented.",

The sample had a global cognitive performance score at baseline about one standard deviation below that of the general population. The ziprasidone group had the fastest increase in global functioning which was significantly superior to that of the olanzapine group for the entire follow-up period. Before 90 days, the quetiapine group had the fastest increase which was statistically superior to the olanzapine group.",

    "207": "After approval by the Institutional Review Board, 40 severely brain-injured patients were included. They had received continuous administration of midazolam and sufentanil or fentanyl for median 15 days. On cessation of midazolam infusion, patients were given clorazepate for 3 days. On cessation of opioid infusion and clorazepate, clinical data were collected for 48 hours: heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, agitation, and pupil diameter. If an opioid withdrawal syndrome occurred, patients received a 48-hour continuous infusion of buprenorphine.", 
    "208": "Of 40 patients, there were 10 who did not require buprenorphine. An agitation occurred 5 hours (1-21) after cessation of opioid, associated with tachycardia, arterial hypertension, and tachypnea. After 6 hours buprenorphine treatment, these parameters were normalized. No patient needed the reintroduction of the initial sedation.",

There was, however, a significant interaction effect between medication grouping and executive function (F(1,98) = 15.32, P < .001): clozapine exerted an antiaggression effect even in the presence of executive dysfunction.", 
    "219": "Executive function was a strong predictor of response to antiaggression treatment in all medication groups, but clozapine still retained clinical efficacy in the presence of poor executive functioning. Olanzapine was particularly efficacious in the absence of executive dysfunction.

    "240": "sec-Butyl-propylacetamide (SPD) is a one-carbon homolog of valnoctamide (VCD), a central nervous system (CNS)-active amide derivative of valproic acid (VPA) currently in phase II clinical trials. The study reported herein evaluated the anticonvulsant activity of SPD in a battery of rodent seizure and epilepsy models and assessed its efficacy in rat and guinea pig models of status epilepticus (SE) and neuroprotection in an organotypic hippocampal slice model of excitotoxic cell death.", 
    "241": "The anticonvulsant activity of SPD was evaluated in several rodent seizure and epilepsy models, including maximal electroshock (MES), 6-Hz psychomotor; subcutaneous (s.c.) metrazol-, s.c. picrotoxin, s.c. bicuculline, and audiogenic, corneal, and hippocampal kindled seizures following intraperitoneal administration. Results obtained with SPD are discussed in relationship to those obtained with VPA and VCD. SPD was also evaluated for its ability to block benzodiazepine-resistant SE induced by pilocarpine (rats) and soman (rats and guinea pigs) following intraperitoneal administration. SPD was tested for its ability to block excitotoxic cell death induced by the glutamate agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid (KA) using organotypic hippocampal slices and SE-induced hippocampal cell death using FluoroJade B staining. The cognitive function of SPD-treated rats that were protected against pilocarpine-induced convulsive SE was examined 10-14 days post-SE using the Morris water maze (MWM). The relationship between the pharmacokinetic profile of SPD and its efficacy against soman-induced SE was evaluated in two parallel studies following SPD (60 mg/kg, i.p.) administration in the soman SE rat model.", 
    "242": "SPD was highly effective and displayed a wide protective index (PI = median neurotoxic dose/median effective dose [TD(50)/ED(50)]) in the standardized seizure and epilepsy models employed. The wide PI values of SPD demonstrate that it is effective at doses well below those that produce behavioral impairment. Unlike VCD, SPD also displayed anticonvulsant activity in the rat pilocarpine model of SE. Thirty minutes after the induction of SE, the calculated rat ED(50) for SPD against convulsive SE in this model was 84 mg/kg. SPD was not neuroprotective in the organotypic hippocampal slice preparation; however, it did display hippocampal neuroprotection in both SE models and cognitive sparing in the MWM, which was associated with its antiseizure effect against pilocarpine-induced SE. When administered 20 and 40 min after SE onset, SPD (100-174 mg/kg) produced long-lasting efficacy (e.g., 4-8 h) against soman-induced convulsive and electrographic SE in both rats and guinea pigs. SPD ED(50) values in guinea pigs were 67 and 92 mg/kg when administered at SE onset or 40 min after SE onset, respectively. Assuming linear pharmacokinetics (PK), the PK-PD (pharmacodynamic) results (rats) suggests that effective SPD plasma levels ranged between 8 and 40 mg/L (20 min after the onset of soman-induced seizures) and 12-50 mg/L (40 min after the onset of soman-induced seizures). The time to peak (t(max)) pharmacodynamic effect (PD-t(max)) occurred after the PK-t(max), suggesting that SPD undergoes slow distribution to extraplasmatic sites, which is likely responsible for antiseizure activity of SPD.", 
    "243": "The results demonstrate that SPD is a broad-spectrum antiseizure compound that blocks SE induced by pilocarpine and soman and affords in vivo neuroprotection that is associated with cognitive sparing. Its activity against SE is superior to that of diazepam in terms of rapid onset, potency, and its effect on animal mortality and functional improvement."
