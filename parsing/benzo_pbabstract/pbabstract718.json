    "0": "The effects of d-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide were studied in pigeons on performance (1) under a schedule that reinforced responses on a key (food key) if they were more than 20 sec apart, (2) under the same schedule when responses also were required on a collateral key during the interresponse time on the food key, and (3) under the same schedule when responses were required on a collateral key during the interresponse time on the food key and collateral-key responses could produce a stimulus correlated with the availability of food. Under all three spaced-responding schedules, d-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide at low dose levels slightly increased the frequency of short interresponse times on the food key for about half the birds, and either did not affect the interresponse time patterns of the other birds, or lengthened the durations slightly. At higher dose levels, d-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide increased the frequency of long interresponse times or abolished responding in all birds. Changes in the pattern of interresponse times on the food key did not seem to depend on changes in the rate or pattern of collateral-key responses.", 
    "1": "A case of retinitis pigmentosa with laughing epilepsy is described. Stereotyped repetitive episodes of limb movement, rigidity, and cackling laughter responding to diazepam are recorded. One episode is presented as gelastic status epilepticus and the clinical and EEG features are reported. Features of gelastic epilepsy are discussed and briefly compared with other laughing disorders. A short history of the condition is accompanied by a relevant review of the literature. The possible importance of hypothalamic lesions in laughing epilepsy is discussed and the absence of consistent EEG findings is noted.", 
    "2": "1. In the neuronally isolated cortex of the cat, local application of diphenhydramine, promethazine, gammahydroxybutyrate, gammabutyrolactone, gamma aminobutyric acid, hyoscine and pethidine, and the intravenous injection of diazepam and meprobamate depressed or abolished the surface negative and surface positive response to direct stimulation and raised the stimulus threshold of the positive burst response. These effects were the same as previously demonstrated for general and local anaesthetics on the same preparation.2. Chlorpromazine produced a similar depression in small concentrations but caused spontaneous activity in higher concentrations.3. In contrast to local application, pethidine when given by intravenous injection in a high dose produced convulsant activity in the isolated cortical slab. The possibility was suggested that the convulsant activity was produced by a metabolite of pethidine.4. The results of this investigation suggest that the central depression produced by a number of structurally unrelated drugs is indicative of an anaesthetic-like property of these drugs.", 
    "3": "In a preliminary controlled trial, CIBA 34,647-Ba, a gamma aminobutyric acid derivative, was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing spasticity due to spinal injuries. In an uncontrolled trial, 34,647-Ba also appeared more effective than diazepam. The intensity of spasticity was measured electromyographically by the amplitude of the stretch reflex at various velocities, and the results were correlated with those obtained by clinical assessment. 34,647-Ba was effective in both complete and incomplete spinal cord lesions and it is suggested that it has an action at the spinal level. No significant side-effects were encountered.", 
    "4": "1. When administered to intact white mice, the central depressants-diphenhydramine, promethazine, chlorpromazine, gammahydroxybutyrate, gammabutyrolactone, hyoscine, and pethidine-produced sedation in small doses, but excitement and convulsions in higher doses. When given to mice pretreated with subanaesthetic doses of phenobarbitone these drugs abolished the righting reflex both in convulsant doses (hyoscine excepted) and in non-convulsant doses. These effects are similar to the effects previously observed with local anaesthetics.2. Meprobamate, diazepam and chlorpromazine produced a loss of righting reflex both when given alone and following phenobarbitone. When given alone in higher doses, chlorpromazine induced convulsions.3. The central stimulants bemegride and picrotoxin antagonized the loss of righting reflex produced by phenobarbitone, but nikethamide, caffeine and strychnine did not alter the depressant effects of phenobarbitone.4. On the basis of these and previous studies with intact white mice a tentative classification of drugs having generalized depressant and stimulant effects on the central nervous system was proposed and discussed.", 
    "5": "Patients unable to submit themselves to routine dental treatment under local anaesthesia were studied during treatment under diazepam sedation accompanied by local anaesthesia, and compared with a matched control group for psychiatric assessment. Physiological responses, operating conditions, amnesia, pain threshold, and recovery were all assessed by various tests.Some of the patients had an anxiety neurosis, and several had been referred because of previous failure to complete dental treatment. Satisfactory conditions were obtained in all but two instances, and no adverse physiological responses occurred with diazepam in an intravenous dose of 0.2 mg./kg. Patients were clinically safe to leave accompanied by a responsible adult within one hour of administration of the drug. Some patients showed an improvement in attitude towards dentistry following treatment.", 
    "6": "The physiological responses to intravenous diazepam and oral local analgesia for conservative dentistry have been assessed in 16 patients. Apart from a transient tachycardia during actual administration of the drug, no clinically significant changes occurred in the haemodynamic, respiratory, or metabolic status of the patients. In some patients there was a period of incompetence of the laryngeal closure reflex."
