Recent studies have shown that treatment with Ro5-4864, a TSPO ligand, resulted in a neuroprotective effect in traumatic brain injury. Yet, the nature of this effect remained uncertain as mature neurons are considered to be lacking the TSPO protein. In order to investigate the mechanism of Ro5-4864-mediated neuroprotection, the neuro-inflammatory and neurosteroid response to cortical injury was tested in sham-operated, vehicle, cyclosporine A (CsA) and Ro5-4864-treated rats. As anticipated, the levels of interleukin 1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, as well as the astrocyte and microglia cellular density in the injured area were all decreased by CsA in comparison with the vehicle group. By contrast, no visible effect could be observed in Ro5-4864-treated animals. None of the groups showed any significant difference with any other in respect with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Double immunofluorescence staining with NeuN and TSPO confirmed the absence of TSPO in native neurons though showed clear evidence of co-localization of TSPO in the cytoplasm of NeuN-stained injured neurons. Altogether, this study shows that the neuronal protection mediated by Ro5-4864 in brain injury cannot be solely attributed to an indirect effect of the ligand on glial TSPO but may also represent the consequence of the modulation of upregulated TSPO in injured neurons. This observation may be of importance for future pharmacological research in neurotrauma.",

    "11": "sec-Butylpropylacetamide (SPD) is the amide derivative of valproic acid (VPA). SPD possess a wide-spectrum anticonvulsant profile better than that of VPA and blocks status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine and organophosphates. The activity of SPD on SE is better than that of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in terms of the ability to block SE when given 20-60 min after the beginning of a seizure. However, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration to rats cannot be extrapolated to humans. Consequently, in the current study a comparative pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic analysis of SPD was conducted following i.p., intramuscular (i.m.), and intravenous (i.v.) administrations to rats. SPD brain and plasma levels were quantified at various times after dosing following i.p. (60 mg/kg), i.v. (60 mg/kg), and i.m. administrations (120 mg/kg) to rats, and the major PK parameters of SPD were estimated. The antiseizure (SE) efficacies of SPD and its individual stereoisomers were assessed in the pilocarpine-induced BZD-resistant SE model following i.p. and i.m. administrations to rats at 30 min after seizure onset. The absolute bioavailabilities of SPD following i.p. and i.m. administrations were 76% (i.p.) and 96% (i.p.), and its clearance and half-life were 1.8-1.5 L h(-1) kg(-1) and 0.5-1.7 h, respectively. The SPD brain-to-plasma AUC ratios were 1.86 (i.v.), 2.31 (i.p.), and 0.77 (i.m.). Nevertheless, the ED50 values of SPD and its individual stereoisomers were almost identical in the rat pilocarpine-induced SE model following i.p. and i.m. administrations. In conclusion, in rats SPD is completely or almost completely absorbed after i.m. and i.p. administration and readily penetrates into the brain. Consequently, in spite of PK differences, the activities of SPD in the BZD-resistant SE model following i.m. and i.p. administrations are similar.",

To test the hypothesis that GABA A activation with the benzodiazepine alprazolam would blunt counterregulatory responses during subsequent exercise, 29 (15 male, 14 female) individuals with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 7.8 \u00b1 1%) were studied during separate 2-day protocols. Day 1 consisted of morning and afternoon 2-h euglycemic or 2.9 mmol/L hypoglycemic clamps with or without 1 mg alprazolam given 30 min before each clamp. Day 2 consisted of a 90-min euglycemic cycling exercise at 50% VO2max Tritiated glucose was used to measure glucose kinetics. Despite equivalent day 2 insulin (93 \u00b1 6 pmol/L) and glucose levels (5.3 \u00b1 0.1 mmol/L), plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone responses were similarly reduced after alprazolam or day 1 hypoglycemia compared with euglycemic control. Endogenous glucose production, lipolysis (glycerol, nonesterified fatty acid), and glycogenolysis (lactate) were also reduced during day 2 exercise after day 1 GABA A activation. We conclude that activation of GABA A receptors with alprazolam can result in widespread neuroendocrine, autonomic nervous system, and metabolic counterregulatory failure during subsequent submaximal exercise and may increase the risk of exercise-associated hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes.",

    "18": "As a result of its different forms and developments, catatonic syndrome can be associated with many organic and psychiatric etiologies and confused with a variety of diagnoses. In addition to its organic complications, malignant catatonia can also be extremely severe. Several diagnostic scales are described, those of Bush and Peralta being the most widely used. Despite the recent development of the DSM-5, we can regret the lack of progress in the international classifications concerning both the recognition of the etiological diversity of this syndrome and in the clinical and therapeutic approaches to it. The diagnosis is based solely on clinical data, and needs to be completed by information from paraclinical settings, particularly with respect to detecting organic etiology. The first-line treatment is still based on the use of certain benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents such as lorazepam, diazepam and zolpidem. If the first or second line fails, or in case of malignant catatonia, electroconvulsive therapy is recommended. For the periodic form, no large-sample study has been performed on long-term treatment. A few case reports suggest the use of lithium in periodic catatonia, specifically to prevent recurrent episodes or at least to extend the inter-episode intervals. Other studies are in favor of the use of benzodiazepines, with disagreement between gradual discontinuation and long-term treatment. Concerning the management of catatonia in patients with schizophrenia, for whom first-line benzodiazepines are often insufficient, certain atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine or quetiapine appear efficient. These data are also applicable to children and adolescents.",

However, despite the greater incidence of anxiety disorders in women, the data are still inconclusive regarding the mechanisms related to this phenomenon. We evaluated the effects of a classical anxiolytic/amnestic drug (diazepam; DZP) on female (at different estrous cycle phases) and male rats tested in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PMDAT), that allows the concomitant evaluation of memory and anxiety-like behavior. Further, in order to investigate the role of progesterone and its metabolites in the effects of DZP in the PMDAT, female rats were pre-treated with the progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone or the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride. The main findings were: (1) DZP caused memory impairment and anxiolysis in both sexes, but only the highest dose induced the anxiolytic effect in females; (2) females in proestrus did not present the amnestic and anxiolytic effects of DZP (at 2.0 and 4.0mg/kg, respectively) and (3) the co-administration of mifepristone reestablished both amnestic and anxiolytic effects of DZP, while finasteride reinstated the amnestic effect in proestrus female rats. These results suggest that changes in the endogenous levels of progesterone and its metabolites are important in the modulation of emotional/cognitive behavior in female rats. Based on the influence on different aspects of DZP action, the mechanisms related to this modulation are probably linked to GABAergic transmission, but this point remains to be investigated. Further, the variation in therapeutic and adverse effects of DZP depending on sex and hormonal state is of great relevance considering the higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in women.",

    "70": "Psychosis in epilepsy can be categorized in relation to seizures in two main categories: interictal psychosis and postictal psychosis. Postictal psychosis (PIP) is a specific syndrome in relation to seizure activity: a clear temporal relation exists between the psychotic state of sudden onset and a precipitating bout of complex partial or generalized seizures. However, this very specific syndrome is not included as such within the DSM-5, and PIP belongs to the category \"Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition\". Diagnostic criteria are: (1) episode of psychosis within 1\u00a0week after a seizure(s); (2) psychosis lasts more than 15hours and less than 2\u00a0months; (3) delusions, hallucinations in clear consciousness, bizarre, or disorganized behavior, formal thought disorder, or affective changes; and (4) no evidence AED toxicity, non-convulsive status epilepticus, recent head trauma, alcohol, or drug intoxication or withdrawal, prior chronic psychotic disorder. The presence of a lucid interval between the last seizure and start of changes rules out a simple postictal delirium. The outcome is characterized by a remission of the psychotic symptoms over several days (mean: 1\u00a0week), with or without any treatment. Prepsychotic EEG abnormalities persist during the psychosis. Risk factors for PIP include: long standing localization-related epilepsy, extratemporal onset, bilateral epileptiform activity, secondary generalization, slowing of the EEG background activity and personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. Brain MRI frequently shows structural abnormalities. Several functional neuroimaging studies have shown hyperperfusion in various cerebral regions during PIP, suggesting an excessive activation of particular structures of the brain rather than a postictal depression of cerebral activity. Implanted electrode studies have shown that the EEG correlate of psychotic symptoms differs from the ictal EEG correlate of epileptic seizures. The value of antipsychotic treatment in PIP requires further studies. Despite their role in symptomatic relief, there is no clear effect of neuroleptics on duration or prognosis of PIP. Different combinations of pharmaceutical interventions can be tried on a case by case basis: (1) oral administration of benzodiazepine; (2) combined oral administration of benzodiazepine and atypical neuroleptics; (3) intramuscular administration of dopamine-blockers for rapid tranquilization of violent or agitated patients. The notion that neuroleptic drugs lower the seizure threshold has no clinical significance: there is no evidence that antipsychotic drugs increase seizure frequency in epileptic patients treated with antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "71": "GABAA receptors are the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and are targets for numerous clinically important drugs such as benzodiazepines, anxiolytics and anesthetics. We previously identified novel ligands of the classical benzodiazepine binding pocket in \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA receptors using an experiment-guided virtual screening (EGVS) method. This screen also identified novel ligands for intramembrane low affinity diazepam site(s). In the current study we have further characterized compounds 31 and 132 identified with EGVS as well as 4-O-methylhonokiol. We investigated the site of action of these compounds in \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes using voltage-clamp electrophysiology combined with a benzodiazepine site antagonist and transmembrane domain mutations. All three compounds act mainly through the two \u03b2+/\u03b1- subunit transmembrane interfaces of the GABAA receptors. We then used concatenated receptors to dissect the involvement of individual \u03b2+/\u03b1- interfaces. We further demonstrated that these compounds have anesthetic activity in a small aquatic animal model, Xenopus laevis tadpoles. The newly identified compounds may serve as scaffolds for the development of novel anesthetics.", 
    "72": "Approximately 16-31% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have an alcohol use disorder and are at risk for developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Patients admitted to the ICU with AWS have an increased hospital and ICU length of stay, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, higher costs, and increased mortality compared with those admitted without an alcohol-related disorder. Despite the high prevalence of AWS among ICU patients, no guidelines for the recognition or management of AWS or delirium tremens in the critically ill currently exist, leading to tremendous variability in clinical practice. Goals of care should include immediate management of dehydration, nutritional deficits, and electrolyte derangements; relief of withdrawal symptoms; prevention of progression of symptoms; and treatment of comorbid illnesses. Symptom-triggered treatment of AWS with \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists is the cornerstone of therapy. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are most studied and are often the preferred first-line agents due to their efficacy and safety profile. However, controversy still exists as to who should receive treatment, how to administer BZDs, and which BZD to use. Although most patients with AWS respond to usual doses of BZDs, ICU clinicians are challenged with managing BZD-resistant patients. Recent literature has shown that using an early multimodal approach to managing BZD-resistant patients appears beneficial in rapidly improving symptoms. This review highlights the results of recent promising studies published between 2011 and 2015 evaluating adjunctive therapies for BZD-resistant alcohol withdrawal such as antiepileptics, baclofen, dexmedetomidine, ethanol, ketamine, phenobarbital, propofol, and ketamine. We provide guidance on the places in therapy for select agents for management of critically ill patients in the presence of AWS.",

The demographics of the groups were similar. The calculated dissection speed was significantly high in group G (36.02\u200a\u00b1\u200a20.96\u200amm/min) compared with group S (26.04\u200a\u00b1\u200a17.56\u200amm/min; P\u200a=\u200a0.010). The incidence of nausea, cough, number of oropharyngeal suctioning, and desaturation episodes were significantly high in group S compared with that in group G (P\u200a<\u200a0.5). While there was no difference between the groups in terms of hemodynamic parameters, in group S the use of propofol and in group G the use of midazolam and fentanyl were significantly higher (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Anesthesia time, postoperative anesthesia care unit, and hospital stay durations were not significantly different between the groups.General anesthesia increased dissection speed and enhanced endoscopist performance when compared with propofol-based sedation technique.",

Anxiety is associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress and contributes to the onset of disability. Mortality risks are also increased, through physical causes, especially cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in older adults remains a challenge because of the significant overlap in symptoms between physical disorders (shortness of breath; abdominal and chest pain; palpitations) and depression (disturbed sleep; poor attention, concentration and memory; restlessness). Good history taking is crucial in elucidating whether the complaint is of new onset or a recurrence of a previous disorder. The presence of comorbid depression should be clarified. If present, its temporal relationship with the anxiety symptoms will indicate whether there is an independent anxiety disorder. A medication review is warranted, as a number of drugs may be causative (calcium channel blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, digoxin, L-thyroxine, bronchodilators, steroids, theophylline, antihistamines) or may cause anxiety in withdrawal (e.g. benzodiazepines).

Our results indicated that the 1-(4-amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-ethylenedioxy-4h-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one, named 1g, exerted a significant growth inhibition of leukemia Jurkat T cells in a time and dose dependent manner, arresting the transition of G2/M phase through activation of Myt-1. The molecule also induced apoptosis through the enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic p53, and the inhibition of Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl, followed by the activation of caspase-3. The results suggested that compound 1g might act mostly as a cytostatic rather than cytotoxic compound. Although further studies are necessary, in order to identify others specific pathways involved in the activity of the present molecule, the presented results identified a novel molecule acting on specific G2/M checkpoint regulation pathway.

She had no complications during pregnancy and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery at term one week prior. On post-partum day five, she began complaining of headaches, initially responsive to ibuprofen but eventually worsened with no relief. On the evening of admission, her boyfriend noted strange behavior and movements consistent with a tonic-clonic seizure. On the way to the hospital, she had two more similar seizures witnessed by emergency medical serevices (EMS). EMS reported her blood pressures in route to be 200/100s. She was given 5 mg of magnesium by EMS due to concern for postpartum eclampsia. Upon arrival at the emergency room, she was somnolent but arousable although unable to answer any questions. She was mildly tachycardic at 106 beats per minute and had a temperature of 38.2\u00b0C. Her blood pressure was elevated at 165/95 mm Hg. On exam, dried blood was noted on her lips and her tongue was swollen. On auscultation, she was tachycardic with clear lung sounds. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender and there was no vaginal bleeding or other discharge.

To our knowledge, no case of 5-MAPB-related toxicity has been published in the scientific literature. We report a case of oral 5-MAPB exposure confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in a 24-year-old previously healthy white man. Observed symptoms and signs such as paleness, cold and clammy skin, hypertension, elevated high-sensitive troponin T level, tachycardia, ECG change, diaphoresis, mild hyperthermia, mydriasis, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, agitation, disorientation, hallucinations, convulsions, reduced level of consciousness, and creatine kinase level elevation (305 IU/L) were compatible with undesired effects related to 5-APB or MDMA exposure. Signs and symptoms resolved substantially within 14 hours with aggressive symptomatic treatment, including sedation with benzodiazepines, external cooling, analgesia and sedation with fentanyl-propofol, and treatment with urapidil, an \u03b1-receptor-blocking agent. 5-MAPB showed first-order elimination kinetics with a half-life of 6.5 hours, comparable to the half-life of MDMA.

    "181": "Needs for fast, yet reliable means of assessing the lipophilicities of diverse compounds resulted in the development of various in silico and chromatographic approaches that are faster, cheaper, and greener compared to the traditional shake-flask method. However, at present no accepted \"standard\" approach exists for their comparison and selection of the most appropriate one(s). This is of utmost importance when it comes to the development of new lipophilicity indices, or the assessment of the lipophilicity of newly synthesized compounds. In this study, 50 well-known, diverse compounds of significant pharmaceutical and environmental importance have been selected and examined. Octanol-water partition coefficients have been measured with the shake-flask method for most of them. Their retentions have been studied in typical reversed thin-layer chromatographic systems, involving the most frequently employed stationary phases (octadecyl- and cyano-modified silica), and acetonitrile and methanol as mobile phase constituents. Twelve computationally estimated logP-s and twenty chromatographic indices together with the shake-flask octanol-water partition coefficient have been investigated with classical chemometric approaches-such as principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), Pearson's and Spearman's correlation matrices, as well as novel non-parametric methods: sum of ranking differences (SRD) and generalized pairwise correlation method (GPCM). Novel SRD and GPCM methods have been introduced based on the Comparisons with One VAriable (lipophilicity metric) at a Time (COVAT). For the visualization of COVAT results, a heatmap format was introduced. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to reveal the dominant factors between computational logPs and various chromatographic measures. In consensus-based comparisons, the shake-flask method performed the best, closely followed by computational estimates, while the chromatographic estimates often overlap with in silico assessments, mostly with methods involving octadecyl-modified silica stationary phases. The ones that employ cyano-modified silica perform generally worse. The introduction of alternative coloring schemes for the covariance matrices and SRD/GPCM heatmaps enables the discovery of intrinsic relationships among lipophilicity scales and the selection of best/worst measures. Closest to the recommended logKOW values are ClogP and the first principal component scores obtained on octadecyl-silica stationary phase in combination with methanol-water mobile phase, while the usage of slopes derived from Soczewinski-Matyisik equation should be avoided.",

In vitro dissolution studies showed immediate drug release from all formulation when compared to the drug alone. The greatest increase in in vitro dissolution rate was observed in formulations containing P188 most likely due to its enhanced hydrophilic and surfactant properties compared to the other agents used.

However, the mechanism underlying the rapid development of hyperglycemia with the administration of olanzapine remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanism underlying olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of saline (control) or olanzapine 2.5, 5, or 10\u2009mg/kg. Blood samples were obtained periodically after olanzapine infusion to determine serum concentrations of glucose, olanzapine, and several endogenous substances. In a separate experiment, rats received an intravenous injection of propranolol (2\u2009mg/kg) 30\u2009min before infusion of olanzapine (10\u2009mg/kg). The intravenous infusion of olanzapine induced dose-dependent increases in the serum concentrations of glucose, epinephrine, and insulin. Pretreatment with propranolol suppressed olanzapine-induced elevations in the serum concentration of glucose, but did not affect the serum concentration of olanzapine or olanzapine-induced increase in the serum concentration of epinephrine. Although the serum concentration of corticosterone increased after administration of olanzapine, no significant differences were observed among the olanzapine dose groups. Furthermore, administration of olanzapine did not affect the serum concentration of glucagon or histamine. We developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model assuming that the olanzapine-induced secretion of epinephrine leads to elevated serum glucose concentrations. This model appeared to satisfactorily characterize olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia. In conclusion, a single intravenous dose of olanzapine dose-dependently increased the serum concentration of glucose in rats, and epinephrine plays a role in olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia.",

She showed dramatic paroxysmal sympathetic activity with dystonia. She was treated with wide variety of medications against PSH, which were found to be effective in previous studies. Among them, morphine, bromocriptine, propranolol, and clonidine were effective in reducing the frequency of her attacks while gabapentin, baclofen, dantrolene, and benzodiazepine were ineffective. Though the paroxysms decreased markedly after the treatment, they could not be completely controlled beyond 500 days. Following the treatment, levels of plasma catecholamines and their urinary metabolites decreased to normal during inter- paroxysms. However, once a paroxysm had recurred, these levels were again very high. This case study is considered significant for two rea- sons. One is that PSH among children have been rarely reported, and the other is that this case of prolonged PSH delineated the transition of plasma catecholamines during the treatment. The excitatory: inhibitory ratio (EIR) model proposed by Baguley was considered while dis- cussing drug sensitivity in this case. Accumulation of similar case studies will help establish more effective treatment strategies and elucidate the pathophysiology of PSH.", 
    "207": "Catamenial epilepsy is a type of refractory epilepsy characterized by seizure clusters around perimenstrual or periovulatory period. The pathophysiology of catamenial epilepsy still remains unclear, yet there are few animal models to study this gender-specific disorder. The pathophysiology of perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy involves the withdrawal of the progesterone-derived GABAergic neurosteroids due to the decline in progesterone level at the time of menstruation. These manifestations can be faithfully reproduced in rodents by specific neuroendocrine manipulations. Since mice and rats, like humans, have ovarian cycles with circulating hormones, they appear to be suitable animal models for studies of perimenstrual seizures. Recently, we created specific experimental models to mimic perimenstrual seizures. Studies in rat and mouse models of catamenial epilepsy show enhanced susceptibility to seizures or increased seizure exacerbations following neurosteroid withdrawal. During such a seizure exacerbation period, there is a striking decrease in the anticonvulsant effect of commonly prescribed antiepileptics, such as benzodiazepines, but an increase in the anticonvulsant potency of exogenous neurosteroids. We discovered an extrasynaptic molecular mechanism of catamenial epilepsy. In essence, extrasynaptic \u03b4GABA-A receptors are upregulated during perimenstrual-like neuroendocrine milieu. Consequently, there is enhanced antiseizure efficacy of neurosteroids in catamenial models because \u03b4GABA-A receptors confer neurosteroid sensitivity and greater seizure protection. Molecular mechanisms such as these offer a strong rationale for the clinical development of a neurosteroid replacement therapy for catamenial epilepsy.",

    "209": "Daily interruption of sedative therapy and limitation of deep sedation have been shown in several randomized trials to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay, and to improve the outcome of critically ill patients. However, patients with severe acute brain injury (ABI; including subjects with coma after traumatic brain injury, ischaemic/haemorrhagic stroke, cardiac arrest, status epilepticus) were excluded from these studies. Therefore, whether the new paradigm of minimal sedation can be translated to the neuro-ICU (NICU) is unclear. In patients with ABI, sedation has 'general' indications (control of anxiety, pain, discomfort, agitation, facilitation of mechanical ventilation) and 'neuro-specific' indications (reduction of cerebral metabolic demand, improved brain tolerance to ischaemia). Sedation also is an essential therapeutic component of intracranial pressure therapy, targeted temperature management and seizure control. Given the lack of large trials which have evaluated clinically relevant endpoints, sedative selection depends on the effect of each agent on cerebral and systemic haemodynamics. Titration and withdrawal of sedation in the NICU setting has to be balanced between the risk that interrupting sedation might exacerbate brain injury (e.g. intracranial pressure elevation) and the potential benefits of enhanced neurological function and reduced complications. In this review, we provide a concise summary of cerebral physiologic effects of sedatives and analgesics, the advantages/disadvantages of each agent, the comparative effects of standard sedatives (propofol and midazolam) and the emerging role of alternative drugs (ketamine). We suggest a pragmatic approach for the use of sedation-analgesia in the NICU, focusing on some practical aspects, including optimal titration and management of sedation withdrawal according to ABI severity.",

The absorption of midazolam nasally is influenced by the volume and concentration of midazolam, its physicochemical properties and the characteristics of the nasal mucosa. Delivering midazolam intranasally is non-titratable. The level of conscious sedation may be equivalent to that achieved by intravenous routes but is approached in a less controlled manner. Randomised Control trials using intranasal sedation in children have shown the technique to be safe and effective in secondary care for dental procedures at concentrations varying from 0.2 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg. A combined technique of intranasal midazolam (to facilitate cannulation) and intravenous midazolam is used for adults with moderate to severe learning disabilities. This has revolutionised dental treatment for this group of patients as treatment under General Anaesthesia (GA) may be avoided. Intranasal delivery of midazolam is emerging as a significant tool in our dental armamentarium for the treatment of anxious children, phobic adult patients and patients with learning disabilities.",

Oromucosal Midazolam sedation is a popular choice among paediatric dentists world wide due to its many advantages such as ease of administration, good efficacy, presence of reversal agents and a wide margin of safety. On the other hand, many investigators have reported that midazolam sedation may not be successful for carrying out all types of dental procedures. This may be attributed to diverse nature of various treatment plans coupled with the extent of behavioural changes in the child and operator's experience. Due to the heterogeneity involved in treatment of paediatric dental procedures, the specific indications for oral midazolam use that ensure its success rate, probably need to be defined.

The revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory provides a theoretical framework from which to understand the relevant underlying motivational processes. The current study aimed to identify the role of approach and avoidance motivational tendencies in the occurrence of benzodiazepine-related aggression. Data regarding benzodiazepine and other substance use, approach and avoidance motivation, and general and physical aggressive behaviour were collected via self-report questionnaires. Participants were a convenience sample (n=204) who reported using benzodiazepines in the previous year. Participants were primarily male (62.7%), aged 18-51 years old. Hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that general and physical aggression were predicted by alprazolam use and Drive, a facet of approach motivation. Overall, lower diazepam use significantly predicted higher levels of general aggression. However, when diazepam-preferring participants were examined in isolation of the larger sample (23.5% of sample), problematic (dependent) diazepam use was associated with greater aggression scores, as was dependence risk for alprazolam-preferring participants (39.7% of sample).

Regular and frequent use of triptans, like of any other symptomatic analgesic, can cause chronic headache and medication-overuse headache (MOH). In these circumstances, a detoxification treatment is necessary and therefore the monitoring and follow-up of the patients are crucial to the success of the treatment.

Hair samples were decontaminated, pulverized and incubated overnight in methanol; the extracts were then purified by a new and rapid QuEChERS procedure and analyzed by LC-MS/MS under gradient elution with positive ionization MRM mode. The procedure was fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, limit of detection and lower limit of quantitation, precision and accuracy, carry-over, matrix effect, recovery and dilution integrity. The validated procedure has been applied to 234 real hair samples collected from headache patients with known type and dosage of the taken drugs; the obtained data could be of interest to evaluate the xenobiotic concentrations in patients with known therapy.",

TSPO is found in the brain (where it is involved in neurosteroid synthesis), but is also expressed in the heart and other peripheral tissues. Oxazepam is potentially useful in the treatment of substance abuse, especially in conjunction with the cortisol synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, and can be considered an appropriate medication to use in the treatment of depression. The oxazepam/metyrapone combination has been piloted in cocaine-dependent patients and should be investigated in patients with depression. Expression of cardiac TSPO is altered by different stress conditions, and drugs binding to TSPO may have cardioprotective effects. The possibility of oxazepam, alone or together with antidepressant drugs, having a positive effect on cardiac function in patients with depression should also be studied.

By using a kainic acid-induced SE mice model, we tested whether pharmacological blockade or knock-out of interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) could influence the diazepam-refractory phenomenon of prolonged SE. We confirmed diazepam failed to terminate prolonged SE (allowed to continue for 40min before diazepam administration). The expression level of IL-1\u03b2 in the hippocampus during prolonged SE was significantly higher than that of baseline. Interestingly, prolonged SE was not diazepam-refractory in IL-1R1 knock-out mice. Moreover, administration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) combined with diazepam terminated established prolonged SE, while IL-1RA alone is not capable to terminate prolonged SE. On the contrary, administration of recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 weakens the efficacy of diazepam by prolonging its latency to terminate non-prolonged SE. Thus, the present study provides direct evidence that accumulated IL-1\u03b2 contributed to the diazepam refractoriness of prolonged SE, and suggests that interleukin-1 receptor is a target for adjunctive control of diazepam-refractory SE."
