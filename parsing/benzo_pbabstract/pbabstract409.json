Undernutrition of the dams was induced by restricting food intake to half, throughout the period of gestation, whereas chlordiazepoxide (2.5 mg/kg, ip) treatment was given from day 13 to 20 of gestation, this being the critical period for neural development in this species. The pups born were subjected to brightness discrimination learning, and retention of the learning acquisition after an interval of one week, in a single unit black/white T-maze, at 8-9 weeks of age. The results indicate that prenatal undernutrition induces significant learning and retention deficits in the offspring. Prenatally administered chlordiazepoxide induced significant deficits in learning acquisition and subsequent retention of the discrimination problem. Chlordiazepoxide induced similar learning and retention deficits in the normal and undernourished rats, and exaggerated the learning and retention deficits induced by undernutrition. The results indicated that the prenatal insults in the form of undernourishment and anxiolytic benzodiazepine compounds, leave a lasting imprint on cognitive behaviour of the offspring.", 
    "1": "One-day-old chicks were exposed to a one-time passive avoidance learning task. After chicks peak a bead dipped in a bitter-tasting liquid, they learn to stop pecking the bead. Radioligand binding analysis of [3H]flunitrazepam was performed on crude synaptosomal membranes from forebrains, at 10, 30, and 60 min post-training. Water-trained chicks (control) pecked a bead dipped in water, and they did not learn to stop pecking the bead. The water control was complemented with a methyl anthranilate fed control chick to demonstrate that taste per se does not affect the [3H]flunitrazepam binding. At 30 min in relation to 10 min post-training, the Bmax increased 31% in water-trained chicks and 56% in taste-trained chicks, with Bmax of the taste-trained chicks reaching a value 22% higher than that in water-trained chicks. The difference, attributable to the learning, disappeared at 60 min post-training, and at all times the affinity remained unchanged. The Bmax increase in water-trained chicks might be attributable to psychological stress accompanying the task and the Bmax increase in taste-trained chicks attributable to the learning in addition to the stress accompanying the task. The results suggest that the receptor increase associated with learning is involved in early stages of memory formation.",

    "4": "While unilateral electroconvulsive therapy (U-ECT) is generally considered to induce negligible disturbances of memory as compared with bilateral bitemporal ECT, its relative antidepressant efficacy has been questioned. The aim of the present study was to compare, in a double-blind design, clinicians' ratings of global clinical impression of the antidepressant efficacy of the two treatment modalities. The treatment technique included avoidance of benzodiazepines, prolonged hyperventilation with oxygen, intermittent unidirectional pulses distributed in a long pulse train, permitting individualized and relatively high doses of electrical charge at each treatment occasion, and non-dominant long-distance (12-13 cm) parietotemporal (d'Elia) electrode placement in the U-ECT group. The results indicated no therapeutic advantage for either treatment modality, which was also in accordance with the symptom ratings by an independent nonblinded rater. The findings encourage the continued use of nondominant long-distance parietotemporal ECT with a treatment technique that induces fully generalized seizures as the modality of choice in the convulsive treatment of depression.", 
    "5": "Recent studies have shown that 16 to 43% of general practice attenders express minor psychiatric disorders (Barrett et al. 1988). The present survey was carried out among a sample of 1,177 patients seen by 121 private general practitioners through out France. Its purpose was: to rate the point-prevalence of general anxiety disorders (GAD) according to DSM III criteria, to evaluate sociodemographic and clinical status of patients with a GAD, to identify the anxiety symptoms that were the most frequently exhibited in a primary-care practice. 181 patients (15.4%) were assessed a GAD diagnosis. 217 patients (18.4%) were assessed a \"secondary anxiety\" diagnosis ie anxiety associated with an affective disorder (14.8%), phobia (2.5%), panic disorder (1%). Patients with a GAD were predominantly female, between the age of 35-50 years. They tended to be widowed, separated or divorced and of an average socio-economic level. They also had more previous psychiatric disorders. The GAD appeared to start at the middle age of the life (36 years), to be chronic (lasting over one year) in half of the cases, and to be recurrent. The somatic expression of anxiety was frequent (21%) but 34% of the patients expressed directly their psychological distress. Psychotropic drugs were prescribed to 75% of the subjects. Benzodiazepines were prescribed in 34% of the cases. More surprisingly, antidepressive drugs were prescribed more often when a GAD was diagnosed. This results confirm the high point-prevalence rate of anxiety disorders in general practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The level of sedation before surgery and anesthetic requirements in the two groups were compared, as were systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate and hemodynamics during and after surgery. Fentanyl was used for anesthetic induction in boluses of 0.15 mg every 10 seconds; maintenance boluses of 0.5 mg were used up to a maximum dose of 0.07 mg/kg.

The number of patients requiring isoflurane was similar (4/11 and 6/9) in both groups. The hemodynamic profile prior to extracorporeal circulation (ECC) revealed arterial pressures and heart rates to be lower in the group treated with clonidine (p < 0.05); after ECC systemic resistance in group C was lower (630 +/- 103 vs 795 +/- 106 din.s.cm-5) (p < 0.05) and this was not compensated for by a significant rise in cardiac index (2.62 +/- 0.09 vs 2.40 +/- 0.08 l/min/m2) at similar occlusion pressures.",

    "16": "The binding of retinoic acid to serum albumin induces quenching of the protein fluorescence when it is excited at 280 nm, on the other hand the bound ligand acquires intrinsic fluorescence. Albumin has two kinds of binding sites for retinoic acid with an affinity constant of 10(5) M-1 and 10(4) M-1 respectively. The binding is entropically driven and produces a conformational change at the environment of the albumin tryptophan residues. This change was described by an equilibrium constant assuming two conformational states of the albumin tryptophan residues. Retinoic acid binds to the albumin fatty acid binding sites, producing a perturbation in the warfarin and benzodiazepine binding sites of this protein.", 
    "17": "In this study we measured the blood glucose before and after diagnostic upper GI endoscopy as an index of the stress induced by the procedure. The possible influence of various premedications in the blood glucose was also studied. One hundred and twenty consecutive non-diabetic patients of both sexes aged 20-75 years were randomly allocated into four groups (A,B,C,D) according to the premedication used. Sixty non-diabetic patients, who were not endoscoped, were allocated into three groups (C1, C2, C3) and served as controls. Blood glucose increased significantly in the patients but not in the controls. No correlation was found between the changes in the blood glucose and the time needed for the endoscopy. Changes in the blood glucose did not differ among the patients (F = 0.214; p = 0.886) irrespective of the premedication; however the increase was numerically less when 10% lidocaine spray was used as a premedication (Groups A and C). It is concluded that diagnostic upper GI endoscopy induced a significant increase in blood glucose, irrespective of the premedication. This increase seemed to be mainly the result of the stress induced by the irritation of the pharynx during the intubation.", 
    "18": "Exploratory behaviors as well as pharmacological actions of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptor agonists and inverse agonists were characterized in C57BL/6J and A/J strains of mice. C57BL/6J mice displayed higher levels of exploratory behavior than A/J mice in the light in equilibrium with dark exploration model of anxiety and in an open-field test, suggesting that C57BL/6J mice are less \"emotional\" and more active than A/J mice, respectively. However, C57BL/6J mice were more sensitive than A/J mice to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam in the light in equilibrium with dark exploration model. In contrast, A/J mice were more sensitive than C57BL/6J mice to the convulsant effects of methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. C57BL/6J mice showed no evidence of acquisition of a passive avoidance task, while A/J readily acquired this memory task at low levels of footshock. C57BL/6J and A/J mice should be useful parental strains in recombinant inbred lines for investigating the genetic determinants of benzodiazepine-sensitive behaviors and sensitivity to drugs acting on the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "19": "1. The effects of selective CCKB agonists, BC 264 and BC 197 were investigated in the conditioned suppression of motility test in mice, an animal model used to select antidepressant drugs. The results showed that both CCKB agonists at doses of 3 and 30 micrograms kg-1, accentuated the suppression of motility in shocked mice and did not modify the behaviour of non-shocked mice. The effects of BC 264 were suppressed by L-365,260. 2. L-365,260 alone, at doses of 0.2 and 2 mg kg-1 decreased motor inhibition in shocked mice and had no effect in non-shocked mice. 3. The effects of L-365,260 observed in shocked mice were suppressed by naltrindole, a selective antagonist for delta-opioid receptors, suggesting the occurrence of physiological adverse interactions between CCK and opioid systems. 4. Together, these results suggest that CCKB antagonists could block centrally located CCKB receptors to produce antidepressant-like effects which could indirectly involve delta-opioid receptor stimulation.", 
    "20": "Acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is a severe inflammatory disorder of the gallbladder. It occurs primarily in patients acutely ill from other disorders and is related to sepsis and shock. We previously found that platelet-activating factor (PAF), a phospholipid autacoid purported to be a mediator of the shock response, produced AAC. This study was performed to determine the effect of intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on feline gallbladders. Anesthetized cats underwent LPS administration with and without administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and PAF antagonist. Gallbladder inflammation was evaluated by quantitation of luminal water transport and tissue myeloperoxidase levels. In an attempt to understand the mechanisms of the response, gallbladder perfusate and tissue prostanoid and PAF levels were quantitated as were serum PAF levels. LPS administration resulted in alteration of the normal absorptive pattern of the gallbladder mucosa to exsorption of fluid into the gallbladder lumen, increased tissue myeloperoxidase levels and increased serum PAF levels. This was associated with increased gallbladder tissue and perfusate prostanoid levels and increased perfusate PAF levels. Indomethacin prevented the pro-inflammatory changes in the gallbladder produced by LPS. The PAF antagonist, alprazolam, increased gallbladder prostanoid production when administered alone and with LPS. The administration of LPS resulted in the production of acute changes in the gallbladder consistent with cholecystitis. These changes being prevented by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor suggests that development of AAC may be related to the release of systemic and local pro-inflammatory substances.", 
    "21": "T3 cellular uptake is inhibited in the presence of benzodiazepines (BZs). The structure-activity relationship of BZ inhibition correlates strongly with halogen substitution of the nonfused phenyl ring and indicates that this ring is required for activity. A structure-activity series of thyromimetic (TH) inhibitors of the HepG2 iodothyronine transporter further point out the critical importance of the amino group of the alanine side chain, its L-stereo configuration, and the size of the substituents of the inner and outer phenyl rings. A third series of compounds, reported to interact at related sites, were inactive as HepG2 iodothyronine transport inhibitors, and therefore the potent inhibitors were restricted to the BZ and TH compounds. Using both of these BZ and TH structure-activity series along with computer-assisted molecular modeling techniques, we determined which chemical structural components were important at the transporter interaction site. By superimposing structures from active chemicals, excluding residues from poor inhibitors, and incorporating molecular electropotential data, we developed a five-point model of BZ conformational similarity to the endogenous transporter ligand, L-T3: the alkyl substitution at the N1 of the BZ ring seems to simulate the alanine side chain of T3, and the electro-negative halogen and oxygen atoms of substituents at R3/R7/R2'/R4' of BZ form a pyramidal pharmacophore that seems to correspond with the 3-l/5-l/3'-l/4'-OH substituents of T3, respectively. These points, suggesting a tilted cross-bow formation, may be sites for ligand interaction with the iodothyronine transporter.",

By autoradiography, all of these drugs showed a specific distribution pattern of binding sites exclusively in brain areas which relate to the striato-pallido-nigral system, while no specific label was found in any other brain areas in the rat. Quantitative analyses of the autoradiograms by computerized densitometry, as well as by a receptor binding assay on 32 microdissected brain areas showed very high concentrations of tritiated homophthalazines in the glubus pallidus, caudate nucleus, putamen and the substantia nigra. Relatively high density of binding sites was measured in the nucleus accumbens, the olfactory tubercle, the entopeduncular nucleus and the subthalamic nucleus. Concentrations measured in the cerebral cortical areas, cerebellum or brainstem nuclei did not differ from the background. No significant differences were found between the homophthalazines investigated in terms of the distribution patterns or density of binding sites.", 
    "23": "The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of the non-M1 muscarinic receptors, in the extrinsic and intrinsic nerve control of in vivo colonic motility. Experiments were performed on the proximal colon of anaesthetized rabbits. In this species, the parasympathetic innervation of the proximal colon originates from the vagus nerves. The action of methoctramine and 4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) was studied on excitatory junction potentials (EJPs), and on inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) elicited in smooth muscle cells by stimulating parasympathetic efferents. The effects of the same drugs on spontaneous spiking activity were also investigated. The EJPs either decreased or disappeared after intra-arterial (i.a.) administration of 4-DAMP (45 pg to 450 ng). In the presence of 4-DAMP, further intravenous (i.v.) administration of pirenzepine (0.1 mg.kg-1) had facilitatory effects on the inhibitory pathway, i.e., after abolition of the EJPs, vagal stimulation elicited IJPs. With the highest dose of 4-DAMP, vagal stimulation immediately elicited IJPs the amplitude of which still increased after pirenzepine. In the presence of 4-DAMP, the spontaneous spike discharge was not noticeably altered. Methoctramine (0.37 to 75 micrograms, i.a. or 50 micrograms to 0.2 mg.kg-1, i.v.) increased the amplitude of the EJPs, whereas it decreased that of the IJPs. In addition, at the same doses, it either initiated or increased spike discharges that were not altered by pirenzepine up to 0.2 mg.kg-1, i.v. The so-called rebound excitation occurring after IJPs was not affected by methoctramine. No change in the EJP or IJP amplitude was observed with gallamine at sufficiently high doses to paralyse striated muscles (up to 3 mg.kg-1.h-1). It is concluded that the parasympathetic excitatory pathway to smooth muscle is blocked by 4-DAMP, whereas it is facilitated by methoctramine. 4-DAMP has no effect on the inhibitory pathway which is strongly depressed by methoctramine; however, the fact that these two drugs have opposite effects indicates that 4-DAMP and methoctramine may act on different muscarinic receptor subtypes. In addition, the facilitatory effects of pirenzepine on IJPs observed in animals pre-treated with 4-DAMP, indicates that the latter drug may act on non-M1 and non-M2 (presumably M3) muscarinic receptors. Methoctramine acts on non-M1 and non-M3 (presumably M2) receptors. The spike discharge induced by methoctramine is presumably due to an increased release of acetylcholine, and possibly also of a non-cholinergic transmitter which has excitatory effects on smooth muscle, the identification of which requires further investigations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "25": "Growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion has been described in diabetes mellitus and seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. As pirenzepine (PZ), a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, is able to inhibit GH hypersecretion in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), we investigated whether PZ is also able to inhibit spontaneous and stimulated GH-release in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Ten non-obese well-controlled patients with NIDDM underwent in random order the following three double-blind one week treatments: placebo (PL), PZ at low dose (PL in the morning plus PZ 50 mg at 22 h) or high dose (PZ 50 mg at 8 h plus 100 mg at 22 h). Pirenzepine administration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased nocturnal GH release after both low and high dose (AUC, PL vs PZ: 107.3 +/- 26.5 vs 48.3 +/- 10.5 and 57.6 +/- 9.6 micrograms/L/h, respectively). The GH response to arginine infusion was significantly inhibited by PZ at high dose (AUC, 147.1 +/- 48.8 vs 444.7 +/- 194.3 micrograms/L/h, p < 0.01), but not at low dose. Glucose, insulin, glucagon and somatostatin responses to arginine infusion were not changed by pirenzepine treatment. In conclusion, the muscarinic blockade by PZ is able to inhibit the spontaneous and stimulated GH secretion also in NIDDM without affecting insulin secretion.", 
    "26": "The effects of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), an alkylating agent producing irreversible blockade of various membrane bound receptors in brain, were investigated on four different types of serotonin receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3, in various brain regions in the rat. In addition, the fate of central benzodiazepine- and \"R\"-zacopride-specific binding sites was also examined in rats treated with EEDQ. Membrane binding assays and/or quantitative autoradiography with appropriate radioligands indicated that EEDQ inactivated 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A sites, but was poorly active on 5-HT3, benzodiazepine and \"R\" sites. Among the receptors affected by EEDQ, hippocampal 5-HT1A sites were the most sensitive to the alkylating agent (ID50 approximately 1 mg/kg i.p.), followed by the cortical 5-HT2A (ID50 approximately 3 mg/kg i.p.) and the striatal 5-HT1B (ID50 approximately 6 mg/kg i.p.) sites. Pretreatment by selective ligands partially protected hippocampal 5-HT1A sites from irreversible inactivation by EEDQ (10 mg/kg i.p.) with the following order of efficacy: WAY 100635 > spiperone > BMY 7378 > ipsapirone. Similarly, pretreatment by spiperone (5 mg/kg i.p.) also reduced the ability of EEDQ to inactivated cortical 5-HT2A receptors. Analyses of the time-course recovery of respective binding sites after EEDQ administration showed that the turnover rate of 5-HT1A sites did not significantly differ in the dorsal raphe nucleus and in various forebrain areas (hippocampus, septum, cerebral cortex; half-life: approximately 4 days), but was lower than that of cortical 5-HT2A sites (half-life: 2.9 days).",

This study confirms previous reports indicating increased sensitivity to CO2 in patients with panic disorder and that this sensitivity can be attenuated by treatment.

Patient discomfort during colonoscopy was assessed using visual analogue scales. All patients were allowed to stay for recovery as long as they wanted, and the time was measured. Modified recollection tests were performed prior to colonoscopy and when the patients left the Endoscopy Unit, in order to study the degree of mental impairment induced by the procedure and the medication. All patients had complete colonoscopies of the same duration in both groups. Discomfort during colonoscopy was rated the same in both groups (2p = 0.6413). Both groups of patients scored identically in the precolonoscopy recollection test. Most patients had a lower score after colonoscopy, but Entonox-treated patients scored significantly better than those with KHM (2p = 0.0250). Patients treated with Entonox opted to leave the Unit directly after the procedure (median 0 minutes; interquartile range 0-5 minutes) compared to 38 minutes for those with KHM (interquartile range 10-75 min), 2p < 0.001.

    "32": "The high rate of benzodiazepines (BZD) consumption has been repeatedly confirmed by epidemiological surveys in most major western world countries. In a recent french survey 7% of chronic users of BZD (use in 5/7 days for the last 12 months) were found the general population (17% in the population aged above 65). It has been suggested that the high BZD consumption rate could be related to dependence. The existence of BZD dependence was described in the early sixties with very high dose of chlordiazepoxide but it has become a real concern for the medical community since the late seventies with increasing number of reports of withdrawal symptoms. The extend of the actual rate of withdrawal symptoms at BZD tapering is still very controversial and according to the different studies it varies from 39 to 90%. The between studies difference in parameters such as: the patient populations (psychopathology, treatment duration), the type of tapering employed (duration, nature of the medical and psychological support) and the used operational criteria for withdrawal definition most likely explain this wide variation in the rate of occurrence of withdrawal manifestations. According to the American Psychiatric Association Task Force on Benzodiazepine Dependence, Toxicity and Abuse three type of pathological events can happen after treatment discontinuation: rebound, withdrawal syndrome and recurrence. The rebound consists in the early and transitory reappearance of the anxiety symptoms pre-existing to the treatment but in an exacerbated from; the withdrawal syndrome associates the resurgence of the pre-existing anxiety symptoms and new symptoms as sensory disturbances (metallic taste, hyperosmia, cutaneous exacerbated sensitivity, photophobia...) nausea, headache, motor disturbance in some rare cases depersonalization, paranoid reaction, confusion, convulsion. Rebound or withdrawal syndrome appearance delay varies from hours to few days according mostly to compounds elimination half-life. The relapse develops later with a progressive reapparance of pre-treatment symptoms. In practice recurrence and rebound are often difficult to isolate: recurrence can follow rebound. Different operational criteria of definition for this different entities have been proposed but there is a need for a consensual position. The treatment length, a high daily dose, an alcohol abuse history, a dependent personality and the severity of the psychopathology of the patients have been found to be predictive for the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms. Behavioural therapies (individual or in group) have been proposed with some success for the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence; drug treatment with carbamazepine or imipramine have demonstrated some efficacy. Other drug as buspirone clonidine having anxiolytic properties have not demonstrated efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "33": "According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R), drug-induced depression may be classified as an Organic Mood Syndrome, Depressed Type. Unfortunately, the DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently precise for application in research, and studies of drug-induced depression have rarely utilised these criteria. Research concerned with drug-induced depression is characterised by a number of methodological complications. These include differing definitions of depression, including depression defined as a symptom, a syndrome, or by diagnostic criteria for a specific mental disorder. In addition, patients undergoing pharmacological treatments for medical illnesses are typically exposed to considerable psychosocial stress due to the suffering and disability associated with illness. These psychosocial factors may in themselves precipitate episodes of depression. Due to these complicating factors, sophisticated study designs are required to confirm an aetiological role for medications as risk factors for depression. Unfortunately, adequate studies have rarely been conducted, and much of the literature consists of case reports and clinical observations. Consequently, clinicians are frequently required to make clinical judgements about the aetiology of patients' depressive symptoms in the absence of definitive scientific information about the role of drugs. Nevertheless, a knowledge of the relevant literature will assist clinicians in making reasoned judgements about the aetiology, prevention and management of these disorders.", 
    "34": "This study shows that diazepam (20 mg/Kg) and clonazepam (2 mg/Kg) administered intraperitoneally to 36 hour-fasted rabbits induce a significant (p < 0.05) hyperglycaemia 30 min. after administration. It also shows that the hyperglycaemic action of these benzodiazepines is significantly potentiated by nifedipine (10 mg/Kg) and inhibited by adenosine (1 mg/Kg), caffeine (40 mg/Kg) and propranolol (20 mg/Kg). The most pronounced inhibitory effect was that exerted by propranolol (p < 0.05). It is suggested that diazepam and clonazepam induced hyperglycaemia may be due to the release of hyperglycaemic hormones including adrenaline responsible for an increase of 3' 5' cAMP since the action of these benzodiazepines is inhibited by propranolol.", 
    "35": "Public concern about the prescription of hypnosedative drugs (mostly benzodiazepines) led to a controlled trial of an educational intervention to promote rational prescribing by general practitioners (GPs). This paper describes the educational intervention and its process evaluation. In urban and rural New South Wales 137 GPs were visited in office hours by a GP or pharmacist who had undergone communication skills training. Material offered to GPs included relaxation tapes and a booklet of problem-orientated management guidelines. The interview had three stages: rapport was established, then educational material was introduced and finally the visitor sought the doctor's agreement to review five patients on long-term benzodiazepines. The visits were well received. Several measures were composed to reflect doctors' motivation and interest in non-drug management; there was virtually no correlation between any of these process measures and the trial outcome: a change in prescribing behaviour. Self-rating of benzodiazepine prescribing greatly underestimated actual self-reported incidents of prescribing. We interpret this as a reminder that we do not always do what we mean to do, and that we do not always do what we think we do.", 
    "36": "We have recently developed a rat model of chronic pain states after spinal cord injury. Thus, after severe, but incomplete, ischemic spinal cord injury, some rats chronically exhibited responses indicative of pain to innocuous mechanical stimuli (allodynia) in the rostral dermatomes involving the injured spinal segments. These responses have some characteristics in common with chronic central pain in patients with spinal cord injury. We now report that systemic CI988, a specific antagonist of the cholecystokinin (CCK) type B receptor, effectively relieved the allodynia-like symptom, an effect that was reversed by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Furthermore, in rats which did not develop the allodynia-like symptom after spinal cord lesion, systemic naloxone induced typical allodynia. In contrast, naloxone failed to produce allodynia in normal animals. It is thus suggested that the abnormal sensory processing initiated by spinal cord ischemic lesion is under tonic opioidergic control and dysfunction of this control by the upregulated endogenous CCK system is responsible for the development of painful sensations in these rats.", 
    "37": "beta-Carboline abecarnil was behaviorally and biochemically characterized as a new anxiolytic agent in rodents and primates in comparison with the benzodiazepine (BZ) anxiolytics. Oral treatment with abecarnil (0.5-10 mg/kg) showed a potent anticonflict activity in the water-lick test in rats. The minimal effective dose was lower than those of BZ anxiolytics, such as etizolam, diazepam, clotiazepam and tofisopam. Abecarnil also showed taming effects to suppress fighting and aggressive behaviors in mice and monkeys with little sedative and ataxic effects, in contrast to the BZ anxiolytics producing marked sedative and ataxic effects. Furthermore, abecarnil suppressed both the sedative and ataxic effects induced by diazepam. Abecarnil bound to rat cerebellar BZ1 receptors (Ki = 0.24 nM) with higher affinity than to rat spinal cord BZ2 receptors (Ki = 1.3 nM), whereas BZ derivatives bound to both the receptors with a low and equal affinity. GABA-ratios of abecarnil were 1.9 for the BZ1 receptors and 2.8 for the BZ2 receptors, and they were smaller than those of diazepam and flunitrazepam. Thus, in contrast to the BZ derivatives, abecarnil may act as a selective partial agonist at central BZ1 receptors, resulting in its potent anticonflict and taming effects with little sedative and ataxic effects.", 
    "38": "1. The role of dopamine in the genesis of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)- and emotional stress (ES)-induced stimulation of colonic motility, as well as the mechanism of antagonistic action of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8s) and igmesine (alpha sigma receptor ligand, formerly JO 1784) on dopamine-induced colonic hypermotility, have been investigated in the rat. 2. ES and i.c.v. injection of CRF (0.5 microgram kg-1) increased the frequency of colonic spike bursts by 63% and 114%, respectively. Prior i.c.v. administration of (+)-SCH 23390 (a D1 receptor antagonist, 10 micrograms kg-1) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the CRF- and ES-induced increase in colonic spike burst; whereas, sulpiride (a D2 receptor antagonist, 10 micrograms kg-1) blocked the CRF-induced stimulation of colonic spike bursts but had no effect on the colonic response to stress. 3. I.c.v. injection of dopamine (100 micrograms kg-1), increased colonic spike burst frequency by 54%. (+)-SKF 38393 (5 micrograms kg-1), a selective D1 receptor agonist, and quinpirole (5 micrograms kg-1), a selective D2 receptor agonist, increased colonic spike burst frequency by 71% and 70% respectively. CCK-8s (0.1 microgram kg-1) and igmesine (0.1 microgram kg-1) injected i.c.v. completely prevented the stimulatory effects of dopamine, (+)-SKF 38393 and quinpirole. 4. Previous i.c.v. injection of devazepide, a CCKA receptor antagonist, (10 micrograms kg-1) antagonized the inhibitory effects of both CCK-8s and igmesine injected i.c.v. on dopamine-induced colonic hyperkinesia. 5. These results show that CRF stimulates colonic motility through activation of central dopaminergic mechanisms in response to stress; furthermore, CCK-8s inhibits dopamine-induced colonic hyperkinesia through a mechanism involving D1 and D2 receptors. The sigma receptor ligand igmesine, blocks the CRF and ES-induced colonic hyperactivity via an interaction with central CCK mechanisms.", 
    "39": "The possibility of physiologically-evoked muscarinic excitatory synaptic potentials was examined in the inferior mesenteric ganglion (IMG) with intracellular microelectrodes in vitro. Three types of depolarizing responses were evoked concurrently by colonic distension: (1) fast nicotinic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs); (2) an 'intermediate' time course depolarization and (3) a long time course potential that persisted throughout the period of distension. After hexamethonium was superfused over the ganglia the long time course potential was observed in 91% of IMG neurons. Intermediate time course of depolarizations were observed in 100% of IMG neurons and correlated with each propulsive contraction of the distal colon. The intermediate depolarizations had an average amplitude of 1.8 +/- 0.1 mV (n = 175 individual events; 27 preparations) with an average duration of 11.9 +/- 0.8 sec (n = 28 individual events). The intermediate time course synaptic potentials were accompanied by an increase in input resistance of 15% (n = 6). Superfusion of atropine (1 microM; n = 6) on the IMG or the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine (1 microM; n = 5) abolished the intermediate time course synaptic potentials during distension. Superfusion of the M2-selective antagonist AF-DX 116 (1 microM; n = 4) had no effect. In all preparations examined, distension-induced intermediate time course depolarizations were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) (3 microM). Pressure ejection of carbachol (1 mM, 60-100 ms pulses) evoked depolarizations of similar amplitude (6.5 +/- 0.7 mV; n = 18) and duration to the intermediate depolarizations observed during propulsive contractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "We studied the efficacy of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CGP 40116 in protecting against seizure-induced neuronal necrosis from lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Rats were given CGP 40116 either before SE (12 mg/kg i.p.) or 15 min after the onset of SE (4, 12 and 24 mg/kg); controls received normal saline 15 min after SE began. Diazepam and phenobarbital were given i.p. after 3 h of SE to stop the seizures. Rats were killed 24 h later, and their brains were processed for light microscopic examination. Neuronal damage occurred in 24 of 25 brain regions examined in saline-injected animals. Protection was maximal in rats given 12 and 24 mg/kg CGP 40116 after SE onset: 19 and 21 of the 24 damaged regions were protected respectively, but the 24 mg/kg group had a mortality rate comparable to saline-injected controls. No necrotic neurons were found in posterior cingulate and retrosplenial neurons at the two highest CGP 40116 doses, suggesting that the transient cytoplasmic vacuolization induced by NMDA receptor antagonists does not progress to frank necrosis. In rats given CGP 40116 seizure discharges were not eliminated, but their amplitudes were significantly reduced 2 h after SE began. The periodic epileptiform discharge (PED) EEG pattern, probably a sign of widespread neuronal damage, developed in saline-injected controls after 2-2.5 h of SE but not in rats given 12 and 24 mg/kg of CGP 40116. CGP 40116 provided widespread protection against seizure-induced neuronal necrosis, suggesting that an essential step in its production is NMDA receptor activation by endogenous glutamate. The neuroprotection provided was not simply an antiepileptic effect, since electrographic seizures persisted despite NMDA receptor blockade. CGP 40116 and NMDA receptor antagonists in general could be useful as adjunctive neuroprotectants in patients with refractory SE.", 
    "41": "A method for measuring behavioral responses of rats to both anxiolytic and anxiogenic manipulations, the open field drink test (OFDT), is described. This method utilizes the concept that in the open field, appetitive behavior is reduced because of the ambient level of fear experienced in such an environment. For the OFDT, rats were given restricted access to water for 1 h per day for 3 days, and then their behavior was assessed in an open field that contained a water spout at its center. Use of the open field permitted a number of measures to be taken; of these, \"time spent drinking\" was most sensitive in detecting differences. Three experiments showed that the OFDT: a) permitted dissociation between behavioral responses to an anxiolytic (diazepam) and an anxiogenic (FG7142) drug, b) detected a dose-response relationship for an anxiolytic drug (diazepam), and c) detected behavioral responses to environmental manipulations designed to increase fear (presence of an olfactory cue from rats that had received foot shock). Advantages of this test over previously described methods are outlined, and several guidelines are provided to aid investigators in using this behavioral test.", 
    "42": "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS) are neurosteroids that have been shown to interact with the GABA system. The present study examined the effects of these compounds in mice on motor activity and behavior in the elevated plus maze. Doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above of DHEA reduced motor activity. This effect was blocked by diazepam, RO15-1788, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), and ethanol. Both DHEA and DHEAS showed anxiolytic activity in the plus maze test, with DHEA being effective over a very wide range of doses (5 micrograms/kg to 1.0 mg/kg). Both RO15-1788 and PTZ blocked the anxiolytic effect of DHEA, there was no interaction with diazepam, and ethanol enhanced the anxiolytic effect of DHEA. At 1.0 mg/kg, DHEAS blocked the anxiolytic effect of ethanol. These results support the hypothesis that neurosteroids could be involved in the termination of a stress response.", 
    "43": "Testing the injectable dosage form of phenazepam showed no substantial pharmacokinetic differences in epileptic patients receiving a single intravenous and intramuscular doses of 2 mg. The bioavailability of the drug was 0.82. The individual and mean experimental stationary phenazepam concentration (157.3 ng/ml) in the patients' blood during course intramuscular therapy was found to be close to the theoretical stationary one (150.6 ng/ml). The pharmacokinetic findings allow one to optimize phenazepam therapy for epileptic patients.", 
    "44": "The newly synthesized compound, 1-amino-5-bromouracil (ABU, CAS 127984-93-4), showed unique anxiolytic activity in rats and mice. Its minimum effective dose was 10 mg/kg p.o. in the Geller type conflict test in rats, and it showed anxiolytic activity at a dose of 20 mg/kg i.p. in the Vogel type conflict test in mice. ABU also induced loss of the righting reflex in mice. The ED50, a dose level that induces loss of the righting reflex in 50% of mice, was 86.4 mg/kg p.o. On the other hand, ABU showed only weak activities both potentiating the drug-induced anesthesia and myorelaxing in comparison with diazepam. Furthermore ABU did not show an affinity for benzodiazepine receptor. Thus, the pharmacological profile of ABU is concluded to be different from that of diazepam.",

    "47": "U-67413B (4-hydroxydipropylaminodihydrophenalene) bound with high affinity to both 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)1A and D2-dopamine (DA) receptor sites. U-67413B depressed 5-HT and DA cell firing rates and depressed synthesis of both neurotransmitters. The drug depressed mouse body temperatures by an amount similar to that for buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone, but less than that for 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin. In rats, it produced the 5-HT1A behavioral syndrome. In contrast to 5-HT1A agonists having DA antagonist effects, U-67413B mildly depressed rather than stimulated firing rates of noradrenaline (NA) neurons in the locus ceruleus by a non-alpha-2 receptor mechanism. In behavioral tests designed to measure anxiolytic activities, U-67413B was a slightly more effective anxiolytic than standard 5-HT1A anxiolytics (buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone). The data are consistent with the hypothesis that effects of 5-HT1A agonists on NA neuron activity are mediated through effects on dopaminergic mechanisms, and that effects on NA neurons could modulate anxiolytic activities of 5-HT1A agonists.", 
    "48": "To elucidate the neurochemical mechanism of epilepsy, we investigated the role of neurotransmitter systems in the animal models of epilepsy, the mechanism of anticonvulsants and proconvulsants, the neurotransmitters in the CSF of children with epilepsy, and the new therapy for epilepsy. The main results are as follows. 1) In El mice, the increased activity of excitatory amino acids system in cortex and decreased activity of noradrenergic system in striatum and hippocampus were related to the increased seizure susceptibility. 2) GABA sensitivity was reduced in young DBA 2 J mice which are susceptible to audiogenic seizures. 3) Lower benzodiazepine receptor densities were found in hippocampus of 4 and 16 weeks-old tremor rats. GABA concentrations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the tremor rats increased at 5 weeks-old and decreased at 15 weeks-old. These changes may be related to the absence-like seizures in tremor rats. 4) Anticonvulsant mechanism of ACTH may be due to antagonizing glutamate binding. Proconvulsant mechanism of thyroid hormone may be related to the decrease in number of cerebral cortical neuronal benzodiazepine receptors. Penicillin acts its proconvulsant effect through inhibiting GABA-gated chloride ion influx. 5) CSF GABA level in children with infantile spasms was lower than in controls. The combination of vitamin B6 and valproic acid is effective and safe therapy in the treatment of infantile spasms. Further investigations by the neurochemical approaches are necessary to understand the mechanisms of epilepsy and develop the new therapy.", 
    "49": "Anxiety and depression frequently coexist in the same patient. The physician should rule out secondary causes of the symptoms, assign a diagnostic category if possible and assess the relative severity and chronicity of primary symptoms and associated complaints. Supportive counseling is always indicated for these patients, and pharmacotherapy is often helpful as well. A number of therapeutic agents, including tricyclic antidepressants, azapirones and benzodiazepines, have been shown to be useful either alone or in combination. Careful monitoring of all symptoms and prudent adjustment of the medication regimen is imperative to ensure adequate resolution of symptoms.", 
    "50": "The incidence and nature of cardiac dysrhythmias occurring during intravenous sedation with lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam for oral surgery were studied. Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I patients of both sexes between the ages 17 and 32 years were randomly allocated to three groups. Groups received either intravenous lorazepam (.05 mg/kg), diazepam (.25 mg/kg), or midazolam (.1 mg/kg) prior to the oral surgical procedure. Electrocardiograms were made before medication and thereafter throughout the entire procedure. Of the 60 patients studied, 16 (26.7%) exhibited dysrhythmias during the surgical procedure. If sinus dysrhythmias were excluded as a cause of abnormal rhythms, only six patients (10%) exhibited dysrhythmias during surgery. No atrial or ventricular premature beats were recorded for the lorazepam group. In the diazepam group five of the patients (25%) exhibited dysrhythmias; 15% were mainly unifocal ventricular premature beats. Only one patient in the midazolam group exhibited unifocal ventricular premature beats.", 
    "51": "In free-moving male rats, the function relating frequency to the threshold current required to drive hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA) with septal stimulation has a minimum at 130 ms. Both classical anxiolytics (e.g. benzodiazepines) and the novel anxiolytic buspirone show similar effects on septal driving of RSA. The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine may be as effective as anxiolytic drugs in treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. The antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine has also been reported to be effective in treating anxiety, but this may reflect an action on \"atypical depression\" rather than \"anxiety\". The present study therefore compared the effects of acute administration of imipramine and phenelzine on septal driving of RSA to determine whether either would mimic anxiolytics in this test. Rats were chronically implanted with septal stimulating electrodes and subicular recording electrodes. Three groups of rats received IP injection of either imipramine (5.9-13.3 mg/kg or 13.3-30 mg/kg) or phenelzine (0.2-5.4 mg/kg). The effects produced by imipramine were very similar to the effects produced by anxiolytic drugs. In contrast, the effects produced by phenelzine were essentially opposite to those of both anxiolytic drugs and imipramine. The present experiment suggests that imipramine may act as a true anxiolytic, in addition to its conventional antidepressant properties. In contrast, phenelzine may be effective in cases where the etiology is essentially that of depression even when the symptomatology appears to be that of anxiety.", 
    "52": "The neuropeptide cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide (CCK-4) has potent anxiogenic action in human and animal subjects. On the basis of prior work which demonstrated that benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor agonists antagonized CCK-induced excitation of rat hippocampal neurons we studied whether BZD receptors mediated the anxiogenic effect of CCK-4. To examine this possibility we determined whether the BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil could antagonize the effects of CCK-4 (50 micrograms) in healthy volunteers. Thirty subjects (10 females; 20 males) were pretreated with flumazenil (2 mg in saline) or placebo (0.9% NaCl in water) 15 min prior to CCK-4 challenge in a randomized double-blind crossover design. Flumazenil had no impact on the behavioral and cardiovascular effects of CCK-4, suggesting that BZD receptors do not mediate the anxiogenic action of CCK-4. The influence of GABA and non-GABA-related mechanisms on response to CCK-4 remains to be considered.", 
    "53": "Eight volunteers with histories of drug abuse participated in two experiments examining the modulation of drug choice by behavioral requirements following drug ingestion. Each morning subjects ingested color-coded capsules containing triazolam (0.25 mg), d-amphetamine (15 mg), or placebo and then engaged in a relaxation or a computer vigilance activity. Experiment 1 involved two phases (i.e. a triazolam and a d-amphetamine phase), presented in counterbalanced order. Within each phase, subjects were first exposed to each of two compounds (placebo and either triazolam or d-amphetamine) once with each activity. Then every other day for 20 days subjects chose which compound they ingested with the vigilance and relaxation activities, with the restriction that they could not choose the same compound with both activities. Seven of eight subjects reliably chose d-amphetamine with the vigilance activity; all subjects always chose triazolam with the relaxation activity. In experiment 2 (5 days' duration), after re-exposure to the color-coded compounds used in experiment 1, subjects chose which compound (placebo, d-amphetamine or triazolam) they ingested with the vigilance activity, and on another occasion (in counterbalanced order), which they ingested with relaxation activity. Seven of eight subjects chose d-amphetamine with the vigilance activity; all subjects chose triazolam with the relaxation activity. The relaxation and vigilance activities modulated triazolam and d-amphetamine reinforcement, thereby demonstrating a new class of environmental variable that can influence drug self-administration.", 
    "54": "The effect of triazolam (0.25 mg) and placebo was investigated in healthy, male subjects who slept in a sitting position. After the intake of placebo, sleep efficiency, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and subjective sleep quality were lower than in the preceding sleep episode in bed, while stage 1 and REM sleep latency were higher. Triazolam did not prevent this impairment of sleep. However, in comparison with the placebo condition, the percentage of slow wave sleep was higher in the first third of the night, and in the morning sleep was rated as more quite. EEG power density in nonREM sleep was reduced in the frequency range of 1.25-10.0 Hz and enhanced in the range of sleep spindles (12.25-13.0 Hz). These changes were still present in the last third of the night. In REM sleep, triazolam reduced spectral activity in some frequency bins between 4.25 and 10.0 Hz. The sitting position itself affected the nonREM sleep spectra, since the placebo level in the 2.25-21.0-Hz range exceeded the baseline level. We conclude that a 0.25 mg dose of triazolam does not effectively counteract a posture-induced sleep disturbance, but induces changes in the EEG spectra which are typical for benzodiazepine receptor agonists.", 
    "55": "This study compared the effects of the beta-carboline anxiolytic, abecarnil, with other benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands, including the full agonists diazepam and alprazolam, and the partial agonists ZK 95962 and bretazenil (Ro 16-6028), and alpidem, in the mouse four-plate test and plus-maze. The efficacy and potency of each compound was related to the fraction of BZR occupied by the drug. Abecarnil was efficacious in both tests and showed anxiolytic effects comparable with alprazolam and diazepam. In the four-plate test, abecarnil, bretazenil, and ZK 95962 had selective effects on releasing exploratory locomotor activity suppressed by footshock (punished crossings). None of these compounds significantly altered non-punished crossings. In contrast, diazepam and alprazolam increased both unpunished and punished crossings at low to medium doses (receptor occupancies of approximately 20-60%). The number of punished and unpunished crossings fell to control levels or below at higher, more sedative doses (approximately 80% receptor occupancy). Alpidem had very weak anxiolytic-like effects in this test and markedly reduced unpunished crossings at relatively low receptor occupancies (> 15%). In the plus-maze, abecarnil increased the time spent in the open arms and the percentage open arm entries to an extent equal to that observed following diazepam or alprazolam administration. Bretazenil and ZK 95962 had weak effects on the measures of anxiolytic activity in this test. Alpidem also had little anxiolytic-like activity in the plus-maze but markedly reduced the total number of arm entries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The consequences of sleep deprivation on vigilance and mood were evaluated in six healthy medical students the day after being on night duty and the following day, after recovering from a full night's sleep. Diurnal vigilance was studied using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and mood was assessed on an anxiety self-evaluation scale. The study was conducted by means of a double-blind randomized trial to measure the effects of benzodiazepine (lormetazepam, 2 mg) compared to a placebo administered before the night recovery/full night's sleep. Sleep deprivation induced a significant decrease in vigilance the day following the night duty. Sleep latencies were shortened during the morning following the night of recovery/full night's sleep. The values obtained after administering the lormetazepam did not differ significantly from those obtained after administering the placebo. There were no considerable differences in the anxiety evaluation scores before and after the night of recovery/full night's sleep between the two sequences of the trial. This study suggests that a significant lack of sleep (a 36-hour sleep deficit) modifies diurnal vigilance over two nyctohemeral periods. Administration of benzodiazepine with a short half-life after occasional sleep deprivation does not change the reorganization of the sleep-waking cycle.",

    "61": "The elevated plus maze is a well-established model of anxiety, with previous results showing that guinea-pigs handled daily from birth exhibit behaviour in this test similar to rats. In the present microdialysis study exposure of the guinea-pig to the elevated plus maze increased extracellular 5-HT in the lateral prefrontal cortex. The CCK-B receptor agonist BOC-CCK-4 (10 micrograms/kg) produced 'anxious' behaviour and potentiated the rise in 5-HT observed on exposure to the X-maze. The basal release of cortical extracellular 5-HT was not affected by BOC-CCK-4. Pretreatment with the selective CCK-B antagonist L 365.260 (100 micrograms/kg) antagonized both the 'anxious' behaviour and the neurochemical changes induced by BOC-CCK-4 while L 365.260 alone produced 'anxiolytic' behaviour, decreased basal extracellular 5-HT and prevented the increase in extracellular 5-HT seen when the guinea-pigs were exposed to the X-maze. Our results show that CCK-B receptor stimulation and blockade induce changes in central extracellular 5-HT levels associated with 'anxious' and 'anxiolytic' behaviour, respectively.",

    "63": "Exocrine pancreatic function was studied in control rats and animals subjected to treatment with hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg/day) over 7 days. In both cases, the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist L-364,718 (0.1 mg/kg/day) had been administered. The administration of this nonpeptide CCK antagonist significantly reduced the basal pancreatic flow of secretion and enzymes in the control rats but did not cause a decrease in pancreatic weight. From this it may be inferred that factors other than CCK are able to exert the trophic effects of this hormone. Also, the processes of enzyme synthesis and storage, which contribute to maintaining the weight of the organ, continued to occur under conditions of deprivation of the action of endogenous CCK because pancreatic secretion in response to the infusion of CCK was similar in the animals treated and not treated with L-364,718. In contrast, no significant changes were observed either regarding pancreatic weight or basal pancreatic secretion in the animals treated with hydrocortisone and simultaneously with L-364,718, as compared with the rats treated only with hydrocortisone. This points to a predominant effect of glucocorticoids on the action of CCK during the phases of enzyme synthesis and storage, accompanied by a blockade of exocytosis due to hydrocortisone treatment. The secretagogue effect of CCK alone becomes possible with high levels of this hormone of exogenous origin, whose interaction with its specific receptors is in turn positively modulated by an excess of glucocorticoids.",

In Expt. 1, an already established cytoprotective dose of Na(+)-NBQX (30 mg/kg i.p. x 3) was compared with saline (1 ml), the NMDA antagonist MK-801 (1 mg/kg i.p. x 3), and a combination of the same doses of both NBQX and MK-801. Initial doses were delayed to 90 min following occlusion with subsequent injections at the time of reperfusion and 30 min following reperfusion. Saline-treated rats sustained 181 +/- 32 mm3 (n = 15) of neocortical infarction (mean +/- SD). This was significantly reduced by NBQX to 137 +/- 25 mm3 (n = 15, p < 0.05) of damage. Neither MK-801 (170 +/- 33 mm3; n = 11) nor the combination of MK-801 and NBQX (169 +/- 20 mm3; n = 6) proved to be cytoprotective when given with a 90-min delay. In Expt. 2, NBQX (30 mg/kg) was dissolved (6 mg/ml) in 5% dextrose and compared with both saline and dextrose (1.2 ml) i.v. infusions given over a 4-h period starting 1 h after occlusion. Saline-treated rats had a mean infarct of 183 +/- 27 mm3 (n = 6), dextrose-treated had 200 +/- 30 mm3 (n = 9), while for NBQX-treated rats it was reduced to 129 +/- 60 mm3 (n = 10, p < 0.05). Intravenous NBQX precipitated into the renal tubules, causing nephrotoxicity.

Many of the older compounds produce residual effects the next morning, such as impaired performance, lack of concentration and day-time sedation. This \"hangover\" phenomena will only serve to make the problem worse rather than better. The patient's quality of life would suffer, and this is particularly apparent in older patients. Zopiclone and zolpidem, two novel compounds, are superior to the older benzodiazepines in that they do not impair performance on tests of cognition, reaction time and memory the day following drug ingestion.

    "67": "In conscious female Wistar rats with chronic lateral cerebroventricular cannula, the thermoregulatory effects of CCK-8, ceruletide and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) were studied. In addition, the possible involvement of type A or type B receptors of CCK-8 in thermoregulatory effects of PGE1 and CCK-8 was also investigated. In the normothermic rat an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of CCK-8 or ceruletide induced a thermogenic response with tail-skin vasoconstriction and a resulting rise in colonic temperature (Tc). There was a significant negative correlation between the starting level of Tc and the extent of rise in Tc following an i.c.v. administration of PGE1, CCK-8 or ceruletide. Subcutaneously injected CCK-8 caused decreases in Tc in a cool ambient temperature as also described by others. The fever-like response to i.c.v. injected CCK-8 was attenuated by a CCK type B receptor blocker, but not by a CCK type A receptor blocker. Conversely, the hypothermic response to peripherally administered CCK-8 was attenuated by a type A receptor blocker, but not by a type B receptor blocker. Neither of these CCK-receptor blockers influenced the fever caused by an i.c.v. injection of PGE1. It is concluded that in normothermic rats the thermogenic response observed after i.c.v. injection of CCK-8 and ceruletide is the most likely central thermoregulatory change mediated by CCK type B receptors, while the well-known hypothermic response observed after peripheral injection of these peptides might also be explained by their direct effect on variables influencing some of the thermoregulatory effector mechanisms at the periphery.", 
    "68": "Microinfusions of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic (midazolam) into the septum or the amygdala suppressed different fear reactions in two tests of rat \"anxiety\". Septal infusions increased open-arm activity in the plus-maze test and decreased burying behavior in the shock-probe test whereas amygdaloid infusions produced neither of these antianxiety effects. Amygdaloid infusions, however, dramatically impaired shock-probe avoidance, an antianxiety effect not produced by the septal infusions. Infusions of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) blocked each of these specific, anti-fear effects of midazolam without producing intrinsic effects by itself. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptor systems within the amygdala and the septum differentially mediate specific fear reactions.", 
    "69": "It has been proposed that the positive reinforcing and motor stimulating effects of drugs involve the activation of a common neural substrate. Reinforcing effects of food, drugs and brain stimulation are blocked by lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), which is a component of the mesencephalic locomotor region. This has suggested that the PPTg may be involved in both positive reinforcement and forward locomotion. In four separate experiments, rats were prepared with NMDA (0.5 microliters of 0.1 M solution) or sham lesions of the PPTg. Animals in the first two experiments were tested for the development of a conditioned place preference (CPP) to morphine (2 mg/kg x 3 pairings) or amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg x 3 pairings). Ten days later, spontaneous motor activity (SMA) was assessed in these animals following a subcutaneous injection of saline or amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg). In two further experiments, drug-naive lesioned and control animals were tested for SMA only (saline or 1.5 mg/kg amphetamine in Experiment 3, and saline, 0.5 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg amphetamine in Experiment 4). Lesions of the PPTg blocked the development of a CPP to both morphine and amphetamine. In contrast, lesions had no effect on saline or amphetamine-stimulated SMA. The PPTg, therefore, appears to be involved in the reinforcing effects of amphetamine and morphine, but is not necessary for the expression of amphetamine-induced activity.", 
    "70": "The GABAergic and dopaminergic pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in the control of emotions and in the adaptive responses to stressful stimuli. The present study was aimed at characterizing a range of biochemical markers of GABA- and dopamine-mediated neurotransmission in the CNS of Roman high-avoidance (RHA/Verh) and Roman low-avoidance (RLA/Verh) rats, two psychogenetically selected lines that differ in their level of emotionality. The stimulatory effect of GABA on 36Cl- uptake was less pronounced in the cerebral cortex of RLA/Verh rats as compared to RHA/Verh rats, whereas no line-related changes were detected in [3H]GABA and [3H]flunitrazepam binding. On the other hand, the density of D1 dopamine receptors labeled with [3H]SCH 23390 was lower in the nucleus accumbens of RLA/Verh rats as compared to their RHA/Verh counterparts, whilst no line-dependent changes were observed in the binding parameters of D1 dopamine receptors in the striatum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These biochemical differences may contribute to the distinct emotionality and responsiveness to the effects of psychoactive drugs of RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rats.", 
    "71": "Since the discovery of endogenous ligands for opiate receptors, endorphins and enkephalins some 30 years have elapsed. The fact that one of the breakdown products of the common precursor (proopiomelanocortin, POMC) ACTH and opioid peptides, i.e. ACTH 1-24 has a saluretic effect (balancing perhaps sodium retention after activation of the adrenal cortex) was not generally accepted yet although MSH as well as some fragments of the ACTH molecule have a natriuretic effect. The endogenous digitalis-like immunoreactive factor, DLF (even ACTH displays some DLF activities) which inhibits NaK-ATPase originates from the adrenals and is probably identical with ouabain, although I have doubts on conclusive evidence. The physiological function of DLF is not known either. Endogenous benzodiazepines (\"endozepins\") probably play a part in the modulation of cerebral activity: their excess may be associated with a nosological entity, idiopathic recurrent stupor. Nitric oxide, a mediator of vasorelaxing reactions, caused by acetylcholine, has already penetrated into general clinical thinking. There are at least ten diseases where NO plays a part. It is not only an endogenous factor which imitates more perfectly the action of organic nitrates but also a nervous mediator and it shares this function with another gaseous mini-hormone, carbon monoxide (CO). Endogenous ligands of drug receptors comprise also endogenous substances which interreact with receptors for calcium inhibitors (inhibitors of calcium channels). Here are important clinical perspectives not only in cardiology. There are moreover endogenous ligands for receptors for marihuana (tetrahydrocannabinols) in particular a derivative of arachidonic acid anandamide (substance of \"inner bliss\").(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The M3-specific antagonists hexahydrosila-difenidol and its p-fluoro analog showed no effect on pilocarpine-induced seizures. The M2-specific antagonists gallamine and methoctramine cause seizures in mice in the absence of a pilocarpine injection. These seizures could be inhibited by coinjection of methoctramine with the M1-specific antagonist, pirenzepine. These data suggest a role of muscarinic M1 receptors in mediating pilocarpine-induced seizures and a role of the muscarinic M2 receptors in modulating neuronal activity.", 
    "74": "The possible changes in nociception at various stages of male sexual behaviour were explored in the hot plate test. Although other authors have reported an antinociceptive effect of mating, we failed to find this effect on the hot plate test after several sexual behaviour events. To further explore the possible antinociceptive action of copulation we administered a suboptimal analgesic dose of morphine (0.3 mg/kg i.p.). No change in nociception were observed in animals treated with a subthreshold dose of morphine and tested in the nociception test after ejaculation were observed. Since previous reports have refered that ejaculation produces hypoalgesia when measured in the hot plate test, we attempted to replicate these findings. We found that one ejaculation produces an increase in the latency to escape in male rats previously habituated to the hot plate test. These results suggest a hypoalgesic effect. However, such changes could also be interpreted as alterations in the animals' emotionality. Thus, a group of habituated animals was tested on the switched off plate. An important increase in the escape latency behaviour after ejaculation was observed, while no differences between control animals, without sexual behaviour display, tested on switched on and switched off plate were observed. The participation of the benzodiazepine and opiod systems in the ejaculation effect on the switched off plate was explored. A similar increase in escape latency to that induced by ejaculation was caused by diazepam (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg). The increase in escape latency induced by ejaculation was prevented by the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (20.0 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) responses were investigated in PC12 cells using the conventional whole-cell and nystatin perforated patch techniques. With the nystatin perforated patch, ACh induced three kinds of ionic currents: a rapid transient inward current, a subsequent transient outward current and a long-lasting slow inward current, whereas only a transient inward current was recorded by conventional whole-cell patch. The transient rapid inward current was mimicked by nicotine, but not by muscarine. On the contrary, the transient outward current and the long-lasting slow inward current were mimicked by muscarine but not by nicotine. Both nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists inhibited the transient inward current and the subsequent outward current in a concentration-dependent manner. The current-voltage relationship for the nicotine-induced transient current showed an inward rectification and the reversal potential was close to the Na+ equilibrium potential. The ACh-, muscarine-, CCh- and oxotremorine-M induced outward currents increased in a sigmoidal fashion with an increase in the concentration. Neither McN-A-343, an M1 agonist, nor oxotremorine, an M2 agonist, mimicked the muscarinic response. The reversal potential of the muscarinic response was close to the K+ equilibrium potential. The muscarinic response was not affected by pre-treatment with pertussis toxin but was enhanced by pre-treatment with Li+. In the cells perfused with Ca(2+)-free external solution, only the first application of ACh induced the muscarinic response. Calmodulin antagonists reversibly blocked the muscarinic response in a concentration-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Injections with the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam (Tz), 6 h before activity onset (CT6) produce large phase advances of the circadian pacemaker in hamsters. An increase in locomotor activity and/or the state of arousal is considered essential for the effects of Tz, suggesting the potential involvement of central monoaminergic systems in this process. The present study examines the effect of reserpine-induced monoamine depletion on the phase-shifting effects of Tz in hamsters. Wheel running activity of 16 male golden hamsters (14 weeks old) was continuously monitored in constant darkness. After a stable free-running circadian rhythm was established half of the animals received reserpine (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and the other half vehicle treatment. Ten days later all animals were given Tz injections (10 mg/kg i.p.) at CT6 and the circadian activity rhythm was monitored for 2 more weeks. An additional 10 animals were used to determine the effect of reserpine on the central monamine levels using high pressure liquid chromatography. A circadian rhythm of locomotor activity with reduced amplitude and longer free-running period persisted after reserpine treatment, despite the significant monoamine depletion. Triazolam injections at CT6 induced large phase-advances (93.1 +/- 14.9) in the control group that were markedly attenuated in 7 out of the 8 reserpine-treated animals (3.12 +/- 17.7 min, P < 0.01).

Attenuation of the pressor action by the two drugs was more marked in the WKY than in the SHR. Based on the fact that both drugs act via the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, the data support the suggestions (i) that a central GABAergic system regulates blood pressure, (ii) that there is probable dysfunction of the GABA receptors in SHR.",

The compound showed a high affinity for 5-HT1A specific binding sites in the rat hippocampus (IC50 3 nM), moderate affinity (10(-7)-10(-6) M) for dopamine D2 receptor, 5-HT uptake, 5-HT2 and alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites and practically no effect on binding sites of monoamine, GABAA, benzodiazepine and histamine receptors. It inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal membranes at concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) M. The effect of 10(-6) M SR 57746A on forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was completely antagonized by 10(-6) M (-)-propranolol.

AMPA, applied in different concentrations (30-1000 microM) did not evoke any current. Kainate evoked an increase of steady-state current (KA-current). NMDA induced a current with 5-10 times higher peak amplitude than KA, but GYKI 52466 failed to affect this current. It reduced the amplitude of KA-current in a concentration-dependent (1-100 microM) manner, and produced a slow decay of it. The IC50 value of GYKI 52466 against 100 microM KA was 20.4 +/- 6.4 microM with a Hill coefficient of 1.12. The inhibition of KA-currents was voltage-dependent with greater inhibition between -110 to -40 mV than between -30 and +60 mV. In order to compare the effect of GYKI 52466 with a well-known competitive non-NMDA antagonist, we also studied the effect of the quinoxalinedione CNQX.

Treatment was administered at signs or 2 min after agent challenge and consisted of oxime (100 mumol/kg) + atropine (13 mg/kg) (alone or together with diazepam). Twenty-four-h LD50 values were calculated for soman- and tabun-intoxicated animals, whereas 24-h survival was noted in animals given 10 LD50s of sarin or VX. In pyridostigmine and control rabbits intoxicated with soman and treated with oxime + atropine (alone or together with diazepam), HI6 was 3-5 times more effective than 2-PAM. In contrast, HI6 was less effective than 2-PAM against tabun poisoning. In pyridostigmine-pretreated animals exposed to tabun, efficacy was increased more than 3-fold when compare to tabun-challenged animals treated with atropine + HI6 alone. Both oximes were highly effective against sarin and VX. These findings suggest that HI6 could replace 2-PAM as therapy for nerve agent poisoning, because it is superior to 2-PAM against soman, and when used in pyridostigmine-pretreated animals, it affords excellent protection against all four nerve agents when used in combination with atropine (alone or together with diazepam) therapy.",

The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (DZ), and the inverse agonist, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor single channel currents were characterized. Outside-out patches were obtained from somata of cultured mouse spinal cord neurones and voltage clamped at -75 mV (ECl = 0 mV). 2. GABA (2 microM) alone or with DZ (20-1000 nM) or DMCM (20-100 nM) was applied to patches by pressure ejection from blunt micropipettes. DZ enhanced GABAA receptor currents with an inverted U-shaped concentration-response curve. Mean steady-state currents were increased by low concentrations of DZ (20-50 nM). At higher concentrations of DZ, the enhancement was diminished. Mean steady-state currents were decreased by DMCM at all concentrations. 3. GABAA receptor channels opened most frequently to a 27 pS main conductance level and less frequently to a 19 pS subconductance level. Neither DZ nor DMCM altered the proportion of time spent at either of the conductance levels. The kinetic properties of the main conductance level were studied. 4. Neither DZ nor DMCM altered the mean GABAA receptor channel open or burst durations. Sums of three exponential functions were required to fit best open and burst duration-frequency histograms for GABA alone or with DZ or DMCM. No significant changes in the three time constants or areas of the three exponential functions for open or burst duration histograms were produced by DZ or DMCM. 5. With increasing concentrations of DZ up to 50 nM, GABA evoked an increased frequency of channel openings and bursts. With higher DZ concentrations, the magnitudes of the increase in channel opening and burst frequencies were reduced. At all concentrations of DMCM, GABA evoked a decreased frequency of channel openings and bursts. 6. Closed duration-frequency histograms for GABA alone or with DZ or DMCM were best fitted by sums of at least six exponential functions. The three shortest closed duration time constants were unchanged by DZ or DMCM. The three longest closed duration time constants were altered by DZ and DMCM, consistent with alterations in opening frequency. 7. DZ increased and DMCM decreased steady-state GABAA receptor current by increasing or decreasing channel opening frequency without altering mean channel open duration. We propose that DZ and DMCM alter GABAA receptor current by acting reciprocally to increase or decrease only, respectively, the apparent agonist association rate at the first of two proposed GABA binding steps without altering channel gating.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Treatment with the CCKB receptor agonist CCK tetrapeptide (CCK4, 0.01-10 microM) exacerbated the ischemia-induced decrease in the CA1 presynaptic potential in a concentration-dependent manner. Whereas, treatment with the CCKB receptor antagonist [(3R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepin-3-yl)-N1-(3-methylphenyl)-urea] (L365260), and not with CCKA receptor antagonist [(3S(-)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepin-3-yl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamide] (L364718), produced a concentration-dependent attenuation of the ischemia-induced decrease. The magnitude of recovery of the CA1 field potentials in L365260-treated groups at 10 and 100 nM was 34% and 45%, respectively. The neuroprotective effect of L365260 (0.01 and 0.1 microM) was completely blocked by co-treatment with CCK4 (0.1 microM), a concentration that did not affect the decreased presynaptic potential induced by ischemia. These results demonstrated that the stimulation of the CCKB receptor played a detrimental role in the development of ischemic damage, whereas the blockade of CCKB receptors played a neuroprotective role in ischemic damage, suggesting a facilitatory role of CCK receptor-operated function in ischemia-induced neuronal deficits.",

During kindling development, when the animals displayed afterdischarges lasting more than 30 s but no seizures, a significant increase in Ach levels (+66%) was observed after electrical stimulation. Ach levels were also elevated after a stage 5 kindled seizure (+48%), with no additional increment compared to rats experiencing only afterdischarges. Chronic diazepam administration prevented kindling development and the increment in Ach overflow; however, diazepam itself (following acute administration) tended to decrease Ach levels in the amygdala. These findings are convergent with pharmacological data suggesting that changes in the cholinergic function may be important especially during amygdaloid kindling development.",

The effect of a TIBO derivative ((+)-S-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-9-chloro-5- methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-imidazol[4,5,1-jk]1,4-benzodiazapine -2-thione ) on the DNA strand transfer reaction catalyzed by HIV-1 RT (which is a function of both the DNA polymerase and RNase H activities) was investigated by delineating the effect of the drug on the constitutive DNA polymerase and RNase H activities) was investigated by delineating the effect of the drug on the constitutive DNA polymerase and RNase H activities. Single nucleotide incorporation on template-primer 1 was used to study the DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT while template-primer 2 was used to study the effect of TIBO on the RNase H activity (polymerase independent). The drug was found to decrease the amplitude of the presteady-state burst when preequilibrated with the enzyme-substrate complex besides decreasing the steady-state rate of single nucleotide incorporations. In the absence of preincubation, TIBO did not affect the burst amplitude but decreased the steady-state rate after the pre-transient phase. This suggested that binding of TIBO to RT was affected by the presence of template-primer and required dissociation of the enzyme from the template-primer for effective binding. The polymerase-independent RNase H activity was activated in the presence of TIBO. The effect of TIBO on the overall process of DNA strand transfer is a balance between its inhibition of the polymerase activity and its activation of the RNase H activity.", 
    "93": "The National Institute of Forensic Toxicology has registered a large increase in the number of samples from drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs other than alcohol. Illegal and prescribed drugs are detected in an increasing number of cases. In many of these cases, the drugs are combined with alcohol. The most frequent drugs detected in 1992 in addition to alcohol were tetrahydrocannabinol (the psychoactive compound in cannabis) and benzodiazepines, mostly detected at blood concentrations above therapeutic levels. Simultaneous use of different benzodiazepines and use of benzodiazepines in combination with illegal drugs are common. The number of samples containing amphetamine showed a significant increase in 1992 compared with 1991 (an increase of 80%).", 
    "94": "Acyl glucuronide conjugates are chemically reactive metabolites which can undergo hydrolysis, rearrangement (isomerization via acyl migration) and covalent binding reactions with protein. The present study was undertaken to identify factors modulating the reactivity of diflunisal acyl glucuronide (DAG) with human serum albumin (HSA) in vitro, by comprehensively evaluating the interplay of the three pathways above when DAG and a mixture of its 2-, 3- and 4-isomers (iso-DAG) were incubated with protein. Buffer, plasma, fraction V HSA, fatty acid-free HSA, globulin-free HSA and fatty acid- and globulin-free HSA were investigated at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees, each in the absence and presence of warfarin, diazepam and diflunisal (DF) as reversible binding competitors. DAG and iso-DAG were highly reversibly bound (ca. 98-99.5%) in plasma and HSA solutions. The binding was primarily at the benzodiazepine site, since displacement occurred in the presence of diazepam and fatty acids but not warfarin. DAG degradation, via rearrangement, hydrolysis and covalent adduct formation (in that order of quantitative importance), was retarded in plasma and HSA solutions compared to buffer. The protective effect of protein was afforded by the high reversible binding to the (non-catalytic) benzodiazepine site. The warfarin site appeared to be catalytic for DAG hydrolysis, whereas rearrangement appeared to be hydroxide ion-catalysed only. In contrast to DAG, iso-DAG degradation was greatly accelerated in the presence of protein, through both covalent binding and catalysis of hydrolysis. Covalent binding via DAG was increased in the presence of warfarin but decreased in the presence of diazepam, DF and fatty acids. The opposite effects were found for covalent binding via iso-DAG. The data suggest that covalent binding of DF to HSA via DAG and iso-DAG occurs by different mechanisms (presumably transacylation and glycation, respectively) at different sites (benzodiazepine and warfarin, respectively) whereas reversible binding occurs primarily at the same site (benzodiazepine).", 
    "95": "Astrocytes cultured from spinal cord contain two morphologically distinguishable types of astrocytes: fibrous and protoplasmic cells. Both astrocyte subtypes, in culture, are able to express GABAA receptors, and their activation results in inward currents at the resting potential. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology we characterized their basic receptor pharmacology and compared it to spinal cord neurons that were also present in small numbers in these cultures. As in neuronal GABAA receptors, the local anesthetic pentobarbital effectively potentiated GABA-induced currents in both astrocyte subtypes. Similarly, the benzodiazepine diazepam, on average doubled GABA-induced currents in both astrocytes subtypes. In contrast to these effects that were similar in both astrocytes types and similar to spinal cord neurons, the response to the convulsant methyl-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), which is an inverse benzodiazepine agonist differs between astrocyte subtypes. DMCM reduced GABA-induced currents by about 50% in fibrous astrocytes as we also observed with spinal cord neurons. In contrast, DMCM increased GABA currents in protoplasmic astrocytes by up to 150%, an effect never observed in neurons. DMCM potentiations of GABA currents have recently been attributed to differences in receptor subunit composition. Our results thus indicate that subtypes of astrocytes express GABAA receptors that differ pharmacologically and likely differ also in subunit composition.", 
    "96": "Changes induced in the sleep-wake cycle by pontine microinjections of muscarinic antagonists were studied in freely moving rats, instrumented for chronic polygraphic recordings. Pirenzepine (PIR), methoctramine (MET) and p-fluoro-hexahydro-siladifenidol (p-F-HHSiD), which are highly selective M1, M2 and M3 antagonists, respectively, were dissolved in 0.1 microliter of sterile isotonic saline (0.2 microliter of distilled water for p-F-HHSiD) and injected into the pontine reticular nucleus, where the administration of 0.5 microgram carbachol (a mixed muscarinic agonist) induced a 52% increase in the amount of desynchronized sleep (DS) over a 6 h recording period. The blockade of M2 receptors was shown to (i) antagonize DS, by increasing its latency and decreasing its percentage, (ii) decrease slow wave sleep, and (iii) enhance wakefulness. These effects were dose-dependent. No changes in the sleep-wake cycle were observed following microinjection of M1 or M3 antagonists. The results support the hypothesis that at the brain stem level only M2 receptors are involved in sleep mechanisms and, particularly, in the generation and maintenance of DS.", 
    "97": "This report describes the purification and characterization from rat brain of DBI39-75, a novel, biologically active processing product of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI). We have shown that DBI39-75 in nM concentrations stimulates pregnenolone synthesis in mitochondria of rat brain. Using cross-linking of 125I-DBI39-75 in steroidogenically active concentrations we have demonstrated for the first time that the DBI fragment has a specific high affinity binding site in rat brain. Displacement of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro5-4864 by DBI39-75 indicates more complex interaction than the competitive inhibition. Collectively, the data suggest that the function of DBI39-75 is mediated through a mitochondrial receptor complex which includes binding sites for PK 11195 and Ro5-4864.", 
    "98": "The efficacy of two 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists in drug-naive and benzodiazepine-experienced rats was compared in two animal tests of anxiety, the social interaction and elevated plus-maze tests. Benzodiazepine-experienced rats were tested 48h after the last of 28 daily injections of diazepam (2mg/kg/day), a time at which there was no anxiogenic withdrawal response. S20499 (0.04, 0.2 and 1mg/kg) ((+)-8(4-[N-(5-methoxychroman-3yl)N-propylamine]butyl)-8-azaspirol[4,5]decane-7,9-dione) and buspirone (0.2mg/kg) significantly increased social investigation, indicating anxiolytic-like actions, and there was no significant modification in these effects as a result of the previous diazepam treatment. Both drugs also significantly reduced aggressive behaviours in both drug-naive and diazepam-experienced rats. An anxiolytic-like action in the elevated plus-maze was also indicated for S 20499 (0.04 and 0.2mg/kg) by an increase in the percentage of time spent on the open arms; this effect was not significantly changed by prior diazepam experience. Buspirone (0.2mg/kg) had no significant effects on the plus-maze. The results provide no evidence for reduced efficacy of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists in animal tests of anxiety as a result of prior diazepam treatment.", 
    "99": "In the framework of the well-known regulatory role of the GABA-benzodiazepine (BZ) mechanisms of the brain in response to social and environmental challenges, we tested the hypothesis that developmental manipulation of this neurochemical system by prenatal BZ exposure can affect the social repertoire and neophobia level in infant mice. Outbred CD-1 mice were treated with either vehicle or oxazepam (15mg/kg p.o. to the dam, twice a day on Days 12-16 of foetal life), and fostered at birth to untreated dams. Two males plus two females were observed in the home cage, in the presence of a novel object, on Postnatal Days 16, 20 and 24. The expression of social and non-social behaviours increased with age. Prenatal oxazepam exposure reduced sex differences by having a more pronounced effect on males than on females; it also produced fairly specific, though subtle, behavioural changes. Oxazepam exposed mice appeared more involved than prenatal controls in behaviours related to the achievement and maintenance of a \"passive\" proximity with littermates. By contrast, they performed less active investigation and solicitation of littermates, and non-social behaviours such as locomotor-rotational play, cage exploration, and maintenance activities; they also showed a reduced frequency of approaching and making contact with the novel object. Analysis of social interactions of infant mice seems to represent a sensitive tool for early detection of subtle developmental changes in the CNS.", 
    "100": "The effects of several drugs acting at central benzodiazepine receptors on performance of a differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) 15s schedule of reinforcement for food reward were studied in rats. The non-selective full agonists diazepam (0.1, 1.25, 5 and 10mg/kg) and lorazepam (0.1, 0.25, 0.375 and 0.5mg/kg) increased total numbers of responses and decreased the numbers of reinforcements received, increased burst responding (responding within 3s of a previous response), and produced a shift in the interresponse time (IRT) distribution of responses towards shorter intervals. The beta-carboline anxiolytic abecarnil (0.039, 0.156, 0.313 and 0.625mg/kg) was more potent than the two benzodiazepines, but otherwise gave rise to similar changes in performance. Bretazenil (0.1, 1.0, 10 and 30mg/kg), a non-selective partial agonist, and CL 218872 (3, 10, and 30mg/kg), a partial agonist showing preference for the BZ1 receptor subtype, also increased response rates and decreased numbers of reinforcements, but failed to increase significantly burst responding, and had only weak effects in shifting the IRT distribution. Alpidem (1, 3, 10, 30 and 100mg/kg) and zolpidem (0.33, 1, 3 and 10mg/kg), two imidazopyridines showing BZ1 preference, but classified respectively as an anxiolytic and a selective hypnotic agent, non-significantly reduced response rates and significantly reduced the numbers of reinforcements, but did not influence burst responding, and had effects on IRT distribution only at single doses. Thus, in general, the effects of these compounds on DRL performance reflect their activity in conflict models. The differential effects on DRL performance of the benzodiazepine receptor ligands tested may be attributable to their abilities to interact selectively as agonists or partial agonists at different benzodiazepine receptor subtypes.", 
    "101": "The hypnotic effects of propofol, midazolam, alfentanil, and their binary and triple combinations, were studied in 130 unpremedicated patients in a randomized, double-blind fashion. The ability to open eyes on verbal command was used as an end-point. Dose-response curves for the three drugs given separately and in combination were determined with a probit procedure and the ED50 values were compared with an isobolographic analysis. The ratios of a single-drug fractional dose (ED50 = 1.0) to a combined fractional dose (in fractions of single-drug ED50 values) indicating the degree of superadditivity (synergism) were: 1.4 (P < 0.05) for propofol-alfentanil, 1.8 (P < 0.0005) for midazolam-propofol, 2.8 (P < 0.0001) for midazolam-alfentanil, and 2.6 (P < 0.0001) for propofol-midazolam-alfentanil. The results indicate that the propofol-midazolam-alfentanil interaction produces a profound hypnotic synergism which is not significantly different from that of the binary midazolam-alfentanil combination.", 
    "102": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome may be just an annoyance to an affected person's bed partner, or it can be a more serious and even dangerous condition for the person involved. One clue to the condition is daytime somnolence, although not all sleepy patients have the syndrome. If obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is confirmed by a polysomnogram, a trial of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is warranted. If daytime somnolence is unaffected, then it is unlikely that the syndrome is the sole cause of the patient's sleepiness. Alternative diagnoses (eg, narcolepsy, atypical depression) should then be considered. Surgery, orthodontic devices, and pharmacotherapy are generally less effective than NCPAP and are usually reserved for patients who cannot tolerate NCPAP. Surgical techniques may be best suited for patients who have clearly defined craniofacial abnormalities and those who cannot tolerate NCPAP. Weight reduction to near ideal body weight and avoidance of benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol should be emphasized in all patients with suspected or confirmed sleep apnea.", 
    "103": "In a cross-sectional investigation of the properties of DSM-III-R panic disorder (PD), panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA), and agoraphobia without history of panic disorder (AWOPD), we analyzed demographic, descriptive, comorbidity, treatment, and course data for 562 subjects with PD, PDA, or AWOPD in a multicenter anxiety-disorders study. In general, AWOPD subjects had the worst functioning and PD subjects the best, as measured by length of intake episodes, education attained, likelihood of receiving financial assistance, depressive comorbidity, and likelihood of having experienced 8 weeks symptom-free. Panic disorder with agoraphobia was the most common disorder and emerged as a condition intermediate in severity between the other two. Treatments received varied little by diagnosis. Most subjects received medication, usually benzodiazepines. Psychodynamic psychotherapy was the most frequently received psychosocial treatment; cognitive and behavioral approaches were less common. Subjects classified with AWOPD were the most likely to have received exposure therapies.", 
    "104": "Gastrin (cholecystokinin type B (CCK-B)) receptor antagonists may help to elucidate the physiological role of gastrin, have therapeutic potential as acid antisecretory drugs, and may be of use as adjuvant therapy for gastrin sensitive tumours. In binding studies, the gastrin receptor antagonist PD-136,450 had at least 1000 fold greater affinity for gastrin (CCK-B) than CCK-A receptors. In this study the biological activity of PD-136,450 was evaluated in conscious and anaesthetised rats. PD-136,450 antagonised gastrin stimulated acid secretion after subcutaneous (IC50: 0.28 mumol/kg; conscious rats) and intravenous (IC50: 0.17 mumol/kg; anaesthetised rats) administration. In basal secreting fistula animals, the compound stimulated acid output to 30 (5)% of the maximal response to gastrin. Stimulant activity was not caused by gastrin release. As an agonist PD-136,450 was about 350 times less potent than gastrin-17 on a molar basis. In addition, PD-136,450 was a powerful agonist of pancreatic secretion in anaesthetised rats. The specific gastrin antagonist L-365,260 inhibited the (partial) agonist activity of PD-136,450 in the stomach and the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718 inhibited the agonist activity of PD-136,450 in the pancreas. It is concluded that the agonist effect of PD-136,450 is mediated via interaction with the gastrin (CCK-B) receptor in the stomach and the CCK-A receptor in the pancreas.",

Convulsions recurred before arrival at the ED in four of the 13 (30.8%). All of three patients who did not respond to rectal diazepam initially were 3 to 5 years old and had serious underlying comorbidity; two required endotracheal intubation in the ED and multiple anticonvulsants to terminate the seizure. No child treated with rectal diazepam required prehospital endotracheal intubation. All children who received IV diazepam stopped seizing after one dose ranging from 0.04 to 0.33 mg/kg. Convulsions recurred before arrival at the ED in nine of 15 children (60%); two required prehospital endotracheal intubation for profound respiratory depression.", 
    "110": "Rectal diazepam is a simple, effective, and safe method of prehospital management of pediatric status epilepticus. Compared with IV diazepam, rectal diazepam is easier to administer, especially in infants and toddlers; is equally efficacious; and is less likely to produce respiratory depression. Although respiratory depression is rare with rectal diazepam, prehospital personnel must be prepared to provide definitive respiratory support. Short duration of action is an important limitation of both treatments.",

The objective of the current trial was to determine if the addition of ondansetron to the combination of metoclopramide, dexamethasone, and lorazepam (MDL) could improve the control of vomiting in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin. The three-drug MDL antiemetic regimen has been shown to prevent vomiting in 67% of patients receiving high-dose cisplatin.",

    "114": "Vomiting was prevented in two thirds of patients treated with MDL plus ondansetron, a result similar to that observed in earlier trials of MDL alone. The lack of improvement in emetic control by the addition of ondansetron suggests that vomiting mediated through 5-HT3 receptors is already effectively blocked. Emesis that occurs despite pretreatment with MDL is likely mediated by other mechanisms.",

    "116": "In the kinetic experiments (n = 6), regional time-activity curves after a single bolus injection of the tracer were fit to a three-compartment model to provide estimates of the rate constants K1 to k4. The binding potential (equal to the product of the receptor density and affinity) was derived from the rate constants. In the equilibrium method (n = 8), the tracer bolus injection was followed by a constant tracer infusion to induce a sustained equilibrium state. The regional equilibrium volume of distribution was calculated as the ratio of the regional brain concentration-to-the free parent tracer steady-state plasma concentration. In three experiments, a receptor-saturating dose of flumazenil was injected for direct measurement of the nondisplaceable compartment distribution volume.",

    "119": "High-affinity binding sites for [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 with the properties of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor were detected in primary cultures of both mouse neocortical and cerebellar astrocytes. The binding sites were enriched in mitochondrial fractions on differential centrifugation. An 18-kDa polypeptide was specifically photolabelled in cerebellar astrocytes by [3H]PK 14105, a photolabel for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. However, this polypeptide did not show any reactivity with an antiserum previously raised against the corresponding polypeptide from rat adrenal gland. Various anticonvulsant and convulsant agents were tested for their ability and potency at inhibiting [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to neocortical astrocytes. Many of these compounds previously reported to be inhibitors of diazepam binding to neocortical astrocytes, proved ineffective in this study. No correlation was observed between convulsant/anticonvulsant potency and ability to inhibit [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in these cells. Thus, whereas some convulsants and anticonvulsants might interact with this astrocytic receptor, such a system has no validity as a general screening method for these agents."
