Nonphenothiazines, typical antipsychotics, can induce the formation of thyroid autoantibodies and can elevate TSH levels. Atypical antipsychotics may decrease TRH-stimulated TSH. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs complex with iodine and thyroid peroxidase and deactivate them, induce deiodinase activity and interfere with the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis by decreasing TSH response to TRH. The main effect with other antidepressant drugs is a decrease in circulating thyroid hormone levels. Lithium inhibits thyroid hormone release and increases TRH-stimulated TSH, inducing goiter, clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. Carbamazepine mainly reversibly decreases serum thyroid hormone levels. Other psychotropic drugs such as valproic acid, benzodiazepines, opiates, anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs, and stimulants have minor interferences with thyroid functions.",

    "4": "A series of thio-benzodiazepine p53-MDM2 inhibitors were designed and synthesized based on the principle of bioisosterism. Most of the thio-benzodiazepines had nanomolar to micromolar affinity toward MDM2. Particularly, compounds 8a (K(i) = 0.52\u03bcM) and 8f (K(i) = 0.32 \u03bcM) showed binding activity comparable to the positive drug nutlin-3a (K(i) = 0.23 \u03bcM). Meanwhile, compound 8j exhibited excellent antitumor activity against the U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cell line with an IC(50) value of 1.06 \u03bcM, which was about 23 times higher than that of nutlin-3a. The docking model also successfully predicted that this class of compounds mimicked three p53 critical residues binding to MDM2. The thio-benzodiazepines represent a promising class of non-peptide inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction.",

We previously reported findings from our optimization study of a high-throughput screening (HTS) derived lead compound 1a that resulted in the discovery of potent amidine-containing FXa inhibitors represented by compound 2. We also conducted an alternative optimization study of 1a without incorporating a strong basic amidine group, which generally has an adverse effect on the pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration. Replacement of 4-methoxybenzene with a 1,4-benzodiazepine structure and introduction of a hydroxy group at the central benzene led to the discovery of the potent and orally effective factor Xa inhibitor 14i (darexaban, YM150). Subsequent extensive study revealed a unique aspect to the pharmacokinetic profile of this compound, wherein the hydroxy moiety of 14i is rapidly transformed into its glucuronide conjugate 16 (YM-222714) as an active metabolite after oral administration and it plays a major role in expression of potent anticoagulant activity in plasma. The distinctive, potent activity of inhibitor 14i after oral dosing was explained by this unique pharmacokinetic profile and its favorable membrane permeability. Compound 14i is currently undergoing clinical development for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases.",

    "10": "The majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain is mediated by benzodiazepine-sensitive \u03b11-subunit-containing GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs); however, our knowledge of the mechanisms neurons use to regulate their synaptic accumulation is rudimentary. Using immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that GABA(A)Rs and gephyrin are intimately associated at inhibitory synapses in cultured rat neurons. In vitro we reveal that the E-domain of gephyrin directly binds to the \u03b11 subunit with an affinity of \u223c20 \u03bcm, mediated by residues 360-375 within the intracellular domain of this receptor subunit. Mutating residues 360-375 decreases both the accumulation of \u03b11-containing GABA(A)Rs at gephyrin-positive inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons and the amplitude of mIPSCs. We also demonstrate that the affinity of gephyrin for the \u03b11 subunit is modulated by Thr375, a putative phosphorylation site. Mutation of Thr375 to a phosphomimetic, negatively charged amino acid decreases both the affinity of the \u03b11 subunit for gephyrin, and therefore receptor accumulation at synapses, and the amplitude of mIPSCs. Finally, single-particle tracking reveals that gephyrin reduces the diffusion of \u03b11-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs specifically at inhibitory synapses, thereby increasing their confinement at these structures. Our results suggest that the direct binding of gephyrin to residues 360-375 of the \u03b11 subunit and its modulation are likely to be important determinants for the stabilization of GABA(A)Rs at synaptic sites, thereby modulating the strength of synaptic inhibition.", 
    "11": "The metabolic conversion of midazolam (MDZ) to its main metabolite 1'-hydroxy-midazolam (1-OH-MDZ) can be used as a probe drug for cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity. A sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of MDZ and its metabolite 1-OH-MDZ in human plasma using supported liquid extraction (SLE) in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection was developed and validated. Plasma samples (100 \u03bcL) were diluted with 0.5M NH(3) (aq) containing deuterated internal standards. The samples were extracted with ethyl acetate on a 96-well SLE-plate. Separation was performed on a Symmetry Shield RP18 column using an acidic gradient running from 2% to 95% methanol in 3 min. Detection was performed using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer running in positive electrospray selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The validated dynamic range was 0.2-100 nmol/L for both analytes. In the concentration range 0.6-75 nmol/L the extraction recoveries were in the ranges 91.2-98.6% and 94.5-98.3% for MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ, respectively. Matrix effects were more pronounced for MDZ than for 1-OH-MDZ but the response was still 75.4% or higher compared to a reference. The overall repeatability was within 2.2-7.6% for both analytes, the overall reproducibility was within 3.1-10.2% for both analytes and the overall accuracy bias was within -1.1 to 7.5% for both analytes. The method was successfully applied to determine the plasma concentrations of MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ in 14 healthy volunteers up to 24h after administration of a single oral dose of 2mg MDZ. The SLE technology was found to be convenient and suitable for sample preparation, and the developed method was found to be rapid, selective and reproducible for the simultaneous determination of MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ in human plasma.",

    "16": "Human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolizes a significant portion of clinically relevant drugs and often exhibits complex steady-state kinetics that can involve homotropic and heterotropic cooperativity between bound ligands. In previous studies, the hydroxylation of the sedative midazolam (MDZ) exhibited homotropic cooperativity via a decrease in the ratio of 1'-OH-MDZ to 4-OH-MDZ at higher drug concentrations. In this study, MDZ exhibited heterotropic cooperativity with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) with characteristic decreases in the 1'-OH-MDZ to 4-OH-MDZ ratios. To unravel the structural basis of MDZ cooperativity, we probed MDZ and CBZ bound to CYP3A4 using longitudinal T(1) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation and molecular docking with AutoDock 4.2. The distances calculated from longitudinal T(1) NMR relaxation were used during simulated annealing to constrain the molecules to the substrate-free X-ray crystal structure of CYP3A4. These simulations revealed that either two MDZ molecules or an MDZ molecule and a CBZ molecule assume a stacked configuration within the CYP3A4 active site. In either case, the proton at position 4 of the MDZ molecule was closer to the heme than the protons of the 1'-CH(3) group. In contrast, molecular docking of a single molecule of MDZ revealed that the molecule was preferentially oriented with the 1'-CH(3) position closer to the heme than position 4. This study provides the first detailed molecular analysis of heterotropic and homotropic cooperativity of a human cytochrome P450 from an NMR-based model. Cooperativity of ligand binding through direct interaction between stacked molecules may represent a common motif for homotropic and heterotropic cooperativity.",

Both drugs have been taken up very rapidly by the clinicians to treat acute seizures and status epilepticus, despite lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials. The favorable pharmacokinetic profile and the good tolerability, especially the lack of sedating effects of both drugs make them promising potential alternatives to the standard antiseizure drugs. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to inform clinicians better about the best choice of treatment in established status epilepticus. The experimental evidence as well as the current clinical experience with levetiracetam and lacosamide are summarized in this review.",

Results show that pretreatment of DOI dose-dependently reversed the acute disruptive effect of clozapine on both CS1 and CS2 avoidance responses, whereas it had little effect in reversing the acute effect of olanzapine. On the challenge test, pretreatment of DOI did not alter the clozapine-induced tolerance or the olanzapine-induced sensitization effect. These results confirmed our previous findings and suggest that clozapine, but not olanzapine, acts on through 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors to achieve its acute avoidance disruptive effect and likely its therapeutic effects.

In addition to sodium valproate, three were treated with steroids, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when the seizures relapsed while tapering or after stopping the steroids.", 
    "73": "All of the children had earlier onset (mean=2.4 years), increased frequency and increased duration of focal seizures compared to typical BECTS. Head drop and truncal sway due to axial or axiorhizomelic atonia occurring several times per day or week was the key manifestation. The atonic seizures worsened with carbamazepine in three, clonazepam in two and clobazam in one. When the atypical seizures commenced, some children developed one or more of the following problems: hyperactivity, attention deficit, clumsy gait, and mild cognitive or language dysfunction. Three children became seizure free, one on steroids and the other two on IVIG.", 
    "74": "BECTS in children with an early age of onset and frequent and prolonged seizures is more likely to evolve into atonic-BECTS. Carbamazepine and some benzodiazepines may worsen these seizures. Three children became seizure free with immunomodulatory therapy, one on steroids and the other two on IVIG, and had complete resolution of the transient motor and cognitive impairment. Atonic-BECTS needs to be differentiated from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome since it is potentially treatable and children recover with no sequel. Although all the children in this series continued to be on treatment with sodium valproate it is currently undetermined whether they would have required to do so if followed up for an extended period of time.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of midazolam premedication and parental presence during anesthetic induction on the incidence of postoperative agitation in pediatric patients.", 
    "76": "One hundred sixty-seven children between 2 years and 7 years of age, undergoing anesthesia for outpatient surgery, were enrolled and randomly divided into four groups: sevoflurane anesthesia with parental presence without premedication, sevoflurane anesthesia with oral midazolam premedication, halothane anesthesia with parental presence without premeditation, and halothane anesthesia with oral midazolam premedication. The children randomized to the premedication groups took oral midazolam 0.5mg/kg 20-30 minutes before anesthetic induction. For patients in the groups without premedication, one of the parents was present throughout the induction of anesthesia. One recovery room nurse blinded to the group assignment observed the patients and recorded the agitation scores all through their stay in the postanesthesia care unit.",

    "78": "Based on our data, the presence of a parent at induction of sevoflurance anesthesia was as effective as midazolam premedication in decreasing the incidence of postoperative agitation. Midazolam premedication, however, decreased postoperative agitation when halothane was used as the anesthetic agent.", 
    "79": "The second generation antipsychotic drug (SGA) olanzapine has an efficacy to treat schizophrenia, but can cause obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. Cholinergic muscarinic M3 receptors (M3R) are expressed on pancreatic \u03b2-cells and in the brain where they influence insulin secretion and may regulate other metabolic hormones via vagal innervation of the gastrointestinal tract. Olanzapine's M3R antagonism is an important risk factor for its diabetogenic liability. However, the effects of olanzapine on central M3Rs are unknown. Rats were treated with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg olanzapine/kg or vehicle (3\u00d7/day, 14-days). M3R binding densities in the hypothalamic arcuate (Arc) and ventromedial nuclei (VMH), and dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of the brainstem were investigated using [3H]4-DAMP plus pirenzepine and AF-DX116. M3R binding correlations to body weight, food intake, insulin, ghrelin and cholecystokinin (CCK) were analyzed. Olanzapine increased M3R binding density in the Arc, VMH and DVC, body weight, food intake, circulating plasma ghrelin and CCK levels, and decreased plasma insulin and glucose. M3R negatively correlated to insulin, and positively correlated to ghrelin, CCK, food intake and body weight. Increased M3R density is a compensatory up-regulation in response to olanzapine's M3R antagonism. Olanzapine acts on M3R in regions of the brain that control food intake and insulin secretion. Olanzapine's M3R blockade in the brain may inhibit the acetylcholine pathway for insulin secretion. These findings support a role for M3Rs in the modulation of insulin, ghrelin and CCK via the vagus nerve and provide a mechanism for olanzapine's diabetogenic and weight gain liability.",

    "82": "Benzodiazepines remain the most frequently used psychotropic drugs for the treatment of anxiety spectrum disorders; however, their use is associated with the development of tolerance and dependence. Another major hindrance is represented by their lack of efficacy in many patients, including patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For these nonresponders, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been the therapy of choice. In the past decade, clinical studies have suggested that the pharmacological action of SSRIs may include the ability of these drugs to normalise decreased brain levels of neurosteroids in patients with depression and PTSD; in particular, the progesterone derivative allopregnanolone, which potently, positively and allosterically modulates the action of GABA at GABA(A) receptors. Preclinical studies using the socially-isolated mouse as an animal model of PTSD have demonstrated that fluoxetine and congeners ameliorate anxiety-like behaviour, fear responses and aggressive behaviour expressed by such mice by increasing corticolimbic levels of allopregnanolone. This is a novel and more selective mechanism than serotonin reuptake inhibition, which, for half a century, has been considered to be the main molecular mechanism for the therapeutic action of SSRIs. Importantly, this finding may shed light on the high rates of SSRI resistance among patients with PTSD and depression, comprising disorders in which there appears to be a block in allopregnanolone synthesis. There are several different mechanisms by which such a block may occur, and SSRIs may only be corrective under some conditions. Thus, the up-regulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis in corticolimbic neurones may offer a novel nontraditional pharmacological target for a new generation of potent nonsedating, anxiolytic medications for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and PTSD: selective brain steroidogenic stimulants.",

    "86": "Psychological stress-induced hyperthermia is a fundamental autonomic response in mammals. However, the central circuitry underlying this stress response is poorly understood. Here, we sought to identify sympathetic premotor neurons that mediate a hyperthermic response to social defeat stress, a psychological stress model. Intruder rats that were defeated by a dominant resident conspecific exhibited a rapid increase in abdominal temperature by up to 2.0\u200a \u00b0C. In these defeated rats, we found that expression of Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was increased in the rostral medullary raphe region centered in the rostral raphe pallidus and adjacent raphe magnus nuclei. In this region, Fos expression was observed in a large population of neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter\u20033 (VGLUT3), which are known as sympathetic premotor neurons controlling non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and thermoregulatory constriction of skin blood vessels, and also in a small population of tryptophan hydroxylase-positive serotonergic neurons. Intraperitoneal injection of diazepam, an anxiolytic agent, but not indomethacin, an antipyretic, significantly reduced both the stress-induced hyperthermia and Fos expression in these medullary raphe neuronal populations. Systemic blockade of \u03b23 -adrenoreceptors, which are abundantly expressed in BAT, also attenuated the stress-induced hyperthermia. These results suggest that psychological stress signals activate VGLUT3-expressing medullary raphe sympathetic premotor neurons, which then drive hyperthermic effector responses including BAT thermogenesis through \u03b2(3) -adrenoreceptors.",

Opioid/benzodiazepine- and propofol-based PS have a similar safety profile and a low incidence of major adverse events. Propofol-based sedation turned out to be the most effective regimen, with effectiveness comparable to general anesthesia. The addition of midazolam, fentanyl, remifentanil, and/or ketamine to propofol may increase the effectiveness without creating more adverse events.

The HD chorea research literature fails to address the indications for drug treatment, drug selection, drug dosing and side effect profiles, management of inadequate response to a single drug, and preferred drug when behavioral symptoms comorbid to chorea are present. Because there is lack of an evidence base to inform clinical decision-making, we surveyed an international group of experts to address these points. Survey results showed that patient stigma, physical injury, gait instability, work interference, and disturbed sleep were indications for a drug treatment trial. However, the experts did not agree on first choice of chorea drug, with the majority of experts in Europe favoring an antipsychotic drug (APD), and a near equal split in first choice between an APD and tetrabenazine (TBZ) among experts from North America and Australia. All experts chose an APD when comorbid psychotic or aggressive behaviors were present, or when active depression prevented the use of TBZ. However, there was agreement from all geographic regions that both APDs and TBZ were acceptable as monotherapy in other situations. Perceived efficacy and side effect profiles were similar for APDs and TBZ, except for depression as a significant side effect of TBZ. Experts used a combination of an APD and TBZ when treatment required both drugs for control of chorea and a concurrent comorbid symptom, or when severe chorea was inadequately controlled by either drug alone. The benzodiazepines (BZDs) were judged ineffective as monotherapy but useful as adjunctive therapy, particularly when chorea was exacerbated by anxiety. There was broad disagreement about the use of amantadine for chorea. Experts who had used amantadine described its benefit as small and transient.

However, APDs were also endorsed as first choice for mild or moderate irritability, more frequently in Europe than in North America and Australia. Antiepileptic mood stabilizers (AEDs) were used by fewer respondents as first choice drug. Perceived efficacy for control of mild or moderate irritability was judged somewhat higher for APDs than SSRIs or AEDs. Benzodiazepines were not used as monotherapy, but frequently as an adjunctive drug in the setting of comorbid anxiety. Though many cited lack of experience with mirtazapine, others familiar with its use in HD chose it as an alternative monotherapy, or as adjunctive therapy if insomnia was a comorbid factor.

The complexity, delayed onset, and persistent nature of nerve agent induced CNS effects need to be elucidated to block their multiple effects. In the present study gene expression and phosphoprotein profile of certain key neuronal proteins were studied after soman exposure. Quantitative real time PCR analysis of c-Fos, Bax, CREB and caspase 3 genes in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum showed that only c-Fos and Bax mRNA expression was increased significantly. Western blot analysis also confirmed the induction of c-Fos at early time points both at 0.5 and 1.0 LD(50) dose of soman exposure. Acute soman exposure caused perturbations in the phosphorylation status of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, CREB, c-Jun and NF-\u03baB in all the three brain regions. The primary target for soman toxicity, AChE was inhibited in blood and brain up to 90%. Therapeutic treatment comprising of HI-6, atropine and diazepam has completely protected animals from death and reactivated soman inhibited AChE up to 40% in the plasma and RBC. This therapeutic regime also reduced soman induced Bax expression to near control levels, but could not reverse the soman induced changes in c-Fos expression and phosphorylation levels completely.

Midazolam and propofol have been examined with the aim of reducing emergence agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia. However the effect of both drugs on emergence agitation is still controversial. Therefore we designed this study to measure the effect of midazolam or propofol at the end of surgery on emergence agitation during the recovery period. One hundred and one children, aged one to 13 years, undergoing strabismus surgery were enrolled in this randomised double-blind study. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in N2O/O2. Children were randomly assigned to receive midazolam 0.05 mg/kg (group M, n = 35), propofol 1 mg/kg (group P, n = 31) or saline (group S, n = 35). A four-point scale was used to evaluate recovery characteristics upon awakening and during the first hour after emergence from anaesthesia. The incidence of emergence agitation in group M was 42.9% (15/35), in group P 48.4% (15/31) and in group S 74.3% (26/35). The incidence of emergence agitation in groups M and P was significantly less than in group S. The emergence time was prolonged for patients in groups M and P compared to group S.

    "119": "Parkinson's disease is frequently associated with psychological disorders, especially depression, psychotic disorders, and dementia. We examined the management of psychological disorders in Parkinson's disease, including the use of psychotropic drugs, by reviewing the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology. About one-third of patients with Parkinson's disease experience visual hallucinations. Other hallucinations and delusions can also occur. Dose reduction or withdrawal of certain antiparkinsonian drugs sometimes improves psychotic disorders, providing an acceptable level of symptom control. Clozapine is effective and does not worsen parkinsonian symptoms, but it carries a risk of severe adverse effects, including agranulocytosis. Other neuroleptics are ineffective or worsen motor status. Mood disorders and depression are frequent during the course of Parkinson's disease. Pramipexole, an antiparkinsonian dopamine agonist, improved depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease in one trial. Its main adverse effects are ocular disorders. Several trials have shown that some tricyclic antidepressants improve depression in Parkinson's patients, but these drugs can worsen cognitive status and cause postural hypotension. Data on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) are unconvincing. A meta-analysis of three trials showed that treatment withdrawals due to adverse events were similarly frequent with tricyclics and SSRIs. Dementia is frequent in end-stage Parkinson's disease. When severe cognitive disorders occur, it is advisable to withdraw any drugs capable of worsening the situation, especially drugs with antimuscarinic effects and benzodiazepines. Cholinesterase inhibitors have a negative harm-benefit balance in this setting. When a Parkinson's patient presents with a psychological disorder, the first step is to optimise antiparkinsonian treatment by striking a balance between motor control and psychological adverse effects. In the few situations in which drug treatment is likely to be beneficial, it should be remembered that psychotropic drugs are at best only moderately effective and should be used with care, monitoring patients for adverse effects.",

    "125": "The main aim of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive and critical verification of methodology commonly used for sample collection, storage and preparation in studies concerning the analysis of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in aqueous environmental samples with the usage of SPE-LC/MS techniques. This manuscript reports the results of investigations into several sample preparation parameters that to the authors' knowledge have not been reported or have received very little attention. This includes: (i) effect of evaporation temperature and (ii) solvent with regards to solid phase extraction (SPE) extracts; (iii) effect of silanising glassware; (iv) recovery of analytes during vacuum filtration through glass fibre filters and (v) pre LC-MS filter membranes. All of these parameters are vital to develop efficient and reliable extraction techniques; an essential factor given that target drug residues are often present in the aqueous environment at ng L(-1) levels. Presented is also the first comprehensive review of the stability of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Among the parameters studied are: time of storage, temperature and pH. Over 60 analytes were targeted including stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors, human urine indicators and their metabolites. The lack of stability of analytes in raw wastewater was found to be significant for many compounds. For instance, 34% of compounds studied reported a stability change >15% after only 12 h in raw wastewater stored at 2 \u00b0C; a very important finding given that wastewater is typically collected with the use of 24 h composite samplers. The stability of these compounds is also critical given the recent development of so-called 'sewage forensics' or 'sewage epidemiology' in which concentrations of target drug residues in wastewater are used to back-calculate drug consumption. Without an understanding of stability, under (or over) reporting of consumption estimations may take place.", 
    "126": "Presented is the first comprehensive study of drugs of abuse on suspended particulate matter (SPM) in wastewater. Analysis of SPM is crucial to prevent the under-reporting of the levels of analyte that may be present in wastewater. Analytical methods to date analyse the aqueous part of wastewater samples only, removing SPM through the use of filtration or centrifugation. The development of an analytical method to determine 60 compounds on SPM using a combination of pressurised liquid extraction, solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (PLE-SPE-LC-MS/MS) is reported. The range of compounds monitored included stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors, and their metabolites. The method was successfully validated (parameters studied: linearity and range, recovery, accuracy, reproducibility, repeatability, matrix effects, and limits of detection and quantification). The developed methodology was applied to SPM samples collected at three wastewater treatment plants in the UK. The average proportion of analyte on SPM as opposed to in the aqueous phase was <5% for several compounds including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, MDMA, and ketamine; whereas the proportion was >10% with regard to methadone, EDDP, EMDP, BZP, fentanyl, nortramadol, norpropoxyphene, sildenafil and all antidepressants (dosulepin, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine). Consequently, the lack of SPM analysis in wastewater sampling protocol could lead to the under-reporting of the measured concentration of some compounds.",

    "131": "Atypical or second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are associated with excessive body weight gain (BWG) and other components of metabolic syndrome. Among all SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine are known to cause the most significant weight gain, followed by risperidone and quetiapine. The genetic variant of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), -308 G>A polymorphism (rs1800629), has been implicated in clozapine-induced BWG in several studies. We hypothesized that TNF-\u03b1 -308 G>A polymorphism has a general effect on SGA-induced BWG. The present study was conducted to examine the association between TNF-\u03b1 -308 G>A polymorphism and BWG during treatment for schizophrenia using a variety of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). A total of 500 patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine (n=275), olanzapine (n=79) or risperidone (n=146) for an average of 49.9 months were recruited. Subjects with an increase in weight of more than 7% from the baseline before the current SGA treatment to the weight at the survey point were defined as having BWG. The association between TNF-\u03b1 -308 G>A polymorphism and BWG was studied, and the effect of non-genetic factors such as baseline BMI, SGA treatment duration and SGA type on the association was controlled by logistic regression. The results revealed that there was no significant association between BWG and TNF-\u03b1 -308 G>A polymorphism (GG/GA/AA or GG/GA+AA) in each separate SGA group or collectively. These findings suggest that TNF-\u03b1 -308 G>A polymorphism does not play a major role in SGA-induced weight gain.",

The relationship between agranulocytosis, SLE and olanzapine is still unknown. Fc\u03b3 receptor IIIb (Fc\u03b3RIIIb) is a low-affinity receptor, constitutively expressed only by neutrophils; NA1 and NA2 have been identified as representing polymorphisms of Fc\u03b3RIIIb. NA1 is associated with the incidence of autoimmune neutropenia and is particularly frequent in Asiatic ethnic groups. The Chinese patient resulted to be homozygous for NA1. We suggest that the presence of NA1 allele may be a predisposing factor to olanzapine-induced agranulocytosis in patients with SLE. Hence, the analysis of Fc\u03b3RIIIb polymorphism should be investigated in other cases of antipsychotic-induced agranulocytosis.",

The prescription of these medications in prison for anxiety and insomnia is not the preferred choice. In order to reduce these prescriptions, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-University Correctional HealthCare (UCHC), working within the New Jersey Department of Corrections, provided its psychiatrists with a guideline to the treatment of insomnia in prison. The guideline discouraged pharmacological treatment of insomnia. UCHC then anonymously compared the prescribing practices of its psychiatrists to each other, and educated the psychiatrists about the disadvantages of benzodiazepines and low-dose quetiapine in prison. These techniques reduced the numbers of inmates prescribed benzodiazepines by 38% after 20 months and reduced the numbers of inmates prescribed low-dose quetiapine by 59% after 22 months.", 
    "134": "Glutamate and GABA are the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS, and both may be involved in the neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative conditions. We have recently found that glutamate release was decreased in isolated synaptosomes from the rat cerebral cortex during the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis. In contrast to control animals where GABA induced a decrease in the evoked glutamate release, which was abolished by picrotoxin (a GABA(A) antagonist), synaptosomes from EAE rats showed a loss in the inhibition of the glutamate release mediated by GABA with a concomitant diminution of the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptor density. We have presently further evaluated the relevance of the GABAergic system in EAE by treating rats challenged for the disease with the GABA agonist diazepam. Administration of diazepam during 6 days starting at day 6 or 11 after EAE active induction led to a marked decrease of the disease incidence and histological signs associated with the disease. Cellular reactivity and antibody responses against the encephalitogenic myelin basic protein were also diminished. Beyond the effects of diazepam on the autoimmune, inflammatory response, we report also a positive effect on neurotransmission. Treatment with diazepam inhibited the previously described reduction in glutamate release in the frontal cortex synaptosomes from EAE animals. These data suggest that an endogenous inhibitory GABAergic system within the immune system is involved in the diazepam effect on EAE and indicate that increasing GABAergic activity potently ameliorates EAE.", 
    "135": "DNA-damaging therapies represent the most frequently used non-surgical anticancer strategies in the treatment of human tumors. These therapies can kill tumor cells, but at the same time they can be particularly damaging and mutagenic to healthy tissues. The efficacy of DNA-damaging treatments can be improved if tumor cell death is selectively enhanced, and the recent application of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in BRCA1/2-deficient tumors is a successful example of this. DNA damage is known to trigger cell-cycle arrest through activation of DNA-damage checkpoints. This arrest can be reversed once the damage has been repaired, but irreparable damage can promote apoptosis or senescence. Alternatively, cells can reenter the cell cycle before repair has been completed, giving rise to mutations. In this review we discuss the mechanisms involved in the activation and inactivation of DNA-damage checkpoints, and how the transition from arrest and cell-cycle re-entry is controlled. In addition, we discuss recent attempts to target the checkpoint in anticancer strategies.", 
    "136": "Selenomethionine (Se-Met) is the major dietary form of selenium (Se). While Se is a required nutrient, it can also influence the physiological stress response because it stimulates greater concentrations of cortisol in blood plasma of exposed fish. However, little is known about the effects of exposure to Se on the ability to cope with a secondary stressor. In the current study, female rainbow trout were exposed to an environmentally relevant dietary concentration (8.47 mg Se/kg dry mass (dm)) of Se-Met for 126 d, after which time fish were subjected to a 3-min handling stressor and sampled at 2h and 24h post-stressor exposure. Concentrations of cortisol, cortisone, glucose, and lactate in blood plasma and concentrations of glycogen and triglycerides in liver and muscle were determined. Abundances of transcripts of proteins involved in corticosteroidogenesis were determined using quantitative RT-PCR. Concentrations of cortisol were significantly greater in blood plasma of trout exposed to Se-Met, relative to control trout sampled prior to the handling stressor. A typical response of cortisol to the handling stressor was observed in the control trout. However, trout exposed to Se-Met were unable to mount a cortisol response to the handling stressor. Concentrations of cortisone, the inactive metabolite of cortisol, were significantly greater following the handling stressor in trout exposed to Se-Met. In trout exposed to Se-Met, transcript abundance of melanocortin 2 receptor (mc2r) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (pbr) were greater, which is consistent with the conclusion that synthesis of cortisol was greater. However, abundances of transcripts of cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (p450scc) and cytochrome P450 11B1 (cyp11b1) were not significantly different between controls and Se-Met exposed trout. Exposure to Se-Met affected accumulation and tissue partitioning of glycogen and triglycerides in liver and muscle as concentrations of these energy reserves were greater in muscle, but not liver. Concentrations of glycogen and triglycerides in muscle, but not in liver, were lesser following the handling stressor suggesting that the muscle energy reserves are an important source of energy required for recovery from the handling stressor. The results of the study demonstrate that chronic exposure to dietary Se-Met elicits a stress response, but prevents a cortisol response to a secondary handling stressor, most likely due to cortisol inactivation. Moreover, exposure to Se-Met has effects on concentrations of energy reserves that are important for providing the energy necessary to cope with a secondary stressor.",

    "141": "Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) is a serious and troubling crime. It is important to know if and how different drugs might be used to facilitate assault in order to deter such crime. There are a number of ways in which drugs that are used for DFSA might not be detected by routine screens. The purpose of this analysis was to draw reasonable inferences regarding drugs with a high likelihood of being used for DFSA and not being detected by routine screens. National data from poison control centres, hospital emergency rooms, and law enforcement seizures were used to evaluate the relative magnitude of problems and illicit availability associated with different classes of drugs. General drug classes were examined to include additional drugs that might be used for DFSA on the basis of their amnesic effects, widespread availability, and pharmacokinetics (i.e. short half-life). The benzodiazepine-site ligands zolpidem and eszopiclone, 'club drugs' GHB and ketamine, muscle relaxants such as carisoprodol, and antihistamines such as diphenhydramine were identified as drugs that might be used for DFSA and remain undetected by routine screens. Future studies that are designed to examine the role of these drugs in DFSA cases could provide better estimates of their use for DFSA. A better understanding of what is being missed in DFSA cases might help prioritize the development of new assays, provide rationale for the availability of particular assays for routine testing, and inform practitioners and the general public of the potential DFSA risks of certain drugs.",

Moreover, HCoV-OC43 is neuroinvasive, neurotropic, and neurovirulent in susceptible mice, where it induces chronic encephalitis. Herein, we show that a single point mutation in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein (Y241H), acquired during viral persistence in human neural cells, led to a hind-limb paralytic disease in infected mice. Inhibition of glutamate excitotoxicity using a 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)propranoic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (GYKI-52466) improved clinical scores related to the paralysis and motor disabilities in S mutant virus-infected mice, as well as protected the CNS from neuronal dysfunctions, as illustrated by restoration of the phosphorylation state of neurofilaments. Expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1, responsible for glutamate homeostasis, was downregulated following infection, and GYKI-52466 also significantly restored its steady-state expression level. Finally, GYKI-52466 treatment of S mutant virus-infected mice led to reduced microglial activation, which may lead to improvement in the regulation of CNS glutamate homeostasis. Taken together, our results strongly suggest an involvement of excitotoxicity in the paralysis-associated neuropathology induced by an HCoV-OC43 mutant which harbors a single point mutation in its spike protein that is acquired upon persistent virus infection.", 
    "148": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyses the exchange of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between HDL and apoB containing lipoprotein particles. The role of CETP in modulating plasma HDL cholesterol levels in humans is well established and there have been significant efforts to develop CETP inhibitors to increase HDL cholesterol for the treatment of coronary artery disease. These efforts, however, have been hampered by the fact that most CETP inhibitors either have low potency or have undesirable side effects. In this study, we describe a novel benzazepine compound evacetrapib (LY2484595), which is a potent and selective inhibitor of CETP both in vitro and in vivo. Evacetrapib inhibited human recombinant CETP protein (5.5 nM IC(50)) and CETP activity in human plasma (36 nM IC(50)) in vitro. In double transgenic mice expressing human CETP and apoAI, evacetrapib exhibited an ex vivo CETP inhibition ED(50) of less than 5 mg/kg at 8 h post oral dose and significantly elevated HDL cholesterol. Importantly, no blood pressure elevation was observed in rats dosed with evacetrapib at high exposure multiples compared with the positive control, torcetrapib. In addition, in a human adrenal cortical carcinoma cell line (H295R cells), evacetrapib did not induce aldosterone or cortisol biosynthesis whereas torcetrapib dramatically induced aldosterone and cortisol biosynthesis. Our data indicate that evacetrapib is a potent and selective CETP inhibitor without torcetrapib-like off-target liabilities. Evacetrapib is currently in phase II clinical development.",

However, the mechanisms by which antipsychotic drugs alter thermoregulatory processes in the human body are far from being fully understood. Here we present a case series of 5 patients developing severe hypothermia after administration of olanzapine and benperidol. Controlled by a network of neural structures, body temperature is physiologically regulated in far more narrow boundaries than are other vital functions, and its homeostasis is critical for survival. The preoptic region in the ventral hypothalamus is assumed to act as a coordinating center that is endowed with thermosensory units that constantly compare actual body temperature with target values and initiate regulatory and compensatory mechanisms in case of mismatch. Hypothermia risk seems to increase in the first days after initiation of antipsychotic drug therapy or increases in the daily dose. Schizophrenic patients bear a higher risk than nonschizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotic drugs (such as patients with dementia or depression). Antipsychotic drugs with strong 5-HT2 antagonism seem to be more frequently associated with hypothermia. These cases demonstrate the clinical relevance of hypothermia as an adverse reaction to antipsychotic treatment and the importance of careful monitoring of body temperature.",

The study included 481 schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine (n\u00a0=\u00a0266), olanzapine (n\u00a0=\u00a079), or risperidone (n\u00a0=\u00a0136) for an average of 49.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.2\u00a0months.

The BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism was not found to be associated with body weight gain. Haplotype analysis further showed that the rs11030101-T-allele-related haplotype is also associated with increased body weight gain (P\u00a0=\u00a00.047). Our findings suggest that there is a nominal association with rs11030101 but did not replicate the previously found relationship between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and body weight gain during long-term AAP treatment.", 
    "156": "Status epilepticus is characterized by a prolonged, self-sustaining seizure or repeated seizures without return to baseline. The clinical manifestations of status epilepticus in children and adults range from overt generalized convulsions to more subtle behavioral manifestations, including unresponsiveness in the setting of the intensive care unit. Status epilepticus is the most common neurologic emergency of childhood. A large proportion of these episodes are the result of a prolonged febrile seizure or an acute symptomatic etiology. Fortunately, status epilepticus occurs without consequence for many children, but for others, it is correlated with long-term neurologic dysfunction or death. Treatment of status epilepticus should commence promptly upon its recognition, using predefined treatment protocols. The goal of treatment is the rapid termination of the seizure, to minimize the acute and chronic effects of this emergency and to allow for the prompt assessment and management of the underlying precipitant. Currently, the drug class of first choice in the in-hospital and out-of-hospital treatment of status epilepticus is the benzodiazepines, which may need to be quickly followed by a next-line agent, as the efficacy of the benzodiazepines is negatively correlated with seizure duration. Traditionally, these next-line agents have included phenobarbital and phenytoin, but emerging evidence supports the use of intravenous formulations of other antiepileptic drugs. If the first two agents fail, high-dose intravenous midazolam or anesthetic therapy should be rapidly initiated. This paper reviews the current treatment options and strategies for pediatric patients with status epilepticus.", 
    "157": "When facing a choice between cocaine and a potent, albeit inessential, non-drug alternative (i.e. water sweetened with saccharin), most cocaine self-administering rats abstain from cocaine in favor of the non-drug pursuit, regardless of the dose available and even after extended drug use. Only a minority continues to take the drug despite the opportunity of making a different choice and increasing stakes. This pattern of individual variation could suggest that the majority of rats are resilient to addiction, taking cocaine by default of other options. Only a minority would be vulnerable to addiction. This study tested the hypothesis that rats choose to refrain from cocaine self-administration because cocaine would be conflictual, having both rewarding and anxiogenic properties. Contrary to this hypothesis, however, we report here that diazepam-a broad-spectrum benzodiazepine anxiolytic-did not decrease, but instead, further increased cocaine abstinence. Interestingly, although diazepam decreased locomotion, rats adapted to this effect by spending more time near the lever associated with the preferred reward, a behavior that minimized the need for locomotion at the moment of choice. When responding for cocaine or saccharin was analyzed separately, we found that diazepam decreased responding for cocaine without affecting responding for saccharin. Finally, the abstinence-promoting effects of diazepam were also induced in cocaine-preferring rats treated chronically with diazepam. Overall, this study demonstrates that abstinence from cocaine cannot be explained away by the anxiogenic effects of cocaine, thereby reinforcing the notion of resilience to addiction. It also supports the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of cocaine addiction.",

One variable that has not yet been analyzed is the endotracheal tube (ETT) size. Our retrospective electronic database review was performed on adult subjects that had a primary, non-emergent cardiac surgery in the last four years. The records of 936 patients were analyzed to find 193 patients meeting inclusion criteria. Due to the low number of 7.0 ETTs used in the study, this group was eliminated from analysis. The means for times to extubation for the two remaining groups were 7:45 standard deviation (SD) 4:27 (hrs:min) and 7:30 SD 4:48 (hrs:min) for patients managed with 8.0 and 9.0 ETTs respectively, with no statistically significant differences between the tube sizes p=0.2389.

Of these patients, all were living in their own homes and were experiencing multiple distressing target symptoms. 5 had been prescribed an antipsychotic for less than 3 months and only 1 had a total duration of treatment of more than 1 year. There was good evidence in all cases that alternative diagnoses and management strategies had been explored before prescribing an antipsychotic. However, in none was the full range of potential causes or interventions explored. In 6 cases a risk/benefit analysis for use of antipsychotic medicine was recorded and in 5 cases there was documented discussion of this with family or carers. Of the four patients who had been prescribed an antipsychotic for more than 3 months, three had had two or more medication reviews. The fourth patient had had a trial of stopping the medication. Prescribing of other psychotropic medication was also reviewed. Benzodiazepines were used sparingly (7.5%). Of note a significant minority of patients (10.4%) were prescribed 3 or more different psychotropic medications.",

The drugs most commonly used for ADA are the benzodiazepines diazepam (oral or rectal), clobazam and buccal or nasal midazolam, and lorazepam. Others include valproic acid, nitrazepam, acetazolamide, chloral hydrate, pyridoxine, and antipyretics.",

Prevention of clusters is a well-proven principle but its application has been little studied. Prevention of imminent seizures predicted by well-established triggers, defined risk factors, or premonitory minor seizure activity seems to be at the same time the most intelligent and the least investigated application of ADA and would deserve to be better studied.", 
    "198": "Benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs are widely used for the treatment of insomnia. Nevertheless, their adverse effects, such as next-day hangover, dependence and impairment of memory, make them unsuitable for long-term treatment. Melatonin has been used for improving sleep in patients with insomnia mainly because it does not cause hangover or show any addictive potential. However, there is a lack of consistency on its therapeutic value (partly because of its short half-life and the small quantities of melatonin employed). Thus, attention has been focused either on the development of more potent melatonin analogs with prolonged effects or on the design of slow release melatonin preparations. The MT(1) and MT(2) melatonergic receptor ramelteon was effective in increasing total sleep time and sleep efficiency, as well as in reducing sleep latency, in insomnia patients. The melatonergic antidepressant agomelatine, displaying potent MT(1) and MT(2) melatonergic agonism and relatively weak serotonin 5HT(2C) receptor antagonism, was found effective in the treatment of depressed patients. However, long-term safety studies are lacking for both melatonin agonists, particularly considering the pharmacological activity of their metabolites. In view of the higher binding affinities, longest half-life and relative higher potencies of the different melatonin agonists, studies using 2 or 3mg/day of melatonin are probably unsuitable to give appropriate comparison of the effects of the natural compound. Hence, clinical trials employing melatonin doses in the range of 50-100mg/day are warranted before the relative merits of the melatonin analogs versus melatonin can be settled.",

    "202": "The prevalence of asthma has taken on pandemic proportions. Since this disease predisposes patients to severe acute airway constriction, novel mechanisms capable of promoting airway smooth muscle relaxation would be clinically valuable. We have recently demonstrated that activation of endogenous airway smooth muscle GABA(A) receptors potentiates \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation, and molecular analysis of airway smooth muscle reveals that the \u03b1-subunit component of these GABA(A) receptors is limited to the \u03b1(4)- and \u03b1(5)-subunits. We questioned whether ligands with selective affinity for these GABA(A) receptors could promote relaxation of airway smooth muscle. RT-PCR analysis of GABA(A) receptor subunits was performed on RNA isolated by laser capture microdissection from human and guinea pig airway smooth muscle. Membrane potential and chloride-mediated current were measured in response to GABA(A) subunit-selective agonists in cultured human airway smooth muscle cells. Functional relaxation of precontracted guinea pig tracheal rings was assessed in the absence and presence of the \u03b1(4)-subunit-selective GABA(A) receptor agonists: gaboxadol, taurine, and a novel 8-methoxy imidazobenzodiazepine (CM-D-45). Only messenger RNA encoding the \u03b1(4)- and \u03b1(5)-GABA(A) receptor subunits was identified in RNA isolated by laser capture dissection from guinea pig and human airway smooth muscle tissues. Activation of airway smooth muscle GABA(A) receptors with agonists selective for these subunits resulted in appropriate membrane potential changes and chloride currents and promoted relaxation of airway smooth muscle. In conclusion, selective subunit targeting of endogenous airway smooth muscle-specific GABA(A) receptors may represent a novel therapeutic option for patients in severe bronchospasm.", 
    "203": "Inosine (INO) has an anticonvulsant effect against seizures induced by antagonists of GABAergic system. Quinolinic acid (QA) is an agonist NMDA receptors implicated in the neurobiology of seizures. In the present study, we investigated the anticonvulsant effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) INO administration against QA-induced seizures in adult mice. We also investigated whether the benzodiazepines (BZ) or adenosine (ADO) receptors were involved in the INO effects. Animals were pretreated with an i.c.v. injection of either vehicle or INO before an i.c.v. administration of 4 \u03bcl QA (36.8 nmol). All animals pretreated with vehicle followed by QA presented seizures. INO protected against QA-induced seizures in a time and dose dependent manner (up to 60% at 400 nmol, 5 min before QA injection). Diazepam (DZ) and ADO (i.c.v.) also exhibited anticonvulsant effect against QA induced seizures. Additionally, i.p. administration of either flumazenil, a BZ receptor antagonist, or caffeine, an ADO receptor antagonist, did not change the anticonvulsant potency of INO i.c.v. injection, but completely abolished the DZ and ADO anticonvulsant effects, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that INO exert anticonvulsant effect against hyperactivity of the glutamatergic system independently of BZ or ADO receptors activation.", 
    "204": "Isoliquiritigenin (ILTG) is a chalcone compound and has valuable pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antiallergic activities. Recently, the anxiolytic effect of ILTG has been reported; however, its action mechanism and hypnotic activity have not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, we investigated the hypnotic effect and action mechanism of ILTG. ILTG significantly potentiated the pentobarbital-induced sleep in mice at doses of 25 and 50mg/kg. The hypnotic activity of ILTG was fully inhibited by flumazenil (FLU), a specific gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A))-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist. The binding affinity of ILTG was 0.453 \u03bcM and was found to be higher than that of the reference compound, diazepam (DZP, 0.012 \u03bcM). ILTG (10(-5)M) potentiated GABA-evoked currents to 151% of the control level on isolated dorsal raphe neurons. ILTG has 65 times higher affinity for GABA(A)-BZD receptors than DZP, and the dissociation constant for ILTG was 4.0 \u00d7 10(-10)M. The effect of ILTG on GABA currents was blocked by 10(-7)M FLU and ZK-93426. These results suggest that ILTG produces hypnotic effects by positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A)-BZD receptors.",

The analysis of color density spectral array (CDSA) showed stereotyped changes indicative of recurrent focal nonconvulsive seizures (NCSz) and NCSE. We noted a close correlation between NCSz and BIS value changes. EEGs during working hours always confirmed the persistence of focal NCSE. After several days of sedation, CDSA disclosed a gradual resolution of NCSE that was also confirmed by electroencephalography. The patient died of cardiorespiratory complications a few days later.",

They were treated either with midazolam (98 cases) or dexmedetomidine (102 cases). In both groups fentanyl was given intravenously continually for analgesia. The amount of fentanyl was adjusted according to Prince-Henry analgesic score to keep on 1-2 analgesic score; the dose of sedation was regulated by Riker sedative and restless score (SAS) maintain 2-4 sedative score. During the course, parameters of the ventilator, electrocardiogram, heart rate(HR), blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), blood gas analysis were observed and registered continuously.

    "210": "Benzodiazepines are widely consumed psychiatric pharmaceuticals which are frequently detected in the environment. The environmental persistence and fate of these pharmaceuticals as well as their degradation products is of high relevance and it is, yet, scarcely elucidated. In this study, the relevance of photodegradation processes on the environmental persistence of four benzodiazepines (oxazepam, diazepam, lorazepam and alprazolam) was investigated. Benzodiazepines were irradiated under simulated solar irradiation and direct and indirect (together with three different fractions of humic substances) photodegradation kinetics were determined. Lorazepam was shown to be quickly photodegradated by direct solar radiation, with a half-life time lower than one summer sunny day. On the contrary, oxazepam, diazepam and alprazolam showed to be highly resistant to photodegradation with half-life times of 4, 7 and 228 summer sunny days, respectively. Apparent indirect and direct photodegradation rates are of the same order of magnitude. However, humic acids were consistently responsible for a decrease in the photodegradation rates while fulvic acids and XAD4 fraction caused an enhancement of the photodegradation. Overall, the results highlight that photodegradation might not be an efficient pathway to prevent the aquatic environmental accumulation of oxazepam, diazepam and alprazolam. Also, nineteen direct photodegradation products were identified by electrospray mass spectrometry, the majority of which are newly identified photoproducts. This identification is crucial to a more complete understanding of the environmental impact of benzodiazepines in aquatic systems.",
