In this study, we compared the main IAs used in forensic toxicology (Cloned Enzyme Donor Immunoassay, CEDIA\u00ae; Enzyme-Multiplied Immunoassay Technique, EMIT\u00ae; Fluorescent Polarization ImmunoAssay, FPIA\u00ae; Kinetic Interaction of Microparticles in Solution, KIMS\u00ae and Immunochromatographic Techniques, IMC) with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Twelve urine specimens were analyzed by 178 laboratories in Italy that participated in a National Proficiency Test, providing both qualitative and semi-quantitative results. Each IA was evaluated by the parameters: true positive, true negative, false positive (FP), false negative (FN), sensitivity (SENS), specificity (SPEC), positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy. SPEC was affected by a high FP rate for all IAs. The lowest SENS and NPV were provided by FPIA due to a high number of FN cases. Comparing IA semi-quantitative data with LC-MS-MS results, an overestimation of benzodiazepine amount is noted. This paper draws attention to the problem of the careless use of IA tests for forensic purposes as they may provide FP and/or FN results that can lead to errors of great severity.", 
    "1": "Difficulties with affect regulation and impulse control have a strong influence on violence. The objective of this study was to determine whether baseline depression and impulsivity predict aggression and whether they predict differential response to antiaggressive treatment. This is important, as we lack knowledge as to the selection of antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression.", 
    "2": "Physically aggressive inpatients with schizophrenia who received an evaluation of depression and impulsivity at baseline were randomly assigned in a double-blind, parallel group, 12-week trial to clozapine, olanzapine, or haloperidol. Trait impulsivity was measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale; depression by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Depression factor. The number and severity of aggressive events, as measured by the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS), were the outcome measures.", 
    "3": "Baseline depression and impulsivity predicted higher levels of aggression, as measured by the MOAS total score, over the 12-week treatment period across all 3 medication groups. In addition, there was a strong interaction effect between baseline depression/impulsivity and medication grouping in predicting MOAS score. In particular, when higher depression and impulsivity were present at baseline, patients on haloperidol presented with more aggression than patients on the other 3 medications.", 
    "4": "Depression and impulsivity are important predictors of aggression and of differential response to antiaggressive treatment. This is most likely due to the medications' dissimilar neurotransmitter profiles. By identifying patients who will respond better to a given medication, we will be able to develop individualized strategies for the treatment of violent behavior.", 
    "5": "Nine important 1,4-benzodiazepines and zolpidem were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using a multimode ionization source able to generate ions using both electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and a single quadrupole mass analyzer. An optimum chromatographic separation was applied for all target compounds in less than 8 minutes using a Zorbax Eclipse Plus column (100 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m) kept at 35\u00b0C and a 0.3% HCOOH/ACN/IPA (61:34:5) mobile phase pumped at 1 ml/min. Optimization of LC-MS method generated low limit of quantitation (LOQ) values situated in the range 0.3-20.5 ng/ml. Comparison between differences in method sensitivity, under specified chromatographic conditions, when using ESI-only, APCI-only, and simultaneous ESI-APCI ionization with such a multimode source was discussed. Mixed ESI-APCI(+) mode proved to be the most sensitive ionization generating an average 35% detector response increase compared to ESI-only ionization and 350% detector response increase with respect to APCI-only ionization. Characterization of the nine benzodiazepines and zolpidem concerning their MS fragmentation pathway following 'in-source' collision-induced dissociation is discussed in detail and some general trends regarding these fragmentations are set.", 
    "6": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl ester and triglycerides between plasma lipoprotein particles HDL and LDL/VLDL, resulting in equilibration between these lipoprotein fractions. Therapy that modulates HDL metabolism to increase HDL-c levels could be an effective strategy to reduce residual cardiovascular risk since it is estimated that for each mg/dL increase in plasma HDL cholesterol, there could be a 2-3% decrease in cardiovascular risk. Modification of the lipoprotein profile by CETP inhibitors is promising, but the beneficial effect of reducing coronary heart disease risk has not yet been proven. To date, four CETP inhibitors have advanced to phase 3 cardiovascular outcome clinical trials, and two have been terminated for off-target adverse effects and lack of efficacy. This perspective will summarize recent events, new research developments, and the discovery of new classes of CETP inhibitors.", 
    "7": "A double-balloon (DB) endoscope can be selectively inserted into the afferent loop to carry out endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with surgically altered anatomy, allowing various types of endoscopic treatments for pancreaticobiliary diseases to be successfully carried out. In order to make such a lengthy procedure more comfortable and safe, sedatives and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) insufflation are widely used for gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, these techniques can increase the risk of CO2 retention. Recently, a new sensor for transcutaneous measurement of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2 ) has been introduced. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2 ) during DB-ERCP with CO2 insufflation under conscious sedation and assess any complications related to sedation and CO2 insufflation.", 
    "8": "A total of 312 patients underwent DB-ERCP with CO2 insufflation at our hospital between March 2009 and December 2012. The patients were moderately sedated using midazolam with or without pentazocine. PtcCO2 was measured by a non-invasive sensor throughout DB-ERCP in all patients.", 
    "9": "The mean peak PtcCO2 during the procedure was significantly higher than the mean PtcCO2 value before and after DB-ERCP. Body mass index, procedure time and dose of pentazocine were significantly higher in the CO2 retention group (peak PtcCO2 \u2265 50 mmHg). CO2 narcosis was observed in one case.", 
    "10": "DB-ERCP with CO2 insufflation under conscious sedation might have the potential to increase the risk of CO2 retention. Hence, non-invasive and continuous PtcCO2 measurement is useful for early detection of hypercapnia.", 
    "11": "The use of opioids to treat chronic noncancer pain is controversial because of concerns about safety, efficacy, and the potential for addiction and abuse. Clinicians must therefore continue to seek out alternatives to opioids, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants.", 
    "12": "The use of midazolam for dental care in patients with intellectual disability is poorly documented. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conscious sedation procedures using intravenous midazolam in adults and children with intellectual disability (ID) compared to dentally anxious patients (DA). Ninety-eight patients with ID and 44 patients with DA programmed for intravenous midazolam participated in the study over 187 and 133 sessions, respectively. Evaluation criteria were success of dental treatment, cooperation level (modified Venham scale), and occurrence of adverse effects. The mean intravenous dose administered was 8.8\u00b14.9 mg and 9.8\u00b14.1 mg in ID and DA sessions respectively (t-test, NS). 50% N\u2082O/O\u2082 was administered during cannulation in 51% of ID sessions and 61% of DA sessions (NS, Fisher exact test). Oral or rectal midazolam premedication was administered for cannulation in 31% of ID sessions and 3% of DA sessions (p<0,001, Fisher exact test). Dental treatment was successful in 9 out of 10 sessions for both groups. Minor adverse effects occurred in 16.6% and 6.8% of ID and DA sessions respectively (p\u200a=\u200a0.01, Fisher exact test). Patients with ID were more often very disturbed during cannulation (25.4% ID vs. 3.9% DA sessions) and were less often relaxed after induction (58.9% ID vs. 90.3% DA) and during dental treatment (39.5% ID vs. 59.7% DA) (p<0.001, Fisher exact test) than patients with DA. When midazolam sedation was repeated, cooperation improved for both groups. Conscious sedation procedures using intravenous midazolam, with or without premedication and/or inhalation sedation (50% N\u2082O/O\u2082), were shown to be safe and effective in patients with intellectual disability when administered by dentists.", 
    "13": "A simple CE method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of chlordiazepoxide (CHL), amitriptyline, and nortriptyline (mixture I) or the determination of CHL and imipramine (mixture II) using the same BGE. Sertraline and amitriptyline were used as internal standards for the first and second mixtures, respectively. The method allows amitriptyline to be completely separated from its impurity and main metabolite nortriptyline, which can be quantified from 0.2 \u03bcg/mL. The separation was achieved using 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 5 containing 12 mM \u03b2-cyclodextrin and 1 mM carboxymethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. UV detection was performed at 200 nm and a voltage of 15 kV was applied on an uncoated fused-silica capillary at 25\u00b0C. These experimental conditions allowed separation of the compounds to be obtained in 7 min. Calibration graphs proved the linearity up to 40 \u03bcg/mL for CHL, up to 100 \u03bcg/mL for amitriptyline and imipramine, and up to 5 \u03bcg/mL for nortriptyline. The accuracy and precision of the method have been determined by analyzing synthetic mixtures and pharmaceutical formulations. The analytical results were quite good in all cases indicating that the method was linear, sensitive, precise, accurate, and selective for both mixtures.", 
    "14": "This study aimed to demonstrate that the dose of a CYP3A substrate (simvastatin) can be adapted individually on the basis of CYP3A activity as assessed by midazolam metabolic clearance. In 18 healthy participants individual CYP3A activity was quantified using midazolam metabolic clearance both alone and during CYP3A inhibition with 40\u2009mg ritonavir. Thereafter, simvastatin acid exposure was determined after a simvastatin standard dose (40\u2009mg) and doses adapted to individual CYP3A activity at baseline and during CYP3A inhibition. Interindividual variability of CYP3A activity and simvastatin acid AUC0-24 was large and both correlated (r(2) \u2009=\u20090.745, P\u2009<\u2009.001). The adapted simvastatin doses ranged from 25 to 80\u2009mg and their administration reduced simvastatin variability fivefold. Despite the low adapted simvastatin dose of 12\u2009mg during CYP3A inhibition with ritonavir, exposure increased (point estimate of 4.2 [90% CI: 3.15-5.61]) probably caused by additional OATP1B1 inhibition. CYP3A activity-based dose adaptation can be used to reduce interindividual variability in simvastatin exposure.",

In November 2011, the questionnaire was sent to 1,078 intensivists identified from the French ICU Society (SRLF) database.", 
    "18": "The questionnaire was returned by 195 intensivists (response rate 18.1%), representing 135 of the 282 ICUs (47.8%) listed in the French ICU society (SRLF) database. The analysis showed that midazolam and sufentanil are the most frequently used hypnotics and opioids, respectively, administered in continuous intravenous (IV) infusions. IV boluses of hypnotics without subsequent continuous IV infusion are used occasionally (in <25% of patients) by 65% of intensivists. Anxiolytic benzodiazepines (e.g., clorazepam, alprazolam), hydroxyzine, and typical neuroleptics, via either an enteral or IV route, are used occasionally by two thirds of respondents. The existence of a written, local sedation management procedure in the ICU is reported by 55% of respondents, 54% of whom declare that they use it routinely. Written local sedation procedures mainly rely on titration of continuous IV hypnotics (90% of the sedation procedures); less frequently, sedation procedures describe alternative approaches to prevent oversedation, including daily interruption of continuous IV hypnotic infusion, hypnotic boluses with no subsequent continuous IV infusion, or the use of nonhypnotic drugs. Among the responding intensivists, 98% consider eye opening, either spontaneously or after light physical stimulation, a reasonable target consciousness level in patients with no severe respiratory failure or intracranial hypertension.", 
    "19": "Despite a low individual response rate, the respondents to our survey represent almost half of the ICUs in the French SRLF database. The presence of a written local sedation procedure, a cornerstone of preventing oversedation, is reported by only half of respondents; when present, it is used in for a limited number of patients. Sedation procedures mainly rely on titration of continuous IV hypnotics, but other strategies to limit oversedation also are included in sedation procedures. French intensivists no longer consider severely altered consciousness a sedation objective for most patients.",

The most frequent main agents were opioids (25%), ethanol (9%), benzodiazepines (8%), corrosive substances (7%), carbon monoxide (5%), and neuroleptics (5%). Pre-hospital treatment was given to 73% of patients; 3% were intubated, and antidotes were given in 27% (naloxone 24%, atropine 2%, and flumazenil 0.2%). Gastric lavage was performed in 34%, but only 20% within the first hour after ingestion; 49% had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)< 15, but only 6% of them were intubated in the ambulance. Activated charcoal was given to two patients, both with a GCS = 15. A suicidal behavior was the strongest predictor for hospitalization.", 
    "23": "This study reveals current practice differing from the common treatment practice in most places, especially concerning the use of gastric lavage. Whether the current practice led to an increased morbidity and mortality is uncertain, but it justifies the need for thorough evaluation of clinical practice.

Pretreatment was similar regarding substance groups (benzodiazepine as first line, levetiracetam as second line drug) and bolus doses. Status epilepticus was terminated in six patients (40%) of the PHT group and in seven patients (33%) of the LCM group. Four patients (27%) of the PHT group and no patient of the LCM group suffered from a relevant, treatment-related side effect during administration of the third drug.",

    "28": "A cluster of phosphorylation sites in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), including Ser910, Ser935, Ser955 and Ser973, is important for PD (Parkinson's disease) pathogenesis as several PD-linked LRRK2 mutants are dephosphorylated at these sites. LRRK2 is also dephosphorylated in cells after pharmacological inhibition of its kinase activity, which is currently proposed as a strategy for disease-modifying PD therapy. Despite this importance of LRRK2 dephosphorylation in mutant LRRK2 pathological mechanism(s) and in LRRK2's response to inhibition, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Therefore we aimed to identify the phosphatase for LRRK2. Using a panel of recombinant phosphatases, we found that PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) efficiently dephosphorylates LRRK2 in vitro. PP1 activity on LRRK2 dephosphorylation was confirmed in cells using PP1 inhibition to reverse LRRK2 dephosphorylation induced by the potent LRRK2 kinase inhibitor LRRK2-IN1 as well as in R1441G mutant LRRK2. We also found that PP1 and LRRK2 can form a complex in cells. Furthermore, we observed that PP1 inhibition modulates LRRK2's cellular phenotype by reducing skein-like LRRK2-positive structures associated with dephosphorylation. In conclusion, the present study reveals PP1 as the physiological LRRK2 phosphatase, responsible for LRRK2 dephosphorylation observed in PD mutant LRRK2 and after LRRK2 kinase inhibition.", 
    "29": "Photoaffinity labeling, a useful in vivo biochemical tool, is limited when applied in vivo because of the poor tissue penetration by ultraviolet (UV) photons. This study investigates affinity labeling using tissue-penetrating radiation to overcome the tissue attenuation and irreversibly label membrane receptor proteins. Using X-ray (115 kVp) at low doses (<50 cGy or Rad), specific and irreversible binding was found on striatal dopamine transporters with 3 photoaffinity ligands for dopamine transporters, to different extents. Upon X-ray exposure (115 kVp), RTI-38 and RTI-78 ligands showed irreversible and specific binding to the dopamine transporter similar to those seen with UV exposure under other conditions. Similarly, gamma rays at higher energy (662 keV) also affect irreversible binding of photoreactive ligands to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (by PK14105) and to the dopamine (D2) membrane receptors (by azidoclebopride), respectively. This study reports that X-ray and gamma rays induced affinity labeling of membrane receptors in a manner similar to UV with photoreactive ligands of the dopamine transporter, D2 dopamine receptor (D2R), and peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBDZR). It may provide specific noninvasive irreversible block or stimulation of a receptor using tissue-penetrating radiation targeting selected anatomic sites.",

    "32": "A total of 972 patients were identified, with 894 undergoing cholecystectomy. In 259 patients, symptoms had started <3 months prior to evaluation. Functional gallbladder imaging revealed a mean gallbladder ejection fraction of 23.1 \u00b1 0.7 %; of the patients undergoing surgery, 116 had a normal gallbladder ejection fraction. Sufficient up data for pre- and post-operative assessment of resource utilization was available for 368 patients. Emergency room (ER) visits decreased from 0.86 \u00b1 0.07 to 0.69 \u00b1 0.03 (P < 0.05), while hospitalization rates remained unchanged after surgery. Patients not meeting consensus criteria for the diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia were more likely to use opioids and have ER visits prior to and after cholecystectomy. Using multiple logistic regression benzodiazepine use, migraine history and prior ER visits independently predicted postoperative resource utilization.", 
    "33": "Our data demonstrate that a significant number of patients undergo cholecystectomy for biliary dyskinesia, even though they do not meet currently accepted diagnostic criteria. While healthcare resource utilization drops within the first year after surgery, ER visits and hospitalizations remain common, suggesting a more limited benefit of surgical approaches in these patients.", 
    "34": "The concurrent use of opioids, benzodiazepines (BZDs), and/or alcohol poses a formidable challenge for clinicians who manage chronic pain. While the escalating use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain and the concomitant rise in opioid-related abuse and misuse are widely recognized trends, the contribution of combination use of BZDs, alcohol, and/or other sedative agents to opioid-related morbidity and mortality is underappreciated, even when these agents are used appropriately. Patients with chronic pain who use opioid analgesics along with BZDs and/or alcohol are at higher risk for fatal/nonfatal overdose and have more aberrant behaviors. Few practice guidelines for BZD treatment are readily available, especially when they are combined clinically with opioid analgesics and other central nervous system-depressant agents. However, coadministration of these agents produces a defined increase in rates of adverse events, overdose, and death, warranting close monitoring and consideration when treating patients with pain. To improve patient outcomes, ongoing screening for aberrant behavior, monitoring of treatment compliance, documentation of medical necessity, and the adjustment of treatment to clinical changes are essential. In this article, we review the prevalence and pharmacologic consequences of BZDs and/or alcohol use among patients with pain on chronic opioid therapy, as well as the importance of urine drug testing, an indispensable tool for therapeutic drug monitoring, which helps to ensure the continued safety of patients. Regardless of risk or known aberrant drug-related behaviors, patients on chronic opioid therapy should periodically undergo urine drug testing to confirm adherence to the treatment plan.",

High levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and/or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in the serum. Corticosteroid treatment usually results in an improvement of symptoms. The syndrome is frequently overlooked and, therefore, the authors strongly recommend testing serum thyroid autoantibodies in cases with encephalopathy of unknown origin independently on the presence of thyroid disease in the patient or family history.

    "37": "A systematic comparison between two labeling approaches for the investigation of the in vitro metabolic pattern of pharmaceutical drugs was performed by examining the use of (i) radiolabeled drugs analyzed with LC-MS-offline radiodetection and (ii) stable-isotope labeled drugs, used in a defined mixture with the unlabeled drug and analyzed by LC-MS with recognition of the specific isotopic pattern. (14)C was used for the radioisotope-approach and deuterium for the stable-isotope approach. Olanzapine, diclofenac and ketoconazole were chosen as model drugs, as they are commercially available in their non-, radio- and stable-isotope labeled forms. For all three model drugs, liver microsome- and hepatocyte-incubations (both from rat) were performed with various concentrations and incubation times for both, the radio- and the stable-isotope approaches. The metabolic pattern, including structure elucidation of all detected metabolites, was performed independently for all individual compounds and incubations. Subsequently, the metabolic patterns of the radio-, and the stable-isotope approaches were compared. In conclusion, all metabolites found with the radioisotope approach could also be found with the stable-isotope approach. Although the stable-isotope approach does not provide a quantitative result, it can be considered to be a highly suited analytical alternative for early in vitro metabolism investigations, especially when radiolabeled drug analogues are not yet available and quantitative results are not yet necessary.",

Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted images in brain magnetic resonance imaging showed white-matter hyperintensity in the frontal lobe and periventricular area. Her manic symptoms and psychotic features improved following daily administration of valproate (600 mg) and olanzapine (10 mg).

The median symptom duration prior to diagnosis was 4 (9.5) years. Several patients underwent unnecessary procedures prior to being appropriately diagnosed. Over a median of 2 (3.5) years, signs and symptoms progressed to impair walking. Seven patients had improvement in gait with treatment (e.g. botulinum toxin injections, benzodiazepines, physical therapy, bracing, body weight supported gait training and/or functional electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve) and six returned to a reduced intensity exercise routine.", 
    "42": "Isolated lower extremity dystonia associated with strenuous, repetitive exercise is relatively uncommon, but disabling and challenging to treat.

    "43": "The pharmacokinetics of the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, display large interindividual variation leading to multiple-fold differences in drug exposure between patients at a given dose. This variation in turn gives rise to the need for individualized dosing in order to avoid concentration-dependent adverse effects or therapeutic failure. Genetically determined differences in olanzapine metabolism represent a less studied source of variability in comparison to environmental and physiological factors. In this review, we summarize available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the influence of polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes on olanzapine serum exposure. The polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme appears to have no significant influence on olanzapine steady-state serum concentrations. The formation of the various olanzapine metabolites is influenced by polymorphisms in the genes coding for CYP1A2, CYP1A expression regulator AHR, UGT1A4 and UGT2B10, as well as FMO3. An impact on steady-state olanzapine serum concentrations has been suggested for variants of CYP1A2 and UGT1A4, with somewhat conflicting findings. The potential involvement of FMO1 and CYP3A43 in olanzapine disposition has also been suggested but needs future validation.", 
    "44": "Benzodiazepines are among the most prescribed compounds and are commonly present in many toxicological screens. They are also of concern forensically in cases of drug facilitated sexual assault. Currently these compounds are predominantly analyzed using immunoassay techniques; however more specific screening methods are needed. This paper demonstrates the applicability of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy as a method for the analysis and detection of benzodiazepines. The procedure involves mixing urine extracts with gold nanoparticles and appropriate aggregating agents for trace detection of these compounds and their metabolites. In this paper we will discuss the optimization of various parameters of this technique as well as its application to screening urine samples. Eleven different benzodiazepines and metabolites were examined, including 1,2-triazolo-benzodiazepines and 1,4-benzodiazpines. Experiments were performed using four different chloride salts, MgCl2, CaCl2, KCl, and NaCl, as aggregating agents for the colloidal gold nanoparticles. Overall it was found that each aggregating agent produced different levels of signal enhancement for each drug. MgCl2 provided the lowest limit of detection at 2.5 ng mL(-1), and linearity over a wide range of concentrations for a variety of drugs chosen. It was also determined that the optimum MgCl2 concentration was 1.67 M. This method has shown the applicability of SERS for the detection of trace quantities of benzodiazepines in aqueous solutions as well as the optimization of the technique over a wide range of compounds. This technique can be utilized in the detection of trace benzodiazepines in toxicological samples following extraction of the analyte.",

Antidepressant-like effect of etazolate has been previously demonstrated in the rodent models of depression. The present study was designed to investigate the anxiolytic-like activity of etazolate in experimental mouse models of anxiety. The putative anxiolytic effect of etazolate (0.25-1 mg/kg, ip) was studied in mice by using a battery of behavioural tests of anxiety such as elevated plus maze (EPM), light/dark (L/D) aversion, hole board (HB) and open field (OFT) with diazepam (2 mg/kg, ip) as reference anxiolytic. Like diazepam (2 mg/kg, ip), etazolate (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, ip) significantly increased the percentage of both time spent and entries into open arms in the EPM test. In the L/D test etazolate (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, ip) increased the both total time spent in and latency time to leave the light compartment. Etazolate (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, ip) also significantly increased head dipping scores and time spent in head dipping, whereas significantly decreased the head dipping latency in HB test. In addition, etazolate (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, ip) significantly increased the ambulation scores (square crossed) and number of rearing in OFT. In conclusion, these findings indicated that etazolate exhibited an anxiolytic-like effect in experimental models of anxiety and may be considered an alternative approach for the management of anxiety disorder.",

Most studies to date have focused on the potential effects of OLZ on the central nervous system's mediation of weight; however, peripheral changes in liver or other key metabolic organs may also play a role in the systemic effects of OLZ. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of OLZ on hepatic metabolism in a mouse model of OLZ exposure. Female C57Bl/6J mice were administered OLZ (8 mg/kg per day) or vehicle subcutaneously by osmotic minipumps for 28 days. Liver and plasma were taken at sacrifice for biochemical analyses and for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis. OLZ increased body weight, fat pad mass, and liver-to-body weight ratio without commensurate increase in food consumption, indicating that OLZ altered energy expenditure. Expression and biochemical analyses indicated that OLZ induced anaerobic glycolysis and caused a pseudo-fasted state, which depleted hepatic glycogen reserves. OLZ caused similar effects in cultured HepG2 cells, as determined by Seahorse analysis. Metabolomic analysis indicated that OLZ increased hepatic concentrations of amino acids that can alter metabolism via the mTOR pathway; indeed, hepatic mTOR signaling was robustly increased by OLZ. Interestingly, OLZ concomitantly activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. Taken together, these data suggest that disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism caused by OLZ in liver may be mediated, at least in part, via simultaneous activation of both catabolic (AMPK) and anabolic (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathways, which yields new insight into the metabolic side effects of this drug.", 
    "58": "GC with nitrogen phosphorus detection and HPLC with UV detection were used to determine midazolam (MDZ) levels in rabbit plasma following ocular and nasal administration. For GC with nitrogen phosphorus detection, the analyte was extracted from the plasma using a three-step liquid-liquid extraction including extraction with an isopropanol/butyl chloride mixture in an alkaline solution, followed by extractions with 1 M HCl, and finally with an alkaline solution of butyl chloride. The recovery of MDZ was dependent on the sample alkalization time prior to the final extraction. The procedure increased the recovery of MDZ up to 99.6%. Improved sample preparation led to a significant increase in the sensitivity of the determination by GC with nitrogen phosphorus detection. The achieved detection limit was 0.34 ng/mL, which is ten times lower than that obtained using HPLC with UV detection. The small plasma volume was another advantage of the GC with nitrogen phosphorus detection method (200 \u03bcL per assay). Both administration routes of the anesthetic (nasal and ocular) resulted in comparable plasma MDZ levels. Kinetic simulation of the MDZ plasma was performed for both administration routes.",

This was a prospective, randomized, between-subjects experimental study. Fifty-five rats were assigned to 1 Sof 5 groups with 11 rats per group: control (vehicle), xanthohumol, midazolam, midazolam with xanthohumol, and flumazenil with xanthohumol. In this study the elevated plus maze measured the behavioral components of anxiety and motor movements. A 2-tailed multivariate analysis of variance and least significant difference post hoc test was used to determine if a significant difference existed. Our data suggest that xanthohumol does not produce anxiolysis by modulation of the GABAA receptor; however, there may be a possible interaction between xanthohumol and midazolam, or xanthohumol may influence the modulation of another neurotransmitter site in the central nervous system. Alone, xanthohumol does not show significant modulation of the benzodiazepine receptor. Additional research should investigate if xanthohumol acts as a benzodiazepine GABAA partial agonist or antagonist or if it modulates another neurotransmitter system in the central nervous system.",

Baker (Annonaceae) and established its mechanism of action. The essential oil (EO) from the leaf, fruit and seed was obtained by hydrodistillation, followed by isolation of BPNE purified to 99.2% by accelerated gradient chromatography on silica, and identified by NMR and GC-MS. The pure BPNE and EO of the dried seed (93.6%) were comparatively evaluated for hypnotic, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects in mice. The acute toxicity of BPNE was determined and the LD50 was 490 mg/kg, intrapritonealy. The hypnotic activities of the EO and BPNE (50-400 mg/kg, i.p.) were assessed by loss of righting reflex, while sodium pentobarbitone (PBS) and diazepam (DZM) were used as positive controls. The anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects of the EO and BPNE were evaluated in mice. Both BPNE and EO at doses \u2265100 mg/kg induced spontaneous hypnosis with loss of righting reflex, significantly decreased sleep latency (SL) and also increased total sleeping time (TST) dose-dependently. They had comparable activity with NAP in TST. The BPNE exhibited higher hypnotic potency than EO at the same dose levels. The EO and BPNE offered comparable dose-related protections against PTZ- and strychnine-induced convulsions. Flumazenil (2 mg/kg) blocked the hypnotic and anticonvulsant (PTZ-convulsions) effects of both EO and BPNE. The essential oil at 5-20 mg/kg dose levels significantly (p<0.05) increased the percentage time spent and number of entries into the open arms. While at the same dose range BPNE significantly (p<0.05) increased the percentage time spent and the number of entries into the open arms respectively. The study concluded that 1-nitro-2-phenylethane exhibited dose dependent significant hypnotic, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects and it is the compound largely responsible for the neuropharmacological effects of the oil.",

A total of 42 patients were randomly assigned by means of sealed envelopes to receive risperidone (3-12 mg/day; n=20) and olanzapine (10-40 mg/day; n=22), with follow-up at 8 weeks. The Negative score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was significantly higher in patients who required high doses than in patients who responded to conventional doses. Serum olanzapine concentrations at the time of oral 20mg/day could be obtained from 5 out of 7 patients who subsequently required high-dose olanzapine.

However, the rapid half-life of these drugs in rats, in combination with development of drug tolerance after a few weeks of treatment, has limited the validity of the model. In order to prevent fluctuating drug serum concentrations seen with daily repeated administrations, we injected female rats with a single intramuscular dose of long-acting olanzapine formulation. The olanzapine depot injection yielded plasma olanzapine concentrations in the range of those achieved in patients, and induced changes in metabolic parameters similar to those previously observed with oral administration, including increased food intake, weight gain and elevated plasma triglycerides. Moreover, the sensitivity to olanzapine was maintained beyond the 2-3\u00a0wk of weight gain observed with oral administration. In a separate olanzapine depot experiment, we aimed to clarify the role of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in olanzapine-induced weight gain, which has been subject to debate. Adenovirus-mediated inhibition of AMPK was performed in the arcuate (ARC) or the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) nuclei in female rats, with subsequent injection of olanzapine depot solution. Inhibition of AMPK in the ARC, but not in the VMH, attenuated the weight-inducing effect of olanzapine, suggesting an important role for ARC-specific AMPK activation in mediating the orexigenic potential of olanzapine. Taken together, olanzapine depot formulation provides an improved mode of drug administration, preventing fluctuating plasma concentrations, reducing handling stress and opening up possibilities to perform complex mechanistic studies.",

    "91": "Zoletil\u00ae is an equal amount combination of the NMDA receptor antagonist, tiletamine, and the benzodiazepine, zolazepam, usually used as a veterinary anesthetic. Previous studies have shown that pre-exposure to Zoletil\u00ae and other psychoactive drugs (e.g. ketamine, diazepam) plays a significant role in the abuse liability of the compound. However, these studies were only focused on illicit psychoactive drugs and not on the more widely used licit psychoactive substances. Thus, the goal of the present work is to investigate whether pre-exposure to the three most commonly used licit psychoactive substances (caffeine, nicotine, and ethanol) affects the rewarding and reinforcing effects of Zoletil\u00ae. Rats were pretreated with caffeine (1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg), nicotine (125 or 250 \u03bcg/kg), ethanol (0.5, 2, or 4 g/kg), or saline (1 ml/kg) for 14 days, and evaluated for subsequent Zoletil\u00ae place preference (2.5 mg/kg) and self-administration (250 \u03bcg/kg). Zoletil\u00ae produced neither place preference nor self-administration in saline-pretreated rats. Pre-exposure to caffeine or nicotine does not have significant effects on Zoletil\u00ae's abuse potential. However, pretreatment of ethanol significantly produced Zoletil\u00ae place preference and self-administration. These results suggest that individuals who are exposed to ethanol may have a high propensity to use/abuse Zoletil\u00ae. More importantly, the present result advocates the careful monitoring on the use and dispensation of Zoletil\u00ae or related substances.", 
    "92": "Verapamil and its major metabolite norverapamil were identified to be both mechanism-based inhibitors and substrates of CYP3A and reported to have non-linear pharmacokinetics in clinic. Metabolic clearances of verapamil and norverapmil as well as their effects on CYP3A activity were firstly measured in pooled human liver microsomes. The results showed that S-isomers were more preferential to be metabolized than R-isomers for both verapamil and norverapamil, and their inhibitory effects on CYP3A activity were also stereoselective with S-isomers more potent than R-isomers. A semi-physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (semi-PBPK) characterizing mechanism-based auto-inhibition was developed to predict the stereoselective pharmacokinetic profiles of verapamil and norverapamil following single or multiple oral doses. Good simulation was obtained, which indicated that the developed semi-PBPK model can simultaneously predict pharmacokinetic profiles of S-verapamil, R-verapamil, S-norverapamil and R-norverapamil. Contributions of auto-inhibition to verapamil and norverapamil accumulation were also investigated following the 38th oral dose of verapamil sustained-release tablet (240mg once daily). The predicted accumulation ratio was about 1.3-1.5 fold, which was close to the observed data of 1.4-2.1-fold. Finally, the developed semi-PBPK model was further applied to predict drug-drug interactions (DDI) between verapamil and other three CYP3A substrates including midazolam, simvastatin, and cyclosporine A. Successful prediction was also obtained, which indicated that the developed semi-PBPK model incorporating auto-inhibition also showed great advantage on DDI prediction with CYP3A substrates.", 
    "93": "Radioligand receptor binding assays are a common method to evaluate the affinity of newly synthesized benzodiazepine ligands for the receptor. [(3)H]-flumazenil is an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors and is generally used as a radioligand. In this study, the binding parameters of [(3)H]-flumazenil to rat cortical membranes were evaluated using two separation methods: filtration with GF/C filters and centrifugation. Additionally, the effects of vacuum pressure, exposure time to the cocktail, and geometry on the filtration method were studied. The binding parameters of [(3)H]-flumazenil (Kd and Bmax) were determined through saturation studies using two methods. The results from this study showed that the filtration method is time consuming and requires more steps to be completed. Because filtration causes partial elution of bound [(3)H]-flumazenil into the liquid scintillation cocktail, the results are not reproducible, which result in inaccurate estimation of the binding parameters. The centrifugation method in contrast to filtration is straightforward and produces reproducible as well as reliable results, all of the steps are performed in a single polypropylene tube, which eliminates the loss of tissue and avoids other systematic errors associated with transfer and handling.",

The injection of non-convulsant doses of the muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine (PILO) induces long-lasting anxiogenic responses in rats evaluated at different time-points (24h to 3 months). To investigate the underlying mechanisms, rats treated with PILO (150mg/kg) were injected 24h or 1 month later with an anxiolytic (diazepam, 1mg/kg, DZP) or anxiogenic (pentylenetetrazole, 15mg/kg, PTZ) drug and evaluated in the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal (HIP) electroencephalographic recordings and acetylcolinesterase (AChE) activity were also analyzed after PILO treatment. Anxiogenic responses observed in the EPM 24h or 1 month after PILO treatment (e.g., decreased time spent and number of entries into the open arms of the maze) were blocked by DZP but not affected by PTZ. No epileptiform events were registered in the HIP or PFC at 24h or 1 month after PILO injection, but enhanced theta activity was observed in the HIP. DZP decreased hippocampal theta of PILO-treated rats in contrast with PTZ, which increased this parameter in saline- and PILO-treated rats. The HIP and PFC AChE activity did not change after PILO treatment. Our findings demonstrate that the long-term effects on the emotionality of rats induced by PILO are associated with electrophysiological changes in the HIP and sensitive to pharmacological manipulation of the GABAergic system. The present work may support this new research model of long-lasting anxiety, while also highlighting the muscarinic system as a potential target involved in anxiety disorders.",

    "108": "The purpose of the study was to describe toxicological findings among women seeking health care after sexual assault, and to assess the relationship with so-called proactive DFSA (drug facilitated sexual assault). We also explored associations between ethanol in blood/urine and background data, assault characteristics, and clinical findings. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of female patients \u2265 12 years of age consulting the Sexual Assault Center at St. Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. They were examined between July 1, 2003 and December 31, 2010, and urine and/or blood were analyzed for ethanol and selected medicinal/recreational drugs. Among the 264 patients included, ethanol and/or drugs were detected in 155 (59%). Of the 50 patients (19%) testing positive for drugs other than ethanol, benzodiazepines/benzodiazepine-like drugs were found in 31, central stimulants in 14, cannabinoids in 13 and opioids in nine. None tested positive for gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). In total, 57 patients (22%) suspected proactive DFSA, but only five had findings of sedative drugs that were not accounted for by self-reported voluntary intake. No cases could unequivocally be attributed to proactive DFSA. Among the 120 patients tested for ethanol within 12 h after the assault, 102 were positive. The median estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of assault was 1.87 g/L. Patients testing positive for ethanol more often reported a public place of assault and a stranger assailant. Higher estimated BAC at the time of assault was associated with higher frequency of suspecting proactive DFSA. Ethanol was the most prevalent toxicological finding in urine/blood from victims of sexual assault, and high ethanol concentrations were often detected. Among the patients suspecting proactive DFSA, very few had sedative drug findings not explained by voluntary intake. It seems like opportunistic DFSA, rather than proactive DFSA dominate among the sexually assaulted attending our SAC.", 
    "109": "Nowadays traffic accidents, which have high mortality and morbidity, are an important public health problem. The association between the use of alcohol and/or drugs by drivers and the increased risk of traffic accidents with a high risk of death and injury has been well described in the literature. This study aimed to review the incidence of cases of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) among all cases of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and/or other drugs involved in traffic accidents and to evaluate the type of the psychoactive drugs (with or without alcohol) detected in blood samples in Istanbul and its surrounding area. This study is the first investigation on the subject of DUID cases in Turkey. The reports of the Istanbul Toxicology Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine (Turkey) on suspected DUID cases involved in traffic accidents between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed for alcohol and/or drug use. Alcohol analysis was requested in 4274 suspected DUI cases, whereas drug along with alcohol analysis was requested in only 91. The rate of suspected DUID cases (n = 91) among the suspected DUI cases (n = 4274) was only 2.1% and in this study, we evaluated only the DUID cases in detail. Alcohol was present in 44% of suspected DUID cases. Psychoactive drugs were present in 15.4% of cases. The incidence among 46 confirmed DUID cases was found to be 17.4% for cannabis, 8.7% for benzodiazepines, 4.3% for barbiturates, 4.3% for antidepressants, 2.2% for cocaine and 2.2% for amphetamines. Although there is a zero-tolerance approach for DUID in the Turkish regulations, it is not well recognised and not inspected by police and legal authorities who are responsible for taking measures in traffic accidents and for routine traffic controls in Turkey. It is concluded that psychoactive drugs should be checked as well as alcohol in all traffic accident cases and roadside controls.",

The goal of the study was to investigate the co-occurrence of indicators of addictive behaviors in patients with chronic non-cancer pain in long-term opioid treatment. The study combined data from the individual-based Danish Health Survey in 2010 and the official Danish health and socio-economic, individual-based registers. From a simple random sample of 25,000 adults (16 years or older) living in Denmark, 13,281 individuals were analyzed through multiple logistic regression analyses to assess the association between chronic pain (lasting \u22656 months), opioid use, health behavior, and body mass index. Six potential addictive behaviors were identified: daily smoking; high alcohol intake; illicit drug use in the past year; obesity; long-term use of benzodiazepines; and long-term use of benzodiazepine-related drugs. At least 2 of the 6 addictive behaviors were observed in 22.6% of the long-term opioid users with chronic pain compared with 11.5% of the non-opioid users with chronic pain and 8.9% of the individuals without chronic pain. Thus, a strong association was demonstrated between long-term opioid use and the clustering of addictive behaviors. An intricate relationship between chronic pain, opioid use, and addictive behaviors was observed in this study, which deserves both clinical attention and further research.", 
    "111": "We have previously described that silencing of the mitochondrial protein OPA1 enhances mitochondrial Ca(2+) signaling and aldosterone production in H295R adrenocortical cells. Since extramitochondrial OPA1 (emOPA1) was reported to facilitate cAMP-induced lipolysis, we hypothesized that emOPA1, via the enhanced hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, augments aldosterone production in H295R cells. A few OPA1 immunopositive spots were detected in \u223c40% of the cells. In cell fractionation studies OPA1/COX IV (mitochondrial marker) ratio in the post-mitochondrial fractions was an order of magnitude higher than that in the mitochondrial fraction. The ratio of long to short OPA1 isoforms was lower in post-mitochondrial than in mitochondrial fractions. Knockdown of OPA1 failed to reduce db-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), Ca(2+) signaling and aldosterone secretion. In conclusion, OPA1 could be detected in the post-mitochondrial fractions, nevertheless, OPA1 did not interfere with the cAMP - PKA - HSL mediated activation of aldosterone secretion.",

A total of 436 children aged 5 months to 10 years with convulsions persisting for more than 5 minutes were assigned to receive intrarectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, n = 202) or sublingual lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg, n = 234). Sublingual lorazepam stopped seizures within 10 minutes of administration in 56% of children compared with intrarectal diazepam in 79% (P < .001). The probability of treatment failure is higher in case of sublingual lorazepam use (OR = 2.95, 95% CI = 1.91-4.55).

The mixture of 0.3 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) medetomidine (Med.), 4.0 mg/kg b.w. midazoram (Mid.), and 5.0 mg/kg b.w. butorphanol (But.) produced an anesthetic duration of around 40 min in outbred ICR mice. However, the anesthetic effect of the mixture for inbred mice strains remains unknown. Therefore, we examined anesthetic effects of the mixture of Med., Mid., and But. in the BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains. After intraperitoneal injection into mice, right front paw, left hind paw, and tail pinch reflexes as well as corneal and righting reflexes were observed. Every 5 min, we scored each reflex category as 0 for reaction or 1 for no reaction. As long as the total score was at least 4 out of 5, we considered the mixture as putting a mouse in a surgical anesthetic state. The mixture produced an anesthetic duration of more than 45 min in both strains of mice.

Conscious sedation using midazolam and opioids is the current standard method of sedation in diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy. Interestingly, propofol is a commonly preferred sedation method by endoscopists due to higher satisfaction rates along with its short half-life and thus lower risk of hepatic encephalopathy. On the other hand, midazolam is the benzodiazepine of choice because of its shorter duration of action and better pharmacokinetic profile compared with diazepam. The administration of sedation under the supervision of a properly trained endoscopist could become the standard practice and the urgent development of an updated international consensus regarding the use of sedative agents like propofol is needed.",

In this study, Solexa sequencing technology was performed to profile the gene expression changes in the midgut of silkworms in response to 24h of phoxim exposure and the impact on detoxification, apoptosis and immune defense were addressed. The results showed that 254 genes displayed at least 2.0-fold changes in expression levels, with 148 genes up-regulated and 106 genes down-regulated. Cytochrome P450 played an important role in detoxification. Histopathology examination and transmission electron microscope revealed swollen mitochondria and disappearance of the cristae of mitochondria, which are the important features in insect apoptotic cells.

Treatment can be difficult in these patients because of the complex interactions between antipsychotic and antiepileptic drugs. Some antipsychotic drugs also decrease the seizure threshold. We report the case of a 49-year-old man with a hypothalamic hamartoma, with a history of both gelastic and temporal lobe seizures. The patient was rendered seizure-free after three neurosurgical procedures but developed a drug-resistant paranoid psychosis. He was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). After two weeks with six stimulations that resulted in seizures, the psychiatric phenomena disappeared completely. There was no relapse of either the psychiatric symptoms or the seizures during the 42 months of follow-up. This case report suggests that ECT might be safe for psychosis in patients with a history of seizures that have previously been successfully treated with neurosurgery, although caution should be exercised in drawing general conclusions from a single case report.",

However, it is unclear as to whether it is necessary to keep D\u2082 receptor occupancy within this therapeutic window to maintain clinical response. The data set from phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial was reappraised. Thirty patients receiving risperidone (12 patients), olanzapine (12 patients), or ziprasidone (6 patients) fulfilled the following definition of remission and were included: a score of 3 or less on the 8 specific items in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (ie, P1, P2, P3, N1, N4, N6, G5, and G9; adopted from Andreasen et al, 2005) at the initial assessment and months 1, 2, and 6. Peak and trough D\u2082 receptor occupancy levels at month 6 were estimated from plasma antipsychotic concentrations using population pharmacokinetic analysis and our D\u2082 prediction model. Estimated mean \u00b1 SD peak and trough D\u2082 receptor occupancy levels at month 6 were 70.3% \u00b1 9.8% and 60.5% \u00b1 20.2%, respectively; among these individuals, 46.7% (14 patients) did not achieve continuous blockade of 65% or greater (ie, trough D\u2082 occupancy of <65%). In conclusion, approximately half of patients with remission did not achieve continuous blockade of estimated D\u2082 receptor occupancy 5% or greater. These results extend our previous findings and suggest that sustained D\u2082 receptor occupancy greater than 65% may not always be necessary for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "146": "Increased accumulation of p53 tumor suppressor protein is an early response to low-level stressors. To investigate the fate of mitochondrial-sequestered p53, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) on a p53-deficient genetic background were transfected with p53-EGFP fusion protein led by a sense (m53-EGFP) or antisense (c53-EGFP) mitochondrial import signal. Rotenone exposure (100nM, 1h) triggered the translocation of m53-EGFP from the mitochondrion to the nucleus, thus shifting the transfected cells from a mitochondrial p53 to a nuclear p53 state. Antibodies for p53 serine phosphorylation or lysine acetylation indicated a different post-translational status of recombinant p53 in the nucleus and mitochondrion, respectively. These data suggest that cycling of p53 through the mitochondria may establish a direct pathway for p53 signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus during mitochondrial dysfunction. PK11195, a pharmacological ligand of mitochondrial TSPO (formerly known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor), partially suppressed the release of mitochondria-sequestered p53. These findings support the notion that p53 function mediates a direct signaling pathway from the mitochondria to nucleus during mitochondrial dysfunction.",

None of the tested doses of '6o' affected the base line locomotion. Compound '6o' (2 mg/kg, ip) and diazepam (2 mg/kg, ip) significantly increased the percentage of both time spent and open arm entries in the EPM test. Compound '6o' in (1 mg/kg, ip) dose was only able to affect the percentage time spent in open arm significantly in the EPM test. In the light and dark test, compound '6o' (2 mg/kg, ip) and diazepam (2 mg/kg, ip) significantly increased the total time spent in light compartment as well as number of transitions from one compartment to other and number of square crossed. Compound '6o' (1 and 2 mg/kg, ip) and diazepam (2 mg/kg, ip) also significantly increased number of head dips and number of squares crossed, whereas significantly decreased the head dipping latency in HB test as compared to vehicle control group. In addition, '6o' in both the doses and diazepam (2 mg/kg, ip) significantly increased the ambulation scores (squares crossed) in OFT however, there was no significant effect of '6o' (1 and 2 mg/kg, ip) and diazepam (2 mg/kg, ip) on rearing scores.

    "157": "The neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorders characterized by progressive intellectual and motor deterioration, seizures, and early death. Visual loss is a feature of most forms. Clinical phenotypes have been characterized traditionally according to the age of onset and order of appearance of clinical features into infantile, late-infantile, juvenile, adult, and Northern epilepsy (also known as progressive epilepsy with mental retardation [EPMR]). There is however genetic and allelic heterogeneity; a proposed new nomenclature and classification system has been developed to take into account both the responsible gene and the age at disease onset; for example, CLN1 disease, infantile onset and CLN1 disease, juvenile onset are both caused by pathogenic variants in PPT1 but with differing age of onset. The most prevalent NCLs are CLN3 disease, classic juvenile and CLN2 disease, classic late infantile (although prevalence varies by ethnicity and country of family origin): CLN2 disease, classic late infantile. The first symptoms typically appear between age two and four years, usually starting with epilepsy, followed by regression of developmental milestones, myoclonic ataxia, and pyramidal signs. Visual impairment typically appears at age four to six years and rapidly progresses to light /dark awareness only. Life expectancy ranges from age six years to early teenage. CLN3 disease, classic juvenile. Onset is usually between ages four and ten years. Rapidly progressing visual loss resulting in severe visual impairment within one to two years is often the first clinical sign. Epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or complex-partial seizures typically appears around age ten years. Life expectancy ranges from the late teens to the 30s. Other forms of NCL may present with behavior changes, epilepsy, visual impairment, or slowing of developmental progress and then loss of skills. The course may be extremely variable.

    "170": "The involvement of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its active peptides, particularly angiotensin II (Ang II), has been described not only in hypertension, but also in stress-associated anxiety disorders. Ang II and its two subtypes of receptors, viz. AT1 and AT2, are localized on stress-responsive brain areas including the hypothalamus-adrenal-pituitary (HPA) axis. The different types of stressors increase the levels of Ang II and change the expression of its receptors. Transgenic animals with a centrally inactivated angiotensin system demonstrate increased anxiety-related behavior describing the anxiolytic effects of basal Ang II. However, studies showing the anxiolytic potential of AT1 receptor antagonists have described the anxiogenic effects of endogenously released Ang II. It suggests that the basal Ang II (in low amount) may attenuate anxiety, while stress-released Ang II (in high amount) may produce anxiety. By employing AT2-deficient mice, the functional role of AT2 receptors in attenuating stress-associated anxiety has been described. Moreover, AT1 receptor antagonists-induced anti-anxiety effects are associated with up-regulation of AT2 receptors in the brain suggesting that the centrally acting AT2 receptor agonists may serve as potential anxiolytic agents. The present review discusses the dual role of Ang II and its receptors in the development of stress-associated anxiety along with its interrelationship with benzodiazepines (BZD) receptors, and other stress mediators including corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and serotonin (5-HT).",

Computational analysis of the transannular cyclization of the 11-membered macrocyclic intermediate shows that asperlicin C is the kinetically favored product due to the high stability of a conformation resembling the transition state for cyclization, while asperlicin D is thermodynamically more stable.", 
    "185": "Activators of the slow delayed rectifier K\u207a current (IKs) have been suggested as promising tools for suppressing ventricular arrhythmias due to prolongation of repolarization. Recently, L-364,373 (R-L3) was nominated to activate IKs in myocytes from several species; however, in some studies, it failed to activate IKs. One later study suggested opposite modulating effects from the R-L3 enantiomers as a possible explanation for this discrepancy. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of the RL-3 enantiomers on IKs in ventricular mammalian myocytes, by applying standard microelectrode and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques at 37 \u00b0C. We synthesized 2 substances, ZS_1270B (right) and ZS_1271B (left), the 2 enantiomers of R-L3. In rabbit myocytes, ZS_1270B enhanced the IKs tail current by approximately 30%, whereas ZS_1271B reduced IKs tails by 45%. In guinea pig right ventricular preparations, ZS_1270B shortened APD90 (action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization) by 12%, whereas ZS_1271B lengthened it by approximately 15%. We concluded that R-L3 enantiomers in the same concentration range indeed have opposite modulating effects on IKs, which may explain why the racemic drug R-L3 previously failed to activate IKs. ZS_1270B is a potent IKs activator, therefore, this substance is appropriate to test whether IKs activators are ideal tools to suppress ventricular arrhythmias originating from prolongation of action potentials.", 
    "186": "The binding of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) to inverted CCAAT boxes (ICBs) within the promoter region of DNA topoisomerase II\u03b1 results in control of cell differentiation and cell cycle progression. Thus, NF-Y inhibitory small molecules could be employed to inhibit the replication of cancer cells. A library of pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) C8-conjugates consisting of one PBD unit attached to tri-heterocyclic polyamide fragments was designed and synthesized. The DNA-binding affinity and sequence selectivity of each compound were evaluated in DNA thermal denaturation and DNase I footprinting assays, and the ability to inhibit binding of NF-Y to ICB1 and ICB2 was studied using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). 3a was found to be a potent inhibitor of NF-Y binding, exhibiting a 10-fold selectivity for an ICB2 site compared to an ICB1-containing sequence, and showing low nanomolar cytotoxicity toward human tumor cell lines. Molecular modeling and computational studies have provided details of the covalent attachment process that leads to formation of the PBD-DNA adduct, and have allowed the preference of 3a for ICB2 to be rationalized.", 
    "187": "Benzodiazepines have been considered the treatment of choice for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. They are currently much more controversial and drugs considered less dangerous are generally preferred. This article summarizes the characteristics of the different benzodiazepines present on the Belgian market. It describes abuse and dependence, as well as the risks of these substances in specific populations or situations. New data suggest that there is a much higher risk of decease in case of a chronic use. Finally, recommendations on rational use and withdrawal are given.", 
    "188": "We aimed to provide a consensus statement by the International Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Study Group (IRBD-SG) on devising controlled active treatment studies in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and devising studies of neuroprotection against Parkinson disease (PD) and related neurodegeneration in RBD.", 
    "189": "The consensus statement was generated during the fourth IRBD-SG symposium in Marburg, Germany in 2011. The IRBD-SG identified essential methodologic components for a randomized trial in RBD, including potential screening and diagnostic criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary and secondary outcomes for symptomatic therapy trials (particularly for melatonin and clonazepam), and potential primary and secondary outcomes for eventual trials with disease-modifying and neuroprotective agents. The latter trials are considered urgent, given the high conversion rate from idiopathic RBD (iRBD) to Parkinsonian disorders (i.e., PD, dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], multiple system atrophy [MSA]).", 
    "190": "Six inclusion criteria were identified for symptomatic therapy and neuroprotective trials: (1) diagnosis of RBD needs to satisfy the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition, (ICSD-2) criteria; (2) minimum frequency of RBD episodes should preferably be \u2a7e2 times weekly to allow for assessment of change; (3) if the PD-RBD target population is included, it should be in the early stages of PD defined as Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3 in Off (untreated); (4) iRBD patients with soft neurologic dysfunction and with operational criteria established by the consensus of study investigators; (5) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI); and (6) optimally treated comorbid OSA. Twenty-four exclusion criteria were identified. The primary outcome measure for RBD treatment trials was determined to be the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) efficacy index, consisting of a four-point scale with a four-point side-effect scale. Assessment of video-polysomnographic (vPSG) changes holds promise but is costly and needs further elaboration. Secondary outcome measures include sleep diaries; sleepiness scales; PD sleep scale 2 (PDSS-2); serial motor examinations; cognitive indices; mood and anxiety indices; assessment of frequency of falls, gait impairment, and apathy; fatigue severity scale; and actigraphy and customized bed alarm systems. Consensus also was established for evaluating the clinical and vPSG aspects of RBD. End points for neuroprotective trials in RBD, taking lessons from research in PD, should be focused on the ultimate goal of determining the performance of disease-modifying agents. To date no compound with convincing evidence of disease-modifying or neuroprotective efficacy has been identified in PD. Nevertheless, iRBD patients are considered ideal candidates for neuroprotective studies.", 
    "191": "The IRBD-SG provides an important platform for developing multinational collaborative studies on RBD such as on environmental risk factors for iRBD, as recently reported in a peer-reviewed journal article, and on controlled active treatment studies for symptomatic and neuroprotective therapy that emerged during the 2011 consensus conference in Marburg, Germany, as described in our report.", 
    "192": "Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of transcranial focal electrical stimulation (TFS) applied via tripolar concentric ring electrodes, alone and associated with a sub-effective dose of diazepam (DZP) on the expression of status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine (LP) and subsequent neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Immediately before pilocarpine injection, male Wistar rats received TFS (300Hz, 200-\u03bcs biphasic square charge-balanced 50-mA constant current pulses for 2min) alone or combined with a sub-effective dose of DZP (0.41mg/kg, i.p.). In contrast with DZP or TFS alone, DZP plus TFS reduced the incidence of, and enhanced the latency to, mild and severe generalized seizures and SE induced by LP. These effects were associated with a significant reduction in the number of degenerated neurons in the hippocampus. The present study supports the notion that TFS combined with sub-effective doses of DZP may represent a therapeutic tool to induce anticonvulsant effects and reduce the SE-induced neuronal damage.",

    "195": "Part 1 of the present study involved independently presenting a case vignette of a patient with PIUO to six experienced physicians who care for children with neurological impairments. They were asked for medication choices and sequences to empirically treat PIUO. Part 2 was a pilot study of a PIUO protocol. Patients followed a standard pathway for PIUO, referred to as the pathway for unknown pain (PUP). The initial drug sequence for the PUP was based on Part 1.", 
    "196": "In Part 1, physicians responding to the case vignette listed eight medications (atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, gabapentin, methadone, opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tramadol and tricylic antidepressants) and eight empiric drug sequences. In Part 2, eight children with PIUO (six to 17 years of age; five females, three males) were enrolled in a pilot clinic. Only two had been fully evaluated for nociceptive-inflammatory pain sources before enrollment. At the end of the pilot study, four patients were clinically improved and only three required a study medication.", 
    "197": "Even experienced physicians do not agree on a common approach for medical treatment of PIUO. A standardized pathway is feasible and readily implemented. The proposed PUP has the potential to address PIUO and be the basis for future intervention studies.", 
    "198": "In this review article, we describe the unrecognized roles of glutamate and glutamate receptors in malignant glioma biology. The neurotransmitter glutamate released from malignant glioma cells in the extracellular matrix is responsible for seizure induction and at higher concentration neuronal cell death. This neuronal cell death will create vacated place for tumor growth. Glutamate also stimulates the growth and the migration of glial tumor cells by means of the activation of glutamate receptors on glioma cells in a paracrine and autocrine manner. The multitude of effects of glutamate in glioma biology supports the rationale for pharmacological targeting of glutamate receptors and transporters in the adjuvant treatment of malignant gliomas in neurology and neuro-oncology. Using the website www.clinicaltrials.gov/ as a reference - a service developed by the National Library of Medicine for the National Health Institute in USA - we have evoked the few clinical trials completed and currently ongoing with therapies targeting the glutamate receptors.", 
    "199": "The baroreceptors in the neck and aortic arch are important regulators of sudden blood pressure changes. They are innervated by CN IX and X and synapse in the brainstem. Baroreceptor failure is an under-recognized cause of recurrent syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and volatile hypertension, which is refractory to and may in fact worsen with conventional treatments. Baroreflex failure can be the result of neck and chest radiation, head and neck surgery, and cerebrovascular accidents involving the brainstem nuclei. The management of baroreflex failure is a challenge since patient education, lifestyle changes, and family support are extremely important in managing blood pressure. Leg exercises and Thrombo-Embolic Deterrent Stockings (TED) stockings are important in treating orthostatic hypotension. Clonidine is the antihypertensive of choice for supine hypertension. Low-dose benzodiazepines are helpful in suppressing sympathetic surges. We have encountered two patients with baroreflex failure after chemotherapy and radiation to the neck or upper chest. Temporal relationship between symptoms onset and the history of head, neck, and upper chest radiation or trauma is important in reaching a diagnosis.", 
    "200": "This study was aimed to assess whether (123)I-iomazenil (IMZ) single photon emission computed tomography can serially monitor the effects of bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) transplantation on neuronal integrity in infarct brain of rats.", 
    "201": "The BMSCs were harvested from green fluorescent protein-transgenic rats and were cultured. The rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Their motor function was serially quantified throughout the experiments. The BMSCs or vehicle was stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum at 7 days after the insult. Using small-animal single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography apparatus, the (123)I-IMZ uptake was serially measured at 6 and 35 days after the insult. Finally, fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the distribution of engrafted cells and their phenotypes.", 
    "202": "The distribution of (123)I-IMZ was markedly decreased in the ipsilateral neocortex at 6 days postischemia. The vehicle-transplanted animals did not show a significant change at 35 days postischemia. However, BMSC transplantation significantly improved the distribution of (123)I-IMZ in the peri-infarct neocortex as well as motor function. The engrafted BMSCs were densely distributed around cerebral infarct, and some of them expressed neuronal nuclear antigen and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor.", 
    "203": "The present findings strongly suggest that the BMSCs may enhance functional recovery by improving the neuronal integrity in the peri-infarct area, when directly transplanted into the infarct brain at clinically relevant timing. (123)I-IMZ single photon emission computed tomography may be a promising modality to scientifically prove the beneficial effects of BMSC transplantation on the host brain in clinical situation.", 
    "204": "Pathological pain states are often associated with neuronal hyperexcitability in the spinal cord. Reducing this excitability could theoretically be achieved by amplifying the existing spinal inhibitory control mediated by GABAA receptors (GABAARs). In this study, we used the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic etifoxine (EFX) to characterize its interest as pain killer and spinal mechanisms of action. EFX potentiates GABAAR function but can also increase its function by stimulating the local synthesis of 3\u03b1-reduced neurosteroids (3\u03b1NS), the most potent endogenous modulators of this receptor.", 
    "205": "The efficacy of EFX analgesia and the contribution of 3\u03b1NS were evaluated in a rat model of mononeuropathy. Spinal contribution of EFX was characterized through changes in pain symptoms after intrathecal injections, spinal content of EFX and 3\u03b1NS, and expression of FosB-related genes, a marker of long-term plasticity.", 
    "206": "We found that a 2-week treatment with EFX (>5\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) fully suppressed neuropathic pain symptoms. This effect was fully mediated by 3\u03b1NS and probably by allopregnanolone, which was found at a high concentration in the spinal cord. In good agreement, the level of EFX analgesia after intrathecal injections confirmed that the spinal cord is a privileged target as well as the limited expression of FosB/\u0394FosB gene products that are highly expressed in persistent pain states.", 
    "207": "This preclinical study shows that stimulating the production of endogenous analgesics such as 3\u03b1NS represents an interesting strategy to reduce neuropathic pain symptoms. Since EFX is already prescribed as an anxiolytic in several countries, a translation to the human clinic needs to be rapidly evaluated.", 
    "208": "Brain carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are known to modulate neuronal signalling. Using a novel CA VII (Car7) knockout (KO) mouse as well as a CA II (Car2) KO and a CA II/VII double KO, we show that mature hippocampal pyramidal neurons are endowed with two cytosolic isoforms. CA VII is predominantly expressed by neurons starting around postnatal day 10 (P10). The ubiquitous isoform II is expressed in neurons at P20. Both isoforms enhance bicarbonate-driven GABAergic excitation during intense GABAA-receptor activation. P13-14 CA VII KO mice show behavioural manifestations atypical of experimental febrile seizures (eFS) and a complete absence of electrographic seizures. A low dose of diazepam promotes eFS in P13-P14 rat pups, whereas seizures are blocked at higher concentrations that suppress breathing. Thus, the respiratory alkalosis-dependent eFS are exacerbated by GABAergic excitation. We found that CA VII mRNA is expressed in the human cerebral cortex before the age when febrile seizures (FS) occur in children. Our data indicate that CA VII is a key molecule in age-dependent neuronal pH regulation with consequent effects on generation of FS.", 
    "209": "Although the benzodiazepine exclusion policy in the U.S. Medicare Part D drug coverage program has been studied, little information is available on individual use and switching patterns between benzodiazepines and substitute medications. Patients voluntarily were continuing or stopping benzodiazepines or switching to substitute medications. These individual-level outcomes can provide information beneficial to providers and policymakers to better understand the intended and unintended consequences of exclusion policies.", 
    "210": "The objective was to determine the effect of the Medicare Part D benzodiazepine exclusion on the utilization patterns of benzodiazepines and substitute medications by a select group of Medicare beneficiaries for a year following implementation of the exclusion. This research focused on the examination of the within-person patterns of benzodiazepine use and factors associated with these patterns.", 
    "211": "A quasi-experimental, comparative study was used to analyze prescription patterns and multinomial regression models were applied to investigate factors predicting different benzodiazepine use patterns. Pharmacy dispensing data for continuously eligible Medicare beneficiaries with at least one benzodiazepine fill in 2005 were reduced to a comparison group of 216 individuals with continual coverage and an intervention group of 250 individuals who lost coverage for benzodiazepines. Four individual patients' drug use patterns, continuation, switch, fluid movement, and cessation were identified by sorting and arraying pharmacy dispensing data to apply systematic drug file review. Multinomial regression models were used to examine the impact of coverage, demographic, medical, economic, and pharmaceutical factors.", 
    "212": "Significantly more Medicare seniors who lost benzodiazepine coverage switched to potential substitute medications than those who continued to have coverage. Interestingly, 12 percent of affected seniors and 6 percent of unaffected seniors switched from and back to benzodiazepines (fluid movement). Zolpidem was the most popular substitute agent despite being an expensive brand-name drug. Regression models revealed that affected individuals had nearly two times the odds of engaging in switch-related patterns than those who had continuous coverage. Also, women were twice as likely to discontinue benzodiazepines as men.", 
    "213": "More seniors who lost benzodiazepine coverage engaged in medication switching, and women were more likely to stop benzodiazepines after the implementation of the exclusion policy.",

Records from Florida's Pregnancy Associated Mortality Review conducted between 1999 and 2005 (n = 415) were linked to 385 toxicology reports obtained from Florida medical examiners' offices. The final study sample consisted of 169 drug-positive, pregnancy-associated non-natural deaths. Of these, 86 were positive for both blood and urine, 64 were positive for blood only and five for urine only, and the remainder were positive for some other specimen. Among these deaths, 91 cases (54%) involved prescription drugs, 78 cases (46%) involved illicit drugs, and 69 cases (41%) involved alcohol. Opioids constituted the majority of deaths associated with prescription drugs. Substantial co-use of opioids and benzodiazepines was seen. Pregnant or recently pregnant women may have more interactions with healthcare providers, which may present more opportunities for intervention and prevention.",

This study describes synthesis and stereospecific comparative pharmacodynamics (PD, anticonvulsant activity and teratogenicity) and pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of four individual SPD stereoisomers. SPD stereoisomers' anticonvulsant activity was comparatively evaluated in several anticonvulsant animal models including the benzodiazepine-resistant status epilepticus (SE). SPD stereoisomers' PK-PD relationship was evaluated in rats. Teratogenicity of SPD stereoisomers was evaluated in SWV mice strain, susceptible to VPA-induced neural tube defect (NTD). SPD stereoisomers (141 or 283 mg/kg) did not cause NTD. SPD has stereoselective PK and PD. (2R,3S)-SPD and (2S,3R)-SPD higher clearance led to a 50% lower plasma exposure that may contribute to their relative lower activity in the pilocarpine-induced SE model. (2S,3S)-SPD, (2R,3R)-SPD, and racemic-SPD have similar anticonvulsant activity and a PK profile that are better than those of (2R,3S)-SPD and (2S,3R)-SPD, making them good candidates for development as new, potent antiepileptics with a potential in benzodiazepine-resistant SE.",

Outcomes assessed were seizure recurrence at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 months and at age 5 to 6 years in the intervention and non-intervention groups, and adverse medication effects. The presence of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.", 
    "221": "Thirty-six articles describing 26 randomised trials with 2740 randomised participants were included. Thirteen interventions of continuous or intermittent prophylaxis and their control treatments were analysed. Methodological quality was moderate to poor in most studies. We could not do a meta-analysis for eight of the 13 comparisons due to insufficient numbers of trials. No significant benefit for valproate, pyridoxine, intermittent phenobarbitone or ibuprofen versus placebo or no treatment was found; nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetominophen or placebo; nor for intermittent rectal diazepam versus intermittent valproate, nor phenobarbitone versus intermittent rectal diazepam. There was a significant reduction of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent oral diazepam versus placebo with a relative risk (RR) of 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.94) at 24 months), RR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.89) at 48 months, with no benefit at 6, 12 or 72 months. Phenobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment reduced seizures at 6, 12 and 24 months but not at 18 or 72 month follow up (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84 at 6 months; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.75 at 12 months; and RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.88 at 24 months). Intermittent rectal diazepam versus no treatment or placebo also reduced seizures (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.86 at 6 months; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.87 at 12 months; RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.39 at 18 months; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.71 at 36 months), with no benefit at 24 months. Intermittent clobazam compared to placebo at 6 months resulted in a RR of 0.09 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.30), an effect found against an extremely high (83.3%) recurrence rate in the controls and which is a result that needs replication. The recording of adverse effects was variable. Lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone treated children were found in two studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to some 30% of children in the phenobarbitone treated group and in up to 36% in benzodiazepine treated groups. Evidence of publication bias was found in the meta analyses of comparisons for phenobarbitone versus placebo (8 studies) at 12 months but not at 6 months (6 studies); and valproate versus placebo (4 studies) at 12 months; with too few studies to identify publication bias for the other comparisons.", 
    "222": "No clinically important benefits for children with febrile seizures were found for intermittent oral diazepam, phenytoin, phenobarbitone, intermittent rectal diazepam, valproate, pyridoxine, intermittent phenobarbitone or intermittent ibuprofen, nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetominophen or placebo. Adverse effects were reported in up to 30% of children. Apparent benefit for clobazam treatment in one recent trial needs to be replicated to be judged reliable. Given the benign nature of recurrent febrile seizures, and the high prevalence of adverse effects of these drugs, parents and families should be supported with adequate contact details of medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon."
