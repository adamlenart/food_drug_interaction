    "0": "The hypnotic and residual sedative effects of the first and seventh of seven regular night-time doses of nitrazepam 5 mg, temazepam 20 mg, and placebo were studied in 58 elderly inpatients. Plasma temazepam and nitrazepam concentrations rose by about 50% and 113% respectively between the mornings of day 1 and day 7. Patients reported sleeping well more often after the first dose of either hypnotic (p less than 0.05), but there was no difference after the seventh dose. Reaction time was unchanged on the morning after the first dose but was significantly prolonged after the seventh dose of both hypnotics (p less than 0.01). The time taken to eliminate the letter E from a page of prose tended to be prolonged after the first dose of both drugs (temazepam v placebo, p less than 0.05; nitrazepam v placebo, not significant) and was further prolonged on the morning after the seventh dose of nitrazepam (nitrazepam v placebo, p less than 0.05). Thus plasma accumulation of the drug was associated with a deterioration in daytime performance. This change in performance did not correlate with age, cerebral blood flow, or plasma concentration, but patients of low intelligence tended to be more severely affected.", 
    "1": "Benzodiazepines are widely used anxiolytic and anticonvulsant drugs, and brain receptors for these drugs have been characterized by M\u00f6hler and Okada and Squires and Braestrup. Recently, substances that antagonize benzodiazepine binding to brain receptors have been discovered. These benzodiazepine antagonists were shown to block the central effects of benzodiazepines and particularly their anticonvulsive properties. Two such antagonists, Ro 15-1788 (an imidazodiazepine) and methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), have recently been shown to have different intrinsic pharmacological properties. beta-CCM, injected into baboons, cats, mice and rats, is a convulsant, whereas Ro 15-1788 lacks such an activity. Thus, the separation of convulsant and non-convulsant antagonists has been proposed. We suggest here that a subclassification of antagonists is also valid at the behavioural level, based on a conflict model in mice. We show that Ro 15-1788 and beta-CCM antagonize the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines. In addition, we find that, when injected alone, Ro 15-1788 has no anxiogenic effects while beta-CCM has anxiogenic properties. We therefore propose that beta-CCM is an anxiogenic convulsant benzodiazepine antagonist and that Ro 15-1788 is a non-anxiogenic non-convulsant benzodiazepine antagonist.", 
    "2": "The convulsant, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (100-1000 microM) enhanced potassium-evoked release of exogenous D-aspartate from slices of rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum, but not that from slices of hippocampus. Elevation of excitant amino acid release may contribute to the convulsant action of 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Unlike the convulsant barbiturate CHEB, 3-mercaptopropionic acid did not influence protoveratrine-stimulated release of D-aspartate and its action on potassium-evoked release appeared to be not dependent on calcium ion fluxes. Several other convulsants, including bemegride (200 microM), benzodiazepine Ro-5-3663 (100 M), nikethamide (500 microM), pentylenetetrazole (500 microM), and 4,6,6-trimethylcaprolactam (100 and 500 microM), and the glutamate decarboxylase inhibitor isoniazid (500 microM) failed to influence potassium-evoked release of D-aspartate.", 
    "3": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of CA1 population spikes was elicited by cCA3 stimulation. Phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine blocked the potentiation in a dose-dependent manner while diazepam and sodium thiopental had no effect. In midcollicular-transected rats where PCP has no depressant effect on the population spike, the drug still blocked LTP.", 
    "4": "The effect of 17 days of monocular suture of eyelids of day-old chicks upon levels of neuropeptides and high affinity binding sites was studied. A significant reduction of met-enkephalin, but not of substance P or neurotensin, was observed in the retina of the eye receiving dim and unpatterned light. Retinal muscarinic, dopaminergic, opiate, and benzodiazepine receptors appeared unaltered by the experimental procedure. Levels of neuropeptides were not significantly changed in optic lobes contralateral to and innervated by the sutured eyes relative to the optic lobes receiving afferentation from the open eyes. Seventeen days after unilateral enucleation of new-hatched chicks, the neuropeptide content of the smaller denervated optic lobes did not differ from that of the lobes receiving an intact neuronal input.", 
    "5": "The discovery, in 1977, of the specific binding sites for benzodiazepines in the brain of mammals, notably in man, lends support to the possible existence of endogenous compounds acting as natural ligands of these sites. At present, more than a dozen of molecules with the capacity to displace bound [(3)H]benzodiazepines from their specific sites have been extracted from the brain of several species (rat, pig, bovine), the cerebrospinal fluid and urine of man. These molecules are proteins, peptides, purines, ?-carbolines and exhibit (some) pharmacological properties similar or opposite to those of benzodiazepines. The most recent data concerning benzodiazepine receptors suggest that the endogenous ligand would be, if it exists, a benzodiazepine-like compound (agonist) with an indolic structure.", 
    "6": "The subcutaneous implantation of an estradiol pellet (10 mg) into female rats induced a hypophyseal hyperplasia with hyperprolactinaemia. Examination of neurotransmitter receptors in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex one month after the implantation revealed that estrogenization was associated with: an increased density of (3)H-domperidone binding sites (D(2) receptors) in the striatum and reduced numbers of (3)H-serotonin high affinity sites (5-HT(1) receptors) in the hippocampus and of (3)H-muscimol binding sites (GABA receptors) in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex. In contrast, the characteristics of (3)H-spiperone binding to 5-HT(2) receptors (in the cerebral cortex) and those of (3)H-flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine sites (in the three brain regions examined) were not significantly different in estrogenized and in control female rats. However, the enhancing effect of GABA on (3)H-flunitrazepam binding was markedly reduced in brain membranes from estrogenized animals. The respective roles of estradiol and prolactin in mediating these changes in neurotransmitter receptors are discussed notably with regard to the regional heterogeneity of estradiol binding capacity in the rat brain.", 
    "7": "Some properties of muscarinic cholinoceptors and benzodiazepine receptors in selected brain regions of guinea-pigs and rats were compared under identical experimental conditions. The regions investigated were striatum, hippocampus and pons-medulla, and the properties examined were the concentrations of receptors; apparent dissociation constants of the ligands [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (for muscarinic receptors) and [(3)H]flunitrazepam (for benzodiazepine receptors); Hill coefficients for the interactions of the antagonist atropine and the agonist acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors; the affinities of these compounds for the muscarinic receptors; and the effects of chronic administration of an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor (di-isopropylfluorophosphate) on the concentrations of receptors. Rat striatal and hippocampal muscarinic receptors were found to have a slightly higher affinity for acetylcholine than the corresponding guinea-pig receptors. Administration of di-isopropylfluorophosphate reduced the concentration of muscarinic receptors in rat brain by 30%, but had no significant effect on the concentration of receptors in guinea-pig brain. In all other aspects, the properties of the brain receptors of the two species were very similar. For both species, the affinities of the muscarinic receptors for acetylcholine were higher in the pons-medulla than in the striatum and hippocampus. This was found to be the result of differences in the values of the association constants of the high- and low-affinity states of the receptors, rather than because of varying proportions of two states which have the same association constant in all regions. The insensitivity of guinea-pig brain muscarinic receptors to chronic administration of an organophosphate confirms the results of a previous study on the guinea-pig alone, and makes this system unique. Many other studies on various species have all indicated that prolonged activation of a receptor by an agonist (caused in the present work by inactivation of acetyl-cholinesterase) leads to a decrease in the concentration of the receptor.", 
    "8": "Recent in vitro studies have revealed that benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates and ethanol might influence GABA binding to CNS membrane sites. Further studies of such interactions might be helpful for explaining both the mechanisms of action of these psychoactive agents and the tolerance/dependence that might result from their continued use.", 
    "9": "Photoaffinity labeling of brain benzodiazepine-receptors with [(3)H]flunitrazepam ([(3)H]FNZ) results in the covalent linking of the ligand to [(3)H]FNZ-binding site. The major findings in benzodiazepine-receptor studies employing photoaffinity labeling are described; the covalent linking of [(3)H]FNZ is compared to its reversible binding; and a mechanism for the labeling reaction is postulated.", 
    "10": "The analytical applications of the hydrolysis of 1,4-benzodiazepines to the corresponding benzophenone derivatives are reviewed according to the analytical methods used for their final determination. The scope and limitations of the individual methods for the hydrolysis products are discussed: Colour reactions, photometry, fluorimetry, thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Published data on the kinetic parameters and mechanisms are summarized in an attempt to explain the problems involved in exploiting this reaction for analytical applications.", 
    "11": "Antibodies specific for benzodiazepines were raised in rabbits by immunization with a conjugate of a benzodiazepine derivative, Ro 7-1986/1, with bovine serum albumin. The presence of anti-Ro 7-1986/1 antibodies in the sera was demonstrated by a radioimmunoassay using the radioligand [3H]flunitrazepam ([3h]FNZ). The antibodies displayed a high-affinity for [3H]FNZ (KD = 0.073 +/- 0.003 nM) and and cross-reacted with a broad spectrum of benzodiazepine derivatives. Benzodiazepine levels in samples of sera and urine of benzodiazepine-treated humans were determined. Due to the high sensitivity of the assay only minute volumes (microliter quantities) of body fluids are employed and, therefore, no extraction of the drugs is required. Nitrazepam and diazepam levels as low as 20 picograms can be easily observed. Intoxicating levels of benzodiazepines can be detected by a single measurement in less than 10 min. This radioimmunoassay is advantageous for pharmacokinetic studies, toxicological examinations and forensic medicine due to its high sensitivity, wide-range specificity and technical simplicity.", 
    "12": "The averaged photopalpebral reflex (PPR) was bipolarly recorded from electrodes placed on the upper and lower palpebrae in male university students. In a drowsy state which was defined by the monitored EEG, the latencies of PPR were significantly prolonged and the amplitude reduced. In contrast, the latencies were shortened by immersing their hands in ice water which greatly aroused the subjects. The central stimulant, methylphenidate 10 mg, significantly shortened the latencies and diazepam 5 mg possessing anxiolytic and hypnotic actions significantly prolonged them. When the recording of PPR was repeated consecutively five times, the amplitude was easily reduced but the latencies were relatively stable. From these results, it is confirmed that the latencies of PPR are prolonged in a lowered arousal level and shortened in a more aroused state. This indicates that PPR could be a useful index to assess objectively the arousal level of humans and hence could be a useful tool for investigations of psychophysiology and psychopharmacology.", 
    "13": "The effect of phenazepam therapy in a dose of 2 mg daily on short-term memory function was studied in 58 patients with borderline neuropsychic disorders. Concomitant differential assessment of the changes observed in psychoemotional tension and psychopathological symptomatology over time was also carried out by using both clinical findings and results of psychological tests. The discrepancy found between the patients' complaints of memory deterioration following tranquilizer therapy and the absence of any signs of such an impairment as judged by the data obtained by special tests is explained by lowered levels of emotional and motivational tension. This hypothesis is substantiated by both clinical evidence and psychological data.", 
    "14": "Using anthramycin, a potent antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces refuineus, as an example, we have developed a rational model for the evolution of the capability of this microorganism to produce, tolerate and retain the genetic information needed to make this extremely potent secondary metabolite. The concepts and ideas outlined in this article have also been applied in a more general way to other antibiotics with the hope that this might stimulate research designed to test some of these concepts.", 
    "15": "Diazepam plasma binding was determined in 17 matched pairs of maternal and foetal plasma, collected at delivery. Diazepam % free was higher (p less than 0.001) in maternal (mean 3.24%) than in either umbilical venous (mean 1.50%) or umbilical arterial (mean 1.24%) plasma. The data from in vitro dialysis studies were consistent with the reported higher diazepam concentrations in infants than in mothers at delivery. Plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations were higher (p less than 0.001) in maternal (mean = 643 microM) than in matched umbilical venous plasma (means = 211 microM) and there was a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) between diazepam % free and corresponding plasma NEFA concentration for pooled data (r = 0.871, n = 34). Multiple and partial regression analysis indicates that transplacental differences in albumin, bilirubin and total protein concentrations made a minimal contribution to diazepam binding differences between mother and foetus and that approximately 76% of the variability in diazepam % free was accounted for by plasma NEFA concentration. The binding of diazepam to human serum albumin (HSA) was markedly perturbed by the presence of NEFA but not by bilirubin and there was no apparent cooperativity between bilirubin and NEFA on diazepam-HSA binding. Moreover, our findings provide further evidence that substantial differences in binding affinities exist between foetal and maternal plasma albumins.", 
    "16": "The averaged photopalpebral reflex (PPR) represents the mean of summed reflex contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscle in response to periodic photic stimuli. The latency of PPR can be used to assess a drug effect on human arousal level, since it is prolonged if there is a reduction in the arousal level of the subject. In the present study of the clinical effects of zopiclone, healthy male volunteers aged 18-22 years were given zopiclone 5 mg and 10 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg and 10 mg, or placebo, in a double-blind, cross-over design. Changes in the latencies of PPR were examined from 0.5 to 4 h after medication. Both zopiclone and nitrazepam prolonged the latency in a dose-dependent manner, but the prolongation induced by zopiclone appeared more rapidly, was slightly more marked and lasted for a shorter period than that induced by nitrazepam. Zopiclone produced slightly fewer subjective changes, such as vagueness of thought and weakness, than did nitrazepam. From these results, it is suggested that zopiclone possesses a potent hypnotic action which appears more rapidly and is slightly more potent and shorter lasting than that of nitrazepam. In addition, zopiclone may also exhibit fewer side effects, such as vagueness of thought and weakness than nitrazepam, and it may cause less \"hang over\".", 
    "17": "Anaesthesia with continuous i.v. ketamine and 65% nitrous oxide in oxygen was given to a total of 49 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. A control group was premedicated with atropine and other groups received in addition rectal diazepam or clorazepate i.v. For further patients had been on oral diazepam or barbiturates for 1-14 years; as premedication they received atropine alone. The anaesthetic technique gave good operative conditions in the 4 groups of patients. The haemodynamic stimulation of ketamine was significantly reduced in patients premedicated with diazepam. Psychotomimetic side effects were not prominent in any of the groups. Patients premedicated with diazepam required a lower rate of ketamine infusion as compared to controls during the initial 30 min of anaesthesia. The patients in the other groups did not differ from the control group in this respect. There were large differences in metabolic pattern between the groups. As compared to the controls, the patients on long-term diazepam or barbiturates had high concentrations of hydroxylated metabolites, with levels higher than that of norketamine. The patients pretreated with diazepam had very low plasma levels of hydroxylated metabolites. Clorazepate premedication did not significantly affect the metabolism of ketamine. The biological half-life of ketamine was significantly increased in the diazepam-treated group, and it was shortened in those on long term treatment with barbiturates or diazepam.", 
    "18": "Three personal observations of \"eating seizures' are described and similar cases in the literature considered. The authors conclude that eating seizures represent an unusual pathological event with complex physiopathological mechanisms, and prognosis may change in relation to the different clinical contexts. The role of intermittent prophylactic treatment with clobazam is discussed.", 
    "19": "The anticonvulsant effect of either clonazepam (0.2-6.4 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (2.5-40 mg/kg) alone or in combination with diphenylhydantoin (4-16 mg/kg) was studied against electroconvulsions in mice. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally, diphenylhydantoin - 75 min and the benzodiazepines - 60 min before the test. Adding either clonazepam or chlordiazepoxide (in doses moderately increasing the convulsive threshold) was more effective than doubling the dose of diphenylhydantoin. Both the interaction between benzodiazepines and diphenylhydantoin at the level of the receptor for picrotoxin-barbiturates and benzodiazepine-induced potentiation of specific diphenylhydantoin binding are likely to contribute to the observed phenomenon. On the other hand, a diphenylhydantoin-induced increase in the total number of specific benzodiazepine binding sites seems of minor importance since clonazepam (with a high affinity for these sites) and chlordiazepoxide (with a low affinity) were equipotent in the enhancement of the combined treatment efficacy.", 
    "20": "Chromosomal preparations were examined for structural and numerical abnormalities induced by chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) in mice which received either a single oral dose (20 mg/kg) or multiple doses (10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) for time-response and dose-response studies, respectively. The sampling was done at different post-treatment hours. The structural aberrations recorded were mostly of the chromatid type. CDZ induced a significant increase in chromosomal aberration frequencies at all sampling hours with a peak at 32 h post-treatment. In dose-response studies all the dose groups showed a significant increase over controls but the effect was maximum at the lowest dose level.", 
    "21": "1 Peak saccadic velocity of horizontal eye movements, saccade duration at 30 degrees of amplitude and saccade reaction time were measured in six drug free male subjects. 2 In two separate experiments, intravenous doses of diazepam (5 mg), lorazepam (2 mg), chlordiazepoxide (25 mg) and placebo were given, and eye movement recordings were made before and at frequent intervals after drug administration. 3 All the benzodiazepines produced a significant impairment of peak saccadic velocity and saccade duration. Only lorazepam significantly affected saccade reaction time. 4 Time to achieve maximum effect was 10 min after diazepam, 29 min after lorazepam and 42 min after chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "22": "Midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) was compared to thiopental (4.0 mg/kg) for possible interactions with succinylcholine or pancuronium when used for induction of anesthesia. Neuromuscular function was monitored by recording the force of thumb adduction in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. Following induction of anesthesia with either midazolam (N = 10) or thiopental (N = 10), stable muscle-twitch tension was obtained and succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) was given intravenously. The duration of blockade, recovery time, intensity of fasciculations, or adequacy of relaxation for tracheal intubation did not differ between patients receiving midazolam or thiopental. An additional group of patients anesthetized and monitored in the same manner received pancuronium (0.025 mg/kg) in incremental doses until a 99% depression of muscle-twitch tension was obtained. Dose-response curves for pancuronium, duration of blockade, and adequacy of relaxation for tracheal intubation did not differ between patients receiving midazolam (N = 10) or thiopental (N = 10). We conclude that the neuromuscular blockade produced by succinylcholine or pancuronium was no different in patients receiving either midazolam or thiopental for induction of anesthesia.", 
    "23": "Twenty-two healthy volunteers aged 20-78 years received single 5-mg doses of diazepam by intravenous injection, by mouth in the fasting state, and by a deltoid intramuscular injection. The kinetic profile of diazepam by each route was determined from multiple plasma diazepam concentrations measured 7-14 days after each dose. After intravenous injection, diazepam volume of distribution (Vd) was larger in women than in men, but increased with age regardless of sex. Elimination half-life was longer in elderly than in young men (101 v 32 h, P less than 0.025), partly due to the increased Vd as well as to a significant reduction in total metabolic clearance (0.24 v 0.46 ml/min/kg, P less than 0.05). However, the prolonged half-life in elderly as opposed to young women (99 v 44 h; P less than .01) was due mainly to increased Vd because clearance was not significantly changed (0.29 v 0.35 ml/min/kg). In all subjects, oral diazepam was rapidly absorbed; peak plasma levels were reached an average of 0.9 h after dosage. Absolute bioavailability averaged 94%, indicating essentially complete absorption. Neither age nor sex significantly influenced oral absorption. In all male subjects, and in 8 of 12 women, absorption of diazepam after deltoid intramuscular injection was rapid and essentially complete. However, in three young and one elderly women, absorption was slower and apparently incomplete. Age as such did not significantly influence absorption of intramuscular diazepam.", 
    "24": "Depression is common in the geriatric population, but recovery rates are gratifying. Safe treatment requires attention to the effects of aging on pharmacokinetics and close monitoring. Antidepressants are the drugs most commonly used; to the standard tricyclic drugs have now been added a tetracyclic and a triazolopyridine. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and lithium are second-choice options; a benzodiazepine is not generally required. Dosages should be lower than conventionally prescribed. Side effects of antidepressant drugs are common, the most important being slowing of cardiac conduction times and the most common being anticholinergic manifestations, such as dry mouth and tachycardia. Some of the more recently introduced antidepressants may have more advantageous side-effect profiles than the older agents.", 
    "25": "The behavioral effects of the antipsychotic drug, clozapine, were compared with those of thioridazine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide. Behavior of squirrel monkeys was controlled by different consequences of a lever-pressing response (presentation of food, presentation of electric shock or termination of a stimulus associated with electric shock) under different schedules of reinforcement (a fixed-interval schedule or a multiple schedule with alternating fixed-ratio and fixed-interval components). The effects of thioridazine (0.2-24.6 mumol/kg), chlorpromazine (0.03-2.8 mumol/kg) and haloperidol (0.001-0.08 mumol/kg) were largely independent of the type of schedule or the type of consequent event that maintained responding: each drug produced dose-related decreases in responding under all conditions in which they were studied. Clozapine (0.1-9.2 mumol/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (0.9-167.4 mumol/kg) also only decreased responding under most schedule conditions; however, intermediate doses of either drug markedly increased responding maintained by presentation of food under the fixed-interval schedule (whether programmed singly or as a component of the multiple schedule). Only clozapine increased responding maintained by presentation of electric shock under the fixed-interval schedule. Thus, the behavioral effects of clozapine differed qualitatively from those of representative antipsychotic and antianxiety drugs.", 
    "26": "A random sample of claimants under Manitoba's Pharmacare plan provided information on the drugs prescribed for those individuals who spent more than $50 for drugs in 1978. More women than men were represented among the 412 claimants aged 50 to 64 (58% females), and more drugs were prescribed for women than men (8.38 +/- 3.4 vs. 7.17 +/- .33, mean +/- S.E.M., p less than 0.02). For the 403 claimants aged 65 and older, the sex distribution matched that of the general population (55%), and the difference in number of drugs prescribed was not statistically significant (8.49 +/- .36 vs 7.98 +/- .35). For the claimants aged 65 and older, the five most heavily prescribed drug categories were thiazide-type diuretics (prescribed for 51.6% of older claimants in 1978), benzodiazepines (40.0%), salicylates (26.8%), digoxin (22.6%) and codeine (20.8%). There were few differences in prescription frequencies between younger and older claimants, and these data indicate that drugs prescribed for heavy drug users do not change markedly as a function of age.", 
    "27": "Binding of L-tryptophan, diazepam, salicylate and Phenol Red to defatted human serum albumin was studied by ultrafiltration at pH 7.0. All ligands bind to one high-affinity binding site with association constants of the order of 10(4)-10(5)M-1. The number of secondary binding sites was found to vary from zero to five, with association constants about 10(3)M-1. Competitive binding studies with different pairs of the ligands were performed. Binding of both ligands was determined simultaneously. L-Tryptophan and diazepam were found to compete for a common high-affinity binding site on albumin. The following combinations of ligands do not bind competitively to albumin: L-tryptophan-Phenol Red, L-tryptophan-salicylate and Phenol Red-salicylate. On the other hand, high-affinity bindings of the three ligands do not take place independently but in such a way that binding of one of the ligands results in a decrease in binding of the other ligands. The decreases in binding are reciprocal and can be accounted for by introducing a coupling constant. The magnitude of the constant is dependent on the ligands being bound. In the present study, the mutual decrease in binding was more pronounced with L-tryptophan-salicylate and Phenol Red-salicylate than with L-tryptophan-Phenol Red.", 
    "28": "This study characterized the interoceptive discriminative stimulus (IDS) produced by a small dose of cocaine. Rats were trained to use a dose of cocaine of 1.25 mg/kg vs saline as the basis for choosing one of two levers for food reinforcement on a fixed ratio 10 schedule. The discrimination was acquired over approx. 60 training sessions. d-Amphetamine generalized to cocaine with approximately equal potency (ED50's for cocaine and d-amphetamine were 0.07 and 0.06 mg/kg, respectively); 20 mg/kg cocaine and 10 mg/kg methylphenidate also generalized to the cocaine lever. Pentylenetetrazol, 20 mg/kg, did not generalize to the cocaine lever, and diazepam, 10 mg/kg, did not block the 1.25 mg/kg cocaine discrimination. These data indicate that when a small dose of cocaine is used as the basis of discrimination training, the discriminative stimulus that it produces is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that produced by small doses of amphetamine, is still discriminated with a large dose of cocaine, and is dissimilar to the discriminative stimulus produced by pentylenetetrazol.", 
    "29": "A series of experiments are reported in all of which the effects of chronic (14-18 days) diazepam treatment on body weight were evaluated under various conditions, and one experiment in which weight gain and daily food intake were monitored simultaneously. The effect of diazepam treatment on body weight was compared to that of vehicle treatment in the following groups: (1) young adult females, (2) pregnant females, (3) shock treated young males (4) nonshocked young males. The effect of diazepam treatment on prenatally diazepam exposed and nonexposed males and females was investigated at seven months of age. Food intake was also measured during chronic diazepam and vehicle treatment. The findings show consistent and reliable differences between diazepam and vehicle treatment. Diazepam treated animals eat less in the long run and gain less weight than vehicle treated controls. Prenatal exposure to diazepam enhances the effect of diazepam treatment in adulthood.", 
    "30": "The rate and extent of accumulation of clobazam and its major metabolite, desmethylclobazam, during multiple dosage with clobazam were evaluated in 4 similarly sized groups of young male, young female, elderly male, and elderly female volunteers. Subjects received single 10mg doses of clobazam daily for 22 consecutive days. Plasma levels were measured during and after the period of dosage. Compared with the young male subjects, elderly males had slower rates of clobazam accumulation and washout, higher steady-state plasma levels, and lower steady-state clearance. Accumulation of desmethylclobazam also was slower and more extensive in the elderly male group. Among females, however, age-related kinetic differences did not approach significance. Among all subjects, pharmacokinetic variables for clobazam determined in a previous single-dose study were highly consistent with the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profile. Single-dose vs post-multiple dosage half-life, single-dose vs steady-state clearance, observed vs predicted accumulation ratios, and observed vs predicted steady-state plasma concentrations were all highly correlated, with regression line slopes close to unity. Thus, reduced single-dose clearance of clobazam in elderly men leads to slower and more extensive accumulation during multiple dosage. The single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of clobazam is highly predictive of drug behaviour during repeated dosage, suggesting that clobazam kinetics are dose- and concentration-independent within the range studied, and that self-induction or inhibition of clearance is not evident during 3 weeks of dosage.", 
    "31": "Indoprofen, a new-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, binds to human serum albumin in an endothermic reaction at low degrees of saturation and with an exothermic reaction at higher drug to protein ratios. Although indoprofen appears to bind to the same primary site as diazepam, dialysis studies show an increased binding of both drugs in the presence of the other. This novel observation is probably due to the effect of the drugs on the N leads to B conformational change of human serum albumin.", 
    "32": "High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods have been developed for the analysis of benzodiazepines, some of their metabolites and for acetaminophen in post mortem blood. The methods include a single-step extraction and the use of internal standards for quantitation. Two different columns, mu-Bondapack C18 and mu-Bondapak phenyl with two different mobile phases are described. The methods presented are sensitive, reproducible, relatively selective, and have been used regularly in forensic toxicological analysis.", 
    "33": "A preliminary investigation was undertaken to determine the feasibility of monitoring saliva levels of drugs for forensic purposes. Single oral doses of the title compounds were administered to healthy volunteers. Plasma and saliva levels were measured and ratios calculated for all drugs except diazepam. Saliva/plasma ratios for methaqualone, diphenhydramine and secobarbital were all less than one and reasonably consistent between collection times and subjects. The saliva/plasma ratios for codeine were more variable, but always greater than one. Although more detailed investigation is necessary, saliva may be a useful medium for forensic monitoring of drug ingestion.", 
    "34": "Middle-latency responses (MLR) in humans were studied using an unconventional recording technique with wide bandpass filters. Such filtering permitted simultaneous recording of the auditory brain stem response (ABR) thus facilitating comparisons between the two responses. Effects of sedation (chloral hydrate and diazepam), stimulus-related properties and the coronal distribution of MLRs were examined. Mild sedatives did not appear to affect either MLRs or ABRs. MLRs differed from ABRs in their stimulus-related properties, implying that the neuronal mechanisms underlying their generation are not the same. The amplitude of the MLR component, Pa, was largest at the vertex and symmetrically distributed over the temporal lobes. MLR components Na and Pa and ABR wave V were reliably obtained in all subjects at moderate and high stimulus intensities. At low stimulus levels, however, the detectability of wave V was more robust than the middle-latency components. Thus ABR appears to be the test of choice when hearing sensitivity is in question. MLRs are likely to be most clinically useful in patients with neurological or central auditory processing disorders.", 
    "35": "Both our personal experience and the findings of others indicate that the benzodiazepines (a) are the drugs of first choice for control of status epilepticus occurring in patients with primary generalized epilepsy (90%-100% effective) or control of hemiclonic convulsions in children without brain lesions, (b) are effective in approximately 60% of cases of status epilepticus occurring in partial epilepsy, (c) are effective in only 15% to 59% of cases of tonic status or various types of absence status occurring in secondary generalized epilepsy (but no other drug is more effective), (d) are helpful in status epilepticus occurring in nonepileptic patients if there is no overt brain lesion (but give only temporary relief when status is the result of a severe organic brain lesion), and (e) are generally safe drugs.", 
    "36": "A study has been made of how the chronic administration of caffeine, d-amphetamine, imipramine and diazepam affect rat behaviour in four successive trials in which the contingency for food delivery was switched from one lever where responses were previously reinforced to the other lever where responses had no programmed consequences (reversal). A complete extinction in the first reversal was obtained with diazepam 0.3 mg/kg/day. Caffeine (6 and 18 mg/kg/day) had no effect in the first reversal and damaged rat performance in the successive reversals. Imipramine (0.6 and 4 mg/kg/day) had the same effect but only in the fourth reversal. Amphetamine (0.16 and 0.7 mg/kg/day) caused a clear damage of rat performance only in the third and fourth reversals.", 
    "37": "The effects of meperidine, normeperidine, morphine, pentobarbital and d-methadone were determined on the key-pecking behavior of pigeons responding under a multiple fixed-ratio (FR), fixed-interval (FI) schedule of grain presentation. Dose-effect curves were obtained for each drug alone and during daily administration of 10 mg/kg of diazepam. The daily administration of diazepam had little effect on the behavior itself. Meperidine and normeperidine caused dose-related decreases in both FI and FR responding. The dose-effect curves for these drugs during daily administration of diazepam were shifted to the right compared to the dose-effect curves determined in the absence of daily diazepam. In contrast, the effects of morphine, d-methadone and pentobarbital either were not affected by daily administration of diazepam or were shifted to the left by daily administration of diazepam. These data further support the hypothesis that the behavioral effects of meperidine and normeperidine are due to a proconvulsive action produced by these drugs. In contrast, the effects of morphine, d-methadone and pentobarbital are not due to such a proconvulsive action.", 
    "38": "One group of pigeons (n = 5) was trained to discriminate between the effects induced by 5.6 mg/kg of diazepam (DZP) and the vehicle whereas other pigeons (n = 5) had to discriminate between 3.0 g/kg of ethanol (ETOH) and the vehicle, administered intragastrically (IG) 10 and 40 min prior to the training sessions respectively. Once trained, the pigeons were tested with either diazepam or ethanol alone and in combination. The birds trained to discriminate between DZP and the vehicle mostly performed non-drug associated responses when tested with ETOH (0.56 to 3.0 g/kg). Tests with other doses of DZP (0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg) in the diazepam-trained birds resulted in an ED50 value of 1.4 mg/kg. The birds trained to discriminate between ETOH and the vehicle generalized DZP to ETOH, the ED50 value for diazepam being 3.0 mg/kg. Tests with other doses of ETOH (0.56 to 2.0 g/kg) in this latter group resulted in an ED50 value of 1.3 g/kg. Tests with combinations of DZP and ETOH produced a shift of the dose-response curves to the left indicating drug additivity. The discrimination of 5.6 mg/kg of IG administered DZP but not that of ETOH (3.0 g/kg) was attenuated by injections of the analeptic bemegride (ED50 = 5.5 mg/kg), thus suggesting a difference in the cueing processes of the two drugs. When tested singly, bemegride induced non-drug responding or complete suppression of responding in the birds at the doses of 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg respectively. In conclusion, the discriminable effects of DZP and ETOH are additive or even supra-additive, but the stimulus properties of the two drugs are not identical.", 
    "39": "Diazepam (1 mg/kg) was more effective than diphenylhydantoin (100 mg/kg) in suppressing motor seizures elicited in kindled rats by amygdaloid stimulation; however, the effect of these drugs on the incidence of spontaneous motor seizures in rats kindled by amygdaloid stimulation was just the opposite. At the same doses, diphenylhydantoin effectively suppressed spontaneous motor seizures, but diazepam did not. This double dissociation suggests the need for caution in drawing inferences concerning spontaneously recurring seizures from studies of elicited seizures.", 
    "40": "Anxiolytics specifically increase the number of exploratory transitions in a two-chambered model system for anxiety in mice. Characterization of parameters to optimize and standardize this model required analysis of multiple use of test animals, intertrial interval, and circadian variability. Time of day did not affect exploratory activity in mice treated with vehicle or diazepam between 10 a.m. and 11 p.m. Intertrial intervals of 1, 3, 5, or 7 days were equally effective. The diazepam-induced increase in exploratory activity was significant over the first three uses of test animals. These data recommend reuse of mice to a maximum of three trials, throughout the daytime or evening hours of their lighting schedule.", 
    "41": "Drug abuse patterns are examined for 326,611 males and females who abused drugs and were treated at a hospital emergency room or died. The data reveal a marked percentage difference between male and female mentions of heroin, PCP, and diazepam. A significantly larger proportion of females than males indicated their motivation for drug abuse to be a suicide attempt or gesture. Diazepam, alcohol-in-combination, and aspirin are the most frequently mentioned drugs by those whose motivation is suicidal. However, the percentage difference between males and females for these three drugs is less than 6%. The data were collected during the years 1976-1979.", 
    "42": "Diazepam (Valium/Roche), a benzodiazepine derivative, reversibly inhibited the spreading of chick embryo fibroblasts in a dose-related manner. This inhibition was accompanied by: 1 Fewer and less organized microfilament bundles. 2 A reduction in myosin fluorescence along these structures. 3 A reduction in the total myosin content of cells compared to corresponding controls. Overall results suggest that myosin plays an active role in the spreading of chick embryo fibroblasts.", 
    "43": "The cardiovascular effects of midazolam (0.15 mg kg-1) and thiopentone (3.0 mg kg-1) were compared during induction of anaesthesia in 20 American Society of Anesthesiologists class III patients. In patients given thiopentone (N = 11), cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance all decreased significantly over the course of the study period; mean right atrial pressure rose slightly, and stroke volume remained the same. Patients receiving midazolam (N = 9) experienced similar haemodynamic changes which were significant relative to baseline only for the fall in mean arterial pressure and the rise in mean right atrial pressure at ten minutes. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Midazolam thus appears to be at least as acceptable an induction agent as thiopentone in ill patients, from a haemodynamic point of view.", 
    "44": "1 Forty patients have been reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) because of convulsions occurring during treatment with mianserin, suggesting that this drug is more epileptogenic than tricyclic antidepressants. 2 Details concerning 83% of these cases were obtained in a questionnaire study carried out in collaboration with the CSM and compared with those of a control group. 3 Ratings of the relationship between drug and effect carried out by neurologists and J.G.E. showed considerable variations and confidence of a causal connection in only a minority of patients. 4 As the CSM data do not allow for a reliable assessment of the relative epileptogenic effects of antidepressants, a comparison has been made between unpublished work on seizures occurring during treatment with imipramine and amitriptyline and published research on mianserin. This suggests that mianserin is no more epileptogenic than tricyclic antidepressants. 5 Factors that might predispose to seizures include relevant family and past medical history, starting treatment, a change in dose, benzodiazepine withdrawal and concomitant treatment with other drugs that have epileptogenic properties.", 
    "45": "Rectal premedication with atropine and diazepam and rectal induction of anaesthesia with ketamine have been used in 30 healthy children undergoing minor surgery. The anticholinergic and sedative effects of the premedication were satisfactory. Induction of anaesthesia was smooth with no adverse circulatory or respiratory effects. No psychotomimetic side-effects were seen, and analgesia persisted into the recovery period. Plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were measured in eight children and revealed a pharmacokinetic pattern indicating comparatively low bioavailability probably due to incomplete absorption from the rectum and a high 'first-pass' metabolism. The technique of rectal administration of ketamine needs further pharmacokinetic evaluation before it can be generally recommended.", 
    "46": "This experiment was designed to determine whether or not the stronger effect of anticonvulsants on cortex than on amygdala focal seizures was due to a greater elevation of cortex seizure threshold. The effects of several doses of carbamazepine, clonazepam, and phenytoin were examined on the threshold for electrically induced afterdischarge in amygdala and cortex in 71 rats. All three drugs were found to be effective in increasing the seizure threshold with greater effects being produced in the cortex than in the amygdala. Carbamazepine produced the largest threshold increase in both foci, and clonazepam produced the weakest effects. These data are comparable to previous data on drug action against focal or partial seizures, and suggest that anticonvulsants may control partial attacks through their action on the local seizure threshold. This theory of anticonvulsant drug action adds to the common belief that carbamazepine and phenytoin act primarily by blocking seizure spread.", 
    "47": "Conventional preparations of diazepam for i.v. use contain solvents which cause pain on injection and thrombophlebitis in a high percentage of cases. However, diazepam can be dissolved with advantage in the oleaginous phase of an oil-in-water emulsion (Diazemuls). Diazemuls has been given to 9492 patients without serious side-effects. Following i.v. injection, 2435 patients were studied with respect to pain and clinical effect. Only 0.4% experienced pain. The intended clinical effect was recorded in 99% of the patients. I.m. injection of Diazemuls resulted in a significantly smaller frequency of pain in connection with the injection than did the injection of Valium (7% and 43% respectively). Pharmacokinetic studies have been made after i.v. and i.m. injection of Diazemuls and Valium. The distribution and elimination phases after i.v. injection were the same with both forms. Thus the drug probably quickly separates from the oil particles of the emulsion after injection. After i.m. administration, the plasma concentration shows a wide spread with both preparations. A brief survey of other substances tested in emulsion form is presented.", 
    "48": "The circadian change of gastric acidity was studied in 9 patients and 2 controls. Five patients were treated with gastrozepin, two with vicalin and buscolysin, two with biomet according to a schedule. Gastric content was aspirated at fixed intervals and pH determined separately of each portion. The data were juxtaposed to those of the gastric probe prior to the beginning of the treatment. They revealed that with the treatment with gastrozepin and biomet, the lowest pH values during the day were higher, with a statisticall significance, than those obtained at basal conditions prior to the treatment. During the night, pH over 3 was observed only in the treatment with biomet. The methodical conditions used ate suitable both for clinical-pharmacological investigations and for individualization of the treatment of some patients that failed to respond to the ordinary therapeutic combinations.", 
    "49": "The effects of repeated oral doses of pirenzepine (100 mg daily for 7 days) and antacid (Maalox, 105 ml daily for 7 days) on the test-meal-stimulated release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were evaluated in 7 duodenal ulcer outpatients by means of a randomized cross-over study, with a wash-out period of one week between pirenzepine and antacid administration. The effects of pirenzepine (100 mg daily for 7 days) were also evaluated in 5 healthy adult volunteers. The stimulus test was performed on each fasting patient two days before the treatment started and after a 7-day treatment. Venous blood samples were obtained before the test meal (basal) and 3, 10 and 30 minutes after it. Plasma PP levels were estimated by means of a specific RIA. The results obtained showed that pirenzepine significantly inhibits the PP response to the test meal in the duodenal ulcer patients and in the healthy volunteers. The above-mentioned effects suggest that one of the mechanisms of action on the therapeutic activity of pirenzepine on peptic ulcer might be explained by the preservation of pancreatic secretion unimpaired by an increase in PP release after meal stimulus.", 
    "50": "The acute effects of intravenous injection of cimetidine and pirenzepine on plasma iPTH and CT were studied in seven patients on chronic haemodialysis and seven healthy controls. As expected, the resting iPTH and CT levels were significantly higher in patients on RDT than in the healthy subjects. Both drugs decreased to a similar extent the increased plasma iPTH in the patients, but neither was able entirely to normalize the elevated level. The CT concentration in the patients on haemodialysis was significantly decreased by cimetidine but was only moderately reduced by pirenzepine. As neither drug was able to normalize the elevated PTH level in patients on chronic dialysis, it can be assumed that neither used alone would improve signs and symptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism.", 
    "51": "The present study was performed with the aim of establishing whether the muscarinic-receptor antagonist pirenzepine impairs liver blood flow, as previously observed for H2-blockers. For this purpose, two different doses of pirenzepine (0.3 and 0.6 mg/100 g b.w. respectively) were administered to two groups of rats. Liver plasma flow was measured 30 min after treatment by the new sorbitol clearance test which is simple and does not require hepatic vein catheterization. The results were compared with those obtained in a control group and in a group treated with cimetidine. It was shown that, compared to the control group in which the observed functional liver plasma flow was 5.0 +/- 1.3 ml/min/100 g b.w. (MV +/- SD), rats treated with either dose of pirenzepine showed no significant impairment of liver perfusion. On the other hand, cimetidine treatment produced a significant reduction (p less than 0.001) of functional liver plasma flow. Our results show that pirenzepine treatment does not significantly impair liver functional activity through reduced liver perfusion. They also suggest that muscarinic receptors are probably not involved in the control of splanchnic blood flow.", 
    "52": "Serum gastrin was studied before meals in 71 patients with duodenal ulcer, treated with various doses of simetidin and pyrensepin. Gastrin level was elevated after a treatment with 1 g simetidin daily and 125 mg pyrensepin, and remained unchanged with pyrensepin treatment (50 and 100 mg daily). A tendency to decreased gastrin level was observed after the treatment with simetidin 400 mg daily. Under those circumstances the attempt at duodenal ulcer treatment with lower simetidin doses, than the usual, is justified.", 
    "53": "The effects of pirenzepine, a new anti-ulcer drug, have been examined on acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contractions of the guinea-pig isolated ileum, rat colon, rainbow lizard rectum, and chick isolated oesophagus. Pirenzepine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), like atropine (2.5 x 10(-10)-10(-6) M) competitively blocked the contractile effects of acetylcholine on all the isolated gastrointestinal tract smooth muscles examined. The pA2 values for pirenzepine and atropine against acetylcholine on all the muscle preparations were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05). It is concluded that the anti-ulcer action of pirenzepine might be due, at least in part, to its (anticholinergic) muscarinic cholinoceptor blocking activity.", 
    "54": "The elimination kinetics of antipyrine have been established under basal environmental conditions in 6 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of antipyrine in serum were measured by a relatively fast high-pressure liquid chromatography method using a radial-compression chromatographic system. Pretreatment of the subjects with therapeutic doses of pirenzepine over 5 days had no significant effect on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of antipyrine. These results suggest that pirenzepine is free of the inhibition of the hepatic mixed function oxidase system produced by cimetidine.", 
    "55": "In gross behavioral observation the minimum effective dose of zopiclone was intravenously 0.06-0.25 mg/kg and intragastrically 1-4 mg/kg in rhesus monkeys. Zopiclone suppressed barbital withdrawal signs of rhesus monkeys at a single dose of 16 mg/kg or more. The suppressing effect of zopiclone 32 mg/kg i.g. was comparable to diazepam 8 mg/kg. Crab-eating monkeys treated with zopiclone at doses up to 32 mg/kg twice daily for up to 8 weeks manifested intermediate-grade signs upon withdrawal (i.e., less severe than after treatment with diazepam and similar to nitrazepam). Zopiclone was self-administered by rhesus monkeys relatively frequently by the intravenous route; the infrequent intragastric rate was similar to or slightly higher than with diazepam.", 
    "56": "Rats lesioned in the septal nuclei display a dramatic syndrome characterized by hypoactivity in a novel environment, but exaggerated behavioural and corticosterone responses to environmental stimuli. These abnormal responses are normalized 2 hours following 15 mg/kg i.p. of chlordiazepoxide (Seggie, CCNP, 1980). The present study was undertaken to map the dose and time response characteristics of this effect and see if behaviour and corticosterone respond in parallel fashion. Chlordiazepoxide in doses of 7.5-30 mg/kg affected the hyperreactivity of septal rats is a 'U' shaped function without affecting the behaviour of non-lesioned rats. Corticosterone levels in non-lesioned rats were unaffected by chlordiazepoxide, while drug treated septal rats had corticosterone levels undistinguishable from non-lesioned control rats. The drug effects were transitory, maximal at 2 hours after injection, but absent as 48 hours after injection. General abnormalities of behaviour and corticosterone responsiveness were altered in parallel fashion by the drug, but some evidence of differences in sensitivity to the effect of the drug were noticed. Locomotion, was unaffected by the drug in lesioned and non-lesioned rats. The possibility of a GABA mechanism underlying the abnormalities of responsiveness, but not activity in septal rats is discussed.", 
    "57": "Rats subjected to non-noxious, anxiogenic stressors were found to exhibit either hyperthermia or hypothermia depending on the nature of the stressor. The present work examines the effects of naloxone (Nx), diazepam (DZP) and gamma-acetylenic GABA (AcG), an inhibitor of GABA catabolism, on these phenomena. Nx reduced stress hyperthermia and basal temperature by similar amounts; it did not affect stress hypothermia. DZP also reduced basal Tb but was able to completely inhibit and even reverse stress hyperthermia and to reduce stress hypothermia. The effects of AcG were similar to those of DZP. In conclusion, it appears that endogenous opioids are not involved in the thermic responses to our emotional stressors whereas GABA would be an important modulator. It is suggested that DZP, through a GABAergic link might inhibit the release of hyperthermic pituitary factors from the neurointermediate lobe and of hypothermic substances from the anterior lobe.", 
    "58": "The partition coefficient, pK-values and the angle of twist of the 5-phenyl ring of 65 5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones were experimentally determined. Linear regression models were applied to examine existing additivity rules. The experimental and calculated values are mostly in good agreement. Systematic deviations confirm that, with the models commonly used, some of the substituent effects are not fully accounted for.", 
    "59": "A clinical-experimental investigation was carried out in 14 healthy male test-subjects, according to a randomized double-blind cross-over design, in which the sedative and tranquillizing effects of two different oxazepam formulations were studied, with EEG examinations and psychometric tests. An adequate effect was observed with both formulations, with the same oxazepam dose. There were slight differences in the drug-EEG profiles, indicating a more rapid onset of action and a somewhat longer-lasting effect of oxazepam (Sigacalm) up to the 6th h after ingestion, in comparison with the standard form. Neither formulation leads to any psychometrically measurable loss of performance, but slight differences are observed in the increased performance induced by exercise: from the 2nd to the 6th h after ingestion it is slightly less with the trial preparation than with the standard form. Side effects were observed with neither formulation. The differences in the EEG quantification after administration o the two products are probably due to differences in the absorption and distribution of the two different galenical formulations.", 
    "60": "The relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of two oxazepam preparations were evaluated in 12 normal volunteers by a newly developed HPLC-method. After oral application of one tablet of the test (Noctazepam) and reference preparation, respectively, no statistically significant differences of the AUC, Cmax Tmax and t1/2 were found. As compared to the reference preparation the relative bioavailability of the test preparation as 110%; both preparations are therefore bioequivalent.", 
    "61": "The anticonvulsant profile of N-[beta-[4-(beta-phenylethyl)phenyl]-beta-hydroxyethyl]imidazole hydrochloride (denzimol, Rec 15-1533) has been evaluated in mice, rats and rabbits in comparison with some standard antiepileptic drugs. Denzimol suppressed electrically and chemically induced tonic seizures but did not prevent the clonic ones. In mice and rabbits the anticonvulsant activity of denzimol against maximal electroshock seizures was almost equal to that of phenytoin and phenobarbital with more rapid onset of action, whereas in rats the compound resulted in being the most potent and the less toxic one showing a longer duration of anticonvulsant activity than phenytoin. In the maximal pentetrazol seizures test in rats denzimol showed a profile similar to that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, but different from that of barbiturates and benzodiazepines so that it is suggested that its clinical application would be that of \"grand mal\" and psychomotor type seizures therapy.", 
    "62": "Acylated derivatives 4-6 of 2-aminomethylene-4-phenyl-1H-tetrahydro-6-azabenzo-1,5-diazepine 3, and carbonyl derivatives 7-10 of 6-azabenzo-1,5-diazepines were obtained. They did not display any particular pharmacological activity in screening tests: 2 exerted a weak hypotensive action and 8 possessed negligible anticonvulsant properties.", 
    "63": "1. The modifications of rat behaviour caused by imipramine, amitriptyline, doxepin, amphetamine, chlorpromazine, caffeine and diazepam were studied. 2. The schedule of reinforcement was changed from a fixed ratio to a fixed interval schedule. 3. All the studied drugs caused a depression of the rat behaviour but only tricyclic antidepressants and caffeine caused virtually no damage to the ability of the animal to adapt its behaviour to the new experimental situation.", 
    "64": "Dissociation is produced by injections of phenazepam (a benzodiazepine tranquilizer) before daily sessions of rat learning in a T-maze. The drinking reflex is seen only after the administration of benzodiazepine. The dissociation depth is linked with the dose of phenazepam: the higher the dose the more pronounced dissociation. Besides, it depends on the time between the administration of phenazepam and the reflex registration. One may assume that learning in the presence of phenazepam gives rise to new interrelations that form the basis for a new functional system which warrants the activity with the drug in the body.", 
    "65": "1 alpha-Flupenthixol (alpha-FPT)-induced catalepsy in the rat was potentiated by diaminobutyric acid (DABA), an inhibitor of the neuronal high affinity uptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). 2 The depletion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) abolished the DABA potentiation of alpha-FPT-induced catalepsy; this response was restored with 5-hydroxytryptophan. 3 Potentiation of alpha-FPT-induced catalepsy by clonazepam was significantly reduced by methysergide. Conversely, the potentiation of catalepsy by clomipramine was significantly reduced by picrotoxin. 4 These results are interpreted as evidence supporting a role for 5-HT in modifying the GABA-ergic inhibition of dopaminergic pathways, possibly by regulating the release of GABA.", 
    "66": "The acute and early morning effects of midazolam 15mg and alcohol 0.5g/kg on subjective measures of CNS activity, psychomotor performance and car driving ability were investigated in eight healthy female volunteers. One hour following treatment with midazolam and midazolam + alcohol, critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT) was significantly depressed and subjects perceived themselves as feeling more sedated when compared to treatment with placebo or alcohol alone. Perceived ease of getting to sleep (GTS) was also improved by midazolam and the midazolam + alcohol combination. Stimulus processing time was significantly increased at one hour after treatment by midazolam taken in conjunction with alcohol, thus resulting in an overall increase in total reaction time. On the morning following administration, both \"on the road\" assessments of car driving ability and laboratory tests of psychomotor performance were unaffected by any of the treatment conditions. Midazolam 15mg was found to be an effective sleep inducer with no evidence of residual or \"hangover\" effects, although the drug's hypnotic activity may be augmented by social doses of alcohol.", 
    "67": "The anticonvulsive effect of midazolam was studied in rats and mice brains. Microiontophoretically applied midazolam (0.2M, pH 3.5) potentiated the GABA effect at the single neurone level, and inhibited neuronal firing in the rat cuneate neurones. Midazolam administered intraperitoneally (15 mg/kg) increased the primary afferent depolarization for at least two hours. Three mg/kg of midazolam slightly increased the glutamate decarboxylase activities in the mice cerebrum and the increase was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The authors reported a case of clinical application of midazolam: a status epilepticus was successfully treated with it, while intravenous diazepam of 30 mg failed to control the status.", 
    "68": "This study was carried out to compare the efficacy of chlormethiazole and chlordiazepoxide in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome in 40 patients. Repeated biochemical, clinical, and psychophysiological measurements were obtained in a randomized, double-blind design in which one group of patients received chlormethiazole and a second group received chlordiazepoxide over a period of 7 days. Analysis indicated both drugs to be of equivalent potency and were equally well tolerated by patients. The more severe aspects of withdrawal were brought under control within the first 4 days of treatment. However, even at 7 days, there still persisted some symptoms attributable to the withdrawal from alcohol.", 
    "69": "The plasmatic levels of free, sulfoconjugated and total dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG), the main deaminated metabolite of noradrenaline, have been measured in thirty DSM3 major depressive inpatients and in thirty healthy controls matched for sex and age. DOPEG levels have been measured by a radioenzymatic assay. Almost fifty per cent of depressed inpatients were D.S.T. non suppressors, thirteen patients were unipolar and thirteen bipolar. Plasmatic DOPEG levels were significantly lower in depressed patients as compared to healthy controls despite a wide interindividual range of DOPEG values. However, the ratio of free over conjugated DOPEG was not statistically different in the two groups. DOPEG levels were slightly higher in the female population of healthy volunteers but not in the depressed patients. In the healthy volunteers, but not in depressed patients, there was a trend for free DOPEG to increase and for conjugated DOPEG to decrease with age. There was no statistical correlation between the DOPEG levels and Hamilton Depression Scores. Also plasmatic DOPEG values were not different in uni or bipolar patients and in DST suppressor or DST non suppressor inpatients. The significance of the decrease of plasmatic DOPEG levels in depressed patients is discussed: this diminution may reflect a deficiency in noradrenaline metabolism in CNS or else may be attributed to other factors e.g. alteration in circadian rhythms, differences in motor activity, in level of anxiety, in sleep and feeding behaviors; cotreatment with benzodiazepine and opiate compounds; monoamine oxidase activity.", 
    "70": "In order to evaluate the criteria for discontinuing neonatal anticonvulsant treatment, 55 newborns with seizures have been studied. Clinical and EEG serial examinations were performed: soon after the first seizure, throughout the hospital course, and during the follow-up every 3 months until a year, and every 6 months later on. Anticonvulsant treatment with phenobarbital was discontinued (at 4 days-19 months; mean 104 days) on the basis of the following variables: type and number of seizures, time taken for their control, type and persistence of EEG abnormalities, initial neurological features, and seizure etiology. At the follow-up (12 months-8 years; mean 36 months) only 4 children had relapsed, 3 of them with a single short seizure without EEG abnormalities. The results obtained by means of the correlation between the length of anticonvulsant treatment and the clinical and EEG variables provide evidence of the value of the criteria employed. Of these, the duration of persistence of EEG abnormalities was the most important for planning the maintenance of anticonvulsant treatment and its discontinuation."
