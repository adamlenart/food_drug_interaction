    "1": "Using population-based linked administrative databases, we examined longitudinal trends in age-standardized rates of sedative use among different age groups of community-dwelling adults (age \u2265 18 yr), from 2004 to 2013. For each calendar year, we classified adults as nonusers, short-term users, or long-term users of sedatives based on their patterns of sedative dispensation. For calendar year 2013, we applied cross-sectional analysis and estimated logistic regression models to identify health and socioeconomic risk factors associated with long-term sedative use.", 
    "2": "More than half (53.4%) of long-term users of sedatives in British Columbia are between ages 18 and 64 years (young and middle-aged adults). From 2004 to 2013, long-term sedative use remained stable among adults more than 65 years of age (older adults) and increased slightly among young and middle-aged adults. Although the use of benzodiazepines decreased during the study period, the trend was offset by equal or greater increases in long-term use of z-drugs. Being an older adult, sick, poor and single were associated with increased odds of long-term sedative use.", 
    "3": "Despite efforts to stem such patterns of medication use, long-term use of sedatives increased in British Columbia between 2004 and 2013. This increase was driven largely by increased use among middle-aged adults. Future deprescribing efforts that target adults of all ages may help curb this trend.", 
    "4": "A novel microextraction technique based on ultrasound-assisted low-density solvent dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (UA-LDS-DLLME) had been applied for the determination of 4 designer benzodiazepines (phenazepam, diclazepam, flubromazepam and etizolam) in urine samples by gas chromatography- triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QQQ-MS). Ethyl acetate (168\u03bcL) was added into the urine samples after adjusting pH to 11.3. The samples were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5.5min to form a cloudy suspension. After centrifugation at 10000rpm for 3min, the supernatant extractant was withdrawn and injected into the GC-QQQ-MS for analysis. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency have been investigated and optimized by means of single factor experiment and response surface methodology (Box-Behnken design). Under the optimum extraction conditions, a recovery of 73.8-85.5% were obtained for all analytes. The analytical method was linear for all analytes in the range from 0.003 to 10\u03bcg/mL with the correlation coefficient ranging from 0.9978 to 0.9990. The LODs were estimated to be 1-3ng/mL. The accuracy (expressed as mean relative error MRE) was within \u00b15.8% and the precision (expressed as relative standard error RSD) was less than 5.9%. UA-LDS-DLLME technique has the advantages of shorter extraction time and is suitable for simultaneous pretreatment of samples in batches. The combination of UA-LDS-DLLME with GC-QQQ-MS offers an alternative analytical approach for the sensitive detection of these designer benzodiazepines in urine matrix for clinical and medico-legal purposes.",

Here, we demonstrate that the cell-surface protein CD276/B7-H3 is broadly overexpressed by multiple tumor types on both cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating blood vessels, making it a potentially ideal dual-compartment therapeutic target. In preclinical studies CD276 ADCs armed with a conventional MMAE warhead destroyed CD276-positive cancer cells, but were ineffective against tumor vasculature. In contrast, pyrrolobenzodiazepine-conjugated CD276 ADCs killed both cancer cells and tumor vasculature, eradicating large established tumors and metastases, and improving long-term overall survival. CD276-targeted dual-compartment ablation could aid in the development of highly selective broad-acting anti-cancer therapies.",

    "12": "NMS and MC are life-threatening, neuropsychiatric syndromes, associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. NMS is diagnosed when there is a recent history of treatment with an antipsychotic (AP) medication, while MC is diagnosed when the symptoms resemble NMS but without a history of exposure to an AP agent. Some authorities believe that apart from the history of exposure to an AP medication, the two conditions are identical. The symptoms of NMS/MC include severe agitation, behavior disregulation, motor and speech changes, self-injury and aggression, autonomic instability, and a range of psychiatric symptoms (affective, anxiety, or psychotic symptoms). Patients may be misdiagnosed with another disorder leading to extensive tests and a delay in treatment.

BEO can affect synaptic transmission, modulate electroencephalographic activity and it showed neuroprotective and analgesic properties. The phytocomplex, along with other essential oils, is also widely used in aromatherapy to minimize symptoms of stress-induced anxiety and mild mood disorders. However, only limited preclinical evidences are actually available. This study examined the anxiolytic/sedative-like effects of BEO using an open field task (OFT), an elevated plus-maze task (EPM), and a forced swimming task (FST) in rats. This study further compared behavioural effects of BEO to those of the benzodiazepine diazepam. Analysis of data suggests that BEO induces anxiolytic-like/relaxant effects in animal behavioural tasks not superimposable to those of the DZP. The present observations provide further insight to the pharmacological profile of BEO and support its rational use in aromatherapy.", 
    "16": "In many societies, the majority of adults regularly consume alcohol. However, only a small proportion develops alcohol addiction. Individuals at risk often show a high sensation-seeking/low-anxiety behavioural phenotype. Here we asked which role EF hand domain containing 2 (EFhd2; Swiprosin-1) plays in the control of alcohol addiction-associated behaviours. EFhd2 knockout (KO) mice drink more alcohol than controls and spontaneously escalate their consumption. This coincided with a sensation-seeking and low-anxiety phenotype. A reversal of the behavioural phenotype with \u03b2-carboline, an anxiogenic inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist, normalized alcohol preference in EFhd2 KO mice, demonstrating an EFhd2-driven relationship between personality traits and alcohol preference. These findings were confirmed in a human sample where we observed a positive association of the EFhd2 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs112146896 with lifetime drinking and a negative association with anxiety in healthy adolescents. The lack of EFhd2 reduced extracellular dopamine levels in the brain, but enhanced responses to alcohol. In confirmation, gene expression analysis revealed reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression and the regulation of genes involved in cortex development, Eomes and Pax6, in EFhd2 KO cortices. These findings were corroborated in Xenopus tadpoles by EFhd2 knockdown. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mice showed that a lack of EFhd2 reduces cortical volume in adults. Moreover, human MRI confirmed the negative association between lifetime alcohol drinking and superior frontal gyrus volume. We propose that EFhd2 is a conserved resilience factor against alcohol consumption and its escalation, working through Pax6/Eomes. Reduced EFhd2 function induces high-risk personality traits of sensation-seeking/low anxiety associated with enhanced alcohol consumption, which may be related to cortex function.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 11 April 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.63.",

Two of these 9 cases did not provide enough information to make a diagnosis of catatonia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5). The Liverpool Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Causality Scale was modified to assess ADRs secondary to drug withdrawal. From the 7 published cases which met DSM-5 catatonia criteria, using the modified scale, we established that 3 were definitive and 4 were probable cases of catatonia secondary to clozapine withdrawal. A new definitive case is described with three catatonic episodes which (1) occurred after sudden discontinuation of clozapine in the context of decades of follow-up, (2) had \u22653 of 12 DSM-5 catatonic symptoms and serum creatinine kinase elevation, and (3) required medical hospitalization and intravenous fluids. Clozapine may be a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist; sudden clozapine withdrawal may explain a sudden decrease in GABA activity that may contribute to the development of catatonic symptoms in vulnerable patients. Based on the limited information from these cases, the pharmacological treatment for catatonia secondary to sudden clozapine withdrawal can include benzodiazepines and/or restarting clozapine.",

    "26": "Methylene blue (MB) is commonly used in diagnostic procedures and is also used to treat various medical conditions. Neurological effects of MB have been reported in clinical observations and experimental studies. Thus the modulation of GABAA receptor function by MB was investigated. Whole-cell GABA-activated currents were recorded from HEK293\u00a0cells expressing various GABAA receptor subunit configurations. MB inhibition of GABA currents was apparent at 3\u00a0\u03bcM, and it had an IC50 of 31\u00a0\u03bcM in human \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 receptors. The MB action was rapid and reversible. MB inhibition was not mediated via the picrotoxin site, as a mutation (T6'F of the \u03b22 subunit) known to confer resistance to picrotoxin had no effect on MB-induced inhibition. Blockade of GABAA receptors by MB was demonstrated across a range of receptors expressing varying subunits, including those expressed at extrasynaptic sites. The sensitivity of \u03b11\u03b22 receptors to MB was similar to that observed in \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 receptors, indicating that MB's action via the benzodiazepine or Zn(2+) site is unlikely. MB-induced inhibition of GABA response was competitive with respect to GABA. Furthermore, mutation of \u03b11 F64 to A and \u03b22 Y205 to F in the extracellular N-terminus, both residues which are known to comprise GABA binding pocket, remarkably diminished MB inhibition of GABA currents. These data suggest that MB inhibits GABAA receptor function by direct or allosteric interaction with the GABA binding site. Finally, in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, MB inhibited GABA-activated currents as well as GABAergic IPSCs. We demonstrate that MB directly inhibits GABAA receptor function, which may underlie some of the effects of MB on the CNS.", 
    "27": "Behavioural changes associated with idiopathic epilepsy (IE) have been identified in dogs, with fear and anxiety-related problems seen in both drug-na\u00efve dogs and dogs treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Treating anxiety-related behaviour in dogs with IE may be challenging, as seizures are a contraindication for many conventional anxiolytic drugs. In addition, many dogs with IE are already treated with AEDs to reduce their seizure frequency, which may have negative effects if used in polytherapy. Imepitoin is low-affinity partial agonist at the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site of the GABAA receptor, and has been demonstrated to have both anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects in laboratory rodents. Imepitoin has been developed for the treatment of IE in dogs, with demonstrated anticonvulsant effects and high tolerability and safety. To date, imepitoin's potential to reduce anxiety in dogs with IE has not been investigated. An online survey was conducted to investigate the effect of imepitoin on fear and anxiety-related behaviours in dogs with IE. Eighty-five valid responses were received from owners of dogs with IE currently treated with imepitoin. Anxiety-related behaviour was quantified before and during imepitoin treatment using a validated questionnaire tool (C-BARQ).",

The aim of this work was to develop and validate a rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric method for the analysis of three common sedative and analgesic agents: morphine, clonidine and midazolam, and their metabolites (morphine-3-glucuronide, morphine-6-glucuronide and 1'-hydroxymidazolam) in blood plasma at trace level concentrations. Low concentrations and low sampling volumes may be expected in pediatric patients; we report the lowest limit of quantification for all analytes as 0.05ng/mL using only 100\u03bcL of blood plasma. The analytes were separated chromatographically using the C18 column with the weak ion-pairing additive 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol and methanol. The method was fully validated and a matrix matched calibration range of 0.05-250ng/mL was attained for all analytes In addition, between-day accuracy for all analytes remained within 93-108%, and precision remained within 1.5-9.6% for all analytes at all concentration levels over the calibration range.",

Saturation binding studies at the M2R, using the orthosteric antagonist atropine to determine unspecific binding, proved that the monomeric and the dimeric compound bind to the orthosteric binding site (apparent Kd: 0.87 and 0.31 nM, respectively). Various binding studies with [(3)H]19 and [(3)H]33 at the M2R, for instance, saturation binding experiments in the presence of the allosteric MR modulators W84 (8) or LY2119620 (9) (Schild-like analysis) suggested a competitive mechanism between the allosteric modulator and the dibenzodiazepinone derivatives, and thus a dualsteric binding mode of both 19 and 33.

To investigate these, one of the authors ingested a capsule containing 0.5\u00a0mg of the drug. Metabolism studies and suitability tests for the detection with immunochemical assays were performed with the samples obtained from the self-experiment and five authentic case samples. Flubromazolam and its mono-hydroxylated metabolite were detectable by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in urine for up to 6.5 and 8\u00a0days, respectively (lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) flubromazolam: 0.1\u00a0ng/mL). Peak serum concentrations were as low as 8\u00a0ng/mL (8\u00a0h post ingestion). Glucuronides were also detected. The terminal elimination half-life could be estimated in the range of 10-20\u00a0h. Immunochemical assays yielded negative results for serum samples and positive results for urine samples for up to five days post ingestion.

Bronchoscopic examination is generally recommended prior to performing tracheostomy in patients suspected to have post-intubation tracheal obstruction. Based on our findings, we suggest that these examinations should also be performed in patients with conditions associated with chronic irritation of the respiratory tract, including those with a prolonged history of self-induced vomiting.", 
    "54": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurological emergency that results from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or the initiation of mechanisms that lead to abnormally prolonged seizures. Although the failure of inhibitory mechanisms during SE is well understood, the seizure-initiating mechanisms are poorly understood. We tested whether hippocampal \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated transmission was enhanced during SE and assessed the underlying molecular mechanism. In animals in self-sustaining limbic SE the amplitudes of the miniature, spontaneous, and AMPA-evoked excitatory currents recorded from the CA1 pyramidal neurons were larger than those recorded in the controls. The evoked EPSCs rectified inwardly. In these animals, the surface expression of GluA1 subunit-containing AMPARs was increased in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. The phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on S831 and S845 residues was reduced in animals in SE. In contrast, the GluA1 subunit surface expression and AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission of dentate granule cells (DGCs) was not altered. Treating animals in SE with the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 or with diazaepam blocked the increased surface expression of the GluA1 subunits. NMDAR blockade also prevented the dephosphorylation of the S845 residue but not that of S831. Targeting NMDARs and AMPARs may provide novel strategies to treat benzodiazepine-refractory SE.",

Data on all nurses enrolled in the study were derived from the reimbursement claim records in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database for the period 2004-2008. The case group comprised 33\u00a0588 nurses with BZD use, and the control group was exactly matched to each case according to age and sex. The patterns of occasional, frequent, and daily BZD use demonstrated an increasing trend from 2004 to 2008. This trend was observed for most of the BZD with a short or intermediate half-life. Older nurses (>45\u00a0years) and those with greater experience (\u22655\u00a0years) were more likely to use BZD frequently. Moreover, the risk of frequent BZD use increased significantly when nurses exhibited comorbid depression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.58), anxiety (aOR: 1.78), or sleep disorders (aOR: 2.29) compared with infrequent BZD use. The results indicated that nurses with BZD use had comorbidities of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. The increasing trend of patterns of BZD use and its association with sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety can be used as references for stress and sleep management in nurses.",

This study explores effectiveness of clomethiazole versus oxazepam in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome within an observational, stratified, non-inferiority study in routine care. Main outcome criterion was severity of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome (Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome [AWS]) Scale in the first five days. Additionally, the association between the detoxification protocol (five vs. ten days) and AWS-Score was examined. 453 patients (74.2\u200a% male, average age 47.1 years [\u00b1\u200a9.2]) took part; 249 received oxazepam (55.0\u200a%) and 204 clomethiazole (45.0\u200a%).

The objective of this study is to review the current evidence for pharmacologic treatment of CHS. Medline, PsycINFO, DARE, OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2017. Articles were selected and reviewed independently. Evidence was graded using Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. The search resulted in 1262 articles with 63 of them eligible for inclusion (205 human subjects). There were 4 prospective level-2, 3 retrospective level-3 studies, 12 level-4 case series, and 44 level-5 case reports. Among level-2 studies (64 subjects), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and lorazepam were discussed as effective long- and short-term treatments, respectively, in two studies. Ondansetron, promethazine, diphenhydramine, and opioids were also mentioned, but the authors did not comment on their efficacy. Among level-3 studies (43 subjects), one reported effective treatment with antiepileptics zonisamide and levetiracetam, but not TCAs. Another reported favorable response to morphine, ondansetron, and lorazepam but did not specify the actual number of patients receiving specific treatment. Among the level-4 case series (54 subjects), benzodiazepines, haloperidol, and capsaicin were reported as helpful. For level-5 case reports (44 subjects), benzodiazepines, metoclopramide, haloperidol, ondansetron, morphine, and capsaicin were reported as effective. Effective treatments mentioned only once included fentanyl, diazepam, promethazine, methadone, nabilone, levomepromazine, piritramide, and pantoprazole. Hot showers and baths were cited in all level-4 and -5 articles as universally effective. High-quality evidence for pharmacologic treatment of CHS is limited. Benzodiazepines, followed by haloperidol and capsaicin, were most frequently reported as effective for acute treatment, and TCAs for long-term treatment. As the prevalence of CHS increases, future prospective trials are greatly needed to evaluate and further define optimal pharmacologic treatment of patients with CHS.",

We examine the experiences of persons who report a nonfatal drug overdose. Fifty people who inject drugs (PWID) and who had accidently overdosed in the past 12 months were recruited and interviewed at 1 of 4 Needle and Syringe Program sites during September and October 2013.Participants were typically male, middle-aged, with long injecting histories. Half of the participants reported mainly injecting pharmaceutical opioids. Most overdoses occurred at home with others present. An ambulance was called for only 38% of cases and 26% were admitted to a hospital emergency department. Police were seldom involved, and there were no complaints about the involvement of police at the time of the overdose.Participants commonly had a history of overdosing, and most were on prescription medications for physical and/or mental health problems. Poly drug use was common for those reporting an accidental overdose. Benzodiazepines (eg, Xanax or Valium) were implicated in just over half of the overdoses.Most of those reporting a recent overdose also report a past history of previous overdoses. Most of those reporting a previous overdose continue to use substances in ways they are aware contribute to the risk of an overdose.",

BRDs are protein interaction modules that recognizing \u03b5-N-acetyl-lysine (\u03b5Ac-Lys) motifs found in histone tails and are promising protein-protein interaction (PPI) targets. First, we analyzed a peptide ligand containing \u03b5Ac-Lys to evaluate native PPIs. We then analyzed tetrahydroquinazoline-6-yl-benzensulfonamide derivatives found by fragment-based drug design (FBDD) and examined their interactions with the protein compared with the peptide ligand in terms of the inter-fragment interaction energy. In addition, we analyzed benzodiazepine derivatives that are high-affinity ligands for BRDs and examined differences in the CH/\u03c0 interactions of the amino acid residues. We further surveyed changes in the charges of the amino acid residues among individual ligands, performed pair interaction energy decomposition analysis and estimated the water profile within the ligand binding site. Thus, useful insights for drug design were provided. Through these analyses and considerations, we show that the FMO method is a useful drug design tool to evaluate the process of FBDD and to explore PPI inhibitors.",

    "82": "Cocaine, a powerful vasoconstrictor, induces immune responses including cytokine elevations. Chronic cocaine use is associated with functional brain impairments potentially mediated by vascular pathology. Although the Crack-Cocaine epidemic has declined, its vascular consequences are increasingly becoming evident among individuals with cocaine use disorder of that period, now aging. Paradoxically, during the period when prevention efforts could make a difference, this population receives psychosocial treatment at best. We review major postmortem and in vitro studies documenting cocaine-induced vascular toxicity. PubMed and Academic Search Complete were used with relevant terms. Findings consist of the major mechanisms of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis, emphasizing acute, chronic, and secondary effects of cocaine. The etiology underlying cocaine's acute and chronic vascular effects is multifactorial, spanning hypertension, impaired homeostasis and platelet function, thrombosis, thromboembolism, and alterations in blood flow. Early detection of vascular disease in cocaine addiction by multimodality imaging is discussed. Treatment may be similar to indications in patients with traditional risk-factors, with few exceptions such as enhanced supportive care and use of benzodiazepines and phentolamine for sedation, and avoiding \u03b2-blockers. Given the vascular toxicity cocaine induces, further compounded by smoking and alcohol comorbidity, and interacting with aging of the crack generation, there is a public health imperative to identify pre-symptomatic markers of vascular impairments in cocaine addiction and employ preventive treatment to reduce silent disease progression.", 
    "83": "Medications that trigger sleepwalking may inadvertently put the patient at risk of injury to themselves and/or others, and contribute to poor treatment adherence. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify drugs that may increase the risk of sleepwalking. A search of CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and ScienceDirect was conducted with the keywords 'sleepwalking' OR 'somnambulism'. Of the original 83 sourced papers, 62 met the inclusion criteria and were subsequently included for review. Twenty-nine drugs, primarily in four classes-benzodiazepine receptor agonists and other gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators, antidepressants and other serotonergic agents, antipsychotics, and \u03b2-blockers-were identified as possible triggers for sleepwalking. The strongest evidence for medication-induced sleepwalking was for zolpidem and sodium oxybate. All other associations were based on case reports. This research highlights the importance of considering sleepwalking in risk profiles in clinical trials, particularly for drugs that enhance GABA activity at the GABAA receptor, enhance serotonergic activity, or block the activity of noradrenaline at \u03b2 receptors. The results also have implications for prescribers to consider sleepwalking as a potential adverse effect and ensure that: 1) the patient is educated about a safe sleep environment; 2) they are encouraged to report the onset or exacerbation of sleepwalking, and 3) alternative treatments are considered if sleepwalking occurs.",

Ten adult female impala were induced with two induction protocols: one consisted of 0.2 mg/kg medetomidine, 4 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.15 mg/kg butorphanol (MKB) and one consisted of 0.375 mg/kg etorphine, 0.2 mg/kg medetomidine, and 0.2 mg/kg midazolam (EMM). In both treatments, anesthesia was maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion (CII) at an initial dose rate of 1.2 \u03bcg/kg per hr medetomidine, 2.4 mg/kg per hr ketaminen and 36 \u03bcg/kg per hr midazolam. Partial reversal was achieved with naltrexone (2\u2009:\u20091 mg butorphanol; 20\u2009:\u20091 mg etorphine) and atipamezole (5\u2009:\u20091 mg medetomidine). Evaluation of anesthesia included respiratory rate, heart rate, rectal temperature, arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, end tidal carbon dioxide tension, and tidal volume at 5-min intervals, palpebral reflex and response to painful stimuli at 15-min intervals, and arterial blood gases at 30-min intervals. Plasma cortisol concentration was determined after induction and before reversal. Duration and quality of induction and recovery were evaluated. EMM caused a faster induction of 9.5 \u00b1 2.9 min compared to 11.0 \u00b1 6.4 min in MKB. Recovery was also quicker in EMM (EMM: 6.3 \u00b1 5.4 min; MKB: 9.8 \u00b1 6.0 min). However, EMM also produced more cardiopulmonary side effects, including hypoxemia and hypercapnia, and calculated oxygenation indices (PaCO2-PETCO2) were worse than in MKB. One animal died after induction with EMM. The CII provided surgical anesthesia in 7 of 10 animals in MKB and in 9 of 9 animals in EMM for 120 min. In conclusion, the MKB induction protocol had advantages for prolonged anesthesia in impala with significantly less cardiopulmonary depression compared to EMM. The comparably decreased anesthetic depth could easily be adjusted by an increase of the CII.",

The animal was otherwise in good physical condition at each anesthetic procedure. Following premedication with intramuscular midazolam and butorphanol, anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with sevoflurane by intubation. During surgery ventilation was controlled. Blood pressure was indirectly estimated using either oscillometric or pulse oximetry. Presumed hypotension was managed by adjusting the sevoflurane concentration and infusion of dopamine. During recovery, the dolphin regained adequate spontaneous respiration following intravenous administration of flumazenil and doxapram. The dolphin was extubated at 85 min and 53 min after the first and second surgeries, respectively. Successful weaning from the ventilator and initiation of spontaneous respiration was the most important complication encountered. Establishment of a reliable blood pressure measurement technique is critical to success for anesthesia in this species.",

    "99": "A 61-year-old woman with an unknown psychiatric history presented with mutism, stupor, negativism, and withdrawn behavior. She was admitted to the psychiatric unit for what appeared to be catatonia. Medical records were not readily available. A comprehensive evaluation did not uncover any medical etiology. Lorazepam was ineffective at consistently reversing her catatonic symptoms. During week three of hospitalization, she was given olanzapine with subsequent improvement in her negativism. Several physicians believed her catatonic symptoms were feigned given multiple episodes of spontaneous purposeful movement when she was not under the direct supervision of staff. There is minimal literature on distinguishing catatonia and factitious disorder. This distinction is crucial because these diagnoses require very different treatments, and the iatrogenic complications related to the treatment of catatonia with high-dose benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy are significant. Rapid access to electronic health records can facilitate treatment for patients who cannot provide a medical history, especially when factitious disorder is included in the differential diagnosis.",

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) deficits were proposed to be implicated in development of PTSD, but the alterations of GABA receptor A (GABAAR) subunits induced by early traumatic stress have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, previous studies suggested that exercise could be more effective than medications in reducing severity of anxiety and depression but the mechanism is unclear. This study used inescapable foot-shock to induce PTSD in juvenile rats and examined their emotional changes using open-field test and elevated plus maze, memory changes using Morris water maze, and the expression of GABAAR subunits (\u03b32, \u03b12, and \u03b15) in subregions of the brain in the adulthood using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We aimed to observe the role of GABAAR subunits changes induced by juvenile trauma in the pathogenesis of subsequent PTSD in adulthood. In addition, we investigated the protective effects of exercise for 6 weeks and benzodiazepine (clonazepam) for 2 weeks. This study found that juvenile traumatic stress induced chronic anxiety and spatial memory loss and reduced expression of GABAAR subunits in the adult rat brains. Furthermore, exercise led to significant improvement as compared to short-term BZ treatment.",

During this process of labilization/restabilization memory traces can be either impaired, strengthened or updated in content. Here, we study if a consolidated memory can be updated by linking one original cue to two different outcomes and whether this process was modulated by the GABAergic system. To aim that, we designed two experiments carried out in three consecutive days. All participants learned a list of non-sense syllable pairs on day 1. On day 2 the new information was introduced after the reminder or no-reminder presentation. Participants were tested on day 3 for the updated or original list (Exp. 1). In Exp. 2 we tested whether this new information was incorporated by an inhibitory process mediated by the GABAergic system. For that, participants retrieved the original information before being taken Clonazepam 0.25mg (GABAA agonist) or Placebo pill. We found that the groups that received the reminder correctly recalled the old and new information. However, the no reminder groups only correctly recalled the original information. Furthermore, when testing occurred in the presence of Clonazepam, the group that received the reminder plus the new information showed an impaired original memory performance compared to the group that received only Clonazepam (without reminder) or the reminder plus Placebo pill. These results show that new information can be added to a reactivated declarative memory in humans by linking one cue to two different outcomes. Furthermore, we shed light on the mechanisms of memory updating being the GABAergic system involved in the modulation of the old and new information expression.",

In the present study, the inhibitory action of GC and GG on CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were investigated. The results demonstrated that both GC and GG strongly inhibited CYP3A-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, nifedipine oxidation and testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation. Notably, the inhibitory intensity of GC towards CYP3A4 was stronger than CYP3A5 when using midazolam and nifedipine as substrates. While inhibition of GC towards CYP3A5 was weaker than CYP3A4 when using testosterone as substrate. In contrast, GG showed a stronger inhibitory activity on CYP3A5 than CYP3A4 without substrate-dependent behavior. In addition, docking simulations indicated that the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between CYP3A4 and GC, and hydrogen-bond interaction between CYP3A5 and GG might result in their different inhibitory actions. Furthermore, the AUC of drugs metabolized by CYP3A was estimated to increase by 8%-321% and 2%-3190% in the presence of GC and GG, respectively. These findings strongly suggested that GC and GG showed high HDI potentials, and the position of methylenedioxy group determined their different inhibitory effect towards CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which are of significance for the application of Schisandra chinensis-containing herbs.",

Hydrolysis reactions greatly improved the sensitivity of benzodiazepines by liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. The large variation in resorufin (IHI) area counts amongst patient samples indicates possible variability in enzymatic hydrolysis activity. The enzymatic hydrolysis step is a part of the extraction procedure and should be controlled for in each patient sample.",

Age and gender of the deceased, the manner of death (accident, suicide or undetermined) and types of co-ingested drugs were evaluated in relation to the concentrations of caffeine in blood (N = 51). The mean age (\u00b1SD) of the victims was 39 \u00b1 17.8 years (range 18-84 years) and most were female (N = 31 or 61%). The difference in mean age of males (42 \u00b1 17.2 years) and females (37 \u00b1 18.3 years) was not statistically significant (t = 0.811, P = 0.421). The mean (\u00b1SD), median and range of caffeine concentrations in postmortem blood were 187 \u00b1 96 mg/L (180 mg/L) and 33-567 mg/L, respectively. The median concentration of caffeine in males (161 mg/L) was not significantly different from that of females (182 mg/L), z = 1.18, P = 0.235. There was no correlation between the age of the deceased and the concentration of caffeine in postmortem blood (R2 = 0.026, P > 0.05). Manner of death was classified as suicide in 51% of cases (median blood-caffeine 185 mg/L), accidental in 16% (median 183 mg/L) or undetermined in 33% (median 113 mg/L). The median concentration of caffeine in blood was lower when manner of death was undetermined compared with suicide or accidental (P = 0.023). Although other drugs, including ethanol, antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and/or ephedrine, were often identified in postmortem blood, the predominant psychoactive substance was caffeine. The deceased had ingested caffeine in tablet or powder form and it does not seem likely that toxic concentrations of caffeine can be achieved from over-consumption of caffeinated beverages alone.",

As poor coordination of children, the procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia with spontaneous or controlled ventilation to increase children and bronchoscopists' safety and comfort. Previous studies have reported that dexmedetomidine (DEX) could be safely and effectively used for flexible bronchoscopy in both adulate and children. However, there is no trial to evaluate the dose-finding of safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine-remifentanil (DEX-RF) in children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.The objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-finding of safety and efficacy of DEX-RF in children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.One hundred thirty-five children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy with DEX-RF were divided into 3 groups: Group DR1 (n\u200a=\u200a47, DEX infusion at 0.5\u200a\u03bcg\u00b7kg for 10\u200aminutes, then adjusted to 0.5-0.7\u200a\u03bcg kg h; RF infusion at 0.5\u200a\u03bcg kg for 2\u200aminutes, then adjusted to 0.05-0.2\u200a\u03bcg kg min), Group DR2 (n\u200a=\u200a43, DEX infusion at 1\u200a\u03bcg kg for 10\u200aminutes, then adjusted to 0.5-0.7\u200a\u03bcg kg h; RF infusion at 1\u200a\u03bcg kg for 2\u200aminutes, then adjusted to 0.05-0.2\u200a\u03bcg kg min), Group DR3 (n\u200a=\u200a45, DEX infusion at 1.5\u200a\u03bcg kg for 10\u200aminutes, then adjusted to 0.5-0.7\u200a\u03bcg kg h; RF infusion at 1\u200a\u03bcg kg for 2\u200aminutes, then adjusted to 0.05-0.2\u200a\u03bcg kg min).

Additionally, the perioperative hemodynamic profile was more stable in group DR3 than that in the other 2 groups. Total number of children movements during flexible bronchoscopy was higher in DR1 group than the other 2 groups (46.81% 22/47 vs 34.88% 15/43 vs 17.78% 8/45, respectively, of DR1, DR2, DR3, P\u200a=\u200a0.012). Total doses of rescue midazolam and lidocaine were significantly higher in DR1 and DR2 groups than that of DR3 group (P\u200a=\u200a0.000). The time to first dose of rescue midazolam and lidocaine was significantly longer in DR3 group than DR1 and DR2 groups (P\u200a=\u200a0.000).

    "227": "Benzodiazepines are commonly used for the treatment of acute agitation in a psychiatric setting.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant publications. Randomized trials evaluating intramuscular (IM) midazolam or lorazepam given as monotherapy or as add-on treatment, with more than 10 patients aged 18-65 years, conducted in a psychiatric setting, and published between January 1, 1980, and February 3, 2016, were included. 16 studies from a search result of 5\u2009516 studies were included. In total, 577 patients were treated with lorazepam IM 2-4\u2009mg, and 329 patients were treated with midazolam IM 5-15\u2009mg. It is unclear whether lorazepam IM or midazolam IM is as efficacious as an antipsychotic IM. It is a bit more certain that the combination of benzodiazepines IM and a low dose antipsychotic IM is more efficacious than the benzodiazepine and the antipsychotic alone. However, there is no doubt that benzodiazepines are less likely to be associated with treatment emergent side effects, as compared to antipsychotics.", 
    "228": "Clinical studies have shown that Selank had an anxiolytic effect comparable to that of classical benzodiazepine drugs, which can enhance the inhibitory effect of GABA by allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors. These data suggest that the molecular mechanism of the effect of Selank may also be related to its ability to affect the performance of the GABAergic system. To test this hypothesis, we studied the changes in expression of 84 genes involved in the functioning of the GABAergic system and in the processes of neurotransmission in the culture of neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells using qPCR method. As test substances, in addition to Selank, we selected the major GABAA receptor ligand, GABA, the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, and combinations of these compounds (Selank and GABA; Selank and olanzapine). We found no changes in the mRNA levels of the genes studied under the effect of Selank. The combined effect of GABA and Selank led to nearly complete suppression of changes in expression of genes in which mRNA levels changed under the effect of GABA. When Selank was used in conjunction with olanzapine, the expression alterations of more genes were observed compared with olanzapine alone. The data obtained indicate that Selank has no direct effect on the mRNA levels of the GABAergic system genes in neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells. At the same time, our results partially confirm the hypothesis that the peptide may affect the interaction of GABA with GABAA receptors. Our data also suggest that Selank may enhance the effect of olanzapine on the expression of the genes studied.",

Methadone is preferred over buprenorphine-naloxone for patients at higher risk of treatment dropout, such as injection opioid users (level I evidence). Youth and pregnant women who inject opioids should also receive methadone first (level III evidence). If buprenorphine-naloxone is prescribed first, the patient should be promptly switched to methadone if withdrawal symptoms, cravings, or opioid use persist despite an optimal buprenorphine-naloxone dose (level II evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is recommended for socially stable prescription oral opioid users, particularly if their work or family commitments make it difficult for them to attend the pharmacy daily, if they have a medical or psychiatric condition requiring regular primary care (level IV evidence), or if their jobs require higher levels of cognitive functioning or psychomotor performance (level III evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is also recommended for patients at high risk of methadone toxicity, such as the elderly, those taking high doses of benzodiazepines or other sedating drugs, heavy drinkers, those with a lower level of opioid tolerance, and those at high risk of prolonged QT interval (level III evidence).",

Main outcome measures\u00a0Annual percentage of opioid users with concurrent benzodiazepine use; annual incidence of visits to emergency room and inpatient admissions for opioid overdose.Results\u00a09% of opioid users also used a benzodiazepine in 2001, increasing to 17% in 2013 (80% relative increase). This increase was driven mainly by increases among intermittent, as opposed to chronic, opioid users. Compared with opioid users who did not use benzodiazepines, concurrent use of both drugs was associated with an increased risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission for opioid overdose (adjusted odds ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 2.05 to 2.24; P<0.001) among all opioid users. The adjusted odds ratio for an emergency room visit or inpatient admission for opioid overdose was 1.42 (1.33 to 1.51; P<0.001) for intermittent opioid users and 1.81 (1.67 to 1.96; P<0.001) chronic opioid users. If this association is causal, elimination of concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use could reduce the risk of emergency room visits related to opioid use and inpatient admissions for opioid overdose by an estimated 15% (95% confidence interval 14 to 16).Conclusions\u00a0From 2001 to 2013, concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use sharply increased in a large sample of privately insured patients in the US and significantly contributed to the overall population risk of opioid overdose.",

In addition, anxiety is a common symptom of ethanol withdrawal and it strongly contributes to relapse. Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for relief of anxiety and ethanol withdrawal symptoms but considerable side effects, such sedation, tolerance and dependence, are observed during treatment. Therefore, better drugs are needed for the treatment of anxiety states. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether topiramate would reduce basal levels of anxiety and ethanol-withdrawn induced anxiety in male rats; the elevated plus maze (EPM) was used as an animal model of anxiety. In Experiment 1, topiramate (0, 10, and 40 mg/kg, i.g.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was acutely and repeatedly administered to naive rats. In Experiments 2 and 3, topiramate (0 or 40 mg/kg, i.g.) was acutely and chronically administered in early (72 hr after ethanol removal) and protracted (21 days after ethanol removal) ethanol-withdrawn rats, respectively. Acute and repeated topiramate treatment induced anxiolytic-like effects in naive rats. Early ethanol withdrawal increased anxiety, and acute topiramate administration counteracted the anxiogenic-like effects of ethanol removal. Protracted withdrawal did not produce lasting changes in anxiety but topiramate was equally effective at reducing anxiety in ethanol-withdrawn and control animals. Importantly, no signs of tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of topiramate were observed. In conclusion, these data support a role for topiramate in the treatment of basal levels of anxiety and ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record"
