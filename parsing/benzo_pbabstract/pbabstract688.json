We have observed a male predominance and the prognostic importance of age. The survival rate of over 84 per cent that we have achieved has resulted from the dedicated care of our nursing personnel and the collaboration of collegues of various specialties. Tetanus antitoxin, 10,000 units, is sufficient. Diazepam provides adequate relaxation and sedation. Gastrostomy and tracheostomy play a considerable role.", 
    "1": "The objectives of the study have been to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of PLP 100-127 (6-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl) morphanthridin) on patients with moderate to severe insomnia, to evaluate safety and tolerance of the drug and to investigate whether or not the drug may have dependence producing properties through the possible development of mental and/or physical dependence. A clinical-therapeutical long-term comparsion as a double blind cross-over investigation between PLP 100-127 and nitrazepan is presented. 30 patients at Gaustad hospital, mainly long-term patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia, were selected for the trial, which lasted for 38 weeks. There were 9 drop outs, mainly due to relapse of psychotic symptoms. PLP 100-127 seems to have a favorable effect on moderate and severe insomnia in patients suffering from severe mental diseases. It seems to be well tolerated in these groups of patients. No signs of dependence producing properties have been observed by the observation method here presented.", 
    "2": "The pharmacological profiles of a new benzodiazepine derivative, 1-(beta-methylsulfonylethyl)-5-(o-fluorophenyl)-7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (ID-622), were shown. In anti-convulsant test, ID-622 was more potent than diazepam and medazepam when tested with pentylenetetrazol or bemegride, but was less potent than diazepam tested with strychnine or MES in mice. Taming effects of ID-622 were more potent than diazepam in both electroshock- and isolation-induced fighting mice tests, but were less potent in both septal rats and O.B. rats tests. ID-622 had only a weak influence on the spontaneous locomotor activity, and did not cause the righting reflex loss. In EEG, ID-622 increased fast activity and depressed hippocampal I-waves and amygdala after-discharge in cats. Acute toxicity of ID-622 was very low.", 
    "3": "Five neuroleptics: penfluridol, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, pimozide and oxypertine, and two benzodiazepine minor tranquilizers; chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, were studied in mice and rats. When the drugs were injected i.p. in mice, all neuroleptics increased the brain homovanillic acid (HVA) concentration but two benzodiazepines did not change it. Of the drugs tested, only pimozide increased the brain level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Penfluridol accelerated the turnover rate of brain dopamine (DA), wheras haloperidol accelerated both DA and noradrenaline turnover rates. In rats, oral administration of penfluridol caused an increase in the striatal HVA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid which persisted longer than that following haloperidol. The concentration of brain 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol, however, was not affected by penfluridol even when the drug was administered at a high dose. Based on these and earlier findings, it is concluded that the effect of penfluridol on DA metabolism resembles that of typical neuroleptic compounds and penfluridol acts only on DA neurons as a long-acting DA receptor blocker.", 
    "4": "The fluorescence characteristics of 10 substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines in strong acid solution were investigated. The compounds that fluoresce in the Hammett acidity region possess, or can form by enolization, an azomethine linkage in the 1,2- or 4,5-position. All benzodiazepines that fluoresce in strong acid show increases in fluorescence intensity with corresponding blue shifts as acidity increases. Two pKa's in the Hammett acidity region were observed for both the fluorometric and absorptiometric titrations of the benzodiazepines possessing a carbonyl in the 2-position. No evidence of excited state prototropism was observed.", 
    "5": "Medazepam, a new benzodiazepine, was studied as an oral preanaesthetic medication in adult women in a dose of 10 mg, and the findings compared with those obtained with diazepam 10 mg or a dummy capsule using a double-blind technique. In the doses used medazepam produced less drowsiness than diazepam and was no more anxiolytic than the placebo.", 
    "6": "Male CF-1 mice were treated for 14 days with diets containing haloperidol, thioridazine HCl and 4'-fluoro-4[[4-(p-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxycyclohexyl]-amino]-butyrophenone HCl (U35,777A). At various times during and after neuroleptic treatment, spontaneous and d-amphetamine-stimulated motor activity were measured. Two days after cessation of treatment, the mice displayed enhanced spontaneous and d-amphetamine-stimulated motor activity. This effect was no longer apparent 9 days after neuroleptic intake was terminated. With a quantal test based on the climbing activity induced by apomorphine, it was determined that mice were also supersensitive to apomorphine at 2 days but not 9 days after withdrawal from chronic haloperidol. In an attempt to correlate this supersensitivity to a biochemical parameter related to receptor function, dopamine-stimulated adenyl cyclase activity was assayed in striatal homogenates of mice 2 days after haloperidol withdrawal. No alteration in this parameter was observed. Likewise, the ability of apomorphine to elevate striatal cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations in vivo was unaltered by withdrawal from chronic haloperidol. Chronic treatment with neuroleptics results in a brief supersensitivity to dopaminergic agents. This effect does not appear to be accompanied by increases in dopamine-stimulated adenyl cyclase activity in the corpus striatum.", 
    "7": "Procaine HCl and diphenylhydantoin (DPH) increased the duration and propagation of epileptiform afterdischarges (ADs) produced by electrical stimulation of the amygdala in rats. Procaine and DPH also increased the rate of seizure development (kindling) produced by repeated stimulation of the amygdala. Procaine and to a limited extentDPH would themselves act as convulsants in well kindled subjects. Diazepam, on the other hand, retarded or blocked amygdaloid kindling. Diazepam trigered a high frequency (20-30 c/sec) rhtthm in the amygdala, hippocampus and preoptic area. None of these drugs had any significant effect on potentials evoked in secondary limbic sites by single electrical pulses applied to the amygdala. Also, none of these drugs had any effect on recruiting or post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) in secondary sites produced by amygdala stimulation and none of the drugs had any effect on amygdaloid AD thresholds. The effects of these drugs on the responses evoked by anterior neocortex stimulation were quite different. Diazepam had no effect on any of the characteristics of the discharge or convulsion even at twice the dose levels used for the amygdala group. Procaine and DPH, however, blocked not only the eonvulsion but the AD as well. Eighty percent of the procaine- and DPH-treated rats failed to respond with neocortical AD even at current levels as high as 2000 muA. The few cortically stimulated subjects that did respond with an AD showed a subcortical rather than a neocortical seizure response. DPH had no effect on recruiting or PTP of the transcallosal response. Both procaine and DPH produced a weak but significant increase in the amplitude of the transcallosal evoked potential, while diazepam produce a weak decrement in that response.", 
    "8": "1 Twelve normal subjects were tested on a large battery of tests after a hypnotic dose of flunitrazepam(1 or 2 mg) and a placebo. Psychological tests were given 12 h after the drug and physiological tests 12, 15 and 18 h after the drug. 2 The tests included self-ratings of hypnotic effects and mood, the electroencephalogram, the auditory electroencephalographic evoked response, skin conductance, tapping, card-sorting and the symbol copying test. 3 Both doses of flunitrazepam were effective hypnotics according to the ratings, with an anxiolytic effect the following day. The EEG was significantly altered up to 18 h after the drug and the behavioural tests showed a motor impairment 12 h after drug administration. 4 Nearly all changes displayed linear dose-related trends.", 
    "9": "Female Balb/C mice aged 60 to 72 days were mated with males aged 60 to 150 days and conception was diagnosed when a vaginal plug was noted. Females were randomized into five groups, Group A animals were fed a mixture of diazepam-propylene glycol which contained 0.02 mg. of diazepam in 0.1 ml. solution per day from day 1 to 9 of the gestation. Group B animals were fed the same mixture on days 5 to 12 of the gestation. Groups C and D animals were fed 0.1 ml. of propylene glycol on gestational days 1 to 9 and 5 to 12, respectively. Group E animals served as pure controls and were fed no drug or vehicle. All animals were killed on pregnancy day 15; All pups were counted, weighed, and studied grossly for anomalies. All uteri were scored for absorption sites. Nonpregnant uteri were studied histologically and scored for day of estrogen cycle. Animals fed diazepam on days 5 to 12 of gestation (Group B) had a significantly fewer number of pregnancies than did the other groups (p smaller than 0.001). In addition, pups delivered of diazepam-fed mice were heavier than control animals. No significant differences were noted, however, with respect to litter size, number of resorption sites, or presence of gross anomalies. In view of these data it would seem prudent to continue to avoid the use of diazepam during pregnancy.", 
    "10": "A double-blind cross-over trial was conducted using flurazepam and nitrazepam as sedatives in a group of a dozen psychiatric in-patients. The results show highly significant differences between placebo effects and the active drugs. The differences between the two drugs were not significant apart from the subjective estimate of time slept in which flurazepam was superior. As other studies have confirmed also their safety, relative lack of side effects and very low addictive potential it seems there is little to choose between them, except for the possibility that flurazepam may be preferred subjectively.", 
    "11": "Cyclisation rates of some S-alpha-amino acid derivatives (I--VII) into chiral 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones were determined under physiological-like conditions (pH, temperature) and plotted against pKa values of the corresponding alpha-amino acids. No correlation between k, i.e. t1/2 values, of the acidic precursors, and pharmacodynamic activity, as determined by some standard tests, were observed, however. Unambiguity of cyclisation, and its t1/2 values reveal benefit for physico-chemical properties of the investigated acyclic precursors as transport-forms of the chiral 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones with prolonged pharmacological activity.", 
    "12": "We reported previously that by altering the rhythm of environmental temperature (ART) the physiological mechanism was changed to an abnormal state which we termed specific ART-stress (SART-stress). In the present report, the effects of neurotropin and other tranquilizers on this SART-stress state were investigated. Neurotropin is an extract containing many conjugated polysaccarides isolated from the skin or tissues of rabbits which had been inoculated with the living cowpox virus. Neurotropin prevented the decrease in body weight of both mice and rats caused by the SART-stress. However, there was no such prevention when an extract isolated from vaccinia virus-uninjured, healthy rabbit skin was given. Chlorpromazine (Cp), reserpine (Rp), diazepam (DZ), imipramine or diphenhydramine gave no protection against the decrease in body weight. Slight increase in number and variation of respirations in SART-stress animals was to some extent prevented by neurotropin. Prolongation of the QRS interval was restored to control with the administration of the above mentioned drugs. Decrease in ACh sensitivity of the isolated duodenum tested by the Magnus-method was prevented by neurotropin. In the galvanic skin response test in rats, decrease in electric resistance on the skin, increase in reactivity and shortening of reaction time caused by SART-stress was prevented to the greatest extent by neurotropin and also to a considerable degree by parenteral administration of DZ or beta-hydroxy gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABOB), the effective results of the drugs being: Neurotropin, DZ, GABOB in that order. Cp and Rp, major tranquilizers were found to be the least effective.", 
    "13": "Phenobarbital, chordiazepoxide, diazepam and/or morphine were repeatedly administered to both male and female rats (N equals 10) for 4 similar to 6 weeks. The drug dose was gradully increased from 5 to 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg once daily (p.o) at seven day intervals. In the case of morphine, the last dose was 40 mg/kg. The drugs were constantly withdrawn for 24 hr at 8 day intervvals. None of the rats were given drugs for 16 days after administration of the last scheduled dose in order to recover their initial weight (Exp. I). Onset of dependence formation, decrease in body weight and food intake, days required to reach the maximum decrease in body weight and duration of withdrawal signs were observed throughout this experiment. The rats (drug dependence-experimented rats) who survived the first stage of this experiment were continuously subjected to re-administration by the same dosage schedule as in Exp. I (seven days of drug administration, 48hr of withdrawal). The re-administered rats showed a more rapid onset of dependence formation and a longer duration of decreas in boy weight during 16 days withdrawal than did the naive rats. It is concluded, that in addition to the decrease in body weight by withdrawal plus duration of the withdrawal signs, the onset of drug dependence formation is also a specific factor.", 
    "14": "Effects of various psychotropic drugs on tegmental and hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior in rats with chronically implanted electrodes in the brain were studied. Effects of elecrtical stimulation in several brain structures on self-stimulation behavior and influences of drugs on the stimulation effect were also investigated. The hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior was more markedly inhibited by chlorpromazine than the tegmental self-stimulation, whereas the latter was more strongly inhibited by diazepam. The effects of pentobarbital on the self-stimulation behavior were similar to those of diazepam. Methamphetamine facilitated both the tegmental and hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior. Suppressive effect of hypothalamic stimulation on the tegmental self-stimulation behavior was inhibed by chlorpromazine, while those of amygdaloid and septal stimulation were augmented. All the effects of hypothalamic, amygdaloid and septal stimulating on the tegmental self-stimulation behavior were inhibed by diazepam and pentobarbital, while these were facilitated by methamphetamine. Suppressive effects of tegmental, amygdaloid and septal stimulation on the hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior were all facilitated by both chlorpromazine and methamphetamine. The effects of amygdaloid and septal stimulation on this behavior were inhibed by diazepam and pentobarbital, while those of tegmental stimulation were enhanced. The effects of imipramine, in all experiments, were variable in each rat and not significant.", 
    "15": "Ten subjects received 10 and 20-mg. doses of diazepam intravenously. The plasma levels of the drug and its major metabolite, desmethyl-diazepam were measured and coordinated with answers to a subjective questionnaire. After initial rapid decline of the diazepam level, the level and shape of the remaining part of individual plasma curves showed considerable variance. Increases in diazepam levels were minute (0.04 plus or minus 0.03 mcg./ml.). Desmethyl-diazepam levels continued to build up until the end of sampling. Contrary to some previous reports, no recurrent drowsiness was evident after initial recovery. Correlation between plasma levels of diazepam and some of the subject's moods was significant. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine whether plasma levels can be meaningfully related to various cerebral effects of the drug.", 
    "16": "Taste aversions reflect the association of drug-produced noxious interoceptive stimuli with distinctive tastes. In the present experiments, taste aversions to sweetened condensed milk were induced in rats by a wide range of doses of the hypnotic drugs, hexobarbital, amobarbital, chloral hydrate, flurazepam and methaqualone and by anesthetization with ethyl ether. Observation of changes in motor behavior following drug administration could not be used to predict the development of taste aversions. Despite the fact that hypnotic drugs have punishing properties, which these paradox is discussed in terms of procedural differences between taste aversion and self-administration experiments.", 
    "17": "Chlormethiazole and diazepam as intravenous sedatives were compared in 75 patients undergoing fibre-endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Diazepam was considered to offer greater reliability and ease of administration. Chlormethiazole wqs found to be a safe drug and did not encourage salivation. Local pain caused by chlormethiazole injection can be abolished by the use of lignocaine. Chlormethiazole may be useful in patients who are hypotensive and who require emergency endoscopy.", 
    "18": "Plasma diazepam can be reliably estimated using a simple benzene extraction and gas-liquid chromatography with griseofulvin as internal standard. This gives reproducible results within the clinical range of plasma levels. Storage at minus 20 degrees C is recommended but is not essential for the 1st week.", 
    "19": "Diazepam was shown to be highly efficient in preventing the convulsive siezures induced by thiosemicarbazide and connected with GABA insufficiency. In recording the recovery cycles of the intracortical response of the cat motor cortex it was found that diazepam induced a decrease of the testing respone. These data indicate the enhancement of the inhibitory processes. Using this test an antagonistic relationship was observed between diazepam on the one hand, and biculline and thiosemicarbazide--on the other Diazepam was capable of increasing GABA content in the brain by suppressing GABA-transaminase activity in the mitochondrial fraction of the brain tissue.", 
    "20": "Associations between drug consumption during pregnancy and the birth of children with oral clefts were studied in material from the Finnish Register of Congenital Malformations, consisting of 599 children with clefts and their matched controls. Information concerning maternal drug consumption was partly prospective. During the first trimester, analgesic, chemotherapeutic and antineurotic drugs had all been significantly more frequently used by the mothers of children with clefts, than by the control mothers. The consumption of drugs was in general more frequent among mothers of children with cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, than among those of children with cleft palate alone.", 
    "21": "Patients with mixtures of anxiety and depressive mood of rather modest degree constitute a majority in the psychiatric outpatient population. Drug treatments are employed to produce symptomatic relief. In this study, thirteen commonly used psychotherapeutic drugs were compared for efficacy in producing change in symptoms of anxiety, depressive mood, and psychomotor activation level in this most common type of psychiatric clinic patient. The drugs were found to differ in relative effect on anxiety and depressive mood. Paradoxically, the major and minor tranquilizers produced greater effect on depressive mood than anxiety, while the more sedative of the tricyclic antidepressants produced relatively greater effect on anxiety. Within each of the three major drug classes, the more sedative members of the class tended to have relatively greater effect on anxiety and the less sedative tended to have relatively greater effect on depressive mood components of the symptom picture.", 
    "22": "Plasma diazepam levels were estimated by gas-liquid chromatography following a single 10 mg dose administered to a health adult female population by the oral and intramuscular routes. The highest levels were achieved following oral administration, reaching a peak at 60 minutes, although injection into the thigh resulted in a more rapid rise initially. Injection into this site produced higher levels than when the buttock was used. Injection by nurses into the latter site produced particularly low plasma levels over the 90-minute period of study. The plasma levels found at 90 minutes following the oral and thigh routes were found to be closely correlated with the weight of the patient.", 
    "23": "The relative efficacy of diazepam 10 mg as a premedicant was assessed following its oral and intramuscular administration, using a \"double-blind, double-dummy\" technique, as well as its effect when given by both routes. Drugs were given to a standard patient population who were undergoing the same type of operation and receiving a standard anaesthetic. The most rapid onset of soporific action occurred when diazepam was given by mouth and this produced the best effect throughout the period of the study although its efficacy began to pass off after 60 minutes. It was superior in effect to the same dose injected into the thigh. The combined effect of oral and intramuscular diazepam was not notably greater than tht of the single oral dose. The injection of diazepam was followed by an unacceptably high incidence of pain, particularly when this was given into the thigh. There were no significant differences in either the course of anaesthesia or the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting. When the undesired effects are taken into consideration, the oral administration of diazepam should be the route of choice.", 
    "24": "Clonazepam, a chlorinated derivative of nitrazepam, was administered to 10 children with absence seizures. Serum concentrations were measured after 8 weeks of treatment, at steady state. Seizure frequency reports and the 12-hour telemetered electroencephalogram were studied before and after 8 weeks of treatment to determine the frequency and duration of generalized spike-wave paroxysms. The clonazepam dosage ranged from 0.028 to 0.111 mg per kilogram and was reflected in serum levels ranging from 13 to 72 ng per milliliter, with an excellent correlation between dose and serum level. Eight of the 10 patients showed a significant decrease in seizure frequency, with three experiencing no seizures at all. Six patients had side effects, predominantly drowsiness and ataxia. This preliminary study shows clonazepam to be useful in the treatment of absence seizures in children and to merit further study.", 
    "25": "Responses to stress were reduced significantly in healthy volunteer subjects when diazepam was used as a sedative. Decreases in response to painful stimuli in a nontreated group averaged 17 percent; decreases in response to the stimuli in the group sedated with diazepam averaged 84 percent.", 
    "26": "The early recognition of dementia along with consideration of differential diagnosis and elucidation of its underlying causes is of paramount importance because many of these conditions are remediable, given proper diagnosis and adequate treatment. The purpose of this article is to emphasize possible alternatives to the grim sentence of slowly progressive irreversible deterioration of personality and intellect when the verdict of dementia is pronounced.", 
    "27": "The case histories of four patients who developed choreoathetoid movements during intoxication with phenytoin are presented. Drug intoxication was confirmed in each case by measuring the serum phenytoin concentration. Drug interactions were, in part, responsible for the occurrence of intoxication in three of them. Phenytoin intoxication is not always easy to recognize, particularly when nystagmus is minimal or absent, as in these four patients. The estimation of the serum phenytoin concentration is invaluable in this situation.", 
    "28": "The use of the standard 4-mm cuffed endotracheal tube to deliver manually or mechanically interrupted jets of oxygen or nitrous oxide and oxygen into the trachea allowed bronchoscopy and other related procedures to be performed with advantage to the patient, the surgeon and the anawsthetist. This paper describes the equipment used and the advantages obtained.", 
    "29": "Some further results on the effects of the two hypnotic drugs, nitrazepam and flurazepam monohydrochloride, on mood state are described. An automated assessment and scoring system, Computer Assisted Psychometric System (C.A.P.S.), was used to assess mood state and showed that both hypnotics had a mild euphoriant effect even when administered to healthy volunteers during the daytime. This was most marked in the case of nitrazepam. It is argued that such euphoriant side effects should be further investigated as they can occur when hypnotics are administered on a long-term nightly basis, and there may therefore be a dependency aspect for those patients who habitually take such hypnotic drugs. The broad scope of the C.A.P.S. system is also discussed.", 
    "30": "The excretion and metabolism of lorazepam was studied in domestic cats. After oral administration of 14-C-lorazepam (1 mg/kg), the mean percent of the dose excreted in urine was 47.3 plus or minus 6.7% (SD) and in feces 54.0 plus or minus 6.1% (SD). The main urinary metabolite was lorazepam glucuronide; its mean excretion over the first 3 days amounted to 29% of the dose (66% of urinary radioactivity). When 20 mg of unlabeled drug per kg was given, about 40% of the dose was excreted into urine as lorazepam glucuronide within 6 days. Conculsive evidence for the glucuronide structure was obtained by chemical analysis and mass spectrometry of the lorazepam conjugate isolated from cat urine. The radioactivity in urine which was not attributable to several minor metabolites. In plasma, both lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide were present. These findings indicate that the cat is capable of using glucuronidation as a major route of conjugation, contrary to the many reports that cats conjugate exogenous materials poorly with glucuronic acid.", 
    "31": "Handicapped adults can be grouped into those who are mentally subnormal, those with major organic disease, those who are emotionally disturbed and those for whom local anaesthesia is unsuccessful. At the first visit the degree of handicap and the state of the mouth are assessed and a plan of treatment is formulated. In most of the patients, satisfactory conditions for operating can be achieved by the use of intravenous diazepam and local anaesthesia, though some may require a full general anaesthetic. The results of treatment of a group of 139 patients are analysed and it is shown that the average DMF score in handicapped adults is appreciably higher than in normal adults of the same age. The reason for the inability of some of these patients to seek and accept dental treatment under normal surgery conditions is discussed and it is shown that with suitable initial treatment many of them become able to accept treatment in the ordinary circumstances of a dental surgery.", 
    "32": "A survey conducted at 12 VA hospitals included the collection of detailed information on the use of psychoactive drugs in 1,276 elderly psychiatric patients. On the day of the survey, 61 per cent of the patients were receiving psychoactive drugs. Prescription practices relating to the choice of drugs, prevalence of drug use, dosage, combination drug preparations, and antiparkinson agents are discussed in terms of such factors as the patient's age and the diagnosis. Also discussed is the literature on psychoactive drugs, particularly as it pertains to elderly populations.", 
    "33": "Vastus lateralis muscle was excised from normal pigs and from pigs susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Anesthesia consisted of diazepam, N2O:O2, and a lidocaine field block. In the susceptible (MHS) pigs, respiratory control in mitochondria of excised muscle was normal, while electron transport was accelerated. Glutamate log Q3's and log Q4's were in inverse linear relationship to porcine weights. In the presence of glutamate, state 3 respiration was 3.5 times, and state 4 respiration 3.2 times, higher in MHS than in normal mitochondria (independent of weight or halothane dose). Thus, the MHS mitochondria were able to produce ATP more efficiently than normal mitochondria. In vitro, halothane inhibited glutamate Q3's and R.C.I.'s, slightly increased succinate Q3's and R.C.I.'s, had no significant effect on glutamate or succinate Q4's, and, moderately lowered glutamate and succinate P/O ratios. These changes were similar to those observed in normal pigs. Calcium uptake into MHS mitochondria was markedly less than normal but was not significantly altered by in-vitro halothane. These results suggest a mitochondrial membrane component for the defect of procine malignant hyperthermia since calcium is normally associated with the formation of the phospholipid lattice of this membrane. (Key words: Hyperthermia, malignant; Metabolism, mitochondrial; Muscle, skeletal, mitochondria; Anesthetics, volatile, halotbane; Ions, calcium.)", 
    "34": "The 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives (diazepam, nitrazepm, lorazepam, clonazepam and two newly synthetized compounds of this series) increase the resistance of albino rats and rabbits to the toxic effect of oxygen under high pressure (7 and 5.5 atm respectively). The compounds under study are apt to avert over a long period the development of metabolic acidosis which appears following the action of high-pressure oxygen on the body.", 
    "35": "In 1958-72, 985 cases of tetanus (excluding tetanus of the newborn) were admitted to a hospital in Haiti. Mortality was 22%, and in later years (1966-72) mortality fell. During this period the dosage of tetanus antitoxin was lowered to 10,000 units and, for sedation, diazepam has satisfactorily replaced multiple-drug regimens used in earlier years. However, good nursing, including close attention to breathing, is probably the most important item in treatment. As a result of a programme of maternal immunisation, admissions for neonatal tetanus have fallen, and mortality for this condition has been reduced to 26%.", 
    "36": "The use of Amberlite XAD resins for isolation of drugs from blood without preliminary precipitation of proteins is described. Compared with the usual methods of precipitation this method gives better yields and cleaner extracts in a shorter time. In combination with specific methods of detection, e.g. with GC and Nitrogen detector, the use of XAD promises to be efficient in the screening for drugs in the forensic and clinical field.", 
    "37": "A controlled trial of antepartum glucocorticoid treatment for prevention of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants was carried out. 37 mothers, in whom premature delivery threatened between 28 and 37 weeks of gestation, were given intramuscular injections 8-12 mg of betamethasone as well as medication inhibiting uterine activity and strict bedrest to delay premature delivery for at least 24 to 48 hours. In comparison with a control group of 16 mothers, who received tocolytic and sedative medication and were on strict bedrest and another control group of 42 untreated patients, there was no difference in the 3 groups concerning the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants, but there was a lower perinatal mortality rate of respiratory distress syndrome in the betamethasone treated group, than in the controls, possibly due to a milder course of respiratory distress syndrome disease by accelerating functional maturation of the fetal lung with betamethasone.", 
    "38": "This study investigates the separate effects of age and hepatocellular liver disease on the disposition and elimination of diazepam (Valium) in man. The drug was given either by rapid intravenous injection (0.1 mg/kg) or orally (10 mg) to 33 normal volunteers rnaging in age from 15 to 82 yr as well as to 9 individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis, 8 with acute viral hepatitis, and 4 with chronic active hepatitis. In the normal individuals, the terminal plasma half-life of diazepam, (t 1/2 (B)) exhibited a striking age-dependence; at 20 yr the t 1/2 (beta) was about 20 h, but it increased linearly with age to about 90 h at 80 yr. The plasma clearance of diazepam in the majority of the normal subjects was between 20 and 32 ml/min and showed no significant age-dependence. Cigarette smoking did not affect the half-life or the clearance. Additionally, neither the plasma binding (97.4 plus or minus 1.2%, mean plus or minus SD) nor the blood/plasma concentration ratio (0.58 plus or minus 0.16) of diazepam showed any age-related changes (P greater than 0.05). By contrast, analysis of the intravenous data according to a two-compartment open model indicated that both the initial distribution space (V1) and the volume of distribution at steady state [Vd(ss)] of diazepam increased linearly with age (P less than 0.005). The increase in Vd(ss) was secondary to the change in V1. It appears then that the prolongation of t 1/2 (beta) of diazepam with age is primarily dependent on an increase in the initial distribution volume of the drug. The plasma concentration/time course of the metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, was also affected by age. In older individuals, the initial presence and the peak values of desmethyldiazepam were observed later and the metabolite was present in lower concentrations. Despite the profound prolongation of t 1/2 (theta) with age, the constancy of diazepam clearance indicates that drug plasma concentrations will not accumulate any more in the old than the young, and chronic dosage more in the old than the young, and chronic dosage modifications based on pharmacokinetic considerations are unnecessary. Data obtained in patients with liver disease were compared with those found in age-matched control groups. Patients with cirrhosis showed a more than twofold prolongation in the half-life of diazepam (105.6 plus or minus 15.2 vs. 46.6 plus or minus 14.2 h, P less than 0.001)."
