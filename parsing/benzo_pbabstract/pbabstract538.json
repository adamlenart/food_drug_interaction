The heterogeneity of the muscarinic receptors was examined both in vivo and in radioligand binding experiments. To study whether the receptors present in the investigated tissues are indeed distinct subtypes we determined the potencies of antagonists in both systems. It is proposed that there are three different binding sites present in hippocampal, atrial and submandibular membranes and we suggest to classify them as M1, M2 and M3, respectively. Both in vivo and in vitro pirenzepine appears to possess high affinity for M1 receptors, whereas 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide and dicyclomine show high affinity for both M1 and M3 receptors. AF-DX 116 (11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) displayed high affinity for M2 receptors.", 
    "1": "The contribution of research with lactate infusion to an understanding of agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder (PD) was reviewed. Lactate-induced panic seems to differentiate panic disorder from generalized anxiety disorder. Panic disorder seems to have important links to depression; both respond to tricyclic antidepressant drugs and neither responds well to the benzodiazepine antianxiety drugs. Response to pharmacotherapy, epidemiological surveys, and familial studies support the distinction between panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and the overlap between major depression and panic disorder. Understanding the mechanism of lactate-induced attacks may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of naturally occurring panic.", 
    "2": "This paper presents a discussion of handwriting in the amnestic state through two case reports associated with the phenomenon of anterograde amnesia following the use of therapeutic doses of triazolam, a rapid acting oral sleep inducing benzodiazepine. The fact that an individual executing a contract or signing a document may have no recollection of the writing event has significant implications for the questioned document examiner and other forensic science specialists. Since the issue of amnestic states and handwriting has received little apparent discussion in the forensic science literature, this paper outlines a number of issues of concern to the forensic science specialist.", 
    "3": "A fatality following ingestion of the tricyclic antidepressant carpipramine (Prazinil) and ethyl alcohol is described. Carpipramine was quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of carpipramine was 2.0 mg/L in blood and 0.44 mg/L in urine. Ethyl alcohol was measured by headspace gas chromatography and found to be 105 mg/dL in blood and 55 mg/dL in the urine. Quantitative analysis of stomach contents was positive for carpipramine by thin-layer chromatography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported fatality involving carpipramine.", 
    "4": "Mechanisms responsible for disproportional sedation resulting from triazolam administration to patients with cirrhosis were investigated. Ordinary sedative doses (0.25 mg) were given p.o. to 8 cirrhotics and 18 controls. Plasma concentrations of unbound drug were assessed by capillary gas chromatography and equilibrium dialysis. Median apparent oral clearances of unbound triazolam were 14.8 ml per min per kg in cirrhotics and 23.9 ml per min per kg in controls (p less than 0.01). Clearances were significantly correlated with severity of liver disease as assessed by the aminopyrine breath test (Rs = 0.77, n = 17, p less than 0.001). At a time when plasma concentrations of unbound triazolam were the same in both groups, i.e., 2.25 hr after dosing, flicker sensitivity at 5 Hz which was used as an index of CNS performance was impaired by a factor of 3.2 in cirrhotics and 1.4 in controls (p less than 0.01 for group difference). Performance was also significantly lower in cirrhotics with the digit symbol substitution test (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that, in patients with cirrhosis, disproportional sedation after benzodiazepine administration may be due not only to impaired drug elimination, but also to hypersensitivity of the brain.", 
    "5": "The effects of midazolam-pentobarbital and midazolam-thiopental combinations on the righting reflex were studied in rats. Doses that block the righting reflex for the agents given alone and for their combinations were determined with a probit procedure and compared with an isobolographic analysis. Interactions between pentobarbital or thiopental and midazolam were found to be synergistic (supra-additive). The degree of synergism was almost identical with both combinations. The ability of barbiturates to increase the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors to midazolam may be the underlying mechanism for the observed synergism.", 
    "6": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam was studied in 21 children undergoing elective surgery at five different dose levels for induction of general anesthesia and were compared with a control group (n = 6) given thiopental, 5 mg/kg. The clearance of midazolam was found to be dose-related. The elimination half-life varied from 0.79 to 2.83 hr, which is shorter than in adult patients. Even a dose of 0.6 mg/kg midazolam was found to be unreliable as an agent for induction of anesthesia. Compared with thiopental 5 mg/kg, significantly longer times of onset to closing of the eyes (P less than 0.01) and the disappearance of eyelid reflex (P less than 0.01) were seen with midazolam.", 
    "7": "Midazolam, a water soluble benzodiazepine derivative, inhibited the motility of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae in vitro at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 micrograms/ml. The effect was proportional to the concentrations used. Microfilariae regained motility after elimination of midazolam by washing. Diethylcarbamazine did not alter the midazolam effect. It is suggested that the Mazzotti reaction as the sequelae of diethylcarbamazine is caused by transient increased microfilarial migration. Combining midazolam with the diethylcarbamazine medication may prevent the Mazzotti reaction.", 
    "8": "The light-dark cycle is the major synchronizing agent for circadian rhythms in animals. After an abrupt shift in the light-dark cycle, it usually takes many days for circadian rhythms to resynchronize. A single injection of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, to hamsters subjected to an 8-h advance of the light-dark cycle resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in the time taken for the circadian locomotor activity rhythm to be resynchronized to the new lighting schedule. These results suggest that it may be possible to use drugs to facilitate the resynchronization of human circadian rhythms following an abrupt change in environmental time.", 
    "9": "Three acutely psychotic patients with psychomotor excitement and agitation were rapidly sedated following intramuscular injections of 2.5 mg to 3 mg of midazolam. The use of midazolam, a short- and rapid-acting benzodiazepine preparation, in a psychiatric emergency room setting is discussed.", 
    "10": "In 11 neurological patients, levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were determined in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before and 1, 3, 5, and 8 min after intravenous injection of diazepam (2 or 5 mg). GABA levels increased progressively after intravenous injection of 5 but not 2 mg of the benzodiazepine, the differences from preinjection values being significant at 3, 5, and 8 min. Furthermore, when relative CSF GABA alterations determined after injection of diazepam were compared to those determined in sequential CSF aliquots of 10 patients without diazepam injection, mean GABA increases after diazepam were significantly different from controls in all CSF fractions. The data suggest that, in addition to its well-known effects on postsynaptic GABA function, diazepam may exert effects on endogenous GABA concentrations and/or on GABA release in the human CNS as reflected by elevation of GABA levels in human CSF.", 
    "11": "The ability of various drugs to prevent the onset of status epilepticus induced by administration of the muscarinic agonist, pilocarpine, to lithium-pretreated rats was determined. Motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus occurred in 100% of rats administered pilocarpine (30 mg/kg, s.c.) 20 h after pretreatment with lithium (3 meq/kg, i.p.). The latency to spike activity and to status epilepticus was 20 +/- 1 min and 24 +/- 1 min, respectively. Atropine, diazepam, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, paraldehyde, and L-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA) prevented all phases of seizure activity induced by lithium/pilocarpine treatment. The initiation of status epilepticus was significantly prolonged by pretreatment with sodium valproate. These findings indicate that the seizures induced by administration of lithium and pilocarpine accurately model generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy. The anticonvulsant activity of L-PIA was prevented by prior treatment with the adenosine antagonist, theophylline. The latency to spike and seizure activity was decreased by theophylline, indicating that endogenous adenosine may have a tonic inhibitory influence on cholinergic neurons. Atropine, diazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate, L-PIA, and carbamazepine did not interrupt seizure activity when administered 60 min after pilocarpine (approximately 35 min after initiation of status epilepticus). When rats were administered paraldehyde at this time, status epilepticus was rapidly terminated and all rats survived. Thus, status epilepticus induced by lithium and pilocarpine provides a seizure model that is not responsive to conventional anticonvulsants.", 
    "12": "In previous articles we have reported on the total Acute Panic Inventory (API) score during lactate-induced panic. Even patients with panic disorder who do not panic during lactate infusion have higher API scores during the infusion than normal controls. In this post hoc analysis, we wished to determine whether specific API items were more sensitive to the beneficial effects of antipanic medication, either at baseline or during the infusion, in these lactate-insensitive panic patients. Four of the 17 items showed specific drug blockade of baseline severity. Five additional items showed specific drug blockade of lactate exacerbation of symptom severity. Medication apparently had no effect on severity of the remaining eight items. We suggest that the nine symptoms that responded to drug therapy are associated with hyperventilation. The study indicates that antipanic drugs may have a specific effect in blunting hyperventilation.", 
    "13": "The effect of midazolam on the field potentials (FPs) in the caudal part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus following strong electrical stimulation of the upper lip was investigated in Wistar albino rats. The rats received i.p. dosages of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg midazolam, or physiological saline. Relative amplitudes of the negative deflection were not suppressed after midazolam injection. No significant differences were found in the latencies of the potentials before and after midazolam injection. It is suggested that the main action site of midazolam may be located at a higher level than the spinal trigeminal nucleus.", 
    "14": "In a randomized crossover study on sedation in outpatient oral surgery, the relation between the serum profile and the drug effect profile for intravenously (i.v.) and rectally administered diazepam was studied. Both sedation methods were found to be equally efficient at a mean dose of 0.25 mg/kg (range, 0.14-0.45) for i.v. administration, and 0.53 mg/kg (range, 0.50-0.58) for rectal administration. Both the serum concentration and the effect reached their mean peaks at the same time; however, this was 15 min later after rectal sedation than after i.v. sedation. Intravenous administration yielded a significantly higher serum concentration of diazepam at the clinical endpoint than did rectal administration, but the mean effect levels at the clinical endpoint were equal for both sedation methods. No linear correlation between log-serum concentration and the patient's estimation of effect was found.", 
    "15": "We studied two patients with nonfamilial olivopontocerebellar atrophy with skeletal myoclonus. Palatal or skeletal myoclonus is probably not a coincidental finding but another manifestation of the underlying disease. In both cases, the myoclonus was suppressed by administration of trihexyphenidyl, indicating a cholinergic disorder.", 
    "16": "ICI 118551, a selective beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, was compared with placebo and propranolol in a double-blind cross-over trial in 11 chronically anxious patients, 8 of whom were continued on benzodiazepines. Each treatment was given for 1 week and there was a significant improvement in anxiety ratings (p less than 0.01) at the end of the 3-week trial. However there was no significant difference between the 3 treatments and no preference by either patients or doctor for any one treatment could be detected. Thus, under the conditions of this study, no beneficial effects of either selective or non-selective beta-blockade on chronic anxiety could be detected. Some previous studies with beta-blockers may have confused an effect on anxiety with an effect on benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "17": "Two cases of tetanus are presented, and the diagnosis, clinical features, and management of tetanus are reviewed. The first patient, an 86-year-old woman, had marked muscle rigidity but was able to breathe spontaneously. A dark eschar with purulent drainage was noted on her left foot, but Clostridium tetani was not isolated. She was placed in a semidark room and was treated with penicillin G; tetanus immune globulin (TIG) 5000 units i.m.; tetanus toxoid 0.5 mL i.m.; diazepam, chlorpromazine, and morphine for sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia; ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis; heparin for prevention of deep-vein thrombosis; and peripheral-vein nutrition. Her condition improved gradually, and she was discharged to a rehabilitation institute after 32 days. The second patient, a 46-year-old woman, experienced progressive descending paralysis and required ventilatory support. She had a periodontal abscess, but cultures of the drainage were negative. She was placed in a semidark room and treated with erythromycin, TIG, tetanus toxoid, diazepam, pancuronium bromide, morphine, ranitidine, and heparin. Autonomic instability occurred during the second and third weeks, but cardiac output was maintained without treatment. The patient was extubated after five weeks, and was transferred out of the intensive-care in the following week. The diagnosis of tetanus is based primarily on characteristic findings of muscle rigidity and reflex spasms; cultures for C. tetani are of limited value. A history of trauma or injury is common. Pulmonary infections and cardiovascular instability are the most common complications. Therapy consists of ventilatory support; control of neuromuscular symptoms with benzodiazepines, narcotics, and neuromuscular blockers; antibiotic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, dosage, and cost and availability of midazolam hydrochloride are reviewed. The anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, muscle-relaxant, and amnesic properties of midazolam are similar to those of other injectable benzodiazepines. Midazolam is approximately two to four times as potent as diazepam. Midazolam hydrochloride is water soluble (resulting in fewer local adverse reactions after injection), has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and causes relatively mild cardiovascular and respiratory effects. The drug generally is well tolerated. Midazolam is a good premedicant for general or regional anesthesia. Its greatest use will probably be for conscious sedation during surgical or diagnostic procedures performed under local or regional anesthesia. Induction of anesthesia with midazolam alone is somewhat unpredictable; opiate pretreatment makes induction more consistent. Midazolam is a less reliable induction agent than thiopental, but because it produces fewer adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects than thiopental, midazolam appears to be a safer induction agent for elderly patients or patients with cardiovascular disease. The recommended dose of midazolam for preoperative sedation is 0.07-0.1 mg/kg given by intramuscular injection one hour before surgery. For conscious sedation, 0.1-0.15 mg/kg intravenously in divided doses is usually adequate. Lower doses of midazolam are recommended for elderly or debilitated patients and patients who have severe liver disease. The costs of equipotent doses of midazolam and injectable diazepam are similar. An oral dosage form is under investigation in the United States. Midazolam's pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic profile makes it an attractive alternative to other injectable benzodiazepines used in anesthesia.", 
    "19": "In 60%-90% of cases head injury is a part of multisystem trauma and of very decisive importance for the post-traumatic prognosis. Hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hypotension increase the primary lesion and cause secondary brain damage. Therefore, emergency measures must be directed to the essentials of sustaining vital functions, i.e. intubation/ventilation/oxygenation and stabilization of the circulatory system. All trauma-specific measures should avoid additional increases in intracranial pressure or should decrease it if already elevated. Moderate hyperventilation not only causes cerebral vasoconstriction with a concomitant decrease in intracranial blood volume and intracranial pressure, but also partly restores the disturbed cerebral autoregulation, and is therefore an important part of the emergency care and anesthetic procedure in patients with severe head injuries. It is supplemented by analgesia and sedation to prevent intracranial pressure increases due to painful external stimuli. Elevation of the head and upper part of the body by 30 degrees causes a decrease in intracranial pressure by decreasing intracranial blood volume due to improved venous return from the brain; however, this measure is to be applied only in stable circulatory conditions. The head should be put in mid-position avoiding sideways rotation, flexion, and hyperextension. Osmotically active agents are only indicated in emergency situations when there are signs of clinical deterioration. High-dose barbiturate therapy is reserved as a \"last resort\", under intensive care conditions, for controlling an otherwise intractable intracranial pressure rise. Calcium antagonists have no indication in this context. Anesthesia in patients with severe head injury must involve only those techniques that do not further increase an already elevated intracranial pressure. As inhalational anesthetics, including nitrous oxide, elevate the intracranial pressure to varying extents due to cerebral vasodilation with a concomitant rise in intracranial blood volume, these substances have to be avoided whenever raised intracranial pressure cannot be excluded. Narcotics, benzodiazepines, small dosages of barbiturates, and long-lasting muscle relaxants can be regarded as useful.", 
    "20": "The newer neuromuscular blocking drugs include vecuronium and atracurium. Vecuronium is a competitive neuromuscular blocking drug with a steroid nucleus. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg has an onset time of 2 minutes and provides surgical paralysis for 20 minutes. Recovery to 90% twitch height occurs in 40 to 50 minutes. Vecuronium has few adverse effects and its use is associated with cardiovascular stability. Atracurium is a competitive neuromuscular blocking drug which undergoes Hofmann degradation and ester hydrolysis in plasma. A dose of 0.6 mg/kg has an onset time of around 2 minutes and provides surgical paralysis for 20 to 30 minutes. Recovery to 90% twitch height occurs in 60 to 80 minutes. Histamine release, usually only localised, has been reported in association with the use of atracurium. The organ-independent metabolism of atracurium allows its use in standard dosage in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Edrophonium, although not a new drug, has recently been re-evaluated for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. In a dose of 0.5 mg/kg it has been shown to be as effective as neostigmine at reversing neuromuscular blockade after recovery has started (greater than 25% twitch height recovery). However, if blockade is profound (less than 10% recovery), edrophonium is less effective. Among the newer intravenous anaesthetics are propofol (disoprofol) and midazolam. In a dose of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg, propofol produces sleep rapidly with a prompt recovery in 4 to 6 minutes. Induction of anaesthesia may be associated with a transient apnoea and a fall in systolic pressure. The rapid recovery has led to its use for maintenance of anaesthesia. Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine which has been used as an anaesthetic agent. The dose needed to induce sleep varies widely (0.15 to 0.5 mg/kg); onset is slow (1.5 to 5 minutes), and recovery may be prolonged. Midazolam is also used in lower doses as a sedative. Ketamine, an intravenous induction agent, has recently been used intrathecally and extradurally to provide analgesia.", 
    "21": "Nausea and vomiting continue to be critical problems in cancer chemotherapy, although considerable progress has been made toward understanding the neuropharmacological mechanisms of vomiting and how chemotherapeutic agents and antiemetics affect these mechanisms. The principles of behavioural psychology have also been applied in an effort to understand and effectively manage these complications which have potentially serious consequences. For example, there is now some degree of rationality to our use of metoclopramide for cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting, the use of combination antiemetic regimens, and use of lorazepam for the prevention (albeit unproven) of anticipatory nausea and vomiting. It must be admitted, however, that our approach is for the most part still empirical. Selecting an antiemetic programme is not a simple task. The emetogenic potential of the chemotherapy being used, the presence of coexisting diseases, the potential toxicity of the antiemetic drug and whether antiemetic therapy is to take place in the hospital or in an outpatient setting, the familiarity of the clinician with the various antiemetic therapies, and cost are all factors which need to be considered. Although phenothiazines remain the standard treatment, they are of little value against chemotherapy programmes that produce moderate or severe problems. Newer pharmacological approaches including butyrophenones, cannabinoids, metoclopramide, high-dose corticosteroids, and benzodiazepines have shown increased antiemetic efficacy, as have combinations of these agents which are directed against multiple sites of emetogenic activity. The role of behavioural therapies, which have been shown to be effective particularly in children and in anticipatory nausea and vomiting, needs to be more firmly established. Rather than recommending a given antiemetic programme for any particular chemotherapy, it is preferable to think in terms of initial approaches and how they can be modified. No one antiemetic programme is effective or safe in all situations.", 
    "22": "To our knowledge, this is the first reported comparison of clonidine with benzodiazepine in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In a double-blind trial, 61 men experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to receive clonidine or chlordiazepoxide over a 60-hour treatment period. Clonidine was more effective than chlordiazepoxide at reducing alcohol withdrawal scale scores, systolic blood pressures, and heart rates over the entire study period. Clonidine was as good as chlordiazepoxide at improving Cognitive Capacity Screening Exam, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Self-Rating Scale scores. Adverse drug reactions reported by each group were similar, though less nausea and vomiting were observed in the clonidine group. Clonidine may represent a new alternative agent for the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "23": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized multiple crossover study was designed to determine the effectiveness of alprazolam in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. Patients maintained daily diaries of 22 premenstrual symptoms for one pretreatment control cycle and four treatment cycles. Alprazolam 0.25 mg or placebo was administered three times daily from cycle day 20 until the second day of menstruation, at which time the dosage was tapered by one tablet per day to minimize withdrawal effects. The results of the clinical trial indicate that alprazolam is significantly more effective than placebo in relieving the severity of premenstrual nervous tension, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, depression, fatigue, forgetfulness, crying, cravings for sweets, abdominal bloating, abdominal cramps, and headache. The low incidence of side effects makes alprazolam an acceptable treatment for premenstrual syndrome for those women unresponsive to other therapies.", 
    "24": "Six groups of patients (total 105), affected by cutaneous signs and symptoms related to food ingestion were studied with regards to the clinical efficacy of some pharmacologic treatments: blind placebo, terfenadine alone, terfenadine associated with pirenzepine or rosaprostol or ranitidine or famotidine. Pharmacologic treatment by terfenadine alone showed poor clinical results, similar to placebo, while the associations of terfenadine with both cytoprotective drugs and anti-H2 receptor antagonists revealed significant clinical improvement which is more evident in those patients treated with cytoprotective drugs combination than those who were treated with anti-H2 antagonists.", 
    "25": "Two forms of analgesia (opioid and non-opioid) are associated with social conflict in mice. The non-opioid form is seen in response to the scent of an aggressive conspecific or defeat experience, whilst the opioid form occurs in response to extended conspecific attack. Recently, it has been reported that the non-opioid reaction is dose-dependently blocked by diazepam and by Flumazepil (Ro15-1788; a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist). In view of the temporal relationship between these two reactions, the present study was conducted to determine whether activation of non-opioid substrates is a necessary precursor to the development of opioid analgesia. Results indicate that inhibition of non-opioid analgesia by diazepam (2-4 mg/kg), or by Flumazepil (20-40 mg/kg), does not alter the opioid analgesic reaction to conspecific attack. Findings are discussed in relation to the presumed adaptive significance of these biologically-meaningful forms of pain inhibition.", 
    "26": "The effects of repeated doses of benzodiazepines, diazepam and midazolam in combination with meperidine on arterial blood gases and transcutaneous PO2 were studied in eight healthy volunteers. The study was designed to mimic a clinical situation. Initially two doses of either midazolam 0.05 mg/kg or diazepam in fat emulsion 0.15 mg/kg were given in a randomized crossover fashion with a 20-min interval, followed by meperidine 0.5 mg/kg another 20 min later. The opioid effects were then antagonized by naloxone 0.4 mg. The initial doses of benzodiazepines caused an increase in PaCO2 and a decrease in PaO2. The changes in PaO2 were of short duration and recovered to baseline levels between injections. However, they came sooner and were more pronounced after midazolam. The changes in PtcO2 paralleled those in PaO2. The PtcO2 index as a measure of cardiac output and peripheral blood flow adequacy was increased immediately after the first injection of midazolam but was otherwise not different from control. There were no differences between the drugs concerning PtcO2 index. PaCO2 increased after the first benzodiazepine injection and remained so throughout the study. Addition of meperidine caused only small changes in PaO2 and PaCO2. These changes were reversed by naloxone. In spite of different elimination kinetics there was no difference in the duration of respiratory depression between the two benzodiazepines.", 
    "27": "Both placental and blood-lumbar CSF transfer of diazepam (5 mg orally) and its two metabolites, N-desmethyldiazepam and unconjugated oxazepam, was measured (by GLC) in 15 patients undergoing Caesarean section under spinal analgesia. Differing from our earlier studies with atropine (Virtanen et al. 1982; Kanto et al. 1981 & 1987), a reasonably fast penetration of diazepam and its two metabolites through the two biological membranes was found. Diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam and to a lesser extent unconjugated oxazepam accumulated on the foetal side of the placenta, apparently due to a higher degree of plasma protein binding in the foetus. No accumulation was found in CSF, probably due to the lack of binding proteins in this tissue compartment. Concerning atropine, lumbar CSF with an incomplete drug penetration was found to be a \"deeper\" compartment than amniotic fluid, but in the present study with diazepam there was no clear difference between these two tissue compartments.", 
    "28": "The present study's aim was to monitor the daily plasma levels of diazepam and its metabolites in two tetanic patients who were receiving very strong doses of diazepam in continuous infusion. The kinetics of high doses of diazepam were estimated. These plasma levels were determined selectively using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC), then correlated with a global estimation by radioreceptor-assay (RRA). At the end of the infusion, the kinetics of diazepam and of RRA active material were calculated using a linear, open, two compartment model. Muscle-relaxant and residual sedative effects were clinically monitored. The mean concentrations of diazepam (2.33, 0.60 micrograms/ml), desmethyldiazepam (3.27, 1.00 micrograms/ml) and oxazepam (0.73, 0.47 micrograms/ml) estimated by GLC and of RRA active material (5.62, 1.08 micrograms/ml) correlated better when active metabolites were considered (r = 0.898) than when diazepam alone was taken into account (r = 0.730), indicating that these metabolites influence the overall activity of the parent compound. Half-lives of RRA results (52.6 h for patient 1 and 82.5 h for patient 2) were higher than those of diazepam estimated using GLC results (21.2 h for patient 1 and 42.3 h for patient 2). This could be related to the contribution of the active metabolites and might explain the residual sedative effect observed for at least seven days following cessation of the diazepam (DZP) infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The effects of several benzodiazepine receptor ligands on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses and on diazepam (DZ) enhancement of GABA responses on mouse spinal cord and cerebral hemisphere neurons are reported. The neurons were grown in primary dissociated cell culture, and intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were used. DZ and Ro 15-1788 reversibly enhanced GABA responses from spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal enhancement was obtained for DZ at 500 nM (82%) and for Ro 15-1788 at 1 microM (18%). CGS 9896 and ZK 91296, in concentrations from 1 nM to 10 microM, were devoid of intrinsic effects in spinal cord and cerebral hemisphere neurons. CGS 8216 and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) reversibly and dose-dependently reduced GABA responses on spinal cord neurons. Maximal reduction was obtained for CGS 8216 at 50 nM (10%) and for DMCM at 1 microM (39%). CGS 8216 (IC50 = 2.6 nM), ZK 91296 (IC50 = 9 nM), CGS 9896 (IC50 = 17 nM) and Ro 15-1788 (IC50 = 40 nM) antagonized (100 nM) DZ enhancement of GABA responses in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, CGS 9896 antagonized the effects of Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 on GABA responses, and CGS 9896 and ZK 91296 antagonized the reduction of GABA responses by DMCM. On the studied neurons, DZ can be classified as an agonist, Ro 15-1788 as a weak partial agonist, CGS 8216 as a weak partial inverse agonist and DMCM as an inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor. CGS 9896 and ZK 91296 were pure antagonists at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "30": "Cultured granule cells prepared from 8-day postnatal rats were used for the study of carbachol-induced phosphoinositide turnover. The addition of carbachol induced a 20- to 30-fold increase in [3H]inositol monophosphate (IP1) accumulation within 30 min in the presence of 20 mM LiCl in granule cells prelabeled with [3H]myoinositol. Carbachol also stimulated the formation of [3H]inositol bisphosphate and [3H]inositol trisphosphate assayed either in the presence or in the absence of lithium; the increase in [3H]inositol triphosphate and [3H]inositol biphosphate synthesis appeared to be faster in the time course but much smaller in amount when compared with the formation of [3H]IP1. The EC50 of carbachol was approximately 7 microM, and the saturation concentration was about 100 microM. This carbachol-induced response was completely blocked by two muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, with a Ki of 0.5 and 120 nM, respectively. Saturation studies of the binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to mAChRs in intact granule cells revealed the presence of a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 140 and 126 pM, respectively, and a Bmax of approximately 70 fmol/10(6) cells for both ligands. Within 1 hr after pre-exposure of cells to carbachol, the subsequent carbachol-induced [3H]IP1 accumulation was reduced by about 50%, whereas mAChR binding, assessed by using either [3H]N-methylscopolamine or [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, was unchanged. A second slower phase of desensitization was associated with a loss of mAChR binding sites; at 18 hr, the decrease of responsiveness was about 80%, whereas the loss of mAChR sites was about 60%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Portal vein ligation (after prior subcutaneous transposition of the spleen) results in complete portal bypass of splanchnic blood. In addition, significant hepatocellular damage was superimposed on this model of portosystemic shunting by ligation of the common bile duct. Plasma GABA-like activity (determined by radioreceptor assay) and true plasma GABA concentrations (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography) were found to be significantly increased in both portal vein-ligated and portal vein and bile duct-ligated rats, compared with controls. However, plasma GABA-like activity was consistently greater than the concentration of true GABA in the plasma of all rats. This suggested the presence of a GABA-like factor in plasma that can inhibit [3H]GABA binding, but is not GABA itself. The concentration of this GABA-like factor was significantly increased in the plasma of rats with chronic hepatic encephalopathy. Despite the significant increase in plasma GABA-like activity and plasma GABA concentrations, there was no alteration in the affinity or density of the physiologically relevant, low-affinity brain GABA binding site in the rats with portal vein ligation, with or without bile duct ligation. There was also no significant alteration in brain benzodiazepine binding in these rats. GABA enhancement of benzodiazepine binding was unchanged in the portal vein-ligated rats. However, the maximal enhancement of benzodiazepine binding was decreased in the rats with portal vein and bile duct ligation. There appears to be no substantial evidence that brain GABAergic neurotransmission is increased in these models of chronic hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "32": "Slice preparations of rat cuneate nucleus were used for studies on the gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAA-receptor complex following chronic and acute pretreatment with GABA-alpha-ketoglutarate aminotransferase (GABA-T) inhibitors. The whole brain GABA concentration was significantly increased 2.9 fold and 2.6 fold following treatment with ethanolamine O-sulphate (EOS, orally) for 15-30 days and 56-64 days, respectively. One hour after a single injection of gamma-acetylenic GABA (GAG) i.p., there was a significant 2.1 fold increase in whole brain GABA. Superfusion of a slice with muscimol or the GABA uptake inhibitor nipecotic acid depolarized the afferent nerve fibres. These effects were potentiated by flurazepam (1 microM) and pentobarbitone (10 microM) and antagonized by picrotoxin (3 microM, 30 microM). Following 15-30 days of EOS-treatment, the depolarization response to muscimol was decreased and that to nipecotic acid increased. These changes were no longer significant by 56-64 days of pretreatment. The acute dose of GAG did not affect the depolarization response to muscimol but increased that to nipecotic acid. The potentiations of muscimol by flurazepam (1 microM) and pentobarbitone (10 microM) were enhanced following chronic EOS treatment (15-64 days). The enhancement of flurazepam was less after 56-64 days than after 15-30 days pretreatment whereas the enhancement of pentobarbitone was similar at both times. Acute GAG treatment had no effect. The potency of picrotoxin as an antagonist of muscimol was reduced following chronic EOS treatment; the enhancement was less after 56-64 days than after 15-30 days pretreatment. Acute GAG treatment caused only a very small reduction in picrotoxin potency. Possible adaptations in the GABAA-receptor complex and its modulation during chronic elevation of brain GABA are discussed.", 
    "33": "The abilities of some benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists to modulate the inhibitory potency of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A-receptor agonist, isoguvacine, on the CA1 population spike recorded from slices of rat hippocampus, were determined. Concentration-response curves were constructed of the extent to which the benzodiazepine-receptor ligands shifted the isoguvacine concentration-response curve to the left or right. These were compared to their displacement curves of [3H]-Ro15-1788 binding to rat hippocampal membranes under near physiological assay conditions. The above comparisons suggest that the effect on the potency of isoguvacine produced by the benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, diazepam and flunitrazepam, and the partial agonists, Ro16-6028 and Ro17-1812, closely parallels their degree of benzodiazepine-receptor occupancy. Thus, the partial agonists, Ro16-6028 and Ro17-1812, were unable to produce as large a maximum response as the full agonists, diazepam and flunitrazepam. The maximum effects produced by diazepam, flunitrazepam, Ro16-6028, Ro17-1812, the antagonist, propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, and the inverse agonist, methyl-6, 7-dimethyl-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), on the potency of isoguvacine in the hippocampal slice corresponded to the change in their affinities produced by the addition of GABA in the radioligand binding studies (GABA-shift). This suggests that the changes in affinity of benzodiazepine-receptor ligands produced by GABAA-receptor activation reflects their ability to modify GABAA-receptor function. The benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists, Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216, had apparent agonist and inverse agonist effects, respectively, on the potency of isoguvacine. These effects occurred at concentrations above those required for saturation of the benzodiazepine-receptor, as labelled by [3H]-Ro15-1788, and were not in agreement with the absence of any effect of GABAA-receptor stimulation in the GABA-shift experiments. This indicates that these events are not mediated by an action at the classical benzodiazepine-receptor site. 6 It is concluded that hippocampal GABAA-receptor function can be allosterically modulated in a manner consistent with the agonist/inverse-agonist model of benzodiazepine-receptor activation, and that compounds exist with varying efficacies throughout this range.", 
    "34": "The effect of baclofen, the GABAB-agent, on the potassium-evoked release of endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from slices of mouse frontal cortex has been investigated. The release of endogenous 5-HT evoked by addition of K+ (35 mM) was inhibited by (+/-)-baclofen in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.1 microM. Inhibition of K+-evoked release of 5-HT was produced by (+/-)- and (-)-baclofen but not (+)-baclofen. This action of the (-)-enantiomer was not altered by the presence of the (+)-enantiomer. Addition of GABA (0.1-10 microM) also induced a dose-dependent inhibition of 5-HT release. This effect was neither enhanced by flurazepam (1 microM) nor antagonized by bicuculline (10 microM). The progabide metabolite, 4-[( (4-chlorophenyl) (5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)methylene]amino)butyric acid (SL75.102) (1 microM) inhibited the K+-evoked release of 5-HT by 61%. These data suggest that baclofen is a potent inhibitor of the K+-evoked release of endogenous 5-HT from the cortex and further indicate that the release of 5-HT may be controlled by a GABAB-receptor located presynaptically.", 
    "35": "The binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors has been demonstrated in a highly purified preparation of alveolar type II cells. [3H]Ro5-4864 binding to guinea pig alveolar type II cells indicated one population of binding sites with high affinity (KD = 5.7 nM) and saturability (Bmax = 4582 fmol/mg membrane protein).", 
    "36": "The biologically active conformations of a series of four peptides [four cholecystokinin (CCK)-related peptides and enkephalin] in their interactions with gastrointestinal receptors have been deduced using conformational computational analysis. The two peptides that interact exclusively with peripheral-type CCK receptors are the heptapeptide COOH-terminal fragment from CCK (CCK-7) and the analogous sequence from cerulein (CER-7) in which threonine replaces the methionine proximal to the NH2 terminus. The two peptides that interact exclusively with the gastrin receptor in the stomach are the active COOH-terminal fragment of little gastrin and the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide sequence common to all of these peptides, CCK-4. We find that preferred conformations for the peripherally active peptides CCK-7 and CER-7 are principally beta-bends, whereas little gastrin and CCK-4 are fundamentally helical. In the class of lowest energy structures for both CCK-7 and CER-7, the aromatic rings of the tyrosine and phenylalanine lie close to one another whereas the tryptophan indole ring points in the opposite direction. This structure is superimposable on the structures of a set of rigid indolyl benzodiazepine derivatives that interact with complete specificity and high affinity with peripheral CCK receptors further suggesting that the computed beta-bends are the biologically active conformation. The biologically active conformation for CCK-4 and the little gastrin hexapeptide has also been deduced. By excluding conformations common to CCK-7 and CCK-4, which do not bond to each other's receptors, and then by selecting conformations in common to CCK-4 and the gastrin-related hexapeptide, which do bind to each other's receptors, we deduce that the biologically active conformation at the gastrin receptor is partly helical and one in which the indole of tryptophan and the aromatic ring of phenylalanine are close to one another while the methionine and aspartic acid side chains point in the opposite direction. These major differences in preferred structures between the common CCK-7/CER-7 peptides and the common CCK-4/little gastrin peptides explain the mutually exclusive activities of these two sets of peptides. We have observed that [Met]enkephalin strongly antagonizes the action of the naturally occurring peripherally active CCK-8 (CCK-7 with an NH2-terminal aspartic acid residue added). The computed lowest energy structures for this opiate peptide closely resemble key features of the computed CCK-7/CER-7 structure, further supporting the proposed structure.", 
    "37": "Hybrid molecules incorporating pharmacologically important structural features of both 3-carboxy-beta-carbolines and 1,4-benzodiazepines were synthesized, and their affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor were determined in vitro. One of these hybrids, 8,14-dioxo-13,14-dihydro-8H-indolo[3',2':4,5]pyrido[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine (13), demonstrated high affinity for the receptor, displacing both benzodiazepines (IC50 = 23 nM) and beta-carbolines (IC50 = 47 nM) from their binding sites. Of the compounds synthesized, 13 also most closely satisfied the structural requirements that generally ensure a high affinity of both beta-carbolines and benzodiazepines for the receptor (e.g., aromaticity of the beta-carboline, presence of a carbonyl at C-3 of the beta-carboline and of a pi 2-region on the benzodiazepine). The hybrids not fulfilling these requirements had no affinity for the receptor. In vivo pharmacological properties of 13 could not be demonstrated because of its metabolic instability and/or its poor transport into the brain. The results are discussed in terms of a possible overlapping of beta-carboline binding sites with those of benzodiazepines on the receptor.", 
    "38": "Intravenous sufentanil, an analog of fentanyl, was compared to diazepam for conscious sedation in ambulatory dental outpatients. Ten patients undergoing the surgical removal of impacted third molars served as subjects in a double-blind, within-subject, single crossover study. Sedation was achieved with a combination of 30% nitrous oxide/70% oxygen by nasal mask and either diazepam (0.05-0.15 mg/kg) or sufentanic (0.05-0.15 \u03bcg/kg) titrated to a clinical endpoint of altered speech and relaxation. Intraoperative physiologic monitoring, patients' and the oral surgeon's subjective estimates of efficacy and psychomotor recovery were used to compare the two treatments. Both patients (eight of 10) and surgeons (six of 10) preferred sufentanil sedation. No significant differences were noted between treatments for psychomotor recovery. These preliminary data in a small sample suggest that sufentanil produces adequate conscious sedation in dental outpatients and should be evaluated further with larger patient samples.", 
    "39": "Baseline cortisol levels at 8:00 a.m. and the cortisol responses at 90 and 120 min after oral administration of 200 mg 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (L-isomer, non-enteric-coated) were assessed in 65 depressed inpatients. Patients were categorized according to DSM-III as major (296.22; 296.32; 296.23; 296.33; 296.24; 296.34) and minor (300.40; 309.00; 296.82) depressives. We observed a significant rise of plasma cortisol in patients with major depression at 90 (P = 0.0001) and 120 (P = 0.002) min, but not in patients with minor depression. Patients with major depression showed significantly higher cortisol responses than those with minor depression (P = 0.016). This significant rise of plasma cortisol after 5-HTP could be attributed to sex-linked differences: we observed significant (P = 0.0065) rises in cortisol responses in women with major depression compared to depressed men and women with minor depression. These differences could not be attributed to age, concomitant benzodiazepine use or pre/postmenopausal status. Baseline cortisol correlated negatively with the cortisol response to 5-HTP. The increased cortisol responses in women with major depression remained significant even after the effects of baseline cortisol were partialled out. This rise in cortisol response can be explained by an increased responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to 5-HTP.", 
    "40": "Biotransformation and elimination of diazepam and four 3-hydroxy-benzodiazepines after i.v. injection in anaesthetized cats were investigated. Decay of plasma concentration of 3-hydroxy-benzodiazepines was slow and plasma concentrations of their glucuronides were lower than of unchanged parent compounds. In the urine, very low excretion rates of all investigated benzodiazepines were found during the first eight hours. It is concluded that cats poorly glucuronidate 3-dydroxy-benzodiazepines.", 
    "41": "Animal behavior in a free environment involves the orienting reflex, a major component of which is exploratory behavior. Exploration is an essential, life-preserving component of animal higher nervous functions and the experiments presented here show that exploratory behavior may differ according to the experimental subjects' emotional baseline. Exploratory performance may accordingly be affected differently by psychoactive drugs.", 
    "42": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) form a major part of the body's nonspecific first line of defense. An early event, prerequisite for the effective restriction of microbial invasions, is the chemotactic movement of activated neutrophils towards the invading organisms. To date, only limited and contradictory data exist regarding the effects of various intravenous anesthetic agents on neutrophil migration. In this study, the influence of ketamine, etomidate, midazolam, diazepam, and six commonly used i.v. barbiturates (hexo-, pheno-, pentobarbital, methohexital, thiopental, thiobutobarbital) on the in vitro motility of isolated human PMN was tested. Purified PMN (greater than 95%) were obtained from venous blood samples of healthy adults by dextran sedimentation, subsequent ammonium chloride treatment for red blood cell lysis, and Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. Random and chemotactic migration were assessed under 1% agarose in the presence of 10(-3)-10(-7) M logarithmic dilutions of the agents in antibiotic free migration medium (MEM). N-fMet-Leu-Phe (FMLP) served as the standardized chemical attractant (10(-7) M). PMN motility was unaffected by ketamine and etomidate, but a significant (P less than 0.001), dose - related depression could be observed with both benzodiazepines at concentrations exceeding 10(-5) M (Fig. 1). Except at 10(-3) M concentration, this migratory inhibition proved to be easily reversible (Fig. 3). At the highest concentration tested (10(-3) M), all the barbiturates caused a significant (P less than 0.001) but completely reversible depression of random as well as chemotactic PMN migration (Table 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Experiments were conducted to determine the degree of generality of previous findings that anxiolytics increased the ingestion of hypertonic saline in rehydrating rats. Further, potential differential effects amongst recently described benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists were explored. Finally, the hypothesis that benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonists would decrease the ingestion of hypertonic NaCl solution was tested. Results indicated that full agonists (midazolam, ZK 93423, zopiclone) produced substantial dose-related increases in hypertonic saline consumption. The putative 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone, produced only a dose-dependent decrease in saline intake. Partial agonists fell into two distinct categories: ZK 91296, CL 218,872 and two novel benzodiazepines, Ro16-6028 and Ro17-1812, also increased saline ingestion. In contrast, two pyrazoloquinolines, CGS 9896 and CGS 9895, had no significant effect on intake. Two compounds, CGS 8216 and FG 7142, described as benzodiazepine partial inverse agonists, did not significantly affect consumption of the hypertonic saline.", 
    "44": "Oral temazepam was compared with papaveretum and hyoscine for pre-operative medication. The oral premedication was associated with less subjective unpleasant side-effects and greater anxiolytic properties. It was adjudged to be superior by the anaesthetic and nursing staff as well as by the patients themselves. Oral premedication was also less time-consuming to administer, and there was a small saving in the cost of drugs and equipment.", 
    "45": "The utility of immobilized microsomal enzymes from rabbit liver for the synthesis of a variety of conjugated drug metabolites has been demonstrated in our laboratory. Here, this capability is extended to microsomal preparations from monkey and human liver. A comparative study of glucuronidation of various substrates was carried out using immobilized uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronyltransferase from rabbit, rhesus monkey, and human liver. The three drugs used for the study (sulfadimethoxine, oxazepam, and cyproheptadine) were chosen on the basis of their previously reported in vivo species differences in glucuronidation. Aglycons were incubated with UDP-glucuronic acid in the presence of immobilized UDP-glucuronyl-transferase at pH 7.4 for 16 hr at 37 degrees C. Glucuronide products were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and further characterized by thin layer chromatography and mass spectometry. Species-dependent glucuronidation was observed in all three cases. Differences in the in vitro product formation paralleled in vivo species differences for the three drugs studied. The same glucuronides were produced by immobilized human liver microsomes as have been found to be formed in vivo from the three drugs studied.", 
    "46": "During the past few years the problem of over-prescribing benzodiazepines has been increasingly discussed. However, up to now exact data on the extent of an abuse of these substances are relatively scarce and controversial. An analysis done at the Psychiatric State Hospital Weinsburg from 1974 to 1983 regarding the frequency of the diagnosis \"Benzodiazepine-dependence\" showed that in only 150 cases (0.5%) out of almost 33,000 admitted patients was the diagnosis benzodiazepine-abuse justified, with an increase since the year 1980. During a prospective study of the quarterly incidence in 1984, 18.5% of the patients admitted met the criterion of long-term use of benzodiazepines (continuous use for more than 3 months). Sociodemographic and clinical data are presented and an index of abuse/dependence is proposed.", 
    "47": "The authors describe 19 patients with severe tardive dyskinesia, 11 of whom had a diagnosis of affective or schizoaffective disorder rather than schizophrenia. Most patients had been receiving long-term neuroleptic treatment with few interruptions and had received only one or two different neuroleptics. Frequent eye blinking was the most prevalent prodromal sign of tardive dyskinesia (in seven patients). Four subtypes of tardive dyskinesia could be distinguished: choreoathetosis, tardive dystonia, blepharospasm, and tardive akathisia. Optimal pharmacotherapy most often consisted of combinations of neuroleptics, lithium carbonate, benzodiazepines, and antiparkinsonian drugs. However, after an average of 62 months, only five patients had markedly improved.", 
    "48": "A series of 3-substituted 5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepines, nonpeptidal antagonists of the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), have been synthesized. Designed on the basis of facts regarding CCK, its natural-product antagonist asperlicin (3), and the antianxiety agent diazepam (4), these compounds represent a significant departure from existing CCK antagonists. They also constitute perhaps the first examples of simple, nonpeptidal ligands for a peptide receptor to arise by design rather than by screening. These compounds serve to illuminate the distinction between central and peripheral CCK receptors, as well as to provide orally effective CCK antagonists of potential pharmacological or therapeutic utility. One rationale for their receptor affinity has possible applications in the design of nonpeptidal ligands for other receptors, peptidal as well as nonpeptidal.", 
    "49": "The ability of three benzodiazepine tranquilizers, diazepam, oxazepam and chlordiazepoxide chlorhydrate to block metabolic cooperation between human hepatoma cells was analysed using autoradiographical monitoring. Independent tests were performed with compound concentrations varying from 1 to 50 micrograms/ml. The results showed that at a toxic dose of 50 micrograms/ml diazepam and oxazepam markedly inhibited metabolic cooperation and that oxazepam remained effective at a lower, non-toxic, dose (10 micrograms/ml). Chlordiazepoxide chlorhydrate was found to be less toxic than diazepam and oxazepam and did not interfere with metabolic cooperation at any concentration up to 50 micrograms/ml.", 
    "50": "In our previous studies, we hypothesized that activation and subsequent collapse of GABA-mediated inhibition during tetanus is an important seizure-triggering mechanism in the kindled epileptogenic focus. To examine this hypothesis, in the present study, we investigated the effects of pharmacological manipulations of the kindled amygdala with several drugs, and measured the kindled seizures as well as the EEG events during tetanus. The results obtained were: (i) The selective GABA-A agonist, muscimol (1 and 5 nM/1 microliter), suppressed kindled seizures in a dose-dependent fashion, and the 5 nM muscimol significantly prolonged EEG suppression and reduced the number of oscillations in the subsequent rhythmic synchronous discharge. Similar effects followed systemic injection of diazepam (2 mg/kg). (ii) The selective GABA-B agonist, baclofen (5 nM), had no effect on kindled seizures nor on the EEG events during tetanus. (iii) The NMDA antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (80 nM), significantly reduced the afterdischarge duration and significantly delayed the appearance of the rhythmic synchronous discharge. However, these effects were not observed immediately, but 24 to 72 h after microinjection. (iv) The muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, atropine (40 and 80 nM), suppressed kindled seizures in a dose-dependent fashion, but the atropine caused marked synchronous discharge both in the awake resting EEG and during tetanic stimulation. We conclude that the GABA-A system, including the benzodiazepine system, is more involved in the seizure-triggering mechanism of amygdala kindling than the GABA-B system, that there is an interaction between the GABA-A and NMDA system, and that the cholinergic participation is independent of the primary seizure-triggering mechanisms.", 
    "51": "Neuronal cortical cell cultures obtained from fetal mice were subjected to increasing concentrations of sodium cyanide (10-500 microM) for 6 days in order to simulate prolonged partial asphyxia. Various neurochemical assays were performed to determine if certain cell types were preferentially more affected. Choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced significantly from control values at cyanide concentrations greater than 100 microM; there were similar reductions on a percentage basis in high-affinity uptake of beta-alanine and GABA and in clonazepam-displaceable benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding which reflected the neuronal BDZ receptor population. Ro5-4864-displaceable BDZ binding, a nonneuronal marker, was increased significantly. More modest reductions were apparent in specific BDZ binding and in protein content. Although a particular vulnerability of a specific cell type was not demonstrated, there was more neurochemical than morphologic evidence of cellular dysfunction. Co-exposure of the cultures to magnesium along with the highest concentrations of cyanide substantially prevented both neurochemical and morphologic abnormalities. These results lend further support to the concept that excitatory neurotransmitters may be implicated in the neuronal damage produced by hypoxia.", 
    "52": "Applied to seven potent benzodiazepine-receptor ligands belonging to chemically different classes, the active analog approach allowed the stepwise identification of the pharmacophoric pattern associated with the recognition by the benzodiazepine receptor. A unique pharmacophore model was derived which involves six critical zones: (a) a pi-electron rich aromatic (PAR) zone; (b) two electron-rich zones delta 1 and delta 2 placed at 5.0 and 4.5 A respectively from the reference centroid in the PAR zone; (c) a freely rotating aromatic ring (FRA) region; (d) an out-of-plane region (OPR), strongly associated with agonist properties; and (e) an additional hydrophobic region (AHR). The model accommodates all presently known ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor, identifies sensitivity to steric hindrance close to the delta 1 zone, accounts for R and S differential affinities and distinguishes requirements for agonist versus non-agonist activity profiles.", 
    "53": "Administration of diazepam (10 mg i.m.) to seven children (two girls and five boys) affected by infantile autism elicited paradoxical behavioural responses. Mainly, anxiogenic effect, unsocialized aggressive behaviour and explosive aggression were dramatically increased in comparison with the same symptoms present before and after treatment. The results show for the first time that benzodiazepines may elicit paradoxical behavioural response in autistic children. The possible involvement of an altered function at the level of GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex is discussed.", 
    "54": "Two strains of inbred mice differed significantly in their susceptibility to tonic seizures induced by caffeine and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). The hyporesponsive strain, SWR, was not less susceptible to the convulsant action of other chemical convulsants, an observation which indicated that the response differences between the strains were pharmacologically specific. These observations and drug interaction studies suggested that caffeine-induced seizures might be mediated through an \"inverse\" agonist-like action of caffeine on benzodiazepine receptors associated with GABA receptor-benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex. To determine whether the coincident alteration in susceptibility to DMCM and caffeine resulted from a single mutational change or was the result of two different genetic changes occurring coincidentally between these two strains of mice, progeny from conventional Mendelian crosses (F1, F2 and reciprocal backcrosses) were analyzed for the co-segregation of susceptibility to DMCM and caffeine. The inheritance of DMCM sensitivity was consistent with a single autosomal gene determinant in which the allele specifying increased responsiveness was dominant to the allele determining hyporesponsiveness. The frequent occurrence of recombinant phenotypes (e.g., caffeine hyporesponsive but DMCM sensitive mice) among F2 and backcross progeny established that different genetic determinants encode DMCM susceptibility and caffeine susceptibility in these two strains of mice. Thus, while these data establish a simply inherited difference in benzodiazepine responsiveness between the two mouse strains, they also indicate that this pair of strains is inappropriate for a genetic analysis aimed at probing the relationship between caffeine-induced seizures and the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "55": "The nonopioid antitussives dextromethorphan (DM), carbetapentane and caramiphen are efficacious anticonvulsant agents in the rat MES test. The findings presented strongly suggest the existence of a novel allosteric mechanism by which drugs acting at two different but interacting sites, exert their effects. This mechanism has marked similarities with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine interactions, even though their binding sites are different. The allosteric interactions of dextromethorphan and phenytoin in the binding assay and the potentiation of the anticonvulsant effects of phenytoin by dextromethorphan suggest that drugs that bind to the dextromethorphan sites could be used to reduce the effective dose of phenytoin and reduce its side effects, at least those which are not an extension of its specific pharmacological actions. It is evident that the investigation of the molecular mechanisms described may help to open new approaches to understand and treat convulsive disorders, to find novel anticonvulsant drugs and to further explain some of the molecular mechanisms of neuronal excitability.", 
    "56": "The benzodiazepines were introduced into clinical practice in 1960 and since that time have become one of the most frequently prescribed of all psychotropic agents. Over the past 25 years the mechanism by which these compounds produce their effects has been revealed by a combination of electrophysiological and biochemical studies. It is now apparent that these drugs interact with a specific recognition site on the GABAA receptor complex and thereby modulate the gating of the chloride channel associated with this major inhibitory amino acid transmitter receptor. This modulation is novel in that while the clinically prescribed benzodiazepines increase the chloride current in response to a given GABA stimulus, agents are now known which produce the opposite effect. However, the details of the molecular mechanisms by which these events occur remain to be elucidated. Our progress toward this goal will rely on the acquisition of structural information about this receptor protein using the techniques of molecular biology and its marriage with new initiatives concerning the detail of ligand recognition. The interpretation of such information in the context of the complex pharmacology of this important receptor system is indeed a stimulating prospect.", 
    "57": "Quantitative aspects of the potentiation of GABA and muscimol by benzodiazepines and barbiturates are reviewed, taking account of both electrophysiological and receptor binding data. It has been a consistent finding that barbiturates cause a greater maximal potentiation than do benzodiazepines. The steroid anaesthetic alphaxalone and some naturally occurring steroids were compared as potentiators of electrophysiological responses to muscimol. From the relative potencies, important structural features of the steroid molecule for this effect have been identified. The possibility of the barbiturates and the steroids having a common mode of action as potentiators of GABA and muscimol is discussed, together with the idea that this action may involve perturbation of membrane lipids rather than a barbiturate/steroid receptor site. The GABA-potentiating effect of ethanol may also be barbiturate-like but potentiations by chlormethiazole and ketamine appear to involve different mechanisms. It is predicted that any endogenous potentiators of GABA would be unlikely to have more than a modest effect.", 
    "58": "This article reviews animal tests of anxiety and charts the contribution of behavioural studies to the neuropharmacology of anxiety. In particular it has been possible to distinguish several sites of action for anxiogenic drugs. Whilst great progress has been made to knowledge of the functioning of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, there has been little advance in the understanding of the other neurochemical pathways concerned with mediating changes in anxiety. The claim to have a drug that is a non-sedative anxiolytic should be based on firm behavioural evidence. The extent to which this has been realised for the existing candidates is reviewed.", 
    "59": "In order to evaluate the regulation of neuropeptide stores in structures of the rat brain, the content of the specific messenger ribonucleic acid for the peptide precursor, of the precursor and of its biologically active peptide fragment, resulting from the precursor processing was measured. Enkephalin stores of the striatum, but not that of other structures, were upregulated by repeated daily doses of dopaminergic receptor antagonists of the D-1 type. Morphine tolerance failed to change stores of enkephalin in brain but produced a down-regulation of the synthesis of pro-opiomelanocortin in the hypothalamus. The regulation of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), the precursor of a family of putative endogenous ligands of the benzodiazepine recognition site, was studied during tolerance to benzodiazepines. Tolerance to diazepam increased the dynamic state of an octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), derived from DBI, in the cerebellum and cortex. The steady state or dynamic state of ODN were not changed in other structures of the brain of the rat, tolerant to diazepam.", 
    "60": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) belongs to a family of newly discovered neuropeptides that, when acting on the benzodiazepine/beta-carboline recognition site, provide an allosteric modulation of the function of GABAA receptor. The molecular size of DBI (10K Da) and its amino acid sequence characteristics are compatible with the view that this polypeptide can function as a precursor of smaller biologically active neuropeptides. In neurons of the cerebral cortex of the neonatal rat, in primary culture, DBI coexists with at least 4 different processing products. These peptides immunoreact with an antiserum directed against a biologically active octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) amino acid sequence of which (QATVGDVNTDRPGLLDLK) is included in the middle portion of the amino acid sequence of DBI. One of the immunoreactive peptides extracted from neurons has a retention time in high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) identical to that of synthetic ODN. Double immunofluorescence staining of the cultured neurons with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and antibodies for ODN indicates that ODN and ODN-like peptides are localized with GABA in 58% of the GAD-positive neurons. Moreover, the proportion of the neuronal stores of GABA, ODN, DBI-like peptides and DBI that are released together following depolarization with veratridine is similar. These experiments provide evidence to suggest that ODN, ODN-like peptides derived from DBI, might participate as putative neuromodulators of physiological significance in changing the probability that a quantum of GABA opens specific chloride (Cl-) channels located on post-synaptic cell membranes.", 
    "61": "Using an in-vitro superfusion system, the relative importance of three distinct subtypes of the opiate receptor in the control of the secretion of LHRH from the mediobasal hypothalamus of the cockerel was investigated. Basal release of LHRH was increased by the antagonist naloxone, which shows some mu-receptor selectivity, in a manner which was reversed by the mu-receptor specific agonist [D-Ala2, N-Phe4-Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAGO) and the mu- and delta-specific agonist [D-Ala2,N-Phe4,Met(0)ol5]-enkephalin (FK 33-824). The delta-specific agonist [D-Thr2,L-Leu5]-enkephalyl-Thr (DTLET) and the kappa-specific agonist 1-methyl-2(3-thienylcarbonyl)-aminomethyl-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-H-2, 3-dihydro-1,4-benzodiazepine (KC 6128; (+)-titfluadom) did not reverse the effect of naloxone. The delta-specific antagonist N,N-diallyl-Tyr-alpha-aminoisobutyricacid-Phe-Leu-OH (ICI 174,864) failed to influence basal release. Release of LHRH stimulated by increasing the potassium ion concentration of the superfusate to 48 mmol/l was reduced by DAGO in a manner which was reversed by naloxone, and by FK 33-824 in a manner which was reversed by both naloxone and ICI 174,864. The agonists DTLET and titfluadom did not affect stimulated release of LHRH. These results support the proposal that spontaneous release of LHRH is tonically inhibited by agonists acting through the mu-receptor whilst, in response to a stimulus, the delta-receptor, in addition to the mu-receptor, may be involved.", 
    "62": "The effects of chemically and electrically-induced convulsions on the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) was studied in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system (CNS). Acute, maximal electroshock (MES) increased the density of PBR in mouse cerebral cortex as evidenced by a 30% increase in the Bmax of this archetypic ligand. These values returned to control levels by 60 minutes after MES treatment. In contrast, thirty and sixty minutes after convulsions induced by Ro 5-4864, strychnine, or pentylenetetrazol, neither the Bmax nor Kd of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to mouse cerebral cortical membranes was altered. The increase in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to cortex observed 30 minutes after MES was blocked by anticonvulsant doses of phenobarbital, phenytoin and clonazepam. No changes in the characteristics of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding was observed in cerebellar or hippocampal membranes 30 minutes following acute MES. Further, after long-term MES administration (1 treatment/day, 5 days), no change in PBR density could be detected 30 minutes after the last MES. Finally, while no change in PBR density was noted in the kidneys 30 minutes after the MES, a significant increase in PBR density was seen in the cardiac ventricles. These results demonstrate a selective modulation of PBR density by MES, suggesting that the PBR could be involved in either the generation of seizures or in postictal compensatory processes.", 
    "63": "The experimental accessibility of monolayer culture has been used to study signal transduction mechanisms in primary CNS neurons and clonal pituitary cells. Here we review results on two signals representative of the emerging diversity of mechanisms discovered in all species studied thus far. One is mediated by micromolar concentrations of the amino acid GABA at postsynaptic membranes throughout the mammalian CNS and involves transient activation of Cl- ion channels whose distribution of conducting periods accounts for the millisecond time course of the signal. This signal serves to depress the probability that the target cell will trigger an action potential. The signal intensifies as the postsynaptic membrane is depolarized and can be modulated by clinically important drugs, primarily through changes in channel kinetics. The other signal involves nanomolar concentrations of the peptide TRH, which stimulates secretion of prolactin from clonal \"GH3\" pituitary cells. Intracellular recordings of GH3B6 cells show that TRH triggers a complex electrical response lasting several minutes. The response consists of Ca2+-activated K+ conductance followed by Ca2+-action potential activity. Whole-cell patch recordings, which rapidly dialyze the cell, can eliminate the TRH-induced changes in membrane excitability. Inclusion of aqueous lysates of the GH3B6 clone or the soluble second messenger factors inositol trisphosphate (IP3) or protein kinase (PKC) can restore various aspects of the change in membrane excitability. Thus, TRH alters ion conductance mechanisms through a second messenger cascade likely to involve IP3-mediated mobilization of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and transient translocation of PKC from cytoplasm to plasma membrane. These synaptic and extrasynaptic signals reflect some of the diversity of transduction mechanisms involved in intercellular communication.", 
    "64": "The Xenopus oocyte is the only system currently available for the full expression of mRNAS encoding membrane receptors and ion channels. Its application in the case of brain mRNAs for the GABAA receptor is illustrated, including the production of receptor subunits and its chloride channel with characteristic pharmacology.", 
    "65": "Benzodiazepine receptor ligands are known to modulate the binding of [35S]TBPS to the chloride channel via an allosteric action. In the cases of diazepam, zopiclone and CGS 9895, the enhanced binding of [35S]TBPS induced by these benzodiazepine agonists was antagonized by CGS 8216. This antagonism was characterized both by a shift to the right and a decrease in the maximal stimulation, for the dose-response curves of diazepam and zopiclone. In the case of CGS 9895, the maximal response was not decreased. These data indicate that CGS 8216 is a noncompetitive antagonist of classical benzodiazepine receptor agonists but is a competitive inhibitor of the partial agonist, CGS 9895.", 
    "66": "The effect of chronic administration of haloperidol on alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptors, cholinergic muscarinic, GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex of the rat was investigated. Doses of 0.3 and 2 mg/kg of haloperidol during 7 days increased markedly the density of alpha 1-adrenoceptors without changes in affinity. The alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors were not modified after neuroleptic administration. The number of muscarinic receptors were also increased after haloperidol treatment (2 mg/kg/day). However, the GABAA and benzodiazepine binding sites remained unchanged. In the brainstem an increment in the alpha 1-, but not the beta-adrenoceptors was observed. The well known increase in the dopamine receptors in the striatum was confirmed. These observations demonstrate a multireceptor effect of haloperidol in the cerebral cortex.", 
    "67": "Defeat stress in mice, a model of social stress, increases benzodiazepine receptor binding as measured by specific [3H]Ro15-1788 binding in vivo, but not by [3H]flunitrazepam binding in vitro. This increase occurs rapidly, by 20 min following exposure to stress, and resolves by 60 min. Increased benzodiazepine receptor binding is observed in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hypothalamus, and appears to be due to an increase in receptor number rather than apparent affinity. The stress-induced increase in central benzodiazepine receptors is decreased in a dose-dependent fashion by lorazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist, but not by the receptor antagonist Ro15-1788. The stress-induced increase in benzodiazepine receptors is also blocked by adrenalectomy and is restored by corticosterone replacement.", 
    "68": "Using noxious heat-evoked tail flick in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital infusion, we studied the effects of diazepam applied intrathecally. This drug caused a marked suppression of nociceptive reflexes in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, a small non-suppressive dose of diazepam potentiated electroacupuncture effects. These results are discussed in terms of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) since it is known that diazepam enhances binding of GABA to its receptor and hence potentiates inhibitory effects of GABA in the spinal cord. The possible synergism of diazepam and pentobarbital is also discussed.", 
    "69": "A considerable body of biochemical and neurophysiological evidence implicates GABA in anxiety and in benzodiazepine action. The present article surveys the behavioral effects of GABA agonists and their interactions with drugs acting at the benzodiazepine receptor in animal anxiety paradigms. Certain GABA agonists, notably valproate, simulate many behavioral actions of benzodiazepines. Moreover, several behavioral studies of the interaction of GABA agonists with benzodiazepines support the hypothesis of a benzodiazepine receptor complex with one or more GABA, benzodiazepine and probably other binding sites. However, there are also a number of anomalous findings of GABA agonist action alone and in combination with benzodiazepines. It is argued that these paradoxical results can better be accounted for in terms of the receptor complex and the distribution of the drugs, rather than by suggesting that the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines are not mediated by GABA systems. The potential clinical usefulness of GABA agonists in anxiety is commented upon.", 
    "70": "Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (n = 18) entered a 21-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled random assignment trial of clorazepate. Positron emission tomography with 18F-deoxyglucose was carried out before and after treatment. Decreases in glucose metabolic rate in visual cortex and relative increases in the basal ganglia and thalamus were found. A correlation between regional changes in metabolic rate and regional benzodiazepine receptor binding density from other human autopsy studies was observed; brain regions highest in receptor density showed the greatest decrease in rate.", 
    "71": "The gastric anti-secretagogue effects of cimetidine (a histamine H2-receptor antagonist) and of atropine (a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist) and pirenzepine (a selective muscarinic M1-receptor antagonist) were examined in conscious gastric fistula rats both under basal conditions and after stimulation with maximal doses of pentagastrin and histamine. Cimetidine blocked basal as well as stimulated acid secretion. The cimetidine dose-response curves and the calculated ED50 values were similar in the different experimental situations. Atropine blocked equally effectively the basal and the stimulated acid secretion. The antisecretagogue and pupil dilating effects were compared. The ED50 values for the anti-secretagogue effect and for the pupil dilating effect were in the same range though not identical. Pirenzepine blocked acid secretion, whether basal or stimulated, with similar potency. It was much more potent to block acid secretion than to cause pupil dilatation. The greater potency of pirenzepine to block acid secretion than to cause pupil dilatation suggests that the cholinergic pathway of acid secretion involves neuronal muscarinic M1-receptors within the intramural ganglia of the stomach wall. In conclusion, cimetidine, atropine and pirenzepine effectively blocked basal as well as pentagastrin- and histamine-stimulated acid secretion, indicating that both histamine and acetylcholine are important in the control of the parietal cell. Histamine has been claimed to be the final common chemical mediator of acid secretion. This view is at odds with the fact that muscarinic blocking agents also inhibit basal and stimulated acid secretion.", 
    "72": "Reduced (24%) [3H]PK 11195 binding capacity to platelet membranes was observed in anxious patients in comparison to age- and sex-matched normal controls. Four weeks of diazepam treatment induced elevation (69%) in the maximal number of binding sites, and 1 week of drug withdrawal resulted in a slight decrease (16%) in 'peripheral' benzodiazepine binding sites as compared to their level during treatment.", 
    "73": "The convulsant actions of methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) and of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) were evaluated in the baboon (Papio papio). DMCM, 0.6-4 mg/kg, induced epileptic seizures with short latency. DMCM convulsive seizures could be blocked by i.v. administration of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam (10 mg). Similarly, beta-CCM, 0.3-3 mg/kg i.v., provoked generalized seizures in the baboons. These seizures were also reversed by the administration of propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (3 mg/kg) or of diazepam (5 mg/kg). Combining the results from Positron Emission Tomography and the EEG assessments, benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by beta-CCM and DMCM was directly correlated with their convulsant actions in the living baboon. beta-CCM exerted its convulsant action in the living baboon at 76 and 74% benzodiazepine receptor occupancy in, respectively, occipital and temporal cortices whereas DMCM displayed a similar convulsive activity when only 58 and 65% of these receptors in the above regions were occupied."
