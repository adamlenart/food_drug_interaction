    "0": "The effects of 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid were investigated on performance in an elevated plus-maze. This compound is a high-affinity, partial agonist ligand at strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex. Like chlordiazepoxide, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid increased in a dose-dependent manner both the percent entries into and the percent time spent in the open arms of the plus-maze. However, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid was significantly less efficacious than chlordiazepoxide in these measures and increased, while chlordiazepoxide decreased, the time spent in the middle platform of the plus-maze. These findings indicate that ligands acting through strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex may represent a new class of anxiolytic agents with a profile which differs from the benzodiazepines.", 
    "1": "Clobazam, a 1-5 benzodiazepine with anxiolytic properties, was evaluated in the treatment of patients with DSM-III panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks. In this open clinical trial, 10 of the 15 patients completed 8 weeks of treatment. Six of the 10 completers (60%) were responders (75% reduction in the number of panic attacks from baseline) at the end of 8 weeks. Of the responders so defined, 5 of the 6 were panic free. At the end of week 8 the average dose for the responders to medication was 50 +/- 17 (S.D.) mg per day. Clobazam was well tolerated at the doses used with the few side-effects recorded as mild to moderate. The study suggests that further placebo-controlled studies are warranted to evaluate clobazam's potential antipanic effect.", 
    "2": "Fourteen patients received oral premedication of temazepam in soft gelatin capsules before minor surgery. The plasma concentrations of temazepam and its sedative, anxiolytic and amnesic effects were measured for 24 hours. Absorption was rapid and peak concentrations occurred 49 minutes after administration. Clinical effects were evident at 30 minutes and persisted for about 4 hours. The decline in plasma concentration was biexponential with a distribution half-life of 1.24 hours. The end of the distribution phase coincided approximately with the termination of its clinical effects. A relationship between plasma concentration and effect was observed; concentrations above 300 ng/ml produced measurable changes in tests of mental function. Patients had recovered fully from the effects of temazepam after 24 hours. This dose of temazepam is reliable and effective as premedication before surgery.",

How this goal is approached stepwise is shown in the case of the benzodiazepine group of active substances.", 
    "4": "1. The effects of lorazepam discontinuation on responses to benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists were studied in mice. 2. The convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazol was decreased after an acute dose of lorazepam (0.5 mg kg-1) at 4 days after drug discontinuation, compared to 1 or 7 days after discontinuation or to vehicle treatment. 3. The percentage of mice undergoing convulsions after an acute dose of FG 7142 (40 mg kg-1) was increased at 4 days after lorazepam discontinuation, compared to 1 or 7 days after discontinuation or to vehicle treatment. 4. After an acute dose (0.5 mg kg-1), lorazepam concentrations in cortex tended to be greater in lorazepam-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice at 4 days after discontinuation compared to 1 and 7 days. 5. These data indicate a shift toward reduced agonist sensitivity and increased inverse agonist sensitivity in mice 4 days after lorazepam discontinuation.", 
    "5": "The amplitude of the P300 component of auditory evoked responses was found to be depressed by benzodiazepine sedation and was subsequently used to monitor the recovery of volunteers sedated with midazolam. The amplitude of the evoked responses was found to be highly correlated with blood midazolam levels but to be no more sensitive than standard psychomotor testing in assessing recovery from sedation.", 
    "6": "Patients with duodenal ulcer (DU) were classified into responders to H2-antagonist and non-responders in whom DU did not heal within 3 months with the antagonist. In these patients and healthy controls, a modified sham-feeding (MSF) test was performed to elucidate the pathogenesis of resistance to H2-antagonist. By MSF stimulation, gastric acid secretion significantly increased in all subjects. The mean acid output by MSF amounted to about 52 of the tetra-gastrin maximum in controls (12 cases), 46% in responders (12 cases) and 72% in non-responders (14 cases). The mean acid output in non-responders was significantly higher than in controls under baseline conditions, MSF and gastrin stimulations, but was higher than in responders during MSF stimulation. The effects of H2-antagonist (cimetidine 1mg/kg/h), anti-muscarinic agent (pirenzepine 0.3mg/kg/h), or both on the acid secretion were examined on non-responders (6 cases), responders (6 cases) and healthy controls (6 cases). The acid secretion stimulated by MSF was significantly inhibited by pirenzepine in responders and controls, but not in non-responders. With cimetidine, the acid output was significantly inhibited in all groups, but was still higher in non-responders than in controls and responders, indicating that the reduction of acid output by a H2-antagonist is significantly less in non-responders than in other groups. The combined use of pirenzepine and cimetidine almost completely inhibited the acid output in all groups. These data suggest that the vagal activity in non-responders to H2-antagonist is higher than in responders and healthy subjects, and H2-antagonist combined with anti-muscarinic agent is more effective in reducing the gastric acid secretion in non-responders.", 
    "7": "The aim of this study was to examine in detail the effects of selective cholinergic and other pharmacological antagonists on primary and secondary peristalsis in the smooth muscle of the cat esophagus in order to fully characterize the cholinergic contribution to peristalsis in this species. Primary and secondary peristalsis in the smooth muscle part of the feline esophagus was completely abolished by atropine, 4-dephenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) (a selective M2 muscarinic antagonist), hexamethonium, and high doses of nicotine. Pirenzepine (a selective M1 muscarinic antagonist), propranolol, and phentolamine were without effect, as were naloxone, methysergide, and pyrilamine. From these findings we conclude that primary and secondary peristalsis in feline esophageal smooth muscle involves nicotinic ganglionic neurotransmission as well as postganglionic release of acetylcholine that acts directly on muscarinic receptors located on the smooth muscle. Peristalsis in esophageal striated muscle does not involve either synaptic transmission or muscarinic receptors.", 
    "8": "The synthesis of [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b][1,5]-, imidazolo[4,5-b][1,5]-, and pyrido[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepines is described. The antidopaminergic and anticholinergic activities of the compounds have been examined by the respective in vitro [3H]spiperone and [3H]QNB receptor binding assay. The neuroleptic potential has been further evaluated in terms of their ability to produce hypothermia and catalepsy in mice and a conditioned avoidance response in rats. Only compounds from the triazolobenzodiazepine series show antipsychotic potential. The lack of activity in the imidazolo- and pyridobenzodiazepine series indicates that the basicity of the heteroarene moiety may be determinant for activity.", 
    "9": "Approximately 30 percent of patients undergoing anorectal surgery will develop acute urinary retention. The cause of this complication is poorly understood. Anxiety, anal distention, bladder distention as a result of vigorous hydration during surgery, and reflex inhibition of the urinary bladder detrusor muscle secondary to pain have been postulated as contributing factors. A four-armed prospective, double-blind, randomized trial was carried out to determine whether an anxiolytic agent (midazolam, 5 mg intramuscularly) and/or a parasympathomimetic agent (bethanechol, 10 mg subcutaneously) reduce the incidence of postoperative urinary retention following anorectal surgery. One hundred thirty-two patients (ages, 18 to 50 years), in acute urinary retention 6 to 12 hours following anorectal surgery, were enrolled. Sixty-nine percent of patients responded to bethanechol. Side effects were minimal. Midazolam alone had no effect on retention. Bethanechol and midazolam in combination resulted in less retention than midazolam and a placebo (P less than 0.05). Bethanechol alone was better than a placebo (P less than 0.002). Mean intraoperative intravenous fluid volume for the entire study group was 900 cc. Initial postoperative urinary volumes of patients who failed the treatment protocol were significantly higher than in those responding to bethanechol (mean of 527 cc vs. 241 cc, P less than 0.001). The use of an anxiolytic agent was not effective in the treatment of postoperative urinary retention. Bladder distention may increase the incidence of urinary retention. Bethanechol, in a dose of 10 mg subcutaneously, significantly lowered the incidence of postoperative urinary catheterization and should be considered as initial treatment of postoperative urinary retention following anorectal surgery.",

    "11": "Midazolam (MDZ) (8-chloro-6(2-fluoropheny 1)-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-[1,5a] [1,4]benzodiazepine) is an \"annelated\" benzodiazepine (BZDs) synthetized in 1976, characterized differently with the \"classical\" BZDs by a five-membered heterocycle fused on position 1,2 of the diazepine nucleus. This fused imidazol ring modifies the properties inherent in the \"classical\" BZDs in at the least three aspects: solubility, metabolisation and the stability in aqueous solution. MDZ, having similar properties with the \"classical\" benzodiazepines, has better local tolerance, faster onset of action, greater plasmatic clearance, shorter half-life elimination (1.7-2.4 hr) with no active metabolites. With a bioavailability of 92% (IV), 82-91% (IM) and 50-52% \"per os\", the CNS effects of MDZ are similar in all three ways. In anesthesiology we can administer MDZ as an anesthetic premedication (\"per os\", IM or IV), anesthetic induction and maintenance and IV sedation in locorregional anesthetic procedures or diagnostic and therapeutic explorations. MDZ has a great safety margin, moderate respiratory and cardiovascular effects and lacks of teratogenic or embryotoxic effects.", 
    "12": "Seventy one long-term users of benzodiazepines were asked by their general practitioners in a letter or short interview to reduce their medication. Twenty two patients were successful in giving up or reducing their consumption to less than 100 tablets per annum. There were no clear predictors of success in terms of patient characteristics, duration of drug use, type of benzodiazepine, reason for drug use or strategy employed to reduce medication. However, patients who were successful at reducing their medication had a significantly lower mean baseline drug consumption than unsuccessful patients. The implications of this study are that a proportion of long-term users who are not in current crisis, especially those with relatively low consumption, can reduce or stop benzodiazepine treatment with minimal difficulty.",

    "14": "Binding studies suggest the presence of at least two pharmacologically distinct 'central' benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. Since central benzodiazepine receptors are allosteric modulatory sites on GABAA receptors, this evidence indirectly points to the existence of at least two GABAA receptors. Werner Sieghart describes biochemical studies that have identified several different alpha- and beta-subunits of these receptors, and molecular biological studies in which the genes encoding a variety of different alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunits have been isolated, sequenced and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These studies all point to the existence of multiple GABAA receptors in the brain.", 
    "15": "1. The relative spinal effectiveness of mu- and kappa-opioids has been assessed by their intravenous potencies on nociceptive responses (heat and/or pinch) of single motoneurones recorded in alpha-chloralose anaesthetized, spinalized rats. 2. The depressant actions of both mu- and kappa-opioids were reversed by low intravenous doses of naloxone (10 to 100 micrograms kg-1). When tested at a dose of 1 microgram kg-1 i.v., naloxone antagonized the effects of the mu-agonist morphine but had no effect on the kappa-opioid U-50,488. This provides further support for the theory that the actions of mu- and kappa-ligands were mediated at different subclasses of opioid receptor but highlights the difficulties in using antagonists with poor receptor selectivity to differentiate between mu- and kappa-receptor-mediated effects in vivo. 3. The molar potency rations of fentanyl: morphine:U-50,488: tifluadom for thermal and mechanical nociceptive responses were 620: 1.0:0.74:5.7 and 520:1.0:0.56:7.7 respectively. These potency ratios, as well as the absolute potencies, agree well with those reported in several behavioural studies in which systemic administration of agonists was used in non-thermal tests. 4. The agonist potency values obtained in this study contrast with those reported for local spinal administration. By this route, the potency of lipophilic opioids (e.g. fentanyl, U-50,488 and tifluadom) relative to hydrophilic opioids (e.g. morphine) is much reduced, implying that activity of intrathecally administered opioids is more dependent on the physico-chemical properties of the agonists used than on the relative abundance in the spinal cord of functional opioid receptors of the mu- and kappa-subtypes. This conclusion indicates that the results with locally applied opioids should not be used to assess spinal opioid receptor function.", 
    "16": "1. In electrophysiological experiments in spinalized rats, mu- and kappa-opioids were tested intravenously on the responses of single motoneurones to electronically controlled, alternating noxious heat and noxious pinch stimuli. The effects of mu- and kappa-opioids were compared with those of the general anaesthetic alpha-chloralose and the dissociative anaesthetic/PCP ligand ketamine. 2. The kappa-opioids U-50,488 (0.5-16 mgkg-1 i.v.) and tifluadom (0.05-1.6 mgkg-1 i.v.) had very similar actions to the mu-opioid fentanyl (0.5-16 micrograms kg-1 i.v.). Thus all three agonists reduced thermal and mechanical nociceptive reflexes in parallel and in a dose-dependent manner, but only so long as neuronal responses to the alternating stimuli elicited similar excitability levels in the neurone under study. Ketamine (0.5-16 mgkg-1 i.v.) had similar actions to the opioids whereas alpha-chloralose (20 mgkg-1 i.v.) had very little effect on neuronal responsiveness. 3. Apparently 'selective' depressions by both mu- and kappa-opioids could be orchestrated by a deliberate mismatch of the intensities of alternating noxious heat and pinch stimuli; as measured by neuronal firing rate, the weaker of the responses to either type of stimulus was invariably reduced to a greater degree. 4. Similar 'selectivity' could be demonstrated for both mu- and kappa-ligands when the weaker and stronger responses were of the same modality, being applied by the same pincher device but with alternating applied force. 5. It is concluded that the 'selective' spinal actions of kappa-opioids seen in non-thermal over thermal behavioural models of nociception is likely to be related to the relative intensities, rather than the modalities, of the noxious stimuli used. The validity of the interpretation of results obtained in such behavioural studies is discussed.", 
    "17": "Benzodiazepines can regulate neoplastic growth and immune response through specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. We investigated the presence of peripheral and classic central benzodiazepine receptors as well as diazepam-binding inhibitor, an endogenous ligand of both types of receptors, in different human cerebral tumors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors were present in all the tumor types studied, whereas central benzodiazepine receptors and diazepam-binding inhibitor were detectable in astrocytomas and glioblastomas and undetectable in meningiomas, neurinomas, and metastases. The role of diazepam-binding inhibitor and of the different benzodiazepine receptors in neoplastic cells is still to be defined.", 
    "18": "99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT and SPECT with the 123I-labelled benzodiazepine (Bz) receptor ligand Ro 16-0154 were performed in 10 patients suffering from partial epilepsy, without cerebral lesion in MRT or CT.2 h p.i. of Ro 16-0154 the distribution of activity correlated with the known distribution of Bz-receptors in the human brain. Perfusion and receptor-binding were found decreased in 7 patients of each study in the suspicious brain-area. 123I-labelled Ro 16-0154 is suitable for Bz-receptor mapping by SPECT. The decrease of Bz-receptor binding in epileptic foci, as described in PET-studies, was also detected by SPECT in 7 of 10 patients.", 
    "19": "In vivo convulsant activities profiles and receptor binding studies together with the techniques of theoretical chemistry were used to characterize 15 compounds, from five different chemical families, known to bind to the BDZ receptor. The experimental goals of this study were to determine the affinity of these analogs for this receptor, the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid on the affinity, and, in a self-consistent manner, the nature of the activity, agonist (anticonvulsant), antagonist, or inverse agonist (proconvulsant, convulsant), elicited by binding to this receptor. To these ends, in vivo studies were made to determine the proconvulsant, convulsant, and anticonvulsant activities and antagonism to anticonvulsant activities of the 15 analogs. Their receptor affinities at 25 degrees were also determined by competitive inhibition of [3H] flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro 15-1788 in the absence and presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid. The goal of the theoretical studies was to identify and calculate molecular properties that modulate these affinities and types of activities and from them to develop a model of receptor recognition and activation that could consistently explain observed behavior and predict new results. Thus, molecular orbital calculations were carried out for all analogs, using semiempirical quantum mechanical methods. In addition to the optimization of structures, a number of electronic properties, such as polarizations, partition coefficients, and proton and electron affinities were computed and examined for their ability to modulate relative affinities and modes of activation of the receptor. From these studies, a model for receptor recognition involving two anchoring hydrogen bond-acceptor sites and for activation involving interaction of the most lipophilic aromatic region of each compound with the receptor was developed, which could systematically account for the three different types of behavior, agonist, antagonist, and inverse agonist, observed for these analogs. Electronic rather than structural properties were found to be the principal modulator of both recognition and activation. A possible mechanism of agonist activation of the receptor involving electron transfer to the agonist, as well as a possible induced conformational change in the receptor, is also suggested by these results. Finally, by complementarity, some steric and electronic characteristics of the receptor binding site could be deduced.", 
    "20": "The synthesis and biochemical evaluation of a series of oxadiazole derivatives of imidazobenzodiazepines related to the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (2a) are reported. Although the oxadiazole ring is seen as an isosteric replacement for the ester linkage, significant differences in structure-activity trends were observed. Specifically, oxadiazoles 9-12 invariably had increased receptor efficacy (as witnessed by measurements of the GABA shift) relative to the corresponding ester. Additionally, and in direct contrast to the classical agonists such as diazepam, affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor was enhanced by a 7- rather than 8-halo substituent. The results are discussed in terms of a six-point receptor-binding model originally based on the X-ray structure of 2a. For comparison, the crystal structures of two representative oxadiazole derivatives, 10h and 12o, having a 6-oxo and 6-phenyl group, respectively, were determined and the data incorporated into a modified binding model to account for the greater efficacy of these compounds. It is concluded that the antagonist behavior of 2a relies upon the hydrogen-bond-acceptor properties of the ester carbonyl oxygen whereas for the oxadiazole series this site is localized at the imidazole nitrogen.", 
    "21": "To evaluate the relationship between the pharmacological effect of benzodiazepine (BZP) and BZP receptor (BZP-R) binding in the conscious mouse brain, a response of the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization (GU) to clonazepam (CNZ) was measured as an index for the pharmacological effect. Two glucose analogs (3-O-[3H]methylglucose and 2-[14C]deoxyglucose) method, originally presented by A. Gjedde was used for determination of GU. In the cerebral cortex, GU decreased to 70 to 80% at 60 min after i.v. administration of CNZ (0.005-1.0 mg/kg), but CNZ did not change the lumped constant, and this effect was diminished completely by the administration of a BZP antagonist, Ro-15-1788 (5 mg/kg). The maximum effect of CNZ on GU (about 30% decrease) was found at 0.1 mg/kg of CNZ, but increasing the dose to 1 mg/kg had very little additional effect. In vivo BZP-R occupancy was measured using [3H]-Ro-15-1788. Receptor occupancy increased from less than 10% at a dose of 0.005 mg/kg up to essentially 100% at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater. ID50 in dose-response curve of the receptor occupancy for CNZ and ED50 in that of decrease in GU were 0.3 and 0.007 mg/kg, respectively . A nonlinear and hyperbolic relationship was observed between the receptor occupancy and the response for the glucose metabolic rate, indicating that BZP exert the maximum glucose metabolic change at a low fractional receptor occupancy (30-40%).", 
    "22": "The effect of chronic ethanol treatment, and its withdrawal on the binding of ligands to the benzodiazepine binding sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex, was investigated in C57BL/6J mice spinal cord cultured neurons. Chronic ethanol (50 mM) treatment increased the specific binding of inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine binding sites, without affecting the binding of agonist or antagonist to this site. Thus, chronic ethanol exposure of the neurons increased the binding of [3H] Ro 15-4513 [ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5-alpha][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate] and methyl-1-beta carboline-3-carboxylate [( 3H]beta-CCM), but not the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]Ro 15-1788 [ethyl-8-fluro-5-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-OxO-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha][1, 4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate]. This increase was due to an increase in the number of binding sites for Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM, and not due to a change in receptor affinity. The increase was observed as early as after a 12-hr exposure of the neurons with ethanol, and remained elevated at 24-hr withdrawal, returning to control values at 48-hr withdrawal. These results further strengthen the notion that Ro 15-4513 and related inverse agonists binding site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex may be involved in ethanol-s behavioral, biochemical and pharmacological effects which are mediated via GABAA receptor system. The significance of the enhanced binding sites for Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM in the actions of ethanol, tolerance and withdrawal is discussed.", 
    "23": "The involvement of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy was examined in thioacetamide-treated rats with fulminant hepatic failure. Partially purified extracts from encephalopathic rat brain were approximately three times more potent in inhibiting [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding to benzodiazepine receptors than identically prepared extracts from control rats. High levels of inhibitory activity were also found in extracts of plasma, heart, and liver from thioacetamide-treated rats. The inhibition of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding by brain extracts appeared to be competitive and reversible and was unaffected by treatment with either proteolytic enzymes or boiling. Further, GABA significantly enhanced the potency of these extracts in inhibiting [3H]flunitrazepam binding. In contrast, no differences were found in radioligand binding to the constituent recognition sites of the GABAA receptor complex in well-washed brain membranes prepared from control and encephalopathic animals. These findings suggest that the recognition-site qualities of the constituent proteins of the GABAA receptor complex are unchanged in an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy. However, significant elevations in the level of a substance or substances with neurochemical properties characteristic of a benzodiazepine receptor agonist may contribute to the electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "24": "The pharmacology of anticonvulsant drugs is reviewed with emphasis placed on the treatment of canine and feline epilepsy. Due to pharmacokinetic reasons, only phenobarbital, primidone, and, with certain limitations, the benzodiazepines can be used in dogs. Bromides may be given additionally in cases that cannot be controlled with phenobarbital or promidone therapy. In cats, diazepam has been shown to be very useful because no tolerance develops to the antiepileptic effect in this species.", 
    "25": "The pre-operative circulatory and psychotomimetic side-effects are studied in one hundred patients undergoing elective plastic-reconstructive surgery and anesthetized by ketamine 5-8 mg/kg i.m. Fifty patients were premedicated by atropine 0.01 mg/kg + CDDz 0.0285 mg/kg i.m. (group C), fifty by atropine 0.01 mg/kg + Dz 0.14 mg/kg i.m. (group D). All patients breathed spontaneously. Statistical analysis was performed with X 2 test. Not statistical difference was observed for the circulatory side-effects, whereas the frequency of emergence phenomena fell significantly from 31% to 14% (p less than 0.05) with CDDZ in greater than 16 years old patients. These finding seem confirm that CDDZ is more effective than DZ in reducing the psychotomimetic side-effects of ketamine, though it may be recommended a its wider experiment in this connection.", 
    "26": "The effect of GABAergic drugs on the motor-impairing effects of ethanol, barbital, and lorazepam were studied in the ethanol-sensitive ANT (Alcohol Nontolerant) and ethanol-insensitive AT (Alcohol Tolerant) rat lines, selected for differential ethanol-induced motor impairment on the tilting plane. The basic population from which these rat lines were derived, the mixed (M) line, was also included in the study. The ANT rats were more sensitive to the intoxicating effects of ethanol, barbital, and lorazepam than the AT and M rats at the dose ranges tested. Picrotoxin antagonized motor impairment from all three drugs. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) antagonized only the effects of lorazepam, and isoniazid did not modify motor impairment induced by any of the three drugs. These results confirm that the selection of AT and ANT lines has not been specific to ethanol, and that it has increased sensitivity to ethanol, barbital, and lorazepam in the ANT rats rather than decreasing it in the AT rats relative to the M rats. The finding that picrotoxin counteracted motor impairment from ethanol, barbital, and lorazepam support the view that the GABAA receptor complex is important in mediating the intoxicating effects of these drugs. These results also suggest that the genetically-determined difference in sensitivity to ethanol between the rat lines involves GABAergic mechanisms, but it remains to be determined whether any part of the GABAA receptor itself has been affected by the selection program.", 
    "27": "Flunitrazepam (FZP) was administered intravenously, with success, to two patients with status epilepticus. Case 1 was a patient with a tonic-clonic status epilepticus. Intravenous phenytoin had no effect. Case 2 had minor status epilepticus. With the intravenous administration of FZP, diluted 1:10 with distilled water at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg at a slow rate, both patients were relieved of the status epilepticus. Unlike diazepam, FZP neither looks cloudy when diluted with distilled water nor causes angialgia. No disturbances in circulation or respiration occurred. Considering that FZP has a strong anticonvulsant action on status epilepticus, it can be expected to be a useful therapeutic agent for status epilepticus in infants and children.", 
    "28": "Amperozide given subcutaneously (0.25 mg/kg) depressed amphetamine-induced locomotor activity by 40%. In the absence of amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg), this dose of amperozide had no effect on locomotor activity during the 60 min test period. Amperozide (0.1-1 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased the locomotor activity of mice as measured in motron boxes. Only doses of amperozide greater than 0.25 mg/kg resulted in statistically significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in motor activity. Pretreatment of mice with flumazenil (10 mg/kg p.o., 30 min) or bicuculline (2 mg/kg i.p., 10 min) had no effect on amperozide (1 mg/kg)-induced hypomotility. These doses of the drugs had no effect per se. These results suggest that dopaminergic mechanisms might be involved in the amperozide-induced hypomotility.", 
    "29": "Both thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and RO 15-4513 antagonize ethanol-induced depression, but this common property does not infer that both compounds share similar mechanisms of action. In the present studies, both TRH (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and RO 15-4513 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed ethanol-induced depression of locomotor activity, in accord with previous reports. However, the benzodiazepine antagonist, RO 15-1788, blocked this action of RO 15-4513, while exerting no effect on the analeptic action of TRH. Using a model of seizure activity electrically elicited from the inferior colliculus, ethanol exerted a dose-related attenuation of seizure activity. This anticonvulsant action of ethanol was not altered by TRH (30 mg/kg, i.p.), but RO 15-4513 (3 mg/kg) reversed the effect of the 0.5, but not the 1.0 g/kg, dose of ethanol. In addition, pretreatment with RO 15-4513 (1 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.), but not TRH (30 mg/kg, i.p.), caused seizure generalization into the forebrain following inferior collicular stimulation, further verifying the proconvulsant properties of RO 15-4513. In conclusion, the analeptic action of TRH appears independent of benzodiazepine activity, and in contrast to RO 15-4513, TRH does not exhibit proconvulsant properties. Furthermore, because TRH did not antagonize both depressant actions of ethanol studied, it appears unlikely that TRH directly interacts with the molecular basis of ethanol action.", 
    "30": "Thirty-seven patients with major affective disorders according to DSM-III and on continuous lithium treatment were followed during a 7-year period. Outcome was assessed by use of the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale and by the need for additional psychotropic medication and for hospital and outpatient care. Anamnestic variables and patient's attitudes to their lithium medication were also included in the analysis of outcome, as were laboratory data, including lithium parameters. An increase in psychopathology was demonstrated in a significant number of patients and was attributed mainly to an increase in the depressive symptoms, with a significant increase in the rated scores for fatiguability, pessimistic thoughts, reduced sleep, and inner tension. Suicidal thoughts were common, but no suicide attempts were made. A significant number of patients complained of failing memory, but no significant progression was demonstrated during the 7-year study period. The increase in the depressive symptoms was closely correlated with the number of hospital admissions for depressive recurrence and with the number of days in hospital. The following factors showed a significant relationship with the increase in depressive symptoms: serum lithium levels, large increase in the elimination half-life of lithium, low level of social functioning, low TSH values, and need of concomitant administration of antidepressants and benzodiazepines.", 
    "31": "One hundred and eighty-six consecutive children aged between six and 72 months admitted to the Manchester Children's Hospitals with a febrile convulsion in the first year of life, a complicated febrile convulsion, or more than one febrile convulsion within two years, were allocated randomly to one of three groups who were offered rectal diazepam in the event of a subsequent prolonged febrile convulsion, or prophylactic treatment with sodium valproate or phenobarbitone. Over-all risk of recurrence was 30 per cent and adequate prophylactic treatment did not lessen this risk. Side-effects in 24 per cent of the valproate group and 61 per cent of the phenobarbitone group did not justify the use of prophylactic treatment.", 
    "32": "The benzodiazepines that have anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle-relaxant, and sedative-hypnotic properties affect respiration possibly by acting on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic receptors. This study investigated the effects of benzodiazepines diazepam and midazolam) applied topically to or microinjected just beneath the ventrolateral medullary surface (VMS) on airway tone in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated cats. Trachealis smooth muscle tension was assessed by measuring the changes in pressure in a balloon placed in a bypassed rostral segment of the trachea. In 21 cats ventilated with 7% CO2 in O2, surface application of benzodiazepines caused a significant decrease in tracheal tone. Similar to topical application, microinjection of midazolam (1 microgram) in the ventral medulla (0.1-0.2 mm from the surface) in six cats decreased tracheal pressure by 13.2 +/- 2.1 cmH2O (P less than 0.01). In addition, application of benzodiazepines on the VMS in animals ventilated with 12% O2 in N2 (n = 5) decreased tracheal pressure from 15.9 +/- 2.2 to 5.2 +/- 2.7 cmH2O (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, in all cats studied (n = 6), the magnitude of lung deflation-induced tracheal contraction was reduced after application of benzodiazepines on the ventral surface of the medulla (from 11.4 +/- 1.6 to 2.2 +/- 0.9 cmH2O; P less than 0.01). The effects of benzodiazepines on tracheal tone were reversed and blocked by application of Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepines antagonist. However, when parasympathetic activity was abolished by atropine and tracheal tone was restored with 5-hydroxytryptamine, benzodiazepines applied on the VMS had no effect on tracheal pressure. These results suggest that benzodiazepines acting centrally, on structures located near the VMS, can cause a decrease in airway smooth muscle tone by diminishing the activity of parasympathetic neurons which project to the airways.", 
    "33": "The regions adjacent to the ventrolateral medullary surface (VMS) play critical roles in the regulation of respiratory and cardiovascular function. Furthermore, these areas seem to be important sites for the integration of afferent inputs from certain sensory organs and the source of excitatory inputs to preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. To determine whether the VMS contributes to the generation of nonrespiratory-related periodic oscillations of arterial blood pressure (Mayer waves), excitatory substances, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), cholinergic agonists, and neuropeptides (substance P, neurokinin A, neurotensin), were applied topically to the intermediate area of VMS in anesthetized cats. In addition, the effects of application of lidocaine and inhibitory substances (benzodiazepines) on Mayer waves were studied. After application of excitatory substances to the VMS, we observed oscillations of arterial blood pressure, recurring with a period of 17.8 +/- 10 (SE) s, which had similar characteristics as the Mayer waves recorded during hypercapnia or hypoxia. In addition, cyclic changes in phrenic nerve activity and tracheal tone occurred with the same periodicity as arterial blood pressure oscillation. Application of lidocaine or benzodiazepines on the intermediate area of the VMS abolished Mayer waves observed during hypercapnia, hypoxia, or application of excitatory substances. These findings show for the first time that the VMS can be considered as one of several synaptic relays involved in the generation of arterial blood pressure oscillation, as well as the cyclic changes in phrenic nerve activity and tracheal smooth muscle tone that occur simultaneously.", 
    "34": "Effects of pirenzepine, known as a muscarinic receptor antagonist, on the contraction of dog gallbladder elicited by cholecystokinin (CCK) were examined in comparison with atropine and hexamethonium ones. Intraluminal gallbladder pressure in an in situ anaesthetized dog model was chosen for studying gallbladder motility. The intravenous administration of pirenzepine (0.75 mg/kg b.wt.), atropine (3 mg/kg b.wt.) or hexamethonium (5 mg/kg b.wt.) elicited a marked decrease in the increase of intraluminal gallbladder pressure induced by intravenous bolus injections of CCK (0.25-2 Ivy dog unit/kg b.wt.) and by continuous infusion of CCK (0.025-0.4 Ivy dog unit/kg b.wt./min). It was concluded that CCK induced gallbladder contractions were influenced by both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.", 
    "35": "Acute and long-term changes of ornithine decarboxylase and polyamines during pancreatic adaptation in response to cholecystokinin administration (1 microgram kg-1 body wt every 8 h) were studied in rats. alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible and specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, was applied simultaneously to elucidate the essential role of polyamines in pancreatic growth. In the cholecystokinin-treated animals ornithine decarboxylase activity was increased after 2 h, reached a maximum after 8 h (444.6 pmol 14CO2 h-1 mg-1 DNA, about 65-fold greater than controls, P less than 0.001) followed by a significant increase of putrescine after 6 h and spermidine after 24 h while spermine remained unchanged. The trophic parameters increased in the following time sequence: thymidine kinase (12 h), DNA polymerase (24 h), pancreatic weight (2 days), protein (2 days) and DNA (5 days). alpha-difluoromethylornithine significantly delayed the increase in ornithine decarboxylase, putrescine and spermidine as well as all trophic parameters. Increases in ornithine decarboxylase, polyamines and all trophic parameters were completely inhibited by simultaneous application of the CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. These data indicate an important role for ornithine decarboxylase and polyamines in cholecystokinin-induced pancreatic growth in rats.", 
    "36": "The present study was an attempt to clarify the role of noradrenaline (NA) and of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system in various nuclei in brain, as a component of a proposed neural circuit in the mediation of conflict behavior and the anticonflict action of anxiolytics. The authors investigated changes in the concentrations of NA, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in discrete regions of the brain in rats, in correlation with conflict behavior and also the effects of diazepam and suriclone. Noradrenergic neural activity diminished with a conflict situation, in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, mammillary body and dorsal hippocampus. 5-Hydroxytryptaminergic neural activity increased with a conflict situation in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, basolateral amygdala and medial septum. These changes in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, mammillary body and dorsal hippocampus were not observed when diazepam 20 mg/kg (p.o.) and suriclone 40 mg/kg (p.o.) produced anticonflict action. Suriclone normalized the increased 5-HT-ergic activity in the medial septum. The suppression of NA-ergic and the activation of 5-HT-ergic (except for the mammillary body) neural activity in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, mammillary body and dorsal hippocampus seemed to be linked to the mediation of conflict behavior. The facilitatory and inhibitory action on NA and 5-HT (except for the mammillary body) neurons, respectively, in these regions of the brain, may be involved in mechanisms underlying the anticonflict action of anxiolytics (diazepam or suriclone).", 
    "37": "The effects of benzodiazepine- and GABAA-receptor agonists and antagonists on the release and metabolism of 5-HT were measured in the ventral hippocampus of freely moving rats using microdialysis. Systemic injections of the benzodiazepine agonists, flurazepam and diazepam reduced the levels of 5-HT while the partial inverse agonist, FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide), had no effect. Local perfusion of flurazepam through the dialysis probe also decreased the release of 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus, an effect which was completely blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro15-1788 (flumazenil). Local application of the GABAA agonist muscimol had no effect on the release of 5-HT, while the antagonist picrotoxin, administered locally, caused a 4-fold enhancement of release of 5-HT. Picrotoxin also resulted in a complete block of the inhibitory effect of flurazepam on release of 5-HT. None of these drugs caused significant changes in the levels of the metabolite of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the ventral hippocampus. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of flurazepam on the release of 5-HT is mediated by benzodiazepine/GABAA receptors in the hippocampus and that GABA exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on the release of 5-HT in the region of the brain.", 
    "38": "The perioperative effects of administering sedative and analgesic drugs prior to outpatient surgery were evaluated. One hundred fifty adult outpatients were randomly assigned to one of six study groups according to a double-blind protocol design. Patients were given placebo (saline) or midazolam (5 mg im) 30-60 min prior to surgery, and then either placebo, oxymorphone (1 mg iv), or fentanyl (100 micrograms iv) 3-5 min prior to a standardized anesthetic technique. Preoperatively, midazolam premedication was associated with a significantly lower anxiety level (37 +/- 29 mm vs. 50 +/- 32 mm, P less than 0.05), higher sedation level (254 +/- 136 mm vs. 145 +/- 109 mm, P less than 0.01), worsening of psychomotor skill (5 +/- 5 vs. 2 +/- 2 dots missed, P less than 0.01; midazolam vs. placebo), and impaired recall abilities. In addition, use of midazolam did not prolong the discharge time. Compared to control patients, those who received fentanyl had a decreased incidence of intraoperative airway difficulties such as coughing (28% vs. 0%, P less than 0.01). Although use of opioids increased the incidence of postoperative nausea (42% vs. 18%, P less than 0.01) and vomiting (23% vs. 2%, P less than 0.01; opioid vs. no opioid), average recovery times were not affected by opioid administration. Oxymorphone use was associated with a lower incidence of pain at home compared with that following fentanyl (46% vs. 74%, P less than 0.05). Finally, preoperative administration of both midazolam and fentanyl or oxymorphone prior to a standardized methohexital-nitrous oxide anesthetic technique did not adversely affect recovery after outpatient surgery.", 
    "39": "Although exogenous administration of cholecystokinin (CCK) or dietary manipulation to increase circulating CCK have previously been shown to promote pancreatic growth, the role of CCK in controlling normal pancreatic development remains unclear. A potent CCK receptor antagonist, L364,718, was administered to rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters to block the effect of endogenous CCK. Animals were given continuous infusions of L364,718 (25 nmol.kg-1.h-1), CCK octapeptide [(CCK-8) 200 pmol.kg-1.h-1], or both CCK-8 and L364,718 for 14 and 28 days. Adult (4-mo-old) and young (4-wk-old) animals were used. CCK-8 and L364,718 were administered via separate, subcutaneously implanted mini-osmotic pumps. Infusions of CCK-8 alone for 28 days resulted in a 21.7% increase in wet pancreatic weight in 4-wk-old rats and a 22.7% increase in 4-wk-old guinea pigs (both P less than 0.001 compared with controls). Similar increases were found in DNA, RNA, and total protein contents. Coadministration of L364,718 totally blocked the trophic effects of exogenously infused CCK-8 in rats and guinea pigs. Administration of L364,718 alone in hamsters, guinea pigs, and rats for 14 and 28 days failed to alter the normal growth of the pancreas gland as measured by these parameters. Although elevated levels of CCK appear to promote a potent trophic response in the growing pancreas, this regulatory peptide does not appear to be an essential trophic factor for the normal growth of the exocrine pancreas in these animals.", 
    "40": "We used kainic acid-lesioned hippocampal slices to examine glial responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in a neuron-free environment. Slices were prepared from rats which received intracerebroventricular injections of kainic acid 1 month prior to experiments. Astrocytes (membrane potential averaged 81.4 +/- 5.5 mV; n = 46; mean +/- SD) were impaled in the CA3 region of the slice, which was completely depleted of neurons. GABA (1 mM) application by bath perfusion depolarized membrane potential from 1 to 5 mV. The GABA-induced depolarization was not affected by a tetrodotoxin (1 microM)/high-Mg2+/low-Ca2+ solution. Changing the Cl- equilibrium potential by reducing extracellular Cl- greatly increased the GABA-induced depolarization. Muscimol mimicked the GABA response, while picrotoxin (0.1 mM), an antagonist of the GABA-activated Cl- channel, resulted in a 60% blockade. The barbiturate, pentobarbital (0.1 mM), and the benzodiazepine agonist, flunitrazepam (1 mM), enhanced the depolarization by 60 and 40%, respectively. A blocker of glial GABA uptake, beta-alanine (1 mM), did not affect the GABA-induced membrane depolarization, indicating that the depolarization is not caused by electrogenic uptake of the amino acid. The pharmacological properties of the GABA response of astrocytes from the hippocampal slice is similar to that previously described for cultured astrocytes from rat cerebral hemispheres. Our data suggest that GABA receptors, which are coupled to Cl- channels, are also expressed by astrocytes in an intact tissue.", 
    "41": "Exogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) decreases food intake and causes satiety in animals and man. However, it has not been established that endogenous CCK causes satiety or whether the response is mediated by peripheral-type (CCK-A) or brain-type (CCK-B) receptors. The development of potent and selective antagonists for CCK-A (MK-329) and CCK-B (L-365,260) receptors now allows these issues to be addressed. The CCK-A antagonist MK-329 and the CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 increased food intake in partially satiated rats and postponed the onset of satiety; however, L-365,260 was 100 times more potent than MK-329 in increasing feeding and preventing satiety. These results suggest that endogenous CCK causes satiety by an agonist action on CCK-B receptors in the brain.", 
    "42": "A sensitive isocratic high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described, which allows the precise and accurate quantification of flurazepam and four metabolites with a single determination. A pharmacokinetic study was performed on nine volunteers and the main pharmacokinetic data are reported. The method was used to demonstrate that monodesethylflurazepam and didesethylflurazepam are major metabolites in men. One more unidentified flurazepam metabolite was detected.", 
    "43": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of an oxadiazole-substituted 1,4-benzodiazepine [3-(5-cyclopropyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo -4H-imidazo[1,5a] [1,4]benzodiazepine] in plasma has been developed and compared with a radioreceptor assay. The results given by the two methods were in good agreement, with detection limits of ca. 1 ng/ml (signal-to-noise ratio = 3). The radioreceptor method is preferred for the monitoring of toxicological and other well controlled studies, while HPLC is preferred where greater specificity is essential. Further, the HPLC assay is applicable over a much wider concentration range.", 
    "44": "A highly sensitive capillary gas chromatographic method was developed to determine plasma levels of a novel partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist in man following the very low therapeutic doses required for anxiolysis. The compound was isolated from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction at basic pH, converted into the ethyl ester analogue by a two-step procedure, separated from plasma constituents by capillary gas chromatography and quantified by means of nitrogen-selective detection. Because of the thermolabile tert.-butyl ester function, the agonist could not be gas chromatographed without degradation. Formation of the far more stable ethyl ester analogue was achieved by treatment with hydrogen chloride in ethanol, followed by an ethylation step with diazoethane. The high sensitivity of the new method (about 100 pg/ml, using 1-ml plasma specimens) allowed the monitoring of plasma levels of the agonist for up to 8 h (about three elimination half-lives) after a single 0.1-mg oral dose to human volunteers. The practicability of the procedure was demonstrated by the analysis of more than 600 plasma samples from clinical studies performed with human volunteers.", 
    "45": "This study characterizes the presynaptic muscarinic cholinergic receptors associated with the modulation of the electrically-evoked acetylcholine output from guinea pig superior cervical ganglion preincubated with [3H]choline. The M1-selective agonist pilocarpine had no effect while carbachol and oxotremorine strongly decreased the evoked outflow of tritium. Atropine increased such evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine whereas the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine was ineffective. Moreover, atropine but not pirenzepine antagonized the inhibitory effect of carbachol. These results suggest that the guinea-pig superior cervical ganglion is equipped with presynaptic inhibitory muscarinic receptors of the M2 subtype.", 
    "46": "101 critically ill patients admitted to five intensive-care units were allocated randomly to receive a continuous intravenous infusion of either propofol or midazolam for sedation for up to 24 h. In addition, morphine was given to provide analgesia. The mean duration of infusion was 20.2 h (range 3.0-24.5) in the propofol group and 21.3 h (4.0-47.0) in the midazolam group and infusion rates were 1.77 mg/kg/h (range 0.40-5.00) and 0.10 mg/kg/h (0.01-0.26), respectively. The infusion rates were adjusted as necessary, and the desired level of sedation was achieved easily in most patients in both groups. There were slight falls in arterial pressure, but there were no significant differences between the groups. Heart rate was lower in patients who received propofol. Some small changes occurred in biochemical and haematological variables in both groups, but they were not clinically significant. There was no indication that either drug substantially impaired adrenal steroidogenesis. When the infusion was discontinued, there was less variability in recovery of consciousness in patients who had received propofol. In a subgroup of patients, weaning from mechanical ventilation was achieved significantly faster after discontinuation of propofol than of midazolam. Propofol proved to be a satisfactory agent for sedation of these critically ill patients and compared favourably with midazolam.",

    "48": "GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid A)-benzodiazepine receptors expressed in mammalian cells and assembled from one of three different alpha subunit variants (alpha 1, alpha 2, or alpha 3) in combination with a beta 1 and a gamma 2 subunit display the pharmacological properties of either type I or type II receptor subtypes. These receptors contain high-affinity binding sites for benzodiazepines. However, CL 218 872, 2-oxoquazepam, and methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) show a temperature-modulated selectivity for alpha 1 subunit-containing receptors. There were no significant differences in the binding of clonazepam, diazepam, Ro 15-1788, or dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) to all three recombinant receptors. Receptors containing the alpha 3 subunit show greater GABA potentiation of benzodiazepine binding than receptors containing the alpha 1 or alpha 2 subunit, indicating that there are subtypes within the type II class. Thus, diversity in benzodiazepine pharmacology is generated by heterogeneity of the alpha subunit of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "49": "The effects of chronic treatment with phenytoin (50 mg/kg p.o. daily, for the first 30 days after birth) on GABAA and beta-adrenoceptors in the rat cerebellum were investigated by using in vitro quantitative autoradiography and binding assays with membranes. A significant decrease in [3H]muscimol binding to GABAA sites and, to a lesser extent, [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine sites was observed in the granular and molecular layers of the cerebellar cortex at the end of the treatment. Scatchard analyses demonstrated that these effects were associated with a decreased Bmax for the respective binding sites in cerebellar membranes the (Kd was not changed). In contrast, [125I]cyanopindolol binding remained unaffected. These data provide further support for the involvement of GABAergic synapses in the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin.", 
    "50": "The present study shows that the putative M2 ligand, [3H]AF-DX 116, binds to two classes of muscarinic sites in homogenates of rat hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex: one with a high affinity (Kd less than 5 nM)/low capacity (Bmax = 30-63 fmol/mg protein), and a second of lower affinity (Kd greater than 65 nM) and higher capacity (Bmax greater than 190 fmol/mg protein). In experiments which tested the effects of the muscarinic antagonists on acetylcholine (ACh) release from brain slices, the non-selective antagonist (-)-quinuclidinyl benzylate and atropine significantly enhanced the potassium (25 mM)-evoked release of ACh. This effect was mimicked by the M2 ligand AF-DX 116, but neither the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine, nor the putative M3-muscarinic antagonist, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP), altered ACh release. Also, the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine, significantly depressed evoked ACh release from brain slices, an effect that was completely antagonized by atropine or by AF-DX 116, but not by pirenzepine or 4-DAMP. Thus, it appears that presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors in the rat hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex belong to the M2 subtype of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "51": "Flumazenil (Lanexat) is the first specific benzodiazepine-antagonist for clinical use. In several controlled investigations, a significant rapidly commencing antagonistic effect on the central effects of benzodiazepines has been demonstrated. Flumazenil possesses only slight side effects which may easily be treated. The immediate indications for employing flumazenil are reversal of the sedation caused by benzodiazepines in outpatients and treatment of cases of poisoning. In addition, flumazenil could be employed to reverse sedation produced by benzodiazepines during general anaesthesia and prolonged sedation in intensive care units. The following should be observed on employing flumazenil: 1. Flumazenil should be administered by slow meticulous titration. 2. The relatively short half-life of flumazenil provides the possibility for partial return of CNS depression. 3. In cases of mixed poisoning, flumazenil may unmask the effects of possible seizure-producing drugs. 4. Care should be employed in using flumazenil in chronic benzodiazepine abusers.", 
    "52": "In The Netherlands accidental intoxications in children due to benzodiazepines are regularly encountered. In 1987 of 1630 requests for information at the National Poison Control Centre about probable benzodiazepine intoxications 144 (8.8%) concerned children 0-12 years of age. The symptoms of this type of intoxication are non-specific and if the physician does not think of benzodiazepine intoxication extensive diagnostic procedures may be performed. If children show symptoms e.g. unconsciousness, ataxia and hypotonia, the physician should always think of benzodiazepine intoxication and try to confirm or to exclude this possibility by toxicological analysis. We discuss ways and means of the diagnosis and how to avoid pitfalls on the way.", 
    "53": "The effects of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) on autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were examined in dogs receiving midazolam and in dogs not receiving midazolam. Both groups were anesthetized with halothane (0.3% end-expired) and nitrous oxide (66%) in oxygen. Auto-regulation of CBF was assessed by determining the slope relating CBF to cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). These CBF/CPP slopes were derived from measurements of CBF at each of three CPPs: 65, 80, and 95 mm Hg. The effects of flumazenil on autoregulation were examined by comparing CBF/CPP slopes prior to administration of flumazenil to CBF/CPP slopes after flumazenil doses of 0.0025 and 0.16 mg/kg, both when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was normal and when CSF pressure was elevated to 30 mm Hg. Prior to administration of flumazenil, CBF/CPP slopes were not different from zero, indicating intact autoregulation of CBF. CBF/CPP slopes did not change following administration of flumazenil, indicating that autoregulation of CBF was not substantially impaired. In dogs with normal CSF pressure that were receiving midazolam, both doses of flumazenil altered the electroencephalogram and the highest dose of flumazenil decreased cerebral vascular resistance and increased CBF and CSF pressure. No such changes were seen at the other experimental conditions. It is concluded that flumazenil does not severely disturb autoregulation of CBF, although flumazenil 0.16 mg/kg causes a statistically significant increase of CBF in dogs with normal CSF pressure that are receiving midazolam.", 
    "54": "Four groups of five rats each received training on the Geller-Seifter procedure and then received 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg diazepam (DZ) or vehicle, respectively, 15 min prior to the behavior sessions for 14 days. On Day 14 of DZ treatment rats also were administered 2.0 g/kg of ethanol (EtOH) 30 min prior to testing. Significant dose-related decreases in lever pressing occurred between groups over the 13 days of DZ treatment during the pre- and posttone periods. However, a significant effect attributable to days occurred only in the pretone period. During the tone period, the dose-related effects were greater but the variability also increased and specific contrasts between individual means were not significant. The largest increases in lever pressing associated with an anxiolytic effect occurred with 1.0 mg/kg of DZ at Day 6. On Day 14, all animals received 2.0 g/kg of EtOH and their performance was compared to performance on Day 13. During the pre- and posttone periods, the EtOH resulted in significantly less lever pressing in the control, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg DZ groups, indicating a sedative effect. Rats treated with 1.0 mg/kg of DZ did not exhibit this EtOH reduction in lever pressing. During the tone or conflict period, a significant dose-related increase in lever pressing due to the EtOH was observed. The increase in the control group was not significant. During repeated exposure to DZ there was a small but significant decrease in number of reinforcements which was enhanced by the EtOH at the 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg DZ doses but not at 1.0 mg/kg DZ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "The clinical effects of tofisopam were studied on 29 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Tofisopam was administered at a dose of 50 mg three times a day for more than 2 weeks. The clinical effects of tofisopam were revealed to be 79% in all patients. Only one patient (3%) complained of thirst. These results suggest that tofisopam is an effective drug to treat lower urinary tract symptoms.", 
    "56": "Steady-state plasma levels of nortriptyline and E- and Z-10-OH-nortriptyline were determined in 55 depressed patients during long-term treatment. Dose-corrected steady-state levels varied by a factor of 20 for nortriptyline, a factor of 7 for E-10-OH-nortriptyline (sum of enantiomers), and a factor of 12 for Z-10-OH-nortriptyline (sum of enantiomers). The E-10-OH-nortriptyline levels were higher than the corresponding nortriptyline levels in about 50% of the patients and the nortriptyline/E-10-OH-nortriptyline ratio ranged from 0.27 to 4.8. In contrast to E-10-OH-nortriptyline, the steady-state levels of Z-10-OH-nortriptyline correlated significantly with the nortriptyline levels (rs = 0.68, n = 55, p less than 0.001) and the nortriptyline/Z-10-OH-nortriptyline ranged from 1.7 to 10. Patients on concurrent treatment with perphenazine or benzodiazepines had higher nortriptyline and nortriptyline/E-10-OH-nortriptyline ratios than patients taking lithium or no other psychotropic drugs. A sparteine test was carried out in 22 patients and the sparteine metabolic ratio correlated significantly with the dose-corrected steady-state levels of nortriptyline (rs = 0.62, p less than 0.01) and E-10-OH-nortriptyline (rs = -0.52, p less than 0.02) and particularly well with the ratio nortriptyline/E-10-OH-nortriptyline (rs = 0.83). The genetic variability in the sparteine/debrisoquine P-450 isozyme appeared to be clearly more important for the interindividual variation in 10-hydroxylation of nortriptyline than the possible interactions with concurrent medication.", 
    "57": "Over a six-month period, the utilization and safety of fluspirilene were investigated in 230 nonpsychotic outpatients in twelve private psychiatric practices. The patients treated under routine treatment conditions were about 20 years older than those included in experimental studies with this drug. In contrast to expert recommendations, 21.7% of the patients had received repeated injections of fluspirilene for longer than three months. A total of 46.1% of patients had been comedicated from time to time with antidepressants, while 30% had received benzodiazepines, indicating that fluspirilene is used as an alternative, but also as a supplementary treatment to benzodiazepine tranquilizers. Adverse reactions, probably related to fluspirilene, were recorded in 8.7% of patients and led to discontinuation of treatment in 3.9%. Disturbances of the extrapyramidal system predominated (in 5.6% of patients), with akathisia being observed most often (in 3.5%). It is concluded that the application of fluspirilene would seem to be safe if the drug is administered in the recommended way, but that there is a risk of tardive dyskinesias in the case of higher doses, longer duration of use, or pre-existing cerebral lesions (as manifested by two patients included in this survey).", 
    "58": "The muscarinic receptor present in chicken cardiac membranes was characterised using a ligand binding approach and compared to the M1, M2 and M3 receptors that can be identified in ligand binding studies at present. [3H]N-methylscopolamine and [3H]pirenzepine appeared to label the same population of muscarinic receptors in chicken cardiac membranes since the density of sites labeled by the two radioligands was similar. Furthermore, affinity estimates of 8 muscarinic receptor antagonists for chicken cardiac muscarinic receptors were the same irrespective of whether [3H]N-methylscopolamine or [3H]pirenzepine was used as the radioligand. The chicken cardiac muscarinic receptor displayed high affinity for pirenzepine (pKi = 7.9) and so did not appear to represent an M2 receptor. Despite the high affinity of chicken cardiac muscarinic receptors for pirenzepine, affinity estimates for dicyclomine (pKi = 8.0), CPPS (pKi = 8.4) and 4DAMP (pKi = 8.6) in chicken heart were not consistent with the presence of M1 receptors. The chicken cardiac muscarinic receptor also displayed significant differences to the M3 receptor since it displayed high affinity for AF-DX 116 (pKi = 7.1) and methoctramine (pKi = 8.4). Finally, chicken heart muscarinic receptors displayed high affinity for gallamine (pKi = 7.0) and pirenzepine suggesting that the receptor was different to the M4 muscarinic receptor of the NG108-15 cell line. These findings suggest that chicken heart expresses a novel muscarinic receptor subtype distinct from the M1, M2, M3, and M4 subtypes already described.", 
    "59": "The sedative effects of the low dose of butorphanol combined with diazepam during spinal-epidural (H-type) anesthesia were studied in 20 urological or gynecological patients of ASA class I or II. Patients were premedicated with 0.5mg of atropine sulfate and 50mg of hydroxyzine hydrochloride 1 hour before the operation. Spinal anesthesia was performed with 2.4 ml of 0.3% dibucaine or 2.5 ml of 3% lidocaine and if necessary 1-2% mepivacaine was administered via the catheter for maintenance of the epidural anesthesia. Butorphanol 0.5 mg and diazepam 5 mg were administered intravenously after the establishment of spinal anesthesia. We observed the condition of sedative effects, the changes in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate, before the administration of butorphanol, 2 and 5 minutes after the administration of the drug and then every 5 minutes until the recovery was noticed. We found that the sedative effects of butorphanol combined with diazepam were clinically sufficient. Patients were sleeping for 40 minutes and then drowsy for 30 minutes with sufficient sedation. There was no complication except slight respiratory suppression. Our results suggest that the butorphanol combined with diazepam is a useful method for the sedation during spinal-epidural anesthesia.", 
    "60": "A combination of midazolam and alfentanil was used on 24 patients for induction of general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was maintained with N2O/O2 and repeated injections of alfentanil. The mean operation time was 40.8 min. At the end of surgery the patients recovered 4.8 min after antagonisation of the alfentanil with naloxon, and the endotracheal tube could be removed. Thirty, 60 and 120 min after extubation the patients were asked to perform a Marschner's test, which measures the ability to concentrate on fast intellectual work. Up to 660 simple arithmetical additions could be checked within 7.5 min. The intellectual performance recovered quickly: after 30 min 79% of the pre-operative values were reached, after 60 min 85% and after 120 min 90%. Midazolam is suitable as an induction agent for shortlasting otorhinolaryngological surgery.", 
    "61": "1. The effect of tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) on cholinergically mediated behaviour in the rat and mouse has been investigated. In addition the actions of this compound on cholinesterase activity and on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors has also been examined. 2. Administration of THA (5-20 mg kg-1, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent increase in tremor, hypothermia and salivation in both rats and mice. A similar profile of activity was seen following physostigmine (0.1-0.6 mg kg-1) administration. 3. THA was approximately fifty fold less potent than physostigmine in inducing behavioural change but its effects persisted for over twice as long as those of physostigmine. For example THA-induced hypothermia was still present at 4 h in the mouse and 8 h in the rat. 4. In vitro THA was a potent non-competitive inhibitor of rat brain cholinesterase (IC50: 57 +/- 6 nM) and bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (IC50: 50 +/- 10 nM) but was a more potent inhibitor of horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (IC50: 7.2 +/- 1.4 nM). 5. Radioligand binding studies indicated that THA binds non-selectively but with moderate potency to both M1 (Ki: 600 nM) and M2 (Ki: 880 nM) muscarinic receptors. THA also interacted with the allosteric site present on cardiac M2 receptors. 6. It is concluded that THA is a reversible non-competitive inhibitor of cholinesterase with a long half life (compared with physostigmine). It also may antagonize muscarinic receptors at high doses. The long half life may account for its reported efficacy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "62": "We have studied the effect of sedation with midazolam on arterial oxygen saturation during spinal anaesthesia in two groups of patients: one group received supplementary oxygen, the other group breathed room air. A significant reduction in oxygen saturation was observed in patients not receiving supplementary oxygen; six of 15 patients in this group developed hypoxaemia or severe hypoxaemia which was corrected immediately by administration of oxygen. There were no episodes of hypoxaemia in any patient in the group receiving supplementary oxygen. It is concluded that oxygen should be administered routinely to patients receiving sedatives during spinal anaesthesia.", 
    "63": "An infusion of propofol was compared with intravenous boluses of diazepam as sedation for minor oral surgery under local anaesthesia in 12 healthy patients who had elective bilateral surgical extraction of lower third molars; the patients served as their own controls. Plasma catecholamine, vasopressin and cortisol concentrations were determined from repeated blood samples. The total administered dose of propofol was 3.93 (SD 1.34) mg/kg and of diazepam 0.28 (SD 0.07) mg/kg. No cardiovascular depression or airway problems occurred. Other side effects were also rare but some discomfort on injection was frequent with propofol. Recovery times were faster after propofol than after diazepam as assessed by the Maddox wing and visual analogue scales. Propofol also provided better amnesia compared to diazepam at the time of the extraction of the teeth. Eight of the 12 patients subjectively preferred propofol sedation. There was no hormonal stress response in either group.", 
    "64": "A hospital-pharmacy-based program to decrease inappropriate prescribing of triazolam is described, and the program's effect on triazolam prescribing patterns for both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients is reported. Pharmacists developed criteria for the triazolam \"target drug program\" in cooperation with the pharmacy and therapeutics committee. Pharmacists contacted prescribers when bedtime triazolam doses were ordered that (1) exceeded 0.125 mg, (2) were for patients greater than or equal to 60 years of age, and (3) were not to be given immediately before a surgical or diagnostic procedure. The pharmacists recommended to the prescribers that triazolam be started at a dosage of 0.125 mg in elderly or debilitated patients and that the dosage be adjusted according to the patient's response, with a repeat dose given if appropriate. Data were collected on triazolam use in the hospital before and after the pharmacist intervention program began. Data also were collected on sales of triazolam to community pharmacies near the hospital. The number of inpatient triazolam orders meeting the criteria for intervention decreased. The percentage of inpatient interventions that resulted in a dosage change also decreased, probably because prescribers' orders for higher triazolam dosages were more likely to be appropriate after the target drug program. Community pharmacies purchased more 0.125-mg triazolam tablets and fewer tablets of greater strengths after the target drug program. Intervention by hospital pharmacists caused a change in the inpatient prescribing pattern for triazolam and appeared to cause a parallel change in the community surrounding the hospital.", 
    "65": "A 74-year-old woman experienced an apparent psychotic reaction several hours after administration of iv midazolam as a premedicant for gastroscopy. The reaction included confusion, hallucinations, and hostility and required administration of haloperidol to calm her. The woman subsequently underwent colonoscopy with meperidine as a premedication and experienced no behavioral changes. Although other causes cannot be completely ruled out, the evidence points strongly to midazolam as the precipitating agent for the psychotic reaction.", 
    "66": "Butorphanol/diazepam was compared with thiopental for induction of anesthesia, and the thiopental-sparing effects of butorphanol/diazepam determined. One hundred women, American Society of Anesthesiology physical status class I, undergoing ambulatory, elective termination of pregnancy were randomized to receive either butorphanol 2 mg plus diazepam 10 mg, or thiopental, until loss of the lid reflex occurred. The butorphanol/diazepam group received supplemental thiopental as necessary to attain adequate induction of anesthesia. The combination of butorphanol and diazepam significantly reduced the thiopental dose required to produce loss of the lid reflex, from 4.2 +/- 0.8 to 0.8 +/- 0.6 mg/kg (p less than 0.005), with 22 percent of the patients not requiring supplemental thiopental. The intraoperative course and anesthetic requirements were similar between the two groups. Lower recovery room rating scale values upon arrival at the recovery room were attributed to significantly higher weight-normalized doses of butorphanol (p = 0.004) and diazepam (p = 0.005). The duration of the recovery room stay was 68.8 +/- 24.9 min for the control group, and 80.8 +/- 29.0 min for the butorphanol/diazepam-treated patients (p = 0.026). There were no clinically significant differences in anesthesia or postanesthesia recovery. The combination of butorphanol and diazepam has a significant thiopental-sparing effect, and is a useful induction technique for short, ambulatory surgical procedures.", 
    "67": "The effects of perioperative psychiatric intervention were studied in 33 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. All patients were evaluated preoperatively using the Mini-Mental State Exam and the Psychological Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report. Participants in the study group (N = 16) had a structured psychiatric interview prior to surgery and were followed daily with supportive psychotherapy throughout their hospitalization. The number of medical complications was higher in the control group. No significant differences were found in neurologic or psychologic complications. The study group used significantly more oxycodone-acetaminophen (Percocet), but less morphine-sulfate or benzodiazepine on postoperative days 3, 4, and 6. The mean length of stay was 3 days shorter for patients in the study group. In the current era of escalating health care costs and high technology, clinical protocols and research studies that evaluate the cost effectiveness and efficacy of psychiatric intervention in medically ill patients should be pursued.", 
    "68": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of diazepam (DZ) to elicit a response in the brains of developing animals. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in the presence and absence of DZ was measured in synaptoneurosomal preparations from whole brain of fetal rats at 20 and 21 days gestation and from cerebral cortex of rats at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60-90 days postnatal age. The ability of GABA to stimulate 36Cl- uptake in a concentration-dependent manner was evident from gestational day 20. The EC50 for GABA stimulation but not the maximum stimulation increased significantly from day 20 to day 21 of gestation. Postnatally, only moderate changes in the EC50 were evident, but the maximum 36Cl- transported increased significantly from 7 to 14 days and remained stable thereafter. DZ enhanced GABA-mediated 36Cl- influx from 20 days gestation, and this enhancement was seen as a decrease in the EC50 for GABA stimulation. However, DZ also significantly increased maximum GABA-stimulated 36Cl- transport in synaptoneurosomal preparations at 21 days gestation and at 7 days postnatal age, a response to DZ not seen at older ages. DZ had a less robust effect on GABA-mediated 36Cl- transport at 28 days postnatal age than at any other age, a result consistent with functional observations of decreased responsivity to DZ in late juvenile, early adolescent rats. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 prevented the effect of DA on GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in tissue from 21-day fetuses and from 60- to 90-day-old adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (END-IR) were determined in 11 female and 6 male patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of panic disorder (PD) and in matched controls. Eleven of the PD patients had been taking moderate doses of benzodiazepines (BZD) irregularly without satisfactory effect against the panic attacks while six were totally drug-free. No medication was allowed for at least 24 hours before the lumbar puncture. In six patients a second lumbar puncture was performed after 2 to 3 months of treatment with imipramine or clomipramine. In PD patients, CSF levels of END-IR were significantly higher than in controls. Patients that had been taking BZD had somewhat higher concentrations of END-IR than those taking no medication; however, totally drug-free patients also displayed END-IR levels that were significantly higher than in controls. Although they effected a dramatic reduction of the panic attacks, antidepressants did not influence CSF END-IR concentrations.", 
    "70": "Interscalene brachial plexus block is a simple and effective alternative to intravenous benzodiazepines or general anaesthesia for manipulation of the dislocated shoulder. Thirty interscalene brachial plexus blocks were performed on 29 patients with dislocations of the shoulder to provide regional anaesthesia for reduction. Pain was abolished by 14 out of the 30 blocks performed, improved by 13 and unchanged by three. Muscle relaxation (MRC grade 3 or less) occurred in 21 patients. In 26 cases the block allowed reduction of the dislocation without additional analgesia or sedative. Reduction was not possible in four cases. There were no significant complications.", 
    "71": "The phenomenon of alcohol withdrawal has seldom been studied in subgroups of patients in withdrawal. We developed a rating scale for measuring alcohol withdrawal that we found to be reliable and valid. The scale, when applied to young (ages 21-33, N = 24) and elderly (ages 58-77, N = 26) groups of patients in alcohol withdrawal, indicated that the elderly group initially had a more severe withdrawal for which they received higher doses of chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "72": "The antagonism of muscarinic receptor-mediated contraction of rat trachea by a range of muscarinic antagonists was quantified by Schild and resultant analysis. Dose-response curves to carbachol, muscarine and oxotremorine were shifted to the right by gallamine and pirenzepine in a parallel manner with no change in maximal response ostensibly indicating simple competitive inhibition. However, Schild analysis indicated differences in the blockade and estimated pKb values with each agonist for both gallamine and pirenzepine. This suggested either that the responses to these three agonists were mediated by a heterogeneous receptor population in this tissue or that the blockade produced by gallamine and by pirenzepine was not competitive. Further Schild analysis with the muscarinic antagonists scopolamine, atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide and (11 [(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine 6-one) with carbachol, muscarine and oxotremorine indicated simple competitive antagonism of a homogeneous population of muscarinic receptors. Therefore, the competitivity of binding of atropine, gallamine and pirenzepine with the scopolamine binding site was measured with the recently reported technique of resultant analysis. With this method the effect of various concentrations of the test antagonist on the antagonism produced by specified concentrations of the reference antagonist scopolamine was measured and the equilibrium dissociation constant of the test antagonist-receptor complex estimated. These data indicated that atropine and scopolamine bind to a common binding site on the muscarinic receptor, but that scopolamine and both gallamine and pirenzepine bind to mutually exclusive sites. This result is mine and pirenzepine are allosteric modulators of muscarinic receptors which bind at sites other than that utilized by agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "Various kinetic models have been developed to describe the elimination of substances by the liver, but there is no agreement about which model is the most appropriate, as experimental evaluation is incomplete and results conflict. We have shown previously that hepatic elimination of taurocholate is best described by models that embody a high degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing, whereas another study showed that elimination of diazepam is best described by models that embody a low degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing. To investigate this discrepancy we examined, in the isolated perfused rat liver, the simultaneous elimination of taurocholate and diazepam. The effect on hepatic availability of varying unbound fraction (fu) in a single pass, steady-state system was studied in six experiments for taurocholate (fu, 0.066-0.966) and diazepam (fu, 0.051-0.675) by varying perfusate albumin concentration (0-60 g l-1). As before, elimination of taurocholate was best described by models that embody a high degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing (i.e., venous equilibrium model, dispersion model with dispersion number = infinity). Diazepam elimination was best described by models that embody a low degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing (undistributed sinusoidal model, dispersion model with low dispersion number = 1.04). A third model, a distributed model incorporating heterogeneity of sinusoidal blood flows and intrinsic clearances, fitted the data for both taurocholate and diazepam. The fitted coefficients of variation of both flow and intrinsic clearance among the sinusoids were large for taurocholate (176 and 164, respectively), but for diazepam blood flow was large (200) whereas that for intrinsic clearance was small (0.807).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "The tumor-promoting ability of clonazepam (CZP), a widely used benzodiazepine anticonvulsant, was investigated in an in vivo mouse liver tumor promotion assay and an in vitro mouse hepatocyte intercellular communication assay. The development of preneoplastic hepatocellular foci of cellular alteration and hepatocellular neoplasms was studied in male B6C3F1 mice initiated, at 5 weeks of age, with a single i.p. injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA; 90 mg/kg body weight) in tricaprylin, followed by administration of either phenobarbital (PB; 0.05%) or CZP (0.068% or 0.136%) in diet beginning 2 weeks after carcinogen injection and continuing to 60 weeks of age. Several mice from each group were killed after 9, 21, 33 or 53 weeks on test diet, and portions of liver and other organs were fixed in formalin and examined histologically. Unlike PB, CZP did not promote the development of preneoplastic hepatocellular foci or neoplasms (adenomas and carcinomas) in NDEA-initiated mice. Following limited (2 weeks) dietary exposure at 0.15%, CZP was a potent inducer of hepatic P450IIB1-mediated alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities. In contrast, the degree of induction in hepatic tissue from mice fed 0.136% CZP for 53 weeks was markedly lower than that in mice fed 0.05% PB for 53 weeks. In the in vitro assay, diazepam, a strong tumor promoter in mouse liver, significantly inhibited mouse hepatocyte gap junctional intercellular communication, while CZP had no significant effect on this parameter. Thus, CZP, a drug structurally related to diazepam, is inactive as a liver tumor promoter in mice.", 
    "75": "In 100 consecutive adults who came to a sleep disorders center complaining of repeated nocturnal injury, polysomnographic study identified five disorders: night terrors/sleepwalking (N = 54), REM sleep behavior disorder (N = 36), dissociative disorders (N = 7), nocturnal seizures (N = 2), and sleep apnea (N = 1). Ninety-five patients sustained ecchymoses, 30 had lacerations, and nine had fractures. DSM-III axis I disorders (past or current) were found in 48.1% of the group with night terrors/sleepwalking and in 30.6% of the group with REM sleep behavior disorder; these were mainly affective disorders. In these two groups, clonazepam controlled the symptoms of 51 of the 61 patients to whom it was given.", 
    "76": "Serum, plasma, and postmortem blood treated with two volumes of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and centrifuged, were directly analyzable by means of the EMIT d.a.u. reagents on the Syva Autocarousel in the same manner as urine. Cutoff values in milligrams (immunochemically cross-reactive analyte equivalents)/L are 0.05 for morphine (MOR), 0.15 for benzoylecgonine (BZE), 0.20 for oxazepam (OX), and 0.02 for 11-nor-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (THCC). The relationship of concentrations (micrograms/mL serum) to absorbance changes (delta A) were S-shaped up to greater than 3.0 for MOR, 4.0 for BZE, greater than 5.0 for OX, and 0.2 for THCC. Beyond these maximal concentrations, delta A values declined. Thus, negatives should be repeated on substantially diluted aliquots to avoid missing extraordinarily high positives. \"False\" quantitative negative/positive noncongruence between total EMIT cross-reactives and free-drug analyses by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were 0/17 (N = 75) for opiates, 8/0 (N = 119) for cocaine products, and 19/5 (N = 103) for cannabinoids. For benzodiazepines (N = 58) the \"false\" negative/\"false\" positive ratio of EMIT (total)/high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (free) was 4/4.

For between-day precision, quantitative estimates varied by 8% for MOR, 15% for BZE, 18% for OX, and 34% for THCC.", 
    "77": "Hallucinogenic drugs are unique in that they produce the desired hallucinogenic effects at what are considered non-toxic doses. The hallucinogenic drugs can be categorised into 4 basic groups: indole alkaloid derivatives, piperidine derivatives, phenylethylamines and the cannabinols. The drugs reviewed include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, marijuana, psilocybin, mescaline, and 'designer drugs.' Particularly noteworthy is that each hallucinogen produces characteristic behavioural effects which are related to its serotonergic, dopaminergic or adrenergic activity. Cocaine produces simple hallucinations, PCP can produce complex hallucinations analogous to a paranoid psychosis, while LSD produces a combination of hallucinations, pseudohallucinations and illusions. Dose relationships with changes in the quality of the hallucinatory experience have been described with amphetamines and, to some extent, LSD. Flashbacks have been described with LSD and alcohol. Management of the intoxicated patient is dependent on the specific behavioural manifestation elicited by the drug. The principles involve differentiating the patient's symptoms from organic (medical or toxicological) and psychiatric aetiologies and identifying the symptom complex associated with the particular drug. Panic reactions may require treatment with a benzodiazepine or haloperidol. Patients with LSD psychosis may require an antipsychotic. Patients exhibiting prolonged drug-induced psychosis may require a variety of treatments including ECT, lithium and l-5-hydroxytryptophan.", 
    "78": "The extent of local irritation after rectal administration of diazepam in solution was studied in 24 adults (mean weight of 70 kg). The trial was randomized using a triple cross-over design. A burning sensation was reported in 60%, 12% and 0% of subjects up to 15 min after administration of diazepam 35 mg, diazepam 10 mg and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic assessment 24 h after medication showed mechanical irritation in three subjects and local irritation probably caused by diazepam, the vehicle, or both, in four. No correlation was found between subjective complaints and objective findings. Control endoscopy 7 days after medication revealed no pathology. It is suggested that a rectal solution of diazepam in doses up to 0.5 mg kg-1 is a safe form of medication in respect of irritation of the rectal mucosa.", 
    "79": "Two groups of 25 patients were sedated during neuroradiological investigation. The first group was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam while the other was given fentanyl and a two-stage infusion of propofol in a subanaesthetic dose. Both techniques resulted in satisfactory sedation and recovery, although those who received propofol were more likely to recall their journey from the X-ray department back to the ward. Sedation in both groups resulted in unacceptable PaO2 values in some patients which could subsequently be corrected by administration of supplementary oxygen."
