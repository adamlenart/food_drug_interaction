On-line SPE was evaluated with one restricted access material (RAM), two large particle supports (LPS) and one monolith. A sample protein precipitation (PP) with acetonitrile (2:1) and a direct injection were tested. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to simplify data presentation and interpretation. Protein precipitation was found to be mandatory for reducing signal modification. Regarding sensitivity towards matrix effects after PP, atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) was globally the least sensitive ionization mode while electrospray ionization ESI was the most sensitive.",

We describe a manic patient who has an esophageal stricture and chronic pharyngitis, two conditions that impede the swallowing of medications. She was successfully treated for her mania with this orally disintegrating formulation. This case report shows that ODT olanzapine may be useful in the psychiatric management of manic and other patients for whom olanzapine is appropriate, and who have an underlying medical condition that impedes swallowing oral medications.", 
    "2": "In this paper we discuss therapy with ropinirole (known as adartrel in the United Kingdom) in patients with restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs, uncomfortable sensations in the legs and worsening of these symptoms during rest with at least temporary relief brought on by activity. Current recommendations suggest dopaminergic therapy (levodopa or dopamine receptor agonists like ropinirole) as the first-line treatment for restless legs syndrome. Based on the results of randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials, we conclude that ropinirole is effective in reducing symptoms of restless legs syndrome in the general population. Ropinirole has no serious or common side effects that would limit its use significantly. Rebound and augmentation problems are relatively rarely seen with ropinirole, although properly designed comparative trials are still needed to address this question. It must be noted, however, that most published studies with ropinirole compare this drug with placebo. Very few studies have compared ropinirole with other drugs (L-dopa, gabapentin, opioids, benzodiazepines, other dopaminergic agents and selegiline hydrochloride). No cost-effectiveness trial has been published yet. Treatment of restless legs syndrome with ropinirole shows it to be effective, well-tolerated and safe and it can be used in restless legs syndrome in general.", 
    "3": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors have been found throughout the body, and particularly, in high numbers, in neoplastic tissues such as the ovary, liver, colon, breast, prostate and brain cancer. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor expression has been associated with tumor malignity, and its subcellular localization is important to define its function in tumor cells. We investigated the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in Ehrlich tumor cells, and the in vitro effects of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors ligands on tumor cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in the nucleus of Ehrlich tumor cells (85.53+/-12.60%). They also show that diazepam and Ro5-4864 (peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor agonists) but not clonazepam (a molecule with low affinity for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor) decreased the percentage of tumor cells in G0-G1 phases and increased that of cells in S-G2-M phases. The effects of those agonists were prevented by PK11195 (a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) that did not produce effects by itself. Altogether, these data suggest that the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor within the nucleus of Ehrlich tumor cells is associated with tumor malignity and proliferation capacity.", 
    "4": "gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is believed to function as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain by binding to a GHB-specific binding site. In addition, GHB may also indirectly enhance the neuroinhibitory actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by converting to GABA at neuronal synapses. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of representative GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor agonists in rats treated chronically with GHB. Using a rotorod apparatus, the motor-impairing effects of GHB, the indirect GABA(A) receptor agonist, flunitrazepam, and the direct GABA(B) receptor agonist, baclofen, were examined before, during and after chronic treatment with 1000 mg/kg GHB, b.i.d. Prior to chronic treatment, all three drugs produced dose-dependent decreases in motor performance at low (8 rpm) and high (32 rpm) rotational speeds. Chronic treatment with GHB significantly decreased the potency of baclofen at both speeds, but did not alter the potency of either GHB or flunitrazepam. Following termination of chronic treatment, the potency of baclofen increased significantly at both speeds and returned to that observed prior to chronic treatment. These data indicate that chronic treatment with GHB confers tolerance to a GABA(B) receptor agonist under conditions in which tolerance is not conferred to a GABA(A) receptor agonist. These findings are consistent with the in vivo behavioral profile of GHB, which reveals a greater role for GABA(B) receptors than for GABA(A) receptors in its behavioral effects.",

The mismatch volume of interest (VOI) was defined as the initial PI lesion subtracted by the FLAIR lesion at day 7. An asymmetry ratio (AR) was computed by dividing the mean IMZ uptake of the mismatch VOI by the unaffected mirror VOI. The same AR was computed for signal intensity on FLAIR images at day 7. Three patients with cortical infarctions were included for calibration of the AR. In this group, the VOI consisted of the FLAIR lesion at day 7.",

    "9": "Extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors that are tonically activated by ambient GABA are important for controlling neuronal excitability. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, the subunit composition of these extrasynaptic receptors may include alpha5betagamma and/or alpha4betadelta subunits. Our present studies reveal that a component of the tonic current in the hippocampus is highly sensitive to inhibition by Zn(2+). This component is probably not mediated by either alpha5betagamma or alpha4betadelta receptors, but might be explained by the presence of alphabeta isoforms. Using patch-clamp recording from pyramidal neurons, a small tonic current measured in the absence of exogenous GABA exhibited both high and low sensitivity to Zn(2+) inhibition (IC(50) values, 1.89 and 223 microm, respectively). Using low nanomolar and micromolar GABA concentrations to replicate tonic currents, we identified two components that are mediated by benzodiazepine-sensitive and -insensitive receptors. The latter indicated that extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors exist that are devoid of gamma2 subunits. To distinguish whether the benzodiazepine-insensitive receptors were alphabeta or alphabetadelta isoforms, we used single-channel recording. Expressing recombinant alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha5beta3gamma2, alpha4beta3delta and alpha1beta3 receptors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) or mouse fibroblast (Ltk) cells, revealed similar openings with high main conductances (approximately 25-28 pS) for gamma2 or delta subunit-containing receptors whereas alphabeta receptors were characterized by a lower main conductance state (approximately 11 pS). Recording from pyramidal cell somata revealed a similar range of channel conductances, indicative of a mixture of GABA(A) receptors in the extrasynaptic membrane. The lowest conductance state (approximately 11 pS) was the most sensitive to Zn(2+) inhibition in accord with the presence of alphabeta receptors. This receptor type is estimated to account for up to 10% of all extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors on hippocampal pyramidal neurons.", 
    "10": "The stress-induced hyperthermia procedure, in which effects of drugs on basal (T(1)) and stress-induced body temperature (T(2)) are measured, predicts anxiolytic drug effect. Serotonergic drugs alter these responses and here, we studied the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors in stress-induced hyperthermia by using 5-HT(1A) receptor knockout mice. Three strains (129/Sv, Swiss Webster and C57Bl6) were used because genetic background can significantly modulate the null phenotype. We found that GABA-ergic drugs with an anxiolytic profile and stimulate alpha(2) subunit containing GABA(A) receptors, including diazepam and L838,417, result in reduced DeltaT (DeltaT=T(2)-T(1)). The alpha(1) subunit containing GABA(A) receptor was found to be primarily involved in regulation of basal body temperature T(1) and its stimulation can induce hypothermia. In addition, stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors by buspirone results in a reduced DeltaT, while stimulation of 5-HT(7) receptors primarily results in hypothermia. The null mutation of 5-HT(1A) receptors resulted in differences in drug-sensitivity that was further modulated by the genetic background. In particular, the null mutation on the SW and C57Bl6 backgrounds resulted in differential diazepam/L838,417 and 5-CT responses respectively. This indicates an interaction between the 5-HT(1A) receptor and genetic background and demonstrates the importance of selecting the background strain in a receptor knockout model.",

    "15": "The benzodiazepine tetrazepam is primarily muscle relaxant with comparably lower central sedating effects and is therefore commonly prescribed for muscle spasms of different origins. To evaluate tetrazepam metabolism, a study was conducted with ten healthy volunteers. Blood and urine samples were regularly collected after the intake of 50 mg tetrazepam. Toxicological analyses revealed that tetrazepam is also metabolized to diazepam and further to nordazepam, which has not yet been reported. Tetrazepam and diazepam could be detected in urine samples at least 72 h after intake, the diazepam concentration being 33% (+/-14% SD), on average, of the tetrazepam concentration. On the basis of three case histories, the importance of the detection of these newly described metabolites is shown as necessary to prevent false accusations and potential negative legal consequences for examined persons.",

As part of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, data on symptoms of depression, physician-diagnosed depression, prescribed medications, and death were collected prospectively in cohorts in Japan (n=1603) and 11 other countries (n=5872). Symptoms of depression were as prevalent in Japan as elsewhere, but in Japan a much smaller percentage of patients had physician-diagnosed depression: only 2% in Japan vs 17% elsewhere. Antidepressants were much less commonly prescribed in Japan: only 1% in Japan vs 17% elsewhere for patients with many and frequent symptoms of depression, and 16% in Japan vs 34% elsewhere for patients with physician-diagnosed depression. In Japan, symptoms of depression were associated with prescription of benzodiazepines (without antidepressants), and patients with physician-diagnosed depression were twice as likely to be given benzodiazepines: 32% in Japan vs 16% elsewhere. Benzodiazepine monotherapy was associated with death (relative risk 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-1.94), even after adjustments for 13 likely confounders (relative risk 1.27, 95% CI, 1.01-1.59).

    "22": "A placebo-controlled, double blind, between-within, counterbalanced design was employed. Two groups of male problem drinkers (n = 6/group) received a high (15-mg) or low (5-mg) dose of diazepam versus placebo on two identical test sessions. A lexical decision task assessed priming.", 
    "23": "Under placebo, significant NEG-->ALC priming emerged in each group. High-dose diazepam selectively reversed this effect, while low-dose selectively enhanced it. Correlations between NEG-->ALC priming and desire for alcohol provided further support that semantic priming of ALC concepts reflects a motivational process. The bi-directional effects found here parallel the effects of high- versus low-dose benzodiazepines on alcohol self-administration in animals.", 
    "24": "High-dose diazepam reduces prime-induced activation of ALC concepts in problem drinkers. Low-dose diazepam facilitates this process, and cross-priming of motivation for alcohol appears to explain this effect. Neurochemical modulation of the alcohol memory network may contribute to the motivational effects of benzodiazepines in problem drinkers.", 
    "25": "Literature data have provided evidence that antagonists of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and agonists of group II/III mGluRs show anxiolytic-like properties in preclinical studies. However data reporting anxiolytic-like action of group III mGlu receptor antagonists were also published. In the present paper we investigated the anxiolytic-like activity of the group III mGlu receptor antagonist (RS)-alpha-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG). To examine its anxiolytic-like effects, the basolateral amygdala was chosen as an injection site, as this brain region is involved in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior. To detect anxiolytic-like activity, the Vogel conflict-drinking test in rats was used. Intra-amygdalar injections of CPPG exhibited dose-dependent, potent anxiolytic-like action at a dose of 75 nmol, which was blocked by a concomitant administration of the group III mGlu receptor agonist CI (S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclo-pentane-1,3,4-tricarboxylic acid (ACPT-I) at a dose of 7.5 nmol. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (given intraperitoneally, 10 mg/kg) did not change the anxiolytic-like effect of CPPG, but that effect was abolished by the non-selective antagonist of 5-HT receptors metergoline and the antagonist of 5-HT2A/C receptors ritanserin (both given intraperitoneally at doses of 2 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively). These findings suggest that the blockade of group III mGlu receptors in the amygdala is responsible for anxiolysis and that serotonergic, but not the benzodiazepine recognition site of the GABA-ergic system are involved in the anxiolytic-like response induced by group III mGlu antagonist.", 
    "26": "Pregabalin is a new anxiolytic that has been recently licensed for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in Europe. Short-term efficacy is based on six positive placebo-controlled studies, all of which showed a significant early separation from placebo in all of the doses used (150-600 mg) at the first week, and the efficacy at the end of the treatment was comparable with the comparators used in four of these studies. Pregabalin was effective in more or less severe GAD, on psychic and somatic symptoms of GAD, and in treating the subsyndromal depressive symptoms of GAD. Efficacy in the elderly was shown in a separate placebo-controlled study. The effect on cognitive function was minimal and notably less than that observed with benzodiazepines. The discontinuation symptoms following abrupt treatment cessation were similar to the rates with serotonin-noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors and lower than with benzodiazepines with no signals of tolerance or dependence.", 
    "27": "Chronic maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with behavioral alterations that persist into adulthood. Moreover, adoption procedures performed immediately after birth can reverse these alterations. In this study, we examined the effects of prenatal restraint stress and adoption at birth (cross-fostering) on the behavioral response to an anxiety-provoking situation and on the adult male offspring expression of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors in selected brain areas. Adult offspring of rats stressed during the last week of pregnancy exhibited higher levels of anxiety than control rats. The anxiogenic behavior found at the elevated plus maze (EPM) has been related to the reduced levels of BDZ receptor levels in specific brain areas. Adult offspring of rats stressed during pregnancy exhibited a decrease in the number of BDZ receptors binding sites in the central amygdaloid nucleus (Ce), CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus when compared to controls. Regarding the adoption procedure, control pups raised by a foster gestationally stressed mother showed similar levels of anxiety as stressed groups. Stressed offspring raised by a foster control mother showed reduced anxiety levels compared to that of the control groups. Adoption per se showed no difference in time spent, neither in the open arms of the plus maze nor in BDZ receptor levels, when compared to the corresponding control and stressed groups. Stressed offspring raised by a foster control mother reverted BDZ receptor levels to control values. However, control pups raised by a gestationally stressed foster mother showed similar values compared to the control offspring in hippocampus, in spite of showing an anxiogenic behavior in the EPM. We found a significant increase of Ce BDZ receptor levels in control offspring raised by a foster stressed mother that could be explained as a compensatory effect to a GABA receptor desensitization. In summary, the behavioral outcome of the adult offspring is vulnerable both to the stress experience during the late prenatal period as well as to possible variations in care during lactation by mothers subjected to chronic stress during gestation. There seems to be a direct correlation between anxiety state and BDZ receptor levels in the adult offspring raised by their biological mothers. However, the mechanism of BDZ regulation leading to an anxious behavior might be different if the insult is received only postnatally as opposed to both pre and postnatally.", 
    "28": "We report the molecular cloning of the cDNA sequence for pig peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) by using RT-PCR and 5'/3' terminal extension. Three different transcripts (long, middle, and short) are identified. The open reading frame (ORF) of the longest PBR mRNA encodes a deduced polypeptide of 169 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 18,609 Da and an estimated pI of 9.70, which corresponds to the authentic PBR of other mammalian species. The middle transcript (PBR-M) contains a 141-codon ORF, which is consistent with that of the authentic PBR, but lacks a region of 84 bp so that its encoded polypeptide lacks a region of 28 amino acids from 35 to 62 of the authentic PBR polypeptide. The short transcript (PBR-S) contains a 104-codon ORF, which overlaps that of the authentic PBR, but lacks a region of 211 bp so that its encoded polypeptide lacks a region of 65 amino acids of the N-terminal of the authentic PBR. The pig PBR gene was mapped to the telomeric end of SSC5p. In addition, PBR mRNA was the more abundant detected form in pig tissues and in warm kidney that underwent ischemia suggesting functional implications of PBR during the renal repair process.", 
    "29": "Increasing evidence indicates that the GABAergic system in cerebellar and limbic structures is affected in autism. We extended our previous study that found reduced [(3)H]flunitrazepam-labeled benzodiazepine sites in the autistic hippocampus to determine whether this reduction was due to a decrease in binding site number (B (max)) or altered affinity (K (d)) to bind to the ligand. Quantitation of hippocampal lamina demonstrated a 20% reduction in B (max) indicating a trend toward a decreased number of benzodiazepine binding sites in the autistic group but normal K (d) values. A reduction in the number of hippocampal benzodiazepine binding sites suggests alterations in the modulation of GABA(A) receptors in the presence of GABA in the autistic brain, possibly resulting in altered inhibitory functioning of hippocampal circuitry.",

    "31": "Anesthetics bind to discrete selective binding sites on GABA(A) receptors--a discovery that challenges lipid-based theories of anesthesia. Not all GABA(A) receptors are equally sensitive to anesthetics because positive allosteric modulation is critically dependent on receptor subunit composition. Moreover, GABA(A) receptors located in extrasynaptic regions of hippocampal neurons display a greater sensitivity to propofol and benzodiazepines than do receptors located in subsynaptic regions. Enhancement in GABAergic inhibition may not account for all of the behavioral end-points associated with the anesthetic state. In particular, the immobilizing properties of anesthetics may not be solely mediated by GABA(A) receptors. Finally, synthetic neurosteroids are being developed as improved general anesthetics.",

    "33": "Standard cages prevent mice from performing several natural behaviours for which they are motivated. As a consequence, abnormal behaviours sometimes develop and mice often spend long periods inactive. To improve welfare, cages are sometimes furnished with items such as nesting material, shelters and running wheels. We have previously reported that when allowed to self-administer an anxiolytic, mice in furnished cages consume less anxiolytic than mice in standard cages. This paper presents the results of behaviour studies of the mice in the same experiment. Female C57BL/6J mice (3 per cage) were housed in Standard (n = 10), Unpredictable (n = 10) or Furnished (n = 6) cages. Unpredictable cages were identical to Standard cages, but were exposed to unpredictable events two to three times a week. Furnished cages were double the size of Standard cages and contained nesting material, nest box, tubes, chew blocks and a running wheel. During three consecutive periods, mice had access to only water (control), water or an anxiolytic solution on a daily alternating schedule (forced consumption), and finally, both water and anxiolytic (self-administration). Behaviour was analysed from video recordings taken during the dark phase. The housing type affected behaviour both under the control and the self-administration conditions. Overall, mice in Furnished cages spent less time resting and performing bar-related behaviours and more time on exploratory/locomotory behaviours. Mice in Furnished cages also performed less bar-circling stereotypies than mice in Standard cages. The Unpredictable treatment did not significantly affect behaviour compared to mice in the Standard conditions. There was an overall effect of anxiolytic availability on rest-related behaviours and on exploration-locomotion behaviours, in that mice rested more and spent less time on exploration and locomotion when they were able to self-administer the anxiolytic.", 
    "34": "We have previously reported on patterns of drug and alcohol use in fatally injured drivers in Washington State. Here we revisit that population to examine how drug use patterns have changed in the intervening 9 years. Blood and serum specimens from drivers who died within 4 h of a traffic accident between February 1, 2001, and January 31, 2002, were analyzed for illicit and therapeutic drugs and alcohol. Drugs when present were quantitated. Samples suitable for testing were obtained from 370 fatally injured drivers. Alcohol was detected above 0.01 g/100 mL in 41% of cases. The mean alcohol concentration for those cases was 0.17 g/100 mL (range 0.02-0.39 g/100 mL). Central nervous system (CNS) active drugs were detected in 144 (39%) cases. CNS depressants including carisoprodol, diazepam, hydrocodone, diphenhydramine, amitriptyline, and others were detected in 52 cases (14.1%), cannabinoids were detected in 47 cases (12.7%), CNS stimulants (cocaine and amphetamines) were detected in 36 cases (9.7%), and narcotic analgesics (excluding morphine which is often administered iatrogenically in trauma cases) were detected in 12 cases (3.2%). For those cases which tested positive for alcohol c. 40% had other drugs present which have the potential to cause or contribute to the driver's impairment. Our report also considers the blood drug concentrations in the context of their interpretability with respect to driving impairment. The data reveal that over the past decade, while alcohol use has declined, some drug use, notably methamphetamine, has increased significantly (from 1.89% to 4.86% of fatally injured drivers) between 1992 and 2002. Combined drug and alcohol use is a very significant pattern in this population and is probably overlooked in DUI enforcement programs.",

Low doses of trifluoperazine were superior to placebo in the treatment of GAD. Most of the less well-designed studies showed that other typical antipsychotics might be superior to placebo or as effective as benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD and other anxiety conditions. In most studies, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine augmentation to antidepressants was superior to placebo in treating refractory OCD and PTSD. Both olanzapine and quetiapine significantly reduced anxiety compared to placebo in studies of bipolar depression.",

Animals instrumented for electroencephalogram recording were pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (0.026 mg/kg i.m.) 30 min before challenge with 2 x LD50 (s.c.) of a nerve agent. In model A, atropine sulfate (2.0 mg/kg i.m.) and pyridine-2-aldoxime methylchloride (2-PAM; 25.0 mg/kg i.m.) were given 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the tested anticonvulsant was given (i.m.) 5 min after seizure onset. In model B, a lower dose of atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg i.m.) was given along with 2-PAM 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the anticonvulsant was given at seizure onset. With the lower dose of atropine, seizure occurrence increased to virtually 100% for all agents; the time to seizure onset decreased for sarin, cyclosarin, and VX; the signs of nerve agent intoxication were more severe; and coma resulted frequently with cyclosarin. The anticonvulsant ED50 doses for scopolamine or diazepam were, in general, not different between the two models, whereas the anticonvulsant ED50 values of midazolam increased 3- to 17-fold with the lower atropine dose. Seizure termination times were not systematically effected by the different doses of atropine. The order of anticonvulsant effectiveness within each model was scopolamine > or = midazolam > diazepam. The findings indicate that the dose of atropine given as antidotal therapy can significantly influence measures of nerve agent toxicity and responsiveness to anticonvulsant therapy.",

In each session, rats were exposed to 2 different 2-choice odor-discrimination problems with food reinforcement for correct responses. One problem (performance discrimination) remained the same throughout the study. That is, 1 odor was always correct (S+) and the other was never correct (S-). For the other problem (reversal discrimination), stimuli changed every session. Six different odors were used to program the reversal discrimination; on any given session, S+ was a stimulus that had served as S- the last time it had appeared, S- was a stimulus that had been S+ on its last appearance. Thus, in each session, learning a discrimination reversal could be studied along with the performance of a comparable, but previously learned, discrimination. Chlordiazepoxide interfered with reversal learning at doses that had no effect on the performance discrimination. Morphine and dizocilpine also impaired reversal learning but only at doses that also affected performance of the well-learned performance discrimination.",

Prolonged seizures, defined as a seizure lasting one minute or longer, were treated by placing buccal midazolam 5 mg (1 ml) between the lower lip and the gum. We administered a second dose of midazolam when the seizure lasted more than two minutes and a third dose of midazolam, or a combination of rectal diazepam 5 mg together with midazolam, as a rescue therapy when the seizure lasted for more than 3 minutes. Vital constants were monitored.",

We conducted a prospective, open study in schizophrenia patients in order to compare body weight and serum lipids during treatment with amisulpride, ziprasidone, clozapine or olanzapine over a period of 4 weeks. Body mass index, total cholesterol and triglycerides increased in patients treated with clozapine and olanzapine whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased in those patients. In patients treated with amisulpride or ziprasidone, we found a decrease in body mass index and total cholesterol whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased. Our results indicate that treatment with ziprasidone and amisulpride is more favourable than treatment with clozapine and olanzapine with respect to the risk to induce weight gain and hyperlipidaemia. These results are important with regard to the increased risk for cardiovascular complications in patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "74": "The imidazopyridine zolpidem (Ambien) is one of the most commonly prescribed sleep aids in the United States (Rush, 1998). Similar to classic benzodiazepines (BZDs), zolpidem binds at the extracellular N-terminal alpha/gamma subunit interface of the GABA-A receptor (GABAR). However, zolpidem differs significantly from classic BZDs in chemical structure and neuropharmacological properties. Thus, classic BZDs and zolpidem are likely to have different requirements for high-affinity binding to GABARs. To date, three residues--gamma2Met57, gamma2Phe77, and gamma2Met130--have been identified as necessary for high-affinity zolpidem binding (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:8824-8829, 1997; Mol Pharmacol 52:874-881, 1997). In this study, we used radioligand binding techniques, gamma2/alpha1 chimeric subunits (chi), site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modeling to identify additional gamma2 subunit residues important for high-affinity zolpidem binding. Whereas alpha1beta2chi receptors containing only the first 161 amino-terminal residues of the gamma2 subunit bind the classic BZD flunitrazepam with wild-type affinity, zolpidem affinity is decreased approximately 8-fold. By incrementally restoring gamma2 subunit sequence, we identified a seven-amino acid stretch in the gamma2 subunit loop F region (amino acids 186-192) that is required to confer high-affinity zolpidem binding to GABARs. When mapped to a homology model, these seven amino acids make up part of loop F located at the alpha/gamma interface. Based on in silico zolpidem docking, three residues within loop F, gamma2Glu189, gamma2Thr193, and gamma2Arg194, emerge as being important for stabilizing zolpidem in the BZD binding pocket and probably interact with other loop F residues to maintain the structural integrity of the BZD binding site.",

    "80": "Recent data have demonstrated that insular seizures can mimic those encountered in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), as well as nocturnal hypermotor attacks suggestive of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE). To illustrate some of the issues raised by these observations, we report our first two patients with suspected TLE and NFLE, respectively, in whom we originally demonstrated an insular ictal onset zone. Patient 1 suffered from daytime seizures characterised by a rising and distressing epigastric sensation rapidly followed by oro-alimentary automatisms, associated with right temporal scalp-EEG ictal discharge. Neuroimaging showed consistent right temporal abnormalities, including MRI signs of hippocampal sclerosis, anterior and mesial glucose hypometabolism, and mesial decrease of benzodiazepine receptors. Intra-cerebral EEG investigation was primarily performed because of several ictal signs and symptoms suggesting a rapid involvement of the perisylvian region, and showed that the patient suffered two types of seizure, one of which arose from the mesial temporal structures, the other was sleep-related and originated in the posterior-inferior portion of the insula. Anterior temporal lobectomy failed to control this second type of seizure. Patient 2 suffered from brief, nocturnal, hypermotor seizures characterised by an indefinable aura followed by agitation, body rolling, scream and pelvic thrust. Interictal and ictal scalp-EEG failed to detect epileptiform discharges, whereas neuroimaging showed left mesial frontal, glucose hypometabolism and decreased benzodiazepine receptors associated with a left fronto-basal arachnoidal cyst. Invasive EEG monitoring was performed with the aim of identifying an orbital or mesial frontal ictal onset, but eventually demonstrated that the seizure originated in the anterior-superior portion of the left insula. The patient did not undergo surgery and died of SUDEP two years later. We discuss the heterogeneity of insular seizure semiology according to functional anatomy, the clinical signs and symptoms that might suggest an insular ictal onset, the indications and types of invasive EEG monitoring that are needed to identify an insular epileptogenic zone definitively, as well as potential surgical treatment.",

Variables examined included: demographics, illness characteristics, baseline symptoms, symptom change, dose, adverse events, and functioning.", 
    "83": "Patients with a lower last dose relative to the preceding visit interval were 4 times more likely to relapse during that visit interval than other patients (p<.001). A similar finding was observed for a decrease in interval modal dose, although this variable was more predictive of relapse in the visit interval immediately following dose decrease (p=.027). In a subgroup analysis by gender, there was a significantly greater incidence of relapse in men with a dose decrease, whereas a dose decrease in women did not correlate with relapse. Relapse was also correlated with the emergence or worsening of a psychiatric adverse event during the same (p<.001) and preceding (p=.007) visit intervals, and with increased rating scale measures of psychopathology. The occurrence of a non-psychiatric adverse event was not associated with relapse.",

Claims data for 7017 treatment episodes of commercially insured patients with schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM) receiving antipsychotics, covering the period from January 1999 through August 2003, were assessed. Overall adherence was evaluated by adherence intensity (medication possession ratio) and treatment duration (length of treatment episode). Pair-wise comparisons of the individual atypicals and a combined group of leading typical antipsychotics were undertaken using multiple regression, adjusting for differing patient characteristics. Each atypical antipsychotic demonstrated a significantly higher adherence intensity than the combined typicals, while quetiapine demonstrated a significantly greater adherence intensity than risperidone and olanzapine. None of the atypicals showed treatment durations significantly different from the typicals. While the small improvements in adherence intensity among atypical agents do not appear to be clinically important, they may reflect an underlying, stronger tendency to use filled prescriptions.",

    "93": "We report on three acute encephalitis patients with refractory, repetitive partial seizures (AERRPS). All three suffered acute febrile episodes associated with status epilepticus, which necessitated high-dose barbiturate therapy under artificial ventilation for several weeks. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed a predominance of diffuse epileptiform discharges initially, subsequently developing into periodic bursts of these discharges. Reduction of the barbiturate dosage resulted in clinical and subclinical partial seizures appearing repetitively in clusters. Prolonged fever persisted for 2-3 months, even several weeks after normalization of cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. The EEG showed an improvement after resolution of this fever, and seizures became less frequent, although still intractable. Oral administration of high-dose barbiturate and benzodiazepines were partially effective during the acute phase, and a barbiturate dependency, lasting for years, was noted in one patient. Steroid administration was effective in stopping the febrile episodes in one patient, with concurrent improvement in seizure control. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enhancement of bitemporal cortical areas in one patient, and high signal intensity on T2 weighted image in the bilateral claustrum in another patient. Diffuse cortical atrophy appeared within two months after the onset of encephalitis in all patients. The evolution of the seizures and EEG findings suggested a high degree of cortical excitability in AERRPS. In this report, we propose a tentative therapeutic regimen for seizure control in this condition. We also hypothesize that a prolonged inflammatory process exists in the cerebral cortex with AERRPS, and may be pivotal in the epileptogenesis.",

Silicone bolus was injected into the fourth ventricle to minimize drug distribution to the spinal cord. 60 min later, 50-min infusion of pentobarbital (6.0 mg/h), fentanyl (0.75 microg/h), propofol (3.0 mg/h), or midazolam (0.24 mg/h) was initiated. Vibrissal, olfactory, corneal, and tail-pinch responses were tested every 10 min.",

All agents except propofol depressed tail-pinch response; fentanyl and pentobarbital produced the strongest effect. All agents except midazolam increased delta power. Pentobarbital enhanced theta power. All agents except fentanyl enhanced alpha and beta power. Pentobarbital and midazolam slightly increased, whereas fentanyl decreased, gamma power. Pentobarbital increased and midazolam decreased somatosensory evoked potential; these changes were small and apparently unrelated to behavior.",

This abnormality persisted for a long time after the correction of the dilutional and consumption coagulopathy which followed immediately the burn. Blood analysis found fluindione and benzodiazepine derivatives. Such a disorder during a potentially suicidal burn must evoke a toxic aetiology.", 
    "119": "Moxidectin is a macrocyclic lactone related to ivermectin used in horses and dogs for endoparasite treatment and prophylaxis. The clinical and neurological presentation of moxidectin toxicity in two dogs following inadvertent poisoning with a moxidectin-containing equine de-worming medication is reported here. In both the dogs, the predominant clinical signs were generalised tremors and ataxia. Moxidectin exerts its neurotoxic effects in mammals by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid and, consistent with this, both the dogs demonstrated a poor response to treatment with diazepam. It would be more appropriate to avoid gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, in dogs with moxidectin toxicity and consider using anaesthetic agents with a different mode of action, such as propofol. The prognosis in dogs accidentally exposed to moxidectin-containing equine de-worming medication appears to be excellent if the cause of the neurotoxicity is correctly identified and the case is appropriately managed.",

    "121": "We sought to evaluate our experience with glucagon used in the emergency department setting to relieve esophageal food impaction (EFI). We reviewed the records of patients with food impaction who received glucagon between January 1998 and May 2003 and recorded patient demographics, medical history, symptoms following glucagon administration, and endoscopic findings. There were 92 episodes of food impaction in 85 patients. Thirty-three percent of the episodes resulted in resolution of symptoms following a dose of glucagon. Sixty-seven percent had symptoms of food impaction after glucagon and underwent upper endoscopy in the emergency room. Only previous solid food dysphagia was positively associated with response to glucagon. Patients who received glucagon plus a benzodiazepine were more likely to have resolution of the EFI. In our experience, glucagon appears to relieve food impaction in one third of patients treated. This result is comparable to previously published data examining glucagon and placebo. The lack of advantage over placebo questions the practice of glucagon administration for EFI.", 
    "122": "Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been widely used in psychology and sociology for testing validity of measurement instruments. However, this statistical technique has so far played minor role in quality-of-life research. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of SEM for constructing and testing the validity of a Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics (SWN) index for patients with schizophrenia. For these purposes, data from the GEO study (Gesundheits\u00f6konomische Evaluation von Olanzapin in Deutschland; Health economics study of olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in Germany) were used. The GEO is a prospective, comparative, noninterventional, observational study. A total of 646 participants treated with either olanzapine (n = 416) or haloperidol (n = 230) were enrolled in the study; 360 patients were available for factor analyses. The short (20-item) form of the SWN scale was administered to assess patients' perspectives on their quality of life. The structural equation models (SEMs) were then applied to construct 5- and 10-item indexes based on SWN. The data indicate that the 5-item index is the most time-saving approach for evaluating perceptions of well-being (and thus, quality of life) among patients with schizophrenia. The application of SEM showed no appreciable loss of validity of this index.", 
    "123": "It has been proposed that a titration of the mandibular positioner would be a promising method for predicting the outcome of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that mandible advancement could be evaluated by analysis of inspiratory flow limitation using a titration procedure. To explore its effect, we examined upper airway pressure-flow relationships using a titrated mandible positioner during midazolam sedation. Non-flow limited inspiration occurred when the mandible was advanced 7.1 +/- 1.2 mm from centric occlusion position. In the centric occlusion position (0 mm advancement), Pcrit was -1.9 +/- 2.9 cmH2O and Rua was 23.3 +/- 4.5 cmH2O L(-1) s(-1). In the eMAP position, Pcrit was -7.3 +/- 1.9 cmH2O and Rua was 27.8 +/- 3.3 cmH2O L(-1) s(-1). Essentially no CPAP was required to overcome flow limitation in eMAP position, whereas 3.7 +/- 2.2 cmH2O CPAP was required in centric occlusion position. We conclude that assessing inspiratory flow limitation using a titrated mandible positioner was effective for estimating individual-matched mandible positions.",

Cerebellar manifestations either preceded SPS or occurred concurrently. Brain MRI was normal. The intrathecal production of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies was elevated. Gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing drugs and immunotherapies improved only the stiffness. SPS-Cer is a distinct subset of SPS causing a more severe and complex clinical phenotype.", 
    "125": "Spontaneous or evoked electrical brain activity is increasingly used to monitor general anesthesia. Previous studies investigated the variables from spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), acoustic (AEP), or somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). But, by monitoring them separately, the available information from simultaneous gathering could be missed. We investigated whether the combination of simultaneous information from EEG, AEP, and SSEP shows a more discriminant power to differentiate between anesthesia states than from information derived from each measurement alone. Therefore, we assessed changes of 30 EEG, 21 SSEP, and 29 AEP variables recorded from 59 patients during four clinical states of general anesthesia: \"awake,\" \"light anesthesia,\" \"surgical anesthesia,\" and \"deep surgical anesthesia.\" The single and combined discriminant powers of EEG, AEP, and SSEP variables as predictors of these states were investigated by discriminant analysis. EEG variables showed a higher discriminant power than AEP or SSEP variables: 85%, 46%, and 32% correctly classified cases, respectively. The frequency of correctly classified cases increased to 90% and 91% with information from EEG + AEP and EEG + AEP + SSEP, respectively. Thus, future anesthesia monitoring should consider combined information simultaneously distributed on different electrophysiological measurements, rather than single variables or their combination from EEG or AEP or SSEP.", 
    "126": "Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is suggested to be intimately involved in the progression of malignancies. Our previous research has demonstrated that activation of cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R) by gastrin stimulates a rapid activation of FAK pathway in human colon cancer cells. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of CCK2R and FAK in the progression of colon cancer. In this study, matched tissue samples of primary colon cancer and adjacent normal colon mucosa from the same patient were collected from 45 patients with colon cancer undergoing surgical resection. The gastrin expression was detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The CCK2R expression was examined by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. The expression of FAK and phosphorylated FAK at tyrosine 397 (phospho-FAK) were detected using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Colo320 and SW787, 2 colon cancer cell lines with or without CCK2R expression, were recruited in this study. Antisense oligonucleotide of FAK was used to block the expression of FAK. Invasiveness and motility of colon cancer cells were detected by Boyden chamber. In this series, enhanced expression of gastrin, CCK2R, FAK and phospho-FAK were observed in colon cancer tissues. CCK2R expression correlated with expression of phospho-FAK. Coexpression of CCK2R and phospho-FAK associated with invasion and lymph node metastasis. Increased invasion and motility was induced by gastrin in Colo320 cells. Overexpression of CCK2R by stable transfection of CCK2R plasmid amplified this increase and incubation with 1 microM L-365,260, a specific CCK2R antagonist, completely inhibited the effect of gastrin. FAK antisense largely blocked the increase of invasion and motility in Colo320 cells. Our data represent the evidence for the CCK2R regulating invasion and motility of colon cancer cells, and support a role of CCK2R in the progression of colon cancer. FAK play a critical role in this CCK2R-mediated effect.",

We compare the model results with ictal electrocortical data recorded from three human subjects and show how the two agree. We determine that, in the model system, seizures result from increased connectivity between excitatory and inhibitory cell populations, or from decreased connectivity within either excitatory or inhibitory cell populations. We compare the model results with the disinhibition and 4-AP models of epilepsy and suggest how the model may guide the development of new anticonvulsant therapies.",

Bipolar maintenance trials are organized according to the features of their designs, such as use of responder-enriched samples; inclusion following an index manic versus an index depressive episode; outcome defined as relapse into mania, depression, or either; and use of survival analysis. Pivotal studies of lithium, divalproex, lamotrigine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and other medications are reviewed. The directional efficacy of the different medications as maintenance treatment is discussed, with treatments differentiated in terms of whether they primarily prolong time to mania or to depression or have bidirectional effects. Also discussed are findings concerning the continuation of acute treatments, including antidepressants, into the maintenance phase; dosage adjustments for maintenance treatment; the rationale for combination treatments; and implications of comorbid substance abuse and strategies for its management. Directions for future research are suggested.", 
    "129": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine the amount of anxiety patients believed tolerable and the amount of anxiety experienced during routine burn wound care. Participants included 47 hospitalized adults who provided data for four consecutive assessment periods. Patients (mean TBSA, 16%; range, 2-70%) were primarily Caucasian (87%) and had an average hospital stays of 23 days (range, 11-130). Reports of what level of anxiety they would be able to tolerate and what level of anxiety had been experienced were assessed using 10-point Graphic Rating Scales. The use of anxiolytic was recorded, and patient suggestions for reducing anxiety were obtained. The single most commonly endorsed anxiety treatment goal was 0, although 53% consistently chose a treatment goal other than 0 (range, 1-6). Two repeated-measure analyses of variance indicated that the amount of anxiety patients could tolerate and the amount they reported experiencing did not change over the course of time. Paired t-tests revealed that patients routinely reported more anxiety than they considered tolerable. Analyses of anxiety reports of patients treated with anxiolytics (n = 6) vs patients receiving no anxiolytics (n = 41) revealed inconsistent differences in actual anxiety and treatment goals across time. In general, patient suggestions for lessening anxiety included requests for education, communication, additional medications, and manipulation of the hospital environment. Anxiety for burn-injured, hospitalized adults remains a concern. Our findings are consistent with the literature indicating that adult patients hospitalized for burn wound care report appreciable anxiety, over and above what they consider \"tolerable.\" Continued research is needed and should include investigations into the relationship between pain and anxiety during routine wound care.", 
    "130": "Variable interindividual expression of cytochrome P450 3A presents a challenge in dosing drugs. The use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A such as ketoconazole has been explored to reduce the clearance of CYP3A substrates, thereby resulting in smaller dose requirements; however, the impact of CYP3A inhibition on interindividual variability has not been well characterized. Our objective was to examine the effect of ketoconazole inhibition on CYP3A metabolic variability as measured by the CYP3A biomarker oral midazolam. A single dose of midazolam (0.075 mg/kg) was administered to 19 healthy Caucasian adults (38.7 +/- 8.8 years, nine male/10 female) at baseline and concurrently with ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 10 days) on day 6 or 9 of ketoconazole. Plasma samples were collected over 6 to 30 h. A paired t test and percent coefficient of variation (CV%) were used to evaluate differences in midazolam clearance and interindividual variability during both phases. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine probability distribution of area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs). Midazolam apparent oral clearance decreased by 89% (p < 0.0001) during inhibition. Cmax increased from 23 ng/ml (95% CI 19-29 ng/ml) to 55 ng/ml (95% CI 46-66 ng/ml), p < 0.0001. CV% increased from 41 to 58% from baseline to ketoconazole inhibition. AUCs [median (range)] were 0.20 mg . min/ml (0.05-0.81 mg . min/ml) and 1.94 mg . min/ml (0.25-25.4 mg . min/ml) at baseline and inhibition phase, with CV% of 41 and 61%, respectively. Ketoconazole decreased CYP3A activity but did not reduce interindividual variability. Use of a CYP3A inhibitor to standardize dosing of CYP3A substrates may not be feasible in clinical practice.", 
    "131": "Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission is primarily mediated by synaptically released gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting on postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors. GABA acting on GABA(A) receptors produces not only phasic but also tonic inhibitions by persistent activation of extrasynaptic receptors. However, the mechanistic characteristics of tonic inhibition in the neocortex are not well-understood. To address this, we studied pharmacologically isolated GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents in neocortical pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. Bath application of bicuculline blocked miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and produced an outward shift in baseline holding current (I(hold)). Low concentrations of SR95531, a competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonist, abolished mIPSCs but had no significant effect on I(hold). The benzodiazepine midazolam produced an inward shift in I(hold) by augmenting tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents, which were significantly greater in layer V neurons than in layer II/III. Single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed a relatively higher expressions of alpha1 and alpha5 subunit mRNA in layer V neurons. L-655708, an alpha5 subunit-specific inverse agonist, reduced tonic currents in layer V but not in layer II/III neurons, whereas zolpidem, an alpha1-subunit agonist, exerted equivalent effects in both layers. These data suggest that the alpha1 GABA(A) receptor subunit is generally involved in tonic inhibition in pyramidal neurons of the neocortex, whereas the alpha5 subunit is specifically involved in layer V neurons.",

It is unknown if these agents also alter pregnenolone or deoxycorticosterone. Since olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination have clinical utility and may demonstrate synergistic effects, we investigated neuroactive steroid alterations following olanzapine, fluoxetine or coadministration. Male rats received IP vehicle, olanzapine, fluoxetine or the combination of both agents in higher-dose (0, 10, 20 or 10/20 mg/kg, respectively) and lower-dose (0, 5, 10 or 5/10 mg/kg, respectively) experiments. Pregnenolone and allopregnanolone levels in hippocampus were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Peripheral deoxycorticosterone and other steroid levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Olanzapine, fluoxetine or the combination increased hippocampal pregnenolone and serum deoxycorticosterone in both higher- and lower-dose experiments, and elevated hippocampal allopregnanolone in higher-dose conditions. No synergistic effects on pregnenolone or allopregnanolone were observed following olanzapine and fluoxetine coadministration compared to either compound alone. Pregnenolone and its sulfate enhance learning and memory in rodent models, and therefore pregnenolone elevations may be relevant to cognitive changes in psychotic and affective disorders. Since pregnenolone decreases have been linked to depression, it is possible that olanzapine- and fluoxetine-induced pregnenolone elevations may contribute to the antidepressant actions of these agents.",

    "153": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most prominent and abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian brain where it interacts with a family of G-protein coupled receptors, including the Y(1) receptor subtype (Y(1)R). NPY-Y(1)R signalling plays a prominent role in the regulation of several behavioural and physiological functions including feeding behaviour and energy balance, sexual hormone secretion, stress response, emotional behaviour, neuronal excitability and ethanol drinking. Y(1)R expression is regulated by neuronal activity and peripheral hormones. The Y(1)R gene has been isolated from rodents and humans and it contains multiple regulatory elements that may participate in the regulation of its expression. Y(1)R expression in the hypothalamus is modulated by changes in energetic balance induced by a wide variety of conditions (fasting, pregnancy, hyperglycaemic challenge, hypophagia, diet induced obesity). Estrogens up-regulate responsiveness to NPY to stimulate preovulatory GnRH and gonadotropin surges by increasing Y(1)R gene expression both in the hypothalamus and the pituitary. Y(1)R expression is modulated by different kinds of brain insults, such as stress and seizure activity, and alteration in its expression may contribute to antidepressant action. Chronic modulation of GABA(A) receptor function by benzodiazepines or neuroactive steroids also affects Y(1)R expression in the amygdala, suggesting that a functional interaction between the GABA(A) receptor and Y(1)R mediated signalling may contribute to the regulation of emotional behaviour. In this paper, we review the state of the art concerning Y(1)R function and gene expression, including our personal contribution to many of the subjects mentioned above.",

Young and middle-aged animals demonstrated behavioral tolerance to lorazepam, while the aged animals showed a similar trend which failed to reach significance. In addition, aged animals also showed a trend toward tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of lorazepam. There were no changes in alpha1 mRNA levels in cortex or hippocampus following administration of lorazepam when compared to vehicle-treated animals in any age group. Aged animals, however, had an initial increase in alpha1 mRNA expression in cortex and hippocampus on day 1 of vehicle treatment followed by decreased expression on day 14. These age-related changes were abolished by lorazepam administration. In summary, age-related sensitivity to the effects of lorazepam was not demonstrated in the present study. However, comparison of these data to other studies indicates that the effect of chronic benzodiazepine treatment may be specific to the benzodiazepine administered, the technique used to quantify mRNA expression changes, the subunits of the GABA(A) receptor investigated and the brain region analyzed. The phenomenon of benzodiazepine sensitivity in the elderly is an area of research which remains controversial and may well be compound specific. Determining benzodiazepines that do not produce pharmacodynamic sensitivity, such as lorazepam, may allow more careful prescribing and dosing of these drugs, and perhaps even the development of specific agents which could avoid this sensitivity.",

The mean midazolam use was 1.13 mg i.v., and the mean fentanyl requirement was 60.0 microg i.v. in the block patients. Two episodes of hypotension, which responded promptly to volume replacement, may have been related to the block. No serious complications were encountered. The mean pain score when traversing the chest wall, liver capsule, and upon entering the bile ducts was 0.1 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 1 patient reporting a pain level of 1 and 9 reporting 0. The mean peak pain score, encountered when manipulating at the common bile duct level or when addressing stones there, was 5.4 and ranged from 0 to 10.",

    "159": "The purpose of this study was to estimate pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single doses of an extended release formulation of alprazolam (Xanax XR) in adolescent and adult healthy volunteers. This was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-period crossover study. Twelve adolescent healthy volunteers (13-17 years) and 12 adult healthy volunteers (20-45 years) received single doses of Xanax XR 1 mg or 3 mg tablets. Blood samples were obtained predose and for 48 hours postdose. Plasma samples were assayed for alprazolam and its two active metabolites alpha-hydroxy-alprazolam and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Safety assessments included clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse event monitoring. At both dose levels, mean plasma concentration-time profiles of alprazolam, alpha-hydroxy-alprazolam, and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam were similar in adolescent and adult subjects. The ratios of estimated geometric means for AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax between adolescents and adults for both dose levels were 115% (95% CI: [93, 143]) and 111% (95% CI: [95, 129]), respectively. An assessment of dose proportionality between the 3 mg and 1 mg alprazolam doses within both age groups indicated that the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax were both within 80-125% equivalence limits. Parent-metabolite ratios were similar in both age groups and were consistent with those previously reported. Alprazolam was well tolerated by both age groups. The most common adverse event was somnolence, which occurred in a dose-related manner. Based on the similar pharmacokinetic profiles, dosing of Xanax XR should be similar in adolescents and adults.",

They develop by a periodical interplay of Ca2+, which enters the neuron from the extracellular medium and triggers Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ca2+ -oscillations are terminated by reuptake into the ER or plasmalemmal extrusion. Spontaneous Ca2+ -oscillations are glutamate dependent and appear to be responsible for neuronal plasticity and integration of information. Here, we examined the role of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor on spontaneous Ca2+ -oscillations and studied the effects of the anaesthetics midazolam, thiopental and the non-anesthetic barbituric acid on spontaneous Ca2+ -oscillations.",

Pain and discomfort scores were better in group R than in group P. Sedation levels were higher in group P than in group R. Group P needed more supplemental doses than group R. The time to reach an Aldrete score of nine or more was shorter in group R, but discharge times were similar in the two groups. Amnesia was better in group P. Nausea and vomiting were more frequent in group R during the recovery phase.",

After determining the objectives for management and the search strategy for primary and secondary RLS and for PLMD, a review of the scientific literature up to 2004 was performed for the drug classes and interventions employed in treatment (drugs acting on the adrenoreceptor, antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines/hypnotics, dopaminergic agents, opioids, other treatments). Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations formed according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating. Dopaminergic agents came out as having the best evidence for efficacy in primary RLS. Reported adverse events were usually mild and reversible; augmentation was a feature with dopaminergic agents. No controlled trials were available for RLS in children and for RLS during pregnancy. The following level A recommendations can be offered: for primary RLS, cabergoline, gabapentin, pergolide, ropinirole, levodopa and rotigotine by transdermal delivery (the latter two for short-term use) are effective in relieving the symptoms. Transdermal oestradiol is ineffective for PLMD.", 
    "173": "Once considered simply as the main source of ATP, mitochondria are now implicated in the control of many additional aspects of cell physiology, such as calcium signaling, and pathology, as in injury incurred on ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (I/R). Mitochondrial respiration is ordinarily accompanied by low-level ROS production, but they can respond to elevated ROS concentrations by increasing their own ROS production, a phenomenon termed ROS-induced ROS release (RIRR). Two modes of RIRR have been described. In the first mode of RIRR, enhanced ROS leads to mitochondrial depolarization via activation of the MPTP, yielding a short-lived burst of ROS originating from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). The second mode of RIRR is MPTP independent but is regulated by the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR). Increased ROS in the mitochondrion triggers opening of the inner mitochondrial membrane anion channel (IMAC), resulting in a brief increase in ETC-derived ROS. Both modes of RIRR have been shown to transmit localized mitochondrial perturbations throughout the cardiac cell in the form of oscillations or waves but are kinetically distinct and may involve different ROS that serve as second messengers. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of these different modes of RIRR.",

Unexpectedly, in the survey data, we observed trends suggesting regional variation both in the frequency and pattern of use. Examination of prescription dispensing data confirmed this pattern. Clinical factors, including the use of other psychotropic medications and psychiatric diagnoses, were strongly associated with BDZ-SSH use. Among the drugs examined, zopiclone had the highest frequency of use. Prescription dispensing data confirmed that the frequency of zopiclone use in Alberta is higher than that in most other provinces.",

The patient is his or her own control, and receives the experimental and the control treatment during several periods of time in random order. Reports of N-of-1 trials are still relatively scarce, and the research methodology is not as firmly established as that of RCTs. Recently, we have conducted two series of N-of-1 trials in general practice. Before, during, and after data-collection, difficulties regarding outcome assessment, analysis of the results, the withdrawal of patients, and the follow-up had to be dealt with. These difficulties are described and our solutions are discussed.",

It is recommended to use the same dosages and dosage forms that the patient used before the trial, to start the trial with a run-in period, to formulate both general and individualized decision rules regarding the efficacy of treatment, to adjust treatment policies immediately after the trial, and to provide adequate instructions and support if treatment is adjusted.",

However, when the design of each N-of-1 trial is tailored to the specific characteristics of each individual patient and the underlying medical problem, most difficulties in N-of-1 trials can be prevented or overcome. In this way, N-of-1 trials may be of help when deciding on drug treatment for individual patients.",

This study used radioligand binding assays to compare the binding affinities of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol for candidate receptors potentially involved in AP-induced weight gain. Selected candidates derived from known pathways involved in body weight regulation included receptors classified as anorexigenic (bombesin receptor subtype 3, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, cholecystokinin receptor, melanocortin-4 receptor, neurotensin receptor 1) or orexigenic (cannabinoid receptor 1, galanin 1 receptor, melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR), neuropeptide Y1 receptor) as well as receptors involved in physiological actions related to digestion and fluid homeostasis (angiotensin II type 1 receptor, bradykinin B2 receptor, endothelin receptor, neurokinin 1 receptor, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1). Clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol exhibited negligible affinities to all of these receptors except for the MCHR (Ki=501 nM; haloperidol). With respect to other candidates from (neuro)transmitter systems already suggested to be involved in AP-induced weight gain, the binding profile of olanzapine resembled that of clozapine, with high affinity (Ki<10 nM) for serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT6, muscarinic M1 and histamine H1 receptors. In contrast, the binding profile of haloperidol was substantially different (high affinity only for the dopamine D1 receptor). In conclusion, we have not identified a novel binding site of the two investigated atypical AP that could contribute to the induced weight gain.",
