Physical examination findings (generalized tremors, agitation, mydriasis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension) were consistent with overstimulation of the CNS and excessive adrenergic activity resulting from methylphenidate toxicosis. Plasma methylphenidate concentration at admission (83 ng/ml) was 5 to 16 times greater than the concentration reported to provide therapeutic effect in human beings. The cat was placed in a dark, padded cage to minimize external stimuli, and supportive care consisting of fluids and diazepam were administered. Clinical signs resolved within 25 hours after ingestion of methylphenidate.", 
    "1": "Breast reduction is a surgical procedure most commonly performed on an inpatient basis under general anesthesia. In the current climate of health care reform, we must evaluate such procedures to determine if there are alternate, less expensive, but equally safe means to perform them. Our purpose is to present our experience with 50 bilateral breast reductions performed under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation between October of 1991 and October of 1994. We have excluded bilateral reductions under 500 gm total, unilateral reductions, mastopexies, and gynecomastia procedures. Patients were sedated with intravenous Versed and fentanyl and a local solution consisting of marcaine, lidocaine, and 1:2000,000 epinephrine. Intercostal blocks were not used routinely. Monitoring and sedation were performed by nonanesthesia personnel in 49 patients. There were no complications relating to the sedation or to the local solution. All reductions were performed by the inferior pedicle technique. The average patient age was 28.0 years (20 to 67 years). The total breast tissue resected was 1372 gm (516 to 2948 gm), with 33 patients having resections greater than 1000 gm. Operative times averaged 3 hours (115 to 275 minutes). Forty-nine of the 50 patients tolerated the procedure with little or no recall. Twenty-eight patients were discharged on the same day as admission. One patient recalled some significant discomfort during parts of the procedure. All stated that they would again have the procedure performed under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) Breast reduction can be performed safely and comfortably under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation. (2) Patients should be chosen on their acceptability as intravenous sedation candidates and not with regard to the amount of breast tissue removed. (3) There will be a subset of patients who can be discharged on the same day.", 
    "2": "In a crossover study of seven term neonates who had neuroimaging studies, chloral hydrate (75 mg/kg administered orally) was more efficacious (p<0.05) but similar with regard to toxic effects than midazolam (0.2 mg/kg administered intravenously). Thus newer drugs are not necessarily better, and monitoring is essential even after a single oral sedative dose.", 
    "3": "The concept of selective vulnerability or selective loss o f individual neurons, with survival of glial and vascular elements as one of the consequences of a systemic ischemic-hypoxic insult (eg, transient cardiac arrest or severe hypotension), has been recognized for decades. In contrast, selective neuronal death as one of the lesions that may develop in the brain after occluding an intracranial artery is an idea not readily acknowledged in the current medical literature dealing with human stroke.", 
    "4": "A review of pertinent publications reveals that selective neuronal injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion was observed in autopsy specimens over 40 years ago, although its pathogenesis remains unclear. Recent observations in both humans and animals suggest that selective neuronal necrosis (rather than infarct) is the consequence of either a short-term arterial occlusion or permanent occlusion accompanied by ischemia of moderate severity. During the acute and subacute states of an ischemic stroke, the loss of a limited number of neurons (ie, incomplete infarction) does not result in structural changes discernible by either CT or conventional MRI. However, the loss of a selected number of neurons may be demonstrable in vivo by calculating the corresponding loss of benzodiazepine receptors. The use of specific radiotracers in combination with single-photon emission CT or positron emission tomography allows demonstration of a decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic receptor sites at places where many neurons have been lethally injured.", 
    "5": "We aim to alert physicians to the potential development of incomplete brain infarctions in patients with intracranial arterial occlusions. Recognizing incomplete infarcts is particularly important in the context of stroke therapy with thrombolytic and neuroprotective agents. This brain lesion is likely to be the consequence of an arterial occlusion with a resultant ischemia of moderate severity (eg, regional blood flows in the range of 15 to 20 mL x 100 g-1 x min-1).", 
    "6": "The ability of benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists to exhibit full efficacy in preclinical anxiolytic tests, in conjunction with initial clinical results, has suggested the possibility of a reduced clinical side-effect profile compared to benzodiazepine receptor full agonists like diazepam. Because punished behavior of pigeons has been useful in detecting effects of novel anxiolytic drugs, effects of imidazobenzodiazepine and beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists and some related compounds were evaluated in this species. The abilities of these compounds to substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of the full agonists midazolam also was determined. Intrinsic efficacy was assessed by the degree to which gamma-aminobutyric acid increased ligand potency to displace [(3)H]Ro15-1788 (flumazinil) from membranes of pigeon cerebrum, and ranged from full agonist-like efficacy (Ro 19-5470; 7-(3-cyclopropyl-1,2,4-oxodiazol-5-yl)-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-4H- imidazo[1,5a]-thieno[3,2-f]diazin-4-one) to minimal gamma-aminobutyric acid potentiations close to that of the antagonist flumazenil (abecarnil and Ro 41-7812; 7-chloro-4,5-dihydro-3-(3-hydroxy-1-propynyl)-5-methyl-6H-imidazo[1,5-a] -[1,4 ]benzodiazepine-6-one). Punished responding was increased markedly by midazolam and by all partial agonists, except Ro 41-7812 and Ro 42-8773 (7-chloro-3-[3-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-1-propynyl]-4,5-dihyro-5 -methyl-6H-imidaz o[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one), at doses that did not affect nonpunished responding. In contrast to the full substitution generally observed in mammals, all of the partial agonists produced incomplete substitution (40-70%) in the midazolam drug discrimination procedure in pigeons. A positive relationship was observed between the degree of substitution and intrinsic efficacy. The benzodiazepine antagonists, flumazenil and ZK 93,426 (ethyl-5-isopropoxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), neither increased punished responding nor substituted for midazolam. The results of the present study suggest that benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists and related compounds may provide full anxiolytic activity at doses that do not fully reproduce the subjective effect profile of full agonists.", 
    "7": "Flumazenil competitively blocks the pharmacological effects of both positive and negative allosteric modulators acting at the benzodiazepine binding sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, label-fracture immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we determined changes in the contents of selected GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA(s), in their translation products and in the electrophysiological characteristics of the receptor channels in cultured cerebellar granule cells treated daily with flumazenil (10 microM) for 4 days in vitro. The contents of the alpha1 and alpha6 receptor subunit mRNAs were significantly increased in the flumazenil-treated group as compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle-treated control group, whereas there were no significant differences in the absolute amounts of the beta2, beta3, gamma2S, gamma2L++ + and delta receptor subunit mRNAs. The gold immunolabeling densities of the alpha1 and delta receptor subunits were significantly increased, whereas those of the alpha6, beta2/beta3 and gamma2 receptor subunits were decreased. Double-immunolabeling experiments using 5- and 10-nm gold particles suggest that after chronic flumazenil treatment, receptor subunit assemblies containing the alpha1/gamma2 and alpha6/delta subunits may be replaced by a receptor assembly containing the alpha1/delta subunits. The GABA potency in eliciting Cl- channel activity decreased significantly, as indicated by the elevated EC50 values, and the positive modulation of GABA action by diazepam also decreased. These results suggest that flumazenil, perhaps by blocking the action of endogenous allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors, may trigger a change in the expression and assembly of the subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. This implies that there might be a dynamic state in the regulation of GABA(A) receptor structure.", 
    "8": "Doses of radiolabeled water, salicylic acid, lidocaine and diazepam were applied in 2 ml of phosphate buffer saline to the exposed dermis on the thigh of a perfused rat hindlimb. Hindlimbs were perfused with Krebs-Heinseleit buffer at 37 degrees C containing 4% albumin or 2.5% dextran 40 at a constant rate of 4 ml/min. Clearance of solutes from dermal sites was monitored by frequent sampling at the dermal site and of the outflowing perfusate. In addition, the concentration of solutes in the various tissues below the treated and contralateral sites were determined at the end of a perfusion after dissection, solubilization and scintillation counting of the individual tissues. Estimates of the absorption rate constant from the dermis and the elimination rate constant from the perfused limb were made by the simultaneous fitting of absorption and efflux data with a one-compartmental pharmacokinetic model. Diazepam was cleared fastest through the dermis, followed by water, salicylic acid and lidocaine. The efflux of diazepam and salicylic acid from the hindlimb was significantly enhanced by the presence of albumin in the perfusate relative to no albumin (P < .05), whereas the efflux of water and lidocaine were unaffected by changes in albumin content. Analysis of individual tissues at the end of the perfusion showed that water had the highest relative tissue concentrations with diazepam the least, high concentrations appearing to partition into and remain associated with the dermis. The presence of albumin in the perfusate significantly increased the concentration of diazepam found in contralateral skin samples (P < .05) and showed the same trend for salicylic acid and lidocaine. These findings show that protein binding significantly affects the deep tissue penetration and distribution of dermally applied solutes and that this effect is more prominent for highly protein-bound solutes.", 
    "9": "Triazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4. Diltiazem is an inhibitor of this isozyme and interacts with midazolam, another substrate of this enzyme. Therefore the possible interaction between triazolam and diltiazem is worth investigation.", 
    "10": "A balanced, randomized, double-blind crossover study design was used, with an interval of 2 weeks between phases. Ten healthy volunteers were given 60 mg diltiazem orally or placebo three times a day for 2 days. On the second day they received a single 0.25 mg oral dose of triazolam, after which plasma samples were collected and effects of triazolam measured for up to 17 hours.", 
    "11": "Diltiazem increased the mean area under the triazolam concentration-time curve threefold (p < 0.001) and the elimination half-life (p < 0.001) and the peak plasma concentration of triazolam twofold (p < 0.005). The increased concentrations of triazolam during the diltiazem phase were associated with increased and prolonged pharmacodynamic effects.", 
    "12": "Diltiazem has a clinically significant interaction with oral triazolam. The data is highly suggestive that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of triazolam during the first-pass and elimination phases. Prescription of triazolam should be avoided if a patient is using diltiazem or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A.", 
    "13": "Chronic insomnia often can be traced to a treatable physical or psychological disorder. Thorough history taking and physical examination, including comprehensive questioning about the patient's sleep disturbance, may be enough to define the underlying cause and thus avoid the use of benzodiazepines. Mood disorders are prevalent in patients with chronic insomnia, and treatment is best directed at the psychological problem rather than the sleep disturbance. If treatment is not adequate, psychological referral is appropriate.", 
    "14": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) reverse transcriptases (RTs) are evolutionary related. To study the effect of homologous sequence replacements on polymerase function and to map the determinants of the lack of susceptibility of HIV-2 RT to nonnucleoside drugs, a series of chimeric HIV-1/HIV-2 RTs were constructed. Analysis of the chimeric RTs showed that wild-type levels of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity were retained when both finger and palm subdomains were exchanged as a unit between the two parental RTs. Analysis of enzymatically active chimeras for inhibition by the thiobenzimidazolone derivative TIBO R82150 showed that a segment of HIV-2 RT at 212-250, when placed in the HIV-1 RT context, conferred a 40-fold decrease in susceptibility to TIBO R82150. Site-directed mutagenesis of this segment found Tyr227 to be a key residue in this segment for the natural resistance of HIV-2 RT to TIBO R82150.", 
    "15": "A sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet absorbance detection has been developed to simultaneously determine the concentrations of nerisopam (EGIS-6775) and its N-acetyl metabolite (EGIS-7649) from human plasma. The separation of the investigated compounds and internal standard was achieved on a Nucleosil 7 C(18) column with 2 mM heptanesulphonic acid containing 0.04 M phosphoric acid-acetonitrile-methanol (70:25:5, v/v), pH 2.7 mobile phase. The detection was performed at 385 nm. The compounds were isolated from plasma by Bakerbond C(18) solid-phase extraction. The limit of quantitation was 10 ng/ml plasma for each compound investigated. The assay has been validated with respect to accuracy, precision and system suitability. All validated parameters were found to be within the necessary limits. On the basis of the sensitivity, linearity and validation parameters, the developed analytical method was found to be suitable for the determination of nerisopam and its N-acetyl metabolite from human plasma and for application in pharmacokinetic studies and human drug monitoring. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from twelve human volunteers are reported. It was found that nerisopam acetylation is polymorphic: the volunteers with fast or slow acetylator phenotypes produced significantly different plasma concentrations. In slow acetylator phenotypes the concentration of nerisopam was considerably higher in plasma, while the level of its acetyl metabolite was higher in plasma of fast acetylators.", 
    "16": "Four mixed 10-undecenoyl-3,5-dimethylphenylaminocarbonyl derivatives of cellulose, with an increasing proportion of alkenoyl groups, were synthesized and chemically bonded on allylsilica gel. The influence of the degree of fixation of the cellulose derivative on the matrix for the four resulting chiral stationary phases on their selectivity is discussed.", 
    "17": "The effect of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands: PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline-3-carboxamid e), Ro 5-4864 (4-chlorodiazepam), hemin, N-methyl protoporphyrin IX and protoporphyrin IX on liver mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol was studied by adding them together with [4-14C]cholesterol. N-Methyl protoporphyrin IX, PK11195 and protoporphyrin IX stimulated mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of [4-14C] cholesterol in vitro, the first two being the most potent (2-3-fold increase). Ro 5-4864 and hemin were not active. 27-Hydroxylation of [4-14C]cholesterol was reduced to below control levels (respectively 40 and 56% decrease compared to control, P < 0.01) when PK11195, N-methyl protoporphyrin IX or protoporphyrin IX were allowed to equilibrate in vitro with mitochondria for 20 min at 37 degrees C. Hepatic protoporphyria was induced using 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) (100 mg/kg, i.p.) to study the effect of in vivo accumulation of large amounts of dicarboxylic porphyrins, i.e. endogenous peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands, on cholesterol 27-hydroxylation. DDC treatment caused an increase in total porphyrin content in liver homogenate (10-fold) and mitochondria (2-fold). Mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of [4-14C]cholesterol was depressed after treatment (60% decrease, P < 0.01). We suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands act on liver mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol by a mechanism coupled to these receptors and that the time of exposure of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors to ligands is a major factor. The modulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol production may have a physiological role in liver and possibly in other tissues.", 
    "18": "The influence of the ligand PK 11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1- methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide), antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, on the inotropic response of the perfused rat heart to diazepam (7-chloro-5-phenyl-methyl- 1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) was studied. Diazepam induced a positive inotropic response which was preceded by a transient negative inotropic response. Concentrations of 10(-7) M PK 11195 were ineffective, whereas concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) M PK 11195 reduced the positive inotropic response significantly. At 5 x 10(-5) M PK 11195 the response was completely abolished. The negative inotropic response was not changed by either concentration of PK 11195 used. It is concluded that the positive inotropic response of the isolated rat heart to diazepam may well be mediated through peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors; the negative inotropic response must be related to other (more complex) mechanisms.", 
    "19": "The pineal organ of teleost fish receives photic information directly through specialized photoreceptor cells that transmit their light response to second-order neurons and respond also with an endocrine light-dependent melatonin signal. In the present study we have analyzed the action of diazepam, a full agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, on the photic regulation of the endocrine melatonin response of cultured trout pineal organs. Melatonin release of explanted pineal organs was clearly dependent on the irradiance of incident light with a maximum change during mesopic illuminations. Addition of diazepam to the superfusion medium significantly increased melatonin production in the mesopic and partly in the photopic range of illumination, without showing clear effects in the dark-adapted organ. Flumazenil, a central acting benzodiazepine antagonist, slightly reduced melatonin secretion. The action of diazepam appears to be comparable to a dark-pulse in the mesopic range of illuminations.", 
    "20": "The involvement of the M2 muscarinic receptor in contractile responses of the guinea pig trachea, guinea pig esophagus, and rat fundus was investigated. In the standard assay, oxotremorine-M elicited contractions of the trachea with an EC50 value of approximately 73 nanoM.--2- -(Diethylamino)methyl- -1-piperidinyl-acetyl--5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido-2,3-b--1,4- benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) at 1 and 10 microM antagonized these contractions by 2.1- and 9.0-fold increases in the EC50 value for oxotremorine-M. These effects are consistent with antagonism of an M3-mediated contractile response. In subsequent experiments, the M3 receptors were first inactivated selectively by incubation with N-(2-chloroethyl)-4- piperidinyl diphenylacetate (4-DAMP mustard) (40 nanoM) for 1 hr in the presence of AF-DX 116 (1 microM) followed by extensive washing. In 4-DAMP mustard treated trachea, oxotremorine-M elicited contractions with an EC50 value of 0.31 microM in the presence of histamine (10 microM) and forskolin (4 microM). Under these conditions, AF-DX 116 at 1 and 10 microM antagonized contractions to oxotremorine-M by 8- and 59-fold increases in the EC50, respectively, while para- fluorohexahydrosiladiphenidol(p-F-HHSiD) (0.1 microM) had no effect. These effects are consistent with a contraction being mediated by an M2 receptor. In the guinea pig esophagus and rat fundus, AF-DX 116 and p-F-HHSiD blocked contractions measured under similar conditions with magnitudes intermediate between what would be expected from an M2 and an M3 receptor, suggesting that perhaps both subtypes contribute to the overall contractile response under these conditions. In addition, contractions of the guinea pig trachea measured in the presence of histamine and forskolin were pertussis toxin sensitive. These results that, in the trachea, M2 receptors can dominate the contractile response after a majority of the M3 receptors have been inactivated, whereas in the guinea pig esophagus and rat fundus, M2 receptors may contribute to, but do not play a dominant role in the overall response.", 
    "21": "The GABAA receptor in brain membranes prepared from bovine cerebral cortex and cerebellum has been photoaffinity-labelled by the classical benzodiazepine agonist, [3H]flunitrazepam, or by the partial inverse agonist [3H]Ro 15-4513. Following solubilization and precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, the photoaffinity-labelled receptor preparations were subjected to specific chemical cleavage using hydroxylamine, a reagent which cleaves specifically at a relatively rare Asn-Gly bond. The resulting peptides were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mapping of these peptides to the known amino acid sequences of the GABAA receptor subunits has localized the photoaffinity-labelling sites for these two ligands to distinct portions of the alpha subunits. It is shown that the site for [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity-labelling in the receptor populations of both the cerebral cortex and cerebellum occurs within residues 1-103 of the bovine alpha 1 subunit sequence (or within analogous segments of homologous alpha subunits). In contrast, the site of photoaffinity-labelling by [3H]Ro 15-4513 in the cerebral cortex and in the diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor population of the cerebellum lies between residues 104 and the carboxy-terminus of the bovine alpha 1 or homologous alpha subunits. However, the [3H]Ro 15-4513 photoaffinity-labelling site for the diazepam-insensitive receptors of the cerebellum is shown to occur within residues 1-101 (alpha 6 subunit numbering). These results demonstrate that the photoaffinity-labelling sites for [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro 15-4513 on the GABAA receptor are localized to distinct domains of the alpha 1 subunit and that [3H]Ro 15-4513 photoaffinity labels a site on the alpha 6 subunit that is unique from its site of labelling on the alpha 1 subunit.", 
    "22": "The characteristics of the receptors involved in the protective action of benzodiazepines against ethanol-induced gastric lesions were investigated by studying the effect of benzodiazepine ligands on such lesions in both intact and unilaterally vagotomized rats. Clonazepam [5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-7-nitro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one] a specific central-type receptor agonist (0.625-2.5 mg/kg p.o. or i.p.) and CGS 9896 [2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,5-dihydropyrazolo(4,3-c)quinoline-3(3H)-one] a non-sedative partial agonist with anxiolytic properties (2.5-10 mg/kg p.o.) significantly reduced the gastric damage induced by ethanol (10 ml/kg of a 50% solution v/v p.o.) in non-vagotomized rats but Ro 5-4864 [7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine- 2 -one] a pure peripheral-type receptor agonist (5-20 mg/kg p.o.) failed to affect this damage. The protective action of clonazepam and CGS 9896 against ethanol-induced gastric lesions was blocked, dose dependently, by the central-type receptor antagonist, flumazenil [ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo(1,4)f1p4odiazepine-3-carbox ylate] (1.25-20 mg/kg i.p.). In the unilaterally vagotomized rat, ethanol produced lesions in the right (vagotomized) and the left (non-vagotomized) halves of the gastric mucosa to nearly the same extent, while clonazepam and CGS 9896 uniformly decreased the lesions in both halves. It is concluded that central-type benzodiazepine receptors located in the stomach, specifically those mediating the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines, are involved in the protective action of benzodiazepines against ethanol-induced gastric lesions.", 
    "23": "Rats chronically treated with diazepam (DZM) (2 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 21 days, were subsequently tested at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after the last injection in the elevated plus-maze. When compared with their respective controls, withdrawn animals showed an anxiogenic response since they exhibited a significant decrease in the % of time spent in the open arms, and a reduction in open and total arms entries at 24 and 48 h following the last benzodiazepine administration. No other behavioral differences were observed in the remaining groups. Ninety-six hours following DZM withdrawal, when the anxiogenic response was no longer evident, withdrawn rats showed a significant decrease in immobility time when exposed to a forced-swim test (FST). GABA stimulation of chloride uptake in cortical tissue was measured in BDZ-withdrawn rats or vehicle-treated animals with or without exposure to the FST. An enhanced chloride uptake following GABA stimulation was observed in vehicle-treated rats following the swimming trial. However, similar values of chloride uptake were found among rats withdrawn from DZM at 96 h either exposed or not to the FST and vehicle-treated animals without prior stress exposure. These findings show that BDZ withdrawal alters the neurochemical and behavioral response to a subsequent stressful experience. These lines of evidence may indicate that BZD withdrawal reduced the ability to develop an adaptive response to stress.", 
    "24": "The aim of the study was to investigate the pattern of the use of drugs among young conscripts by a test screening of their urine. The participants in the investigation also filled in a questionnaire about use of drugs. The urine samples from 916 young recruits were examined for cannabinoids and 429 were also examined for amphetamines, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines. We found 68 (7.8%) positive tests for cannabis and a negligible number of positive tests for other drugs. The questionnaire showed a lower statement of use of drugs though 3.3% stated a daily or weekly use of cannabis. Fifty-eight percent of the soldiers admitted that they had tried cannabis. Six percent had used other drugs. The consumption of alcohol is low during weekdays. We concluded that the conscripts did not constitute a population of drug abusers. We recommend that urine test screening (regular or spot test) should be incorporated in the future medical examination in the Danish Army to pinpoint personnel with a moderate use of cannabis.",

    "26": "Sequential changes in tumor size, number of DNA synthesizing cells (labelling index [LI]), glucose utilization (LCGU), protein synthesis (LCPS), and peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) density were examined after chemotherapy for seven days. This was done using antibromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemical stain and multiple tracer quantitative autoradiography in a C6 rat brain with an implanted glioma. On Day 10 after inoculation, the rats were divided into 5 experimental groups: (1) a nontreatment group (control Group 1); (2) a group received 5% dextrose intraarterial (IA) administration (control Group 2); (3) a group received 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl) nitrosourea (BCNU) intravenous (i.v.) administration (Group 3) (5% dextrose was solvent); (4) a group received BCNU IA administration (Group 4) (5% dextrose was solvent); and (5) a group received sarcosinamide chloroethyl nitrosourea (SarCNU) IA administration (Group 5) (solvent as for the BCNU group).", 
    "27": "Three treatments showed a significant decrease (P < 0.003) in tumor growth. The most effective treatment was BCNU IA and SarCNU IA was moderately effective. BCNU i.v. showed no effect on tumor growth when compared with the two control groups. The change in the peak LI correlated well with the peak LCGU. These parameters decreased markedly and significantly in both Group 4 and Group 5 from Day 1 after treatment. The rates of the decrease in these biologic factors also correlated well with a decrease in the tumor growth. The LCPS did not correlate with a decrease in the LI or LCGU. The dissociation constant (Kd) and densities of the receptors PBR (B max) did not change significantly in any of the treatment groups during the observation period.", 
    "28": "From the results presented, we concluded that changes in the LI and LCGU represent the most reliable parameters with which to predict the response or sensitivity of this glial tumor to the treatments applied. These data suggest that if changes in peak LCGU were measured in tumors using positron emission tomography, they might be instrumental in providing in vivo information about the sensitivity of a tumor to a given treatment without the need for repeated tumor biopsy.", 
    "29": "Rats trained on a Delayed Matching To Position (DMTP) task displayed mediating behavior during delays to solve the task. Infusion of the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine into the medial Prefrontal Cortex area (mPFC), dose dependently impaired performance independent of delay. These results indicate that scopolamine does not specifically affect working memory. Infusion of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine, muscarinic subtype receptor antagonists, the dopamine (D1) antagonist SCH23390, and of the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline, did not affect performance in the DMTP task. In a post-hoc analysis scopolamine was found to impair discriminability in a delay-dependent manner only in animals that used mediating behavior in the majority of the trials. Furthermore, a time sampling method indicated that scopolamine infusions into the mPFC disrupted mediating behavior during the task. Results suggest that cholinergic systems in the mPFC play a role in directing attention to task relevant behavior.", 
    "30": "This paper describes a highly specific and sensitive method for quantifying oxazepam and its diastereoisomeric glucuronides in serum. The method involves sample clean-up by solid-phase extraction on C18 cartridge followed by quantitation on a reversed-phase HPLC column. Diazepam is used as internal standard. Extraction recovery from serum proved to be more than 86%. Precision, expressed as C.V., was in the range 1.2-9.5%. The limits of quantification were 40, 400, and 200 nmol/l for oxazepam, S-(+)- and R-(-)-glucuronides, respectively. This method was applied to the determination of oxazepam and its diastereoisomeric glucuronides in serum collected during a pharmacokinetic study performed in sheep after oral administration of racemic oxazepam. S-(+)/R-(-) ratios were measured all along the sampling time collection and the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined.",

Among thirty samples obtained from polydrug abusers, thirteen tested positive for nordiazepam, in the range of 0.25-18.87 ng/mg. Five samples were also positive for oxazepam, in the range 0.11-0.50 ng/mg.",

Cholecystectomy was associated with increased risk, especially in females, for right sided and transverse colon cancer, OR 1.5 (CI 0.9-2.5) and OR 1.8 (CI 0.8-3.5), respectively. Ulcerative colitis increased the risk, OR 11 (CI 3.5-38). Also hyperplasia of the prostate gland and diabetes in men were related to an increased risk with OR 4.4 (CI 1.5-13) and OR 2.9 (CI 1.4-6.0), respectively. For men and women together diabetes mellitus yielded an increased OR of 1.7 (1.0-3.0). Regarding drugs somewhat increased risks were found for beta-2-stimulating agents, OR 1.9 (CI 0.6-5.4), benzodiazepine, OR 1.7 (CI 0.9-3.3), iron, OR 1.9 (CI 0.5-6.7), and paracetamol, OR 2.5 (0.6-8.5). Increased risks were found for hydralazine in men, OR 2.3 (CI 0.7-7.0), methyldopa in men, OR 4.3 (1.1-18), sulfonylurea, OR 2.9 (CI 1.2-6.7), and verapamil, OR 22 (CI 2.4-480). Somewhat decreased risk was found for indometacin, OR 0.6 (0.2-1.6).", 
    "33": "Acute (10mg/kg, i.p.) and chronic (10mg/kg/day, i.p. for 10 days) diazepam treatments decreased hippocampal dialysate 5-HT (but not 5-HIAA) concentrations in freely moving rats, suggesting decreased availability of 5-HT to receptors. Twenty-four hours after the last chronic diazepam injection, hippocampal dialysate 5-HT did not differ from that in vehicle-treated rats. However, although reduced 5-HT availability often increases postsynaptic 5-HT receptor-mediated responses, the anxiogenic effect of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), which is mediated by the activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(2C) receptors, was not increased (as indicated by the elevated plus-maze test) when given 2 days after 10 days of chronic diazepam, in intact rats. Nevertheless, concurrently in that test, significantly increased anxiety occurred after withdrawal from chronic diazepam (10mg/kg/day x 10 days). The results suggest that benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced anxiety is not mediated by changes in 5-HT(2C) receptor sensitivity, and may be independent of the benzodiazepine-induced reduction of 5-HT release in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "34": "The pleasant subjective effects produced by alcohol undoubtedly reinforce drinking behaviour. Alcohol positively reinforces or rewards drinking by producing a mild euphoria. Alcohol also has anxiolytic effects that negatively reinforce drinking. The reinforcing effects of alcohol are mediated by several neurochemical systems, with dopamine and serotonin playing major roles in reward and the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor system playing a major role in negative reinforcement. Research from our laboratory suggests that the behavioural effects of alcohol change when blood alcohol levels are changing and that these changes correspond to alterations of specific neurochemical systems. Behavioural activation and reward effects appear to occur as blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) increase. Depressive and aversive effects of alcohol occur during the period when BACs decrease. The observed correlation between behavioural and neuropharmacological changes and alcohol consumption suggest that alcohol produces a unique cascade over time that may provide clues to its long-sought specific mechanisms of action. In alcohol-dependent individuals, chronic exposure to alcohol may alter the function and communication between the liver, brain and other vital organ systems involved in hunger and the maintenance of nutrition. Under such conditions, the importance of alcohol in the diet may be enhanced such that hunger signals in the alcohol-dependent individual motivate the consumption of alcohol. Therefore, hunger for alcohol may provide an additional source of reinforcement. Endogenous opioid mechanisms may be important in this form of alcohol reinforcement.", 
    "35": "Although cholecystokinin is localized within neuronal fibres of the pancreas, a physiological role for intrapancreatic cholecystokinin has not been identified. The strategy of this study was to elicit pure vagal stimulation electrically, and to use specific receptor antagonists to identify the mediators of exocrine pancreatic secretion. We conclude that vagal stimulation of the rat pancreas involves ganglionic neurotransmission and release of acetylcholine and cholecystokinin from intrapancreatic, postganglionic fibres. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a physiological role for intrapancreatic cholecystokinin.", 
    "36": "A model of reversible functional disorders of the escape response (ER) for studying the effect of tranquilizers is proposed. The model is based on the unexpected action of electric current used regardless of the specific relation (stimulus-response effect). This results in enhanced emotional stress, reduces ER, and increases intersignal responses. The model proposed has less in common with the conflict situation because no interference of the opposite motivations is suggested, namely, the formation and disturbance of ER is based on the same unconditioned stimulus and test performance does not suggest punishment with electric current. We found that hydazepam (20 mg/kg) prevents and phenazepam (0.1 mg/kg) reduces the ER disorders.", 
    "37": "Olanzapine is a potential new \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent. This double-blind, acute phase study compared two doses of olanzapine [1 mg/day (Olz1.0); 10 mg/day (Olz10.0)] with placebo in the treatment of 152 patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia and had a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-total score (items scored 0-6) > or = 24. In overall symptomatology improvement [BPRS-total score and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-total score], Olz10.0 was statistically significantly superior to placebo. In positive symptom improvement (PANSS-positive score, BPRS-positive score), Olz10.0 was statistically significantly superior to placebo. In negative symptom improvement (PANSS-negative score), Olz10.0 was statistically superior to placebo. Olz 1.0 was clinically comparable to placebo in all efficacy comparisons. The only adverse event to show an overall statistically significant incidence difference was anorexia (reported for 10% of placebo-treated and 0% of Olz10.0-treated patients). The Olz10.0-treated patients improved over baseline with respect to parkinsonian and akathisia symptoms, and these changes were comparable with those observed with placebo. There were no dystonias associated with Olz10.0 treatment. At endpoint, the incidence of patients with elevated prolactin values did not differ statistically significantly between placebo-treated and Olz10.0-treated patients. Olanzapine appears to be not only safe and effective, but a promising atypical antipsychotic candidate.", 
    "38": "We have studied striatal D2 dopamine binding in schizophrenic patients treated with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine. 123I iodobenzamide (IBZM) single photon emission tomography (SPET) was used to estimate striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in vivo. Patients were recruited from a prospective, double blind controlled trial of olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment. In vivo striatal D2 binding data from olanzapine treated patients (n = 6) were compared with previously reported data from typical antipsychotic responsive (n = 10); clozapine (n = 10); and risperidone (n = 6) treated patient groups. Mean % Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score (BPRS) improvement following olanzapine treatment was 49% (SD 44). The hypothesis that clinical improvement in olanzapine treated patients would be associated with higher mean striatal D2 binding of 123I IBZM (reflecting lower levels of D2 occupancy) than typical antipsychotic (1.25 +/- 0.05) or risperidone (1.24 +/- 0.04) treatment was confirmed. Olanzapine treated patients had similar levels of striatal D2 binding in vivo (1.41 +/- 0.06) as those treated with clozapine (1.49 +/- 0.04). This preliminary evidence suggests olanzapine is another atypical antipsychotic drug in which therapeutic response is not associated with a high degree of striatal D2 receptor occupancy in vivo.", 
    "39": "The ability of the atypical antipsychotic drug candidate olanzapine to antagonize dopamine, serotonin, alpha-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in vivo was assessed by various neurochemical measurements in rat brain. Olanzapine increased the concentrations of the dopamine metabolites DOPAC and HVA in striatum and nucleus accumbens. Olanzapine antagonized the pergolide-induced decrease of striatal DOPA concentrations in rats treated with gammabutyrolactone and NSD1015 and increased striatal 3-methoxytyramine concentrations in nomifensine-treated rats (but not after gammabutyrolactone administration), suggesting that olanzapine blocked terminal and somatodendritic autoreceptors on dopamine neurons. Inactivation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors by EEDQ was antagonized by olanzapine. The ex vivo binding of the 5HT2 radioligand [3H]-ketanserin was inhibited by olanzapine treatment, as was quipazine-induced increases in MHPG-SO4, evidence suggesting that olanzapine antagonized 5HT2 receptors. At higher doses, olanzapine increased the concentrations of the norepinephrine metabolite, MHPG-SO4, probably by blocking alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Olanzapine inhibited ex vivo binding of the muscarinic antagonist radioligand [3H]-pirenzepine and lowered concentrations of striatal, but not hippocampal, acetylcholine levels. The findings provide evidence that olanzapine antagonized dopamine, serotonin, alpha-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in vivo, consistent with its high affinity for these receptor sites in vitro.", 
    "40": "This study compared the ability of the novel atypical antipsychotic olanzapine with that of clozapine to reverse the d-amphetamine-induced inhibition of substantia nigra (A9) and ventral tegmental area (A10) dopamine (DA) cells. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from A9 and A10 DA cells in anesthetized rats. When administered alone, neither olanzapine nor clozapine altered the firing rate of A9 or A10 DA cells. Administration of d-amphetamine (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, IV, decreased the firing rate of A9 and A10 DA cells. Olanzapine completely reversed the inhibitory effects of d-amphetamine on A10 DA cells (ED100 = 0.18 mg/kg, IV) and on A9 DA cells (ED100 = 1.0 mg/mg, IV). Clozapine completely reversed the inhibitory effects of d-amphetamine on A10 DA cells (ED100 = 3.8 mg/kg, IV), but only partially reversed the effects of d-amphetamine on A9 DA cells at the highest dose tested (8.0 mg/kg, IV). Thus, olanzapine, like clozapine, was more potent in reversing the effects of d-amphetamine on A10 than A9 DA cells. In addition, olanzapine was more potent than clozapine in the reversal of d-amphetamine effects on A9 and A10 DA cells. These results indicate that olanzapine and clozapine have similar effects on DA unit activity and predict that olanzapine should have an atypical antipsychotic profile in man.", 
    "41": "The effects of the putative atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and ICI 204,636 on behavioural responses to the selective \"D2-like\" dopamine receptor agonist RU 24213 and to the selective \"D1-like\" agonist A 68930 were compared with those of the prototype atypical antipsychotic clozapine, the selective D1-like antagonist SCH 23390 and the selective D2-like antagonist YM 09151-2. Olanzapine (0.4-2.0 mg/kg) and ICI 204,636 (4.0-36.0 mg/kg), like clozapine (4.0-36.0 mg/kg) and SCH 23390 (0.01-1.0 mg/kg), effected at best modest reduction in typical sniffing and locomotor responses and, with the exception of ICI 204,636, released episodes of atypical myoclonic jerking to RU 24213 (12.5 mg/kg); a high dose of olanzapine (10.0 mg/kg), like YM 09151-2 (0.005-0.5 mg/kg), blocked all responsivity to RU 24213. Conversely, olanzapine (0.4-2.0 mg/kg) and ICI 204,636 (4.0-36.0 mg/kg), like clozapine (4.0-12.0 mg/kg) and SCH 23390 (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), readily blocked typical grooming responses to A 68930 (0.5 mg/kg); YM 09151-2 failed to block grooming and exerted more variable effects. Olanzapine and, to a lesser extent, ICI 204,636 share with clozapine a preferential action to attenuate D1-mediated function; given their lack of selective affinity for D1-like receptors, this common effect may be exerted at an alternative level of synaptic function. The action of olanzapine and particularly ICI 204,636 to release additional episodes of atypical vacuous chewing to A 68930 indicates some deviation from a wholly clozapine-like profile, the clinical significance of which remains to be specified.", 
    "42": "The anxiolytic properties of diazepam and its effects on plasma corticosterone levels were compared in male and female, water deprived rats exposed to the punished (0.8 mA) drinking procedure. The effects of diazepam on unpunished licking, tested under familiar or unfamiliar conditions, and on the lick latency were also studied and a comparison between the two sexes was made. Both punished and unpunished drinking were less in females than in males. In both sexes, a clear anticonflict effect, i.e. a much greater effect on punished than on unpunished drinking, was obtained with 2 and 4 mg/kg, but not with 1 mg/kg, of diazepam i.p. Plasma corticosterone levels were higher in water deprived females than in males. Following the punished and unpunished drinking procedure, plasma corticosterone levels were found to have decreased more in female than in male rats, especially after administration of 1 mg/kg of diazepam. Diazepam had similar anticonflict effects in rats of both sexes but had a greater suppressive effect on the plasma corticosterone levels in female rats. There was no correlation between the anxiolytic effects of diazepam and its effect on the plasma corticosterone levels. When testing was done under unfamiliar conditions, the latency to licking was greater in female than in male rats and diazepam (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg) increased this latency in both sexes. The results suggest sex differences in the neuroendocrine, but not in the anxiolytic, effects of diazepam.", 
    "43": "Children often fear medical procedures and interventions. Sedative agents enhance the care of these children who undergo outpatient procedures by decreasing anxiety, increasing cooperativity, and providing amnesia. Although higher dosages and intravenous administration of sedatives often produce improved sedation, adverse effects and complications are more frequent. The goals of therapeutic efficacy and safety must be balanced in all patients. The presence or anticipation of anxiety and pain helps in deciding whether to use a sedative alone, or a regimen also providing analgesia. The patient's clinical cardiorespiratory or neurological status, other relative contraindications, the duration of the intended procedure, and the presence or absence of an intravenous line will help in choosing specific drugs. Drug complications are a common cause of adverse events in patients. The combination of a sedative and analgesic, especially a benzodiazepine and an opioid given intravenously, is associated with a higher risk of serious complications. The practitioner responsible for the administration of a sedative to a child must be competent in its use and have the ability to detect and manage complications. Patients who are deeply sedated should be continuously monitored and observed by an individual dedicated to this task. Vital signs and oxygen saturation should be documented at frequent intervals and the patient should be appropriately monitored until discharge criteria have been met. The risk of serious complications with these agents may be reduced with vigorous monitoring and a judicious choice of dosage.", 
    "44": "Diazepam and other benzodiazepines are sometimes used to alleviate vertigo and dizziness following labyrinthine surgery in humans. While the results of some previous studies have suggested that the administration of diazepam and other CNS depressant drugs following unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL) may impair the vestibular compensation process, the available evidence is unclear. The objective of the present experiment was to examine the effects of multiple injections of a high dose of diazepam (that is, 10 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before and following UL (10 h or 10 and 20 h) on the static symptom, spontaneous ocular nystagmus (SN), in guinea pigs. Although diazepam-treated animals exhibited consistently lower average SN frequency compared to vehicle controls. neither SN frequency nor its rate of compensation were significantly different between the 2 groups. The time to complete SN compensation was also similar for the 2 groups, as estimated from the x intercepts derived from a linear regression analysis. These results suggest that even high doses of diazepam before and following UL do not result in an impairment of compensation of SN in guinea pig.", 
    "45": "A simple, selective high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection at 220 nm is described for quantitation of midazolam and its primary metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam in 100 microL plasma samples from premature infants. A mobile phase of acetonitrile:tetrahydrofuran:phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.7) (35:5:60 v/v) was pumped at 1 mL/min through a C8 Symmetry (150 x 3.9 mm) column. Plasma (100 microL) was extracted with 10% v/v isopropyl alcohol in dichloromethane containing 25 ng/mL climazolam (internal standard, IS) followed by back extraction into phosphoric acid (0.02 M). 1-Hydroxymidazolam, midazolam, and climazolam (IS) were eluted at 4.9, 7.4, 8.4 min, respectively. Recoveries were > 70%. Calibration curves in blank plasma were linear (r > 0.999) from 12.5 to 800 ng/mL. Within-day and between-day imprecision (CV%) was 1.8-6.5%, and 4.1-8.8%, respectively. Inaccuracy was 12.3%. Application of the method was demonstrated by a pharmacokinetic analysis of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam in plasma drawn from 15 premature neonates after a single intravenous dose of midazolam (0.1 mg/kg).", 
    "46": "The effects of flupirtine (CAS 56995-20-1, D-9998, Katadolon) on muscle force and related electromyographic (EMG) activity has been assessed in comparison to tetrazepam and placebo in 12 healthy male volunteers after oral single-dose administration and under steady-state conditions. Muscle functions primarily reflecting dynamic daily demands remained unaffected under flupirtine in contrast to tetrazepam, the latter exhibiting the typical signs of increased (co-)innervation which can be interpreted as a compensation of a decrease of muscle force. Under conditions that serve as a model for static-spastic situations, flupirtine showed a decrease, tetrazepam a typical increase in the force parameter. Under the same conditions, a decrease of the EMG-amplitude was observed for flupirtine and, to a lesser extent, for tetrazepam as well. With respect to its muscle relaxing property, flupirtine differs both, quantitatively and qualitatively from tetrazepam, which has shown effects common for benzodiazepines.", 
    "47": "1. Functional GABA-gated chloride channels are formed when cRNA encoding the Drosophila melanogaster GABA receptor subunit RDL is injected into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. Two-electrode voltage-clamp was used to investigate allosteric modulation of GABA-induced currents recorded from the expressed, bicuculline-insensitive, RDL homo-oligomers. 2. Flunitrazepam (0.1 microM to 100 microM) had no effect on the amplitude of responses to 10 microM GABA (approximately EC10), whereas 4'chlorodiazepam (100 microM) enhanced the amplitude of submaximal responses to GABA. 3-Hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline (1 microM) and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (both 1 and 100 microM) had no effect on currents induced by 30 microM (approximately EC50) GABA. However 100 microM 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline reduced potentiation by 4'chlorodiazepam. 3. The sodium salts of pentobarbitone (10 microM to 1 mM) and phenobarbitone (50 microM to 1 mM) dose-dependently enhanced submaximal GABA responses. Neither barbiturate activated currents in the absence of GABA. 4. At 10 microM, the steroids 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one and alphaxalone (5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-11,20-dione), potentiated submaximal GABA responses. The stereoselectivity of steroid action seen on vertebrate GABAA receptors was observed on RDL homo-oligomers as 5 alpha-pregnan-3 beta-ol-20-one (10 microM) was without effect. None of the three steroids tested activated currents in the absence of GABA. 5. The novel anticonvulsant, loreclezole (100 microM), potentiated the response to 10 microM GABA, but not that of saturating concentrations of GABA. delta-Hexachlorocyclohexane (0.1 microM to 30 microM) was a potent enhancer of submaximal responses to GABA of RDL. 6. The potencies of barbiturates and steroids on RDL homo-oligomers resemble those observed for several in situ insect GABA receptors, whereas those of benzodiazepine binding-site ligands are considerably reduced. The differences in the benzodiazepine pharmacology of RDL homo-oligomers and native GABA receptors, may reflect roles of other subunits in native insect receptors.", 
    "48": "1. The 2,3-benzodiazepines GYKI 52466, GYKI 53405 and GYKI 53655 antagonized AMPA-induced currents in cultured superior colliculus neurones in a non use-dependent manner (steady state IC50s: GYKI 52466 9.8 +/- 0.6 microM; GYKI 53405 3.1 +/- 0.6 microM; GYKI 53655 0.8 +/- 0.1 microM). 2. Higher concentrations of all three antagonists slowed the onset kinetics and quickened the offset kinetics of AMPA-induced currents indicative of an allosteric interaction with the AMPA recognition site. 3. Cyclothiazide (3-300 microM) dramatically slowed desensitization of AMPA-induced currents and potentiated steady state currents (EC50 10.0 +/- 2.5 microM) to a much greater degree than peak currents. Both tau on and tau off were also increased by cyclothiazide in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50: tau on 42.1 +/- 4.5 microM; tau off 31.6 +/- 6.6 microM). 4. Cyclothiazide (10-100 microM) shifted the concentration-response curves of the 2,3-benzodiazepines to the right. For example, with 10 microM cyclothiazide the IC50s of GYKI 52466 and GYKI 53405 on steady-state AMPA-induced currents were 57.9 +/- 9.5 and 41.6 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively. 5. GYKI 53405 and GYKI 52466 concentration-dependently reversed the effects of cyclothiazide (100 microM) on offset kinetics (GYKI 53405 IC50 16.6 +/- 4.2 microM). However, the 2,3-benzodiazepines were unable to reintroduce desensitization in the presence of cyclothiazide and even concentration-dependently slowed the onset kinetics of AMPA responses further (GYKI 53405 EC50 8.0 +/- 2.8 microM). 6. GYKI 52466 decreased the peak amplitude of hippocampal area CA1 AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (e.p.s.cs) (IC50 10.8 +/- 0.8 microM) with no apparent effect on response kinetics. Cyclothiazide prolonged the decay time constant of AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.cs (EC50 35.7 +/- 6.5 microM) with less pronounced effects in slowing e.p.s.c. onset kinetics and increasing e.p.s.c. amplitude. 7. Cyclothiazide (330 microM) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of GYKI 52466 on AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.c. peak amplitude to the right (GYKI 52466 IC50 26.9 +/- 9.4 microM). Likewise, GYKI 52466 (30-100 microM)) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of cyclothiazide on AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.c. decay time constants to the right. 8. In conclusion, cyclothiazide and the 2,3-benzodiazepines seem to bind to different sites on AMPA receptors but exert strong allosteric interactions with one another and with other domains such as the agonist recognition site. The interactions of GYKI 52466 and cyclothiazide on AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.cs in area CA1 of hippocampal slices provide evidence that the decay time constant of these synaptic events are not governed by desensitization.", 
    "49": "1. 2,2'-Pyridylisatogen tosylate (PIT) has been reported to be an irreversible antagonist of responses to adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) at metabotropic purinoceptors (of the P2Y family) in some smooth muscles. When a recombinant P2Y1 purinoceptor (derived from chick brain) is expressed in Xenopus oocytes, ATP and 2-methylthioATP (2-MeSATP) evoke calcium-activated chloride currents (ICl,Ca) in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of PIT on these agonist responses were examined at this cloned P2Y purinoceptor. 2. PIT (0.1-100 microM) failed to stimulate P2Y1 purinoceptors directly but, over a narrow concentration range (0.1-3 microM), caused a time-dependent potentiation (2-5 fold) of responses to ATP. The potentiation of ATP-responses by PIT was not caused by inhibition of oocyte ecto-ATPase. At high concentrations (3-100 microM), PIT irreversibly inhibited responses to ATP with a IC50 value of 13 +/- 9 microM (pKB = 4.88 +/- 0.22; n = 3). PIT failed to potentiate inward currents evoked by 2-MeSATP and only inhibited the responses to this agonist in an irreversible manner. 3. Known P2 purinoceptor antagonists were tested for their ability to potentiate ATP-responses at the chick P2Y1 purinoceptor. Suramin (IC50 = 230 +/- 80 nM; n = 5) and Reactive blue-2 (IC50 = 580 +/- 130 nM; n = 6) reversibly inhibited but did not potentiate ATP-responses. Coomassie brilliant blue-G (0.1-3 microM) potentiated ATP-responses in three experiments, while higher concentrations (3-100 microM) irreversibly inhibited ATP-responses. The results indicated that potentiation and receptor antagonism were dissociable and not a feature common to all known P2 purinoceptor antagonists. 4. In radioligand binding assays, PIT showed a low affinity (pKi < 5) for a range of membrane receptors, including: alpha 1, alpha 2-adrenoceptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, D1, D2, muscarinic, central benzodiazepine, H1, mu-opioid, dihydropyridine and batrachotoxin receptors. PIT showed some affinity (pKi = 5.3) for an adenosine (A1) receptor. 5. In guinea-pig isolated taenia caeci, PIT (12.5-50 microM) irreversibly antagonized relaxations to ATP (3-1000 microM); PIT also directly relaxed the smooth muscle and histamine was used to restore tone. Relaxations to nicotine (10-100 microM), evoked by stimulating intrinsic NANC nerves of taenia caeci preparations in the presence of hyoscine (0.3 microM) and guanethidine (17 microM), were not affected by PIT (50 microM, for 25-60 min). 6. These experiments indicate that PIT causes an irreversible antagonism of ATP receptors but, for recombinant chick P2Y1 purinoceptors, this effect is preceded by potentiation of ATP agonism. The initial potentiation by PIT (and by Coomassie brilliant blue-G) of ATP-responses raises the possibility of designing a new class of modulatory drugs to enhance purinergic transmission at metabotropic purinoceptors.", 
    "50": "The effects of pretreatment with pertussis toxin on pentylenetetrazole-, bicuculline-, aminophylline- and pilocarpine-induced seizures were investigated in mice. In animals treated intracerebroventricularly with pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram animal-1 120 h prior to testing), the CD50 (convulsive dose in 50%) values were considerably decreased in comparison with the CD50 in sham-treated animals. CD50 values of pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline, pilocarpine and aminophylline were calculated to be 39.9, 2.0, 262 and 141 mg kg-1, whereas they were calculated to be 57.7, 2.7, 324 and 230 mg kg-1 in sham-treated animals. The observations suggest that the enhanced sensitivity to a number of chemical convulsants irrespective of their mode of action possibly results from a functional suppression of inhibitory transmission at receptors coupled to pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins, rather than a direct action on G protein linked excitatory neurotransmission. Pertussis toxin significantly decreased the protective action of carbamazepine, increasing its ED50 (effective dose in 50%) from 14.8 to 20.1 mg kg-1 in a maximal electroshock convulsive test. It influenced the ED50 of neither diphenylhydantoin nor diazepam. The diminution of carbamazepine's efficacy might result from a summation effect of adenosine receptor antagonist properties of the drug and a suppression of transmission at adenosine receptors coupled to G proteins sensitive to pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin pretreatment remained without any significant influence on the total plasma levels of carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin and diazepam. This may lead to the conclusion that the interaction between pertussis toxin and carbamazepine does not seem to be of a pharmacokinetic nature and occurs probably at neuronal level.", 
    "51": "A sample of 329 heroin users were interviewed regarding their personal experience of non-fatal heroin overdose. Experience of overdose was widespread, with two-thirds of subjects (68%) reporting having overdosed. The median number of life-time overdoses was three, with males and females equally likely to have overdosed. The majority (62%) of most recent heroin overdoses occurred in conjunction with the consumption of other central nervous system depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines and other opioids). Logistic regression analyses indicated three independent factors associated with having overdosed: longer heroin using careers, greater heroin dependence and higher levels of alcohol consumption. Implications for the reduction in the prevalence and frequency of overdose are discussed.", 
    "52": "The behavioural effects of an extract of Cassia siamea, a plant used in Thai traditional medicine, and barakol, its active chemical, were studied on an elevated plus-maze compared with diazepam. An aqueous extract of C. siamea (1, 6, and 12 g/kg body wt., orally) produced a small increase in the percentage of the open: total number of arm entries and time, time spent on the end of the open arms, total number of arm entries, and number of rears/min. Barakol [10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (IP)] significantly increased all of these behavioural parameters in a manner similar to diazepam (1 mg/kg, IP, 30 or 60 min before testing), except that barakol and not diazepam increased both the number of rears and total arm entries. Barakol at 25 and 50 mg/kg increased the percentage of the open: total number of arm entries and time and number of rears. The results indicate that barakol has anxiolytic properties similar to diazepam but differs from diazepam in that it also increases exploratory and locomotor behaviour, as shown by the number of rears and total arm entries.", 
    "53": "Alcohol-nontolerant (ANT) rats, produced by selective breeding for high sensitivity to motor-impairing effects of ethanol, have a point mutation in the cerebellar gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor alpha 6 subunit, which has been proposed to underlie enhanced sensitivity to benzodiazepine agonists as well. We compared ANT and alcohol-tolerant (AT) rats using behavioral and neurochemical methods to assess the significance of alpha 6- and non alpha 6-containing GABAA receptor subtypes. Motor performance in a tilting plane test was largely unaffected by a type I benzodiazepine receptor-preferring agonist, zolpidem [1-10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (IP)], partial benzodiazepine agonists bretazenil and ZG-63 (both at 40 mg/kg, IP), and a novel broad-spectrum anticonvulsant loreclezole (40 mg/kg, IP) in both ANT and AT rats. In contrast, diazepam (10 mg/kg, IP) impaired performance of the ANT but not AT animals. These data, supported by results from brain regional autoradiography of [3H]Ro15-4513 and membrane binding of [3H]ZG-63 and [35S]TBPS as influenced by these ligands, strongly suggest that only ligands with full agonist actions on mutant (ANT) but not wild-type (AT) alpha 6-containing GABAA receptors are able to produce motor impairment in the ANT rats.", 
    "54": "The hot plate paradigm for pain threshold was used in two experiments to investigate the effects of the benzodiazepine midazolam and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil on the acquisition of conditioned hypoalgesia. In Experiment 1, an infusion of midazolam (10 micrograms) into the nucleus accumbens, but not into the striatum or intermediate reticular zone, resulted in a complete blocking of the acquisition of conditioned hypoalgesia. Two possible mechanisms underlying this disruption in learning are discussed. Experiment 2 revealed that systemically administered flumazenil (10 mg/kg) was capable of blocking the effect of midazolam observed in Experiment 1 only when administered in such a manner as to prevent any activity of midazolam at benzodiazepine receptors. These results suggest that the effect of midazolam observed in Experiment 1 was mediated by a relatively short action at benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "55": "Differential development of tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines (BZs) is a common clinical phenomenon. To examine whether the development of tolerance to the response-suppressant and antipunishment effects of BZs were differentially regulated in animals, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated chronically with either the BZ receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 25 mg/kg, IP, b.i.d.) or saline for 15 weeks and examined under a multiple schedule of operant behavior. Chronic administration of CDP produced tolerance to its suppressive effects on unpunished responding (RI 80 s) but no tolerance to its enhancing effects on punished responding. This conclusion is supported by three observations. First, repeated priming with CDP produced tolerance to its response-suppressive effects in the RI 80-s schedule and revealed increases in punished responding. Second, baseline levels for punished responding remained elevated over the 15-week treatment period. Third, tolerance developed to the response-suppressant effects of CDP under the RI 80-s schedule, as indicated by a sixfold shift to the right in the dose-response curves for rats treated chronically with CDP when compared to saline-treated controls. However, tolerance did not develop to the antipunishment effects of CDP, as indicated by no differences in the dose-response curves for punished responding. Discontinuation of chronic treatment disrupted unpunished responding only on the first day, and reversed the increase in punished responding. Taken together, these results indicate that differential regulation occurs for the development of tolerance to the response-suppressant and antipunishment effects of BZs.", 
    "56": "Two-day-old chicks were selected on their second escape performance in a one-trial, maze-learning task, and termed high-performance (H-P), moderate-performance (M-P), and low-performance (L-P) chicks. The learning degree was expressed by the escape time improvement being respectively the 64, 46, and 24%. Then, the three selected groups were maintained to reach 15 days of age and then submitted to acute swimming stress, and [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro 5-4864 receptor bindings were performed on synaptosomal/mitochondrial membranes from forebrain. The receptor number for both radioligands in stressed high-performance chicks was significantly higher than in stressed low-performance chicks. The results suggest that higher performance chicks were more susceptible than lower performance chicks to acute stress associated to increase of both central and peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, probably due to differences in the degree of endogenous emotionality.", 
    "57": "The activity of LY288513, an investigational cholecystokinin (CCK)B antagonist, was evaluated in a wide range of pharmacological tests in mice and rats. The anxiolytic benzodiazepine, diazepam, served as a reference standard for LY288513 in many of the tests. In the elevated plus-maze, LY288513 (3, 10 mg/kg, IP; 10, 30 mg/kg, PO) produced an anxiolytic-like action in mice with a magnitude of effect similar to that of diazepam. However, unlike diazepam, LY288513 produced no overt clinical signs and did not affect muscle tone, neuromuscular coordination, or sensorimotor reactivity. Also, in contrast to diazepam, LY288513 did not produce changes in the thresholds for electroshock- or pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions. High doses of LY288513 (1000 mg/kg, PO) were required to reduce spontaneous activity levels, decrease body temperature, or potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of hexobarbital. LY288513 had no analgesic activity in mouse writhing or tail-flick tests. Electrophysiological studies in anesthetized rats showed that acute administration of LY288513 decreased the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. However, LY288513 did not produce catalepsy. These data indicate that LY288513 possess both anxiolytic and antipsychotic potential.", 
    "58": "The effects of repeated administration of diazepam, MK-801 and CGP 37849 on rat behavior in the Vogel conflict test, and in the open field test of neophobia, were studied in rats. The drugs were given at doses active acutely, for 5 days, the last dose was administered 30 or 60 min prior to testing. It appeared that diazepam and MK-801 treated animals showed clear-cut signs of behavioral tolerance and motor sensitization, respectively. CGP 37849 was characterized by the best pharmacological profile, in that on repeated administration the drug not only retained its anxiolytic-like potency in the Vogel test, but even enhanced rat exploratory behavior in a new environment, independently of changes in animal motor activity. Repeated injections of the examined agents did not cause any significant modifications in monoamine levels and their turnover rates, in the striatum and limbic forebrain. It is concluded that the new class of competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, exemplified by CGP 37849, is the most promising candidate for clinical trials in anxiety disorders.", 
    "59": "1. The ability of olanzapine to inhibit the metabolism of marker catalytic activities for the cytochromes P450 CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was examined. This inhibitory capability was compared with that obtained with clozapine and known inhibitory compounds for the same cytochromes P450. 2. Olanzapine, clozapine, and ketoconazole were all found to non-competitively inhibit 1'-hydroxy midazolam formation, form selective for CYP3A, yielding Ki values of 491, 99 and 0.11 microM, respectively. The 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol, form selective for CYP2D6, was competitively inhibited by olanzapine (Ki = 89 microM), clozapine (Ki = 19 microM), and quinidine (Ki = 0.03 microM). Tolbutamide metabolism to 4-hydroxy tolbutamide, form selective for CYP2C9, was competitively inhibited by clozapine and phenytoin (Ki of 31 microM and 17 microM, respectively). Olanzapine non-competitively inhibited tolbutamide metabolism with a Ki of 715 microM. The marker catalytic activity for CYP2C19 mediated metabolism, 4'-hydroxy S-mephenytoin formation, was competitively inhibited by clozapine (Ki = 69 microM) and omeprazole (Ki = 4.1 microM). Non-competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 mediated metabolism was seen with olanzapine with a Ki of 920 microM. 3. The calculated percent inhibition by olanzapine of substrates metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was modeled assuming a total plasma concentration in the therapeutic range (0.2 microM). Total olanzapine vs unbound olanzapine was used to model the worst case (most conservative) situation. In all cases, the calculated percent inhibition of these cytochromes P450 by olanzapine was < 0.3%, suggesting that there would be little in vivo inhibition of the metabolism of substrates of these enzymes when co-administered with olanzapine.", 
    "60": "Peripheral-type benzodiazephine receptors (PBR) are involved in steroidogenesis and are sensitive to stress. Reduced platelet PBR density has been demonstrated in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but not in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We extended this observation to another anxiety disorder, namely, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Eighteen post-Persian Gulf War PTSD patients and 17 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the study. All subjects were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient Version. The severity of symptoms was assessed using the DSM-III-R scale for PTSD, the Impact of Event Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. [3H]PK 11195 was used to label platelet PBR. All psychological parameters (except trait anxiety) were higher in PTSD patients compared to controls. Decreased platelet PBR density (-62%; p < .001) was observed in the PTSD patients compared to controls. The reduction in PBR observed in PTSD patients was in accordance with the findings in GAD patients, but differed from those obtained in OCD patients. It is possible that the receptoral downregulation is an adaptive response aimed at preventing chronic overproduction of glucocorticoids in hyperarousal states.", 
    "61": "This article reviews governmental guidelines regulating the use of psychotropic drugs in long-term care facilities as established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987 and their impact on the use of psychotropic agents in these settings. A major component of these guidelines is to regulate the clinical indications for psychoactive drugs (neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, and sedative hypnotics) in residents of long-term care facilities. Responsibilities of the prescribing physician, facility medical director, and consulting pharmacist--as well as quality assurance procedures-in complying with OBRA regulations are examined. Evidence that OBRA regulations have reduced the use of psychotropic drugs and physical restraints in long-term nursing facilities is reviewed. Implications of the OBRA regulations for the training and clinical practice of psychiatrists and primary care clinicians are discussed as well as recommendations for increasing the availability of mental health services for this patient population via multidisciplinary geropsychiatric consultation-liaison teams.",

    "64": "Because few well-controlled studies are available in aggression research, all literature addressing the pharmacologic treatment of aggressive behavior, as well as the neurochemistry and psychobiology of aggressive behavior, was reviewed.", 
    "65": "The literature was reviewed on the basis of the particular pharmacotherapy and the specific population used. A separate review of the treatment of aggressive behavior in the elderly was included.", 
    "66": "The literature was assessed for applicability to clinical practice and usefulness to the general clinician. Recommendations were made from the primary literature in conjunction with trends in clinical practice. Pharmacotherapy is a primary mainstay of treatment for aggressive patients. In individuals for whom behavioral intervention alone is unsuccessful, drug therapy should be initiated along with continued nonpharmacologic intervention. Short-acting benzodiazepines and high-potency antipsychotic agents are effective in treating acute aggression on a short-term or as needed basis. Agents such as lithium, beta adrenergic blockers, carbamazepine, valproic acid, buspirone, trazodone, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and clozapine may be useful in the chronic management of aggressive behavior. Every attempt should be made to streamline drug therapy in patients with chronic aggression and comorbid psychiatric disorders.", 
    "67": "On the basis of available research and extensive clinical experience, lithium or propranolol should be considered as first-line antiaggressive agents in patients without comorbid psychiatric disorders. A minimum trial period for assessing drug efficacy should last at least 6-8 weeks at maximum tolerated dosages. Patients responding to pharmacotherapy should be reevaluated every 3-6 months, and periodic medication tapers and/or drug-free periods should be attempted.", 
    "68": "Pre-clinical and some clinical evidence suggests that central overdrive within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may play a role in panic disorder, and that the anti-panic efficacy of alprazolam may involve its ability to inhibit this drive. Detailed examination of 24 h secretion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol in 20 panic patients had revealed subtle HPA axis abnormalities prior to treatment. In order to determine whether these abnormalities resolve with alprazolam therapy, these patients were re-studied over a full circadian cycle after 12 weeks on alprazolam. Alprazolam produced substantial improvement in clinical status which was accompanied by nearly full resolution of pre-treatment hypercortisolemia. The impact of treatment on ACTH was more complex and influenced by symptom severity. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that HPA axis regulation is subtly disturbed in panic disorder and that impact on the HPA axis may play a role in alprazolam's mechanism of efficacy.", 
    "69": "Synaptic plasma membranes were prepared from four cerebrocortical areas from six male Angora goats made chronically thiamine deficient (TD) by the administration of AmproliumTM (600-900 mg/kg daily for 38-44 d). Four male controls were matched for age (27-30 mo). Four different radioligands were used to characterise GABAA and Glu-RNMDA receptor binding sites. There were marked, localised and contrasting changes in motor cortex, with an increase in GABAA and a decrease in Glu-RNMDA binding site densities. Less clearcut changes of a similar nature were seen in visual cortex. There was no variation in the parameters of GABA-activated [3H]diazepam binding between cortical areas in control goats, but there was a reduction in the maximal response to GABA in all areas in TD goats. There were regional variations in glutamate-activated [3H]MK-801 binding in control goat brain, and a non-selectively reduced maximal response in TD. Alterations in these indices of GABA- and glutamate-mediated neurotransmission may underlie the neurological signs of acute thiamine deficiency in these animals.", 
    "70": "Recent reports indicate that benzodiazepines can suppress melatonin levels and that melatonin can increase brain benzodiazepine binding. We have studied the possibility of reciprocal effects of chronic diazepam and melatonin on brain melatonin and benzodiazepine binding sites. Daily injections (3 weeks) of diazepam markedly reduced 125I-melatonin binding site density in the medulla-pons but not cortex of male rats, whereas benzodiazepine binding was not significantly affected. Melatonin, administered via the drinking water, significantly enhanced benzodiazepine (3H-RO 15-1788) binding in the medulla-pons and slightly reduced it in the cortex, but did not affect 125I-melatonin binding. Diazepam and melatonin combination reversed the suppression by diazepam of 125I-melatonin binding in the medulla-pons and the suppression by melatonin of benzodiazepine (3H-RO 15-1788 and 3H-flunitrazepam) binding in the cerebral cortex. These results indicate benzodiazepine-mediated suppression of brain melatonin binding sites that can be abrogated by melatonin administration.", 
    "71": "Owing to the clinical similarity between the male climacteric syndrome and the results of previous studies on the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in relation to sex hormones, we hypothesized that alcoholics with a poor supply of testosterone will develop more pronounced symptoms during alcohol withdrawal than alcoholics with high levels of testosterone. Fifty-two male alcoholics were studied. To test our hypothesis we entered the mean values of the hormones, the mean age, and the mean consumption of liquor (CL) the week before admittance as regressors in a multiple forward stepwise regression analysis with four subclass constructed from the CPRS as dependent variables. Our results indicate that patients with low levels of testosterone develop more neurotic-asthenic symptoms, such as indecision, worrying about trifles, fatigability, and lassitude during alcohol withdrawal. Further, high levels of SHBG were related to a history of seizures and younger alcoholics received higher ratings on the paranoid-aggressive subscale. It is concluded that there is a relation between levels of testosterone and symptoms during alcohol withdrawal. The question of a causal relationship remains to be answered, however. One way to illuminate this would be to add testosterone during detoxification, which may reduce the symptoms mentioned above analogous to the male climacteric syndrome, which could be prosperously treated by a supplement of testosterone. This treatment strategy would have obvious advantages compared to benzodiazepine detoxification as such drugs are potentially addictive.", 
    "72": "The influence of increased endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations on benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) function was studied in the living baboon brain. By using positron emission tomography and the radiotracer [11C] flumazenil combined with electroencephalography, the anticonvulsant/proconvulsant activity and the potency of the BZR agonist diazepam and the inverse agonist methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), a beta-carboline, were determined in baboons pretreated or not with 500mg/kg of vigabatrin (irreversible inhibitor of the GABA-aminotransferase which increases GABA concentrations in vivo). Pretreatment with vigabatrin increased the threshold of paroxysmal pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure. In both vigabatrin-treated and -untreated animals, the threshold dose of pentylenetetrazol increased with increasing doses of diazepam; it decreased with increasing doses of beta-CCM. The proconvulsant activity of beta-CCM was at all doses reduced in vigabatrin-treated animals compared to untreated animals, whereas, surprisingly, the anticonvulsant activity of high doses of diazepam was reduced after vigabatrin. The potency of diazepam in displacing [11C] flumazenil was enhanced in vigabatrin-pretreated animals, contrasting with the reduced anticonvulsant effects of diazepam in those animals. We determined the linear relationship between the fractional receptor occupancy and the anticonvulsant/proconvulsant effect. The slope, an estimate of the intrinsic efficacy of a BZR ligand, was reduced markedly for diazepam after vigabatrin pretreatment, whereas that for beta-CCM was unmodified. This indicates that increasing GABA levels in vivo reduce the anticonvulsant activity of the BZR agonist diazepam by decreasing its intrinsic efficacy, whereas the intrinsic efficacy of the inverse agonist beta-CCM remains essentially unaltered.", 
    "73": "The present study was conducted to localize and characterize the subtype(s) of muscarinic receptor involved in prostacyclin production elicited by the cholinergic transmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in various cell types in the rabbit heart. ACh increased prostacyclin synthesis, measured as 6-keto-prostaglandin(1 alpha) (6-keto-PGF(1 alpha)), in cultured coronary endothelial cells and freshly dissociated ventricular myocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but not in cultured coronary smooth muscle cells of rabbit heart. McN-A-343 {(4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)-1-trimethylammonium-m-chlorocarbanilate chloride}, a selective M1 muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) agonist, did not alter 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) synthesis in these cell types. ACh induced 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) synthesis in coronary endothelial cells and ventricular myocytes was not altered by a low concentration (0.01 microM) of pirenzepine, an M1 mAChR antagonist, but was reduced by a higher concentration (1 microM). In coronary endothelial cells, ACh-induced 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) production was reduced by hexahydrosila-difendial (HHSiD), an M3 mAChR antagonist, and in ventricular myocytes by both AF-DX 116 [11-{2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido[2,3-b]-benzodiazepine-6 one}], an M2 receptor antagonist, and HHSiD. The decrease by ACh of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was minimized by AF-DX 116, but not by HHSiD or pirenzepine. Pertussis toxin treatment minimized ACh-induced decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated rise in cAMP, but not ACh-induced 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) synthesis. These data suggest that ACh stimulates prostacyclin production in coronary endothelial cells via M3 mAChR and in ventricular myocytes via M2 and M3 mAChR, and may contribute to its cardioprotective effects. Moreover, ACh induced decrease in cAMP, but not the increase in 6-keto-PGF (1 alpha) production, is mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G(alpha i) proteins in these cells.", 
    "74": "By using the baculovirus expression system, we report decreases in allosteric coupling at individual gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor subtypes (alpha-1, beta-2 and gamma-2, alpha-2, beta-3 and gamma-2 and alpha-5, beta-3 and gamma-2) after chronic benzodiazepine exposure that replicate coupling changes measured in rat cortical membranes after in vivo benzodiazepine exposure. The appearance of uncoupling was time-dependent and the magnitude of uncoupling at expressed GABA(A) receptor subtypes after chronic exposure was dependent upon the efficacy of the ligand in a subtype-specific manner. In addition, the expression of uncoupling was not accompanied by changes in benzodiazepine receptor number or affinity at any expressed GABA(A) subtype examined. The specificity of the coupling change was further shown by the ability of a brief exposure to the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro15-1788, to reverse the uncoupling induced by chronic benzodiazepine exposure. These findings suggest that alterations at the GABA(A) receptor complex after chronic benzodiazepine exposure are mediated directly by agonist effects at the GABA(A) receptor complex and are not the product of the changes in the surrounding neuronal environment. Furthermore, the present study shows that drug efficacy, and not simply affinity, plays a critical role in determining the degree of uncoupling, and perhaps, in the development of tolerance and dependence.", 
    "75": "Atypical anxiolytics such buspirone have been reported to produce fewer disruptive effects on complex behaviors than some typical anxiolytics from the benzodiazepine class. To extend this analysis, several drugs from both drug classes were directly compared in two species (rhesus monkeys and rats) using a repeated-acquisition procedure. In monkeys responding under a multiple schedule of reinforcement consisting of acquisition (learning) and performance components, buspirone (0.032-0.52 mg/kg), 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT;0.032-0-56 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (CDZP; 1-56 mg/kg) and alprazolam (0.032-0.32 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in overall response rate in all subjects. However, with buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT, these rate-decreasing effects occurred in acquisition at lower doses than in performance. The effects on overall accuracy (i.e., percent errors) in monkeys were variable across drugs and drug classes. Both 8-OH-DPAT and alprazolam produced large increases in percent errors in acquisition at doses that had little or no effect on errors in performance. Buspirone also had differential effects on percent errors across components, but the error-increasing effects in acquisition were smaller. CDZP administered either orally or intramuscularly produced only small increases in errors, and these occurred at doses that substantially decreased the overall rate of responding in both components of the multiple schedule. In rats responding under a repeated-acquisition procedure, buspirone (1-5.6 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (0.056-3.2 mg/kg) and CDZP (1.8-32 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in overall response rate. Similar to acquisition data in monkeys, buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT also increased percent errors to a greater extent than CDZP. These data indicate that learning is sensitive to disruption by drugs with 5-HT1A agonist properties, and that atypical anxiolytics with 5-HT1A agonist properties are no less disruptive to \"cognitive\" processes than typical anxiolytics such as the benzodiazepine alprazolam.", 
    "76": "Benzodiazepine drugs (BZ) are used for anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. They worsen memory, especially in large doses, but the mechanism of this action is uncertain. In micromolar concentrations, benzodiazepines have been shown to reduce long-term potentiation (LTP), which could be a cellular basis for their amnesic action. We have found that the LTP-inhibiting effects of BZ occur in the nanomolar concentrations attained in humans, and that this effect occurs through modulation of GABAA receptor function. We recorded extracellular synaptic input/output (I/O) curves for population spikes (PS) and EPSPs in rat hippocampal slices before and after induction of LTP. LTP increased maximal PS and EPSPs and shifted I/O curves for PS and EPSPs to the left, reflecting increased synaptic responsiveness after LTP. Curves relating EPSPs to PS were also shifted, so that after LTP larger PS were elicited for the same size EPSP (E-S potentiation). Midazolam (0.5 microM) markedly inhibited the left-shift in PS I/O curves due to E-S potentiation but did not significantly affect other parameters. 8-Phenyltheophylline (10 microM), an adenosine receptor antagonist, did not prevent midazolam inhibition of LTP. Bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, caused a dose-dependent antagonism of midazolam's LTP inhibition. Our results suggest that benzodiazepines reduce LTP primarily through reduction of E-S potentiation, and that this effect occurs through modulation of GABAA receptor function. This could in part account for the ability of benzodiazepines to disturb new memory formation.", 
    "77": "Patient-administered nitrous oxide in 50% oxygen has lately come into use as an alternative to combined opioid and benzodiazepine medication for colonoscopic procedures. A randomized study was carried out comparing intramuscular pethidine hydrochloride 1 mg/kg with inhalation of Medimix (a mixture of nitrous oxide in oxygen 50%) for relief of pain and anxiety during colonoscopy.", 
    "78": "Thirty-eight patients (19 in the pethidine group and 19 in the nitrous oxide group) were studied. The following parameters were measured: blood pressure, pulse rate, and arterial oxygen saturation. At the end of the colonoscopy and before the patients left the ward, pain, nausea, and general well-being were evaluated by the patients using a visual analogue scale. The colonoscopy time, investigation conditions and the total length of hospital stay were registered.", 
    "79": "Colonoscopy time and the colonoscopists' opinions concerning the investigation conditions did not differ between the groups. Pain relief and patient evaluation of the total procedure were also equal between the patient groups. However, there was less nausea among the Medimix patients. Three patients in the pethidine group had oxygen saturations below 92%. There was no desaturation during and five minutes after colonoscopy in the Medimix group. Patients in the Medimix group left the hospital on average 34 minutes earlier than patients in the pethidine group.", 
    "80": "We conclude that the use of nitrous oxide (Medimix) as an analgesic is as good as pethidine for colonoscopy. Medimix has clear advantages compared to pethidine in terms of reducing nausea and shortening the hospital stay.", 
    "81": "The use of sedation in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is widespread, mainly because of the belief that patients are likely to tolerate the procedure better. The aim of the present study was to assess patients' response to the policy of actively persuading them to accept a throat spray for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.", 
    "82": "Three hundred patients who had recently undergone endoscopy were sent a questionnaire; 244 of them responded (81%). Data on age, sex, procedure tolerance, anxiety levels, and future choice of sedation or throat spray for repeat procedures were sought. The results were analysed using the chi-squared test.", 
    "83": "One hundred and ninety-two (79%) chose, or were persuaded to have, throat spray, and only nine (5%) had to be transferred to sedation. Thirty-two percent of patients who had throat spray tolerated endoscopy well, compared to 70% of those who chose sedation. One hundred and nineteen throat spray patients (62%) showed a low level of reluctance to undergo repeat endoscopy, compared to 37 (71%) sedated patients (not significant). One hundred and forty-four throat spray patients (76%) expressed satisfaction with the throat spray, but if given a choice, only 124 (66%) would choose throat spray again. Male patients, those with lower anxiety levels, and those over 50 years old, tolerated endoscopy with throat spray better, showed less reluctance to undergo repeat endoscopy, and were more likely to choose throat spray again. Those who had any previous experience of endoscopy under sedation were less likely to choose throat spray again.", 
    "84": "The present study shows that the use of throat spray for diagnostic endoscopy is quite acceptable to patients. For safety reasons, we should be encouraging greater use of throat spray in routine diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.", 
    "85": "Catatonic syndromes are seen in diverse psychiatric and systemic illnesses, and may have varied presentations. Although reports suggest that benzodiazepines are helpful, debate persists regarding definitive treatment for catatonia. We present a case in which electroconvulsive therapy effectively resolved symptoms in an adolescent patient with catatonia who had only a transient response to lorazepam.", 
    "86": "The benzodiazepines diazepam and midazolam at submicromolar concentrations potentiated the increase in free cytosolic calcium concentration in astrocytes in primary cultures evoked by an elevation of the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]0), but they had little stimulatory effect at normal [K+]0 and none at maximally elevated [K+]0. Nifedipine, an inhibitor of the L-channel, counteracted both the effect of the elevated [K+]0 as such and the benzodiazepine modulation. PK 11195, an antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, counteracted the effect of the benzodiazepines, but had no effect on the increase in free cytosolic calcium evoked by the elevated [K+]0.", 
    "87": "We studied whether microtubule organization is important for actions of ethanol on GABAA ergic responses by testing the effects of microtubule depolymerization on ethanol enhancement of GABA action in mouse L(tk-) cells stably transfected with GABAA receptor alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L subunits. The microtubule-disrupting agents colchicine, taxol, and vinblastine completely blocked ethanol-induced enhancement of muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake. beta-Lumicolchicine, a colchicine analogue that does not disrupt microtubules, had no effect on ethanol action. Colchicin did not alter the potentiating actions of flunitrazeparn or pentobarbital on muscimol-stimulated chloride uptakes. Thus, colchicine specifically inhibited the potentiating action of ethanol. From these findings, we conclude that intact microtubules are required for ethanol-induced enhancement of GABAA responses and suggest that a mechanism involving microtubules produces posttranslational modifications that are necessary for ethanol sensitivity in this cell system.", 
    "88": "This study looks into patterns of benzodiazepine prescription for patients attending a primary health care setting. Fifty one general practitioners and nurses were involved in the project. Information was recorded over a week, four times a year. In total, there was information available on 571 patients. Patients receiving benzodiazepine treatment tended to be females (68.5 per cent), aged over 40 (84 per cent), married (63.8 per cent) and with primary education level (77.1 per cent). Most patients received long acting (48 per cent) or short acting (36.7 per cent) benzodiazepine treatment. In 46 per cent of the cases the treatment was longer than one year. Benzodiazepines were prescribed for anxiety (44.8 per cent), insomnia (23.8 per cent) and depression (10.1 per cent). The study showed the need to improve rational prescription of these drugs.", 
    "89": "A 63-year-old man had recurrent spontaneous attacks of consciousness disturbance without toxic, metabolic, or structural brain damage. Interictal electroencephalography showed 14 Hz spindle wave-like activity; ictal electroencephalography revealed faster basic activity. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, promptly resolved the attacks. The endogenous benzodiazepine-like activities in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (measured in the courtesy of P. Schoch Ph. D, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) increased in the interictal period and increased more strikingly in the ictal period. These findings and the clinical effects of flumazenil suggest an involvement of an endogenous benzodiazepine-like activity in the pathogenesis of the attacks in this patient, as same as in a case reported by Tinuper et al (1992).",

O+D patients were randomised to receive ondansetron 8 mg intravenously (i.v.) plus dexamethasone 20 mg i.v. prior to cisplatin (50-100 mg/m2) chemotherapy. On the following 4 days they were treated with ondansetron 8 mg bd orally and dexamethasone 4 mg bd orally. M + D + L patients were randomised to receive metoclopramide 3 mg/kg i.v., dexamethasone 20 mg i.v. and lorazepam 1.5 mg/m2 i.v. (max 3 mg) prior to cisplatin chemotherapy and a further dose of metoclopramide 3 mg/kg i.v. approximately 2 hours following the first dose of metoclopramide. Treatment for the following 4 days was metoclopramide 40 mg tds and dexamethasone 4 mg bd orally.

This was maintained over the three treatment cycles; 38% of O + D and 20% of M + D + L patients remained free of emesis (P = 0.003). Maintenance of control of nausea grade as none or mild on days 1-5 over the three courses was significantly better in the O + D group (48%) than in the M + D + L (26%, P = 0.003). The most commonly occurring adverse events in the O + D group were constipation (25%) and headache (19%). In the M + D + L group drowsiness (38% of patients), malaise/fatigue (16% of patients), constipation (13% of patients), anxiety (11% of patients) and dizziness (10% of patients) were the most commonly reported adverse events. Extrapyramidal symptoms were reported by 20% of patients in the M + D + L group. Despite the inclusion of lorazepam, 14% of patients in the M + D + L group were withdrawn from the study due to extrapyramidal symptoms, which in the opinion of the investigators, were probably or almost certainly related to study medication.",

    "94": "A clinical sample of 55 patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder (PD) were enrolled in this long-term study. The patients were treated initially with alprazolam or imipramine during a period of 9 weeks. A clinical psychiatric examination was carried out at the beginning and at the end of the initial treatment period and 3 and 6 years after the enrollment. Although most of the patients (74%) had no panic attacks at the end of the 6-year follow-up period, 9 (18%) had major depression and 6 (11%) severe suicidality. Seven of these depressive patients also suffered from alcoholism. Sixty per cent of the patients were still on medication at the end of the follow-up. Depression, suicidality and alcoholism seem to be the long-term consequences of PD.", 
    "95": "It is unclear whether elevated cholesterol level is a complication of panic disorder (PD) or is associated with pharmacotherapy. We compared the total cholesterol (TC) level in 47 PD patients with that in 47 gender- and age-matched normal controls (NC), and we also examined the pre- and post-treatment TC levels. There was no sex difference in TC. Before pharmacotherapy, the mean TC level in the PD group (194.9 +/- 39.6 mg/dl) was non-significantly higher than that in the NC group (190.5 +/- 26.7 mg/dl). The mean TC level in the PD group was significantly reduced following the pharmacotherapy (post-TC: 184.7 +/- 31.0 mg/dl; t = 2.44, P < 0.02), and the subgroup treated with alprazolam (n = 26) showed markedly significant decrease of TC after the treatment (t = 2.36, P < 0.03). The TC level in the PD subgroup with agoraphobia (n = 24, 198.9 +/- 37.9 mg/dl) was slightly higher than that in the group without agoraphobia (n = 23, 190.8 +/- 41.6 mg/dl). These findings suggest that there is a relationship between cholesterol levels and treatment in PD.", 
    "96": "The bicyclams represent a new class of highly potent and selective HIV inhibitors. Time-of-addition experiments have previously shown that these compounds interfere with an early event in the viral replicative cycle. Additional experiments have now been carried out in order to investigate in more detail the mechanism of action of these promising compounds. As described in this paper, PCR experiments revealed that no viral DNA was formed following viral infection, thus confining the target(s) of action of the bicyclams to an early stage of HIV infection. An assay, using pseudotype virions containing the envelope of HIV-1 and the genome of a plaque-forming virus (Cocal Virus), pointed to viral entry as the main target of the bicyclams. HIV-1 strains resistant to two prototype bicyclams, JM2763 and SID791 (JM3100), were raised. Results obtained with SID791 with respect to syncytium formation induced by SID791-sensitive and -resistant HIV-1 strains and the cross-resistance observed for dextran sulfate, suggest inhibition of binding and/or fusion as a plausible target of SID791. Additional experiments enabled us to exclude SID791 and JM2763 as binding inhibitors and to conclude that bicyclams block the entry of cell-bound virus. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody recognising the V3 loop of wild-type gp120 did not bind to this region in the two bicyclam-resistant strains. Our results point to gp120 as a possible target for the HIV-inhibitory effects of the bicyclams.", 
    "97": "A sensitive HPLC assay for measurement of the antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, in plasma has been developed. The assay has a limit of quantitation of 1 ng ml-1 in plasma and utilizes solid-phase extraction and electrochemical detection. The method provides a linear response for olanzapine over a concentration range of 1-100 ng ml-1 with coefficients of determination greater than 0.9912. The inter-assay precision was 15.9% at the limit of detection and ranged from 7.33% to 8.47% over the range of 5-100 ng ml-1. The intra-assay precision was in the range 0.97%-26.0%. The inter-assay accuracy ranged from 98.9 to 118% and the intra-assay accuracy ranged from 92.5% to 125% of the theoretical value. In addition, the assay was extended to measure the plasma levels of two metabolites of olanzapine, namely the N-desmethyl- and the 2-hydroxymethyl analogs. The utility of the assay was demonstrated following the administration of a single oral dose of 14C-olanzapine to rats where, at several time-points after dosing, the plasma was assayed for total radioactivity, levels of olanzapine, and the two metabolites. Olanzapine and two of its metabolites accounted for less than 50% of the total plasma radiocarbon; olanzapine accounting for approximately 39% at the Cmax, N-desmethyl for 5% and 2-hydroxymethyl for 8% respectively. The plasma elimination half-times for olanzapine and the two metabolites were approximately the same, ranging from 3.3 to 4.4 h.", 
    "98": "The pleasant subjective effects produced by alcohol undoubtedly reinforce drinking behaviour. Alcohol positively reinforces or rewards drinking by producing a mild euphoria. Alcohol also has anxiolytic effects that negatively reinforce drinking. The reinforcing effects of alcohol are mediated by several neurochemical systems, with dopamine and serotonin playing major roles in reward and the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor system playing a major role in negative reinforcement. Research from our laboratory suggests that the behavioural effects of alcohol change when blood alcohol levels are changing and that these changes correspond to alterations of specific neurochemical systems. Behavioural activation and reward effects appear to occur as blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) increase. Depressive and aversive effects of alcohol occur during the period when BACs decrease. The observed correlation between behavioural and neuropharmacological changes and alcohol consumption suggest that alcohol produces a unique cascade over time that may provide clues to its long-sought specific mechanisms of action. In alcohol-dependent individuals, chronic exposure to alcohol may alter the function and communication between the liver, brain and other vital organ systems involved in hunger and the maintenance of nutrition. Under such conditions, the importance of alcohol in the diet may be enhanced such that hunger signals in the alcohol-dependent individual motivate the consumption of alcohol. Therefore, hunger for alcohol may provide an additional source of reinforcement. Endogenous opioid mechanisms may be important in this form of alcohol reinforcement.", 
    "99": "Several approaches have been employed for the treatment of dystonias. Possible specific causes should be searched for and specific treatment should be instituted. Different types of symptomatic treatment are grouped according to the following categories: pharmacological systemic therapy, surgical therapy and botulinum toxin injections in the affected muscles. Each of these approaches has its advantages and limitations. Generalized dystonias should be treated with anticholinergic agents. In some cases, levodopa or other drugs such as dopamine antagonists, baclofen and benzodiazepines should be preferred. Focal dystonias respond dramatically to local injections of botulinum toxin. Over 90% of patients with blepharospasm and 70% of patients with cervical dystonia present a satisfactory response to this procedure. Surgical approaches have been utilized in some cases of generalized (stereotaxic lesions), axial (rhizotomies) and focal dystonias (myectomies and neurectomies) with variable results.", 
    "100": "In the mammalian labyrinth, GABAA receptor subtypes are involved in the excitatory neurotransmission between the vestibular type II hair cells and the afferent neurons. Additional afferent ionophoric receptor channels, sensitive to further transmitter candidates, are discussed for both types I and II hair cells. GABA accelerates excitotoxic cell death in cortical neurons. This GABA-ergic neurotoxic action forms an appropriate pathophysiological model explaining peripheral labyrinthine disorders characterized by the spontaneous labyrinthine nystagmus and vertigo in man. A calculated GABAA receptor antagonism was envisaged in order to attenuate the pathological vestibular imbalance following one-sided GABA-accelerated vestibular neurotoxicity. Moderate allosteric blockers of the GABAA receptor channel and weak inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine binding site meet some requirements for potentially successful clinical application. The suppressing action of the suitable drugs picrotoxin and flumazenil on labyrinthine nystagmus and vertigo, tested in clinical trials, supports the hypothesis that GABAA receptors are involved in vestibular neurotransmission, even in humans. The test results promise the development of a successful vestibular receptorpharmacology in the near future.",

    "111": "Applying the principle and equipment of patient-controlled analgesia, this double-blind randomised study was designed to determine the premedication dose of midazolam and to provide information about the need for preoperative anxiety control. The effects of patient-controlled premedication by i.v. midazolam were compared to those of a 1-hour i.v. infusion of a fixed dose of 4 mg. Two groups of 25 patients were studied prior to ambulatory surgery. Using a visual analogue scale graded from 0 (no anxiety) to 100, anxiety and short-term memory as well as vital signs, vigilance, cognition and orientation were assessed before premedication and then every 20 min until admission to the operating room. In both groups, 40% of the patients were free of anxiety before premedication. Sixty-four percent of patients in the self-pre-medicated group never used the pump. The dose of midazolam was only 0.7 0.2 mg (mean SD) in this group taken as a whole, 0.7, 1.1 mg (mean SD) in the 8 patients who had an anxiety score at least equal to 50 before premedication, and 1.7 0.3 mg (mean SD) in the 9 patients who chose to push the button of the patient-controlled device. Anxiety and short-term memory scores decreased significantly and similarly in the self-premedicated group and in the fixed-dose group. For similar intraoperative anaesthetic requirements, time from the end of anaesthesia for determining whether a patient was ready for admission to the postrecovery lounge was shorter in the self-premedicated group (26 +/- 8 min vs 32 +/- 8 min; mean +/- SD. Reduced doses of midazolam self-administered via a patient-controlled device can result in a relaxed preoperative period and amnesia in ambulatory surgery patients. However, the level of anxiety before premedication was low, which calls into question the legitimacy of the patient-controlled premedication in this kind of population. The expense of the pump was not justified by the small number of patients using it, probably because they were worried by the technical nature and the invasiveness of this technique.", 
    "112": "Stress hormone response was investigated during midazolam/fentanyl/oxygen/air anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia in six patients undergoing abdominal total hysterectomy (group MF). A control group of six patients received nitrous oxide/oxygen/sevoflurane anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia (group C). We evaluated plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, aldosterone and beta-endorphin during the control period, 10 min, 60 min after incision, and in the recovery room. In group C, plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, aldosterone and beta-endorphin increased significantly 60 min after incision compared with control concentrations. But in group MF, they did not increase significantly during anesthesia. In the recovery room there were significant differences compared with preinduction concentrations in both groups. It is concluded that midazolam/fentanyl anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia is more effective than nitrous oxide/oxygen/sevoflurane anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia to control the stress response to surgery.", 
    "113": "A positive control study was conducted as part of the ongoing validation program for developmental neurotoxicity testing in our laboratory using a standard battery of automated systems, consisting of rotorod, motor activity, acoustic startle, and two-way active avoidance. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were given 10 mg/kg diazepam (DZ) by SC injection or 20 mg/kg methimazole (MET) by gavage from gestation day 15 (DZ) or 17 (MET) through postpartum day 10; a group of control animals remained untreated. Offspring were assessed for growth, survival, developmental landmarks, and behavior. Although this study was considered useful for obtaining historical data, it offered few advantages in terms of validation of automated behavior test systems. Perinatal treatment with DZ resulted in no maternal toxicity and no adverse effects on growth or development of F1 offspring; a deficit in acoustic startle responding was the only behavioral effect observed. Treatment with MET resulted in maternal toxicity, reduced neonatal body weights, and developmental delays. Behavioral effects included impaired rotorod performance and acoustic startle responding (neonates), and enhanced motor activity and acoustic startle responding (young adults). However, effects on shuttle avoidance were not observed for either drug, and only one direction of behavioral effect occurred for the rotorod and motor activity systems. These results, as well as those from subsequent studies in our laboratory, suggest that it may be preferable to validate automated behavior systems using short-term studies in which young adult animals are treated directly with positive control agents.", 
    "114": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate in a randomized, double-blinded fashion the sedative and behavioral responses of children undergoing pediatric dental procedures as outpatients and who had received a combination of either oral chloral hydrate 50 mg/kg, not to exceed 1 gm, with hydroxyzine 25 mg (Group 1); or oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg with acetaminophen elixir 10 mg/kg (Group 2). The children were rated according to sleep, movement, crying and overall behavior at preselected intervals that included presedation, introduction to the operating suite, injection, and overall behavior. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in regards to age, weight, length of procedure, or sex. Group 1 was more asleep in the later time intervals (P < 0.05). Their were no statistically significant differences between the groups in relation to the overall evaluation for the procedure.

Twenty-five healthy, uncooperative children, mean age 3 years 8 months (+/- 1 year 3 months), requiring at least three visits for the treatment of dental caries, were studied. Each child's behaviour was assessed during three treatment sessions: (i) control, with no diazepam or placebo; (ii) with diazepam; and (iii) with a placebo. Each child acted as his/her own control, being initially assigned to the control session. Subsequently each was randomly assigned to receive either diazepam or placebo for the second session and the other for the third session. The diazepam and placebo were administered by the parents at home approximately 60 minutes before treatment. Each patient's behaviour was assessed on a scale of 1 (definitely positive) to 4 (definitely negative) by two calibrated examiners who were blind to the medications given and independent of the treatment. Vital signs were monitored at 5-minute intervals. Behaviour was significantly better with diazepam than with the placebo or with neither. No significant differences were observed between the placebo and control sessions. At no time were any adverse effects noted, such as vomiting or respiratory depression.

The test set comprised the same subjects on subsequent visits, in which the subjects received a continuous infusion of midazolam to maintain 20% or 80% of the peak drug effect for 3h. Twenty minutes after start of the midazolam infusion, the patient received an infusion of flumazenil to acutely reverse the benzodiazepine drug effect.

The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was administered in a multicenter study to detoxified alcohol-dependent patients (N = 521). The objectives of the study were to evaluate (1) the expression of the three personality dimensions, novelty-seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), and reward dependence (RD), of the TPQ in this sample, and (2) the influence of different variables on these personality dimensions. The following variables were selected for a multiple and a stepwise regression analysis: sex, family history for major psychiatric disorders, marital status, occupation, age at study enrollment, age of onset of alcoholism, serum cholesterol level, intake of neuroleptics or benzodiazepines for detoxification, and severity of depression and anxiety. In comparison to Austrian normative data, both sexes of detoxified alcohol addicts scored higher in HA. The variables examined explain 23% of the variance of NS and 35% of HA. Only one variable, namely age of onset, is significantly influencing NS (19% explained variance). HA is significantly influenced by three variables: anxiety state, anxiety trait, and sex (32% explained variance). RD is not influenced by any of the variables examined."
