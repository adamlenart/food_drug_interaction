The authors present treatment response and remission outcomes at 9 months postpartum using a four-step algorithm in patients with first-onset psychosis or mania in the postpartum period. Treatment involved the structured sequential administration of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, lithium, and ECT. The outcome of clinical remission was examined in 64 women consecutively admitted for postpartum psychosis. Remission was defined as the absence of psychotic, manic, and severe depressive symptoms for at least 1 week. Women who remitted on antipsychotic monotherapy were advised to continue this treatment as maintenance therapy, and women who required both antipsychotics and lithium to achieve remission were maintained on lithium monotherapy. Relapse was defined as the occurrence of any mood or psychotic episode fulfilling DSM-IV-TR criteria. Using this treatment algorithm, the authors observed that nearly all patients (98.4%) achieved complete remission within the first three steps. None of the patients required ECT. At 9 months postpartum, sustained remission was observed in 79.7%. Patients treated with lithium had a significantly lower rate of relapse compared with those treated with antipsychotic monotherapy. Multiparity and nonaffective psychosis were identified as risk factors for relapse. The authors conclude that a structured treatment algorithm with the sequential addition of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and lithium may result in high rates of remission in patients with first-onset postpartum psychosis and that lithium maintenance may be most beneficial for relapse prevention.",

Clinically relevant decrease was present in 34% BZD/Z users and 27% nonusers (NS). Controlled for age, gender, education and BZD/Z use, the significant risk factors for clinically relevant cognitive decline were depression, hearing and functional impairment. Frequent reading was associated with less MMSE decrease. Our findings could not demonstrate with statistical significance that BZD/Z use was associated with fast cognitive decline. The risk factors for fast decline were depression, hearing and functional impairment, and the absence of a reading attitude. In addition, BZD/Z use and depression were associated, indicating a complex relationship.",

Of these, 22.0% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a019.8% to 24.2%) underwent pregnancy testing. The most frequent teratogenic medications administered without pregnancy testing were benzodiazepines (52.2%; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a031.1% to 72.7%), antibiotics (10.7%; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a05.0% to 16.3%), and antiepileptics (7.7%; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.12% to 15.5%).

    "8": "Astrocytes synthesize and release endozepines, a family of regulatory neuropeptides, including diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing fragments such as the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). At the molecular level, ODN interacts with two types of receptors, i.e. it acts as an inverse agonist of the central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR), and as an agonist of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). ODN exerts a wide range of biological effects mediated through these two receptors and, in particular, it regulates astrocyte activity through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism involving the metabotropic receptor. More recently, it has been shown that M\u00fcller glial cells secrete phosphorylated DBI and that bisphosphorylated ODN ([bisphospho-Thr(3,9)]ODN, bpODN) has a stronger affinity for CBR than ODN. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate whether bpODN is released by mouse cortical astrocytes and to compare its potency to ODN. Using a radioimmunoassay and mass spectrometry analysis we have shown that bpODN as well as ODN were released in cultured astrocyte supernatants. Both bpODN and ODN increased astrocyte calcium event frequency but in a very different range of concentration. Indeed, ODN stimulatory effect decreased at concentrations over 10(-10)M whereas bpODN increased the calcium event frequency at similar doses. In vivo effects of bpODN and ODN were analyzed in two behavioral paradigms involving either the metabotropic receptor (anorexia) or the CBR (anxiety). As previously described, ODN (100ng, icv) induced a significant reduction of food intake. Similar effect was achieved with bpODN but at a 10 times higher dose (1000 ng, icv). Similarly, and contrasting with our hypothesis, bpODN was also 10 times less potent than ODN to induce anxiety-related behavior in the elevated zero maze test. Thus, the present data do not support that phosphorylation of ODN is involved in receptor selectivity but indicate that it rather weakens ODN activity.",

In order to study the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution in rat, a specific ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed with midazolam as internal standard. The calibration curves in plasma and tissues were linear in the range of 5-5000ng/mL (r(2)>0.99). The recoveries were better than 80.4% and matrix effects ranged from 96.9% to 105.1%. Then, the developed UPLC-MS/MS method was applied to determine the concentration of XL184 in blood and tissues. The pharmacokinetics of four different dosages (iv 5, 10mg/kg and ig 15, 30mg/kg) revealed that XL184 was eliminated slowly, the t1/2 was longer than 10h and the absolute bioavailability was 25.6\u00b18.3%. The concentration distribution of XL184 in tissues was liver>lung>kidney>spleen>heart. Based on the concentration-time of XL184 in tissues, a BP-ANN distribution model was developed with good performance, and can be used to predict the concentration of XL184 in tissues.", 
    "10": "GABAA receptors (GABA(A)Rs) mediate rapid inhibitory transmission in the brain. GABA(A)Rs are ligand-gated chloride ion channel proteins and exist in about a dozen or more heteropentameric subtypes exhibiting variable age and brain regional localization and thus participation in differing brain functions and diseases. GABA(A)Rs are also subject to modulation by several chemotypes of allosteric ligands that help define structure and function, including subtype definition. The channel blocker picrotoxin identified a noncompetitive channel blocker site in GABA(A)Rs. This ligand site is located in the transmembrane channel pore, whereas the GABA agonist site is in the extracellular domain at subunit interfaces, a site useful for low energy coupled conformational changes of the functional channel domain. Two classes of pharmacologically important allosteric modulatory ligand binding sites reside in the extracellular domain at modified agonist sites at other subunit interfaces: the benzodiazepine site and the high-affinity, relevant to intoxication, ethanol site. The benzodiazepine site is specific for certain GABA(A)R subtypes, mainly synaptic, while the ethanol site is found at a modified benzodiazepine site on different, extrasynaptic, subtypes. In the transmembrane domain are allosteric modulatory ligand sites for diverse chemotypes of general anesthetics: the volatile and intravenous agents, barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, long-chain alcohols, and neurosteroids. The last are endogenous positive allosteric modulators. X-ray crystal structures of prokaryotic and invertebrate pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, and the mammalian GABA(A)R protein, allow homology modeling of GABA(A)R subtypes with the various ligand sites located to suggest the structure and function of these proteins and their pharmacological modulation.", 
    "11": "GABAA receptors (GABA(A)Rs) and glycine receptors are key elements of the spinal control of nociception and pain. Compromised functioning of these two transmitter systems contributes to chronic pain states. Restoring their proper function through positive allosteric modulators should constitute a rational approach to the treatment of chronic pain syndromes involving diminished inhibitory spinal pain control. Although classical benzodiazepines (i.e., full agonists at the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A)Rs) potentiate synaptic inhibition in spinal pain controlling circuits, they lack clinically relevant analgesic activity in humans. Recent data obtained from experiments in GABA(A)R point-mutated mice suggests dose-limiting sedative effects of classical nonspecific benzodiazepines as the underlying cause. Experiments in genetically engineered mice resistant to the sedative effects of classical benzodiazepines and studies with novel less sedating benzodiazepines have indeed shown that profound antihyperalgesia can be obtained at least in preclinical pain models. Present evidence suggests that compounds with high intrinsic activity at \u03b12-GABA(A)R and minimal agonistic activity at \u03b11-GABA(A)R should possess relevant antihyperalgesic activity without causing unwanted sedation. On-going preclinical studies in genetically engineered mice and clinical trials with more selective benzodiazepine site agonists should soon provide additional insights into this emerging topic.", 
    "12": "Briefly after the landmark discovery by Hanns M\u00f6hler that GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R) are the site of action of benzodiazepine site ligands, their distribution in the rodent CNS during development was mapped by autoradiography, demonstrating early and widespread expression of GABA(A)R in the brain and spinal cord. Ten years later, the first studies using subunit-specific antibodies revealed unsuspected heterogeneity in the subunit composition of GABA(A)R in developing brain, with striking regional specificity and rapid changes in expression and subcellular localization correlating with the maturation of neuronal circuits. These data contributed to the wealth of evidence that GABAergic neurotransmission, acting both synaptically and extrasynaptically, modulates major steps of neuronal development (proliferation, migration, differentiation, and circuit formation). In immature neurons, GABA(A)R activation leads to neuronal depolarization and activation of Ca(2+) signals, which mediate many of the developmental effects of GABA. Therefore, GABA(A)R heterogeneity might be essential to fine-tune GABA actions in the dynamics of CNS maturation. Furthermore, since a disturbance of GABAergic function during ontogeny can potentially affect many aspects of CNS maturation and contribute to the etiology of major brain disorders, GABA(A)R heterogeneity provides a substrate for the development of a tailored pharmacology targeting specific receptor subtypes. This chapter provides a brief overview of these issues with a special focus on the seminal contributions of Hanns M\u00f6hler to the emergence of these concepts of fundamental relevance in today's neuroscience research and pharmacological developments.", 
    "13": "I first met Hanns in 1977 and soon learnt of his extraordinary ability as a researcher. He became a friend as well as a mentor providing enthusiasm for my own research. I watched closely over the years how his research uncovered details of the association of the benzodiazepines and GABA and delineated the structural composition of the GABAA receptor associated with the action of individual drugs such as antianxiety and antiepileptic agents. His work produced many important contributions to medicine notable of which was the discovery of the first benzodiazepine antagonists, which are now routinely used in clinical practice. But for me his most important contribution was the discovery of the benzodiazepine receptor. During this time, my group uncovered a novel receptor for GABA and my progress in this work was encouraged and enhanced by discussions with Hanns.",

The present study reviewed routine drug screening data of forensic autopsy cases (n=2996) during an 18.5-year period (January 1996-June 2014) at our institute to examine the efficacy of the procedures and findings in autopsy diagnosis and interpretation. Drug screening was performed using on-site immunoassay screening devices and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in all cases, followed by re-examination using GC/MS and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) at a cooperating institute in specific cases in the last 4 years. GC/MS detected drugs in 486 cases (16.2%), including amphetamines (n=160), major tranquilizers (n=72), minor tranquilizers (n=294), antidepressants (n=21), cold remedies (n=77), and other drugs (n=19). Among these cases, fatal intoxication (n=123) involved amphetamines (n=73), major tranquilizers (n=37), minor tranquilizers (n=86), antidepressants (n=3), and cold remedies (n=9); most cases involved self-administration, alleged suicide and accidental overdose, while homicide was not included. These drugs were also identified in other manners of death, including homicide (n=40/372), suicide (n=34/226), accidental falls (n=27/129), and natural death (n=72/514). In these cases, on-site immunoassay screening of drugs of abuse showed negative findings in 2440 cases (81.4% in all cases), while GC/MS detected other drugs in 218 cases (7.3% in all cases), including several antipsychotic drugs, acetaminophen and salicylic acid. Further analysis using LC/MS/MS detected low concentrations of benzodiazepines in 32 cases, and also anti-diabetic and hypertensive drugs in a case of fatal abuse. These observations indicate the efficacy of systematic routine toxicological analysis to investigate not only the cause of death but also the background of fatalities in forensic autopsy. The provision of extensive drug screening is needed for forensic and social risk management, considering the marked diversity of medical and illicit drugs.",

The benchmark dose values ranged from 2\u2005mg/kg bodyweight for heroin to 531\u2005mg/kg bodyweight for alcohol (ethanol). For individual exposure the four substances alcohol, nicotine, cocaine and heroin fall into the \"high risk\" category with MOE < 10, the rest of the compounds except THC fall into the \"risk\" category with MOE < 100. On a population scale, only alcohol would fall into the \"high risk\" category, and cigarette smoking would fall into the \"risk\" category, while all other agents (opiates, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants, ecstasy, and benzodiazepines) had MOEs > 100, and cannabis had a MOE > 10,000.

    "39": "Introduction. Symptoms of both hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can be easily overlooked in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We report on a patient whose parkinsonian tremor worsened and proved refractory not only to common treatment, but also to deep brain stimulation (DBS). Case Presentation. A 61-year-old woman with advanced PD underwent bilateral subthalamic DBS, with an excellent outcome. Twenty-one months after the surgery, however, patient's resting/postural tremor markedly worsened. There was a slight improvement for 1 month after repeated adjustments of DBS parameters, but then the tremor worsened again. Since even a minimal increase of the dose of dopaminergic drugs caused extremely severe dyskinesias, an anticholinergic drug biperiden and benzodiazepine clonazepam were introduced, what helped for another month. With the onset of severe diarrhoea, a laboratory workup was performed. Thyrotoxicosis was detected. During treatment with the antithyroid agent carbimazole, the parkinsonian tremor clearly improved within two weeks. Conclusion. A hyperthyroid state can markedly exaggerate all forms of tremor, as well as other types of movement disorders. This condition can be overlooked or masked by other symptoms. Therefore, if the tremor in a patient with PD gradually worsens and proves resistant to the usual treatment, examine the thyroid gland.", 
    "40": "Multiple components of \"\u03b3-oscillations\" between 30-170 Hz in the CA1 region of the hippocampus have been described, based on their coherence with oscillations in other brain regions and on their cross-frequency coupling with local \u03b8-oscillations. However, it remains unclear whether the different sub-bands are generated by a single broadband oscillator coupled to multiple external inputs, or by separate oscillators that incorporate distinct circuit elements. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used high-density linear array recording electrodes in awake behaving mice to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of \u03b3-oscillations and their responses to midazolam and atropine. We characterized oscillations using current source density (CSD) analysis, and measured \u03b8-\u03b3 phase-amplitude coupling by cross frequency coupling (CFC) analysis. Prominent peaks were present in the CSD signal in the mid- and distal apical dendritic layers at all frequencies, and at stratum pyramidale for \u03b3(slow) (30-45 Hz) and \u03b3(mid) (50-90 Hz), but not \u03b3(fast) (90-170 Hz) oscillations. Differences in the strength and timing of \u03b8-\u03b3(slow) and \u03b8-\u03b3(mid) cross frequency coupling, and a lack of coupling at the soma and mid-apical region for \u03b3(fast) oscillations, indicated that separate circuit components generate the three sub-bands. Midazolam altered CSD amplitudes and cross-frequency coupling in a lamina- and frequency specific manner, providing further evidence for separate generator circuits. Atropine altered CSD amplitudes and \u03b8-\u03b3 CFC uniformly at all locations. Simulations using a detailed compartmental model were consistent with \u03b3(slow) and \u03b3(mid) oscillations driven primarily by inputs at the mid-apical dendrites, and \u03b3(fast) at the distal apical dendrite. Our results indicate that multiple distinct local circuits generate \u03b3-oscillations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and provide detailed information about their spatiotemporal characteristics.",

The lower limit of quantification values ranged from 0.5 to 5 pg/mg of hair. Calibration curves were linear for almost all the compounds and ranged from the limit of quantification to 620 pg/mg hair. The bias and relative standard deviation of the intraday and interday imprecision were lower than 15% in 3 fortified \"in-house\" quality control samples, 1 external quality control sample, and 1 authentic hair sample (from a diazepam user). No significant matrix effects were observed for most of the compounds, and the extraction efficiency of the sample cleanup procedure ranged from 19% to 82% with a relative standard deviation <15% [except for clobazam (16%), loprazolam (20%), brotizolam (18%), and 7-aminoclonazepam (20%)].

Implant-based reconstruction patients had significantly higher visual analogue scale scores (p < 0.0001) and total narcotic use (p < 0.0001) through postoperative day 3 compared with autologous tissue-based reconstruction patients. When controlling for reconstruction method, bilateral procedures were more painful (visual analogue scale score and patient-controlled analgesia attempts, both p < 0.001). When controlling for laterality, unilateral implant-based and autologous reconstructions had comparable visual analogue scale scores (p = 0.38) and patient-controlled analgesia attempts. However, unilateral implant-based procedures required more narcotic use than unilateral autologous tissue-based procedures (p = 0.0012).",

The established first-line treatment consists of benzodiazepines, most frequently intravenous lorazepam. Benzodiazepines that do not require intravenous administration like intranasal midazolam or intramuscular midazolam are becoming more popular because of easier administration in the field. Other benzodiazepines may also be effective. After treatment with benzodiazepines, treatment with fosphenytoin and phenobarbital is usually recommended. Other intravenously available AEDs, such as valproate and levetiracetam, may be as effective and safe as fosphenytoin and phenobarbital, have a faster infusion time and better pharmacokinetic profile. The rationale behind the need for an early treatment of SE is discussed. The real-time delays of AED administration in clinical practice are described.", 
    "61": "There is limited evidence to support what the best initial benzodiazepine or the best non-benzodiazepine AED is. Recent and developing multicenter trials are evaluating the best treatment options and will likely modify the recommended treatment choices in SE in the near future. Additionally, more research is needed to understand how different treatment options modify prognosis in SE. Timely implementation of care protocols to minimize treatment delays is crucial.",

NMS most often occurs shortly after the initiation, dose increase or withdrawal of the offending agent, but can rarely occur after long-term treatment at stable doses. Immediate discontinuation of the causative agent (or re-administration if the cause is the withdrawal of neuroleptic therapy) along with supportive therapy to maintain cardiorespiratory stability and to reduce fever are the cornerstone of the management of NMS. Additional 'specific' treatments include dantrolene, bromocriptine and amantadine, but their role in the management of NMS is controversial.",

Among the existing BDI evaluation methods, clinical studies are the most desirable, but due to their expense and protracted time-line for completion, conventional in vitro methodologies remain the most frequently used BDI assessment tools. However, many predictions generated from in vitro studies are inconsistent with clinical findings. Accordingly, the present study aimed to develop a novel ex vivo approach for BDI assessment and expand the safety evaluation methodology in applied ethnopharmacological research.", 
    "65": "This approach differs from conventional in vitro methods in that rather than botanical extracts or individual phytochemicals being prepared in artificial buffers, human plasma/serum collected from a limited number of subjects administered botanical supplements was utilized to assess BDIs. To validate the methodology, human plasma/serum samples collected from healthy subjects administered either milk thistle or goldenseal extracts were utilized in incubation studies to determine their potential inhibitory effects on CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, respectively. Silybin A and B, two principal milk thistle phytochemicals, and hydrastine and berberine, the purported active constituents in goldenseal, were evaluated in both phosphate buffer and human plasma based in vitro incubation systems.",

Compared to conventional in vitro BDI methodologies of assessment, the introduction of human plasma into the in vitro study model changed the observed inhibitory effect of silybin A, silybin B and hydrastine and berberine on CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, respectively, results which more closely mirrored those generated in clinical study.",

    "68": "Anxiety disorders predispose individuals to the development of alcohol dependence in humans. Surprisingly, whether anxiety is a trait influencing the development of alcohol-related behaviors in rodents remains controversial. Here, we addressed the hypothesis of a relationship between basal anxiety levels and the development of ethanol (EtOH)-induced behavioral sensitization (EIBS), a model of neuroadaptations occurring after repeated EtOH exposure which is proposed to play a role in early and recurring steps of addiction.", 
    "69": "EtOH-na\u00efve DBA/2J mice were submitted to the elevated plus maze and light/dark box tests to evaluate their basal anxiety levels. Then, mice received daily intraperitoneal injection of saline or 2\u00a0g/kg EtOH for 10\u00a0days and locomotor activity was immediately monitored. Mice were then split into resistant and sensitized phenotypes based on their increase in locomotion. The relationship between basal anxiety and the development of sensitization was investigated. In addition, we tested the effect of an 8-day-long treatment with 4\u00a0mg/kg diazepam, a broad-spectrum benzodiazepine anxiolytic, on the expression of sensitization in both resistant and sensitized mice.", 
    "70": "For the first time, we showed that vulnerability to EIBS is negatively correlated with basal anxiety. Moreover, a diazepam treatment during EIBS procedure increased EtOH-induced hyperlocomotion of resistant mice after 1\u00a0week of withdrawal (but not immediately after) without any effect in the group of sensitized mice.", 
    "71": "This study shows that, in mice, basal anxiety predicts the vulnerability to EIBS. Mice exhibiting low basal anxiety will develop higher EIBS than mice with elevated anxiety levels. Modulation of anxiety by a diazepam treatment during the development of EIBS enhances its expression after 1\u00a0week postinduction. Altogether, we demonstrated an inverse relationship between basal anxiety-like behaviors and EIBS vulnerability and that resistance to EIBS vanishes after anxiolytic treatment.", 
    "72": "Patients with schizophrenia display metacognitive impairments, such as hasty decision-making during probabilistic reasoning - the \"jumping to conclusion\" bias (JTC). Our recent fMRI study revealed reduced activations in the right ventral striatum (VS) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to be associated with decision-making in patients with schizophrenia. It is unclear whether these functional alterations occur in the at-risk mental state (ARMS).",

None of the ARMS patients was treated with antipsychotics. Both tasks request probabilistic decisions after a variable amount of stimuli. We evaluated activation during decision-making under certainty versus uncertainty and the process of final decision-making.", 
    "74": "We included 24 AMRS patients and 24 controls in our study. Compared with controls, ARMS patients tended to draw fewer beads and showed significantly more JTC bias in the classical beads task, mirroring findings in patients with schizophrenia. During fMRI, ARMS patients did not demonstrate JTC bias on the behavioural level, but showed a significant hypoactivation in the right VS during the decision stage.", 
    "75": "Owing to the cross-sectional design of the study, results are constrained to a better insight into the neurobiology of risk constellations, but not prepsychotic stages. Nine of the ARMS patients were treated with antidepressants and/or lorazepam.", 
    "76": "As in patients with schizophrenia, a striatal hypoactivation was found in ARMS patients. Confounding effects of antipsychotic medication can be excluded. Our findings indicate that error prediction signalling and reward anticipation may be linked to striatal dysfunction during prodromal stages and should be examined for their utility in predicting transition risk.", 
    "77": "In Denmark, fatal poisoning among drug addicts is often related to methadone. The primary mechanism contributing to fatal methadone overdose is respiratory depression. Concurrent use of other central nervous system (CNS) depressants is suggested to heighten the potential for fatal methadone toxicity. Reduced tolerance due to a short-time abstinence period is also proposed to determine a risk for fatal overdose. The primary aims of this study were to investigate if concurrent use of CNS depressants or reduced tolerance were significant risk factors in methadone-related fatalities using segmental hair analysis. The study included 99 methadone-related fatalities collected in Denmark from 2008 to 2011, where both blood and hair were available. The cases were divided into three subgroups based on the cause of death; methadone poisoning (N=64), poly-drug poisoning (N=28) or methadone poisoning combined with fatal diseases (N=7). No significant differences between methadone concentrations in the subgroups were obtained in both blood and hair. The methadone blood concentrations were highly variable (0.015-5.3, median: 0.52mg/kg) and mainly within the concentration range detected in living methadone users. In hair, methadone was detected in 97 fatalities with concentrations ranging from 0.061 to 211ng/mg (median: 11ng/mg). In the remaining two cases, methadone was detected in blood but absent in hair specimens, suggesting that these two subjects were methadone-naive users. Extensive poly-drug use was observed in all three subgroups, both recently and within the last months prior to death. Especially, concurrent use of multiple benzodiazepines was prevalent among the deceased followed by the abuse of morphine, codeine, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and ethanol. By including quantitative segmental hair analysis, additional information on poly-drug use was obtained. Especially, 6-acetylmorphine was detected more frequently in hair specimens, indicating that regular abuse of heroin was common among the deceased. In conclusion, continuous exposure of methadone provide by segmental hair analysis suggested that reduced tolerance of methadone was not a critical factor among methadone-related fatalities. In contrast, a high abundance of co-ingested CNS depressants suggested that adverse effects from drug-drug interactions were more important risk factors for fatal outcome in these deaths.",

A Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised scale score \u226515 at presentation was significantly associated with increased odds of complications (p = 0.005). There was a trend toward significance of association of complications with tachycardia, history of delirium tremens, and benzodiazepines being administered before psychiatric consultation. The groups did not significantly differ with respect to age, admission blood alcohol level, Charlson Comorbidity Index, comorbid recent substance abuse, or length of stay.",

There are relatively few systematic treatment trials in the area of ADWA, and there are few data on predictors of treatment response. Etifoxine is a promising agent insofar as it is not associated with dependence, but in primary care settings benzodiazepines continue to be frequently prescribed for psychiatric symptoms. A randomized controlled trial of etifoxine versus alprazolam for ADWA was undertaken, focusing on efficacy and safety measures, and including an investigation of predictors of clinical response.", 
    "84": "This was a comparative, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial in two parallel groups of outpatients with ADWA. One group was treated with 150 mg/day for etifoxine, and the other with 1.5 mg/day for alprazolam for 28 days. Patients were followed for 4 weeks of treatment, and for an additional week after treatment discontinuation. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), while secondary outcome measures included the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), the Clinical Global Impressions-Change Scale (CGI-C), and the Self-Report for the Assessment of Adjustment Disorders. Non-inferiority analysis was used to assess the primary outcome measure, and a multivariate logistic regression was employed to investigate predictors of response.", 
    "85": "Two hundred and two adult outpatients with ADWA were enrolled at 17 primary care sites. One hundred and seventy seven patients completed the study (n = 87 in the etifoxine group; n = 90 in the alprazolam group). Etifoxine and alprazolam were accompanied by decreases in the HAM-A at day 28, with a difference between treatment groups in HAM-A score of 1.78 [90% CI; 0.23, 3.33] in favor of alprazolam. However, after medication discontinuation, HAM-A scores continued to improve in the etifoxine group, but increased in the alprazolam group; the difference between groups in mean change between day 28 and day 35 was significant (p = 0.019). Secondary outcome measures showed similar results for etifoxine and alprazolam at day 35. More treatment-related adverse events were reported in patients treated with alprazolam, particularly central nervous system-related AEs, and especially after medication discontinuation. No significant predictors of treatment response were found.", 
    "86": "This randomized controlled trial provides support for the efficacy and safety of etifoxine in the management of adjustment disorder with anxiety, particularly when treatment discontinuation data are also assessed. Etifoxine has the important clinical advantage of having anxiolytic effects, which are not being associated with dependence. Pharmacotherapy was equally efficacious in patients with more severe anxiety symptoms at baseline. Additional work using longer-term follow-up and collecting data on cost-efficiency of management options would further advance the field of ADWA.",

Eighteen days after initiation of rufinamide, agranulocytosis developed associated with high fever and skin rash, all of which resolved after withdrawal of rufinamide. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated normocellular marrow with selective decrease of mature myeloid series, and suggested that agranulocytosis was not related to malignancy or serious infection.",

    "91": "The International Conference on Harmonization considers older people a 'special population', as they differ from younger adults in terms of comorbidity, polypharmacy, pharmacokinetics and greater vulnerability to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Medical practice is often based on single disease guidelines derived from clinical trials that have not included frail older people or those with multiple morbidities. This presents a challenge caring for older people, as drug doses in trials may not be achievable in real world patients and risks of ADRs are underestimated in clinical trial populations. The majority of ADRs in older people are Type A, potentially avoidable and associated with commonly prescribed medications. Several ADRs are particularly associated with major adverse consequences in the elderly and their reduction is therefore a clinical priority. Falls are strongly associated with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants and antihypertensives. There is good evidence for medication review as part of a multifactorial intervention to reduce falls risk in community dwelling elderly. Multiple medications also contribute to delirium, another multifactorial syndrome resulting in excess mortality particularly in frail older people. Clostridium difficile associated with use of broad spectrum antibiotics mainly affects frail older people and results in prolonged hospital stay with substantial morbidity and mortality. Antipsychotics increase the risk of stroke by more than three-fold in patients with dementia. Inappropriate prescribing can be reduced by adherence to prescribing guidelines, suitable monitoring and regular medication review. Given the heterogeneity within the older population, providing individualized care is pivotal to preventing ADRs.",

The parameter studied was the increase of GABA-activated chloride currents caused by these substances. The contributions of \u03b16 \u03b22/3 \u03b32 and \u03b11 \u03b16 \u03b22/3 \u03b32 receptor subtypes to the increase of GABA-activated chloride current were investigated by comparing the effects of such substances in the presence vs. the absence of furosemide. Furosemide is in fact able to block such receptors. It was found that the percent enhancement of peak GABA-activated current doubled for diazepam, clobazam, and RL 214. However, it did not change for N-desmethyl-diazepam. These results indicate that diazepam, clobazam, and RL 214 interact exclusively with \u03b11 \u03b22/3 \u03b32 receptors, while N-desmethyl-diazepam seems to interact with not only \u03b11- but also \u03b16-containing receptors.",

However, the effect of JM-20 on the functionality of the glutamatergic system has not been investigated. In this study, by using different in vitro preparations, we investigated the effects of JM-20 on (i) rat brain synaptic vesicles (L-[(3)H]-glutamate uptake, proton gradient built-up and bafilomycin-sensitive H(+)-ATPase activity), (ii) rat brain synaptosomes (glutamate release) and (iii) primary cultures of rat cortical neurons, astrocytes and astrocyte-neuron co-cultures (L-[(3)H]-glutamate uptake and glutamate release). We observed here that JM-20 impairs H(+)-ATPase activity and consequently reduces vesicular glutamate uptake. This molecule also inhibits glutamate release from brain synaptosomes and markedly increases glutamate uptake in astrocytes alone, and co-cultured neurons and astrocytes. The impairment of vesicular glutamate uptake by inhibition of the H(+)-ATPase caused by JM-20 could decrease the amount of the transmitter stored in synaptic vesicles, increase the cytosolic levels of glutamate, and will thus down-regulate neurotransmitter release. Together, these results contribute to explain the anti-excitotoxic effect of JM-20 and its strong neuroprotective effect observed in different in vitro and in vivo models of brain ischemia.",

They are capable to inhibit or stimulate the binding of GABAA receptor-specific ligands, like t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate, flunitrazepam and muscimol. We have previously characterized a set of oxygen-bridged synthetic steroids (SS) analogs to A or P using synaptosomes. Considering that the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor throughout the central nervous system affects the magnitude of the modulation of the GABAA receptor by NAS, we evaluated the action of two selected SS, in brain sections containing the cerebral cortex (CC) and hippocampus (HC) using quantitative receptor autoradiography. Both SS affected the binding of the three ligands in a similar way to A and P, with some differences on certain CC layers according to the ligand used. One of the SS, the 3\u03b1-hydroxy-6,19-epoxypregn-4-ene-20-one (compound 5), behaved similarly to the natural neuroactive steroids. However, significant differences with compound 5 were observed on the HC CA2 region, making it steroid suitable for a specific action. Those differences may be related to structural conformation of the SS and the subunits' composition present on the receptor complex.",

Next, we examined whether the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors induced by d-cycloserine (DCS, 5 mg/kg i.p., a NMDA partial agonist) before memory reactivation can facilitate the disruptive effect of PROP and MDZ on fear memory in ETOH rats.",

The resistance to MDZ's disruptive effect on fear memory reconsolidation may be, at least in part, associated with changes in the GABAA-R composition induced by chronic ethanol administration/withdrawal.", 
    "108": "The co-occurrence of substance use disorders (SUDs) and anxiety disorders has been now well established. This association is frequent and can be explained by three models: the shared vulnerability factors model, the self-medication model, and the substance-induced model. General population epidemiological studies provide strong evidence of the frequency of the association for the most used substances: tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and to a lesser extent sedatives, opiates, and cocaine. For substances that are less commonly used in the general population, the frequency of the co-occurrence can more precisely be studied in clinical samples. We provide the most recent literature results on the association of SUDs and anxiety, and evidence for one explicative model or the other when available. For substances with sedative properties (alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, opioids), both evidence for a self-medication and for a toxic effect exist. For substances with psychostimulant properties (tobacco, cocaine, and amphetamines), the literature favors the toxic hypothesis to explain the association with anxiety disorders. We give practical steps for the recognition of these dual diagnoses and present therapeutic issues, although the strategies are rarely evidence based.",

Currently, Diazepam rectal gel is the only approved therapy for the outpatient management of seizures, but there is a growing need for alternative medications for terminating seizures that may be not only safe and effective but also socially acceptable. According to this, the autoinjector device appears to be a promising tool for the treatment of acute repetitive seizures. Recent studies comparing diazepam autoinjector (AI) with placebo suggest that diazepam AI could be a safe and effective option to treat acute repetitive seizures when administered by trained caregivers in outpatient settings. However, additional studies comparing diazepam AI with a standard treatment are necessary to define possible added benefits of this technique.",

For the outpatient treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal, it is recommended that the drug should first be switched to an equivalent dose of another benzodiazepine with an intermediate or long-acting effect; the dose should then, in general, be reduced weekly. In case of consumption of a high dose (\u2265 20 mg diazepam equivalent), hospitalization and the additional administration of carbamazepine or valproic acid are recommended.

The combination of ketamine and benzodiazepines are commonly used to induce anesthesia before intubation in hemodynamic instable patients. The choice of a muscle relaxant for anesthesia induction is either a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent or succinylcholine. Administration of mannitol or hypertonic saline is effective to rapidly decrease intracranial pressure.

Rats were pretreated with saline solution or amphetamine (1\u00a0mg/kg) from day 1 to day 3 and then exposed, immediately after injection of amphetamine, to medicinal air or argon at 75\u00a0vol% (with the remainder being oxygen).

In contrast, argon had effect on locomotor and mu receptor activity neither in rats pretreated with saline and challenged with amphetamine (acute amphetamine) nor in rats pretreated and challenged with saline solution (controls).

Data on demographic and addiction history, ADHD (Wender Utah Rating Scale), cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Exam), and lifetime DSM-IV-TR psychiatric diagnosis from admission were retrieved, and retention following 6 months. None of the 190 patients in Las Vegas tested positive for methylphenidate, while 14.7% (45/306) did in Tel Aviv. Abusers were less educated (p = 0.01), had higher ADHD scores (p = 0.02), lower cognitive scores (p = 0.05), and a higher benzodiazepine (BDZ) abuse rate (p < 0.0005), with no difference in age, gender, duration in MMT, cannabis, opiates, and cocaine abuse and infectious disease. Of the methylphenidate abuse 42.2% have take-home methadone dose privileges. Not like opiate use, being methylphenidate positive did not relate to 6-months retention. Compared to Tel Aviv, Las Vegas patients were more educated, with lower BDZ, and cocaine abuse. The greater abuse of methylphenidate among ADHD subjects might indicate their using it as self-medication, raising a possible indication for its prescription for that subgroup of MMT patients.

    "130": "Recent studies in animal models have suggested that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is involved in several features of mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), and that its inhibition could have therapeutic interests. However, it remains controversial whether mTOR activation is the cause or the consequence of MTLE. We previously showed in a mouse model of MTLE associated with hippocampal sclerosis that increased neuronal excitability and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) overexpression contribute to the development of morphological features of this form of epilepsy. Here, we addressed whether mTOR activation promotes MTLE epileptogenesis via increasing neuronal excitability and/or BDNF expression or rather mediates neuroplasticity associated with hippocampal sclerosis. In mice injected intrahippocampally with kainate (1 nmol), we showed a biphasic increase of phospho-S6 (p-S6) ribosomal protein expression, the downstream product of the mTOR signaling pathway, in the dispersed granule cell layer (GCL) of the dentate gyrus with a second phase lasting up to 6 months. Chronic treatment with rapamycin suppressed p-S6 expression, granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting, but did not reduce cell loss, BDNF overexpression, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)67 expression or the development of hippocampal paroxysmal discharges. Neuronal inhibition by midazolam (2 \u00d7 10 mg/kg, i.p.) abolished the increased expression of p-S6 in the dispersed GCL. Our data suggest that activation of the mTOR signaling pathway results from the increased neuronal excitation that develops in the GCL and may contribute to MTLE morphological changes. However, these data do not support the role of this pathway in the development of MTLE or its inhibition as a therapy for this form of epilepsy.",

Temporal neocortex contributes to either seizure propagation or generation in TLE, a situation that has been associated with alterations of the \u03b3-amino-butyric acid (GABA) system. On the other hand, an impaired neurotransmission mediated by GABA in temporal neocortex has also been involved with the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. In spite of these situations, the role of the necortical GABA system in the comorbidity of TLE and mood disorders has not been investigated. The present study was designed to identify alterations in the GABA system such as binding to GABAA and GABAB receptors and benzodiazepine site, the tissue content of GABA and the expression of the mRNA encoding the \u03b11-6, \u03b21-3, and \u03b3 GABAA subunits, in the temporal neocortex of surgically treated patients with TLE with and without anxiety, and/or depression. Neocortex of patients with TLE and comorbid anxiety and/or depression showed increased expression of the mRNA encoding the \u03b32-subunit, reduced GABAB-induced G-protein activation in spite of elevated GABAB binding, and lower tissue content of GABA when compared to autopsy controls. Some of these changes significantly correlated with seizure frequency and duration of epilepsy. The results obtained suggest a dysfunction of the GABAergic neurotransmission in temporal neocortex of patients with TLE and comorbid anxiety and/or depression that could be also influenced by clinical factors such as seizure frequency and duration of illness.",

It has been reported that amyloid \u03b2-protein (\u0391\u03b2) fibrillogenesis, which is closely related to AD, is accelerated by exposure to anesthetics. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain uncertain. This study was designed to investigate whether the anesthetic midazolam affects \u0391\u03b2 fibrillogenesis, and if so, whether it acts through GM1 ganglioside (GM1) on the neuronal surface. Midazolam treatment decreased GM1 expression in the detergent-resistant membrane microdomains of neurons, and these effects were regulated by the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor. Midazolam inhibited \u0391\u03b2 fibril formation from soluble \u0391\u03b2 on the neuronal surface. In addition, midazolam suppressed GM1-induced fibril formation in a cell-free system. Moreover, midazolam inhibited the formation of \u0391\u03b2 assemblies in synaptosomes isolated from aged mouse brains.

    "149": "GABAergic signaling in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) plays a crucial role on the modulation of the stress influence on fear memory. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that the dorsal hippocampus (DH) is a downstream target of BLA neurons in contextual fear. Given that hippocampal structural plasticity is proposed to provide a substrate for the storage of long-term memories, the main aim of this study is to evaluate the modulation of GABA neurotransmission in the BLA on spine density in the DH following stress on contextual fear learning. The present findings show that prior stressful experience promoted contextual fear memory and enhanced spine density in the DH. Intra-BLA infusion of midazolam, a positive modulator of GABAa sites, prevented the facilitating influence of stress on both fear retention and hippocampal dendritic spine remodeling. Similarly to the stress-induced effects, the blockade of GABAa sites within the BLA ameliorated fear memory emergence and induced structural remodeling in the DH. These findings suggest that GABAergic transmission in BLA modulates the structural changes in DH associated to the influence of stress on fear memory.", 
    "150": "The effect of concomitant drugs having a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitory potency on tacrolimus exposure was predicted from in vitro metabolism results. In this study, the IC\u2085\u2080 values of concomitant drugs on the formation of M-I, the major metabolite of tacrolimus, were determined, and the effect on oral exposure (AUCp.o.) of tacrolimus was assessed from static models. When an absorbed fraction (Fa ) of 0.97, intestinal wall availability (Fg) of 0.27 and fraction metabolized by CYP3A (fm(CYP3A)) of 0.8 were used, the least bias was observed for the prediction of the AUCp.o. of tacrolimus. The relationship of the IC\u2085\u2080 values of 11 inhibitors between tacrolimus and typical CYP3A substrates (midazolam and testosterone) was also analysed. A strong correlation was found between the IC\u2085\u2080 values of tacrolimus and typical CYP3A substrates (r(2) \u2009\u2265\u20090.85). The predictability of the effect of inhibitors on tacrolimus AUCp.o. was investigated based on the same static models with the use of published IC\u2085\u2080 values for midazolam and testosterone. The bias for the prediction of tacrolimus AUCp.o. was minimal with the use of IC\u2085\u2080 values determined using tacrolimus itself as a substrate. These results suggest that tacrolimus itself is still the best choice for predicting the AUCp.o. of tacrolimus, although our findings suggest that midazolam or testosterone may be used instead of tacrolimus to estimate roughly (predicted AUCp.o. within an approximately 2-fold range of observed values) the effect of CYP3A inhibitors on the tacrolimus AUCp.o.", 
    "151": "Genetic approaches have been successfully used to relate the diverse molecular actions of anesthetic agents to their amnestic, sedative, hypnotic, and immobilizing properties. The hypnotic effect of etomidate, quantified as the duration of the loss of righting reflex in mice, is equally mediated by GABAA receptors containing \u03b22- and \u03b23-protein subunits. However, only \u03b23-containing receptors are involved in producing electroencephalogram (EEG)-patterns typical of general anesthesia. The sedative action of diazepam is produced by \u03b11-subunit-containing receptors, but these receptors do not contribute to the drug's characteristic EEG-\"fingerprint.\" Thus, GABAA receptors with \u03b11- and \u03b22-subunits take a central role in causing benzodiazepine-induced sedation and etomidate-induced hypnosis, but the corresponding EEG-signature is difficult to resolve. Contrastingly, actions of etomidate and benzodiazepines mediated via \u03b12- and \u03b23-subunits modify rhythmic brain activity in vitro and in vivo at least in part by enhancing neuronal synchrony. The immobilizing action of GABAergic anesthetics predominantly involves \u03b23-subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the spinal cord. Interestingly, this action is self-limiting as GABA-release is attenuated via the same receptors. Anesthetic-induced amnesia is in part mediated by GABAA receptors harboring \u03b15-subunits that are highly enriched in the hippocampus and, in addition, by \u03b11-containing receptors in the forebrain. Because there is accumulating evidence that in patients the expression pattern of GABAA receptor subtypes varies with age, is altered by the long-term use of drugs, and is affected by pathological conditions like inflammation and sepsis, further research is recommended to adapt the use of anesthetic agents to the specific requirements of individual patients.", 
    "152": "Since their introduction in the 1960s, benzodiazepines (BZs) remain one of the most commonly prescribed medications, acting as potent sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants. The primary neural action of BZs and related compounds is augmentation of inhibitory transmission, which occurs through allosteric modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced current at the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR). The discovery of the BZ-binding site on GABAARs encouraged many to speculate that the brain produces its own endogenous ligands to this site (Costa & Guidotti, 1985). The romanticized quest for endozepines, endogenous ligands to the BZ-binding site, has uncovered a variety of ligands that might fulfill this role, including oleamides (Cravatt et al., 1995), nonpeptidic endozepines (Rothstein et al., 1992), and the protein diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) (Costa & Guidotti, 1985). Of these ligands, DBI, and affiliated peptide fragments, is the most extensively studied endozepine. The quest for the \"brain's Valium\" over the decades has been elusive as mainly negative allosteric modulatory effects have been observed (Alfonso, Le Magueresse, Zuccotti, Khodosevich, & Monyer, 2012; Costa & Guidotti, 1985), but recent evidence is accumulating that DBI displays regionally discrete endogenous positive modulation of GABA transmission through activation of the BZ receptor (Christian et al., 2013). Herein, we review the literature on this topic, focusing on identification of the endogenous molecule and its region-specific expression and function.", 
    "153": "GABAA receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. They are heteropentamers that are typically classified according to their \u03b1 subunits. By rendering each of the benzodiazepine-sensitive \u03b1 subunits (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, and \u03b15) insensitive to modulation by classical benzodiazepines by His to Arg point mutations in knock-in mice, we were able to identify behavioral functions mediated by different GABAA receptor subtypes, which led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In this chapter, we provide a largely chronological overview on behavioral studies on GABAA receptor mutant mice at the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Zurich.", 
    "154": "The study of the psychopharmacology of benzodiazepines continues to provide new insights into diverse brain functions related to vigilance, anxiety, mood, epileptiform activity, schizophrenia, cognitive performance, and autism-related social behavior. In this endeavor, the discovery of the benzodiazepine receptor was a key event, as it supplied the primary benzodiazepine drug-target site, provided the molecular link to the allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors and, following the recognition of GABAA receptor subtypes, furnished the platform for future, more selective drug actions. This review has two parts. In a retrospective first part, it acknowledges the contributions to the field made by my collaborators over the years, initially at Hoffmann-La Roche in Basle and later, in academia, at the University and the ETH of Zurich. In the second part, the new frontier of GABA pharmacology, targeting GABAA receptor subtypes, is reviewed with special focus on nonsedative anxiolytics, antidepressants, analgesics, as well as enhancers of cognition in Down syndrome and attenuators of symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. It is encouraging that a clinical trial has been initiated with a partial inverse agonist acting on \u03b15 GABAA receptors in an attempt to alleviate the cognitive deficits in Down syndrome.",

Included in this secondary analysis were only patients younger than 18 years of age. Evaluated were the associations of the treatment group (IM vs. IV) with the primary outcome, defined as seizure cessation prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, and with patient characteristics, time to important events, and adverse events. Descriptive statistics and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for the analysis.",

Similar results were noted for those younger than 11 years (RD -1.3%, 99% CI -25.7% to 23.1%). Time from initiating the treatment protocol was shorter for children who received IM midazolam, mainly due to the shorter time to administer the active treatment. Safety profiles were similar.",

    "159": "Serotonin syndrome is a drug-related toxicity caused by excess serotonin within the central nervous system. We recently encountered a case of serotonin syndrome that developed in the early postoperative period that was successfully treated with intravenous dexmedetomidine. Although the prescriptive literature has commonly recommended sedation with benzodiazepines for controlling agitation in serotonin syndrome, the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine has also been reported in several clinical conditions. In the present study, we conducted a reverse translational experiment to compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and midazolam, at equi-sedative doses, on serotonergic toxicity-like responses in rats. Animals were subcutaneously injected with 0.75\u00a0mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT, a full 5-HT1A agonist. 8-OH-DPAT-treated rats showed serotonin syndrome-like behaviors (low body posture, forepaw treading), hyperlocomotion, and decreased body temperature, which were completely inhibited by pretreatment with WAY 100635, a selective 5-HT1A antagonist (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Intramuscular injection of midazolam (1.0\u00a0mg/kg) or dexmedetomidine (0.01\u00a0mg/kg), which comparably induced observable signs of sedation, was tested in the present study. Concomitant treatment with midazolam significantly attenuated the hyperlocomotion, but failed to affect traditional serotonin syndrome behaviors and body temperature in 8-OH-DPAT-treated rats (n\u00a0=\u00a08). On the other hand, concomitant treatment with dexmedetomidine significantly attenuated all of these parameters (n\u00a0=\u00a08). The present case and related reverse translational experiment demonstrate that dexmedetomidine may be more beneficial for the treatment of serotonin syndrome compared to the current recommended treatment with benzodiazepines.",

    "168": "In this work we used Langmuir-Blodgett films (LB) as model membranes to study the effect of molecular packing on the flunitrazepam (FNZ) accessibility to the binding sites at the GABAA receptor (GABAA-R). Ligand binding data were correlated with film topography analysis by atomic force microscopy images (AFM) and SDS-PAGE. Langmuir films (LF) were prepared by the spreading of synaptosomal membranes (SM) from bovine brain cortex at the air-water interface. LBs were obtained by the transference, at 15 or 35 mN/m constant surface pressure (\u03c0), of one (LB15/1c and LB35/1c) or two (LB35/2c) LFs to a film-free hydrophobic alkylated substrate (CONglass). Transference was performed in a serial manner, which allowed the accumulation of a great number of samples. SDS-PAGE clearly showed a 55 kDa band characteristic of GABAA-R subunits. Detrended fluctuation analysis of topographic data from AFM images exhibited a single slope value (self-similarity parameter \u03b1) in CONglass and a discontinuous slope change in the \u03b1 value at an autocorrelation length of \u223c100 nm in all LB samples, supporting the LF transference to the substrate. AFM images of CONglass and LB15/1c exhibited roughness and average heights that were similar between measurements and significantly lower than those of LB35/1c and LB35/2c, suggesting that the substrate coverage in the latter was more stable than in LB15/1c. While [(3)H]FNZ binding in LB15/1c did not reach saturation, in LB35/1c the binding kinetics became sigmoid with a binding affinity lower than in the SM suspension. Our results highlight the \u03c0 dependence of both binding and topological data and call to mind the receptor mechanosensitivity. Thus, LB films provide a tool for bionanosensing GABAA-R ligand binding as well as GABAA-R activity modulation induced by the environmental supramolecular organization.",

    "171": "Sixty-three carers participated. Thirty-three children were female, median age at training was 4 years and seizure onset 2.75 years. Seizures were generalised in 26 children and focal in 37. Common reasons for prescription included history of prolonged seizures (38%), recent diagnosis of epilepsy (33%) and overseas travel (11%). Ninety-eight per cent of carers reported that training instructions were clear, and 94% reported the risks of using benzodiazepines were satisfactorily explained. Ninety per cent felt confident to administer the drug following training and 62% completed first aid training as recommended. Suggestions for improvement included follow-up/review and additional demonstration/practice. Twenty-one carers (33%) reported giving buccal midazolam a median five times, 67% reported it was effective in terminating the seizure and 71% called an ambulance as instructed. Problems reported in administration included excessive secretions and difficulties drawing up the solution. One child experienced breathing difficulties requiring oxygen by the paramedics. Four children were admitted to children's intensive care unit with status epilepticus requiring intubation.",

    "180": "Sedation of ICU patients is often essential for ICU patients to maximize survival, reduce ICU and hospital stay, and facilitate mechanical ventilation. The standard of care for sedation includes benzodiazepine sedatives and propofol. These sedatives (notably benzodiazepines) are associated with an increased risk of agitation and delirium. It has been hypothesized that dexmedetomidine would be an appropriate alternative to traditional sedatives for maintaining light to moderate sedation. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist, and it is approved in Canada for intensive care unit sedation and conscious sedation. In January 2014, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) reviewed the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of using dexmedetomidine for sedation in intensive-care unit. Based on the CADTH review, dexmedetomidine was found to be associated with decreased ICU stay and decreased time on mechanical ventilation. However, it was associated with higher rates of bradycardia than comparators. Dexmedetomidine is available in 100 mcg/mL in a 2 mL glass vials at $45.21 per vial. At the maximum allowed daily dose, dexmedetomidine is more expensive than midazolam, lorazepam, and propofol (Appendix 1). However, it is not clear if the higher cost of dexmedetomidine is offset by its suggested benefits. The objective of this report is to review the cost-effectiveness and the available evidence-based guidelines for using dexmedetomidine for sedation the intensive care unit.", 
    "181": "Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [HIE] represents the most common acquired pathology associated with neonatal seizures. HIE-associated neonatal seizures are often difficult to control, due to their refractoriness to traditional anti-seizure agents. Developmentally regulated chloride gradients during early development make the neonatal brain more seizure-susceptible by depolarizing GABAAR-mediated currents, and therefore hindering inhibition by conventional anti-seizure drugs such as phenobarbital [PB] and benzodiazepines. Pharmaco-modulation of chloride co-transporters has become a current field of research in treating refractory neonatal seizures, and the basis of two clinical trials [NCT01434225; NCT00380531]. However, the recent termination of NEMO study [NCT01434225] on bumetanide, an NKCC1 antagonist, suggests that clinical utilization of bumetanide as an adjunct to treat neonatal seizures with PB may not be a viable option. Hence, re-evaluation of bumetanide as an adjunct through pre-clinical studies is warranted. Additionally, the model-specific variability in the efficacy of bumetanide in the pre-clinical models of neonatal seizures highlights the differential consequences of insults used to induce seizures in each pre-clinical model as worth exploration. Injury itself can significantly alter the function of chloride co-transporters, and therefore the efficacy of anti-seizure agents that follow.",

    "183": "Etifoxine (etafenoxine, Stresam\u00ae) is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic with an anticonvulsant effect. It was developed in the 1960s for anxiety disorders and is currently being studied for its ability to promote peripheral nerve healing and to treat chemotherapy-induced pain. In addition to being mediated by GABAA\u03b12 receptors like benzodiazepines, etifoxine appears to produce anxiolytic effects directly by binding to \u03b22 or \u03b23 subunits of the GABAA receptor complex. It also modulates GABAA receptors indirectly via stimulation of neurosteroid production after etifoxine binds to the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) of the outer mitochondrial membrane in the central and peripheral nervous systems, previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Therefore, the effects of etifoxine are not completely reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Etifoxine is used for various emotional and bodily reactions followed by anxiety. It is contraindicated in situations such as shock, severely impaired liver or kidney function, and severe respiratory failure. The average dosage is 150 mg per day for no more than 12 weeks. The most common adverse effect is drowsiness at the initial stage. It does not usually cause any withdrawal syndromes. In conclusion, etifoxine shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and withdrawal syndromes than those of benzodiazepines. It potentiates GABAA receptor-function by a direct allosteric effect and by an indirect mechanism involving the activation of TSPO. It seems promising that non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics including etifoxine will replenish shortcomings of benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors according to animated studies related to TSPO.",

    "188": "The mitochondrial 18kDa Translocation Protein (TSPO) was first identified in 1977 by its capability to bind benzodiazepines in peripheral tissues. It is more commonly known after its previous name - peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) as opposed to the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR), from which it differs by location, structure and function. It is ubiquitous with highest expression in steroid-producing tissues, like adrenal cortex, ovaries, testicles, and placenta. The role of TSPO is crucial for living; its inactivation results in early embryonic-lethal phenotype in mice. TSPO has been implicated in various functions of cell, including steroidogenesis, cellular respiration, reactive oxygen species production, heme biosynthesis, immunomodulation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. TSPO has been shown to interact with other cellular proteins: 32 kDa voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), 30 kDa adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), cyclophilin D, hexokinase, creatinine kinase, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), phosphate carrier and Bcl-2 family. They are - involved in the formation and regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) at the junction of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. While the function and characteristics of the mPTP are known, its well defined, but its structure remains speculative. Changes in TSPO expression are associated with multiple disorders, including cancer, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders, atheromatosis, and others. - TSPO is able to bind cholesterol, porphyrins and other ligands with different affinity. The current knowledge of TSPO implicates its potential use as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in different diseases and their therapies.",

The membrane extraction with 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide coated titanium dioxide ([PMIM]Br@TiO2) sorbent used in this research is a two-phase supported membrane extraction consisting of an aqueous (donor phase), and n-octanol/nano [PMIM]Br@TiO2 (acceptor phase) system operated in direct immersion sampling mode. The 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (ionic liquid) coated nano TiO2 dispersed in the organic solvent (n-octanol) is held into a porous membrane supported by capillary forces and sonification. It is in contact with the feed phase, which is the aqueous sample. The experimental setup is very simple and highly affordable. The hollow fiber is disposable, so single use of the fiber reduces the risk of cross-contamination and carry-over problems. The proposed method allows the very effective and enriched recuperation of BZPs into one single extract. In order to obtain high extraction efficiency of the analytes using this novel sorbent, the main parameters were optimized.

The surge of luteinizing hormone levels was diminished while that of follicle-stimulating hormone did not change in animals treated with PZP in the left ovary. Interestingly, treatment with either synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone or human chorionic gonadotropin 1 h after PZP administration in the left ovary restored ovulation in both ovaries. The presence of M1R protein in the theca cells of the ovarian follicles as well as in cells of the corpus luteum was detected on proestrus day. These results suggest that M1R activation in the left ovary is required for pre-ovulatory gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion and ovulation. Furthermore, these results also suggest that M1R in the left ovary might be regulating ovulation asymmetrically through a stimulatory neural signal relayed to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve to induce the GnRH secretion which then triggers ovulation.",

Since most conditions underlying chronic refractory breathlessness in COPD are not modifiable, the use of opioids and benzodiazepines has been proposed to relieve it. However, respiratory depression is a known adverse event of these drugs, and concerns have been raised on their use in patients with chronic respiratory failure. Despite safety-related concerns, benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for a variety of reasons, including treatment of insomnia, depression and anxiety, as well as to relieve refractory dyspnea in patients with COPD. The key role of opioids in the end-of-life and in the management of dyspnea that is unresponsive to best-possible disease management is recognized. Moreover, the use of low dose opioids to treat dyspnea, discomfort or refusal for patient undergoing non-invasive ventilation is still debated. In the current review, we aim at discussing and analyzing recently published findings on the use of benzodiazepines and opioids in patients with COPD and at reviewing the literature on this topic. Recent observations favor the use of lower doses of opioids (\u226430 mg oral morphine equivalents/day) for reduction of symptoms in those patients with severe COPD receiving long-term oxygen therapy. Low dose opioids are not associated with an increased risk of hospital admission or death in cohorts of COPD patients on long term oxygen therapy. On the contrary, benzodiazepines and opioids at higher doses might increase mortality.",

They show similar cytotoxic and antitubulin activity compared to combretastatin A-4 in neuroblastoma cells, showing a better pharmacokinetic profile. This class of compounds has therefore the potential for further development as antitubulin agents.",

The epileptogenic zone was found to be related with a tuber situated on the left inferior frontal gyrus. The effects of high doses of zonisamide simulate a disturbance of eloquent cortex within the epileptogenic zone and the impact of uncontrolled seizures on cognitive functioning over the language-dominant hemisphere. Drug withdrawal significantly improved total intelligence index, verbal comprehension intellectual index and specific language-sustained cognitive abilities, beyond practice effects.",

    "208": "Objetivo. Documentar el deterioro cognitivo reversible asociado a altas dosis de zonisamida, utilizando indices de cambio fiable para controlar los efectos de practica derivados de evaluaciones neuropsicologicas repetidas. Caso clinico. Ni\u00f1o de 11 a\u00f1os con complejo esclerosis tuberosa y epilepsia refractaria del lobulo frontal izquierdo, evaluado en el contexto de un programa de cirugia de la epilepsia pediatrica. La zona epileptogena se relaciono con un tuber epileptogeno localizado en el giro frontal inferior del hemisferio izquierdo. Los efectos de altas dosis de zonisamida mimetizaron una afectacion de la corteza elocuente en la zona epileptogena y un impacto de las crisis no controladas en el funcionamiento cognitivo asociado al hemisferio dominante para el lenguaje. La retirada del farmaco mejoro significativamente, mas alla de los efectos de practica, el cociente intelectual total, el indice intelectual de comprension verbal y habilidades cognitivas especificas sustentadas en el lenguaje. Conclusiones. La diferenciacion entre los efectos cognitivos de los farmacos y la existencia de un deficit funcional por afectacion de la corteza elocuente en el area epileptogena puede ser crucial para la toma de decisiones en cirugia de la epilepsia.", 
    "209": "Acute repetitive seizures (ARS) are a serious epilepsy phenomenon, generally described as closely grouped seizures over minutes to 2 days, representing an increase in seizure frequency compared with baseline. In some instances, ARS may not stop without treatment, and evolution into status epilepticus is a significant concern. Additionally, neuronal injury may occur after even brief repeated seizures. Given the substantial risks that may be involved with ARS, it is crucial to develop appropriate protocols for identification and management of this seizure phenomenon. This article focuses on pharmacotherapy and, in particular, different modes of administering medication for ARS in the outpatient setting. Our aim was to present a review of data from non-randomized and randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of out-of-hospital ARS treatments. Several of the studies included patients with ARS, as well as patients with prolonged seizures. Prolonged seizures, or seizures lasting greater than 5 min, have similar risks and treatment options to those of ARS; therefore, this discussion also includes treatment trials and recommendations for prolonged seizures. All trials used benzodiazepines, a class of drugs that are ideal for the ARS and prolonged seizure populations because of their rapid onset of action and minimal adverse effects. Rectal diazepam is currently the only formulation approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for out-of-hospital treatment. Oral benzodiazepines are appropriate only for mild ARS. Intramuscular diazepam autoinjection has shown success against ARS in clinical trials. Intranasal midazolam and diazepam are in testing. Other treatments have also been explored--specifically, buccal midazolam (approved in the European Union), sublingual lorazepam and intranasal lorazepam."
