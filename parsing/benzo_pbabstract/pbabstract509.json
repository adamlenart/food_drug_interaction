    "0": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic and marked amnestic properties. Due to an excellent local tolerability, its slight reduction in blood pressure and minor dose-related respiratory depression, midazolam is useful for anaesthetic induction and postoperative (long-term) sedation especially for intensive care patients. Compared to other benzodiazepines, midazolam exhibits a rapid onset of action and a fast hepatic elimination (t1/2 2 to 4h; CL 400 to 600 ml/min). In patients with liver cirrhosis and critically ill patients, an impaired elimination and longer duration of action has to be taken into consideration. Likewise, in the elderly an amplified response will be noted, because of the increased sensitivity of the central nervous system to benzodiazepines during aging. In such populations at risk, \"normal\" dosage of midazolam has to be reduced at least by factor 2.", 
    "1": "A gas-liquid chromatography method for unchanged clonazepam determination in plasma using a nitrogen-phosphorus detector is presented. The drug is extracted from buffered plasma at pH 9.0 with benzen. The proposed method is simple, rapid and permits to determine clonazepam with a good precision (delta = 3.10 p. cent) and reproductibility (CV = 3.04 p. cent). The method allows the determination of other benzodiazepins. Plasmatics levels of inchanged clonazepam had been determined on some clinical cases.", 
    "2": "The effects of two benzodiazepine anticonvulsants clobazam (20 mg) and clonazepam (2 mg) in a variety of psychomotor performance tests were compared in a placebo controlled double-blind acute oral dose study in ten healthy volunteers. Assessments included critical flicker fusion (CFF) threshold, the Sternberg memory scanning and choice reaction time (CRT), peak saccadic velocity (PSV) and visual analogue scales, all previously shown to be sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. Clobazam did not significantly impair saccadic eye movements, CFF threshold, Sternberg memory scanning and CRT compared to placebo. Clonazepam significantly lowered PSV, reduced the CFF threshold, slowed the Sternberg CRT and decreased an alertness factor in the visual analogue scales compared to placebo. Clonazepam significantly increased memory scanning time compared to clobazam. Clobazam was remarkably free of cognitive and psychomotor side-effects.",

Acidity and protein digestion were determined in vitro with 3 values of the substrate pH. It was established that almagel and food efficiently reduced the acidity and protein digestion in the stomach and duodenum. Gastrocepin decreased those indicators to a lesser degree but throughout a longer period of time. The data obtained can be used for optimizing the treatment of patients suffering from duodenal ulcers.", 
    "4": "The goals of premedication in obstetric anaesthesia with particularly high risk due to high maternal morbidity and mortality are: reduction of preoperative apprehension, psychological preparation by adequate evaluation and an extensive clinical round, prevention of aspiration of gastric contents, administration of antacids, H-2-receptor-blocking and gastrokinetic agents. Due to their rapid passage across the placenta, opioids, benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs may influence the newborn and so arguments for and against must be considered individually. Despite all measures, the high anaesthesiological risk remains, since there is no \"safe\" gastric content regarding amount an pH. Anaesthetic technique and the experience of the anaesthetist play a significant role.", 
    "5": "Many of the drugs used in anesthesia and intensive care may cause blockade of the central cholinergic neurotransmission. Acetylcholine is of significance in modulation of the interaction among most other central transmitters. The clinical picture of the central cholinergic blockade, known as the central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS), is identical with the central symptoms of atropine intoxication. This behaviour consists of agitation including seizures, restlessness, hallucinations, disorientation or signs of depression such as stupor, coma and respiratory depression. Such disturbances may be induced by opiates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, ketamine, etomidate, propofol, nitrous oxide, and halogenated inhalation anesthetics as well as by H2-blocking agents such as cimetidine. There is an individual predisposition for CAS--but unpredictable from laboratory findings or other signs. Reports of postanesthetic occurrence of the CAS requiring treatment are not unanimous, varying between 1 and 40%. Differential diagnosis of the CAS includes disorders of glucose and electrolyte metabolism, severe hormonal imbalance, respiratory disorders (hypoxia, hypercarbia), hypothermia, hyperthermia and neuropsychiatric diseases (cerebral hypoxia, stroke, catatony, acute psychosis). The CAS may considerably impair the postanesthetic period especially when agitation is prevalent, which may endanger the patient or the surgical results. The diagnosis is confirmed ex iuvantibus by the sudden increase in the acetylcholine level in the brain. This is achieved with physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor able to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Its peripheral muscarinic effects are minimal. Postanesthetic CAS can be prevented by administration of physostigmine during the anesthesia procedure. During intensive care (IC), agitated forms of CAS may occur in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, particularly during prolonged high-dose sedation. Artificial ventilation of such patients becomes very difficult and muscle relaxation may be necessary. In these cases of IC-CAS, physostigmine is of value and has proven beneficial during weaning from mechanical ventilation. Dealing with the CAS for more than a decade has improved knowledge of the central cholinergic transmission. For example, it can be said that CAS occurs alongside general anesthesia, being no more than a frequent side-effect. Furthermore, acetylcholine is involved in nociception through the endorphinergic and the serotoninergic systems. There is a close relation between the central cholinergic transmission and actions of nitrous oxide. Moreover, cholinergic transmission is involved in withdrawal from (among others) alcohol, opiates, hallucinogens and nitrous oxide. In some intoxications with psychoactive agents, physostigmine is useful for reversal of the central nervous symptoms of the acute intoxication itself. In addition it can be used for prevention of some withdrawal states. In",

Typically, delirium is multifactorial in etiology and a complete evaluation to rule out all treatable, contributable medical conditions should be the first stage in the approach to a delirious AIDS patient. While a search for probable cause is underway, the next goal of treatment should be sedation. To help clinicians recognize and manage delirium in advanced HIV disease, we describe our experience with 206 AIDS patients.", 
    "7": "The effects of zopiclone (7.5 mg/per os/day), a new non-benzodiazepine drug, on anxiety levels, time of sleep induction, hours of sleep, number of nocturnal arousals, quality of sleep and of daytime arousal were evaluated by using psychometric ratings. A random double-blind cross-over study versus nitrazepam (5.0 mg/per os/day) was performed on 20 patients affected by insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder (DSM III-R). The effects were evaluated by using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the Toulouse-Pieron Attention Test and a time-signed quantitative scale for anxiety. The results of the trial confirmed the effectiveness of zopiclone in the treatment of insomnia with effects similar to nitrazepam on the quality and duration of sleep and number of nocturnal arousals, but with an improvement in all the other parameters.", 
    "8": "In order to compare the safety and the antiemetic effectiveness of tetracosactide (TCS) or beta 1,24 ACTH with those of dexamethasone (DXM) as an adjunct to high-dose metoclopramide, diphenhydramine and clorazepate, 33 patients receiving cisplatin based cancer chemotherapy were enrolled in a double-blind cross-over clinical trial. TCS and DXM were given intravenously, respectively at a dose of 2 mg and 20 mg, and concurrently to the cisplatin infusion. No statistically significant difference was noted between the two drugs with regard to efficacy or side effects. We conclude that TCS can serve as a substitute for DXM in combination antiemetic regimens for management of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting.", 
    "9": "Cultured neurons of chick cerebral embryo hemispheres were used to study drug effects against neuronal damage caused by hypoxia during long-term recovery. Sodium cyanide (NaCN, 1 mmol/l) induces hypoxia-like conditions by inhibiting oxydative phosphorylation. The sensitivity of the cultured neurons against this type of hypoxia was determined after 3, 4, 5 and 6 days of cultivation followed by 4, 3, 2 days and 1 day of recovery, respectively. The ATP level and the viability of cells as well as the total cell number and the protein content of the cultures were used to characterize the extent of posthypoxic neuronal damage. A hypoxic period of 30 min after 4 days of cultivation followed by 3 days of recovery seemed to be appropriate for determining protective drug effects. The drug effects obtained were comparable to those from in vivo models of cerebral ischemia or hypoxia. The results suggest that cultured neurons exposed to hypoxia and to long-term recovery could be suitable for studying post-hypoxic neuronal damage as well as neuroprotective drug effects.", 
    "10": "Benzodiazepines are potent and effective drugs for the management of acute seizures and status epilepticus. Lorazepam, diazepam, and clonazepam have been the most widely studied of the benzodiazepines in the treatment of status epilepticus. In 47 studies of these drugs involving 1,455 patients, lasting control of status epilepticus was achieved in 79% of the patients. None of these benzodiazepines is clearly superior to another for the effective control of status epilepticus. Differences in pharmacokinetic parameters, therefore, will influence the choice of drug. All three benzodiazepines are lipid-soluble and enter the brain within seconds to minutes after intravenous administration. Diazepam, however, is very lipid-soluble and highly protein-bound and thus has a very large volume of distribution of unbound drug. As a result, the effective duration of action of diazepam in status epilepticus is only 20 to 30 min, whereas that of lorazepam, which has a much smaller volume of distribution of unbound drug, is at least several hours after a single intravenous injection. This allows the orderly administration of an antiepileptic drug for long-term seizure control after status epilepticus has been controlled. For this reason, lorazepam is preferable for the initial management of status epilepticus. Continuous intravenous infusion of diazepam has been used successfully in the management of some patients with status epilepticus refractory to initial treatment.", 
    "11": "Clinical trials in children and adults indicate that the intermittent oral or rectal administration of diazepam is an effective and safe alternative for the acute management of recurrent paroxysmal disorders. Prompt home treatment of dangerous or upsetting relapses can prevent the morbid effects of prolonged seizures and offer the patients and their families a sense of control over the illness.", 
    "12": "1. Evidence relating to the role of GABA in the pathogenesis of epilepsy is reviewed. 2. Impaired GABAergic function appears to contribute to seizure susceptibility in a variety of genetically-determined syndromes in animals, e.g. genetically epilepsy prone rats showing sound-induced seizures, gerbils with genetically determined epilepsy, and baboons, Papio papio, with photosensitive epilepsy. 3. In epilepsy secondary to a cerebral insult there is some morphological and biochemical evidence for impaired GABAergic function in experimental situations, but little definitive evidence in man. 4. Pharmacological approaches to enhancing GABAergic inhibition include the use of GABA agonists (or prodrugs), GABA-transaminase inhibition, GABA uptake inhibition, and action at the GABA/benzodiazepine allosteric site. 5. Experimental data suggest that the best prospect for potent anticonvulsant action with fewest side effects (myoclonus, sedation, ataxia) is at present offered by GABA-transaminase inhibitors or novel agents acting on the benzodiazepine receptor site.", 
    "13": "The plasma oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was evaluated in 20 normal male subjects in the basal state (insulin tolerance test (ITT) alone) and after pretreatment with the muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine (40 mg IV 10 min before the ITT in six subjects), the nicotinic antagonist trimethaphan (0.3 mg/min IV for 30 min before the ITT in six subjects), and the dopaminergic receptor agonist bromocriptine (2.5 mg PO 1 hr before the ITT in eight subjects). The drugs did not modify arterial blood pressure nor produce side effects capable of altering oxytocin secretion. Neither pirenzepine nor trimethaphan administration changed the oxytocin response to hypoglycemia, whereas bromocriptine significantly reduced the oxytocin increase during the ITT. These data suggest the involvement of dopaminergic, but not of cholinergic, muscarinic or nicotinic, receptors in the oxytocin response to hypoglycemia.", 
    "14": "Abrupt cessation of regular use of alcohol in a dependent person causes a withdrawal syndrome that may range from mild to extremely severe. Most patients require pharmacologic intervention, especially those with severe symptoms. Historically, the pharmacotherapy of alcohol withdrawal has involved a wide variety of agents. Benzodiazepines are currently preferred due to their consistently high degree of efficacy and laudable record of safety. In addition, beta blockers and clonidine are useful, as both effectively combat the hypertension and tachycardia commonly associated with withdrawal. They are ineffective as anticonvulsants; however. Opinions differ concerning the best treatment for withdrawal seizures. Prophylaxis with benzodiazepines may be all that is required, although some authors advocate the use of phenytoin for 5 days, especially in persons with a history of prior seizures during alcohol withdrawal. Once established, delirium tremens are difficult to treat. Benzodiazepines are most commonly used to provide sedation, and extremely large doses may be required. Careful clinical assessment is essential to the proper treatment of patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal since the coexistence of medical problems may complicate the condition.", 
    "15": "1. Efficacy and safety of tetrabamate and chlordiazepoxide in the treatment of the acute or Primary Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS) were assessed during a randomized double blind clinical trial, carried out on sixty male alcoholic in-patients. 2. The two drugs were administered four times a day in double dummy conditions, according to a fixed-flexible decreasing dosage schedule (six days basic regimen). 3. Drug efficacy was measured daily throughout the study period using a battery of standard instruments for collecting quantitative clinical, behavioral, psychopathological and laboratory data. Side effects were daily recorded. 4. Tetrabamate was found to be as efficient as chlordiazepoxide in reducing the intensity of the PAWS, improving sleep and vital signs rapidly and alleviating anxiety progressively. 5. Tetrabamate was found particularly beneficial for severe tremor. Psychomotor and mood scores consistently favored tetrabamate, suggesting psychoanaleptic properties of this compound (increased diurnal vigilance). 6. Side effects were minimal with tetrabamate and generally of weak intensity with chlordiazepoxide. 7. The results of this study indicate that tetrabamate may represent a new alternative drug of choice for the therapy of the acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "16": "Sixty women were asked to fill in questionnaires about their subjective feelings of anxiety when undergoing mammary operations. Every operation puts the patient under emotional stress, whereas anxiety is mainly caused by anaesthesia, operation and rehabilitation. It was possible to show that oxazepam has a significant effect in view of the reduction of the anxiety factor. The largest emotional stress is very obvious 2 hours before introducing anaesthesia when no placebo was administered in the premedication. Our patients showed the lowest degree of anxiety on the third postoperative day. In spite of pharmacological premedication it will always remain the task of the anaesthetist during his preoperative round to pay attention to the psychological situation of the patient especially with regard to anxiety.", 
    "17": "Three of the acute hepatic porphyrias, acute intermittent porphyria, variegata porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, are characterized by an idiosyncratic reaction to many common drugs; the resulting excessive excretion of porphyrin precursors is responsible for episodes of acute neurological dysfunction. This review aimed to focus the attention of the anaesthesiologist on the porphyrinogenic properties of all the drugs used in anaesthesia and intensive care. An outline of the chemistry of porphyrins and the enzymatic pathways were recalled, so as to place the acute porphyrias in their proper perspective. There follows a reminder of the clinical aspect of acute porphyric crises. The part played by drugs is then assessed from clinical and laboratory data concerning their porphyrinogenicity. Those drugs for which there is conflicting evidence regarding their safe use in porphyric patients are discussed: propofol, ketamine, benzodiazepines, etomidate, local anaesthetics. Recommendations supported by clinical and experimental data are given, especially the results obtained with the chick embryo liver model. Treatment of the acute crisis is provided, with particular emphasis on the use of haematin. The anaesthetic management of hepatic porphyric patients is described. Those drugs which are well-known porphyrinogenic compounds in the chick embryo liver must be excluded from use for anaesthesia in the porphyric patients, even if they have been observed to be innocuous in rare cases of asymptomatic patients. Finally, recommendations for anaesthesia in symptomatic cutanea porphyria are given.", 
    "18": "This paper reviews the pharmacokinetic modifications of anaesthetic intravenous drugs in elderly reported in the literature. With benzodiazepines, the elimination half-life is prolonged and can increase the duration of the sedative effect. With hypnotics, the increase of pharmacological effect (intensity and duration) is due to a decrease of initial volume of distribution and total body clearance. Except morphine, the pharmacokinetic of opioids is slightly changed and can't explain the increase of the pharmacodynamic sensibility.", 
    "19": "In 123 patients the peculiarities of formation and effectiveness of insulin coma (IC) were studied under drug therapy as compared with 49 drug-free patients. Pharmacotherapy preceding the ICs produced uneven effect on its course. Artefact course of IC was most frequently observed after mageptil, chlorpromazine melipramine treatment, and to a lesser extent--after haloperidol, triphtazin, amitriptyline. It was virtually absent after benzodiazepines. The autonomic manifestations in IC and the harmony if its development and clinical picture, markedly changing under drug treatment, were exposed as predictors of the efficiency of IC therapy.", 
    "20": "Effect of quinidine on the hepatic uptake of digoxin was studied using isolated guinea pig hepatocytes and with the multiple indicator dilution method using perfused livers. The initial uptake rate of digoxin by isolated hepatocytes was significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased in the presence of quinidine or ouabain and at low temperature (27 degrees C). The influx rate constant to the liver (K1) of unbound digoxin was also decreased by quinidine or the metabolic inhibitor 2,4 dinitrophenol (DNP) in isolated perfused livers, while K1 of diazepam, which is thought to be taken up by a passive transport system, was not significantly changed in the presence of DNP. These findings suggest that an active transport system for digoxin may exist in the liver and may be inhibited by quinidine. We concluded that the quinidine-induce decreases in the hepatic distribution of digoxin may be attributed both to the decreased tissue binding and to the inhibition of uptake, which might be related to the decreased hepatic clearance.", 
    "21": "Extensive studies have now been carried out demonstrating that the systemic administration of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, can have pronounced effects on both behavioral and endocrine circadian rhythms. For example, three daily injections of triazolam can phase-advance the circadian rhythm of pituitary luteinizing hormone release and locomotor activity by about 2-3 h in female hamsters maintained in constant light. Triazolam has also been found to facilitate the rate of reentrainment of the activity rhythm following an 8-hour advance or delay in the light-dark cycle. Limited studies with other short-acting benzodiazepines indicate that the effects of triazolam on the circadian system of hamsters can be generalized to this class of drugs. Recent studies in humans indicate that treatment with triazolam can alter the time it takes for human endocrine rhythms to become reentrained following an 8-hour delay in the sleep-wake and light-dark cycle. Such findings raise the possibility that short-acting benzodiazepines may prove useful in reducing the symptoms associated with 'jet-lag' and rotating shift-work schedules as well as in the treatment of various physical and mental illnesses that have been associated with a disorder of biological timekeeping.", 
    "22": "In conclusion, it should be repeated that behavioral and cognitive functions in children with epilepsy, as in adults, represent the outcome of multifactorial processes. However, interest has been growing in the role of anticonvulsant drugs as an important variable. Studies in adults have clearly shown the impact of these drugs on both cognitive function and behavior, and the beneficial effects of achieving monotherapy, especially with carbamazepine, have been noted. Extrapolation of these results to children would seem reasonable, and there is some evidence in the literature to support this conclusion. Data in children, however, are complicated by several confounding factors. These include the status of the child under investigation; for example, children with a pre-existing behavior disorder appear to be more susceptible to developing grossly disturbed behavior with medications such as phenobarbital, as opposed to those who at pretreatment assessment do not display abnormalities. Mentally retarded children may be another group specifically susceptible to developing problems with medications. The effect of the anticonvulsant drug on seizure frequency is a complicating variable in interpretation of many investigations: in some patients improvement of seizures leads to improved behavior, while in others the opposite occurs. In some children, behavior exacerbations appear to be provoked by the sudden cessation of seizures, which may occur, for example, in forced normalization associated with barbiturates or benzodiazepines. Serum level monitoring is often not possible in childhood studies because of ethical considerations, and interpreting pharmacokinetic interactions from mere knowledge of orally prescribed agents is hazardous.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "A double-blind controlled study of moclobemide and diazepam in patients with atypical depression showed both to be effective antidepressants and anxiolytics. Statistical comparison showed diazepam to be significantly better than moclobemide at week 4. However, by week 8 there was no significant difference between the two drugs for depression scores although diazepam was a significantly better anxiolytic. Side-effects were minimal, and the most common side-effects emerging for both drugs were sleep disturbance and physical tiredness.", 
    "24": "A study was carried out to compare the evolution of arterial blood pressure during carotid endarterectomy performed under either general anaesthesia (GA) or cervical epidural anaesthesia (CEA). 20 patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups.

In the GA group, patients were anaesthetized with 0.2 mg.kg-1 flunitrazepam and 5 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl; intubation was carried out using 0.08 mg.kg-1 vecuronium, and the patients were ventilated with a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (50% of each). Further injections, every 30 min, of 2 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl were given to the patients in group GA. Blood pressure was monitored continuously, up to 4 h postoperatively, with a radial arterial catheter. Per- or postoperative hypertension was defined as a rise in systolic arterial blood pressure (Pasys) over 180 mmHg for greater than 3 min; this was treated with 20 mg nifedipine intranasally (group CEA) or 100 micrograms fentanyl with 0.5 mg flunitrazepam with or without nifedipine (group GA). Per- or postoperative hypotension was defined as a fall in Pasys below 100 mmHg and or a 30% fall in mean arterial blood pressure for greater than 3 min; this was treated, in both groups, with an intravenous bolus of 3 mg ephedrine.

After a 4 to 7-day wash-out period, patients were allocated at random to receive one or other of the trial medications or placebo over a 4-week period. Mean daily dosages were 24.5 mg for buspirone and 20.8 mg for diazepam (range 10 mg to 60 mg for both drugs). Patients were assessed on entry and at weekly intervals using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and at the end of treatment both patients and physicians gave an overall opinion of response to treatment. Details of adverse events were also recorded. The results showed that both buspirone and diazepam were approximately equal in efficacy and superior to placebo. Menstruation and the occurrence of premenstrual tension did not alter the anxiolytic activity of either drug. Patients taking diazepam had significantly more adverse effects, i.e. drowsiness, weakness, fatigue, inco-ordination and depression, than did those in the buspirone group.

Subjective and objective measures including physiological parameters were recorded to compare the severity of opiate withdrawal between the two groups. No significant difference was found in terms of subjective withdrawal distress between the two treatment conditions, although there was a tendency to a return of withdrawal symptoms in the methadone group towards the end of treatment. A nurse rating scale demonstrated a significantly higher level of withdrawal signs in the chlordiazepoxide group on day 3. Physiological measures suggested that neither group experienced a severe withdrawal illness. A similar number in each group (37%) became completely drug free.", 
    "27": "Anesthetic premedication by injection is usually poorly accepted by children, especially those under 10 years of age. Less disturbing for the child is oral premedication, but this increases the risk of aspiration and must be administered 1.5-2 h before anesthetic induction. This double-blind study was performed in children to investigate the efficacy, acceptance, and general safety of midazolam given rectally. METHOD. Rectal premedication was administered to a total of 80 healthy children between 2 and 10 years of age undergoing elective operations. The children were divided randomly into two groups: group I received 0.4 mg/kg and group II 0.5 mg/kg midazolam with the addition of 0.015-0.02 mg/kg atropine. Premedication was carried out on the pediatric ward. The calculated dose was drawn from the ampule and diluted to 8-10 ml with distilled water. This dose was instilled immediately behind the anal sphincter using a suitable plastic applicator (Stanylan). The following parameters were recorded: immediate reaction to the rectal medication, sedative-hypnotic signs, and acceptance of the anesthetic mask. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured before premedication and before the induction of anesthesia. Observations were made for 5 h post-operatively. Any unusual side effects of the treatment were also noted. The existence of any anterograde amnesia was investigated in 20 children (10 in each group) between 6 and 10 years of age. RESULTS. There was no significant difference between the children allocated to the two groups with regard to age, body weight, sex, type of operation, and duration of anesthesia (Table 2). Of the total of 80 children, 66 (82.5%) accepted the rectal instillation well, 12 (15%) moderately well, and 2 (2.5%) poorly. Signs of respiratory depression or allergic reaction to midazolam were not observed in any case. The observations made before induction of anesthesia are presented in Table 3. The children in group II exhibited significantly greater (P less than 0.05) slurred speech than those in group I. A low incidence of hiccup was seen in both groups. Most of the children (27 in group I, 67.5%; 37 in group II, 92.5%: P less than 0.05) were delivered to the operating room lying down, whereas the others were sitting up in bed but showed no desire to get up. Between 10 and 55 min after the premedication, a total of 5 children (12.5%) in group I and 2 (5%) in group II were restless or crying on arrival in the induction room. Most, however, were quiet to tired/drowsy. The optimal sedative-hypnotic action was observed after 20-30 min (Fig. 1). At this time 21.7% of the children in group I were tired/drowsy, whereas 50% in group II were tired/drowsy and 9.1% were asleep but easy to arouse. This effect was significantly greater in group II (P less than 0.01). Acceptance of the mask was comparable in both groups (Table 4) and was tolerated well to very well by 92-97% of the children.

    "28": "In a double-blind randomised study, we examined if pretreatment with small doses of midazolam, given before anaesthesia induction with fentanyl, influences the occurrence of fentanyl-induced thoracic rigidity (FITR). At the same time, the effect of rigidity on the cardiovascular and respiratory system was assessed. Sixteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were divided into two groups. The midazolam group (M) received 0.075 mg/kg midazolam i.v. and the placebo group (P) NaCl 0.9% 3 min before the start of fentanyl induction. During the induction period, FITR was assessed clinically on a 3-point scale. Haemodynamic and respiratory variables were collected before anaesthesia induction, at the end of the fentanyl infusion and 3 min after intubation. The incidence of FITR was high in both groups: 63% in Group M and 75% in Group P (n.s.); however, its severity was less in Group M. The appearance of rigidity affected the cardiovascular and the respiratory system: central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures showed a sharp increase in patients with FITR accompanied by CO2 retention, due to an inability to ventilate these patients adequately. We conclude that small doses of midazolam do not prevent, but may attenuate, FITR and that the appearance of rigidity causes alterations of haemodynamic and respiratory variables during induction.",

We report here that an endogenous, intracellular factor alters the affinity of selective antagonists for muscarinic receptors in the heart. Thus, when the intracellular fluid is added back to rat heart membranes, both pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 bind to two receptor sites. Approximately 30% of the receptors bind pirenzepine with high affinity and AF-DX 116 with low affinity. Thus, while cardiac muscarinic receptors are coded for by a single mRNA and are therefore genetically homogeneous, the resulting receptor protein might behave like a mixture of receptor subtypes in intact tissues due to the influence of intracellular factors on receptor conformation.", 
    "37": "The effects of yohimbine and chlordiazepoxide on locomotor activity in an open field were found to depend on the rat's previous habituation to the test environment: chlordiazepoxide induced a locomotor activation in nonhabituated, but not in habituated rats; yohimbine activated in habituated rats only. In a further study, carried out in the rat's homecage (habituated conditions), the effect of both drugs on competition for sucrose pellets was assessed: yohimbine, but not chlordiazepoxide, helped so-called poor-performing rats to temporarily overcome their typical abstention from competition. The presence or absence of drug effects, obviously depending on the rat's previous familiarization with the test environment, are discussed with view to Gray's concept of the behavioral inhibition system.", 
    "38": "The experiments were performed in the older adult (10-14 months of age) normotensive rats of Wistar strain and in the genetically hypertensive rats which developed Koletsky; the experiments were performed in both sexes. The behavior of control and diazepam treated rats were traced in the holeboard and in the elevated plus-maze. In the control animals when compared to the normotensive rats of both sexes show increase in total time of locomotor-exploratory activity in holeboard. In control animals the lowest level of directed exploration was found in the genetically hypertensive males. The control genetically hypertensive males show also the highest aversion towards open space and hight in the elevated plus-maze. Diazepam increases directed exploration in the genetically hypertensive rats of both sexes; directed exploration in the normotensive rats is not influenced by diazepam or this drug caused decrease. Diazepam shows no effect in between-session habituation of directed exploration in the normotensive rats of both sexes; in the genetically hypertensive rats under diazepam treatment instead of between-session habituation of directed exploration there appears in the second session elevation of directed exploration. Diazepam treatment alleviates in the first session aversion towards open space and hight in the elevated plus-maze only in the genetically hypertensive rats of both sexes and in the normotensive males. In the second session statistically significant alleviation of aversion towards open space and hight was attained in both strains of rats, in both sexes and under the both doses of diazepam. Considering the different markers of aging, stress plasma corticosterone and/or diazepam induced hypothermia show tighter age dependence in the genetically hypertensive rats than in the normotensive rats of Wistar strain. On the other hand, the effect of diazepam on aversion towards open space and hight show closer age dependence in the latter type of rats.", 
    "39": "The effects of i.v. injection of diazepam 0.3 mg/kg and thiopental 6.0 mg/kg on vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) were studied in 9 healthy volunteers. One hour after injection of both diazepam and thiopental VOR gain was reduced and time constant shortened. Four hours after intravenous injection of diazepam the VOR gain was still significantly reduced and had not yet returned to control 8 h after injection. Although both drugs were detected in blood still 8 h after the injection, there were no longer significant effects on VOR. Moreover, individual values of VOR gain and time constant did not correlate with the blood concentrations of the drugs. Decrease of VOR gain and shortening of time constant after i.v. given diazepam and thiopental in man are interpreted as resulting from both specific effects on VOR and non-specific reduction of alertness.", 
    "40": "Most patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), especially early in their treatment, will need pharmacotherapy along with supportive or exploratory psychotherapy. A benzodiazepine anxiolytic will suffice for some. Many require more definitive treatment with an antidepressant or a neuroleptic in low dosage. Those with bipolar II comorbidity may benefit from lithium or, if the irritability component is pronounced, from carbamazepine. In practice, a variety of personality factors and comorbid conditions, over-represented in populations of BPD patients, often complicate the clinical picture. Depending upon the mix of these factors, drugs may have to be avoided, nonstandard combinations of drugs may be necessary, or a safer but less effective drug may have to be substituted for a generally more effective drug whose abuse in a suicidal patient might have more dangerous consequences. Examples of complicating factors, namely premenstrual syndrome (PMS), bulimia, agoraphobia, major affective (including bipolar II manic-depressive) disorder, hypersomnia, and so forth are discussed.", 
    "41": "Studies on the side effects of diazepam on the particularly vulnerable brain of preterm infants have not been done so far. We studied changes of blood flow velocity in the anterior, basilar and internal carotid artery by Doppler technique in 11 preterm infants less than 1,500 g who were given 0.5 mg/kg i.v. diazepam. The flow velocities in the internal carotid and basilar artery did not change significantly and values for carbon dioxide tension, mean arterial blood pressure and HF remained stable. There was a marked increase of flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery. We conclude that diazepam in this dosage does not cause dangerous haemodynamic changes in the premature brain.", 
    "42": "The effect of a benzodiazepine (BDZ), diazepam on human polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) and monocyte phagocytosis and killing from healthy volunteers has been evaluated. Diazepam is able to inhibit in vitro both functions exerted by PMN and monocytes at 10(-5) and 10(-6) M concentrations/ 4 x 10(6) phagocytes. 10(-7) M concentration was not effective in all the instances. These results are discussed for their possible clinical implications, since previous studies have shown that in patients with phobic disorder there is evidence for reduced phagocytosis and killing capacities.", 
    "43": "The effects of three anti-ulcers drugs on the temporal distribution of food intake and of the two parameters, meal size and meal frequency, were studied in ulcerated and non-ulcerated rats exposed to light-dark (LD 12:12) cycles. Experimental ulceration with indomethacin reduces the amplitude of meal frequency and brings the acrophase forward, compared with non-ulcerated animals. These effects were reversed by the oral administration of either ranitidine, sucralfate or pirenzepine along with the food. However, the administration of either pirenzepine or sucralfate alone to non-ulcerated rats is accompanied by significant (P less than 0.05) changes in the circadian patterns of meal size and meal frequency without the total daily food intake being affected in any way (pirenzepine treatment caused large intake of food during the light period while sucralfate treatment resulted in marked food intake during the dark period). The results indicate that circadian modification of meal patterns in the ulcerated rats are attributable to indomethacin-induced gastrointestinal mucosal injury and anti-ulcer medications.", 
    "44": "The water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, was administered epidurally over the lumbar enlargement 18 times to 9 patients with spasticity due to severe spinal cord injury. Doses of 1.25-3.75 mg produced a rapid decrease of spasticity which lasted 1 h. After the maximal reduction of spasticity, the patients became drowsy. While the results suggest a direct action of midazolam on the spinal cord to reduce spasticity, the effect does not contribute to its usefulness as a therapeutic tool.", 
    "45": "Our studies on the effects of subhypnotic doses of midazolam in healthy adult volunteers have been extended with special emphasis on clinical electrophysiological endpoints of sedation and attention coupled with various tests of memory. We measured the many components of the P300 event-related brain potential to infrequent (rare) tones. Midazolam HCl was given in a dose of .02 mg/kg i.v. three times at approximately 15-minute intervals after obtaining baseline electrophysiological recordings and memory test results. Marked individual variation was observed with these small doses of midazolam. Some subjects were markedly sedated, whereas others showed relatively little sedation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) beta activity increased while alpha activity decreased following midazolam. Even though the subjects given midazolam were awake, there was a striking attention deficit that correlated well with the accuracy of counting rare tones and the alterations in various components of the late auditory event-related brain potential.", 
    "46": "A study was carried out on the effects of midazolam 15 mg in conjunction with ethanol 0.5 g/kg on objective and subjective sleep parameters and psychomotor performance in normal subjects. Midazolam significantly decreased total wake time. Total sleep time (TST) increase was related to larger amounts of stage 2 NREM sleep. Ethanol showed similar effects on sleep, although TST increase was associated with nonsignificant increments of NREM sleep and REM sleep. Ethanol slightly potentiated midazolam effects on sleep. Accordingly, total wake time, REM sleep time and number of wakes showed further depression than with midazolam alone. Subjective evaluations showed relatively good correlation with sleep laboratory findings. In addition, the different treatments did not impair subject's psychomotor performance the morning after their administration.", 
    "47": "Since endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) is released after oral administration of camostate, it has been suggested that camostate-induced pancreatic growth is mediated via circulating CCK. To test this concept, we investigated the effects of three potentially inhibitory substances on rat pancreatic hypertrophy caused by feeding of camostate over 2 weeks: (1) L-364,718, the novel specific highly potent nonpeptide CCK receptor antagonist, (2) octreotide (SMS 201-995), a potent long-lasting somatostatin analogue and (3) pancreastatin (33-49), the biologically active C-terminal fragment of the novel gastrointestinal peptide pancreastatin. Camostate feeding (200 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days induced a significant increase in pancreatic weight, total protein, trypsinogen and polyamine levels, whereas total amylase content was substantially diminished. Simultaneous oral or subcutaneous treatment with L-364,718 (0.3 mg/kg twice daily) completely suppressed all trophic effects of camostate. Octreotide (25 micrograms/kg twice daily s.c.) and pancreastatin (33-49) (10 micrograms/kg twice daily s.c.) did not change any trophic parameter. In case of octreotide it could be shown that two daily injections only partially suppressed elevated CCK levels. Pancreatic DNA and putrescine levels were slightly reduced in rats receiving the CCK antagonist alone. These results demonstrate that camostate-induced pancreatic hypertrophy in rats is caused by the release of endogenous CCK which may contribute to the maintenance of normal pancreatic DNA and putrescine concentrations.", 
    "48": "A serum concentration profile study on midazolam in children was done. Fifty six children aged 3-10 years took part. The routes investigated were intravenous, intramuscular, rectal and oral at 0.15 mg.kg-1, and the oral at 0.45 mg.kg-1 and 1 mg.kg-1. Serum concentration levels for 5 h were studied using gas liquid chromatography. The volume of distribution, Vss, was 1.29 l.kg-1, the elimination half-life 1.17 h and the serum clearance 9.11 ml.kg-1.min-1. Peak serum concentrations for the intramuscular, rectal and oral routes were at 15 min, 30 min and 53 min respectively. Bioavailability was 87%, 18%, 27% respectively at a dose of 0.15 mg.kg-1. The oral route bioavailability halved to 15% at the two higher doses. Bioequivalence was present between the 0.15 mg.kg-1 intramuscular dose and the 0.45 mg.kg-1 oral dose from 45 to 120 min.", 
    "49": "The temporal sequence of drug use should reveal which drugs are precursors to heroin and which drugs are used subsequent to the establishment of heroin addiction as adjunctive drugs. This temporal sequence was examined in an epidemiological study. Out of 249 opiate addicts interviewed in the area of Penang, Malaysia, this sequence of drugs could be obtained in 248 cases. The mean (median) age for first use of nicotine is 15.5 (15) years, alcohol 18.4 (18) years, cannabis 17.8 (17) years, heroin 21.8 (21) years, opium 22.8 (22) years, and benzodiazepines 25.8 (25) years. The age of first use of different drug types is presented in some detail. The patterns of sequence of drug use was analyzed for the five major and most frequently reported drugs, i.e. alcohol, cannabis, heroin, opium and benzodiazepines. Nicotine, used as first drug in almost all cases, was omitted in this analysis. A clear trend to multiple drug abuse emerges from this analysis; the biggest number of cases were users of 4 drugs (81 cases), followed by 3 drugs (59 cases) and 5 drugs (58 cases). Thus, nicotine, alcohol and cannabis are precursors of heroin addiction. Other adjunctive drugs become important only after heroin addiction. Among these substances, opium and benzodiazepines are numerically preponderant.", 
    "50": "Using a model of local myocardial ischaemia in the dog, the authors studied the electrostabilizing effect of a combination of the benzodiazepine midazolam (Dormicum Hoffman--La Roche) and the strong narcotic analgesic drug Fentanyl (Richter). The electrostabilizing effect was assessed using the method of ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) measurement. The same increase in the fibrillation threshold as that induced by the administration of midazolam or fentanyl alone was achieved by a combination of both drugs given, however, in reduced doses. The electrostabilizing effect of benzodiazepines and potent analgesics is enhanced by their simultaneous administration. At the same time, the adverse side effects observed on the administration of fentanyl alone (bradycardias, hypotension, cardiac blockade) due to the prevalence of parasympathetic drive, are reduced. Simultaneous administration of a benzodiazepine and an analgesic has become a modern technique, in anaesthesiology, so-called analgosedation. Experiments have shown the technique, in addition to the generally recognized analgesia, sedation and anxiolysis, exerts electrostabilizing effects on the myocardium damaged by ischaemia. The authors therefore recommend analgosedation in the drug treatment of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "51": "Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed in a random sample of 195 men to investigate the relationship between alcohol drinking and brain damage. This sample from the general population was divided into subsamples on the basis of their self-reported loss of control over drinking, morning drinks and blackouts. Three groups with different degrees of alcohol consumption were distinguished and the only differences in CT findings were a significantly higher frequency of frontal lobe atrophy with increasing alcohol consumption. The consumption of hepatotoxic drugs was also investigated and the following were the types of drug used: antiarrhythmics, antiepileptics, antibiotics, antiphlogistics, mixed analgetics, sulphonamides, benzodiazepines and derivatives of phenothiazines, all of which are metabolized by way of the liver. The material was divided into four groups with regard to both alcohol consumption and use of hepatotoxic drugs: Group IA, low or moderate alcohol consumption and no use of such drugs; IB, low or moderate alcohol consumption with use of such drugs; IIA, high alcohol consumption with no use of such drugs; and IIB, high alcohol consumption with use of such drugs. Group IIB was found to have a higher incidence of cortical and subcortical changes than group IA. The results indicate that drug use influences the incidence of cortical and subcortical aberrations. It is concluded that there is a typical frontal lobe atrophy associated with alcohol abuse; thus with increasing alcohol ingestion there is accelerated shrinkage of the brain, the frontal lobe being the first part affected. The groups with alcohol abuse who used hepatotoxic drugs show a picture of cortical changes and also of subcortical aberrations, expressed as an increased anterior horn index and widening of the third ventricle.", 
    "52": "We have investigated the presence of M1-subtype muscarinic receptors on pulmonary vascular endothelium in vivo. Utilizing multiple indicator-dilution techniques, we studied [3H]-pirenzepine ([3H]-PNZ; a selective M1 receptor antagonist) binding during a single transpulmonary pass in anesthetized, artificially ventilated rabbits, before and after administration of 4.3 mumol/kg of the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. [14C]-Dextran (MW = 70,000-90,000) served as the intravascular indicator. Before atropine administration, approximately 20% of [3H]-PNZ was lost (i.e., presumed bound to PNZ-specific and nonspecific sites) during a single pass through the pulmonary microvasculature. A significant decrease in [3H]-PNZ binding occurred 90 min after atropine (to approximately 60% of total initial binding), but not after saline, reflecting the loss of specific binding to M1 receptors. These data are in support of previous findings from our laboratory indicating a pressor response to M1 receptor stimulation in the rabbit pulmonary circulation as well as an endothelium-dependent contractile response to M1 receptor stimulation in vitro.", 
    "53": "The interaction with nitrous oxide analgesia of drugs that act at the benzodiazepine receptor was evaluated in the rat tail flick model. Nitrous oxide produced dose-related analgesia, which was potentiated by diazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist, antagonized by noreleagnine, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 blocked the effects of both diazepam and noreleagnine on nitrous oxide analgesia. Subanesthetic doses of sodium pentobarbital and chloral hydrate produced nonsignificant trends to reduce the analgesic action of nitrous oxide. These data provide evidence for the presence of specific benzodiazepine receptors capable of modulating the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide.", 
    "54": "The ontogeny of striatal M1 and M2 muscarinic cholinergic binding sites was studied autoradiographically in cats ranging in age from embryonic day 40 to postnatal day six. Direct labeling with [3H]pirenzepine revealed M1 sites, and M2 sites were labeled with [3H]N-methylscopolamine in the presence of pirenzepine. In serial tissue sections, distributions of striatal M1 and M2 sites were compared to one another and to patterns of acetylcholinesterase staining and tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity. The younger fetal material demonstrated heterogeneous distributions for both subtypes of muscarinic binding sites, with patches of dense binding corresponding to islands of dopaminergic nigrostriatal innervation. For both M1 and M2 binding, lateral to medial and caudal to rostral density gradients were present in the patches and in the surrounding matrix. During fetal development and into the perinatal period, overall muscarinic binding increased, but more so in the matrix than in the patches. By postnatal day six striatal M2 binding appeared nearly homogeneous. M1 binding, however, was slightly more concentrated in patches than in matrix. The patches of elevated M1 binding were still present at maturity, and corresponded to striosomes. These findings suggest that the ontogenetic regulation of muscarinic binding sites is influenced by location relative to striatal compartments, and that expression of M1 and M2 binding site subtypes is differentially regulated.", 
    "55": "In parts I-III of this series psychometric evidence was reported of a \"psychotic motor syndrome\" (PMS) in schizophrenic and endogenous depressed patients, which was not found in non-endogenous depressed or healthy persons. An attempt is reported to establish signs of brain dysfunction in these patient groups during motor activation, using a 16-channel EEG mapping system. \"Resting\" conditions after a special relaxation procedure were compared with simple and complex motor tasks (and music perception/reproduction; to be reported separately). Two measurements, at least 2 weeks apart, were obtained for each subject, in order to obtain information on the influence of drug treatment and/or psychopathological improvement on brain dysfunction. In all, 23 male and 25 female schizophrenics, 11 male and 18 female non-endogenous depressed patients (not actually mediated, i.e. drug naive or wash-out period of 1 week to 17 years), and 26 male and 37 female endogenous depressed patients (medicated with tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines; no lithium treatment) were compared with 22 male and 17 female control persons (i.e. total n = 179). Major findings were obtained in the delta and alpha frequency bands yielding signs of \"diffuse hyperactivation\" in schizophrenic and endogenous depressed patients as compared with the patterns found in healthy persons. However, since in the non-endogenous patients a (less marked) hyperactivation of various EEG parameters was also found, unspecific effects such as anxiety/arousal may have influenced the results in psychotic patients, which was to be explored further. Drug treatment tended to \"normalize\" the activation pattern both in schizophrenics and endogenous depressed patients. Viewing the findings on schizophrenics using neuroimaging methods [single photon emission computerized tomography-(SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging-(MRI), positron emission tomography-(PET)], these results suggest pathological brain organization connected to an impaired motor performance (evident peripherally as PMS) in schizophrenic and endogenous depressed patients. If it is possible to further \"externally validate\" (by SPECT/MRI/PET) EEG mapping data this method may exclusively offer the possibility of innocuous long-term follow up of brain dysfunction in psychotic patients (\"brain function monitoring\"). This could enable the early recognition (and early therapy) of negative symptoms. Finally, the EEG mapping findings provide further neurophysiological basis for the use of motor training programs in the additional therapy of psychiatric patients.", 
    "56": "Response/log I curves were obtained under conditions of dark-and light-adaptation in seven normal male volunteers. For each subject, a baseline electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded. In the same afternoon, a second ERG was obtained after 0.05 mg/kg diazepam, and a third ERG was recorded following 0.10 mg/kg diazepam. Under conditions of dark-adaptation, the following dose-dependent changes were identified: 1) Diazepam attenuated the rod b-wave peak amplitude and increased its implicit time; 2) The dark-adapted longer wavelength cone a-wave and 'blue cone' b-wave showed an increased implicit time; 3) All oscillatory potentials showed an increased implicit time. Under conditions of light-adaptation, dose-dependent decreases in peak amplitude and delays in implicit time were observed for the a- and b-waves. The effects of diazepam on the human ERG were more profound under conditions of light- than dark-adaptation.", 
    "57": "The effects of triazolam (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg) versus placebo on recovery sleep staging, subsequent alertness and psychomotor performance were evaluated in humans. Forty-five healthy male subjects were deprived of sleep for 24 h, then administered a single dose of triazolam or placebo using a double-blind procedure. Subjects then attempted to obtain recovery sleep under non-sleep-conducive conditions (sitting upright in a well-lit, crowded chamber) for the next 6 h, followed by 18 more hours of sleep deprivation. During all sleep deprivation periods subjects were tested bihourly on a performance assessment battery which included symbol digit modalities tests (SDMT), four-letter search (FLS), logical reasoning (LR), time estimation (TE), visual vigilance (VV), and short term memory (STM) tasks. Sleepiness levels were measured objectively with multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) and subjectively with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS). Compared to placebo, all doses of triazolam resulted in increased amounts of stage 3-4 sleep, and the 0.5 mg dose significantly reduced awakenings (Ps less than 0.05). Although subjects receiving triazolam averaged 21-42 min more total sleep time (TST) than subjects receiving placebo, differences in TST were not statistically significant. Apparent triazolam-mediated benefits to sleep quality resulted in no obvious improvements in performance or alertness levels during subsequent sleep deprivation. It was concluded that the increases in stage 3-4 sleep amounts were most likely due to triazolam-mediated increases arousal thresholds, and the triazolam mediated changes in sleep parameters obtained in the present study were not indicative of substantial changes in the recuperative value of sleep.", 
    "58": "In many animal studies, acute treatment with the novel anxiolytic agent buspirone exhibits only minimal \"anxiolytic efficacy\" (i.e., increases in punished responding) when compared to benzodiazepines and barbiturates. The present studies examined the effects of acute pre-test challenges with buspirone in subjects receiving chronic post-test buspirone or saline treatments. Chronic post-test treatment with buspirone (4 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, followed by 8 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks) did not significantly affect CSD behavior. Consistent with previous reports, acute pre-test administration of buspirone (0.125-2 mg/kg, IP) to subjects receiving chronic post-test saline treatment resulted in only a modest anti-conflict effect in the CSD paradigm (approximately ten shocks over control). In contrast, subjects chronically treated with buspirone exhibited a dramatically greater anti-conflict effect following acute challenge with buspirone (up to 40 shocks over control). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the full anxiolytic efficacy of buspirone requires repeated administration.", 
    "59": "The calcium antagonists nimodipine and dantrolene were compared with diazepam in an animal model of tolerance and physical dependence upon ethanol. Nimodipine and dantrolene were both effective in suppressing withdrawal tremors but diazepam was clearly superior to both agents. These results suggest that the ethanol withdrawal syndrome is only partially mediated by increased calcium flux.", 
    "60": "Since behavioural symptoms (tremor, irritability, pilo-erection and shaking) induced by imidazole (IMID) in rats suggested an underlying modification of arousal and/or emotionality, further studies were performed in order to extend the range of behavioural influences of IMID. In the open-field test, IMID (37.5-300 mg/kg IP) inhibited crossing and rearing in a dose-dependent fashion, this effect being long lasting (about 3 h at 75 mg/kg). Yohimbine (YOH) (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg IP), described as anxiogenic and fear-inducing in animals and in man, when investigated in this same test, inhibited the activity of rats similarly to IMID. Since diazepam (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) but not clonidine (0.075 and 0.150 mg/kg IP) pretreatment reversed IMID- and YOH-induced hypomotility, the hypothesis that IMID effects in the open field might reflect an anxiety-like state was investigated by means of social interaction and x-maze, two tests considered highly specific for anxiety studies. The data obtained show that IMID depresses social interactions only at doses inhibiting motor activity; YOH, in our experimental conditions, produced a similar effect. In an elevated x-maze, with alternate open and closed arms, IMID (37.5 and 75 mg/kg) decreased the proportion of open-arm entries and the time spent in them, an effect prevented by diazepam pretreatment (1 mg/kg IP). Finally, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was assessed in anesthetized rats treated with IMID and YOH at doses equivalent as regards behavioural effects. MAP was increased by IMID whether IP or IV and decreased by YOH; moreover, YOH, as expected, antagonized clonidine-induced hypotension, while IMID was ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "The reinforcing effects of diazepam (DZ), triazolam (TZ) and placebo were examined in eight male subjects with histories of sedative abuse. DZ (40 or 80 mg), TZ (1.0 or 2.0 mg) and placebo were each individually available for oral self-administration using a double-blind within-subject design. After an initial sampling exposure, subjects could self-administer a single dose of drug on each of 6 days by completing a progressively increasing bicycle riding requirement. All subjects initially self-administered DZ and TZ but a decreasing number of subjects continued to self-administer drugs on the remaining days; there was no difference between DZ and TZ in the total number of self-administrations. Placebo was self-administered only by one subject on two occasions. Performance measures showed that TZ produced greater memory impairment than DZ and that DZ produced residual psychomotor impairment on the next day. With repeated dosing, evidence of tolerance was seen for both drugs on psychomotor and memory performance and subject ratings of drug liking. A few modest correlations of drug self-administration and subject-ratings were obtained, suggesting some correspondence of subject verbal and drug self-administration behaviors, but these measures did not covary in a completely consistent manner.", 
    "62": "A study on psychotropic drug monitoring was carried out in Verona over a 2-week period using information obtained during consultation with 3 GPs. Psychotropic drugs accounted for 23.4% and 24.3% of all prescriptions in men and women respectively. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently prescribed: 76% and 72% of all psychotropic prescriptions respectively in women and in men. No significant association between psychotropic drug prescription and age, sex, marital status and occupation was found in the present survey. In men only, those patients with higher educational level were more likely to receive a prescription for psychotropic drugs than those with a lower educational level. About 70% of men and 60.4% of women diagnosed by the GP as having a psychiatric problem were prescribed a psychotropic drug. However, the probability of a psychotropic being prescribed, when a psychiatric problem is identified by the GP, was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in men than in women: odds ratio 39.37 and 16.33 respectively. Psychotropic drugs were prescribed in 35% of men and in about 48% of women in which a social problem was identified by the GP. Women were about 5 times more likely to receive a prescription than men: odds ratio 12 and 2.75 respectively. A significant influence of physical ill-health and educational level on psychotropic prescription emerged: both effects were independent of sex, psychiatric morbidity and social problems. Using a logistic regression analysis, an interactive effect between sex and conspicuous psychiatric morbidity and between sex and social problems was also found.", 
    "63": "We reviewed our experience with ESWL therapy in 96 patients who presented with upper, middle and lower ureteral calculi; we had 127 treatments in 96 patients, 73 men (76%) and 22 women (24%). All the treatments were performed without general anesthesia and without premedication. The average number of shock waves was 3.000. Repetition of the ESWL therapy had to be performed in 25%.", 
    "64": "Data from different analyses of reported deaths from overdose with antidepressants in the U.K. reveal that amitriptyline and dothiepin are the antidepressants most likely to be associated with death from overdose. All widely used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) except clomipramine and lofepramine appear to be dangerous in overdose, whereas the newer antidepressants such as mianserin, trazodone, viloxazine and the TCA lofepramine appear to be relatively safe. The toxicity of amitriptyline and dothiepin appears to be greater than all antidepressants including other TCAs and it is important to try to understand why. A number of explanations will be considered: 1. Dothiepin and amitriptyline may be inherently more toxic than other TCAs. 2. Dothiepin and amitriptyline may induce suicide more than other antidepressants. It is assumed that antidepressants are neutral with regard to inducing suicide but this may not be true. There is, for example, evidence that alprazolam and other benzodiazepines induce suicidal behaviour. 3. Amitriptyline and dothiepin are often presented in subtherapeutic and ineffective doses and it is possible that increased suicides may result from inadequately treated depression. 4. There may be a selective overreporting of deaths with amitriptyline and dothiepin. 5. Amitriptyline and prothiaden may be selectively given to the suicide prone on the mistaken assumption that they are safe.", 
    "65": "The per-operative plasma prolactin levels in 16 male patients undergoing plastic-reconstructive surgery were studied. 8 patients received chlordesmethyldiazepam 0.1 mg/kg-1 i.v. (group C), 8 sodium thiopental 5 mg/kg-1 i.v. (Group T) in anaesthesia induction. All patients were premedicated by diazepam 0.15 mg/kg-1 by mouth 90 min. before anaesthesia induction and atropine 0.007 mg/kg-1 i.v. just before induction, and received succinylcholine 1 mg/kg-1 i.v. and an endotracheal tube for mechanically controlled ventilation. Anaesthesia maintenance was assured by isoflurane 0.5-2.5% in a N2/O2 (2/1) gas mixture. Blood samples were collected from each patient at the following times; 24 h before surgery (t0); 30 min after skin incision (t1); 30 min after extubation (t2). Significant variation of blood prolactin levels are not been shown.", 
    "66": "The clinical efficacy of drug treatment for panic disorder has been evaluated in several studies, especially in the last decade. In this paper we reviewed double-blind controlled clinical trials of antidepressants and benzodiazepines in the treatment of panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants (principally imipramine) and benzodiazepines were equally effective in reducing panic symptomatology. This evidence does not support the hypothesis that panic-related symptomatology is a psychopathological entity, requiring a specific antidepressant drug treatment. The combination of psychological therapy with drug treatment was associated with even better outcome. On the other hand, the efficacy of MAOI remains to be demonstrated. Better compliance with benzodiazepines may favor the clinical use of these drugs rather than antidepressants. However, more prospective controlled studies including follow-up examinations are required, in order to assess the risk/benefit ratio of these treatments after long-term therapy.", 
    "67": "Three anxiolytic drugs (bromazepam 3 mg, buspirone 10 mg, and clobazam 10 mg p.o.) were evaluated for their effects on memory, psychomotor performance and subjective response in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 20 healthy volunteers. At each session, measurements were made before and 2 and 6 h after drug administration. The psychometric tests used were the images test, digit/symbol substitution test (DSST), choice reaction time (CRT), and critical fusion frequency (CFF). Free recall after 30 s in the 2-hour session was altered for all 3 drugs as compared to placebo (p less than 0.01), but in the 6-hour session only bromazepam showed a significant difference (p less than 0.05). The number of symbols reproduced by subjects during DSST was significantly decreased by bromazepam and buspirone as compared to placebo (p less than 0.05), whereas clobazam showed no differences with placebo. Analysis of variance for all four treatments (the 3 drugs and the placebo) showed no differences at recognition time or for motor response in CRT, except between bromazepam and clobazam after 6 h (p less than 0.05). None of the drugs altered performance during CFF (except bromazepam), and clobazam actually improved performance. All the drugs studied disturbed acquisition phenomena or restitution of memory; however, only bromazepam and buspirone significantly modified performance during DSST and disturbed the recognition and processing of sensory data.", 
    "68": "In this study effects of temazepam on the EEGs of 10 healthy volunteers were detected using a standardized EEG registration procedure applied in a controlled environment. The EEGs were recorded both before and after administration of 20 mg temazepam as well as before and after placebo. A mean power spectrum was computed for each EEG from the 'eyes closed' condition, and the Student t test was used to detect differences in the spectra of the pre- and posttreatment EEGs in both placebo and drug conditions. For all 10 subjects the drug condition was easily distinguishable from the placebo condition based on the results of the t test.", 
    "69": "Intraperitoneal injection to mice of platelet-activating factor (PAF) induces severe shock symptoms, leading to death. The effects of various drugs which are potential specific or non-specific PAF inhibitors were tested. Salbutamol, a beta 2-agonist, showed a partial protection, whereas the specific PAF antagonists CV 3988 or BN 52021 induced an important beneficial action against PAF-induced lethal effects. The effects of drugs related to benzodiazepines were also studied: alprazolam administered p.o. prior to PAF challenge provides almost complete protection against PAF toxicity. Thus PAF-induced death in mice represents a useful model of systemic anaphylaxis; moreover, studies of benzodiazepine-related compounds may be interesting for investigating the mechanisms of the biological actions of PAF.", 
    "70": "A method has been developed for gas-chromatographic determination of clobazam in human plasma using a nitrogen-selective detector. The unchanged drug was extracted from the plasma at pH 9 by benzene. The method used methyl-1-clonazepam as internal standard. Calibration graphs were linear in the range of 20 to 10,000 ng/ml. The recovery of the compound was 102.29%. The sensitivity of the method was adequate for determination of the drug at toxic concentrations and at therapeutic doses. It was a simple, rapid, reproductible method for determination of clobazam and most of the commercialized benzodiazepines. The method has been tested in a few number of clinicals cases. No interferences occurred in plasma from patients treated with various drugs.", 
    "71": "Chronic exposure to cannabis extract or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been reported to produce hippocampal neuropathology in rats, as well as classical \"hippocampal\" behavioral deficits. In an attempt to replicate and extend these findings, male rats were exposed to THC for 13 consecutive weeks, beginning in early adolescence. Drugs were administered five consecutive days a week (Monday through Friday). There were five dose levels: vehicle control, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, p.o., and 20 mg/kg THC four days a week (Monday-Thursday), followed by 60 mg/kg on Friday. Following THC exposure, all animals were withdrawn from drugs for seven weeks prior to behavioral testing. Three behavioral tasks previously shown to be sensitive to hippocampal damage were assessed. These were habituation of open-field activity, 24-hr passive avoidance response retention, and complex maze performance. A fourth task, emergence latency, was also included because it has been determined to be sensitive to \"anxiety\" levels. To facilitate interpretation of the complex maze data, two additional experiments are also reported. One experiment tested rats exposed to trimethyltin (TMT, a potent hippocampal neurotoxicant) on the complex maze. The second assessed the affects of chronic/acute benzodiazepine (BZ) exposure upon maze performance. Test results did not suggest that chronic THC exposure produced behavioral deficits resembling those seen following hippocampal damage. Habituation rates in an activity monitor were identical for all exposure groups, and there was no passive avoidance retention deficit. Further, while TMT caused pronounced abnormalities in the complex maze, chronic THC exposure at the two highest dose levels significantly improved maze performance, similar to BZ effects on this task. Chronic THC also appeared to reduce freezing on the emergence task, another anxiolytic-like effect. These results support other reports of persistent long-term behavioral effects of chronic THC exposure. However, they suggest that some behavioral effects may more closely resemble the effects of minor tranquilizers rather than hippocampal damage.", 
    "72": "THC is the major psychoactive constituent of marijuana and is also known as an hallucinogenic compound. Numerous reports have shown that large doses of THC produce significant alterations in various neurotransmitter systems. The present study was designed to determine whether chronic exposure to THC produces significant alterations in selected neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, GABAergic, benzodiazepine, and opiate) in the rat brain. In Experiment 1, male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with vehicle, 10 or 20 mg THC/kg body weight daily, 5 days/week for 90 days. Animals were killed either 24 hours or two months after the last dose. Brains were dissected into different regions for neurochemical analyses. Two months after the cessation of chronic administration, there was a significant decrease in GABA receptor binding in the hippocampus of animals in the high dose group. However, no other significant changes were found in neurotransmitter receptor binding characteristics in the hippocampus or in neurotransmitter concentrations in the caudate nucleus, hypothalamus or septum after chronic THC administration. In an attempt to replicate the GABA receptor binding changes and also to determine the [35S]TBPS binding in hippocampus, we designed Experiment 2. In this experiment, we dosed the animals by gavage with 0, 5, 10 or 20 mg THC/kg daily, 5 days/week or with 20 mg THC/kg Monday through Thursday and 60 mg/kg on Friday for 90 days. Results from this experiment failed to replicate the dose-dependent effect of THC on GABA receptor binding in hippocampus. Modulation of [35S]TBPS binding by GABA or 3 alpha-OH-DHP or inhibition by cold TBPS in frontal cortex did not show any significant dose-related effects. Results from these experiments suggest that chronic exposure to THC does not produce significant alterations in catecholamine or indoleamine neurotransmitter systems or in opiate or GABA receptor systems in the rat brain.", 
    "73": "This study was designed to compare gastric antisecretory effects of telenzepine, a new antimuscarinic agent, with those of pirenzepine and atropine in dogs. None of these antimuscarinics affected gastric acid secretion induced by histamine but all of them caused a dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion from the gastric fistula (GF) and Heidenhain pouches (HP) stimulated by pentagastrin and bethanechol, telenzepine being 5-9 times more potent than pirenzepine and equipotent with atropine. All antimuscarinics were also effective inhibitors of acid responses to sham feeding and ordinary feeding. The inhibitory effect of telenzepine and pirenzepine were not accompanied by any major alterations in plasma gastrin or somatostatin but those of atropine were related to significant increase in plasma gastrin and to significant decrease in plasma somatostatin levels, suggesting the involvement of M2 receptors in the cholinergic control of these hormones. All three antimuscarinics were effective inhibitors of pepsin secretion induced both from the GF and HP by all secretagogues used. Neither telenzepine nor pirenzepine administered in various doses affected the heart rate while atropine caused a significant increase in heart rate confirming that the former agents are selective M1 receptor antagonists. This study provides evidence that telenzepine is more potent than pirenzepine in the inhibition of gastric secretion induced by pentagastrin, bethanechol, sham-feeding and ordinary feeding and that, unlike atropine, it does not increase plasma gastrin responses to meat feeding. In fact, telenzepine and pirenzepine alike reduced plasma gastrin concentrations under these conditions. No influence of these antimuscarinics on plasma somatostatin levels was observed.", 
    "74": "In rabbit experiments, some drugs used in clinics were selected and combined with electroacupuncture to observe the effect of drugs on acupuncture analgesia (AA). According to the effect of drugs on AA, the drugs were divided into three kinds: (1) Drugs with potentiating effect: fentanyl, pethidine, droperidol, perphenazine, metoclopramide, fenfluramine, tetrahydrocannabinol, fentanyl plus droperidol, fentanyl plus fenfluramine. (2) Drugs with reducing effect: ketamine and diazepam, (3) Drugs with no effect: sulpiride."
