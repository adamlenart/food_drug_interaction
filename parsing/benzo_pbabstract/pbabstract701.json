    "0": "Extrapyramidal symptoms developed a variable time after the start of treatment with oral diazoxide in 15% of a series of 100 severely hypertensive patients. Six illustrative cases are described. Treatment with diazoxide could be continued in four of these. The symptoms are usually controllable either by dosage adjustment or by the use of diazepam or procyclidine. There was no evidence of irreversibility of the extrapyramidal syndromes observed.", 
    "1": "The propagation velocity of evoked muscle spikes was measured and normal values are presented. Carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, diazepam, and bromide-containing drugs were tested for their effect on conduction velocity of motor nerve and skeletal muscle fibres. All these drugs caused a decrease in spike propagation, both of motor nerves and skeletal muscle. After discussion of the probable mode and site of action of these drugs, it was supposed that the underlying events- perhaps changes in permeability of excitable membranes during excitation-are an essential factor in the anticonvulsant action of these drugs.", 
    "2": "Twelve patients acted successfully as subjects to study what effect if any the benzodiazepines nitrazepam, diazepam, oxazepam, and chlordiazepoxide might have on steady-state plasma levels of nortriptyline and amitriptyline. No significant detectable effect was discovered. In view of the known interaction effects of other alternative tranquillizing drugs and hypnotics it seems reasonable to choose benzodiazepines wherever possible when anxiolytics or hypnotics need to be added during treatment of depression with tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "3": "1. The effects of a ;minor' tranquillizer (chlordiazepoxide) on the social behaviour of male golden hamsters were investigated.2. Thirty-six hamsters were divided into pairs. Each pair was placed in an arena measuring 1 m(2); under these conditions the hamsters fought, but once a winner and loser emerged the relationship between the two animals became stabilized. The influence of 50 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide on this stable relationship was investigated and compared with normal behaviour in the arena.3. Under the influence of chlordiazepoxide, hamsters showed a significant reduction in ;aggression', ;defensive fighting' and an increase in ;investigation'.4. When the data for winners and losers were analysed independently, the drug was seen to influence losers more than winners.5. It is postulated that the primary influence of chlordiazepoxide is to reduce fear and as a result ;investigation' is probably affected indirectly as a behaviour pattern suppressed in an individual showing fear of its opponent."
