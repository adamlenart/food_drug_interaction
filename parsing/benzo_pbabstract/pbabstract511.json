There was no difference in the muscimol effects between ethanol-naive alcohol-sensitive and alcohol-insensitive rats. Acute administration of ethanol (2 g/kg, i.p.) and lorazepam (3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the percentage stimulation by muscimol in the alcohol-sensitive animals. The results suggest that genetic selection towards differences in the sensitivity to motor-impairing effects of moderate ethanol doses does not produce alterations in the direct agonist-induced GABAA receptor function. This receptor function was, however, down-regulated in the alcohol-sensitive rats by acute ethanol and benzodiazepine treatments, indicating the involvement of GABAergic activity in the mechanisms of, or in the neural adaptations to, acute intoxication in genetically sensitive animals.", 
    "1": "Preliminary findings regarding the presence of plasmatic benzodiazepine binding inhibitory activity (BBIA) in 14 psychiatric patients prompted us to investigate it further in larger samples of psychiatric patients (n = 44) and in healthy controls (n = 14). The results have shown that BBIA is present in all the subjects included with statistically significant differences between the patients and controls. The highest concentrations were found in the patients with no difference between anxious or depressed patients, and the lowest in the healthy controls. These findings indicate that BBIA might play a role in the pathophysiology of some manifestations of anxiety.", 
    "2": "PK 11195 (or 52028 RP; 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide), an antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors which are coupled to calcium channels, was administered to 10 healthy volunteers in order to study the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular effects of the drug. PK 11195 was randomly administered intravenously (10 mg) and orally in three single dosages (100, 200 and 400 mg). Placebo was only given orally. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at rest and during exercise tests which were performed at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after dosing on each study day. The results showed that after IV administration, PK 11195 was rapidly distributed in two or three open compartments. Its elimination T 1/2 was short (3.7 +/- 3.0 h) with high interindividual variability. After oral ingestion the pharmacokinetics of PK 11195 were linear over the range of 100-400 mg single oral doses with a stable absolute bioavailability (33%). T 1/2 elimination was prolonged (7-12 h) and the presence of secondary increases in plasma concentration at 8-10 h and 22-24 h after drug absorption may have been related to enterohepatic cycling. No unchanged PK 11195 could be detected in urine. PK 11195 did not significantly modify heart rate and blood pressure at rest or during exercise and was well tolerated by the subjects. These data suggest a high inter-individual variability in PK 11195 disposition with extensive metabolism in normal exercising volunteers.", 
    "3": "[3H]-Flunitrazepam (FNT) binding was measured in the post-mortem brains of 13 chronic schizophrenics and 10 controls whose mean ages and death-to-freezing intervals were the same in each group. The specific binding of [3H]-FNT to the medial frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, orbital cortex, medial and inferior temporal gyri, superior temporal gyrus, cornu Ammonis 1-3 and putamen was significantly higher in schizophrenics than in controls. Specific binding to the eye movement area (frontal eye field), motor cortex, lateral occipitotemporal gyrus, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and secondary and tertiary visual cortex did not differ in the two groups. Type 1 benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites in the superior temporal gyrus of schizophrenics, determined from the displacement of [3H]-FNT binding using a triazolopyridazine, CL 218,872 (200 nM), were significantly higher than in the control group. The increase in type 2 BZ binding sites was not significant. Antipsychotic or benzodiazepine medication did not appear to affect the results. There were significant correlations between specific [3H]-FNT binding and concentration of GABA (positive) and of glutamic acid (negative), specific [3H]-kainic acid binding (positive), activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (positive), and substance P-like immunoreactivity (positive) in many areas of the brain. The Bmax of [3H]-spiperone binding in the putamen was also correlated positively with specific [3H]-FNT binding. These data suggest that dysfunction of BZ receptors may be involved in the pathogenesis and some symptoms of chronic schizophrenia.", 
    "4": "Effect of clonidine, a presynaptic adrenoceptor agonist, on the schedule-controlled performance action of two benzodiazepine receptor agonists was assessed in rats in a fixed-ratio (FR6) procedure. Diazepam (0.03 approximately 1.0 mg/kg), an agonist of both type I and II benzodiazepine receptors, decreased the FR performance in a dose-dependent manner. Clonidine (10 micrograms/kg) significantly potentiated the action of diazepam when the dose of diazepam was increased to 0.1 mg/kg. However, clonidine did not show any potentiating effect on the mild depressive action of CL 218,872, a special agonist of type I benzodiazepine receptor until its dose was increased to 10 mg/kg. The Potentiating effect of clonidine on the depressive action of diazepam was significantly antagonized by yohimbine. Bicuculline (3.0 mg/kg) significantly antagonized the depressive action of diazepam (1.0 mg/kg). Our results suggest that the depressive action of benzodiazepines on the function of central noradrenaline system may be one of the benzodiazepine sedative mechanisms, which may be related to the type II benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "5": "The adult male baboons were trained on a psychophysical procedure to discriminate five synthetic, steady-state vowel sounds (/a/, /ae/, /e/, /U/, and /c/) from one another. A pulsed train of one vowel comprised the reference stimulus during a session. Animals were trained to press a lever and release the lever only when this reference vowel sound changed to one of the comparison vowels. All animals learned the vowel discriminations rapidly and, once learned, performed the discriminations at the 95-100% correct level. The IM administration of diazepam (0.32, 1.0, 3.2, and 10.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decrements in vowel discriminability. The diazepam-induced decrements in vowel discriminability were correlated with the degree of spectral frequency differences found among the different vowels, with lower vowel discriminability scores found for those vowels with smaller spectral differences from the reference vowel. In contrast, oral administration of delta-9-THC (0.32, 1.0, 3.2, and 5.6 mg/kg) produced no decrements in vowel discriminability.", 
    "6": "The effects of three 5HT3 receptor antagonists: BRL 43964 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, oral), GR 38032F (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, oral), and zacopride (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, IP) were examined in low light test conditions of the social interaction test. None of the three 5HT3 receptor antagonists had a significant effect on social interaction. In contrast, in two experiments chlordiazepoxide (7.5 mg/kg) significantly increased social interaction and this effect was greatest in the unfamiliar test condition. In a third experiment, the effects of GR 38032F (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, oral) and zacopride (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, oral) were investigated in the high light test conditions of the social interaction test; neither compound had a significant effect. In the elevated plus-maze, chlordiazepoxide (7.5 mg/kg oral or IP) significantly increased both the per cent number of entries made onto open arms and the per cent of time spent on the open arms, indicating an anxiolytic action. Zacopride (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, oral or IP) had no significant effect in this test. The effect of the baseline rate of responding in the social interaction test on the effects of 5-HT3 antagonists is discussed. The results from the present experiment and those from other animal tests of anxiety caution against the conclusion that 5HT3 receptor antagonists are anxiolytic.", 
    "7": "Benzodiazepine receptor occupancy in the brain following oral administration of clonazepam (CZP) with a dose of 30 micrograms/kg in six healthy young men and a further dose of 50 micrograms/kg in one of the subjects was estimated by carbon-11 labeled Ro15-1788 and positron emission tomography (PET). The effects of CZP on the latency of auditory event-related potentials (P300) were also studied. Overall brain 11C uptake was depressed and the % inhibition of 11C uptake in the gray matter of the brain at 30 min after [11C]Ro15-1788 injection was 15.3-23.5% (mean, n = 6) following 30 micrograms/kg CZP when compared with that in the control experiment without any previous treatment. The 11C uptake in the cerebral cortex in the subject who received both doses decreased in a dose-related manner after 30 micrograms/kg and 50 micrograms/kg CZP. The P300 latency was prolonged significantly by 30 micrograms/kg CZP [31.6 +/- 16.3 ms (mean +/- SD, n = 6), P less than 0.05]. The P300 latency in the same subject was prolonged in a dose-related manner by 30 micrograms/kg and 50 micrograms/kg CZP. The technique using [11C]Ro15-1788 and PET permits comparison of the pharmacological effects with the percentage of receptor sites which benzodiazepines occupy in the human brain. P300 also seems to be useful to investigate the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "8": "The involvement of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the regulation of melanotropin secretion has been investigated using perfused frog neurointermediate lobes. The GABAA agonist 3-amino-1 propane sulfonic acid mimicked the biphasic effect of GABA on alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone secretion: a brief stimulation followed by an inhibition of melanotropin secretion. The GABAA antagonist SR 95531 (10(-4) M) inhibited both stimulation and inhibition of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release induced by GABA (10(-4) M). Since the inhibitory effect of baclofen (10(-4) M) was partially antagonized by SR 95531 (10(-4) M), it appears that the GABAergic control of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release is mainly achieved through activation of GABAA receptors. GABA-induced stimulation of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release was inhibited by tetrodotoxin (10(-5) M), an Na+ -channel blocker, or nifedipine (10(-5) M), a voltage-dependent Ca2+ -channel blocker, suggesting that Na+ and Ca2+ ions are involved in the stimulatory phase of GABA action. Only central-type benzodiazepine binding site agonists such as clonazepam (10(-4) M) modified alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release. In fact, clonazepam (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) led to a dose-dependent potentiation of both GABA-induced stimulation and inhibition of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release. This potentiating effect was antagonized by the GABAA antagonist SR 95531 (10(-4) M) or by the central-type benzodiazepine binding site antagonist flumazenil (10(-4) M), whereas picrotoxin (10(-4) M) abolished only the stimulatory phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Irreversible incorporation of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro15-4513 into GABA/benzodiazepine receptor subunits was studied by UV irradiation using ligand-bound membrane pellets from rat cerebral cortical and cerebellar synaptic membranes. Specific incorporation for [3H]flunitrazepam was greater in the pellet than in the suspension. The incorporation was identical for [3H]Ro15-4513 in both pellet and suspension. With the ligand-bound pellets, 50% of the available binding sites were photolabeled by both ligands in cortex and cerebellum. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography of [3H]flunitrazepam photo-labeled receptor revealed the same number of major sites in both brain regions. In contrast, [3H]Ro15-4513 appears to label fewer sites in cortex and cerebellum. Photoaffinity labeling with [3H]flunitrazepam in ligand-bound membrane pellet provides a more selective and reliable method for studying the subunit structure of GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "10": "The peripheral benzodiazepine binding site ligand PK 11195 has been 125I-labeled by direct displacement of aromatic chlorine under solid-state conditions in 50-76% radiochemical yield and greater than 94% radiochemical purity. Purification by high pressure liquid chromatography increased the specific activity of the product from an initial 15-17 Ci/mmol to a final activity of 260-910 Ci/mmol. To determine the affinity of this [125I]PK 11195 analog for human glioma cells, saturation experiments were performed on monolayers of U251 human glioblastoma cells. Scatchard analysis of saturation data demonstrated that the [125I]PK 11195 analog binds to a single class of sites with a KD of 8.0 +/- 1.7 nM and maximal binding of 3.8 +/- 0.1 pmol/mg protein. These values are similar to those obtained when [3H]PK 11195 was assayed in U251 cells (KD = 14 +/- 3.4, Bmax = 4.1 +/- 1.3) suggesting that iodination does not appreciably alter the binding of PK 11195 to human glioma cells. In vivo autoradiographic studies of brain in C6 glioma bearing rats demonstrate selective binding of the radioligand to the tumor. These results suggest that this [125I]PK 11195 analog may be a useful radiotracer for the study of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "11": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) vary in their efficacy against generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and absence seizures, suggesting different mechanisms of action. Phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), and valproate (VPA) reduced the ability of mouse central neurons to sustain high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials (SRF) at therapeutic free serum concentrations. Phenobarbital (PB) and the benzodiazepines (BZDs), diazepam (DZP), clonazepam (CZP), and lorazepam (LZP), also reduced SRF, but only at supratherapeutic free serum concentrations achieved in treatment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus. These AEDs interact with sodium channels to slow the rate of recovery of the channels from inactivation. The BZDs and PB enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked on mouse central neurons by binding to two different sites on the GABAA receptor channel. BZDs increased the frequency of GABA receptor channel openings. In contrast, barbiturates increased the open duration of these channels. VPA enhanced brain GABA concentration and may enhance release of GABA from nerve terminals. Ethosuximide (ESM) reduced a small transient calcium current which has been shown to be involved in slow rhythmic firing of certain neurons. Reduction of SRF, enhancement of GABA-ergic inhibition, and reduction of calcium current may be, in part, the bases for AED action against generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and absence seizures, respectively.", 
    "12": "The ontogeny of diazepam's endocrine effects in male and female rats, and of 3H-diazepam binding in the hypothalami of both sexes was studied. Diazepam inhibited basal prolactin levels in 38 day-old male rats and, if prolactin levels were stimulated by Haloperidol the inhibition occurred in 28 day-old males, indicating that the hypoprolactinemic effect of the drug could be evidenced earlier if prolactin titers were high. The prolactin inhibition in females did not reach statistical significance at any studied age. Diazepam significantly released LH only in male rats at 12 days, showing thus, a period of special sensitivity of LH release to the drug. Benzodiazepine-hypothalamic binding sites increased in number from birth to puberty, reaching a plateau at 20 days of age. No sexual differences or changes in affinity were found throughout the studied period. These results suggest that the maturation of diazepam's hypoprolactinemic effect could be partially related to the increase in hypothalamic binding sites, whereas the sexual differences observed in diazepam's endocrine actions could be due to sexual differentiation of endocrine control mechanisms.", 
    "13": "Nine days following ibotenic acid induced basal forebrain lesions or a sham-operation, rats were allowed to explore an automated six-arm radial tunnel maze. From each session, several measures of locomotor and exploratory activity were registered. Lesioned and sham-operated animals were treated with either the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist beta-carboline ZK 93 426 (5 mg/kg; IP) or vehicle (Cremofor EL 10% in saline; IP; n = 10 for each group). Treatment was carried out 30 min before each session during acquisition (seven sessions) and reversals of the maze configuration (seven sessions). Eight days following the 14th session, the animals were retested without any further drug treatment. The main results suggest that the lesion resulted in locomotor hyperactivity, an increase in the number of blind arm entries, and of choice stereotypy. Treatment with ZK 93 426 attenuated the lesion-induced alterations of locomotor and exploratory activities. During the retest, the lesioned, previously vehicle-treated rats revisited arms which they had already explored during this session more frequently than the lesioned, previously ZK-treated rats; the latter group did not differ from the sham-lesioned controls. It is concluded that basal forebrain lesioned animals explored the tunnel maze less efficiently than sham-lesioned controls and that the lesioned animals benefited from the treatment with ZK 93 426. Although the specificity of the lesion in terms of destruction of cholinergic neurons remains unsettled, and although the psychological significances of the behavioral measures obtained from the tunnel maze are not yet fully understood, these results suggest that antagonists or partial inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor may be able to normalize basal forebrain lesion-induced behavioral alterations.", 
    "14": "The effects of chronic caffeine administration on both adenosine and benzodiazepine receptors were studied in mouse brain membranes. Animals were fed on a diet enriched with caffeine (600 mg/kg diet) for 15 days and sacrificed 2, 4, 8 and 15 days after withdrawal. Compared with controls fed on a regular diet, animals receiving a caffeine-enriched diet showed an increase in the number of brain adenosine receptors labeled with [3H]-DPX in both the cerebellum and forebrain regions. This up-regulation was still significant 15 days after withdrawal in the cerebellum but not in the forebrain, where the number of adenosine receptors returned to control levels within 8 days following withdrawal. Benzodiazepine receptors labeled by [3H]-B-CCE were not influenced by chronic caffeine diet or withdrawal.", 
    "15": "We have reported previously an increase in the number of beta-adrenoceptors in mouse cerebral cortex 7 days after kindling of seizures by repeated once-daily administration of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, FG7142. In subsequent experiments, an even larger increase in beta-adrenoceptor number was found 7 days after a single injection of this compound. The present experiments investigated whether FG7142-induced changes in adrenoceptor binding are also found in the rat and whether the effects of a single and repeated injections of this drug differ quantitatively. In view of the anxiogenic effects of FG7142, we have also tested for parallel changes in behaviours associated with anxiety and exploration. Nine days after a single injection of FG7142, the number of beta-adrenoceptors in the cerebral cortex was greater than that found after repeated administration of this compound; this difference was statistically significant. There was no difference in beta-adrenoceptor binding to tissues from chronically FG7142-treated and vehicle-injected animals and there were no changes in alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding or noradrenaline levels after either a single or repeated FG7142 treatment. Neither single nor repeated FG7142 treatment modified spontaneous behaviour in either the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety or the holeboard test of exploration. The behavioural effects of yohimbine and clenbuterol in these tests were also unaffected by FG7142. We discuss the possibility that the difference in the effects of a single and repeated administration of FG7142 on beta-adrenoceptor binding is related to the expression of kindled seizures.", 
    "16": "The effect of hypophysectomy and hormonal replacement on the density of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) in rat adrenal gland and kidney was studied. In the adrenal gland, hypophysectomy caused a significant decrease of 3-fold in PBS density. In the kidney, in contrast, hypophysectomy did not affect PBS density. In the adrenal gland, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administered to hypophysectomized rats caused a significant increase of more than 5-fold in PBS density compared to untreated hypophysectomized rats, and of more than 1.6-fold compared to intact rats. In contrast, the hormones pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and hydrocortisone (HC), administered to hypophysectomized rats, failed to restore PBS density in the adrenal gland. In the kidney, HC administered to hypophysectomized rats caused an increase of 1.4-fold in PBS density compared to untreated hypophysectomized and intact rats. In contrast, the hormones ACTH, PMSG, and DES, administered to hypophysectomized rats, did not affect PBS density in the kidney. None of the hormones tested altered the equilibrium dissociation constant of PBS in either the adrenal gland or the kidney. These findings indicate that PBS density in rat adrenal gland and kidney is hormonally modulated.", 
    "17": "The laminar distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, including the M1-receptor subtype, of beta-adrenergic receptors, and noradrenaline uptake sites, was studied in the adult rat visual, frontal, somatosensory and motor cortex, using quantitative receptor autoradiography. In the visual cortex, the highest density of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was found in layer I. From layer II/III to layer V binding decreases continuously reaching a constant binding level in layers V and VI. This laminar pattern of muscarinic receptor density differs somewhat from that observed in the non-visual cortical regions examined: layer II/III contained the highest receptor density followed by layer I and IV: lowest density was found in layer V and VI. The binding profile of the muscarinic cholinergic M1-subtype through the visual cortex shows a peak in cortical layer II and in the upper part of layer VI, whereas in the non-visual cortical regions cited the binding level was high in layer II/III, moderate in layer I and IV, and low in layer VI. Layers I to IV of the visual cortex contained the highest beta-adrenergic receptor densities, whereas only low binding levels were observed in the deeper layers. A similar laminar distribution was found also in the frontal, somatosensory and motor cortex. The density of noradrenaline uptake sites was high in all layers of the cortical regions studied, but with noradrenaline uptake sites somewhat more concentrated in the superficial layers than in deeper ones. The distinct laminar pattern of cholinergic and noradrenergic receptor sites indicates a different role for acetylcholine and noradrenaline in the functional anatomy of the cerebral cortex, and in particular, the visual cortex.",

The tissue possesses two distinct enzymes: a \"low\" Km PDE (Km = 0.42 x 10(-6) M; Vmax = 16 pmol/mg protein/min) and a \"high\" Km PDE (Km = 180 x 10(-6) M; Vmax = 2853 pmol/mg prot/min). Only the \"high\" Km form is stimulated by calcium. 3. Diazepam (1-0.5 mM) significantly inhibits both enzymes, the inhibition being of competitive type.", 
    "19": "The levels of gamma amino butyric acid (GABAA) receptors (i.e. 3H-Muscimol binding sites) were determined by quantitative neurotransmitter receptors autoradiography in ovariectomized (OVX), OVX-estradiolo (E), OVX-progesterone (P), OVX-E + P, diazepam (DZ) and DZ + Ro15-1788 treated female hamsters. The various hormonal treatments altered 3H muscimol binding in many brain areas, whereas DZ and DZ + Ro15-1788 had little influence on GABAA receptor levels at the onset of the blocked aggressive behavioral activity. For example, E, P and E + P all significantly increased 3H muscimol binding in medial preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, and vertical diagonal bandmedial septal nucleus, whereas P treatment increased binding in the caudate-putamen and decreased it in reuniens nucleus of the thalamus. E and E + P treatments increased 3H muscimol binding in the corticomedial amygdala nucleus and hippocampus. Diazepam treatment decreased the GABAA receptor binding in the caudate-putamen and basolateral amygdala, while having no effect in the other brain regions where hormone treatment was effective. In vitro incubation of brain sections with micromolar concentrations of E or P did not change muscimol binding. These results suggest that ovarian steroids, and benzodiazepines to a lesser extent, modulate 3H muscimol binding but do so in different brain regions. The hormone effects on 3H muscimol binding in the critical reproductive centres at a time period that coincides with the onset of its behavioral effect is consistent with a genomic controlled activity.", 
    "20": "Some 3-aryl-6-hydroxymethyl-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazines (VI a,b) and 3-aryl-6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazines (XVIII) have been synthesized. From (VI b) some 3-aryl-6-(alkylamino)methyl- and 3-aryl-6-(alkoxy)methyl-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazines have been prepared and evaluated in vitro for their ability to inhibit selective 3H-diazepam (3H-DZ) binding to benzodiazepine-receptors (BZRs) from homogenates of synaptosomes from rat brains. Several compounds have been shown to displace 3H-DZ from BZRs with Ki (nM) values ranging from 2.2 to 88, comparable to those of the reference drugs including Diazepam.", 
    "21": "Some disubstituted triazinophthalazines and traizinophthalazinones were synthesized and tested in vitro for inhibition of the 3H-diazepam (3H-DZ) specific binding to benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) in membranes from synaptosomes of rat brain and in vivo for their effects on the conditioned behaviour (rat). These compounds showed Ki values (nM) in the in vitro test ranging from 220 to more than 3000 and some of them had approximate ED50S of 30 mg/kg, i.p. (rat) in the conditioned avoidance behaviour test (CR2).", 
    "22": "Some 2-aminoalkyl-8-chloro- and 2-aryl-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]-phthalazine-3-(2H)-ones were synthesized and preliminarily tested in vitro and in vivo as potential benzodiazepine-receptor (BZRs) ligands. 2-Aryl-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]-phthalazine-3(2H)-ones displaced in vitro 3H-diazepam (3H-DZ) from rat brain specific binding sites with Ki (nM) comparable to DZ and chlordiazepoxide used as reference compounds. The specific binding of the triazolones of this study was not enhanced in vitro by 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and in vivo they did not show any activity in counteracting the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced convulsions (mice). One of these compounds (IV a) antagonized the effects of DZ in the bicuculline (BIC) induced convulsions test (mice) and the DZ induced muscle relaxant effects in the horizontal wire test.", 
    "23": "The present study investigates the inhibitory effect of the novel potent benzodiazepine-related CCK-antagonist L-364,718 on pancreatic growth in the rat induced by chronic administration of caerulein and bombesin-like peptides. Caerulein, injected s.c. twice daily at a dose of 1 microgram/kg body weight, and bombesin (10 micrograms/kg) induced a similar increase (1.5-3-fold) in pancreatic wet weight, total protein, amylase, trypsin, putrescine and spermidine content after 14 days of treatment. Growth induced by caerulein showed a significant increase in total DNA content suggesting cellular hyperplasia, whereas bombesin-like peptides led to cellular hypertrophy. In comparison to bombesin the decapeptide neuromedin C (10 micrograms/kg) was found to be 30-50% less potent. In the same dose range, neuromedin B and the tachykinins neurokinin A and B, all structurally related to bombesin, had no significant trophic effect on the rat pancreas. Administration of the CCK-antagonist L-364,718 twice daily at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg or at 1.0 mg/kg, either s.c. or orally, led dose-dependently to a near-complete inhibition of the caerulein-induced trophic effect. In contrast, L-364,718 administered at identical dosages, did not affect pancreatic hypertrophy induced by bombesin and neuromedin C. It is concluded that both peptides mediate their effect on the rat pancreas directly and not via release of endogenous cholecystokinin. Tachykinins are not involved in the regulation of pancreatic growth. Caerulein- and bombesin-like peptides have comparable effects on the stimulation of protein and polyamine synthesis.", 
    "24": "The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism by which caffeine increases anxiety. Rats were tested in the social interaction test of anxiety after administration of caffeine (20 or 40 mg/kg) alone or in combination with various compounds. In order to investigate the role of adenosine receptors, caffeine was given in combination with 2-chloroadenosine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). To investigate the role of benzodiazepine receptors, chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (RO 15-1788, 1 and 10 mg/kg) and a triazolobenzodiazepine U-43,465 (32 mg/kg) were used. Finally, an alpha 2-receptor agonist, clonidine (0.1 and 0.025 mg/kg) and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, DL-propranolol (5 mg/kg), were used to study the role of noradrenergic systems in the effects of caffeine. Caffeine (20 and 40 mg/kg) reduced the time spent in social interaction and this effect was antagonized by chlordiazepoxide, U-43,465 and DL-propranolol, but not by flumazenil, 2-chloroadenosine or clonidine. It was therefore concluded that the anxiogenic effect of caffeine was unlikely to be due to its effects at adenosine or benzodiazepine receptors. It is suggested that the reversal of caffeine's effects by chordiazepoxide may have been \"functional,\" i.e., merely a cancellation of two opposite effects. It is discussed whether the reversal of caffeine's effects by propranolol and U-43,465 are functional, or reflect a noradrenergic site of action.", 
    "25": "RO15-4513, an imidazobenzodiazepine that has been reported to antagonize several behavioral and biochemical actions of ethanol, was given to C3H mice at various times during withdrawal from chronic (72 hours) continuous exposure to ethanol vapor. When administered immediately following chronic ethanol exposure, RO15-4513 (6 or 12 mg/kg) did not influence the withdrawal response. However, when given at subsequent times (3, 5, and 8 hours postethanol withdrawal), RO15-4513 significantly increased the severity of the withdrawal response in ethanol-exposed mice. Moreover, this exacerbation was completely reversed by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO15-1788. Thus, these data indicate that the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, RO15-4513, is capable of exacerbating, but not precipitating, ethanol withdrawal.", 
    "26": "Comparative study of [3H]-flunitrazepam binding to brain cortex benzodiazepine receptors was performed in rats with different preference to ethanol divided into following groups: 1, rejecting 15% ethanol which was not accessible for 3 months; 2, preferring 15% ethanol freely accessible for 3 months; 3, preferring alcohol and having free access to it except for the last 24 h before decapitation; 4, preferring ethanol not accessible for 3 months. Considerable fall in benzodiazepine receptor affinity was detected in Group 4 as compared to Group 1 (alpha = 0.012; p less than 0.01). The corresponding numbers of [3H]-flunitrazepam binding sites were not different. The data were nonuniform in Groups 2 and 3. Comparison between the two populations substantially different in preferring (Groups 2, 3, 4) and rejecting (Group 1) ethanol reflects the general trend of reduction on the benzodiazepine receptors affinity in preferring rats. This can be a part of biological basis for shaping the craving for alcohol.", 
    "27": "The radioligand-receptor method was used to assay the M-cholinereceptors and opioid binding centers in biopsy specimens of the duodenal mucosa from 40 patients with duodenal ulcer as compared with the results of subsequent therapy by means of gastrocepin (20 patients) and dalargin (20 patients). Analysis of the isothermal curve of 3H-QNB-binding with duodenal mucosa membranes within Skatchard's coordinates showed the presence of 2 subtypes of muscarinic receptors blocked (M1) and not blocked (M2) by gastrocepin. The majority of the patients in both groups demonstrated a significant decrease of the dissociation constant as compared to the control (20 patients). In patients with high receptor sensitivity to gastrocepin and dalargin, ulcer cicatrization was noted during the treatment in all the cases. Meanwhile the treatment proved little effective in patients with appreciably decreased receptor sensitivity to the drugs under consideration. The data obtained indicate the possibility of predicting the results of duodenal ulcer treatment by means of the radioreceptor analysis, providing the basis for the individualized treatment choice.", 
    "28": "Pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that benzodiazepines can modulate the ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) associated with social separation of rat pups. In this study, in vivo receptor autoradiography was used to determine if brain benzodiazepine receptors were functionally less available to bind an exogenous ligand during social separation. The labelled benzodiazepine receptor antagonist 3H-RO 15-1788 was given to 10-day-old rat pups during 25 minutes of social separation. In autoradiographic studies of brains from separated pups, the binding of 3H-RO 15-1788 was decreased in neocortex (frontal, motor, and somatosensory), hippocampus, and superior and inferior colliculi. As these same regions showed no alteration of in vitro binding of 3H-RO 15-1788, these in vivo binding decreases do not reflect changes in receptor number. The interpretation of decreased in vivo binding and implications of these results for defining the neural substrates of separation behavior are discussed.", 
    "29": "Thiamine deficiency (Wernicke-Korsakoff's disease) may not be the only mechanism whereby chronic alcohol abuse affects the brain and not all alcohol-related changes may be evident morphologically. The purpose of this study was to determine if alcohol abuse affects muscarinic cholinergic and benzodiazepine receptors in the hippocampus of histologically normal brains obtained at autopsy in a general hospital population. Because patients were excluded who had significant brain atrophy and/or dementia severe enough to require institutionalization, the reported findings are presumed to be early changes in the development of an alcohol encephalopathy. In addition, patients were excluded from this study if they had clinical brain diseases (including Wernicke's disease), died in coma, had liver disease, or received medications that could potentially alter receptor binding. The reported changes in receptor binding were therefore presumed to be related to alcohol abuse per se and not an alcohol-associated condition. We found that muscarinic cholinergic synaptic receptor density determined with 3[H] quinuclidinyl benzilate was decreased by 30% in homogenates of the hippocampus of 25 alcohol abusers compared with 25 matched nonalcoholic controls. Similarly, densities of benzodiazepine receptors determined with 3[H] flunitrazepam were also decreased by approximately 30% in alcohol abusers. The affinities of both receptor types were not affected by alcohol abuse. Age and death-autopsy time interval had no significant effects on either wet tissue protein concentrations, yields of protein after centrifugation, or receptor binding. The contributions of age and time interval were each less than 2% of the total variance of protein concentrations and receptor binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "Rat brain membranes were treated with different protein modifying reagents, all of which were able to reduce [3H]tryptamine binding. However, inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide only was counteracted by coincubation with tryptamine. Thus, the [3H]tryptamine binding molecule is a membrane protein with an essential sulfhydryl group at the binding site. After incubation of digitonin-solubilized membranes with seven different lectins, no precipitation of [3H]tryptamine binding sites was observed. On concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography, no [3H]tryptamine binding activity was found to be specifically bound. Therefore, the [3H]tryptamine binding protein appears to be devoid of lectin binding carbohydrate residues.", 
    "31": "The number of head-dips, the time spent head-dipping, the number of rears and the locomotor activity of mice placed in a holeboard was reduced by lorazepam (0.25 mg/kg) 1 and 1.5 h after oral administration and these reductions were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (1 mg/kg). Activity returned to control levels at 3 and 4.5 h for head-dipping, and between 3 and 12 h for rearing and locomotor activity. However, significant late-appearing reductions were found for the number of head-dips and the time spent head-dipping (6 h) and rearing and locomotor activity (15 h) and these decreases could not be reversed by flumazenil. Similar results were found after oral administration of oxazepam (7 mg/kg). Oxazepam reduced the number of head-dips and time spent head-dipping at 1, 1.5 and 3 h and these reductions were reversed by flumazenil (1 mg/kg). Head-dipping activity returned to normal at 4.5 h. Significant reductions were also found for both measures at 1, 6 and 7.5 h and these late reductions could not be reversed by flumazenil. This suggests that the late-appearing reductions in holeboard behaviours, resulting from lorazepam or oxazepam administration to mice, is not mediated by the benzodiazepine receptor. This conclusion was supported by the results from in vivo binding, which showed no change in the % receptor occupancy 3-15 h after administration of lorazepam or oxazepam. In contrast to the holeboard behaviours, the anticonvulsant effects of the two drugs showed good correlations with receptor occupancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The interaction between GABAergic (barbiturates, diazepam, ethanol) and other (phenytoin) anticonvulsants and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK 801 in protecting rats against maximal electroshock (MES)- and picrotoxin-induced (10 mg/kg) convulsions was studied. MK 801 (0.1 to 5 mg/kg) showed anticonvulsant responses against MES-induced convulsions in a dose dependent manner, higher doses showing severe muscle relaxation, motor incoordination, and anticonvulsant action. It also produced stereotypic head movement, circling behavior, and affected locomotion. When subanticonvulsant dose (1 mg/kg) of MK 801 was simultaneously administered with subprotective doses of GABAergic anticonvulsants, it significantly potentiated the effects of barbiturates, as compared to other agents. At 1 mg/kg, MK 801 did not offer protection against tonic convulsions though protected (100%) the animals from mortality due to picrotoxin-induced convulsions. It potentiated the effect of a subprotective dose (5 mg/kg) of pentobarbital, but not of diazepam, against tonic convulsions. However, no mortality was observed in either group. The antiglutamate action of barbiturates, particularly that of pentobarbital, may contribute to the observed potentiating response between pentobarbital and MK 801.", 
    "33": "The effects of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline on the anticonflict effect observed after depletion of brain serotonin (5-HT), were examined in a modified Vogel's punished drinking conflict model. Pretreatment with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 300 mg/kg/day for three days, last injection - 24 h) markedly decreased brain 5-HT levels and produced clearcut anticonflict effects. The anticonflict effect, but not the biochemical effect, of PCPA pretreatment was completely counteracted by both flumazenil (10 mg/kg, - 30 min) and bicuculline (2.0 mg/kg, - 10 min), in doses not altering the behavior per se. The findings suggest a behavioral interaction between 5-HT systems and the GABAA/BDZ chloride ionophore receptor complex, possibly involving a direct neuronal interaction, neuromodulation or hormonal alterations.", 
    "34": "Thieno-triazolo-1,4-diazepines (hetrazepines) antagonize platelet-activating factor (PAF) induced platelet aggregation and inhibit the binding of [3H]-PAF. Introduction of a carboxamide alkyl side chain into the thiophene ring leads to compounds with less affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor and without sedative effects on the central nervous system (e.g., WEB 2086). By ring closure of the side chain, new tetracyclic compounds have been obtained. A parabolic relationship between either [3H]-PAF binding or PAF activity and the bulkiness of the alkyl substituents to the triazolo ring of the hetrazepines or of the bulkiness the 2-acyl moiety of the PAF analogues was found in quantitative structure-activity relationships. This suggests that perhaps the alkyl substituent of the hetrazepines fits the same receptor pocket as the 2-acyl moiety of the PAF agonists.",

Particular attention is given to the interactions of kynurenines with the excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, their receptors, benzodiazepine receptor complex, catecholamines, serotonin, acetylcholine. The following trends of studies on the neuroactivity of kynurenines seem to be promising: isolation of specific binding sites for the most active kynurenines--kynurenine, quinolinic and kynurenic acids, the interaction with other endogenous convulsants like beta-carbolines, endorphines, folates, etc., the search of the brain structures triggering or deferring the excitatory and convulsant effects of kynurenines.",

The hyperglycaemic effect of clonazepam (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was dose-dependently reduced by Ro 15-1788 (10-40 mg/kg, i.v.), a benzodiazepine antagonist. 4. Ro 5-3663, a GABA antagonist which may act at the picrotoxinin site, produced a significant increase in blood glucose (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.); however, when given together with clonazepam (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuation of the hyperglycaemic effect was observed. 5. Pk 8165, a partial agonist, lacked an effect on blood glucose over the dose range of 5-20 mg/kg, i.p. but caused a slight increase in blood glucose in a dose of 40 mg/kg, i.p.", 
    "37": "Pyrethroid insecticides interact with a variety of neurochemical processes, but not all of these actions are likely to be involved in the disruption of nerve function. Several lines of evidence suggest that the voltage-sensitive sodium channel is the single principal molecular target site for all pyrethroids and DDT analogs in both insects and mammals. The alterations of sodium channel functions identified in both biophysical and biochemical studies are directly related to the effects of these compounds on intact nerves. The pyrethroid recognition site of the sodium channel exhibits the stringent stereospecificity predicted by in vivo estimates of intrinsic neurotoxicity in both insects and mammals. Type I and Type II compounds produce qualitatively different effects on sodium channel tail currents, divergent actions on intact nerves, and different effects on the excitability of vertebrate skeletal muscle. Moreover, compounds that are defined as intermediate in the Type I/Type II classification scheme are also intermediate in their effects on sodium channel kinetics. The range of different actions on sensory and motor nerve pathways arising from these qualitatively different effects at the level of the sodium channel appear to be sufficient to explain the distinct poisoning syndromes that have been identified in both insects and mammals. Thus, it does not appear necessary to invoke different primary target sites for Type I and Type II compounds to explain their actions in whole animals. Although the voltage-sensitive sodium channel is likely to be the principal site of pyrethroid action, it is probably not the only site involved in intoxication. Insect neurosecretory neurons are sensitive to very low concentrations of pyrethroids, and disruption of the neuroendocrine system has been implicated as a factor contributing to the irreversible effects of pyrethroid intoxication in insects. Since action potentials in these nerves are carried by calcium ions through TTX-insensitive voltage-gated cation channels, these findings provide evidence that pyrethroids can alter neuronal excitability through an action on voltage-sensitive channels other than the sodium channel. Actions on voltage-sensitive calcium channels may also be involved in the effects of pyrethroids on neurotransmitter release in mammals. The proconvulsant actions of pyrethroids mediated through the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor may also contribute to pyrethroid intoxication. Both Type I and Type II compounds are potent proconvulsants in vivo at doses well below those required to produce pyrethroid-dependent intoxication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Ethanol (ETH) and general anesthetics have been reported to facilitate the chloride channel opening, possibly, or at least partly, through an interaction with the GABA-benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor-gated chloride ionophore \"supramolecular complex\". Recently Ro 15-4513, a novel BZ ligand, has been indicated as a potent and selective antagonist of various ETH-induced behavioral and biochemical effects. However, since its precise characterization is still a matter of debate, we have tested and compared the effect of Ro 15-4513, as well as its antagonism against ETH, in two objective electrophysiological parameters, i.e., the electroencephalograph (EEG) pattern in freely moving rats and single unit activity of reticulata neurons. Ro 15-4513 produced an EEG state of alertness and antagonized the behavioral impairment and the EEG deterioration by ETH. However, while its protective action was consistent against moderate doses (2 g/kg) of ETH, it was much less evident versus higher doses (4 and 8 g/kg). On reticulata cells, Ro 15-4513 potently stimulated their spontaneous firing and reversed the depression by both ETH and Na-pentobarbital. Moreover, the beta-carboline DMCM also had similar effects. The \"pure\" BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788 was completely inefective against ETH, yet fully cancelled the reversing actions of Ro 15-4513 and DMCM upon ETH or Na-pentobarbital effects. It is concluded that Ro 15-4513 behaves as a BZ inverse agonist, so that its opposition to ETH and Na-pentobarbital is probably the result of its \"negative\" coupling with the BZ recognition site that triggers the closing of chloride channels. It suggests that BZ inverse agonists might constitute, in the near future, a new class of analeptic drugs.", 
    "39": "Sodium phenobarbitone was tested for its ability to antagonise the anxiogenic effects of compounds acting at three different central sites. These compounds were: FG 7142, a beta-carboline which acts at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex; pentylenetetrazole, which acts at the picrotoxinin site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex; and yohimbine which is an antagonist at the alpha 2-adrenoceptor. The experiments were carried out in two tests of anxiety using rats. In the social interaction test (the test arena was familiar and dimly lit), FG 7142 (5 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazole (15 mg/kg) reduced the time spent in social interaction (indicating anxiogenic activity); these effects were reversed by sodium phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg). Sodium phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg) alone decreased locomotor activity as measured in the social interaction test, which was reversed by pentylenetetrazole (15 mg/kg). In the elevated plus-maze, FG 7142 (6.7 mg/kg) pentylenetetrazole (20 mg/kg) and yohimbine (4 mg/kg) reduced the percentage of open-arm entries and the percentage of time spent on the open arms (indicating anxiogenic activity); these effects were reversed by sodium phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg). Sodium phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg) alone significantly increased the percentage of open-arm entries and the percentage of time spent on the open arms (indicating anxiolytic activity). This study, together with previous studies using other clinically-effective anxiolytic drugs, suggests that the ability of a compound to antagonise the effects of anxiogenic agents may be a useful indirect means of predicting anxiolytic activity.", 
    "40": "The in vivo and in vitro modulation of central benzodiazepine binding sites (BDZ-R) by phosphatidylserine purified from bovine cerebral cortex (BC-PS) was studied. Five days i.p. administration of 15 mg/kg/day of BC-PS liposomes increased the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) for [3H]flunitrazepam in cerebral cortical membranes. In contrast, the density of hippocampal benzodiazepine recognition binding sites decreased. In cerebellar membranes, BC-PS treatment did not alter the characteristics of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Similar experiments using phosphatidylcholine extracted from bovine brain (BC-PC) resulted in no changes in the [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the 3 neural structures studied. Confirming previous results, rats submitted to an acute swimming stress showed a decrease in the density of cerebral cortex BDZ-R. Animals treated with BC-PS liposomes before stress showed cortical [3H]flunitrazepam binding significantly below treated, unstressed animals but not below controls. The effects of BC-PS liposomes appeared to be selective for the central type of BDZ-R since no changes were observed in [3H]RO 5-4864 binding, a radioligand specific for the peripheral type BDZ-R. Preincubation of cerebral cortical and cerebellar synaptosomal membranes with BC-PS liposomes (1-300 micrograms per assay) significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner (up to 100 micrograms) the [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Scatchard analysis revealed changes in the apparent affinity without alterations in the Bmax. Very similar results were obtained using a purified PS from spinal cord. BC-PC, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid and the lyso derivatives of PS and PC (lysoPS and lysoPC) were found to be ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Treatment of pregnant Long Evans rats with a low dose of diazepam (1.25 mg/kg per day s.c.) from gestational day (GD) 14 to 20 resulted in severe and long lasting depression of cellular immune responses in male and female offspring. T lymphocyte proliferation, induced by allogeneic stimulation in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) or geneic stimulation in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) or mitogenic stimulation (concanavalin A), decreased by 50 % or more over a postnatal period of about 2 months. Treatment of the pregnant dam during the early fetal period, from GD 12 to GD 16, did not significantly affect these immune parameters, whereas treatment during later gestation, from GD 16 to 20, significantly affected T lymphocyte function. Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine with high affinity for the central type benzodiazepine site, also affected cellular immune response in offspring. Our data indicate that benzodiazepine treatment during the fetal period may result in persistent postnatal deficiency of cellular immune responses. The relative role of central and peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor and possible interactions with maternal and fetal pituitary - adrenocortical systems are discussed.", 
    "42": "Adult male Fisher 344 rats (8-10 wk old) were dosed ip with 1.75 mg/kg body weight of triethyllead chloride (TEL) for 5 consecutive days. Rats were sacrificed 1, 7, or 21 d after the last injection. The rate of lipid peroxidation was significantly elevated in frontal cortex at all three time points assayed (1, 7, or 21 d). However, hippocampal and cerebellar membranes showed no changes in peroxidative capacity at these time points. In order to determine whether cortical membrane damage was reflected in alteration of a restricted protein population, a series of high-affinity receptor binding sites was determined in cortical membranes derived from treated rats 7 d after the last injection of triethyllead. The rate of lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in the frontal cortex of triethyllead treated rats; however, no changes in the binding of [3H]spiroperidol, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, and [3H]benzodiazepine were seen in animals exposed to triethyllead. The cortical wet weight, protein content, and cell number were also unchanged by TEL treatment, reflecting an absence of gross damage.", 
    "43": "The subcellular distribution, allosteric coupling, and topology of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor were investigated in situ. We have shown previously that a transmembrane fragment (Mr = 24,000) of the benzodiazepine receptor remains in the plasma membrane after trypsin treatment of embryonic brain neurons maintained in primary monolayer cell culture. Here we report a study of the effects of exhaustive trypsinization on the binding of ligands to the GABA recognition site. Approximately 60% of the binding sites for [3H]muscimol in intact cells are inactivated by extracellular trypsin and, therefore, are associated with cell surface GABA receptors, whereas 40% of the sites are trypsin resistant. GABA potentiates [3H]flunitrazepam binding to intact cells and trypsin-treated intact cells. GABA-induced enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to intact cells is eliminated when cell-surface benzodiazepine receptors are blocked with Ro7-0213 (a charged benzodiazepine), but some enhancement remains after extracellular trypsinization. This provides indirect evidence for the existence of a population of trypsin-resistant GABA recognition sites associated with cell-surface receptors and indicates that trypsin-resistant cell-surface GABA recognition sites are allosterically linked to trypsin-resistant cell-surface benzodiazepine recognition sites, which we have shown previously to be associated with the trypsin-generated Mr 24,000 transmembrane fragment. The results are discussed in terms of a model of the transmembrane topology of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "44": "In dissociated cellular preparations of adult rat cortex, M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors were shown to mediate phosphoinositide metabolism and cAMP inhibition, respectively. Additionally, in dissociated striatum, an M2 receptor was shown to inhibit the level of cAMP. The components of \"receptor reserve\" in these three receptor-effector systems were evaluated by the method of partial receptor inactivation and the dissociation constants for the full agonist carbachol were determined. In dissociated cellular preparations of cortex, and in the presence of 10 mM lithium ion, carbachol (EC50 = 116 microM) activated an M1 receptor subtype (atropine Ki = 0.9 nM; pirenzepine Ki = 9.3 nM) to elicit up to a 7-fold release over the basal level of [3H]inositol 1-phosphate. Carbachol was 100-fold more potent (EC50 approximately 1 microM) in the inhibition of forskolin-elevated [3H]cAMP levels in both the cortex (maximally 28%) and striatum (maximally 49%). Pirenzepine blocked the [3H]cAMP inhibition responses to carbachol in cortex and striatum with Ki values of 334 nM and 313 nM, respectively, which indicated that cortical and striatal M2 receptors mediate [3H]cAMP inhibition. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the full agonist carbachol in mediating these two biochemical responses were determined after partial receptor inactivation with propylbenzilylcholine mustard. The results indicate that cortical M1 receptor-mediated phosphoinositide metabolism is elicited by carbachol through a low affinity agonist-receptor complex (carbachol Kd = 90 microM). However, the cortical and striatal M2 receptor-mediated inhibition of [3H]cAMP is mediated by a high affinity agonist-receptor complex (carbachol Kd = 8.5 microM and 2.9 microM, respectively). Thus, the agonist is bound in a low affinity active conformation of the M1 receptor but the agonist is bound in a high affinity active conformation of the M2 receptor. In contrast to the cortical M1-phosphoinositide system, the central M2 receptors exhibited a significant receptor reserve in their mediation of [3H]cAMP inhibition, as elicited by the full agonist carbachol. Whereas the ratio of Kd/EC50 for carbachol was 0.9 at the cortical M1 receptor, this ratio was 9.4 and 3.2 at the cortical M2 and striatal M2 receptors, respectively.", 
    "45": "We have evaluated the affinity and density of binding sites for [3H]Ro5-4864 and [3H]PK11195 in intact and fragmented rat kidney mitochondria. These sites are known as peripheral-type or mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBR) and the preceding paper provided evidence that they function in vitro as modulators of mitochondrial respiratory control (1). In this report, MBR density, localization, and ligand specificity were investigated. In intact mitochondria, there were approximately the same number of binding sites for [3H]PK11195 as for [3H]Ro5-4864, and their apparent Kd values were identical. However, in mitochondrial fragments, there were 80% more binding sites for [3H]Ro5-4864 than for [3H]PK01195. Rat kidney mitochondria were fractionated by decompression and digitonin-based methods into outer and inner membrane-containing fractions before and after incorporation of the MBR-specific photoaffinity ligand [3H]PK14105. Assays of selective mitochondrial membrane markers and [3H]Ro5-4864 binding or specifically bound [3H]PK14105 revealed that the receptors were found in the mitochondrial outer membrane. We also evaluated the binding of a large number of structurally and pharmacologically diverse compounds to MBR by studying their ability to inhibit the binding of both 3H-ligands. These compounds had affinities ranging from 0.015 to 100 microM and, with a few exceptions, were similar in their abilities to bind to MBR in intact and fragmented mitochondria. However, there was considerable variation in the ratios between drug potencies at displacing [3H]Ro5-4864 and [3H]PK11195. This represents a new form of evidence that these two radioligands do not label identical sites on the receptor. Thirteen of the drugs, including [3H]Ro5-4864 and [3H]PK11195, were analyzed as to the nature of the inhibition and, with only two exceptions, were competitive inhibitors. One drug, Konig's polyanion, was uncompetitive whereas the other, cyclosporin A, was a noncompetitive inhibitor. These studies revealed several new classes of MBR ligands and suggest that the relationship between ligand structure and binding affinity is highly complex.", 
    "46": "The effects of Ro 5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam; the archetypic peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand) were examined on the electrophysiological responses of rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons maintained in vitro. Ro 5-4864 produced a biphasic response (consisting of an increase followed by a decrease in spontaneous firing) in approximately 50% of the neurons studied. The remaining neurons responded to Ro 5-4864 application with decreased spontaneous activity. The EC50 and IC50 values for the excitatory and depressant responses to Ro 5-4864 were 490 and 450 nM, respectively. Preincubation with PK 11195 [N-methyl-N-(methyl-1-propyl)chloro-2-phenyl-1-isoquinoline-3-carboxamid e; a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist] reduced the potency of Ro 5-4864 to inhibit cell firing in a competitive fashion, but did not alter Ro 5-4864-elicited excitations. A similar effect was observed with the monocarboxylic acid anion transport inhibitor UK 5099 [alpha-cyano-beta-(1-phenylindol-3-yl)acrylate]. In contrast, the increases in cell firing elicited by t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (a GABA-gated chloride channel blocker) were enhanced 6-fold by coperfusion with both Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195. These findings suggest that the Ro 5-4864 induced depressions of Purkinje neuron spontaneous activity is mediated by peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, whereas the excitation may result from modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride ionophore.", 
    "47": "Several lines of evidence suggest that dietary choline intake influences the metabolism of membrane phospholipids with possible effects on GABAergic neurotransmission. Based on these findings, the present experiments determined whether chronic choline supplementation or deficiency alters GABAergic function at the level of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine-chloride channel complex. To accomplish this, mice were fed diets containing 0% (deficient), 0.2% (basal) or 2.0% (supplemented) choline chloride for 28 days, and behavior, ligand binding at several sites in the complex and chloride uptake were determined in various brain regions. For both rotarod ataxia and open-field activity, mice receiving choline supplementation had a decreased response to clonazepam compared to those receiving basal and deficient diets. Choline supplementation significantly increased the in vivo binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 to cortex and cerebellum by 19% and 24%, respectively, and in vitro studies in cortical membranes indicated a significant 36% increase in the maximal number of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites without a change in affinity, as compared to basal controls. In contrast, [3H]Ro15-1788 binding in vivo in all brain regions from mice fed the deficient diet decreased significantly to 20 to 58% of control values. Dietary choline intake did not alter GABA levels in brain, the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the chloride channel or the coupling between GABA and either the t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate site or the benzodiazepine site. However, the function of the GABAA receptor, determined by muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake into cortical synaptoneurosomes, was increased significantly in tissue from the supplemented group as compared to both control and deficient groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "The present study was designed to investigate whether D,L-laudanosine (a breakdown product of the neuromuscular relaxant atracurium besylate) interacts with benzodiazepinergic receptors or muscarinic receptors, both of which are involved in epilepsy and other types of seizures. The ability of D,L-laudanosine (10(-10) to 5 X 10(-5) M) to displace ligands specific for these receptors from their binding sites was tested. D,L-Laudanosine failed to inhibit the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to central benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex, the binding of [3H]PK 11195 to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the cerebral cortex and kidney, the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the kidney, or the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex. These results suggest that laudanosine does not exert its convulsive effect via interaction with benzodiazepinergic or muscarinic receptors.", 
    "49": "The hydrodynamic behaviour of both the soluble and purified gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor of bovine or rat cerebral cortex has been investigated in solution in Triton X-100 or in 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPS). In all the hydrodynamic separations made, it was found that the binding activities for GABA, benzodiazepine, and (where detectable) t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate comigrated. Conditions were established for gel exclusion chromatography and for sucrose density gradient velocity sedimentation that maintain the GABAA receptor in a nonaggregated form. Using these conditions, the molecular weight of the bovine GABAA receptor in the above-mentioned detergents was calculated using the H2O/2H2O method. A value of Mr 230,000-240,000 was calculated for the bovine pure GABAA receptor purified in sodium deoxycholate/Triton X-100 media. A value of Mr 284,000-290,000 was calculated for the nonaggregated bovine or rat cortex receptor in CHAPS, but the Stokes radius is smaller in the latter than in the former medium and the detergent binding in CHAPS is underestimated. Thus the deduced Mr, 240,000, is the best estimate by this method.", 
    "50": "Although peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites have been demonstrated in the brain of various species, the precise identity and function of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor have not been established yet. In light of the recent demonstration of the mitochondrial localization of this receptor and its potential role in intermediary metabolism, we investigated the relationship between the benzodiazepines and the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a component of the mitochondrial membrane. The results obtained in the present study demonstrate a specific interaction between PDH and the ligands for the peripheral-type type benzodiazepine receptor, which might account for their effects on cell growth and differentiation.", 
    "51": "Two patients who developed choreoathetosis in the course of lithium treatment are described, and other cases of choreoathetosis in lithium-treated patients are reviewed. Choreoathetosis is suggested to be a sign of lithium toxicity, almost always accompanied by other signs of neurotoxicity, such as delirium and cerebellar dysfunction. Of the reported cases, 44% developed permanent movement disorders, and 63% of the patients with permanent deficits were taking both lithium and neuroleptic. When choreoathetosis was not permanent, the average duration was seven days after discontinuation of lithium (range, 1 to 90 days).", 
    "52": "Diazepam, a drug with hydrophobic properties, was used as a model for studying its distribution (after intraduodenal administration) into the central lymph of rats. The intestinal lymph, which prevails in the central lymph, was modified for the presence of total lipids (chylomicrons) by means of fasting, a normal or an artificial diet (olive oil). The lymphatic levels of diazepam exceeded the corresponding blood levels in the fed and oil-fed group; the levels were steady in the fasted group with the exception of the absorption phase of the curves. The kinetic parameters assessed in the blood and lymph of the individual groups obtained by mathematical evaluation of the concentration curves differed because of quantitative differences in the presence of chylomicrons in the lymph. Lymphatic bioavailability in comparison with i.v. administration was found to be substantially lower.", 
    "53": "1. In the course of an experiment in which acute effects of perorally applied ethanol alone (0.5 g/kg of body weight) or in combination with diazepam (5 mg) and meclophenoxate (100 mg) on verbal learning were studied, the values of the blood pressure, the body temperature and the heart rate of experimental subject were simultaneously registered with the help of polyphysiograph Physiomat. 2. The method of artificial conditioned speech connections was adopted. The experimental subjects were 16 healthy and unfatigued volunteers - university students (8 females, 8 males, age 21 years). The investigation-sets consisted of two optic, two complex tactile, and two acoustic associations. Three trials were always carried out: before, and one and two hours after the administration of the studied drugs. 3. The values of the blood pressure, the body temperature and the heart rate were not significantly influenced by the applied substances. Only two hours after application of ethanol in combination with diazepam, a marked decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was registered in comparison with the values observed after application of placebo.", 
    "54": "1. Acute effects of ethanol (0.5 g/kg of body weight) and its interactions with diazepam (5 mg) and meclophenoxate (100 mg) and placebo on the higher nervous activity were tested on a group of 16 healthy and unfatigued volunteers-university students (8 females, 8 males, aged 21 years). The experimental subjects were given the following combinations of the studied drugs: (a) Ethanol plus meclophenoxate, (b) Ethanol plus placebo, (c) Ethanol plus diazepam, (d) Placebo solution plus placebo. The method of artificial conditioned speech connections was made use of. Three statistically balanced trials were always carried out: before, and one and two hours after the administration of the tested drug combinations during the early and late forenoon hours. The investigation-sets consisted of two optic, two complex tactile, and two acoustic associations. The criteria for the evaluation of the results were the number of repetitions necessary for mastering the given task, then the number of correct responses and the frequencies of responses in the first eight repetitions of the sets when the active knowledge of the persons under investigation was tested. 2. One hour after the application, there appeared a statistically significant impairment in NNR and NCR, both after ethanol alone and ethanol in combinations with diazepam and meclophenoxate. The frequency of responses was impaired only after the combination of ethanol plus diazepam. 3. Two hours after the administration, the combinations of ethanol plus diazepam and ethanol plus meclophenoxate impaired significantly the number of necessary repetitions. NCR impairment was observed only after application of ethanol with diazepam. Ethanol administered separately did not impair the followed up characteristics of learning. 4. The most marked effect appeared during the formation of artificial conditioned speech connections with acoustic stimuli.", 
    "55": "Two classical and two nonclassical muscarinic agents were tested for their effects on neostriatal acetylcholine (ACh) release. The classical muscarinic antagonist, atropine (0.1-2 microM), increased ACh release in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the 'nonclassical' antagonist, pirenzepine (2-200 microM), had no effect on ACh release. The muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine (1-100 microM), and its analog, oxotremorine-M (0.1-50 microM), both decreased ACh release in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibitory potency of oxotremorine-M was approximately 20 times that of oxotremorine, and the inhibitory effects of both agonists were blocked by atropine. The results obtained with the muscarinic antagonists indicate that 'M-2 type' muscarinic receptors mediate ACh release in the neostriatum, but further pharmacological analyses are required to assign with certainty the receptor subtype involved in neostriatal ACh release.", 
    "56": "In vivo microinjections of cholinergic compounds into the medial pontine reticular formation have produced some or depending on the injection site, all of the phenomena of REM, thus providing the only adequate pharmacological model of this behavioral state. The necessary anatomical substrate, a cholinergic projection to the mPRF was recently demonstrated, however the direct effect of cholinergic agonists on mPRF neurons is unknown. We have examined the effects of carbachol on mPRF neurons recorded in vitro from brainstem slices of Sprague-Dawley rats (8-10 days old). Three kinds of response to the application of carbachol (0.5-1 microM) were observed (n = 15) as follows: a depolarizing response (67%), a hyperpolarizing response (20%) and a biphasic response consisting of a hyperpolarizing response followed by a depolarizing response (13%). Under voltage clamp control, the depolarizing response was observed as an inward current resulting from a decrease in conductance which was constant over the membrane potential range of -100 to -50 mV. Reversal potential was negative to -80 mV. An increase in the excitability of neurons (as measured by responses to identical intracellularly applied depolarizing current pulses) during the depolarizing responses was due to the increase in steady state inward current. When intracellular DC current of equal amplitude but opposite polarity was applied, no increase in excitability was observed. This response was always blocked by the addition of atropine (0.5-1 microM) to the perfusate. The hyperpolarizing response was observed as an increase in outward current due to an increase in conductance with marked voltage sensitivity (over the range of -100 to -50 mV) characteristic of the anomalous rectifier. Preliminary data indicated that the hyperpolarizing response was more sensitive to pirenzepine (complete blockade at 1.0 microM) than the depolarizing response (complete blockade at 2 microM) but neither response was affected by pirenzepine concentrations of 200 nM or less. Cholinergic effects on evoked depolarizing PSPs were examined on neurons with depolarizing (n = 3) and biphasic (n = 1) responses and in all cases, the PSPs were enhanced. This enhancement was blocked by atropine. In conclusion, it is suggested that activation of two different muscarinic receptors (neither of which is the M1 receptor) on mPRF neurons results in two different responses, a decrease in a voltage-insensitive potassium conductance and an increase in the anomalous rectifier.", 
    "57": "Measurement of [Cch] in the bath and in slices demonstrated a considerable concentration discrepancy between the bath and the extracellular space. With fast (bolus) application of Cch this discrepancy is due to the speed of diffusion, while equilibration with continuous application is considerably impaired by cellular uptake of Cch (Creese and Taylor, 1967). Low concentrations (less than or equal to 1 microM) of Cch reduce the afterhyperpolarization following a train of action potentials and depolarize the membrane. Analysis of [Cch]0 (t) and the effects of pirenzepine allowed these effects to be assigned to two different muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "58": "Previous work suggests that the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety is insensitive to the anxiolytic effects of the novel anxiolytic buspirone, which shows an anxiogenic-like profile in this test. This paper examines some of the possible reasons for this and the role that buspirone's agonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors plays in this effect. A variety of 5-HT1A receptor agonists (p-aminophenylethyl-m-trifluromethylphenyl piperazine, (+)- and (-)-MDL 72832) showed similar activity to buspirone, as did the related compound ipsapirone. (-)-MDL 72832 was more potent than (+)-MDL 72832, in keeping with its stereoselective action at 5-HT1A receptors. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist properties of 1-pyrimidinyl piperazine, a metabolite of buspirone, did not appear to be relevant to this action of buspirone as neither it nor idazoxan showed an anxiogenic-like profile. Neither chronic treatment with buspirone (1 mg/kg SC twice a day for 16 days) nor depletion of 5-HT with p-chlorophenylalanine changed the anxiogenic-like activity of buspirone in the elevated plus-maze test. These results suggest that an agonist action at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors mediates the anxiogenic-like effects of buspirone in the elevated plus-maze test and that this test may either be insensitive to certain classes of anxiolytics or is measuring something unrelated to human anxiety states.", 
    "59": "Diazepam, a drug with hydrophobic properties, was used as a model drug for the study of its distribution after i.v. administration into the central lymph of the rat. The intestinal lymph, which prevails in the central lymph, was modified for the presence of total lipids chylomicrons by fasting and a normal or an artificial diet (olive oil). Lymphatic levels of diazepam in all three experimental conditions exceeded the corresponding blood levels, being lowest in the fasted group, higher in the normally fed animals and highest in the oil-fed group. Experimental blood and lymphatic data were subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis. The changes in the parameters were found to depend quantitatively upon the presence of chylomicrons in the lymph. Lymphatic availability of diazepam in the central lymph is stimulated by an increased content of the chylomicrons fraction of the lymph.", 
    "60": "The effects of the acute and chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide on spontaneous motility and on the reactivity of the generator of embryonic motility were studied in chick embryos from the 4th to the 19th day of incubation. 1. The acute administration of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg e.w.) significantly depressed spontaneous motility from the 13th day of incubation. 2. The chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide (12.2 mg/kg e.w./24 h) from the 4th to the 8th, 12th and 16th day of incubation enhanced the reduction of the spontaneous motility of 17-day-old embryos. 3. The chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide significantly modified the activity of both activators (strychnine, metrazol, bicuculline, picrotoxin) and inhibitors (GABA, chlordiazepoxide) of the spontaneous motility of chick embryos.", 
    "61": "The author studied the development of the interaction of GABA and oxazepam on embryonic spontaneous motility in chick embryos during the second half of incubation. In 13-day-old embryos the two substances already potentiated each other's action, despite the fact that GABA, by itself, did not yet have an inhibitory effect. In older embryos this potentiation increased until spontaneous motor activity was almost completely depressed.", 
    "62": "Rats were trained and tested in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task (0.3-mA footshock). Training-test interval was 6 h. In Experiment 1, animals received, 1 h before training, an ip injection of vehicle or diazepam (2.0 mg/kg) and, 30 s after training and/or 30 min prior to testing, ip saline, epinephrine (6.25 micrograms/kg or 125.0 micrograms/kg), naloxone (0.5 mg/kg), or beta-endorphin (1 micrograms/kg). In the vehicle-pretreated animals, post-training epinephrine (6.25 micrograms/kg) and naloxone enhanced, and post-training beta-endorphin and epinephrine (125.0 micrograms/kg) reduced, retention test performance; and pretest beta-endorphin and epinephrine (125.0 micrograms/kg) reversed the latter effect and enhanced retention on their own. Diazepam lowered memory scores on its own and prevented all other drug effects with the exception of post-training facilitation by epinephrine (6.25 micrograms/kg). In previous papers it was shown that post-training facilitation by epinephrine is due to an influence on storage processes, whereas all the other drug effects described above result from the post-training establishment of state dependency to either beta-endorphin or epinephrine, and therefore to a process involving further acquisition and storage. The present findings suggest that diazepam selectively hindered the acquisition and/or storage processes involved in state dependency. This conclusion is strengthened by the findings from Experiment 2, which showed, using a classic 2 x 2 design, that diazepam itself did not induce state dependency but, rather, depressed acquisition and/or storage of the avoidance task.", 
    "63": "Two techniques of total intravenous anaesthesia for laparoscopy were compared in 80 patients. Group 1 received alfentanil, propofol and vecuronium, and Group 2 alfentanil, midazolam, ketamine and vecuronium. Haemodynamic stability after induction and the pressor response to tracheal intubation were significantly different. There was no significant difference in recovery times between the two groups and little difference in other postoperative sequelae.", 
    "64": "A case is presented of a death caused by self-injection of sufentanil and midazolam. Biological fluids and tissues were analyzed for midazolam by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and for sufentanil by GC/MS. Midazolam was extracted from basified fluids or tissues homogenated with n-butyl chloride and analyzed by HPLC by using a phosphate buffer: acetonitrile (60:40) mobile phase on a mu-Bondapak C18 column at 240 nm. Sufentanil was extracted from basified fluids and tissue homogenates with hexane:ethanol (19:1). GC/MS methodology for both compounds consisted of chromatographic separation on a 15-m by 0.25-mm inside diameter (ID) DB-5 (1.0-micron-thick film) bonded phase fused silica capillary column with helium carrier (29 cm/s) splitless injection at 260 degrees C; column 200 degrees C (0.8 min) 10 degrees C/min to 270 degrees C; and electron ionization and multiple ion detection for midazolam (m/z 310), methaqualone (IS, m/z 235), sufentanil (m/z 289), and fentanyl (IS, m/z 245). Sufentanil concentrations were: blood 1.1 ng/mL, urine 1.3 ng/mL, vitreous humor 1.2 ng/mL, liver 1.75 ng/g, and kidney 5.5 ng/g. Midazolam concentrations were: blood 50 ng/mL, urine 300 ng/mL, liver 930 ng/g, and kidney 290 ng/g. Cause of death was attributed to an acute sufentanil/midazolam intoxication and manner of death a suicide.", 
    "65": "Secondary depressive symptomatology in 435 subjects with panic disorder and phobic avoidance was studied before and after alprazolam treatment. No subject who had a primary affective disorder was included. Calculation of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale factor scores revealed that the agitation/anxiety, sleep disturbance, and somatization factors accounted for approximately 75% of the HAM-D total score; these all showed significant improvement with alprazolam treatment. There were few differences in dimensions of depressive symptomatology between those subjects with and those without major depression; the main difference was in the overall intensity of the depression.", 
    "66": "The lymphocyte stimulation responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed (PWM) were investigated in 30 hospitalized depressed women undergoing a dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Patients were classified according to DSM-III as having major depression with melancholia, without melancholia, and minor depression. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were measured. Patients with major depression showed significantly decreased lymphocyte stimulation induced by PHA, Con A, and PWM as compared to those with minor depression. These differences could not be attributed to age, body weight, weight loss, total number of leukocytes, menopausal status, sleep disturbances, concomitant use of low-dosage benzodiazepines or length of drug-free period before testing. The group mean differences in lymphocyte stimulation counts were not affected by the severity of illness or the severity of state and trait anxiety. There were no significant differences in the lymphocyte responses to PHA, Con A, and PWM between DST non-suppressors and DST suppressors. No significant correlations were established between baseline and post dexamethasone cortisol values and the lymphocyte stimulation counts.", 
    "67": "Thirty consecutive lactate-sensitive panic disorder patients were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the relationship between temporal lobe abnormalities and panic disorder. Neuroanatomical abnormalities, most involving the right temporal lobe, were found in 43% of patients, compared with 10% of the control subjects. Patients with temporal lobe abnormalities were significantly younger at the onset of panic disorder and had more panic attacks compared with patients with normal MRI scans (p less than .05). These results suggest that panic disorder could be secondary to temporal lobe dysfunctions and that panic disorder patients with abnormal MRIs could have a worse prognosis than those with normal MRIs and would require long-term pharmacological treatment.", 
    "68": "The central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg), given ip 30 min prior to training, enhanced retention test performance of step-down inhibitory avoidance in rats. A lower dose (2.0 mg/kg) given pre-training, or post-training was ineffective. The effect of flumazenil seems to result from an influence on acquisition, in spite of the fact that the drug did not alter training session performance. Pre-training flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) also facilitated retention test performance of habituation to a buzzer, but not of habituation to an open field. The effect of flumazenil is not attributable to a general influence on inhibitory learning for the following reasons: 1) it enhanced acquisition of two different tasks in which behavioral inhibition plays entirely different roles; 2) it enhanced acquisition of one form of habituation but not of another; 3) data from the literature indicate that flumazenil also enhances acquisition of active avoidance. In the present experiments, the two tasks that were sensitive to the drug were more stressful or \"anxiogenic\" than the open field task. There is evidence from the literature that stress activates endogenous benzodiazepine-mediated mechanisms in the brain. The effect of flumazenil suggests that acquisition in stressful or anxiogenic circumstances may be normally down-regulated by such mechanisms.", 
    "69": "Drosophila embryos, because of their high proportion of dividing nuclei, offer many advantages for the study of the mitotic cycle. In the present study we combined immunofluorescence with interference contrast techniques to follow centrosome and spindle behavior in embryos exposed to diazepam during the first stages of development. Exposure to 100 micrograms/ml of diazepam produced polyploid and aneuploid figures resulting from the unusual fusion of one or more adjacent spindles. Diazepam also causes the inhibition of centrosome shifting and induces the formation of monopolar spindles during the metaphase-anaphase transition.", 
    "70": "The specific benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist flumazenil is indicated when the CNS-depressant effects of a BZD must be quickly attenuated or terminated. Following the i.v.-injection of flumazenil the reliable antagonistic action can be observed within 0.5 to 2 minutes. Due to its rapid hepatic elimination (t1/2 approximately 0.8-1.2 h; systemic clearance approximately 700-1,200 ml/min) with a single dose of 0.2 to 1 mg, the desired level of consciousness is attained for only about 2 hours. Flumazenil is well tolerated, and whether its weak intrinsic effects are of some clinical relevance remains to be elucidated.", 
    "71": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two partial benzodiazepine inverse agonists, RO15-4513 and FG-7142, alone and in combination with ethanol on locomotor activity in C57BL/6 mice. When administered alone, 1.5 g/kg ethanol did not significantly influence activity, confirming previous reports indicating this mouse strain is relatively insensitive to the excitatory properties of ethanol. RO15-4513 treatment also did not significantly influence locomotor activity when administered alone. However, coadministration of RO15-4513 (1.5-6 mg/kg) and ethanol markedly increased locomotor activity. Moreover, the unmasking of ethanol's stimulant action by RO15-4513 (6 mg/kg) was completely reversed by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO15-1788. In contrast, FG-7142 (10-20 mg/kg) increased activity to the same extent in both saline and ethanol-injected mice. This effect was blocked by RO15-1788 pretreatment as well. Neither RO15-4513, FG-7142, nor RO15-1788 significantly influenced blood ethanol concentrations. It is suggested that RO15-4513 unmasked the stimulant effects of ethanol by virtue of its ability to antagonize the depressant properties of ethanol in C57BL/6 mice.", 
    "72": "In summary, there are a number of factors to be considered in abuse liability testing such as the purpose of the testing and its potential applications that determine which subject population we should employ. Furthermore, we should not expect to see a perfect correlation between abuse liability testing and the actual abuse of these drugs because there are many factors that will modulate or modify whether or not abuse liability becomes activated and the abuse of any specific drug becomes a social problem.", 
    "73": "Reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation by flumazenil has been reported to produce no or minor hemodynamic alterations although some adverse responses have been observed. To better delineate circulatory and adrenergic modifications induced by flumazenil, 20 consenting patients scheduled for short orthopedic procedures were included in a double blind controlled study. Anesthesia consisted in flunitrazepam (30 to 40 micrograms.kg-1) plus halothane (0.5 vol. % in N2O-O2, 60-40 vol. %) and alfentanil. At the end of surgery, patients received 15 minutes after discontinuation of halothane and N2O, either flumazenil (1 mg) or placebo according th randomization. Heart rate and blood pressure were obtained before reversal and repeatedly for 30 minutes following flumazenil or placebo. Level of consciousness was also assessed and blood samples were withdrawn for subsequent determination of plasma levels of norepinephrine. Flumazenil administration induced in all cases an immediate and total reversion of sedation while recovery was slow in the placebo group. No significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure values were found in both groups. By contrast, plasma levels of norepinephrine were significantly increased in all patients. It is concluded that reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation or anesthesia is not associated with significant variations of usual hemodynamic or adrenergic responses.", 
    "74": "The goal of this study was to assess the degree of postoperative anxiety flumazenil might provide in patients when used to reverse the sedation induced by midazolam. Twenty-four patients, aged 18 to 60 yrs, and scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery of the upper limb, were included in the study Regional anaesthesia (brachial plexus block) was carried out 20 min after the patient had been premedicated with 0.15 mg.kg-1 intramuscular midazolam. When the block was clinically complete, 0.12 mg.kg-1 midazolam was given intravenously. Sedation was maintained throughout surgery using 0.03 mg.kg-1 midazolam every quarter of an hour (mean total dose 0.206 mg.kg-1). At the end of the procedure, the patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups: A+, the patients were given 0.1 mg intravenous flumazenil repeated every min until the patient was fully awake (mean 4.5 +/- 2.6 micrograms.kg-1); and A-, the patients were allowed to recover spontaneously. A wakefulness, and a determination just before premedication (E1, P1, H1 respectively). The degree of recovery was assessed in both groups, and, when the value of the wakefulness test had returned to that of E1 (E2) (E2 = E1), P2 and H2 were carried out. There were no statistically significant differences between P1 and P2, and between H1 and H2, and this for either group of patients. So, the doses of flumazenil used, which awoke all the patients within 3 min, did not create any anxiety. In accordance with most of the recently published studies, flumazenil can be safely used to reverse benzodiazepine induced sedation.", 
    "75": "The effects of 0.2 mg/kg orally administered diazepam and of a placebo on explicit memory, implicit and knowledge memory were assessed using a free recall task, a word-stem completion task and two category-generation tasks. Twenty four healthy volunteers took part in this double-blind study. Diazepam impaired explicit but not implicit memory. The drug also spared knowledge memory. Explicit memory was linked with the diazepam-induced sedation and with the self-rated affective load of to-be remembered words, but implicit memory was not. The diazepam-induced dissociation between explicit and implicit memory supports the notion of two distinct forms of memory and reproduced the dissociation observed in organic amnesia.", 
    "76": "A place conditioning paradigm was used to examine the affective properties of FG 7142, a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist. At the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg, IP), FG 7142 produced a significant place aversion to the drug-paired compartment. In a second experiment, haloperidol injections were given before FG 7142. It was found that haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the measured conditioned place aversion produced by FG 7142, without exhibiting any aversive or rewarding effects by itself. These results suggest that dopamine receptors are involved in the learning or expression of conditioned place aversion induced by benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists.", 
    "77": "This study analyzed the effects of 1 week administration of alprazolam (AL; 0.25 mg), lorazepam (LO; 1 mg) and placebo (PL) on sleep as well as their residual effects on attention upon awakening. Under a crossed, double-blind design, six healthy male volunteer subjects between 19 and 30 years of age were studied. After two habituation sessions and a control session, each substance was given orally, twice a day for 7 days, with a 1-week washout period between administrations. At the end of each administration period, sleep studies were conducted from 2300 to 0700 hours. Evaluation of attention was carried out by means of a simple visuomotor reaction time (RT) task, and a time estimation (TE) task, that started at 0700 hours, lasting 1 h. Neither drug significantly affected any sleep variable. Both benzodiazepines tended to increase RT, but only LO did so significantly at the beginning of the attention test. No significant changes in predictive and failure responses during the RT task were produced by either drug. Also, no significant changes were observed in the TE. Even though only LO produced a significant increase of RT at the selected doses and with 1 week administration, it is suggested that both benzodiazepines could have residual effects on attention.", 
    "78": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam were studied in 15 normal, healthy, non-obese volunteers. Placebo capsules and capsules containing 20, 40, and 60 mg adinazolam mesylate were administered as single oral doses in a randomized, 4-way crossover design. Plasma concentrations of adinazolam and mono-N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD) were determined by HPLC. Psychomotor performance and memory tests were performed and the degree of sedation assessed at designated times following drug administration. Adinazolam and NDMAD pharmacokinetics were linear throughout the dosage range studied. The ratio of NDMAD to adinazolam area under the curve was approximately 4:1. Dose-related decrements in psychomotor performance and memory were observed up to 8 h after dosing (P less than 0.025 in all cases). Psychomotor performance decrements correlated more closely with NDMAD plasma concentrations than with adinazolam concentrations. These results suggest that NDMAD is responsible for a significant degree of the sedative and psychomotor effects observed after the administration of adinazolam.", 
    "79": "Ten patients with Alzheimer's disease and ten age-matched normal controls were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled acute trial of 1 mg PO lorazepam to test the effects of low-dose benzodiazepine on memory and behavior in a mostly older population. Cognitive effects differed somewhat between Alzheimer patients and normal controls, with Alzheimer patients revealing predominantly \"attentional\" impairments and age-matched controls showing possible \"disinhibition.\" Specifically, Alzheimer patients made more omission errors on a continuous performance task, whereas controls made more commission and intrusion errors with lorazepam versus placebo. This low dose of lorazepam (1 mg), which was associated with mild but statistically significant sedation in both groups, also produced no significant decrease in recent memory or in access to semantic memory. These cognitive findings contrast markedly to the reported effects of scopolamine on recent memory; therefore, supporting the idea that cholinergic interruption has a more specific effect on human memory and on learning than that of low-dose benzodiazepines. Further studies with a wider dose range of benzodiazepines are necessary to evaluate the possibility of differential sensitivity between Alzheimer patients and normal elderly controls.", 
    "80": "Muramyl dipeptide increased sleep during the dark-phase, but not the light-phase of the rats' sleep-awake cycle. This circadian variation may be due to the inability of MDP to increase sleep over the high baseline levels of sleep that occur during the light-phase. However, MDP was pyrogenic during the light-phase, indicating it was pharmacologically active. In the dark-phase, MDP was not pyrogenic, but when compared to concurrent vehicle-treated rats, rats treated with MDP did not demonstrate as great a fall in body temperature. At approximately equisomnogenic doses, MDP produced less potentiation of ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex than triazolam, indicating it produces less non-specific central nervous system depressant effects. These data indicate the possibility of a new generation of hypnotic agents derived from muramyl peptides."
