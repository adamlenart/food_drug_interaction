    "0": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is highly prevalent in primary care patients and is a source of major morbidity. The low rate of recognition and diagnosis of GAD is often the result of insufficient knowledge on the part of primary care physicians, time pressures, and competing demands during patients' visits. Patient attribution of symptoms and the stigma related to mental illness also contribute to underrecognition. Other contributing factors include the natural history of GAD, the bimodal age of presentation, a chronic but waxing and waning course, frequent comorbidity with other anxiety and depressive disorders, and the controversy regarding the best diagnostic criteria. However, proper diagnosis is critical to appropriate management. Primary care management of GAD and associated comorbidities includes education about the nature of GAD as a medical disorder that is amenable to treatment and counseling about treatment alternatives and coping strategies. Most patients with GAD suffer from insomnia, and treating insomnia can be of great benefit to them. While cognitive-behavioral therapy and relaxation therapy are effective in treating GAD, most patients in primary care settings are likely to require pharmacologic treatment. Although commonly used, benzodiazepines and their short-term benefits are overshadowed by their decreased long-term effectiveness, their minimal treatment of psychic symptoms, and their degradation of patient performance. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is indicated for the short-term treatment of GAD, although adequate data supporting the use of most SSRIs for GAD are not yet available. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine provides a treatment option resulting in both short- and long-term improvement of symptoms, attaining not only a response but also remission from GAD and prevention of relapse.", 
    "1": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronic worry that may persist for many years. It is a debilitating disorder, and effective long-term treatment is required. Psychotherapy, particularly relaxation, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, has shown long-term benefit in GAD and may be a useful approach alone and as an adjunct to pharmacotherapeutic options. Available medications for GAD include benzodiazepine anxiolytics, buspirone, and antidepressants. Although benzodiazepines are effective as short-term anxiolytics, their use is compromised by a poor adverse event profile and, like buspirone, they lack the antidepressant efficacy important for addressing the comorbid depression experienced by many patients with GAD. Antidepressants, including paroxetine and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, are effective anxiolytics and resolve symptoms of depression in patients with GAD. The benefit of venlafaxine is sustained long term, enabling increased numbers of patients to attain remission from symptoms and experience restoration of normal functioning. Although further clinical studies are required to establish the use of psychosocial therapy in the treatment of GAD. preliminary results are encouraging. At present, the use of psychosocial therapy and second-generation antidepressants, such as some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine, offer the best approach to attaining long-term benefit for patients with GAD.", 
    "2": "Rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-(R)-aminoindan) is a selective, irreversible monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) inhibitor which has been developed as an anti-Parkinson drug. In controlled monotherapy and as adjunct to L-dopa it has shown anti-Parkinson activity. In cell culture (PC-12 and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells) it exhibits neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic activity against several neurotoxins (SIN-1, MPTP, 6-hydroxydopamine and N-methyl-(R)-salsolinol) and ischemia. In vivo, it reduces the sequelae of traumatic brain injury in mice and speeds their recovery. The neuroprotective activity of rasagaline does not result from MAO B inhibition, since its S-enantiomer, TVP1022, which has 1000-fold weaker MAO inhibitory activity, exhibits similar neuroprotective properties. Introduction of a carbamate moiety into the rasagiline molecule to confer cholinesterase inhibitory activity for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, resulted in compounds TV3326 [(N-Propargyl-(3R)Aminoindan-5-YL)-Ethyl Methyl Carbamate] and its S-enantiomer TV3279 [(N-Propargyl-(3S)Aminoindan-5-YL)-Ethyl Methyl Carbamate], which retain the neuroprotective activities of rasagiline and TVP1022. They also antagonize scopolamine-induced impairments in spatial memory. In addition, TV3326 exhibits brain-selective MAO A and B inhibitory activity after chronic administration and has antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test. This is associated with an increase in brain levels of serotonin. The anti-apoptotic activity of these propargylamine-containing derivatives may be related to their ability to delay the opening of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), which are part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The propargylamine moiety is responsible for the increase in the mitochondrial family of Bcl-2 proteins, prevention in the fall in mitochondrial membrane potential, prevention of the activation of caspase 3, and of translocation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The latter processes are closely associated with neurotoxin-induced apoptosis. Rasagiline interacts with and prevents the binding of PKI 1195 to the pro-apoptotic peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, which together with Bcl-2, hexokinase, porin, and adenine nucleotide translocator constitutes part of the VDAC. Furthermore, rasagiline, TV3326 and TV3279 are able to influence the processing of amyloid precursor protein by activation of alpha-secretase and increasing the release of soluble alpha APP in rat PC-12 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in rat and mice cortex and hippocampus. This process has been shown to involve the upregulation of PKC and MAP kinase. It is quite likely that the induction of Bcl-2 and activation of PKC by rasagiline and TV3326 is closely linked to the anti-apoptotic action of these drugs and their ability to process APP by activation of alpha-secretase.", 
    "3": "On a wintry day a 29-year-old woman was found dead beside her car showing head injuries and signs of hypothermia. Several empty packets of sedative and hypnotic drugs were lying inside the car. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of flunitrazepam (heart blood of the left and right chamber 0.033 mg/L each), norflunitrazepam (left heart blood 0.029 mg/L, right heart blood 0.027 mg/L), 7-amino-flunitrazepam (left heart blood 0.090 mg/L, right heart blood 0.104 mg/L), diazepam (left heart blood 0.395 mg/L, right heart blood 0.386 mg/L), nordazepam (left heart blood 0.112 mg/L, right heart blood 0.115 mg/L) and temazepam (left heart blood 0.034 mg/L, right heart blood 0.033 mg/L). Neither alcohol nor other drugs were found. It was concluded that benzodiazepine intake led to a disturbance of consciousness. Whether the woman died in this situation due to the icy temperature as a result of hypothermia or whether she died or would have died solely due to benzodiazepine overdosage could not be clarified.", 
    "4": "When parenteral treatments are indicated for acutely disturbed behaviour, previous guidelines have recommended droperidol or haloperidol in combination with benzodiazepines.

For the patients treated with olanzapine, caloric intake, resting energy expenditure, and physical activity (determined through accelerometry and heart rate monitoring) were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment.", 
    "15": "Body mass index significantly increased in those treated with olanzapine but not in those given haloperidol. The increase in body mass index was due to an increase in caloric intake without change in diet composition. Olanzapine had no significant effect on resting energy expenditure.

Patients treated with olanzapine exhibited improvement in the general and attention domains but not more than that observed with other treatments. Patients treated with risperidone exhibited improvement in memory that was superior to that of both clozapine and haloperidol. Clozapine yielded improvement in motor function but not more than in other groups. Average effect sizes for change were in the small to medium range. More than half of the patients treated with olanzapine and risperidone experienced \"clinically significant\" improvement (changes in score of at least one-half standard deviation relative to baseline). These findings did not appear to be mediated by changes in symptoms, side effects, or blood levels of medications.",

The Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used to quantify manic and depressive symptoms, respectively. Safety was assessed with several measures.", 
    "23": "The protocol defined baseline-to-endpoint improvement in the mean total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale as the primary outcome variable. The mean Young Mania Rating Scale score decreased by 13.4 for patients treated with olanzapine (N=125) and 10.4 for those treated with divalproex (N=123). A priori categorizations defined response and remission rates: 54.4% of olanzapine-treated patients responded (> or = 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale score), compared to 42.3% of divalproex-treated patients; 47.2% of olanzapine-treated patients had remission of mania symptoms (endpoint Young Mania Rating Scale < or = 12), compared to 34.1% of divalproex-treated patients. The decrease in Hamilton depression scale score was similar in the two treatment groups. Completion rates for the 3-week study were similar in both groups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence >10%) occurring more frequently during treatment with olanzapine were dry mouth, increased appetite, and somnolence. For divalproex, nausea was more frequently observed. The average weight gain with olanzapine treatment was 2.5 kg, compared to 0.9 kg with divalproex treatment.", 
    "24": "The olanzapine treatment group had significantly greater mean improvement of mania ratings and a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving protocol-defined remission, compared with the divalproex treatment group. Significantly more weight gain and cases of dry mouth, increased appetite, and somnolence were reported with olanzapine, while more cases of nausea were reported with divalproex.", 
    "25": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease of unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Clinically, there are combinations of extrapyramidal, cerebellar, pyramidal and autonomic dysfunctions. Diagnosis is sorted into different categories according to criteria. The appearance of hallucinations unrelated to medication is considered to be a criterion of exclusion for the diagnosis of MSA. A case is described in which delusional parasitosis occurred as a possible initial syndrome of MSA. The simultaneous appearance of MSA and a psychotic disease is possible and has been described repeatedly. Therefore, this criterion of exclusion is discussed. Delusional parasitosis is an unspecific syndrome of multifactorial genesis. Partial remission of the monothematic symptomatology of delusion shows that a continuous and consequent therapy with neuroleptics seems to be promising. In the case presented, the good efficacy of olanzapine in low dosage over an extended period of time is described.", 
    "26": "The object of this work was to subject established empirical medical treatment regimens for infantile spasms to evidence-based medicine analysis in order to determine the current best practice for the treatment of infantile spasms in children. Clinical studies of infantile spasms reported during the presteroid era were reviewed critically to define the natural history of the disorder. Treatment trials of infantile spasms conducted since 1958 were rigorously assessed using MEDLINE and hand searches of the English language literature. Inclusion criteria were the documented presence of infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia. Outcome measures included complete cessation of spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, relapse rate, developmental outcome, the presence or absence of epilepsy, and/or an epileptiform electroencephalogram. Evidence was defined as class I, II, or III, and practice parameter recommendations were made using the framework devised by the American Academy of Neurology. Class I and III evidence support a standard of practice recommendation for the use of vigabatrin in the treatment of infantile spasms in children with tuberous sclerosis. Class I and III evidence support a guidelines recommendation for the use of either ACTH or vigabatrin in infantile spasms in nontuberous sclerosis patients. There is no strong evidence that successful treatment of infantile spasms improves the long-term prognosis for cognitive outcome or decreases the incidence of later epilepsy. A practice option recommendation for the use of oral corticosteroids in the treatment of infantile spasms is supported by limited and inconclusive class I and III data. Based on the evidence, no recommendation can be made for the use of pyridoxine, benzodiazepines, or the newer antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH and vigabatrin are the most effective agents in the treatment of infantile spasms, but concerns remain about the risk/benefit profiles of these drugs.", 
    "27": "Insomnia is a problem in all stages of life but is particularly common after age 65. A number of factors--including advanced age, psychosocial influences, medical illness, and the use of medications and alcohol--may disturb sleep architecture. Evaluation of insomnia in the older patient requires a careful history and physical examination, supplemented by a sleep diary. Treatment of underlying conditions and nonpharmacologic improvements in sleep hygiene are first-line therapy, but pharmacologic agents such as benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, or antidepressants may be needed. Nonbenzodiazepines with rapid elimination may offer a lower side-effect profile than other hypnotic agents when used for insomnia in the older population.", 
    "28": "An SPME-HPLC-UV method for the determination of delorazepam, a representative benzodiazepine, in spiked human urine samples was developed for the first time. The performances of two commercially available fibers, a carbowax/templated resin (Carbowax/TPR-100) and a polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), were compared, indicating the latter as the most suitable for urine samples analysis. All the aspects influencing adsorption (extraction time, pH, temperature, salt addition) and desorption (desorption and injection time, desorption solvent mixture composition) of the analyte on the fiber have been investigated. In particular, short extraction times were necessary to reach the equilibrium and very short desorption times were employed. The procedure required simple sample pre-treatment and was able to detect 5 ng/ml in spiked urine, regardless of the complexity of the matrix.", 
    "29": "In this article, we report the first randomized double-blind controlled study of the use of psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) vs. a single dose of benzodiazepine (diazepam) for treating acute alcoholic withdrawal states. In previous studies, it was demonstrated that a single treatment of PAN was sufficient to reverse 90% of acute alcoholic withdrawal states within the first 60 minutes of administration with lasting effect in a single-blind manner. Despite the small sample used (n = 23), the gas was significantly more effective than the benzodiazepine at the P = 0.05 level when compared at 120 minutes. This study provides further support for previous findings that show PAN is a safe, rapid and effective therapy for acute mild to moderately severe withdrawal states.", 
    "30": "Diagnosis criteria of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) include progressive, fluctuating muscular rigidity and spasms with normal neurological examination. The presence of unusual features such as prominent limb rigidity with segmental signs and contracture, evidence of brainstem dysfunction, profound autonomic disturbances, CSF pleiocytosis or MRI abnormalities in patients with SPS presentation allows to classify these patients as progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PER). We report a 50 year-old woman suffering from severe painful spasms of abdominal wall and limb muscles. Neurological examination showed pyramidal signs. EMG disclosed continuous muscle activity with superimposed discharges. Treatment with high doses of diazepam and baclofen led to moderate improvement of generalised stiffness. However, the right arm became more rigid with oedema and vasomotor changes. Subsequently, bilateral nystagmus and internuclear opthalmplegia appeared. There was mild CSF pleiocytosis. Associated auto-immune thyroiditis was found with positive anti-microsome antibodies and decreased thyroid hormones. Search for profound neoplasm was negative. The patient had three subacute bouts then she improved with methylprednisolone. The initial clinical presentation mimicking a SPS with subsequent diffuse involvement of the central nervous system and a striking localisation of a severe rigidity to one arm allowed to suspect the diagnosis of PER. The relationship between SPS and PER remains unclear because of the rarity of these disorders. The observation reported in this paper gives evidence that both the disorders are probably two clinical presentations of the same pathogenic process.", 
    "31": "Insomnia in children is a nonspecific impairing symptom that may be the result of normal developmental changes, psychosocial duress, a sleep disorder, a psychiatric disorder, other medical disorders, substance misuse, or an adverse effect of medication. Careful clinical assessment of insomnia in children may include the use of symptom rating scales, laboratory testing, or other medical assessment. Short- and long-term treatment of insomnia in children involves management of etiological factors and associated syndromes. Controlled treatment studies of pediatric insomnia are limited to <10 published studies of psychosocial and/or psychopharmacological treatment in young children. Directive parent education and behavior modification techniques have been effective in short-term treatment of insomnia in young children, and may be the preferred treatment of extrinsic insomnia, as well as an important adjunctive treatment of any insomnia symptoms. Two benzodiazepines [flurazepam and delorazepam (chlordesmethyldiazepam)], one antihistamine (niaprazine) and one phenothiazine [alimemazine (trimeprazine)] have been shown to be effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia in young children, although none of these agents have US Food and Drug Administration approval for pediatric insomnia. Short-acting benzodiazepines may have a role in the brief treatment of pediatric insomnia associated with an anxiety or mood disorder, psychosis, aggression, medication- induced activation, or anticipatory anxiety associated with a medical procedure. However, tachyphylaxis and risk of misuse preclude the long-term use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of insomnia in children. Newer hypnotics, which appear better tolerated than the benzodiazepines in studies of adults, may have a role when combined with psychosocial treatments of pediatric insomnia. Treatment of intrinsic pediatric insomnia may additionally involve chronotherapy or medical management.", 
    "32": "Open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) is an alternative approach to conventional CEC. The primary advantage of OT-CEC is the elimination of problems associated with frits and silica particles in conventional CEC. This report is an investigation of the utility of using a polymeric surfactant (molecular micelle) for OT-CEC. In this approach, fused-silica capillaries coated with thin films of physically adsorbed charged polymers are developed by use of a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coating procedure. The PEM coating is constructed in situ by alternating rinses with positively and negatively charged polymers, where the negatively charged polymer is a molecular micelle. This can offer a number of advantages for separation of hydrophobic analytes. In this study, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) was used as the cationic polymer and poly(sodium N-undecanoyl-L-glycinate) was used as the anionic polymer for PEM coating. The performance of the modified capillaries as a separation medium is evaluated by use of seven benzodiazepines as analytes. The run-to-run, day-to-day, week-to-week, and capillary-to-capillary reproducibilities of electroosmotic flow are very good with relative standard deviation values of less than 1% in all cases. In addition, the chromatographic performance of the monomeric form of the molecular micelle is compared for the separation of these analytes. The PEM-coated capillary was remarkably robust with more than 200 runs accomplished in this study. Strong stability against extreme pH values was also observed. The general utility of this approach is discussed in detail.", 
    "33": "This study evaluated partial antagonism of tiletamine-zolazepam (TZ) anesthesia in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and differences between two benzodiazepine antagonists, flumazenil and sarmazenil, in this species. Four cheetahs were anesthetized three times at an interval of 14 days with an average intramuscular dose of 4.2 mg/kg TZ. In trials 2 and 3 flumazenil at 0.031 mg/kg and sarmazenil at 0.1 mg/kg, respectively, were applied intramuscularly 30 min after initial TZ injection. There was a highly significant difference between the duration of TZ anesthesia with and without antagonist. Use of the antagonists significantly shortened duration and recovery and eliminated excitatory behavior during the recovery phase. No significant differences could be determined between the two antagonists. We recommend the use of sarmazenil and flumazenil to antagonize TZ anesthesia in cheetahs.", 
    "34": "Recent evidence suggests that muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the M2 subtype serve as autoreceptors modulating acetylcholine (ACh) release in prefrontal cortex. The potential contribution of M2 autoreceptors to excitability control of prefrontal cortex has not been investigated. The present study tested the hypothesis that M2 autoreceptors contribute to activation of the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) in C57BL/6J (B6) mouse. This hypothesis was evaluated using microdialysis delivery of the muscarinic antagonist AF-DX116 (3 nM) while simultaneously quantifying ACh release in prefrontal cortex, number of 7- to 14-Hz EEG spindles, and EEG power spectral density. Mean ACh release in prefrontal cortex was significantly increased (P < 0.0002) by AF-DX116. The number of 7- to 14-Hz EEG spindles caused by halothane anesthesia was significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) by dialysis delivery of AF-DX116 to prefrontal cortex. The cholinergically induced cortical activation was characterized by a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in slow-wave EEG power. Together, these neurochemical and EEG data support the conclusion that M2 autoreceptor enhancement of ACh release in prefrontal cortex activates EEG in contralateral prefrontal cortex of B6 mouse. EEG slow-wave activity varies across mouse strains, and the results encourage comparative phenotyping of cortical ACh release and EEG in additional mouse models.", 
    "35": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurologic emergency with a high mortality. Immediate recognition and rapid treatment are essential. After initial stabilization of airway and circulation, the patient should be treated as soon as possible with an intravenous (IV) benzodiazepine, followed immediately by IV fosphenytoin. If SE persists, general anesthesia should be initiated, with intubation and cardiac monitoring. Electroencephalogram must also be monitored to ensure suppression of all seizures. Etiology of SE should be assessed through history, examination, blood tests, and brain imaging.", 
    "36": "A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay was developed for the determination of estazolam in human plasma. Estazolam and alprazolam as an internal standard were detected by ultraviolet absorbance at 240 nm. Estazolam in plasma was extracted by a rapid and simple procedure based on cyanopropyl bonded-phase extraction. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a reversed-phase C8-5 column using a mobile phase of 0.5% potassium dihydrogenphosphate(pH 4.5)-acetonitrile (70:30, v/v). The determination of estazolam was possible in the concentration range of 1.0 - 200.0 ng/mL. The mean recovery of estazolam added to plasma was 96.1 +/- 1.5% with coefficients of variation of less than 5.5%. This method is applicable for accurately monitoring the plasma level of estazolam in healthy subjects participating in scientific research.", 
    "37": "Alprazolam (AL), a benzodiazepine which activates gamma-amino butyrric acid (GABA)-ergic receptors, exerts a clear inhibitory effect on the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and is able to markedly reduce the ACTH response to metyrapone-induced inhibition of glucocorticoid feedback. It has been suggested that its inhibitory action could be regulated by CRH or AVP mediated mechanisms. However, the effect of benzodiazepines on the HPA response to CRH or AVP is contradictory. It has been shown that benzodiazepines have specific receptors on the adrenal gland but it is unclear if they mediate biological effects in humans. In order to further clarify the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of benzodiazepine on HPA axis in humans, we studied the effect of AL (0.02 mg/kg po at -90 min) or placebo in 7 healthy young volunteers (7 female, age: 26-34 yr; wt: 50-58 kg, BMI 20-22 kg/m2) on: 1) the ACTH and cortisol responses to hCRH (2.0 microg/kg iv at 0 min) or AVP (0.17 U/kg im at 0 min); 2) the cortisol, aldosterone and DHEA responses to ACTH 1-24 (0.06 and 250 microg iv at 0 and 60 min, respectively). After placebo, the ACTH and cortisol responses to hCRH (peaks, mean+/-SE: 29.8+/-4.4 pg/ml and 199.3+/-19.6 microg/l) were similar to those recorded after AVP (31.7+/-6.5 pg/ml and 164.8+/-18.0 microg/l); the cortisol response to 0.06 microg ACTH (190.4+/-11.8 microg/l) was similar to that recorded after hCRH and AVP but lower (p<0.01) than that after 250 microg ACTH (260.6+/-17.4 microg/l). AL did not modify the ACTH response to both hCRH (42.5+/-7.1 pg/ml) and AVP (33.3+/-2.7 pg/ml), which even showed a trend toward increase. AL also failed to significantly modify the cortisol response to both hCRH (156.3+/-12.7 microg/l) and AVP (119.4+/-14.5 microg/l), which, on the other hand, showed a trend toward decrease. The cortisol peaks after 0.06 microg ACTH were significantly reduced (p<0.02) by AL pre-treatment (115.0+/-7.7 microg/l) which, in turn, did not modify the cortisol response to the subsequent ACTH bolus (214.7+/-16.6 microg/l). The DHEA and aldosterone responses to all the ACTH doses were not significantly modified by AL. In conclusion, these data show that the HPA response to AVP as well as to hCRH is refractory to the inhibitory effect of AL which, in turn, blunts the cortisol response to low ACTH dose. These findings suggest that both CRH- and AVP-mediated mechanisms could underlie the CNS-mediated inhibitory effect of AL on HPA axis; in the meantime, these results suggest that benzodiazepines could also act on adrenal gland by blunting the sensitivity of the fasciculata zone to ACTH.",

    "41": "Panic disorder and social phobia are among the most disabling of the anxiety disorders. The emotional cost to the patient suffering from these diagnoses is exceeded only by the very real economic costs to the community because of reduced productivity, lost workdays, and increased health care costs for associated physical complaints. It is imperative, therefore, that the medical community focus on the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of these potentially devastating conditions. Pharmacologic treatments for panic disorder and social phobia have been available since the early 1960s. The limited efficacy and significant side effects of the early medications, however, led to a search for new treatment options. For many years, the benzodiazepines were the principal first-line therapy for treatment of these illnesses. Yet, their potential for cognitive impairment, physiological dependence, abuse, and withdrawal phenomena warranted a continued search for newer agents with an improved safety profile. In the last 10 years, several treatments have been identified that may fill this need. Controlled trials and/or anecdotal reports have shown SSRIs and anticonvulsants to be effective treatments for the symptoms of panic disorder and social phobia. However, although SSRIs are emerging as a leading treatment for generalized social phobia, it is not at all clear whether they can benefit nongeneralized social phobia. Their side-effect profile, while a marked improvement over earlier antidepressant drugs, still can cause significant discomfort. The anticonvulsants are now emerging as a very important group of drugs in the anxiety disorders, with gabapentin having been the most extensively studied in social phobia.", 
    "42": "It is now well demonstrated that several anticonvulsants have a role in the treatment of neuropathic pain and also in withdrawal from benzodiazepines, sedatives, and perhaps alcohol. Valproic acid, carbamazepine, gabapentin, clonazepam, and lamotrigine are appropriate treatments for neuropathic pain, effective to a degree dependent on the underlying pathophysiology. While less effective than newer agents, there are situations in which phenytoin remains useful. Currently, a limited understanding of both the processes responsible for pain and the specific effects of each agent prevents prediction of individual response to these drugs, often necessitating trials of several drugs before the best one is found. It is interesting that the anticonvulsant drugs most useful for neuropathic pain are the same ones effective in sedative withdrawal, bipolar disorder, and several anxiety disorders.

We investigated the effects on ROS production in 22 adult ASA physical status I-II patients sedated with small-dose propofol infusion and IV midazolam undergoing elective total knee replacement under intrathecal anesthesia, allocated randomly to one of two groups. In the Propofol group, sedation was performed with propofol 0.2 mg/kg followed by infusion at a rate of 2 mg. kg(-1). h(-1). In the Control group, IV midazolam 5 mg was given. ROS production was measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence analysis. Blood samples were obtained from the radial artery after spinal anesthesia, 1 min before release of the tourniquet and 5 and 20 min after reperfusion. The ischemic time was approximately 70 min. ROS production decreased nonsignificantly before reperfusion in both groups but increased significantly 5 and 20 min after reperfusion in the Midazolam group. In the Propofol group, no significant increase of ROS production was found. We conclude that small-dose propofol infusion attenuates ROS production in tourniquet-induced ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

Forty-five patients undergoing knee surgery with a thigh tourniquet were randomly allocated into 3 groups of 15 patients each: epidural morphine (EM; epidural administration of 17 mL of 2% lidocaine plus 2 mg of morphine, followed by IV injection of 0.2 mL of normal saline), IV morphine (IVM; 17 mL of 2% lidocaine plus 0.2 mL of normal saline, followed by IVM 2 mg IV), and control (17 mL of 2% lidocaine plus 0.2 mL of normal saline, followed by 0.2 mL of normal saline IV). The onset time of tourniquet pain was recorded. The level of sensory block was determined by the pinprick method at the occurrence of tourniquet pain. Hemodynamic changes and side effects of EM were also recorded. The onset time of tourniquet pain from both the epidural injection and the tourniquet inflation were significantly longer in the EM group (103 +/- 15 min and 80 +/- 15 min, respectively) compared with the IVM group (74 +/- 12 min and 50 +/- 12 min, respectively; P < 0.05) and the Control group (67 +/- 9 min and 45 +/- 9 min, respectively; P < 0.05). The level of sensory block at the onset of tourniquet pain and hemodynamic changes were not different among the three groups. Only two and three patients in the EM group complained of nausea/vomiting and pruritus, respectively. Respiratory depression was not observed in any patient. We conclude that epidural injection of the mixture of 2 mg of morphine and 2% lidocaine solution delayed the onset of tourniquet pain during epidural lidocaine anesthesia without significant morphine-related side effects.",

Each anesthesiologist was blinded to BIS values throughout surgery and the wake-up test. The BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were compared at: before starting the wake-up test, patient movement to command, and after the patient was reanesthetized. The anesthetic technique for Group 1 was small-dose isoflurane, nitrous oxide, fentanyl, and midazolam and for Group 2 was nitrous oxide, fentanyl, and midazolam. Controlled hypotension was used for all cases. At patient movement to command, the patients were told a specific color to remember (teal) and on the second postoperative day were interviewed for explicit recall of the color and other intraoperative events. A total of 37 wake-up tests were performed in 34 patients. There was a significant increase in both groups of BIS (P < 0.001), mean arterial blood pressure (P < 0.001), and heart rate (P < 0.01) at the time of purposeful patient movement followed by a significant decline in BIS after reintroduction of anesthesia (P < 0.01). No patient recalled intraoperative pain, one patient recalled the wake-up test but not the color, and five patients recalled the specified color. We conclude that BIS may be a useful clinical monitor for predicting patient movement to command during the intraoperative wake-up test, particularly when controlled hypotension is used and hemodynamic responses to emergence of anesthesia are blunted.",

P-gp potentially limits access to brain tissue of psychoactive substrates, but little is known about its specificity for antipsychotics. The objective of this study was to assess the affinity of some atypical antipsychotic drugs in vitro for P-gp as indicative of their potential as P-gp substrates in vivo. The activity of P-gp towards four atypical and two conventional antipsychotics and a proven substrate, verapamil, was examined by their P-gp ATPase activity, a putative measure of P-gp affinity. The Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to the data. The rank order of the ratio V(max) / K(m) was: verapamil (2.6) > quetiapine (1.7) > risperidone (1.4) > olanzapine (0.8) > chlorpromzaine (0.7) > haloperidol (0.3) = clozapine (0.3). The atypical antipsychotics quetiapine and risperidone were relatively good P-gp substrates, although their affinities were not as high as verapamil. Olanzapine showed intermediate affinity and clozapine showed the least affinity of the drugs studied. These results suggest that P-gp is likely to influence the access to the brain of all of the atypical antipsychotics studied to various degrees.

The measure was developed specifically to assess patient-perceived cognitive effects of AED treatment. Evidence of its reliability and validity has been previously documented. In this study 96 patients were included using stratified inclusion-criteria to guarantee variability of performance: 55 patients were included from a 'low risk condition' with respect to possible cognitive effect (i.e. monotherapy carbamazepine within a dose range of 600-1200 mg/day) and 41 patients were included from a 'high risk condition' (i.e. polytherapy of three or two AEDs including either phenytoin, phenobarbitone or a benzodiazepine; treatment with topiramate with a titration speed using 50 mg or higher increments per week and within the first 6 months of treatment). All patients were prospectively assessed using the ABNAS and five neuropsychological tests (all part of the FePsy test system) with proven sensitivity of cognitive effects of antiepileptics: three tasks using reaction-time to measure speed ('simple (visual) reaction-time measurement', 'the binary choice reaction test' and 'the computerized visual searching task'); one test measuring motor speed ('the finger tapping task'); and a memory test ('recognition of words'). The three reaction-time tasks and the finger tapping test were significantly correlated with the ABNAS-score with correlations ranging from 0.22 to 0.35. The highest correlation was with 'simple (visual) reaction-time measurement' (0.35). Discriminant analysis showed that with the neuropsychological tests 61.5% of the patients were correctly identified as having high/low ABNAS-scores. The ABNAS underestimated impairment in 17.8% of the patients ( = low ABNAS-score but impairment on the neuropsychological tests). The present study contributes to the already existing evidence of validity of the ABNAS as a screening instrument for clinical practice as the relationship between the ABNAS-score and results of neuropsychological tests can help to identify who is at risk and needs further referral for neuropsychological assessment. Moreover the correlation between ABNAS-score and those neuropsychological tests that are sensitive for drug-effects may provide a sensitive instrument in early drug-development phases while keeping the burden on financial and time resources to a minimum.",

SSR180575 shows high affinity (IC(50), 2.5-3.5 nM) and selectivity for the rat and human PBR and potently inhibits the in vivo binding of [(3)H]alpidem to PBR in the rat brain and spleen after oral or i.p. administration (ID(50), 0.1-0.3 mg/kg). In an experimental model of motoneuron degeneration induced by facial nerve axotomy in the immature rat, SSR180575 given i.p. or orally for 8 days rescued facial motoneurons, increasing their survival by 40 to 72% at 6 and 10 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. Moreover, in this model, SSR180575 (10 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) increased by 87% the number of motoneurons immunoreactive to peripherin, a type III intermediate filament, whose expression is up-regulated during nerve regeneration. SSR180575 also improved functional recovery in acrylamide-induced neuropathy in the rat when given therapeutically at 2.5 to 10 mg/kg/day p.o. Furthermore, SSR180575 (3 mg/kg i.p. b.i.d.) accelerated functional recovery of the blink reflex after local injury of the facial nerve in the rat. SSR180575 increased pregnenolone accumulation in the brain and sciatic nerve (+100% at 3 mg/kg i.p.), suggesting that its neuroprotective effects are steroid-mediated.

It must be considered, however, that even the acute effects of drugs can be significantly altered by the context in which they are administered. The challenge is to determine the mechanisms operating to bring about these changes.", 
    "104": "Drug reinforcement plays a central role in drug abuse. Drugs of abuse are unconditioned reinforcers whose functional effects are mediated through neuropharmacological mechanisms. The role of conditioning has received attention, but the focus has been on associations between environmental cues and unconditioned drug stimuli. Recent studies by C.-E. Johanson, A. Mattox, and C. R. Schuster (1995) and S. M. Alessi, J. M. Roll, M. P. Reilly, and C.-E. Johanson (2002) have demonstrated that drugs can also acquire functional control over human behavior through conditioning processes. Given the potent effects that conditioned reinforcers (e.g., money) can have on human behavior, studies by Johanson et al. and Alessi et al. should engender further examination of conditioning processes and drug reinforcement.", 
    "105": "Despite reliance on a relatively small sample, the study by S. M. Alessi, J. M. Roll, M. P. Reilly, and C.-E. Johanson (2002) yielded remarkably consistent results, indicating that drug preference can be switched using conditioning procedures. However, because the study included only adults with limited drug involvement, the findings need to be interpreted taking the nature of the sample into account. This limitation points to opportunities for collaboration between experimental and epidemiologic researchers. Specifically, nesting experimental studies within longitudinal epidemiologic studies would reduce the potential for bias in sample selection while providing experimental data that are usually not available in observational epidemiologic research.", 
    "106": "The results presented in the article by S. M. Alessi, J. M. Roll, M. P. Reilly, and C.-E. Johanson (2002) suggest that the reinforcing impact of diazepam can change as a function of the participant's experience with the drug. The data fit nicely with a long tradition in learning theory that has shown that the effects of reinforcers can depend crucially on what the organism has been able to learn about them. Often, that learning reflects an associative process like the one involved in Pavlovian conditioning. The hypothesis that preference for diazepam increased in the Alessi et al. study because the drug was associated with money would benefit from additional experiments that include control conditions isolating the role of the Pavlovian drug-money contingency.", 
    "107": "This study examined whether preference for a drug (diazepam or placebo) could be switched using conditioning procedures. During the first 4 sessions of Phase 1, 6 participants received 5 mg of diazepam or placebo under double-blind conditions. During the remaining 5 sessions of Phase 1, participants selected the drug they wished to receive. The first 4 sessions of Phase 2 were a replication of Phase 1, except that following ingestion of the drug, participants completed a computer task for which they could earn money. Payment for the computer task was lowest following ingestion of the drug they preferred in Phase I and highest following the drug they had avoided. Preference was reassessed during the last 5 sessions of Phase 2. Five of the participants preferred placebo in Phase 1 but diazepam in Phase 2. Subjective responses to the drugs also changed across the 2 phases.", 
    "108": "Postoperative pain relief is a growing concern to an anaesthesiologist since no single analgesic is free from side-effects. Moreover, it becomes a challenge after caesarean section delivery to provide postoperative pain relief without much sedation, respiratory depression or problems like nausea, vomiting, so that early baby acceptance and care by mother is promoted. Antinociceptive effect of midazolam is well established by now and its safety is documented. This observation was made in a blind randomised study of 40 women of ASA I/II to evaluate postoperative pain relief using intrathecal midazolam in caesarean section delivery. Group A patients (n=20) received 1.5 ml of 5% lignocaine only and group B patients (n=20) received mixture of 1.5 ml 5% lignocaine with 2 mg midazolam (preservative free) through intrathecal route at L3.4 interspace; vital parameters were monitored intra-operatively and postoperatively and Apgar score of baby in 1st and 5th minute of deliverywas assessed. It was observed intrathecal midazolam produced highly significant (p<0.001) postoperative pain relief together with anti-emetic effect and tranquillity of patients of caesarean section delivery.", 
    "109": "In elderly insomniacs, melatonin treatment decreased sleep latency and increased sleep efficiency. This is particularly marked in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Melatonin is effective to reduce significantly benzodiazepine use. In addition, melatonin administration synchronizes the sleep-wake cycle in blind people and in individuals suffering from delayed sleep phase syndrome or jet lag. Urinary levels of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin decrease with age and in chronic diseases like AD or coronary heart disease. The effect of melatonin on sleep is probably the consequence of increasing sleep propensity (by inducing a fall in body temperature) and of a synchronizing effect on the circadian clock (chronobiotic effect).", 
    "110": "The aim of this study was to determine and compare patients' and physicians' perceptions of benefits and risks of long term benzodiazepine use for insomnia in the elderly.", 
    "111": "A cross-sectional study (written survey) was conducted in an academic primary care group practice in Toronto, Canada. The participants were 93 patients over 60 years of age using a benzodiazepine for insomnia and 25 physicians comprising sleep specialists, family physicians, and family medicine residents. The main outcome measure was perception of benefit and risk scores calculated from the mean of responses (on a Likert scale of 1 to 5) to various items on the survey.", 
    "112": "The mean perception of benefit score was significantly higher in patients than physicians (3.85 vs. 2.84, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.69, 1.32). The mean perception of risk score was significantly lower in patients than physicians (2.21 vs. 3.63, p < 0.001, 95% CI 1.07, 1.77).", 
    "113": "There is a significant discordance between older patients and their physicians regarding the perceptions of benefits and risks of using benzodiazepines for insomnia on a long term basis. The challenge is to openly discuss these perceptions in the context of the available evidence to make collaborative and informed decisions.", 
    "114": "There is little evidence on which to judge the optimal treatment for convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) in children. This study compares the effect of intravenous (iv) lorazepam with iv diazepam as the first line of treatment of CSE. We studied all children with prolonged seizures arriving in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department in two separate periods. In the first 6-month period iv diazepam was used as standard treatment, in the second 1-year period iv lorazepam was used. We measured latency to stopping of seizure and any adverse events. A successful treatment was defined as one in which the seizure clinically ceased within 15 minutes after siting the iv cannula, requiring no further treatment.Intravenous diazepam (0.32 mg kg (-1)) was used in 17 of 26 patients, whilst iv lorazepam (0.13 mg kg (-1)) was used in 31 of 59. There were no differences between the two groups regarding age, sex and seizure type.The seizure was successfully controlled 15 minutes after siting the iv cannula in 11 (65%) patients treated with diazepam (median time of 3 minutes) and in 20 (65%) patients treated with lorazepam (median time of 5 minutes). These preliminary results suggest that iv lorazepam may be as effective as iv diazepam.",

    "118": "Cats were trapped by their caretakers for a feral cat neutering program from July 1996 to August 2000. The anesthetic combination TKX was injected IM into cats while they remained in their traps. Each milliliter of TKX contained 50 mg of tiletamine, 50 mg of zolazepam, 80 mg of ketamine, and 20 mg of xylazine. Females were spayed by veterinarians, whereas males were castrated by veterinarians or veterinary students. Yohimbine (0.5 mg, IV) was administered at the end of the procedure. Logs were kept of the individual drug doses, signalment of the cats, and any complications encountered. These data were analyzed retrospectively (1996 to 1999) and prospectively (2000).", 
    "119": "Of the 5,766 cats for which dosing records were complete, 4,584 (79.5%) received a single dose of TKX. The mean initial dose of TKX was 0.24 +/- 0.04 ml/cat, and the total mean dose of TKX was 0.27 +/- 0.09 ml. Overall mortality rate was 0.35% (26/7,502) cats, and the death rate attributable solely to potential anesthetic deaths was 0.23% (17/7,502) cats.", 
    "120": "The use of TKX for large-scale feral cat neutering clinics has several benefits. The TKX combination is inexpensive, provides predictable results, can be administered quickly and easily in a small volume, and is associated with a low mortality rate in feral cats.", 
    "121": "Experimental models of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in Sprague-Dawley rats were established in this study. Diazepam was given to rats at a single oral dose of 30-40 mg.kg-1 and the plasma concentration of diazepam was detected by HPLC. The results showed that the plasma concentration of diazepam was significantly higher in hypothyroid rats than that in controls (P < 0.05). The Cmax, AUC and T1/2 (Ka) were increased. The Vd was decreased and the elimination was slowed. Mild hyperthyroidism showed nearly no effect on the plasma concentration, Cmax and AUC of diazepam in the rats. But when the rats became more heavily hyperthyroid, the plasma concentration, Cmax and AUC of diazepam were increased gradually. The absorption of diazepam was changed slightly in mild and moderate hyperthyroid rats, the Vd was decreased and the elimination was accelerated. In heavily hyperthyroid rats, however, the absorption of diazepam was obviously accelerated. The Vd was decreased and the elimination was slowed. Therefore, we conclude that different thyroid status may have different effects on the pharmacokinetics of diazepam.", 
    "122": "Typically, peripheral nerve block is done by approximating nerve location, usually by use of anatomical landmarks. Precise nerve location has been done by needle exploration. A new method, percutaneous electrode guidance (PEG) of the block needle, was performed. A transcutaneous stimulating cylindrical electrode was used to indent the skin, locate the underlying nerve, and guide a block needle near it.", 
    "123": "PEG was used to prelocate the desired nerve or neural plexus by use of a shielded cylindrical electrode with a 1-mm-diameter conductive area of skin contact at the distal end, the center of which contained a 22-gauge (1/2 mm) hole, which precisely matched a shielded conventional block needle. Transcutaneous stimulation began at less than 10 mA and was decreased to minimal amperage that elicited the desired motor response. Electrode position was fixed, and electrode current was discontinued. A shielded 22-gauge block needle was advanced through the electrode guide to near the underlying nerve. Initial needle current was only 0.5 mA. Local anesthetic was injected to block the targeted nerve or nerves. Standard sensory/motor testing was performed at 20 minutes.", 
    "124": "Nine upper or lower extremity blocks were performed on 7 patients. All were successful. Minimal stimulating currents were 1.3 to 8.2 mA for transcutaneous electrode stimulation and 0.20 to 0.70 for needle stimulation. Needle depth was 0.4 to 1.1 cm beyond the electrode tip and correlated with minimal electrode stimulating current.",

    "126": "Zolpidem is derived from imidazopiridine. In recent years it has been used as a non benzodiazepine hypnotic. It is a short acting inducer of sleep of similar efficacy to the benzodiazepines or zopiclone, but well tolerated and does not lead to drug abuse, rebound effects or abstinence syndromes. In this clinical note we wish to show that in spite of the descriptions in the medical literature, complications may follow long term use of zolpidem.", 
    "127": "We report the case of a 50 year old woman with no clinical history of interest apart from chronic insomnia and anxiety. She had been treated with zolpidem for the previous five years, at the usual dosage. However, since this seemed to be insufficient, the dose was progressively increased until in the months before she was seen by us she was taking a total of 450 mg per day in divided doses. She had drug tolerance, abuse and dependence. After a period of 12 hours without taking zolpidem she developed an abstinence syndrome, with generalized tonic clonic seizures and a prolonged post convulsion period which improved on symptomatic anticonvulsant treatment.", 
    "128": "In view of our case, and others described, we should be sceptical of the claim that zolpidem has no side effects, since it may give rise to tolerance, abuse and an abstinence syndrome. We consider that its indiscriminate use should be modified. Patients should be carefully followed up and medical prescription necessary to obtain zolpidem, as opposed to its current unrestricted availability.",

It is usually associated with the restless legs syndrome (it occurs in 80% of the patients with this syndrome) although PML may occasionally be an isolated finding. The prevalence of the disease is of 11%. It usually occurs in patients aged over 50 years, and the frequency increase with age. It is uncommon in persons aged under 30 years. In children it is almost unknown. When it does occur in this age group it is usually associated with the restless legs syndrome.",

    "131": "We report two cases of PML occurring in girls of under 7 years of age. They had severe associated neuropsychological disorders (disorders of behavior and feeding, psychotic episodes, etc.). The effect on performance at school led to complete failure in one case. We describe the clinical course of the two girls, emphasizing the variability, and both diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties.",

    "133": "The unstable elevated exposed plus maze (UEEPM) has been proposed as a novel model of anxiety which elicits unconditioned escape-related behaviour in rats thought to mimic the persistent \"fight/flight\" state exhibited by patients suffering from extreme anxiety disorders. This study investigated the predictive validity of the UEEPM by examining the behaviour of rats exposed to the test following administration of drugs known to induce panic and anxiety in panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder patients, namely m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), caffeine and yohimbine. The sensitivity of the UEEPM to two further putative anxiogenic agents, the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist FG 7142 and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), was also assessed.", 
    "134": "Male Hooded Lister rats received a single dose of mCPP (0.5-2.0 mg/kg; ip), caffeine (3.0-30.0 mg/kg; ip), yohimbine (1.25-5.0 mg/kg; ip), FG 7142 (3.0-30.0 mg/kg; ip) or PTZ (3.0-30.0 mg/kg; ip) before being exposed to the UEEPM for a period of 5 min. Subjects' behaviour was analysed to determine the effects of each compound on unconditioned escape.",

    "136": "The UEEPM is sensitive to the behavioural effects of anxiogenic agents. Furthermore, pharmacological similarities exist between symptoms of panic and anxiety in patients and escape from the UEEPM in rats. The UEEPM may therefore represent a paradigm to facilitate investigation into the neurochemical basis of extreme anxiety disorders.", 
    "137": "Serotonin (5-HT) and its receptors have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Altered serotonergic neurotransmission and interactions between 5-HT and dopamine (DA) systems may contribute to the pathophysiology of idiopathic psychotic or manic disorders. Interactions with 5-HT receptors may also contribute to special properties of modern antipsychotic drugs not yet evaluated for long-term effects on 5-HT receptors.", 
    "138": "We surveyed effects of newer atypical antipsychotics on 5-HT receptor types 1A, 2A, and 2C in rat forebrain regions by quantitative receptor autoradiography with selective radioligands following 28 days of continuous infusion of drugs or control vehicle.", 
    "139": "Infusion of olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine increased 1A, but decreased 2A receptor labeling in frontal cerebral cortex. Olanzapine decreased binding at 2C receptors in hippocampal CA(1) and CA(3) regions and perhaps entorhinal cortex; olanzapine, but neither risperidone nor quetiapine, also decreased 2C labeling in caudate-putamen.", 
    "140": "The findings suggest that altered 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A)receptor levels in frontal cortex, and 5-HT(2C) receptors in other forebrain regions, may contribute to psychopharmacological properties of these novel atypical antipsychotic agents, perhaps including their antipsychotic or antimanic actions, and low risk of adverse extrapyramidal effects.",

Enhanced sensitivity to PCP emerged in the male lesioned animals following a brief priming regimen with a D(1)-dopamine receptor agonist. Sensitization was also induced by repeated treatments with PCP (5 mg/kg), given at weekly intervals across 4 weeks, with progressive increases in activity significantly enhanced in the lesioned animals. Sensitization to PCP was still evident 3 weeks following chronic PCP treatment. The high rates of PCP-induced locomotion in the lesioned animals were not attenuated by pretreatment with a dopamine antagonist selective for the D(1)-dopamine receptor site (SCH-23390, 0.3 mg/kg) or with haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg), in comparison to controls. Olanzapine (5 mg/kg), an atypical antipsychotic, significantly reduced the response to PCP (5 mg/kg) in lesioned and control animals.",

    "147": "The four studies presented in this report sought to further validate the \"threat of shock\" paradigm as a human analogue to fear-potentiated startle in rats, by examining the effect of benzodiazepine administration on both baseline and fear-potentiated startle.", 
    "148": "Three studies, conducted at Utrecht University, evaluated the effects of oxazepam and of diazepam on baseline and fear-potentiated startle, whereas a fourth study, conducted at Yale University, evaluated the effect of diazepam on baseline, contextual and cue-specific fear-potentiated startle. The threat of shock paradigm consisted of verbal instruction about two visual cues (the threat cue predicted the possible administration of electric shock, the other predicted a safe period), followed by a series of presentations of these cues. During these conditions, acoustic startle stimuli were presented in order to elicit startle responses. The magnitude of the startle response was used to index the degree of fear or alarm experienced during the periods of threat and safety. The fourth study examined the effect of IV administration of diazepam in a similar threat of shock paradigm except that there were two additional context manipulations: electrode placement and darkness.", 
    "149": "None of the drug manipulations affected specific threat-cue potentiation of startle. However, reductions in baseline startle were observed. Further, startle potentiation by darkness was inhibited by diazepam.", 
    "150": "At least one type of fear-potentiated startle, i.e. potentiation by a cue-specific fear manipulation, is not susceptible to benzodiazepine treatment. In contrast, effects of manipulations more akin to anxiety (darkness, context) appear sensitive to benzodiazepines. Human experimental models differentiating between these cue specific and contextual responses are needed to shed more light on differences in the anatomy and pharmacology of anxiety disorders.", 
    "151": "Zopiclone is a benzodiazepine-like hypnotic that was believed not to have any abuse potential. Nevertheless, during the past few years there have been an increasing number of reports on the abuse and misuse of zopiclone. Despite this, methods for screening analysis in urine are lacking. To investigate whether UV detection would be possible to use for this purpose, a liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet detection for analyzing zopiclone and its urinary metabolites was developed, with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for confirmation. The method was used for analyzing samples from subjects receiving methadone. The limits of detection were approximately 100 ng/mL in control urine samples and 500 ng/mL in urine samples from subjects receiving methadone. However, due to the high background in these patients' urine, a single therapeutic dose was impossible to detect.", 
    "152": "To examine the involvement of cytochrome P450 3A4 in the metabolism of estazolam, the effect of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of this enzyme, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of estazolam was studied in a double-blind randomized crossover manner. Ten healthy male volunteers received itraconazole 100 mg/day or placebo orally for 7 days, and on the 4th day they received a single oral 4-mg dose of estazolam. Blood samplings and evaluation of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale, and Stanford Sleepiness Scale were conducted up to 72 hours after estazolam dosing. There was no significant difference between the placebo and itraconazole phases for the peak plasma concentration, apparent oral clearance, and elimination half-life. Similarly, none of the psychomotor function parameters was significantly different between the two phases. The current study showed no significant effect of itraconazole on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of estazolam, suggesting that cytochrome P450 3A4 is not involved in the metabolism of estazolam to a major extent.", 
    "153": "Increased levels of brain ammonia occur in both congenital and acquired hyperammonemic syndromes including hepatic encephalopathy, fulminant hepatic failure, Reye's syndrome and congenital urea cycle disorders. In addition to its effect on neurotransmission and energy metabolism, ammonia modulates the expression of various genes including the astrocytic \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine (or omega 3) receptor (PTBR). Increased expression of the isoquinoline carboxamide binding protein (IBP), one of the components of the PTBR complex, is observed in brain and peripheral tissues following chronic liver failure as well as in cultured astrocytes exposed to ammonia. Increased densities of binding sites for the PTBR ligand [3H]-PK11195 are also observed in these conditions as well as in brains of animals with acute liver failure, congenital urea cycle disorders and in patients who died in hepatic coma. The precise role of PTBR in brain function has not yet fully elucidated, but among other functions, PTBR mediates the transport of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane and thus plays a key role in the biosynthesis of neurosteroids some of which modulate major neurotransmitter systems such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) and glutamate (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)) receptors. Activation of PTBR in chronic and acute hyperammonemia results in increased synthesis of neurosteroids which could lead to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS. Preliminary reports suggest that positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [11C]-PK11195 may be useful for the assessment of the neurological consequences of chronic liver failure.",

Patients were randomized into 2 groups: (1) 56 were treated with oxazepam in response to the development of signs of alcohol withdrawal (symptom-triggered); and (2) 61 were treated with oxazepam every 6 hours with additional doses as needed (fixed-schedule). The administration of oxazepam in group 1 and additional oxazepam in group 2 was determined using a standardized measure of alcohol withdrawal. The main outcome measures were the total amount and duration of treatment with oxazepam, the incidence of complications, and the comfort level.", 
    "156": "A total of 22 patients (39%) in the symptom-triggered group were treated with oxazepam vs 100% in the fixed-schedule group (P<.001). The mean oxazepam dose administered in the symptom-triggered group was 37.5 mg compared with 231.4 mg in the fixed-schedule group (P<.001). The mean duration of oxazepam treatment was 20.0 hours in the symptom-triggered group vs 62.7 hours in the fixed-schedule group (P<.001). Withdrawal complications were limited to a single episode of seizures in the symptom-triggered group. There were no differences in the measures of comfort between the 2 groups.",

    "158": "The influence of nitric oxide (NO) on antinociceptive activity of diazepam (DZ), chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and clonazepam (CZ) was examined using the writhing test in mice. The effect of DZ was also studied in mice using hot plate and tail flick tests. DZ (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg), CDP (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and CZ (0.075, 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) produced significant, dose-dependent (DZ, CDP) antinociception in mice. The benzodiazepines (BZs)-induced antinociception was antagonized by flumazenil (5 mg/kg) and was not changed by naloxone (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg), except that of CZ, which was reversed by 5 mg/kg of naloxone. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) as well as 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) intensified antinociceptive activity of BZs. The antinociceptive effect resulting from co-administration of L-NAME with CZ and 7-NI with CDP was reversed by L-arginine. Methylene blue (MB) increased, whereas L-arginine (but not D-arginine) decreased antinociceptive effects of the studied BZs. These results suggest that the NO-cGMP pathway is involved in the mechanism of BZs-induced antinociception in the writhing test in mice.",

Included for analysis were patients at least 18 years old with baseline weights obtained within 3 weeks of drug initiation, and baseline fasting triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose obtained within 3 months prior to drug initiation and at 1 year of treatment (+/- 4 weeks). The patients meeting these criteria in each drug cohort (risperidone, N = 47; olanzapine, N = 47) included 1 patient with diagnosed diabetes mellitus prior to onset of treatment.",

Patients under 60 years of age with concurrent use of lithium or valproate were associated with greater weight gain in both drug groups, but this difference was statistically significant only for the olanzapine cohort. Neither weight change nor use of lithium or valproate was associated with increases in glucose or lipids among those under 60 years old for either drug.",

Scores of PANSS, AIMS, and SAS at the endpoint were also significantly decreased (p < .01) compared to those of baseline. Patients experienced improvements in menstrual functioning and perceptions of sexual side effects.", 
    "166": "Olanzapine reversed hyperprolactinemia in risperidone-treated female schizophrenic patients. This was associated with a decrease in amenorrhea, improved cycle regularity, and a decrease in sexual side effects that the women attributed to antipsychotic medication. This study suggests that switching to olanzapine is a safe and effective alternative method for patients with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia associated sexual and/or reproductive dysfunction. Long-term follow-up studies are warranted, with particular attention to the course of sexual and reproductive dysfunction.", 
    "167": "We report a clinical trial of olanzapine in the treatment of prominent apathy in the absence of depression in patients on long-term treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for nonpsychotic major depression.", 
    "168": "Participants were 21 men and women who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder in full remission (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score < or = 12) who had been taking an SSRI for at least 3 months. Data are presented (last observation carried forward) based on 20 enrolled participants who completed at least 1 follow-up visit. Participants had significant symptoms of apathy, defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score > or = 3, an Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) score > 30, and a MADRS item 8 (inability to feel) score > or = 2. Participants with a personal or family history of psychosis were excluded. Olanzapine was titrated in 2.5-mg increments at weekly intervals, until CGI-S score improved > or = 2 points from baseline or > or = 1 point with dose-limiting side effects, and participants continued in the protocol for 8 weeks at a stable dose following this improvement.",

    "172": "An analysis of medication use data is presented from two nationally representative surveys of the general population focusing on children 18 years of age and younger who used one or more prescribed psychotropic medication during the survey years. Rates of stimulant, antidepressant, and other psychotropic medication use are reported.", 
    "173": "The overall annual rate of psychotropic medication use by children increased from 1.4 per 100 persons in 1987 to 3.9 in 1996 (p < .0001). Significant increases were found in the rate of stimulant use (0.6 per 100 persons to 2.4 per 100 persons), antidepressant use (0.3 per 100 persons to 1.0 per 100 persons), other psychotropic medications (0.6 per 100 persons to 1.2 per 100 persons), and coprescription of different classes of psychotropic medications (0.03 per 100 persons to 0.23 per 100 persons), especially antidepressants and stimulants. Rates of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine use remained stable. In 1996, stimulant use was especially common in children aged 6 to 14 years (4.1 per 100), and antidepressant use was common in children aged 15 to 18 years (2.1 per 100 persons).",

    "175": "Propofol has certain advantages over benzodiazepines plus narcotics as sedation for endoscopy. In a few centers, propofol has reportedly been used in endoscopic procedures and administered by nurses supervised by gastroenterologists without attendance by anesthesiologists or nurse anesthetists.", 
    "176": "As part of our continuous quality improvement program, we prospectively recorded the doses of propofol and adverse reactions to the drug in our initial 2000 cases. In all cases propofol was administered by nurses who were supervised by gastroenterologists, with no involvement by an anesthesia specialist.", 
    "177": "The 2000 cases included 2222 procedures. There were five episodes of oxygen desaturation to <85%, four of which seemed to be related to excessive administration of propofol and were treated by brief (< 1 min) periods of mask ventilation. No patient required endotracheal intubation or hospital admission, or suffered long-term sequelae from propofol administration. There were no perforations in 977 colonoscopies.", 
    "178": "Propofol can be given safely by appropriately trained nurses under supervision by endoscopists. Technology that allows immediate detection of apnea would likely further improve its safety.",

    "180": "A prospective, randomised, controlled, crossover trial.", 
    "181": "A total of 26 children aged 10-16 (ASA I), referred for orthodontic extraction of premolar or canine teeth under sedation, were included in the study. Each child required two treatment sessions for the extraction of equivalent teeth on opposite sides of the mouth. Each subject was sedated with either ora midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) or nitrous oxide and oxygen (30%/70%) at the first visit and the alternative form at the second visit. At each visit two teeth were extracted, one upper and one lower. Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, respiration rate, sedation and behavioural scores were recorded every five minutes. Overall behaviour, patient acceptance and patient satisfaction were recorded at the end of treatment.", 
    "182": "Of the 26 children included in the study there were 12 males and 14 females. The mean age was 12.5 years. The mean heart rate and respiratory rate for both groups were similar and within acceptable clinical limits. The lowest mean arterial oxygen saturation levels for nitrous oxide and midazolam sedation were 97.7% and 95.0% respectively. Although midazolam caused greater oxygen desaturation, the range (91%-100%) was within safe limits for conscious sedation. The mean level of sedation was greater in the midazolam group compared with the nitrous oxide group and all but one case completed treatment. A total of 23 patients (88%) said they would be prepared to have ora midazolam sedation again and 17 (65%) actually preferred oral midazolam to nitrous oxide sedation.",

    "184": "Oxazepam (OX) is one of the number benzodiazepines used therapeutically as a sedative-hypnotic and anti-anxiety agent. OX is also a common metabolite of many other benzodiazepines. Since they are among the most widely prescribed drug, the evaluation of their potential genotoxic activity should be considered very important. In the present study cytochalasin B-blocked binucleate human lymphocytes have been used to measure micronucleus induction after treatment with oxazepam. The frequency of micronuclei (MN) were analysed in 72 hours culture of peripheral blood human lymphocytes. OX was added to the cultures at the beginning of the cultivation period. The concentrations in cultures was 0.5; 5; 10; 25 and 50 mg/ml. It was found that all used oxazepam concentrations induced formation of micronuclei. MN frequencies were significantly increased (except for concentration 0.5 mg/ml OX) in relation to the control (cultures without OX). Number of binuclear lymphocytes with micronuclei, as well as number of micronuclei per a binuclear lymphocytes stand in correlation with the strength of tested concentrations--there was a dose-response. On the basis of our results we can conclude that long time administrated of OX may represent a potential hazard to human health.", 
    "185": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of antipsychotic agents. It generally is characterized by fever, altered mental status, rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction. A 53-year-old man developed NMS without rigidity while taking olanzapine. Such atypical cases may support either a spectrum concept of NMS or the theory that NMS secondary to atypical antipsychotics differs from that caused by conventional neuroleptics. More flexible diagnostic criteria than currently mandated by the the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Revision, may be warranted.",

    "187": "To estimate and examine the incidence and determinants of initiation of migraine-prophylactic therapy as well as the corresponding drug of choice over a period of 5 years following the use of specific abortive migraine drugs.", 
    "188": "By accessing data from a large prescription database, an identification of patients treated with ergotamine or a triptan from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1998 was made. The cumulative incidence of initiation of migraine-prophylactic drugs (beta-blockers, serotonin antagonists, specific calcium antagonists, amitriptyline, clonidine and valproic acid) was estimated in patients following the use of ergotamine or a triptan. An assessment of the migraine-prophylactic drug of first choice was also performed. A few baseline determinants were analysed to highlight a possible association with the initiation of prophylactic therapy: age, gender, type of abortive migraine drug use and year of prophylaxis. Additional determinants included the analysis of drug-utilisation patterns, such as the consumption and switch patterns of abortive migraine drug use as well as co-medication use prior to prophylaxis. For this particular analysis a reference group (patients not having commenced prophylaxis) was selected from the initial study population.", 
    "189": "After having satisfied eligibility criteria, a total of 3999 first-time users of ergotamine and triptans were included of whom 479 (12%) had initiated migraine-prophylactic therapy. This corresponded to an incidence density of 6.0 per 100 person-years and was highest for patients younger than 45 years and for multiple abortive migraine drug users. The incidence fell considerably from 12.0 person-years in 1994 to 5.1 person-years in 1998. More than half of the patients had been prescribed a beta-blocker as the migraine-prophylactic drug of first choice by both general practitioners and neurologists. The use of antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines and oral contraceptives was significantly higher in patients starting prophylaxis compared with those who did not. The consumption of abortive migraine drug use (4.0 defined daily doses per month vs 3.7 defined daily doses per month), and switch patterns (27.1% vs 30.9%) were similar for patients starting and not starting prophylaxis.", 
    "190": "The overall incidence of initiation of migraine-prophylactic therapy following the use of abortive migraine analgesics was 6.0% per year and fell considerably during 5 years of the study. Beta-blockers were the migraine-prophylactic drugs of first choice for general practitioners and neurologists. In our study we could not determine any factors clearly associated with the initiation of migraine prophylaxis besides prior use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines. A future assessment of the usage patterns of migraine-prophylactic drugs may provide detailed information concerning the effectiveness and tolerability.", 
    "191": "The teratogenicity of cigarette smoke has been widely researched over the past two decades, in large part due to the work of Fried et al. The current study was designed to investigate some methodological issues surrounding the investigation of the effects of maternal smoking along with other potentially teratogenic agents in pregnancy. Specifically, maternal smoking was investigated both as a covariate and with regards to its main and interactive effects on child IQ in a prospectively ascertained sample of children whose mothers reported pregnancy exposures to four classes of agents: varicella virus infection (VC), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and benzodiazepines (BZDs). Children were also included whose mothers were not exposed to one of these four agents during pregnancy. The goal of this study was not to examine the behavioral teratogenic potential of these agents or of maternal smoking. Rather, our goal was to illustrate some methodological issues in addressing the combined effects of these agents in behavioral teratology. In the analyses of all four exposures, when smoking was considered as a covariate, it was either a significant or marginally significant covariate and the exposure of interest was not significantly related to a change in IQ score. However, when maternal smoking was considered as a factor in the analyses, four different patterns emerged illustrating the potential importance of properly addressing maternal smoking in the analysis of other potential behavioral teratogens.", 
    "192": "Solubility enhancement of the water insoluble bromazepam was studied during the formation of its inclusion complexes with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and beta-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (beta-HP-CD). The phase solubility technique established by Higuchi and Connors and UV-spectrophotometric methods (zero- and second-order derivative approaches) were used to measure the changes introduced in this chemical system. The amount of time, which was necessary to reach equilibrium between inclusion complexes and their free components, was estimated and found equal to 24 h. The study was carried out at (i) pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C and (ii) pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. The solubility of bromazepam increased linearly as a function of concentration for both beta-and beta-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrins. Thus, the phase solubility diagrams were classified as of A(L) type in all cases. Under the above-mentioned conditions, the formation constants of the inclusion complexes were calculated and their stoichiometry was evaluated, found in the range of 69-85 M(-1) and 1:1, respectively.", 
    "193": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of devazepide, a CCK(1) receptor antagonist, was investigated on food intake in rats. In the first experiment, rats (n=5) were deprived of food for 17 h and injected intracerebroventricularly with either vehicle or devazepide (1, 10, 25 or 100 ng). Five minutes after vehicle or drug administration, the animals were presented with food and intake measured for 60 min. Devazepide produced a dose-related increase in food intake. Doses of 1, 10 and 25 ng significantly increased consumption (at least P<0.01 in each case). A second experiment was subsequently undertaken to investigate whether systemic administration of the intracerebroventricular doses used in the first experiment would affect food intake. Rats (n=8) that have been deprived of food for 17 h were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle or devazepide (3, 30, 75 or 300 ng/kg). Five minutes after vehicle or drug administration, the animals were presented with food and intake was measured for 60 min. Devazepide (3-300 ng/kg, i.p.) had no significant effects on food consumption. The results show that central administration of low doses of devazepide increase food intake in rats, while similar doses, given systemically, do not affect consumption. These findings suggest the possibility that endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK), acting at central CCK(1) receptors, may play a physiological role in the control of feeding behaviour in the rat.", 
    "194": "A sensitive and specific liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) method has been validated for the measurement of YF476 in human plasma. The method involves a simple liquid-liquid extraction procedure, chromatography of the extracts on a C(18) column, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation and detection in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The calibration line was linear over the concentration range 0.1 ng/ml (the limit of quantification) to 25.0 ng/ml. Intra- and inter-batch precision was <14% and intra- and inter-batch accuracy was <11% over the entire calibration range. The bioanalytical method is robust and has been used for the analysis of many samples from human subjects involved in early clinical studies (Phase I).", 
    "195": "The preservation of the neuronal circuitry in rat cerebellar slice cultures provides an advantage in monitoring the development and characterizing the pharmacology of GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Sprague-Dawley rats, 8-11 days of age, were decapitated, their cerebella were cut into 400-microm slices and transferred into culture dishes. Cell viability and organotypic cerebellar organization of the culture remained well preserved up to 3 weeks. Autoradiographic procedures were introduced in these advanced culture technique and employed [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 in the absence and presence of 10 microM diazepam to visualize all benzodiazepine (BZD) and diazepam-insensitive (DIS) binding sites, respectively. Since expression of the alpha6 subunit variant of the GABA(A)/BZD receptor is restricted to the cerebellar granule cells and the BZD receptor agonist diazepam has very low affinity for this subunit, changes in DIS [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites during cultivation time can be attributed to changes in alpha6 subunit expression. A time-dependent development of total and DIS [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites were observed in the culture with a trend towards an increase in GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit levels during the first week. These findings suggest that explant preparations can be used to examine morphological changes in rat cerebellar slices. In addition, these preparations can be utilized to study the pharmacological effects of GABA(A)/BZD selective drugs on postnatal development of GABA(A) receptors in rat cerebellum.", 
    "196": "There is current disagreement over whether men and women respond differently to typical or atypical antipsychotic medications. This study reanalyzed a large international clinical trial of olanzapine (Olz) compared with haloperidol (Hal) to test for sex differences in treatment response, controlling for illness chronicity and menopausal status. We hypothesized that women would show a greater response to either medication than men, particularly among first admission, premenopausal women. DSM-III-R schizophrenia inpatients (700 women and 1295 men) were randomly assigned to a 6-week trial of Olz vs. Hal. Longitudinal random effect models were used to test for interactions of sex with medication, chronicity and menopausal status on treatment response. Findings showed that women on olanzapine had a greater drop in overall symptomatology by week 4 than any other group, and their level of symptomatology remained lower throughout the 6-week trial. The sex differences in treatment response in olanzapine compared with haloperidol were, in part, dependent on chronicity and, in women, menopausal status. That is, first episode women on haloperidol exhibited an increase in symptomatology over the 6-week trial compared to their male counterparts, while multiply hospitalized women had a better treatment response on haloperidol than their male counterparts. Women on olanzapine had a significantly better treatment response than men, regardless of chronicity. Finally, premenopausal women had a significantly better treatment response than postmenopausal women, regardless of treatment and chronicity."
