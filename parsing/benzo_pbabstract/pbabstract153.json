In general, neurodegenerative diseases have unpredictable clinical courses and timely effective treatment is not available. For effective clinical trials on new drugs, suitable surrogate markers to monitor disease progression are required. The extent of cerebral inflammation could be such a surrogate marker. Nuclear imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), have been applied to monitor inflammatory processes in patients. Neuroinflammation is accompanied by a variety of physiological changes, such as changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and perfusion, cyclooxygenase-2 overexpression and microglia activation. Nuclear imaging has utilized these physiological changes to visualize the inflammatory process in various chronic or acute neurodegenerative diseases. Expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in activated microglia proved a suitable specific marker to detect neuroinflammation. Currently, radiolabeled COX-2 inhibitors are under investigation for this purpose. The causative of neuroinflammation is often unknown, but the herpes simplex virus (HSV), for example, has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, antiviral agents and antibiotics have been prepared that might be applicable to discriminate specific viral or bacterial infections. These radiolabeled compounds could also be used to monitor the drug pharmacokinetics noninvasively with PET. This review summarizes the progress that has been made in nuclear imaging of neuroinflammation in,neuropsychiatric diseases.", 
    "1": "A universal high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the simultaneous determination of seven frequently prescribed 1,4-benzodiazepines in bulk powder or formulated in tablets or capsules. Peak tailing commonly reported with HPLC method developed for benzodiazepines, is completely omitted with this new method. The assay procedure consisted of pulverization, extraction into methanol, filtering, diluting and injecting of aliquots of clear filtrate into a reversed phase column with a very low silanol activity. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of methanol and 0.05 mol x L(-1) buffer solution of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (50:50, v/v) adjusted to pH 5.8. The effluent was monitored by UV detection at 254 nm and delivered at a flow rate of 1.6 mL x min(-1). The new method has been applied for quantifying of 1,4-benzodiazepines in different commercial formulations with recoveries ranging from 99.0 (+/- 1.98) to 102.0 (+/- 1.58)%. The excipients present in tablets and capsules did not interfere with the developed method. The applicability of the method for content uniformity and dissolution tests has been also investigated and the results were considered satisfactory. The developed method is rapid and sensitive, and is suitable for routine control of pharmaceutical dosage forms.",

This study uses the updated Beers criteria for potentially inappropriate drug (PID) use in older adults to determine the extent and nature of PIDs in older nursing home residents in Helsinki, Finland. The study also uses the Swedish, Finnish, INteraction X-referencing (SFINX) interaction database to assess the possibility of clinically significant class D (\"clinically significant interaction, and the combination should be avoided\") drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in the same population.", 
    "3": "This study is a cross-sectional assessment of all nursing home residents aged > or = 65 years in Helsinki. The residents' demographic information and medical data were collected from medical charts in February 2003.", 
    "4": "Of all nursing home residents in Helsinki, 82% (n = 1987) were eligible for analysis. Their mean age was 83.7 (SD 7.7) years, 80.7% were female and 69.5% were diagnosed with dementia. The mean number of drugs given on a regular basis per resident was 7.9 (SD 3.6) per day. Of the study population, 34.9% regularly used at least one PID. Residents taking PIDs were more likely to be taking psychotropic medication and to be taking nine or more drugs daily, and less likely to have a diagnosis of dementia, than patients not taking PIDs. The three most prevalent PIDs were: (i) short-acting benzodiazepines in greater than recommended doses (13.9% of all residents), of which temazepam >15 mg/day was the most commonly used agent and, indeed, the most common PID (taken by 13.5% of all residents); (ii) hydroxyzine (7.1%); and (iii) nitrofurantoin (6.3%). Together, these three PIDs accounted for 76.9% of all PID use. Of all residents, 4.8% were susceptible to a clinically significant DDI. The most common potential DDIs were related to the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, carbamazepine and codeine. Compared with residents not exposed to potential DDIs, residents exposed to potential DDIs were more likely to be younger, to have a prior history of stroke, to be taking psychotropics, to be taking nine or more drugs daily and to be taking PIDs.", 
    "5": "Use of PIDs is very common among nursing home residents, and this increases the likelihood of DDIs. Monitoring patients for PID use and potential drug interactions could increase the quality of prescribing.", 
    "6": "The aim was to study the influence of patients' age, frequency and type of seizures, disease duration, number of AEDs and use of benzodiazepines on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy.", 
    "7": "We consecutively identified 223 patients with epilepsy who attended the epilepsy outpatient clinics at three university hospitals in Greece. Quality of life was evaluated by QOLIE-31. One-way analysis was used to assess the association of the studied factors and QOLIE-31 subscales. After checking for co-linearity, we performed multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis with all the variables that on univariate analysis showed a statistically significant effect on each subscale of QOLIE-31 to explore which of the studied factors affect independently on QOLIE-31 scores.", 
    "8": "Of a total of 223 patients, 118 (52.95%) were men; mean age was 35.18 +/- 13.22; mean duration of the disease was 13 years; 58 (26%) patients had generalized seizures, 93 (41.7%) had PS, and 72 (32.3%) of the patients had PsG; 85 (38.1%) were on polytherapy and 38 (17%) were taking benzodiazepines. Independent factors affecting QoL were: seizure frequency (Overall QoL P = 0.0001, Seizure worry and Emotional well-being P < 0.0001, Energy/fatigue and Social functioning P = 0.01); duration of the disease (Overall QoL and Energy/fatigue P = 0.01, Seizure worry P = 0.008, Cognitive functioning P < 0.0001); polytherapy only for the Emotional well-being P < 0.0001; and use of benzodiazepines (Overall QoL, Energy/fatigue, Social functioning P = 0.002, Cognitive functioning P < 0.0001).", 
    "9": "Our findings suggest that QoL in epileptic patients might be affected, in addition to the other established factors (high frequency of seizures and polytherapy), by the daily use of benzodiazepines as adjunctive therapy. Change of medical strategy concerning this medication may lead to improving the QoL of these patients.", 
    "10": "Anxiety is frequently observed in several neuropsychiatric disorders, and stress is thought to precipitate or exacerbate anxiety. In this study, the anxiolytic action of a herbal medicine, saikokaryukotsuboreito, (SRBT) was examined in normal healthy rats using the elevated plus-maze test. Moreover, the improving effect of SRBT on chronic stress-induced anxiety was also examined. Single administration of SRBT did not have anxiolytic action in normal rats. Repeated administration of SRBT significantly improved chronic stress-induced anxiety. On the other hand, single administration of a typical anxiolytic, diazepam, had anxiolytic action in normal rats but repeated administration did not improve chronic stress-induced anxiety. These results suggest that SRBT does not have anxiolytic activity equivalent to that of diazepam but has potency for improving stress-related anxiety. This finding provides information important for the treatment of anxiety.", 
    "11": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37 amino acid peptide which acts on central nervous system (CNS) neurons and is involved in activities related to dopamine. These effects of CGRP suggest that the peptide may have a role in pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia where dopaminergic system hypoactivity in the frontal cortex and hyperactivity in the subcortical structures have been demonstrated. In this study we measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) the brain levels of CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) in rats treated with either classical (haloperidol) or atypical (risperidone and olanzapine) antipsychotic drugs. Both haloperidol and risperidone decreased CGRP-LI in the striatum. Risperidone also decreased CGRP-LI in the occipital cortex. On the other hand, olanzapine increased CGRP-LI in the striatum, the frontal cortex and hypothalamus. The differential effects on CGRP could reflect a different profile of side effects and further suggest that CGRP is involved in CNS functions related to psychiatric disorders.",

Mean (95% confidence interval) of the pharmacokinetic parameters were: AUC(0,infinity) 596 (327, 865), 608 (353, 864) and 518 (294, 741) ng ml(-1) h; V(d) 0.85 l kg(-1); clearance 14.4 ml min(-1) kg(-1), elimination half-life 1.22 (0.65, 1.8) h, respectively. A single dose of MDZ terminated convulsions in all (100%), 9/12 (75%) and 5/8 (63%) children following IV, IM and buccal administration. Four children (one in the IV, one in the IM and two in the buccal groups) had respiratory depression.", 
    "15": "Administration of MDZ at the currently recommended dose resulted in rapid achievement of therapeutic MDZ concentrations. Although IM and buccal administration of MDZ may be more practical in peripheral healthcare facilities, the efficacy appears to be poorer at the dose used, and a different dosage regimen might improve the efficacy.",

The BIS was monitored until it began to fall steadily and remained below a value of 90; the elapsed time was recorded and the patient was taken to the theater. All patients underwent 6 routine maneuvers before induction. After surgery, patients were asked about their memory of the maneuvers performed. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were studied to obtain the BIS value that provided the best combination of sensitivity and specificity, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn.",

    "26": "Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha2 adrenoreceptor agonist that has been described as a useful, safe adjunct in many clinical applications. This paper reviews current clinical uses, mechanism of action, and side effects of dexmedetomidine. The current uses reviewed include sedation in the ICU (adult and pediatric), neurosurgery, pediatric procedural sedation, awake fiber-optic intubation, cardiac surgery, and bariatric surgery.", 
    "27": "Dexmedetomidine is a useful medication with many clinical applications. The medication has shown efficacy in decreasing the need for opioids, benzodiazepines, propofol, and other sedative medications. Short-term sedation has been shown to be safe in studies, although hypotension and bradycardia are the most significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine has been used effectively for sedation during pediatric procedures and in the ICU. In order to reduce sympathetic tone during cardiac surgery, a low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion has been utilized. The bariatric surgery population has also been studied with dexmedetomidine because of its adequate sedation and less prevalent respiratory depression when compared with opioid administration. Dexmedetomidine is emerging as an effective therapeutic agent in the management of a wide range of clinical conditions with an efficacious, safe profile.", 
    "28": "TASK two-pore-domain leak K(+) channels occur throughout the brain. However, TASK-1 and TASK-3 knockout (KO) mice have few neurological impairments and only mildly reduced sensitivities to inhalational anesthetics, contrasting with the anticipated functions and importance of these channels. TASK-1/-3 channel expression can compensate for the absence of GABA(A) receptors in GABA(A) alpha6 KO mice. To investigate the converse, we analyzed the behavior of TASK-1 and -3 KO mice after administering drugs with preferential efficacies at GABA(A) receptor subtypes: benzodiazepines (diazepam and flurazepam, active at alpha1betagamma2, alpha2betagamma2, alpha3betagamma2, and alpha5betagamma2 subtypes), zolpidem (alpha1betagamma2 subtype), propofol (beta2-3-containing receptors), gaboxadol (alpha4betadelta and alpha6betadelta subtypes), pregnanolone, and pentobarbital (many subtypes). TASK-1 KO mice showed increased motor impairment in rotarod and beam-walking tests after diazepam and flurazepam administration but not after zolpidem. They also showed prolonged loss of righting reflex induced by propofol and pentobarbital. Autoradiography indicated no change in GABA(A) receptor ligand binding levels. These altered behavioral responses to GABAergic drugs suggest functional up-regulation of alpha2beta2/3gamma2 and alpha3beta2/3gamma2 receptor subtypes in TASK-1 KO mice. In addition, female, but not male, TASK-1 KO mice were more sensitive to gaboxadol, suggesting an increased influence of alpha4betadelta or alpha6betadelta subtypes. The benzodiazepine sensitivity of TASK-3 KO mice was marginally increased. Our results underline that TASK-1 channels perform such key functions in the brain that compensation is needed for their absence. Furthermore, because inhalation anesthetics act partially through GABA(A) receptors, the up-regulation of GABA(A) receptor function in TASK-1 KO mice might mask TASK-1 channel's significance as a target for inhalation anesthetics.",

All patients received 0.5-1.0 mg/kg ketamine intravenously for the procedure. Pulse rate, blood pressure oxygen saturations and incidence of adverse events (clonic movements, hypersalivation, laryngospasm, recovery agitation and vomiting) were recorded for all patients.", 
    "31": "Adequate sedation was obtained in 91 of the 92 patients (98.9%) and successful completion of the procedure was achieved in 91 patients (98.9%). Adverse events occurred in 20 patients (21.7%). Four patients (7%) developed clonic movements, none of which required treatment. Twelve patients (13.0%) developed recovery agitation. In five cases the agitation was transient and required no treatment; the other seven patients were treated with intravenous midazolam. One of the patients who experienced recovery agitation also developed vomiting. Two other patients vomited, and one patient had vomiting and hypersalivation. One further patient developed hypersalivation. There were no reported episodes of laryngospasm.", 
    "32": "Ketamine is an effective agent for procedural sedation in the emergency department. There were no serious adverse events associated with its use, but there is a significant incidence of recovery agitation which may require treatment with a benzodiazepine.", 
    "33": "A series of triazolobenzothiadiazine-pyrrolobenzodiazepine conjugates linked through different alkane spacers have been prepared. These compounds have exhibited significant cytotoxicity against most of the cell lines examined. Compound 5a displays GI(50) values from 1.83 to 2.38 microM against seven human tumour cell lines, and is identified as a promising lead compound from this series. Their DNA thermal denaturation studies have also been carried out, and one of the compounds 5c elevates the DNA helix melting temperature of the CT-DNA by 2.6 degrees C after incubation for 36 h.", 
    "34": "The anticonvulsant effect of alpha,beta-epoxy-carvone (EC), a monoterpene monocyclic, was investigated in three animal models. EC at 300 or 400 mg/kg promoted protection of 75% and 87.5%, respectively, against convulsions induced chemically by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and it was efficient in prevents the tonic convulsions induced by maximal electroshock (MES) in doses of 200, 300 or 400 mg/kg, resulting in 25%, 25% and 100% of protection, respectively. This monoterpene was also capable to promote an increase of latency for development of convulsions induced by picrotoxin (PIC) at 300 or 400 mg/kg and presented a significant protection against convulsions at doses of 200, 300 or 400 mg/kg, resulting in 12.5%, 12.5% and 100% of protection, respectively. On the other hand, the anticonvulsant effect of EC, was not affected by pretreatment with flumazenil (FLU), a selective antagonist of benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) receptor. Additionally was observed that EC treatment reduced the levels of in vitro lipoperoxidation and decreased (21.2%) the amplitude of compound action potential after 30 min of incubation. The present results clearly indicate the ability of EC to modulate the anticonvulsant and antioxidant effects. However, our data suggests that the action mechanisms are not due a direct activation of the GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptors, but could be associated with the reduction of isolated nerve excitability, possibly involving a voltage-gated Na(+) channels blockade.", 
    "35": "Recent genetic and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that alpha(2)-containing GABA(A) receptors mediate the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, setting a new strategy in developing novel, non-sedative anxiolytic agents. In this study we show that stereoisomers of 3-acetoxy-4'-methoxyflavan are positive modulators of recombinant alpha(1,2,3,5)beta(2)gamma(2L) and alpha(1)beta(2) GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. GABA(C) receptors are insensitive to modulation by these compounds. In each case, the enhancement was evident at low micromolar concentrations and occurred independently of the classical high affinity benzodiazepine site, as it could not be blocked by the antagonist flumazenil. Importantly, the compound Fa131 was significantly more efficacious at enhancing GABA-induced currents (EC(5)) at alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2L) receptors compared to alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2L), alpha(3)beta(2)gamma(2L) and alpha(5)beta(2)gamma(2L) receptors (E(max)=21.0+/-1.7 times, compared to 8.5+/-0.7 times at alpha(1)-, 9.5+/-0.6 times at alpha(3)- and 5.2+/-0.4 times at alpha(5)-contaning GABA(A) receptors), suggesting a potential use as an anxiolytic. In mice, this agent (1-30mg/kg i.p.) induced anxiolytic-like action in two unconditioned models of anxiety: the elevated plus maze and the light/dark paradigms. No sedative or myorelaxant effects were detected using the hole board, actimeter and horizontal wire tests, and only weak barbiturate-potentiating effects on the loss of righting reflex test. Fa131 demonstrated improved segregation of anxiolytic and sedative doses when compared to the non-selective agonist diazepam. Finally, flavan derivatives highlight the potential of targeting non-benzodiazepine allosteric sites in the search for new anxioselective drugs.",

    "40": "Serum osmolality was measured every other day during lorazepam therapy, and the osmol gap (measured osmolality minus calculated osmolarity) was determined. A serum propylene glycol concentration was obtained when the osmol gap first exceeded 10. In phase 1, 35 patients were monitored for 186 patient-days. Ten patients (29%) developed an osmol gap greater than 10; only one (10%) of these patients had propylene glycol concentrations greater than 18 mg/dl. In phase 2, 14 patients received lorazepam at a median dose of 631 mg (interquartile range [IQR] 437-972 mg) over a median of 5.5 days (IQR 4-8.75 days). Nine patients (64%) had propylene glycol concentrations greater than 18 mg/dl; six (67%) of these nine developed transient acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, or both. The correlation between osmol gap and propylene glycol concentration was 0.44 (p=0.006). An osmol gap of 10 or greater had a likelihood ratio of 4.4 to predict a propylene glycol concentration greater than 18 mg/dl. An osmol gap of 12 or greater had a likelihood ratio of 2.7 to predict the development of possible propylene glycol clinical toxicity.", 
    "41": "Screening for propylene glycol toxicity with the osmol gap may be helpful for patients receiving intravenous lorazepam in doses of 1 mg/kg/day or higher. An osmol gap of 10 or greater was predictive of elevated propylene glycol concentrations, and values of 12 or greater were predictive of clinical changes suggestive of propylene glycol toxicity.",

The large number of various BZD in pharmaceutical distribution, with similar core structures, and individual metabolic profiles all contribute to a complicated and time-consuming analysis. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the performance of four commercially available immunoassay urine screening kits for use in a forensic urine analysis testing program. The four kits included the Roche Benzodiazepine Plus KIMS assay, Microgenics CEDIA Benzodiazepine assay, Microgenics CEDIA high sensitivity assay with beta-glucuronidase, and Microgenics DRI reagent ready Benzodiazepine assay. Each kit was evaluated for linearity, precision, accuracy, carryover, reagent specificity, and confirmation rates. BZD reagent specificity was compared by analysis of 55 structurally dissimilar compounds to BZD. Negative responses to all 55 compounds were elicited by all four reagent assays. Cross-reactivity for the assays was demonstrated by detecting 27 structurally similar BZD. In addition, greater than 10,000 randomly collected urine samples were screened at a 200 ng/mL cutoff for each assay. Positive samples were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a panel of 13 BZD confirmation standards. The Microgenics CEDIA high sensitivity assay demonstrated the highest positive screening rate as well as the highest confirmation rate of the four assays.", 
    "44": "Testing for drugs-of-abuse in urine is requested for multiple reasons, including legal and workplace policies. Two cases were studied in which there was a suspicion that the patients continued to abuse diazepam, because of repeatedly positive urine samples. In these cases, diazepam metabolites were measured in urine samples by gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The concentrations of diazepam metabolites were subsequently creatinine correlated. Very long elimination times were found in the described cases. None of them had in fact ingested diazepam again during the study period. By the use of pharmacogenetic typing, one of the subjects was found to have a slow metabolism for CYP2C9 as well as for CYP2C19. In the second case, there was a possible drug interaction between diazepam and zolpidem.", 
    "45": "The effects of citalopram, olanzapine and their combinations were studied in tests on outbred SHR male mice. The locomotor activity was determined in the open field, the antidepressant effects - in the tail suspension test, the anxiety-like behavior- in the light-dark transition test; in addition, the antidopaminergic effects of drugs and their combination were evaluated using the apomorphine-induced stereotypy. The results indicate that olanzapine inhibits locomotor activity in all behavioral tests, whereas citalopram alone has no significant effect and does not modify the action of olanzapine. An antagonistic interaction between drugs was revealed in tests for the specific antidepressant-like and antidopaminergic activity when citalopram/olanzapine combinations were used. No significant drug influence was observed on the anxiety-related mice behavior in the light/dark test.", 
    "46": "Tramadol as a centrally acting analgesic is extensively used in the management of moderate to severe pain. It slightly affects opioid receptors and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrin and serotonin in the CNS. There are reports about toxicity and abuse of tramadol. The objective of the present study was to evaluate epidemiology of intentional tramadol intoxications. All poisoning cases that admitted to Loghman-Hakim Hospital Poison Center from April to May 2007 were studied. A total of 114 cases (82 men and 32 women) of intentional tramadol intoxications with the median age of 23.66 +/- 6.87 years (range 16-54 years) were identified. Other illicit drugs were found to be used in combination with tramadol in some of the cases, which among them benzodiazepines were the most common. Tramadol overdose has been one of the most frequent causes of drug poisoning in the country in the recent years, especially in male young adults with history of substance abuse and mental disorders. Nausea, vomiting, Central Nervous System (CNS) depression, tachycardia, and seizure are the most common findings in this kind of poisoning. Cardiopulmonary arrest was found as the cause of death in cases who had ingested more than 5000 mg tramadol.", 
    "47": "Catastrophic epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia is often intractable to anticonvulsant treatment. Many of the medications used unsuccessfully in treating this disorder are thought to exert at least a portion of their action through enhancement of inhibitory GABA(A) neurotransmission. In the present study, GABA(A) receptor properties in resected brain tissue from four infants with infantile spasms and intractable epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia were measured to determine if this clinical resistance to pharmacologic treatment correlates with alterations in receptor function. Results from epileptic cortex were compared with those from autopsy control samples. To perform these studies, we utilized the technique of injection of brain cellular membrane preparations into the Xenopus oocyte, which results in the incorporation of human GABA(A) receptors in their native configuration into the oocyte plasma membrane. Two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology analysis was then performed to assess GABA(A) receptor pharmacologic properties. The intrinsic properties of affinity, reversal potential, current decay, and current rundown were unchanged in the epileptic infants. Current enhancement by benzodiazepines was also unaltered, as was the response to barbiturates. However, a significant decrease was found in the degree of GABA(A) current enhancement by neurosteroids in the epileptic infants, along with an increase in current inhibition by zinc. These findings may contribute to the mechanisms of intractability in catastrophic infantile epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia, and suggest alternative therapeutic approaches.", 
    "48": "An 83-year-old female patient was managed in intensive care unit postoperatively with artificial ventilation and propofol-based sedation. On the second postoperative day, we tried to remove an endotracheal tube. Naloxone was administered to the patient for reversing the sedative effect of fentanyl infused intraoperatively. Her consciousness level was improved; however, subsequent administration of flumazenil induced hypnosis. Benzodiazepine-like partial agonistic effect of flumazenil might have enhanced residual hypnotic effect of propofol. Administration of flumazenil to the patient infused with propofol should be done cautiously for awakening the patient from anesthesia.",

Additionally, both parabens were tested in vitro in the H295R steroidogenesis assay and in the T-screen assay, the later to test for their ability to act as thyroid hormone receptor agonist or antagonist. In the in utero exposure toxicity study, neither ethyl nor butyl paraben showed any treatment-related effects on testosterone production, anogenital distance, or testicular histopathology. However, butyl paraben caused a significant decrease in the mRNA expression level of estradiol receptor-beta in fetal ovaries, and also significantly decreased the mRNA expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in the adrenal glands. In vitro butyl paraben increased the proliferation of the GH3 cells in the T-Screen assay, thereby acting as a weak thyroid hormone receptor agonist. In the adrenal H295R steroidogenesis assay both ethyl and butyl paraben caused a significant increase in the progesterone formation. Overall, the results indicate that butyl paraben might have the ability to act as endocrine disruptor by interfering with the transport of cholesterol to the mitochondrion, thereby interfering with steroidogenesis, but also that the two tested parabens do not show clear endocrine disrupting capabilities in our short-term in vivo experiment.",

We have used a simple method involving studies of the effect of large inhibitors on the Hill coefficient to provide improved estimates of substrate stoichiometry from simple steady-state kinetics. Using a panel of eight inhibitors, we show that at least four molecules of the widely used CYP3A4 substrate 7-benzyloxyquinoline can bind simultaneously to the enzyme. Computational docking studies show that this is consistent with the recently reported crystal structures of the enzyme. In the case of midazolam, which shows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the inhibitor effects demonstrate that two molecules must bind simultaneously, consistent with earlier evidence, whereas for diltiazem, the experiments provide no evidence for the binding of more than one molecule. The consequences of this \"inhibitor-induced cooperativity\" for the prediction of pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions are discussed.",

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated the time to treatment discontinuation by the treatment group, Cox proportional hazards regression models identified the variables associated with treatment discontinuation (adjusted for baseline differences between treatment groups), and logistic regression models compared the tolerability profiles of the different treatment groups. Of the 931 patients analyzed, 31.9% discontinued the medication initiated at baseline during the 3-year follow-up. Olanzapine had the lowest rate of discontinuation (28.9%), followed by other atypical (34.0%), risperidone (36.2%) and typical antipsychotics (44.5%). Compared to olanzapine, risk of treatment discontinuation was higher with typical antipsychotics (hazard ratio [HR] 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11, 2.78) or risperidone (HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.02, 1.82). A higher baseline Clinical Global Impression (CGI) positive score was associated with a higher risk of treatment discontinuation (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.06, 1.30). Olanzapine was associated with a lower frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms than other antipsychotics, fewer prolactin-related adverse events than risperidone and other atypical antipsychotics, but greater weight gain than typicals and risperidone. For all analyses, comparison with the other atypical group is limited due to its small sample size (n=50). In conclusion, treatment effectiveness and tolerability varied among antipsychotic medications in previously untreated patients with schizophrenia.

    "81": "Aripiprazole is a first next-generation atypical antipsychotic drug with dopamine system stabilizing, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 5-HT1A receptor partial agonistic, and 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic properties. In the present study, we examined the effect of aripiprazole on marble-burying behavior, which has been considered an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and compared this with the effects of other atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and quetiapine. Aripiprazole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited marble-burying behavior without affecting the locomotor activity in mice. Conversely, olanzapine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) and quetiapine (100 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant suppression of locomotor activity and impairment of motor coordination at the dose that inhibited marble-burying behavior. On the other hand, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane (WAY100635, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) markedly antagonized the inhibition of marble-burying behavior by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 3 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective 5-HT1A/7 receptor agonist. By contrast, WAY100635 at the same dose had no effect on the inhibition of marble-burying behavior by aripiprazole (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Quinpirole, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, showed significant suppression of locomotor activity at the dose that inhibited marble-burying behavior. Conversely, L-741,626, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, at a dose of 10 mg/kg inhibited marble-burying behavior without affecting the locomotor activity. On the other hand, ketanserin, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, had no effect on the marble-burying behavior. These findings suggest that aripiprazole may be a useful drug for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and that aripiprazole inhibits the marble-burying behavior via 5-HT1A receptor-independent mechanisms.", 
    "82": "Classical benzodiazepines, for example diazepam, interact with alpha(x)beta(2)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors, x = 1, 2, 3, 5. Little is known about effects of alpha subunits on the structure of the binding pocket. We studied here the interaction of the covalently reacting diazepam analog 7-Isothiocyanato-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (NCS compound) with alpha(1)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2) and with receptors containing the homologous mutation, alpha(2)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2), alpha(3)H126Cbeta(2)gamma(2) and alpha(5)H105Cbeta(2)gamma(2). This comparison was extended to alpha(6)R100Cbeta(2)gamma(2) receptors as this mutation conveys to these receptors high affinity towards classical benzodiazepines. The interaction was studied at the ligand binding level and at the functional level using electrophysiological techniques. Results indicate that the geometry of alpha(6)R100Cbeta(2)gamma(2) enables best interaction with NCS compound, followed by alpha(3)H126Cbeta(2)gamma(2), alpha(1)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2) and alpha(2)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2), while alpha(5)H105Cbeta(2)gamma(2) receptors show little interaction. Our results allow conclusions about the relative apposition of alpha(1)H101 and homologous positions in alpha(2), alpha(3), alpha(5) and alpha(6) with the position occupied by -Cl in diazepam. During this study we found evidence for the presence of a novel site for benzodiazepines that prevents modulation of GABA(A) receptors via the classical benzodiazepine site. The novel site potentially contributes to the high degree of safety to some of these drugs. Our results indicate that this site may be located at the alpha/beta subunit interface pseudo-symmetrically to the site for classical benzodiazepines located at the alpha/gamma interface.", 
    "83": "Taste is unique among sensory systems in its innate association with mechanisms of reward and aversion in addition to its recognition of quality, e.g., sucrose is sweet and preferable, and quinine is bitter and aversive. Taste information is sent to the reward system and feeding center via the prefrontal cortices such as the mediodorsal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices in rodents and the orbitofrontal cortex in primates. The amygdala, which receives taste inputs, also influences reward and feeding. In terms of neuroactive substances, palatability is closely related to benzodiazepine derivatives and beta-endorphin, both of which facilitate consumption of food and fluid. The reward system contains the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum and finally sends information to the lateral hypothalamic area, the feeding center. The dopaminergic system originating from the ventral tegmental area mediates the motivation to consume palatable food. The actual ingestive behavior is promoted by the orexigenic neuropeptides from the hypothalamus. Even palatable food can become aversive and avoided as a consequence of a postingestional unpleasant experience such as malaise. The neural mechanisms of this conditioned taste aversion will also be elucidated.",

A structure-based molecular modeling approach based on template-based flexible docking simulation followed by 'Tabu clustering' was performed on a series of 46 TIBO derivatives considered as training set of HIV-1 NNRTIs. Four different templates of the highest active ligand (pIC(50) = 8.52) of the series were used. The results were reasonably satisfactory. A good correlation was observed between the biological activity and binding affinity of the compounds, which suggest that identified binding conformations of these inhibitors are reliable. Statistical modeling yielded satisfactory results (r(2) = 0.878). Our studies suggest that template-based docking followed by 'Tabu clustering' enhances the docking efficiency. Also, cross-validation with a test-set containing 16 compounds gave satisfactory results (r(2) = 0.836). Data mining of PubChem database yielded a total of 31 hits (25 novel TIBO like compounds, as well as, 6 novel scaffolds) with enhanced binding efficacy as hits.

    "86": "We present a case of massive overdose with the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine in a 34-year-old woman (body weight 65 kg). At admission, approximately 2 to 4 hours after ingestion of approximately 24 g of quetiapine, the patient was comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale score 5), requiring orotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit. Because of myoclonic jerks and generalized seizures, benzodiazepines were administered. In addition to transient mild hypotension after intubation, the main cardiovascular manifestation was sinus tachycardia. The QT interval was normal, and the QTc interval (Bazett's correction) was maximally prolonged to 620 ms. However, no malignant arrhythmias were observed. The patient recovered within 2 days but remained agitated and aggressive, for which she was transferred to the psychiatric clinic. The pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in such a large overdose could not be described by simple first-order kinetics. The initially observed rapid decline of the plasma concentrations of quetiapine could be simulated by first-order kinetics (half life = 4.1 hr) and can most probably be explained by rapid distribution into tissues. The final elimination of the drug from the body occurred after approximately 34 hours at much slower rate, most probably reflecting redistribution from tissues into blood and consecutive hepatic clearance of the drug.",

    "88": "Several novel antipsychotics activate serotonin 5-HT1A receptors as well as antagonising dopamine D2/3 receptors. Such a pharmacological profile is associated with a lowered liability to produce extrapyramidal side effects and enhanced efficacy in treating negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, 5-HT1A receptor agonists increase plasma corticosterone and many antipsychotics disturb the regulation of glucose. Here, we compared the influence on plasma glucose and corticosterone of acute treatments with 'new generation' antipsychotics which target dopamine D2/3 receptors and 5-HT1A receptors, with that of atypical antipsychotics, and with haloperidol. Olanzapine and clozapine, antipsychotics that are known to produce weight gain and diabetes in humans, both at 10 mg/kg p.o., substantially increased plasma glucose (from 0.8 to 1.7 g/l) at 1 h after administration, an effect that returned to control levels after 4 h. In comparison, F15063 (40 mg/kg p.o.) was without effect at any time point. Olanzapine and clozapine dose-dependently increased plasma glucose concentrations as did SLV313 and SSR181507. Haloperidol and risperidone had modest effects whereas aripiprazole, ziprasidone and bifeprunox, antipsychotics that are not associated with metabolic dysfunction in humans, and F15063 had little or no influence on plasma glucose. The same general pattern of response was found for plasma corticosterone levels. The present data provide the first comparative study of conventional, atypical and 'new generation' antipsychotics on glucose and corticosterone levels in rats. A variety of mechanisms likely underlie the hyperglycemia and corticosterone release observed with clozapine and olanzapine, whilst the balance of dopamine D2/3/5-HT1A interaction may contribute to the less favourable impact of SLV313 and SSR181507 compared with that of bifeprunox and F15063.",

Inhibition of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to recombinant GABA(A) receptors in transiently transfected HEK293 cells indicated that 6,3'-DNF exhibited the highest affinity for GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha1beta2gamma2 subunits and a 2-20 fold lower affinity for homologous receptors containing alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 subunits. Two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes indicated that 6,3'-DNF does not induce chloride flux in the absence of GABA, but exerts low efficacy inverse agonistic modulatory effects on GABA-elicited currents in the GABA(A) receptor subtypes alpha1beta2gamma2 and alpha5beta2gamma2. In the subtypes alpha2beta2gamma2, alpha3beta2gamma2, alpha4beta2gamma2, alpha6beta2gamma2 or alpha4beta2delta and alpha4beta3delta, 6,3'-DNF exerts either none or very low efficacy positive modulatory effects. In contrast, 100 nM Ro15-1788 exhibited weak to moderate partial agonistic effects on each receptor investigated. These data indicate that Ro15-1788 only can antagonize the weak inverse agonist effects of 6,3'-DNF on alpha1beta2gamma2 and alpha5beta2gamma2 receptors, but will enhance the weak agonistic effects on the other receptor subtypes investigated. The possible mechanism of the Ro15-1788 sensitive anxiolytic effect of 6,3'-DNF is discussed.",

In this study, the possible participation of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor and the nitric oxide-cyclic GMP (NO-cGMP) pathway was assessed utilizing the pain-induced functional impairment model in the rat (PIFIR). Nociception was induced by an intra-articular injection of 15% uric acid. Diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the dysfunction induced by uric acid. Flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA/benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, abolished the \"antinociceptive-like effect\" of diazepam (at 2 mg/kg). The \"antinociceptive-like effect\" of diazepam (at 2 mg/kg) was antagonized by the non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, Nomega-L-nitro-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 5 mg/kg, s.c.)

Methylene blue (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, also prevented the \"antinociceptive-like effect\" of diazepam (at 2 mg/kg).

Eleven patients (55%) had 17 remote cortical areas with decreased FMZ binding outside the lobe of seizure onset. Thirteen of those 16 (81%) of the 17 remote cortical regions that were covered by subdural EEG were around cortex showing rapid seizure spread on intracranial EEG. Remote FMZ PET abnormalities were associated with high seizure frequency and, when resected, showed gliosis in all six cases where material was available. Higher number of unresected cortical regions with decreased FMZ binding was associated with poorer surgical outcome.",

Both compounds showed high affinity for bovine and human CBR. In particular, compound 7 emerged as the most interesting compound, having a partial agonist profile in vitro while possessing useful activity in various animal models of anxiety. In accordance with its partial agonist profile, compound 7 was devoid of typical benzodiazepine side effects. The homology model of the GABA A receptor developed by Cromer et al. was used to assess the binding modes of ligands 6 and 7. From our docking results, the partial agonist activity elicited by compound 7 is likely to be due to the 3'-nitro substituent, which is in the appropriate position to interact with Thr193 of the gamma 2-subunit by means of a hydrogen bond.",

SL65.1498 is a new compound that acts in vitro as a full agonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) 2 and 3 receptor and as a partial agonist at the 1 and 5 receptor subtypes. It is thought that the compound could be anxiolytic by its activation at the alpha2 and alpha3 receptor subtypes, without causing unfavourable side effects, which are believed to be mediated by the alpha1 and alpha5 subtypes. This study was a double-blind, five-way cross-over study to investigate the effects of three doses of SL65.1498 in comparison with placebo and lorazepam 2 mg in healthy volunteers. The objective was to select a dose level (expected to be therapeutically active), free of any significant deleterious effect. Psychomotor and cognitive effects were measured using a validated battery of measurements, including eye movements, body sway, memory tests, reaction-time assessments, and visual analogue scales. The highest dose of SL65.1498 showed slight effects on saccadic peak velocity and smooth pursuit performance, although to a much lesser extent than lorazepam. In contrast to lorazepam, none of the SL65.1498 doses affected body sway, visual analogue scale alertness, attention, or memory tests. This study showed that the three doses of SL65.1498 were well tolerated and induced no impairments on memory, sedation, psychomotor, and cognitive functions.",

A Dental Anxiety Total score >12 (moderate-to-severe) without meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth edition) (DSM-IV) anxiety disorder criteria was required. Efficacy and safety, assessed 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 h postdose, included 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VAS-Anxiety; primary outcome), 100 mm VAS-Sedation and Time-to-Onset of Action Scale (TOAS), a patient-rated anti-anxiety drug-benefit scale (no [0] to full benefit [10]). Mixed model analysis found significantly greater VAS-A improvement slopes for pregabalin (t = -2.47; P = 0.014) and alprazolam (t = -2.39; P = 0.018). There was a significant improvement versus placebo in the TOAS from 2 h through endpoint in alprazolam patients and from 3 h onward in pregabalin patients. Pregabalin produced significantly greater increases in VAS-Sedation versus placebo from 2.5 h through 4 h (2 h onward for alprazolam). Notably, there was a higher correlation between TOAS and VAS-Sedation (r = +0.58) than VAS-Anxiety (r = -0.50) on Spearman's analysis. The majority of Adverse Effects (AEs) were mild, and the most frequent for pregabalin, alprazolam, and placebo, respectively, were fatigue (N = 7, 7, 3), dizziness (N = 6, 3, 3), attention disturbance (N = 3, 1, 0), somnolence (N = 3, 0, 0), feeling abnormal (N = 0, 2, 0) and balance disorder (N = 0, 2, 0). These results suggest that onset of clinically meaningful anxiolytic effect after single-dose pregabalin occurs within the first 3-4 h. Additional research is needed to determine whether anxiolytic effect occurs in generalized anxiety disorder populations by day 1 or within 3-4 h post-first dose.",

    "117": "Neonatal maternal separation (MS) in the rat increases the vulnerability to stressors later in life. In contrast, brief handling (H) in early life confers resilience to stressors in adulthood. Early life programming of stress reactivity may involve the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region which modulates various stress responses. Moreover, hemispheric specialization in mPFC may mediate adaptive coping responses to stress. In the present study, neuronal activity was examined simultaneously in left and right mPFC in adult rats previously subjected to MS, H or animal facility rearing (AFR). In vivo electrophysiology, under isoflurane anesthesia, was used to conduct acute recordings of unit and local field potential (LFP) activity in response to systemic administration of N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142), a benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist which mimics various stress responses. MS decreased basal unit activity selectively in right mPFC. Basal LFP activity was reduced with MS in left and right mPFC, compared to AFR and H, respectively. Hemispheric synchronization of basal LFP activity was also attenuated by MS at lower frequencies. FG-7142 elicited lateralized effects on mPFC activity with different early rearing conditions. Activity in left mPFC was greater with AFR and MS (AFR>MS), whereas activity was predominantly greater with H in right mPFC. Finally, compared to AFR, MS reduced and H enhanced hemispheric synchronization of LFP activity with FG-7142 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that functionally-relevant alterations in mPFC GABA transmission are programmed by the early rearing environment in a hemisphere-dependent manner. These findings may model the hemispheric specialization of mPFC function thought to mediate adaptive coping responses to stressors. They also suggest the possibility that early environmental programming of hemispheric functional coupling in mPFC is involved in conferring vulnerability or resilience to stressors later in life.",

Surprisingly, it was reported that mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists have antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activities in laboratory animal studies as well. The present study aimed to resolve this controversy by characterizing behavioral effects of a selective mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, LY-341495, in a variety of animal models sensitive to clinically used anxiolytic and antidepressant agents. In agreement with previous reports, LY-341495 (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced immobility in the mouse forced swim test. LY-341495 was also effective in the marble burying test in mice, although similar effects were observed after administration of various drugs including methamphetamine. Further, LY-341495 had no effects in the elevated plus maze and stress-induced hyperthermia tests in mice, as well as on punished drinking (Geller-Seifter's test) and differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) in rats. It is concluded that behavioral profile of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists as represented by LY-341495 is different from that of conventional anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs.",

    "131": "Dopamine-glutamate interactions in the striatum are critical for normal basal ganglia-mediated control of movement. Although regulation of glutamatergic transmission by dopamine is increasingly well understood, regulation of dopaminergic transmission by glutamate remains uncertain given the apparent absence of ionotropic glutamate receptors on dopaminergic axons in dorsal striatum. Indirect evidence suggests glutamatergic regulation of striatal dopamine release is mediated by a diffusible messenger, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), generated downstream from glutamatergic AMPA receptors (AMPARs). The mechanism of H2O2-dependent inhibition of dopamine release involves activation of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. However, the source of modulatory H2O2 is unknown. Here, we used whole cell recording, fluorescence imaging of H2O2, and voltammetric detection of evoked dopamine release in guinea pig striatal slices to examine contributions from medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the principal neurons of striatum, and dopamine axons to AMPAR-dependent H2O2 generation. Imaging studies of H2O2 generation in MSNs provide the first demonstration of AMPAR-dependent H2O2 generation in neurons in the complex brain-cell microenvironment of brain slices. Stimulation-induced increases in H2O2 in MSNs were prevented by GYKI-52466, an AMPAR antagonist, or catalase, an H2O2 metabolizing enzyme, but amplified by mercaptosuccinate (MCS), a glutathione peroxidase inhibitor. By contrast, dopamine release evoked by selective stimulation of dopamine axons was unaffected by GYKI-52466 or MCS, arguing against dopamine axons as a significant source of modulatory H2O2. Together, these findings suggest that glutamatergic regulation of dopamine release via AMPARs is mediated through retrograde signaling by diffusible H2O2 generated in striatal cells, including medium spiny neurons, rather than in dopamine axons.", 
    "132": "11C-(R)-PK11195 is a PET radiotracer for the quantification of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBSs). The PBBS is a consistent marker of activated microglia, and 11C-(R)-PK11195 has been used to image microglial activity in the diseased brain and in neoplasia. However, the PBBS is also expressed in the brain vasculature (endothelium and smooth muscles), and no evidence, to our knowledge, exists of a change in the vascular PBBS in pathologic brains or of such a change having an effect on the quantification of 11C-(R)-PK11195 binding. To investigate this issue, we have used a modified reference-tissue model (SRTMV) that accounts for tracer vascular activity both in reference and target tissues and applied it for the estimation of binding potential (BP) in a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).", 
    "133": "A total of 10 patients with AD and 10 age-matched healthy subjects who underwent a 11C-(R)-PK11195 scan were considered in the analysis. The time-activity curves of 11 regions of interest were extracted using the Hammersmith maximum probability atlas. BPs were first estimated using the standard simplified reference-tissue model (SRTM) with the reference tissue computed with a supervised selection algorithm. Subsequently, we applied an SRTMV that models PBBS vascular activity using an additional linear term for both target (VbT) and reference (VbR) regions accounting for vascular tracer activity (C(B)), whereas C(B) was extracted directly from the images. VbR was fixed to 5%, and R1, k2, BP, and VbT were estimated. PBBS density in the vasculature was also assessed by immunocytochemistry on a separate cohort of young and elderly controls and 3 AD postmortem brains.", 
    "134": "The inclusion of a vascular component in the SRTM increased BPs in all subjects, but the amount of the increase was different (about 11.9% in controls and 16.8% in patients with AD). In addition, average VbT values derived using the SRTMV were 4.22% for controls but only 2.87% in patients with AD. Immunochemistry showed reduced PBBS expression in AD due to vascular fibrosis.", 
    "135": "The reduction of VbT in AD can be interpreted as a consequence of 2 independent but concurring phenomena. The vascular fibrosis in the AD brain causes the well-documented decrease of the size of lumens and the reduction of blood volume. At the same time, the fibrotic process determines the loss of vascular PBBS, particularly in smooth muscles, as here documented by immunochemistry. The inclusion of the additional vascular component in the SRTM effectively models these 2 concurrent processes and amplifies the BP in AD more than in controls because of the decrease in tracer binding to the vasculature in the disease cohort.", 
    "136": "The evolution of military medical care to manage polytrauma, critically ill-wounded warriors from the greater war on terrorism has been accompanied by significant changes in the diagnosis, management, and modulation of acute and chronic trauma-related pain. A paradigm shift in pain management includes early treatment of pain at the point of injury and throughout the continuum of care with a combination of standard and novel therapeutic interventions. These concepts are important for all critical care providers because they translate to most critically ill patients, including those resulting from natural disasters. Previous authors have reported a high incidence of moderate to severe pain and poor analgesia in intensive care units associated with sleep disturbances, tachycardia, pulmonary complications, increased stress response with thromboembolic incidents, and immunosuppression, increased intensive care unit and hospital stays, and needless suffering. Although opioids have traditionally been the cornerstone of acute pain management, they have potential negative effects ranging from sedation, confusion, respiratory depression, nausea, ileus, constipation, tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia as well as potential for immunosuppression. Alternatively, multimodal therapy is increasingly recognized as a critical pain management approach, especially when combined with early nutrition and ambulation, designed to improve functional recovery and decrease chronic pain conditions.",

Sale of ephedrine- and ephedrine-alkaloid-containing products was prohibited by the Food and Drug Administration in February 2004 after research demonstrated an increased risk of arrhythmia, mortality and hypertension following use of products containing these sympathomimetics. Subsequently, nutritional supplement manufacturers have turned to other products to promote weight loss. The following paper reports a case study of a 28-year-old woman with no prior psychiatric history who was hospitalized secondary to an acute psychotic episode. The patient reported starting several weight-loss and nutritional sports supplements approximately one week prior to admission. The relationship between the onset of psychosis and the initiation of the dietary supplements strongly suggests a correlation exists. Heightened consumer education regarding the contents of dietary supplements, along with their potential for causing adverse effects when used alone or in combination with other medications, is warranted. Patients who choose to take dietary supplements should be encouraged to inform their health care providers about the supplements they are taking.", 
    "140": "Fast and slowly rising inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs, IPSCF and IPSCS) in neocortical Cajal-Retzius cells are observed. In this study, zolpidem, a benzodiazepine agonist that specifically modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) containing gamma2 subunit, was used to characterize GABAARs mediating IPSCF and IPSCS. One-hundred-nanomolar zolpidem prolonged IPSCS, increased evoked IPSCS (eIPSCS) amplitude, and decreased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of eIPSCS. Two micromolar zolpidem prolonged both IPSCF and IPSCS, increased miniature IPSCF and eIPSCF amplitudes, increased eIPSCS amplitude but not miniature IPSCS amplitude, decreased PPR of eIPSCS, but failed to affect PPR of eIPSCF. We conclude that IPSCF are mediated by alpha2/3-containing GABAARs, which are not saturated by synaptic GABA release, whereas IPSCS are mediated by alpha1-containing and alpha2/3-containing GABAARs, which are saturated by quantal GABA release.",

    "142": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in liver cirrhosis is a clinical manifestation of a low-grade cerebral oedema, which is exacerbated in response to ammonia and other precipitating factors. This low-grade cerebral oedema is accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen oxide species (ROS/RNOS), which trigger multiple protein and RNA modifications, thereby affecting brain function. The action of ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, benzodiazepines and hyponatraemia integrates at the level of astrocyte swelling and oxidative stress. This explains why heterogenous clinical conditions can precipitate HE episodes. Oxidised RNA species, which are formed in response to oxidative stress, also participate in local postsynaptic protein synthesis in neurons, which is required for memory formation. Although the functional consequences of RNA oxidation in this context remain to be established, these findings bear a potential biochemical explanation for the multiple alterations of neurotransmitter receptor systems and of synaptic plasticity. Such changes may in part also underlie the pathologically altered oscillatory networks in the brain of HE patients in vivo, as detected by magnetencephalography. These disturbances of oscillatory networks, which in part are triggered by hypothalamic structures, can explain the motor and cognitive deficits in patients with HE. Current therapeutic strategies aim at the elimination of precipitating factors. The potential of therapies targeting downstream pathophysiological events in HE has not yet been explored, but offers novel potential sites of therapeutic intervention.",

Despite having a number of medication options readily available, benzodiazepines (BZs) and antidepressants have achieved remission rates of only 35% after 8 weeks of acute treatment. In the development of new anxiolytics, particularly those that affect the gamma-aminobutyric acid system, it is essential to assess the new compound's potential to cause discontinuation symptoms after stopping the medication as part of both short- and long-term treatment. This report describes the development of the 20-item Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC), a smaller version of the original 35-item PWC, and examines its validity, internal consistency, test-retest and interrater reliability, and factor structure. The PWC scores, assessed at the peak of withdrawal severity, were selected from 143 of our patients for an orthogonal factor analysis. Our results suggest that the Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist is a simple and accurate method to assess anxiolytic discontinuation symptoms.",

Patients meeting criteria for antipsychotic treatment resistance were excluded. Dose-response relationship was assessed by linear regression analysis with log-transformed dose (independent variable) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (dependent variable). There were no significant dose group differences in patients completing the study (overall, 67.8%). All dose groups showed statistically significant improvement in PANSS total scores from baseline to end point without significant dose-response relationship (P = 0.295). Post hoc analysis of response showed significant interaction between baseline PANSS and dose (P = 0.023), indicating better response at higher doses for patients with higher baseline PANSS. There was a significant dose response for mean change in weight (P = 0.003) with significant difference between the 10- and 40-mg-dose groups (P = 0.002; 1.9 [10 mg/d], 2.3 [20 mg/d], and 3.0 kg [40 mg/d]). There was a significant dose response for change in prolactin (P < 0.001) with a significant difference between each group (-10.5 [10 mg/d], -1.7 [20 mg/d], and 4.9 ng/mL [40 mg/d]; P < or = 0.018). Over 8 weeks, non-treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder responded to all 3 doses of olanzapine, without a statistically significant dose-response relationship, suggesting that for many patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, particularly those who are mildly or moderately ill, 10 mg/d should be the initial dose of choice.",

Persons with osteoporotic fractures (vertebral, wrist, or hip [n = 15,792]) were compared with controls (3 controls for each case matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidity [n = 47,289]). Medications examined included antidepressants (SSRIs vs other monoamines), antipsychotics, lithium, and benzodiazepines.", 
    "147": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with the highest adjusted odds of osteoporotic fractures (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.59). Other monoamine antidepressants (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.24) and benzodiazepines (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.16) were also associated with greater fracture risk, although the relationship was weaker. Lithium was associated with lower fracture risk (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.93), whereas the relationship with antipsychotics was not significant in the models that adjusted for diagnoses. A dose-effect relationship was seen with SSRIs and benzodiazepines.", 
    "148": "This study provides novel insight into the relationship between fractures and psychotropic medications in the elderly. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to have a greater risk than other psychotropic classes, and higher doses may further increase that risk.

    "149": "Two anaesthetic protocols were compared using pregnant sheep. In both groups of animals, anaesthesia was induced using an intravenous (i.v.) injection of diazepam and ketamine. The ewes were then intubated for positive pressure ventilation using 0.8 L/min of nitrous oxide and 2 L/min oxygen with 1.1-1.8% halothane. If the ewe showed any signs of awakening, one of two protocols was followed. First, the halothane concentration was increased to 2-3% until the ewe was completely anaesthetized. Second, the halothane concentration was not altered, but the ewe was given doses of i.v. diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine (1 mg/kg) until again completely anaesthetized. At the completion of surgery, maternal recovery was rapid and similar between the two groups. However, five days after surgery, the fetal arterial Po(2) and oxygen content of the fetuses receiving additional halothane (1.9 +/- 0.2 kPa and 4.4 +/- 1.0 mL/100 mL) were statistically significantly depressed when compared with the fetuses receiving additional diazepam and ketamine (2.9 +/- 0.1 kPa and 7.0 +/- 0.5 mL/100 mL). These results led us to conclude that certain anaesthetic protocols, in spite of good maternal recovery, can lead to deleterious effects upon the fetus that persist for at least five days after surgery.",

BMS occurs more frequently among postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, and evidence is conflicting; although some studies suggest a central origin, others point to a peripheral neuropathic origin. The efficacy of some medications in the treatment of BMS suggests that the dopaminergic system may be involved.", 
    "151": "The identification of risk factors for falls in longitudinal studies becomes difficult because of exposures that change during the follow-up and also because individual subjects may experience an event more than once. These issues have been neglected and improper statistical techniques have been used. The typical approaches have been to report the proportion of fallers or the time to first fall. Both avoid the underlying assumption of independence between events and discard pertinent data. We review the existing methods and propose a Cox hazards extension. We exemplify it in the study of potential risk factors associated with all falls in 959 seniors. Finally, we compare the results of the proposed Wei, Lin, & Weissfeld (WLW) method with those of several other techniques. Stable exposure variables measured at baseline and updated time-varying exposures include socio-demographic characteristics, BMI, nutritional risk, alcohol consumption, home hazards, gait and balance, and medications. Results demonstrate that the usual methods of analyzing risk factors for falling are inappropriate, as they produce considerable biases relative to the WLW model using time-dependent covariates. Results also show that modeling for first events may be inefficient, given that the risk of occurrence varies between falls.",

Practitioners were also surveyed about their perceptions of the program. Second, drop-out rates during the first four months of paroxetine treatment were estimated from a pharmacy database of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescriptions in South Africa.", 
    "154": "Patients who participated in a psychoeducational program demonstrated comparatively lower drop-out rates during treatment compared with drop-out rates in patients on paroxetine (and other SSRIs) obtained from a national pharmacy database. Improved adherence on the psychoeducational program was attributed to an increased understanding of depression and the need to take medication, a realization that patients are not alone (i.e., depression is a widespread problem) and a better understanding and acceptance of the possible side-effects of medication. Both practitioners and patients were positive about their experience of the program and 80% of doctors judged the program to be very useful.",

    "156": "A new drug delivery system containing hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) and a mucoadhesive polymer was developed with the aim to overcome the limitations connected with the nasal application of drugs with low water solubility. Lorazepam, free or as cyclodextrin inclusion complex, was loaded into mucoadhesive microparticles by spray drying, using hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), carbomer, and HPMC/carbomer interpolymer complex (IPC) as mucoadhesive components. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated the presence of drug crystalline areas in microparticles loaded with free lorazepam, whereas in those loaded with HP-beta-CD inclusion complex, the drug was amorphous. Zeta potential measurement revealed that the polymer was the main component on the surface of the microparticles. The swelling rate and mucoadhesive properties of the microparticles were determined by the polymer type used in formulation. IPC- and carbomer-based microparticles showed superior swelling rate and mucoadhesion compared with the HPMC-based microparticles (p < .05). Drug loading into the polymer matrix decreased the swelling rate as well as the mucoadhesive properties of microparticles (p < .05), whereas the presence of HP-beta-CD in the matrix did not induce any additional reduction of those parameters (p > .05). The in vitro dissolution studies demonstrated that the microparticles containing the lorazepam inclusion complex displayed 1.8-2.5 times faster drug release compared with those containing free lorazepam. The change in the drug release rate could be connected with improved drug solubility inside the polymer matrix due to inclusion complex formation, as well as to the reduction in crystallinity following complexation, as confirmed by DSC studies.",

However, we noted that acute SSRI administration also causes transient persistence increase, counteracted by mCPP pretreatment.",

    "171": "The cholecystokinin (CCK(1)) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor important for nutrient homeostasis. The molecular basis of CCK-receptor binding has been debated, with one prominent model suggesting occupation of the same region of the intramembranous helical bundle as benzodiazepines. Here, we used a specific assay of allosteric ligand interaction to probe the mode of binding of devazepide, a prototypic benzodiazepine ligand. Devazepide elicited marked slowing of dissociation of pre-bound CCK, only possible through binding to a topographically distinct allosteric site. This effect was disrupted by chemical modification of a cysteine in the benzodiazepine-binding pocket. Application of an allosteric model to the equilibrium interaction between a series of benzodiazepine ligands and CCK yielded quantitative estimates of each modulator's affinity for the allosteric site, as well as the degree of negative cooperativity for the interaction between occupied orthosteric and allosteric sites. The allosteric nature of benzodiazepine binding to the CCK(1) receptor provides new opportunities for small molecule drug development.", 
    "172": "Huntington's disease is a movement disorder originated from malfunctioning of Basal Ganglia (BG). There are some models for this disease, most of them being conceptual. So, it seems that considering all physiological information and structural specifications to develop a holistic model is needed. We introduce a computational model based on experimental and physiological findings. Parts of the brain known to be involved in Huntington's disease are all considered in our model and most features of the movement disorders have been appeared in the model. This mathematical model has considered the involved parts of the brain in a fairly accurate way, explaining the behavior and mechanism of the disease according to the physiological information. Our model has several advantages. It is able to simulate the normal and Huntington's disease stride time intervals. It shows how the present treatment, i.e. diazepam, is able to ameliorate the gait disorder. In this research we assessed the effects of changing some neurotransmitter levels in order to propose new treatments. Although we showed that gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) blockers reduce Huntington's disease movement disorder, but we discussed that it is unfair to use this route for treatment. We evaluated our model response to increment of GABA, alone and observed that the gait disorder was strengthened. Our novel idea in this regard is resuscitation of BG loop in order to maintain its major physiological functions, and at the same time raising the threshold in order to weaken the internal disturbances. Our last idea about BG treatment is to decrease glutamate. Our model was able to show the effectiveness of this treatment on Huntington's disease disturbances. We propose that experimental studies should be designed in which these two novel methods of treatment will be evaluated. This validation would implement a milestone in treatment of such a debilitating disease at Huntington.", 
    "173": "It is well known that prior experience to the elevated plus-maze increases the avoidance of rodents to the open arms and impairs the anxiolytic-like effect of benzodiazepines evaluated during a subsequent exposure to the maze, a phenomenon known as \"one-trial tolerance\". Centrally injected benzodiazepine drugs attenuate anxiety in some limbic structures, such as hypothalamus, amygdala and the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). This study investigated the effects of intra-PAG infusions of midazolam (MDZ) in maze-na\u00efve and maze-experienced mice. The antiaversive effects of MDZ (3.0 nmol and 30 nmol in 0.1 microl) were evaluated by prior injection of flumazenil (16 nmol/0.1 microl), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, into the same midbrain site. Test videotapes were scored for conventional measures of anxiety and locomotor activity, as well as a range of ethological measures related to risk assessment. In maze-na\u00efve mice, intra-PAG infusions of MDZ increased % open arm entries (3.0 nmol) and % open arm time (3.0 and 30 nmol). These effects were observed in the absence of significant changes in locomotor activity, indicating a selective anxiolytic-like effect of MDZ. The antiaversive effects of MDZ were completely blocked by prior injection of flumazenil which in turn did not alter any other behavioral measure. In maze-experienced mice, intra-PAG infusion of MDZ did not modify any behavioral measure. Taken together, present results corroborate previous studies demonstrating that GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex located within the PAG plays a role on anxiety modulation in maze-na\u00efve mice as well as indicate its involvement in the OTT phenomenon.", 
    "174": "Intra-nasally instilled benzodiazepines have been proposed for acute anxiety episodes. However, routes with faster absorption may increase abuse liability. This study compared abuse liability of intra-nasal midazolam between subjects with a history of intra-nasal drug abuse and non-psychiatric subjects on a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Thirty-one inhaled-cocaine abusers and 34 normal volunteers received either 1 mg intra-nasal midazolam or active placebo. Visual analogue scales assessing desire to repeat the experience (ER) and Experience Liking (EL) assessed abuse liability. Profile analysis for repeated measures showed a significant effect of time over ER (F([5,57])=3.311, p=0.011) and EL (F([5,57])=3.947, p=0.004), diagnostic group (cocaine abusers scoring higher on both - F([5,57])=5.229, p=0.026; F([5,57])=4.946, p=0.030), regardless of the administered substance. It is concluded that the intra-nasal route does not seem to pose risks for non-psychiatric individuals, but it may represent a risk in itself for subjects with a history of drug abuse through this path.", 
    "175": "Oroxylin A is a flavonoid that is found in the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of oroxylin A on the memory impairments and pathological changes induced by Abeta(25-35) peptide in mice. The ameliorating effect of oroxylin A on memory impairment was investigated using passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks and pathological changes were identified by immunostaining and western blotting. Abeta(25-35) peptide (5nmol) was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. In the acute treatment study, a single dose of oroxylin A (5mg/kg, p.o.) treated 1h before behavioral tests was found to significantly reverse Abeta(25-35)-induced cognitive impairments based on passive avoidance and Y-maze task findings (P<0.05). Moreover, these acute effects of oroxylin A were blocked by diazepam (1mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA(A)/benzodiazepine binding site agonist (P<0.05). On the other hand, our subchronic studies revealed that oroxylin A (1 or 5mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 7 days ameliorated the memory impairment induced by Abeta(25-35) peptide. Moreover, Abeta(25-35)-induced increases in GFAP (an astroglia marker) and OX-42 (a microglia marker), and increases in iNOS positive cells in the hippocampus were found to be attenuated by subchronic oroxylin A (1 or 5mg/kg/day, i.p., P<0.05). In addition, reductions in the immunoreactivity and protein level of ChAT (a cholinergic neuronal cell marker) in the CA3 hippocampal area induced by Abeta(25-35) peptide were also attenuated by oroxylin A. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation induced by Abeta(25-35) was also reduced by oroxylin A. These results suggest that the amelioration of Abeta(25-35) peptide-induced memory impairment by oroxylin A is mediated via the GABAergic neurotransmitter system after a single administration, or by reductions in Abeta(25-35) peptide-induced astrocyte and microglia activations, iNOS expression, lipid peroxidation, and increased cholinergic neurotransmission after subchronic administration.", 
    "176": "It has been shown in the rat that endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK), released in response to the non-nutrient trypsin inhibitor camostat, reduces food intake at meals and increases Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI; a marker for neuronal activation) in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of the hindbrain but not the myenteric plexus of the duodenum and jejunum. Experiment 1: We examined Fos-LI in the myenteric and the submucosal plexuses of the gut in response to orogastric gavage of camostat in rats. As we reported previously, camostat failed to increase Fos-LI in the myenteric plexus. We show here that camostat increased Fos-LI in the submucosal plexus of the duodenum and jejunum. Camostat also increased Fos-LI in the DVC. Experiment 2: Pretreatment with devazepide, a specific CCK(1) receptor antagonist abolished camostat-induced Fos-LI in the submucosal plexus and the DVC. Experiment 3: Bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy reduced camostat-induced Fos-LI in the submucosal plexus approximately 40% and abolished it in the DVC.", 
    "177": "Activation of the submucosal plexus by cholecystokinin at the CCK(1) receptor accompanies stimulation of the dorsal vagal complex of the hindbrain and inhibition of food intake. Unlike the submucosal plexus, activation of the myenteric plexus is not necessary for cholecystokinin's influence on the dorsal vagal complex and food intake. The lack of activation in the myenteric plexus after camostat stimulation, in contrast to nutrient releasers of CCK such as oleate, suggests that intestinal stimulants can either release different amounts of CCK or cause release of CCK from I cells with different molecular forms of CCK. This would suggest that CCK-8 is released by camostat and is not able to travel to the myenteric plexus while a more stable form of CCK such as CCK-58 can travel to this site that is further away from the I cell.", 
    "178": "Sedation-analgesia occupies an essential place in the specific therapeutic arsenal of the brain-injured patients. The maintenance of the perfusion of the brain, its relaxation and its protection are the fundamental objectives whose finality is to avoid the extension of the lesions and to preserve the neuronal capital. Sedation is instituted when patients are severely agitated or present a deterioration of their state of consciousness (GCS< or =8). Under cover of mechanical ventilation, sedation is the first line treatment of intracranial hypertension, a common pathway of various acute brain diseases of traumatic, vascular or other origin. The use of the combination of hypnotic and opioids is the rule. The combined action of these two classes reinforces and improves their sedative effects. Midazolam is the 2 benzodiazepine of reference. Propofol is more and more frequently added to the combination of hypnotic and opioids. The \"propofol infusion syndrome\" is a severe limitation to its long term administration in particular among patients presenting a severe septic or inflammatory state. Propofol will be imperatively stopped in the event of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal insufficiency, hyperkaliemia or increase in the blood triglyceride levels. The use of thiopental is restricted to the most severe cases. Its use as a monotherapy at high doses is abandoned to the profit of a co-administration with midazolam or even with the combination of midazolam and propofol. Thiopental overdose is very frequent in the event of associated hypothermia. Etomidate does not have its place apart from induction in fast sequence. The neuro-protective effects of ketamine require to be demonstrated in man before being recommended routinely. Withdrawal of sedation can be responsible for a state of agitation which can be controlled by neuroleptics.",

Matrix compounds in urine were eluted first from the column, while the target compounds were retained on the polymer stationary phase. The analytes retained on the column were then eluted into an acetonitrile-rich mobile phase using a gradient separation technique. All compounds showed base-peak ions due to [M+H]+ ions on LC/MS with positive ion electrospray ionization, and product ions were produced from each [M+H]+ ion by LC/MS/MS. Quantification was performed by selected reaction monitoring. All compounds spiked into urine showed method recoveries of 50.1-82.0%. The regression equations for all compounds showed excellent linearity in the range of 0.5-500 ng/mL of urine. The limits of detection and quantification for each compound were 0.1 and 0.5 ng/mL of urine, respectively. The intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation for all compounds in urine were not greater than 9.6%. The data obtained from actual determination of diazepam and its three metabolites, oxazepam, nordazepam and temazepam, in human urine after oral administration of diazepam, are also presented.", 
    "180": "Tremor is one of the most frequent neurological signs; the diagnosis is mainly clinical. The most frequent tremor is essential tremor, which manifests itself as a postural and kinetic tremor. Tremor may occur not only in the hands, but also in the head and voice. Parkinsonian tremor is a tremor at rest; the legs and face are frequently involved. Orthostatic tremor mainly manifests itself in the legs and gives rise to postural instability. Dystonic tremor is an action tremor of the affected region of the body. Drug therapy mostly depends on the clinical manifestation. Postural and action tremors respond to beta blockers, primidone, some antiepileptics and benzodiazepines. Classical rest tremors are improved by dopaminergic substances or anticholinergics. Dystonic tremor may be successfully treated by injecting botulinum toxin. Orthostatic tremor responds to gabapentin or benzodiazepines in some patients. In patients with severely disability, implantation of thalamic stimulation electrodes may be considered.",

We measured polymorphisms in a human endogenous retrovirus, Herv K-18, which is located in the CD48 signaling lymphocyte activating (SLAM) gene on chromosome 1. The study population consisted of 229 individuals with schizophrenia, 29 of whom had a history of type 2 diabetes, as well as 136 control individuals without a history of a psychiatric disorder or type 2 diabetes. We found that a haplotype defined by 2 polymorphisms in the envelope region of Herv K-18 is highly associated with type 2 diabetes in a population of 229 individuals with schizophrenia, with an odds ratio of 9.0 (95% confidence limits 2.3-34.7, p<.001) adjusted for race, gender and type of antipsychotic medication. Lower levels of association were found in other polymorphisms located in the 3'untranslated region of Herv K-18 and in adjacent loci in CD48. Polymorphisms in endogenous retroviruses which are located near immunomodulatory genes may constitute risk factors for diabetes in individuals with schizophrenia.",
