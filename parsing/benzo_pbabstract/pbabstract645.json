A rapid intravenous injection, m ml/kg bodyweight, followed by continous drip infusion constituted the method used. No important side effects were seen, except psychotomimetic reactions in two cases. Cardiovascular disturbances were absent and no significant intracranial pressure rise occurred in nine patients examined.", 
    "1": "The taxonomic description of Streptomyces spadicogriseus, a new species belonging to the Gray Series of streptomycetes as classified by Pridham and Tresner, is presented. This new species is distinguishable from the known members of the Gray Series. Streptomyces spadicogriseus produces anthramycin but bears no taxonomic relation to the known producer of the antibiotic: S. refuineus var. thermotolerans.", 
    "2": "Eighty-seven patients with an acute myocardial infarction and a pulse rate of greater than or equal to 80/min on admission were randomly allotted to one group given cardioselective beta-blockade, a second group given diazepam, and a third group given placebo. The three groups were comparable in age, sex distribution, previous history of ischemic heart disease, initial pulse rate, blood pressure, pain index, enzyme values, and degree of ST elevation. The acute mortality (within 10 days) did not differ between the groups. The drug treatment elicited no reduction of infarct size, as judged from enzyme levels, degree of reduction of ST elevation, or physical exercise capacity. The reasons for this negative result are discussed. One possibility is that in routine clinical practice the therapeutic intervention starts too late after onset of symptoms. A beneficial effect on mortality among the patients whose treatment started early after onset of symptoms supports this conclusion.", 
    "3": "In order to study the role of the septo-hippocampal system and the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) substance in punished behavior and in the action of minor tranquilizers, two groups of rats were trained to lever press on a continuous reinforcement schedule of food presentation. In one group, every response was subsequently punished by foot-shock delivery; in the other, by brief electrical stimulation of the DPAG of the mesencephalon. In both groups response rats were reduced to less than 10% of pre-punishment rates, but not completely supressed. Response rates did not significantly differ between the two groups, either before or after the introduction of punishment. Septal lesions significantly increased responding in the animals punished by foot-shock, but did not affect responding suppressed by DPAG stimulation. Injection of chlordiazepoxide (5mg/kg,IP) significantly increased punished responding in both groups of rats, before as well as after the septal lesion. Before the septal lesion was made, responding suppressed by foot-shock was significantly more released by chlordiazepoxide than responding punished by DPAG stimulation. These results suggest that in punishment tests using foot-shock, both a behavioral inhibitory system, including the septo-hippocampal structures and an aversive or punishment system, including the DPAG substance, act together to produce response suppression. Both these systems would be depressed by minor tranquilizers in order to cause their anti-punishment and perhaps their anti-anxiety action as well.", 
    "4": "Chlordiazepoxide (5, 10 mg/kg) increased the time devoted to eating familiar laboratory chow without altering the response to a range of novel, palatable foods which were also available to the food-deprived rats. Prior experience with the same range of alternative foods (food familiarization) radically changed the effect of the drug. After familiarization with these foods, chow was virtually ignored as a food choice, indicating its low relative palatability; chlordiazepoxide then prolonged the time eating the familiarized foods without significantly increasing the response to chow. These results are not consistent with an anti-food neophobia action of chordiazepoxide. They suggest instead that chlordiazepoxide enhances feeding responses related to food saliency. Footshock, delivered two days before the food choice test affected performance within the test. Its effects were opposite those of chlordiazepoxide, but they competed additively with the drug's effects. These results indicate that chlordiazepoxide's action was not simply to remove any inhibitory effect on feeding produced by fear; instead the drug promoted approach to food antagonizing any deficit in approach associated with fear. These findings are viewed as consistent with an action of chlordiazepoxide to augment the level of feeding motivation. Chlordiazepoxide (15 mg/kg) may act to overcome food neophobia.", 
    "5": "Pretreatment (IP) of mice with (-) baclofen, muscimol, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (S,4-c) pyridin-3-ol hydrate (THIP), aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) or gamma-acetylenic GABA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of thelocomotor stimulant effect of phencyclidine (PCP, 8 mg/kg). Although (-) baclofen was found to be the most effective PCP antagonist, its (+) isomer was inactive. The maximum blocking effect of AOAA was seen in animals treated 3 and 6 hr earlier. Except for gamma-acetylenic GABA, none of these drugs significantly blocked the locomotor stimulant effect of d-amphetamine (3 mg/kg, IP). Diazepam reduced d-amphetamine response, but failed to influence PCP-induced stimulation. The locomotor stimulant effect of PCP, unlike that of d-amphetamine, may be the result of a specific GABA antagonistic effect at certain dopamine-rich areas of the brain. It seems that (-) baclofen may prove to be useful in the management of PCP intoxication. Administration of higher doses of PCP (20 and 50 mg/kg) in mice pretreated with (-) baclofen resulted in the development of surgical anesthesia manifested as the loss of a) righting reflex, b) pain sensation and c) corneal reflex. The duration of the general anesthetic response was found to be a function of the doses of both (-) baclofen and PCP. The possible use of (-) baclofen as an adjuvant to general anesthetic is discussed.", 
    "6": "Inhibition of gastric acid secretion by the combined use of cimetidine and pirenzepin has been studied in 5 cases of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In 4 acute cases i.v. cimetidine and i.m. pirenzepin were administered together as a treatment and were successful in 3 out of the 4 cases as judged by the disappearance of clinical symptoms and healing of the gastroduodenal and jejunal mucosal ulcerations. Secretory measurements indicated that addition of pirenzepin to cimetidine resulted in larger and more prolonged inhibition of acid secretion in these patients. The continuous record of intragastric pH in the 5th patient, over 24-hour periods, confirmed the above findings. Despite the use of large doses of pirenzepin, no significant side effects were noticed.", 
    "7": "One thousand eight emergency room patient records from which reports were contributed to the federal Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) system from the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center in 1977 were studied. The drugs reported to DAWN for these patients were compared with the available toxicology laboratory reports for some of these same patients. The purpose was to test the validity of the data reported to DAWN. Toxologic analyses had been performed on only 528 patients (52%) of the entire sample. Eighty percent of these tested had some positive toxicology result. The DAWN reports were verified in 20% of the tested sample, found to be incorrect in 11%, and partially correct or partially incorrect in 69%. Drugs identified toxicologically had varied concentrations, some below or within therapeutic range and some at toxic levels. This study suggests that the reliability of DAWN REPORTS SHOULD BE TESTed prospectively in an unbiased definitive material study.", 
    "8": "Previous research findings on the interaction between drugs and microwave radiation were extended to chlorpromazine and to diazepam. The drugs were combined with a 1 mW/cm2 pulsed microwave field (2.8 GHz) and effects were measured on a fixed interval (FI 1) schedule of food reinforcement with rats. Dose-effect functions with and without sham irradiation were established for each drug. At effective doses chlorpromazine consistently decreased rate of responding and reduced with-interval response patterning. Low to moderate doses of diazepam produced little change or increases in response rate, and higher doses produced a decline in response rate. Response patterning within intervals was reduced by increasing doses of diazepam. The animals were exposed to the microwave field alone before test sessions combining the drugs with microwave radiation. Microwave exposure alone did not affect FI performance. Microwave radiation in combination with either drug did not produce any alterations in the dose-effect functions.", 
    "9": "The study involved 51 healthy males aged 20 -- 24, divided into two groups. Group I (30 subjects) performed exercise on a cycle ergometer with the load increasing according to the following schedule: 1 W/kg for six minutes, 2 W/kg -- six minutes, and 3 W/kg -- six minutes. The remaining 21 subjects (group II) performed identical exercise one hour after they had been administered 10 mg of diazepam (Relanium-Polfa). The determinations made included arterial blood levels of FFA, triglyceride, and glucose before the exercise, after each successive phase of the exercise, and in the course of restitution (30 minutes and 4 hours after the exercise). One hour after diazepam administration, the FFA, triglyceride and glucose levels decreased. After the successive phases of the exercise, the FFA levels were significantly lower among group II subjects, and continued to be so also in the 30th minute after the exercise. The decrease in the triglyceride levels during the exercise was higher among the diazepam subjects, and they were slightly lower also in the course of restitution. In both groups the glucose levels gradually increased after each phase of the exercise, and the increase after the third phase was higher among the diazepam subjects. During restitution the glucose concentration was higher than before the exercise, and slightly higher in group II.",

    "12": "The effects of chlorpromazine (CPZ) and imipramine (IMP) on platelet aggregation in vitro were investigated. Both CPZ and IMP inhibited epinephrine-induced secondary aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion and changed adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced irreversible aggregation into a reversible response in human platelets. With rabbit platelets, CPZ (0.6-20 microM) and IMP (6-60 microM) showed a selective inhibitory effect on the aggregation by collagen, whereas, even at 200 microM, this effect was found neither in arachidonic acid (AA)-induced aggregation nor in ADP-induced one. CPZ and IMP also inhibited human platelet aggregations induced by collagen, but not by AA. The antiaggregating action of CPZ and IMP was thought to be due to their inhibitory effects on AA liberation from platelet membranes, suggesting that they might inhibit participating enzymes (phospholipase A2, C or lipase) or the process of the activation of the enzymes.", 
    "13": "3-Benzazepine derivatives manifested cytotoxic effects in in vitro tests on lympholeukemia P388 cells. The most efficient derivative (QF 1), i. e. 7,8-dihydro-3,4,12-trimetoxy-7-dimethylamino-10,11-methylenedioxy-5H-indolo [1,2-b][3]benzazepine-5-on in a concentration as low as 5 microliter/ml, considerably inhibited only the incorporation of labeled uridine into P388 cell fractions. In in vitro experiments, this substance blocked cell proliferation. After its prolonged action, the number of dead cells increased and this also when its interaction with the cells lasted but a short time--the substance being removed from the medium. In all probability, the substance retains the cells in the G1/S phase. A marked synergistic effect of tubercidine was attained in the presence of the substance.", 
    "14": "The biotransformation of several prodrug-type esters of centrally acting 1, 4-benzodiazepines was studied. Their rates of hydrolysis catalyzed by the hepatic microsomal fraction of mice were measured by pH-stat. The heterogeneity of the microsomal esterases was investigated with induction by phenobarbital and with inhibition by DFP. The resulting changes in esterase activity indicated that the phenyl-substituted esters separate from the homogenous sets of oxazepam and lorazepam esters. Regression analysis of the relative hydrolysis rates of the homogenous ester sets revealed a similar dependence on the steric ES the polar sigma* and hydrophobic deltaRM terms of the acyl moiety. The role of the polar term shows that a nucleophilic attack of the acyl moiety determines the hydrolysis. The role of hydrophobicity can be attributed to its interrelation with the steric parameter. The common equations for the aliphatic sters of oxazepam and larazepam suggest the similar nature of the esterases in question and the same catalytic mechanism. Different 3-acetoxy-1, 4-benzodiazepines were also synthetised and their maximal hydrolysis rates were quite different. This excludes the possibility that the deacylation step of the enzymes is rate-determining. Instead, our data suggest that acylation of the microsomal esterases is rate-limiting for the hydrolysis of the aliphatic esters of 3-OH-benzodiazepines.", 
    "15": "A 6-month follow-up of 184 anxious depressed neurotic outpatients who reported improvement after controlled drug trials of several weeks duration revealed an astonishing relapse rate of 81% for anxious and 87% for depressed patients. Early as compared to late relapse was associated with more chronicity and less improvement at the end of the drug trial, while type of drug received did not affect relapse. Onset of relapse had no effect on help-seeking behavior. At time of follow-up, non-relapsed patients had lowest and untreated relapsed patients had highest symptom levels. It was concluded that short-term drug treatment alone does not represent sufficient therapy for chronic neurotic anxious or depressed outpatients.", 
    "16": "Long-term effects of diazepam on plasma lipids and atheroma in roosters fed an atherogenic diet have been studied. Our data indicate that long-term administration (8 months) of diazepam (Valium) 0.2 mg/kg orally lowered the plasma cholesterol level when compared to the atherogenic group, but this was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). However, at the dose of 0.4 mg/kg of Valium the plasma cholesterol was significantly lowered when compared to the controls on an atherogenic diet (P less than 0.05). Both doses of Valium significantly decreased the incidence and severity of lesions on the endothelial surface of the aorta and coronary artery in roosters fed an atherogenic diet. No changes in plasma triglyceride values were noted. Administration of 0.4 mg/kg of Valium to birds receiving the atherogenic diet produced a small but significant increase of mean, systolic and diastolic blood pressures as compared to the birds receiving an atherogenic diet but no Valium. A similar increase in blood pressure was also noted in the control group on plain mash diet receiving 0.2 mg/kg of Valium. Microscopic examination of the coronary arteries showed that birds on an atherogenic regimen receiving Valium had less atherosclerosis than those not receiving Valium.", 
    "17": "A simple, specific, and sensitive high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of clonazepam in plasma is described. The drug was extracted with chloroform at an alkaline pH using flunitrazepam as internal standard. The HPLC analysis was performed using a column packed with Spherisorb C6 reverse phase, the mobile phase being a solution of acetonitrile sodium acetate 0.1 M (40/60, v/v); the ultraviolet detector was set at 306 nm. The calibration curve was linear for plasma concentrations between 2 and 200 ng/ml-1 when 1 ml of sample was analyzed. Diazepam, its metabolites, and the most common antiepileptics did not interfere with the analysis. The coefficient of variation at the lowest concentration was 14%. With this method, clonazepam can also be used as internal standard for the determination of flunitrazepam. The performance of the column was still satisfactory after the analysis of more than 500 plasma samples.", 
    "18": "With the aid of v. Zerssen's emotional scores the emotional condition of patients with toxic or cold thyroid adenomas was tested before operation with and without administration of oxazepam (Anxiolit retard). There was a significant improvement of the general condition not only in patients with toxic adenoma but also in patients with cold adenoma. Thus the preoperative application of Oxazepam is indicated before strumectomy to avoid stress symptoms and anxiety fits.", 
    "19": "Chlordiazepoxide HCl, a widely used tranquilizer, was evaluated for pre- and postnatal effects in rats by dosing orally on days 1--21 of gestation. In the prenatal study, maternally tolerated doses of 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day of chlordiazepoxide produced a dose-related decrease in fetal weight and an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies. The latter consisted of retarded calvarial ossification and miscellaneous sternal defects. In the postnatal study, the parturition was delayed for 24 h in a few dams from the 25 and 50 mg/kg groups. There was a reduction in the pup survival and mean pup weight, an increase in the number of runts, an impairment in locomotion and a delay in hair growth and opening of vagina. The 12-week-old female offspring in the 50 mg/kg group manifested a marked prolongation of hexobarbital sleeping time; suggesting that the hepatic microsomal enzymes have been suppressed in these animals.", 
    "20": "The effect of hyperglycemia on growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin response to oral diazepam (10 mg) was assessed in 7 normal subjects. A peak growth hormone response of 13.5 +/- 0.3 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) significantly above the base line (p less than 0.001) was achieved when diazepam was given alone. Hyperglycemia after glucose load abolished this response. There was no significant response of thyroid-stimulating hormone or prolactin after the administration of oral diazepam with and without glucose.", 
    "21": "The benzodiazepine nitrazepam, which has a marked hypnotic effect in human subjects and a myorelaxating effect in mice with aggressive behaviour, was applied in non-isolated and isolated non-aggressive and aggressive mice. The observed weaker inhibition of exploration behaviour is isolated mice (mice with isolation syndrome) compared with non-isolated mice suggests the significance of the functional activity of the serotoninergic system in the brain for the manifestation of the effects of the drug, since in mice with isolation syndrome the serotonin turnover is changed. The results obtained by combined application of nitrazepam with cyproheptadine suggest that nitrazepam exercises its influence partly by stimulation of the postsynaptic serotonin receptors. Combined application of nitrazepam with fenfluramine shows that serotonin and to a lesser extent the remaining neurotransmitters affected by fenfluramine play a considerable role in the mechanism of action of this benzodiasepine.", 
    "22": "Highly purified rat liver mitochondria are able to reduce nitro groups of organic compounds to primary amines. This reductase-activity is bound to mitochondrial inner membrane or its matrix. It has no plain substrate specificity whereas it will attack the various substrates at widely different rates [nitrazepam (Mogadan) 1.7 times faster than 4-nitrobenzoic acid]. The activity was markedly inhibited under aerobic conditions. The rate of nitrazepam reduction by rat liver mitochondria was about 1/3--1/4 the rate by microsomal fraction, provided that both preparations contained the same protein amounts. NADH was required as a cofactor, but the nitroreduction was also stimulated by some Krebs cycle intermediates, especially by alpha-ketoglutarate. The reaction was markedly inhibited by organic solvents, even by little volumes. DMSO and DMF are cancelling every activity.", 
    "23": "The blood levels and the elimination kinetics of flurazepam and its major metabolites in blood were investigated in 10 volunteers after application of 60 mg flurazepam (Dalmadorm). Hydroxyethylflurazepam and desalkylflurazepam are the metabolites suitable for proving a previous flurazepam ingestion. Splitting of glucuronides is helpful for the determination of hydroxyethylflurazepam as the maximum blood concentration of the unconjugated metabolite does not exceed 1/3 of the concentration after glucuronidase splitting. Because of the different half-lives of formation and of elimination a characteristic time dependent pattern of flurazepam and its metabolites is observed in blood during 24 h after a single dosing. From this, conclusions may be drawn about the period of time between ingestion and sampling of the blood specimen. The accumulation of desalkylflurazepam is indicative of the dose applied or of previous multiple dosing. Parallel to the rise of the blood concentration of the metabolites the excretion of the corresponding hydroxyethylflurazepam glucuronide is detectable in urine. Within 30 min the concentrations are suitable for thin-layer chromatographic quantitation. An impaired performance of the volunteers was observed essentially during the absorption and the early distribution phase.", 
    "24": "Abstinence syndrome pattern produced by withdrawal of morphine injections in doses of 240 mg/kg daily was studied in experiments on mice. Pirroksan, butyroxan and carbidine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) inhibited manifestations of morphine withdrawal in an \"open field\" situation and depressed jumping activity. Phenazepam (20 mg/kg) depressed emotional hyperactivity in abstinent animals.", 
    "25": "Patients undergoing dental extraction under intravenous diazepam sedation were studied to determine whether physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, reverses diazepam-induced sedation. A modified Bender-Gestalt Dot Test was used to measure psychomotor function. Patient self-assessment of recovery and a surgeon's independent assessment of recovery were scored on a 0 to 10 measured scale before and after administration of either a physostigmine-atropine mixture (nine patients) or saline (12 patients). The physostigmine-atropine mixture did not significantly speed recovery or improve psychomotor function when compared with normal saline. The results indicate that, in contradiction to previous case report, the analeptic effect of physostigmine may be specific for anticholinergic drugs.", 
    "26": "One hundred sixty one epileptic patients, resistant to standard antiepileptic medication, were treatecd with clonazepam. In 19 cases clonazepam was given during the epileptic status. In 17 cases the status was stopped. In the remaining 142 patients clonazepam was given orally. The short term effect of the drug was analysed after 3 months of observation and the long term effect after a period of more than 1 year of observation. The authors compare the relationship between the clinical form of epilepsy, the EEG changes and the duration of disease with the long and short term therapeutic effect of clonazepam. The results obtained suggest: short term therapy is more successful than long term therapy, poor results or intolerance at the beginning of the treatment occur in about 20% of patients. The influence of clonazepam on epilepsy with focal seizures is relatively better than on generalized forms of epilepsy. \"Old\" cases of epilepsy are significantly more resistant to clonazepam medication. The same is true for diffuse brain damage.", 
    "27": "Sixty patients undergoing major digestive surgery received the same amount of drugs for induction of anesthesia; neuroleptic, morphinomimetic and pachycurares were used and calculated in mg/kg. A randomisation list permitted to define 45 patients who received in double blind (by means of a long electrical cord), an electrical current varying for each protocol; the control group (15 patients) did not receive an electrical current. Statistical study of the amount of drugs used for follow of anesthesia shows no real effect of electrical analgesia for digestive surgery.", 
    "28": "Standard EEG tracings were recorded in 25 patients with anatomically confirmed Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease. A total of 82 recordings were studied, and were found to conform with those previously described. More particularly, the periodic paroxystic tracing described by Nevin in 1954 was observed in 16 cases, but these were of late onset, frequent, and non-specific. By adopting the anatomical classification described by Daniel (1972), the authors were able to obtain some evidence of electro-anatomical correlations in some cases, but confirmation by means of a larger series of patients is necessary.", 
    "29": "While the effects of short-term benzodiazepine treatment have been extensively studied in several well-designed, controlled, clinical trials, further information is needed on the value and risks of anxiolytic drugs when administered over months to maintain chronic patients. Clinical trials on the effects of long-term benzodiazepine treatment present several methodological problems. The aim of this paper is to discuss these problems in relation to samples, drugs and dosage, duration, measures and experimental design.", 
    "30": "The syndromes described are often related to primary endocrine or development defects, but may also result from purely educational or psychological problems. Adolescents may find it difficult to seek help, particularly in the younger age range where early medical intervention is important. While psychotherapy alone is often advisable, the use of anxiolytic agents may be an effective adjunctive treatment. Benzodiazepines are particularly useful because they do not stimulate enzyme activity as do some sedative agents. Teenagers are dependent on the expectations of their parents, and as ANTHONY and RIZZO [1971] have emphasized, the administration of drugs to a member of a family demands an understanding of such expectations, as well as a subtle awareness of the dynamic homeostasis and interactional patterns prevalent in the family at the time. The expectations of parents and the physician concerning the changes due to the drugs prescribed should be synchronized by mutual discussions and questioning. The adolescent has less anxiety tolerance, fewer brakes, less facilities for elaborating his symptoms on symbolic levels, and diminished capacities for postponement of impulsive gratifications; all these factors are important in achieving results by psychological methods alone. The time factor urges us to combine psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy; a well-selected drug in moderate dosage will not necessarily impair the transference. We may take the advise of Plato, who said that the drug effect should be supplemented with parleys (\"epodai\") which will guieten down or cheer up the soul. The modern sex therapist dealing with adolescents might follow this direction.", 
    "31": "A double-blind trial was carried out in 45 anxious out-patients to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of clobazam and diazepam. The severity of each patient's symptoms was assessed before, during and at the end of the trial period using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and a note kept of any side-effects. The results showed that a single daily dose of 20 mg clobazam was equally as effective as 5 mg diazepam 3-times daily. Clobazam, however, produced considerably fewer side-effects than diazepam, especially drowsiness.", 
    "32": "Symptoms of diazepam withdrawal developed in a young man who had been taking diazepam in dosages of 15 to 25 mg/day during a six-year period. This was verified in a study conducted under placebo-controlled, double blind conditions, with plasma levels of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, monitored throughout the course of the study. Severe symptoms of physiological withdrawal were observed within two days of replacement of diazepam with placebo capsules. The patient recovered promptly on reinstitution of diazepam administration, and relapsed during a second withdrawal phase. During an additional two week-period of placebo administration, the patient's condition first worsened, then gradually improved. Examination of plasma levels of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam indicated no obvious pharmacokinetic abnormalities. Thus, with long-term administration of diszepam, even in therapeutically accepted doses, withdrawal reactions can be encountered on abrupt termination.", 
    "33": "Ten patients affected by various myoclonic syndromes were tested with drugs acting on cerebral serotonin metabolism and with clonazepam (CZP). After L5HTP or serotonergic drugs administration a clear cut improvement was observed in the 2 patients affected by Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, while the patients with myoclonic epilepsy have shown no effect (3 cases) or negative response (1 case). Methysergide was active only in 1 patient affected by progressive erratic myoclonus who had a striking worsening of clinical picture. The main side effects observed were: gastrointestinal distress (L5HTP--4 patients, fenfluoramine--2, quipazine--1, methysergide--2) and cutaneous rash (quipazine--1 case). These results support the possible implication of the serotonergic system in the pathogenesis of myoclonus other than post-anoxic.", 
    "34": "Atropine and an eightfold greater amount of pirenzepine inhibit pentagastrin-stimulated secretion to nearly the same extent (70-75%). Neither drug influences acid concentrations markedly (18%). Atropine and pirenzepine decrease the potassium concentration of gastric juice. By increasing electrical vagal stimulation the inhibitory effect of cimetidine decreases. In contrast, inhibition of vagally stimulated secretion by pirenzepine or by atropine averages 45%, when vagally stimulated secretion amounts to more than 50% of the pentagastrin-stimulated secretion. Thus pirenzepine inhibits gastric secretion similarly to atropine. These results support the hypothesis of a histamine and a cholinergic receptor.", 
    "35": "The effects of atropine and pirenzepine on sham-feeding stimulated gastric secretion and serum gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide levels have been studied in 12 patients with duodenal ulcer. Both atropine and pirenzepine caused a dose-dependent decrease in acid and pepsin secretion induced by sham-feeding. Serum gastrin response to sham-feeding was negative and it was enhanced by atropine but suppressed by pirenzepine. Plasma pancreatic polypeptide level, which was markedly increased by sham-feeding, was abolished both by atropine and pirenzepine. This study shows that pirenzepine is a more selective inhibitor of gastric secretory and serum hormonal responses to sham-feeding than atropine and that it may be a useful tool for studying the cholinergic innervation of the oxyntic glands and the G-cells in man.", 
    "36": "Using tritiated N-methyl-scopolamine (3H-NMS), muscarinic receptor binding was demonstrated in broken cell preparation of mucosa and smooth muscle of the fundus of the canine stomach. Binding curves of pirenzepine were established in competition experiments against 3H-NMS. Pirenzepine shows a considerably higher affinity to muscarinic receptors from fundic mucosa than those from smooth muscle, suggesting a difference of muscarinic receptors in these two regions of the stomach. Different properties of mucosal and smooth muscle receptors could be further substantiated by agonist binding studies. Whilst carbachol binding to muscarinic receptors from fundic smooth muscle was modulated by guanine nucleotides, no such effect was found in fundic mucosa. Direct binding studies with 3H-NMS demonstrated muscarinic receptors in peripheral ganglia (sympathetic trunk ganglia from the calf, stellate ganglia from the dog). These are characterized by high affinity pirenzepine binding so that besides its direct action on gastric secretory glands, pirenzepine may influence indirectly gastrointestinal functions via peripheral, presumably intramural, ganglia.", 
    "37": "A single dose of 10 mg of pirenzepine given i.m. to 7 healthy volunteers did not elicit local or general signs of intolerance within 6 hours after injection. We also found no significant differences in tests of vegetative symptomatology, visual motor coordination, attention concentration, critical flicker test threshold, nor any other aspects of the central nervous or cardiovascular systems. Ten patients with ulcers receiving pirenzepine 25 mg twice daily also showed no significant changes in psychometric tests, neurotic symptomatology, anxiety, depressive signs and clinical state during 4 weeks treatment. Side-effects of the anticholinergic type occurred only after high doses.", 
    "38": "Effects of pirenzepine on quantitative EEG, heart rate, blood pressure, critical flicker-fusion frequency, vigilance measures, and symptom reports were studied in 23 adult male volunteers under thirty years of age. Oral single doses ranged from 12.5 to 150 mg. Placebo-controlled studies were done in twelve subjects at 100 mg and in ten subjects at 150 mg. Pirenzepine administration was associated with reduced heart rate, dry mouth, and difficulty in focussing near vision. No systematic central activity of the compound was demonstrated at these doses.", 
    "39": "In order to investigate a possible central nervous action of pirenzepine, an anti-ulcer drug with structural similarities to tricyclic psychotropic drugs, serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of pirenzepine have been measured in five healthy volunteers after therapeutic dosage over 2.5 days. The cerebrospinal fluid:serum ratio was 0.095:1, indicating that pirenzepine passed the blood-brain barrier, but only to a small extent. The pirenzepine concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were for each volunteer on average about 10% of those found in serum. These findings correspond to the lack of central effects of pirenzepine as shown in animal and human experiments.", 
    "40": "Pirenzepine is a very hydrophilic compound. As a consequences its penetration through biomembranes and hence its absorption after oral administration is limited. The variability in plasma pirenzepine after a single oral dose of 50 mg (2 x 25 mg tablet) was investigated in ten countries in a total of 87 volunteers. Pirenzepine was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Plasma level profiles were similar in every country with a peak of about 50 ng/ml within two hours after the dose. The mean terminal half-life of disposition was 11 hours. Although the area under the plasma level curve was not normally distributed throughout the population, there was a narrow distribution around the median. It is often accepted that drugs or drug formulations with low bioavailability show high variations in the rates and extent of absorption. Pirenzepine, however, shows consistently uniform plasma level profiles, well within the therapeutic range after multiple dosing (50 mg, twice daily). Only a small proportion of the population may need individual adjustment of the conventional dose regimen.", 
    "41": "Combinations of H2-receptor antagonists and classical anticholinergics inhibit stimulated gastric acid secretion more than either drug alone. In double blind, placebo controlled, randomised studies we have compared the effects of single and combined intravenous bolus injections of cimetidine and pirenzepine on peptone-stimulated acid secretion and serum gastrin in man. Combined injection of 3.0 mg/kg cimetidine and 0.3 mg/kg pirenzepine suppressed stimulated acid secretion significantly more than either drug alone, and by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 8) and patients with duodenal ulcer (n = 5). Side-effects (prolactin stimulation, blurred vision) were diminished by reducing the combined dosages to 1.5 mg/kg cimetidine, to 0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg pirenzepine in another series (n = 10). Postprandial gastrin was not affected by any combination. Combination of cimetidine and pirenzepine suppress food-stimulated gastric secretion more effectively than combination of H2-blockers with classical anticholinergics. Pirenzepine--unlike classical anticholinergics--may distinguish between different subclasses of muscarinic receptors and have a more selective antimuscarinic action. Its interaction with H2-receptor antagonists on parietal cell function seems to be synergistic. Such a combination could be of advantage in patients with gastrinoma, in patients with ulcers and hypersecretion resistant to single drug treatment, and in critically ill patients as prophylaxis of stress ulcer bleeding.", 
    "42": "Pirenzepine has been shown to evoke a variety of antimuscarinic effects in animals. However, in contrast to classical antimuscarinic drugs, pirenzepine inhibits gastric acid secretion at much lower doses than those required to block smooth muscle action and to cause tachycardia. To investigate this novel behaviour we have compared the binding properties of pirenzepine to muscarinic receptors with those of a classical muscarinic antagonist, N-methyl-scopolamine. Binding has been determined in subcellular preparations of the sublingual, submandibular, parotid and lacrimal glands, smooth muscle of ileum and stomach, heart and several brain regions of the rat. Whereas N-methyl-scopolamine binds to an apparently uniform population of muscarinic receptors with little regional variation in affinity constant, the binding of pirenzepine in peripheral tissues is characterised by its low affinity in smooth muscle and the heart and considerably higher affinities to muscarinic receptors in exocrine glands and fundus mucosa, in agreement with the pharmacological profile of the drug. Furthermore, within the central nervous system and some exocrine glands, pirenzepine distinguishes between subclasses of muscarinic receptors which are not detected by classical antagonists. This evidence suggests that the unusual receptor binding properties of pirenzepine may make its selective antimuscarinic action possible.", 
    "43": "25 albino rats of Wistar strain were used for the study. They were divided into three groups. Animals of the first group (n = 10) were treated with Diphenylhydantoin in a daily dose of 70 mg/kg for three months. Animals of the second group (n = 10) were treated with Diazepam in a daily dose of 10 mg/kg for 3 months. Animals of the third group (n = 5) were treated with 5% acacia oil for the same period of time. Food and water consumption together with motor activity were measured. As indices of enzyme induction, D-Glucaric acid and liver weight were determined. Also the following bone indices were determined: femur Ca/femur weight, femur Ca/body weight, humerus Ca/humerus weight, humerus Ca/body weight, femur specific weight, humerus specific weight. Statistically significant alterations of bone mass were found.", 
    "44": "During the biological research on trithiozine [4-(3,4,5-trimethoxythiobenzoyl)-tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine], a substance with gastric antisecretory action, a study on peri- and post-natal toxicity was conducted in rats, during which an attempt was made to set up a series of tests which would consist of the study of the behaviour of offspring in their first 21 days of life. To confirm the validity of these tests, a parallel peri- and post-natal toxicity study was carried out with two compounds phenobarbital and diazepam, known to be active on the CNS and likewise known to pass from plasma into milk. The three compounds in question were administered by the oral route to pregnant rats from the 15th day of pregnancy to the 20th day after delivery in the following dosages; trithiozine: 100-200-500 mg/kg/day, phenobarbital: 60-100 mg/kg/day, diazepam: 30-60 mg/kg/day. The offspring were submitted, between their 14th and 20th day of life to the chemin\u00e9e test, traction test, righting reflex test and avoidance test. The chemin\u00e9e and avoidance tests proved to be the most suitable for studying neonatal behaviour. The percentage of success in these two tests decreased in a statistically significant manner for the groups treated with phenobarbital and diazepam, while trithiozine did not produce any variations in neonatal behaviour.", 
    "45": "In the majority of dental schools there are insufficient numbers of clinical patients for all students to receive optimal experience in intravenous sedation. This investigation was carried out to assess whether the signs and symptoms for intravenous sedation taught to the undergraduates were sufficiently objective to ensure that this clinical deficiency was not detrimental to competency of the graduating student. The signs of ptosis, altered speech and blurred vision were used by both experienced dentists and novice students to assess the level of intravenous sedation. Blurred vision was found to be unreliable while altered speech was more accurate than ptosis. The more experienced the operator the earlier the signs were observed.The \"Guidelines for the Teaching of Pain and Anxiety Control in Dentistry\" were initially formulated by the American Dental Association in 1971 and revised in 1978(1) while similar guidelines were accepted by the House of Delegates of the Association of the Canadian Faculties of Dentistry in 1975(2) Both of these documents outlined the course of instructions necessary for the teaching of all modalities of pain and apprehension control at the undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing education level. Implementation of these guidelines at the undergraduate level has proven to be particularly difficult in the area of intravenous sedation because of the lack of suitable patients. This has resulted in many students graduating, having had little practical experience in sedating a patient with an intravenous drug. It is the hope of educators in this field that lectures, seminars, and demonstrations given to dental students are sufficient to overcome this deficiency.Since the most critical clinical aspect of intravenous sedation is titrating the amount of drug required without overdosing or underdosing the patient, it was decided to investigate this ability in students with no clinical experience with intravenous diazepam. Although many drugs and techniques are advocated(3,4,5) it was decided to limit the study to intravenous diazepam as it may be used alone and has a high therapeutic index.With the introduction of diazepam to clinical practice the symptomatology of the drug was established and described by clinicians.(6,7) Objective methods of measuring recovery from diazepam have been described by several authors(8,9,10) but the signs and symptoms used to assess the initial level of sedation have been subjective. This can be attributed to the fact that sedation is an ill-defined clinical effect and can, therefore, only be calibrated by individual arbitary signs. The most frequently used signs for intravenous diazepam sedation are ptosis, also referred to as \"the Verrill sign,\"(11) altered speech and blurred vision.(7) This investigation was designed to test the reliability of these signs and to examine the variability of observations between clinicians and students.", 
    "46": "Pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) markedly reduced the lethality of the antitumor antibiotic anthramycin as well as its ability to decrease ventricular weights. In tumor-bearing mice CoQ pretreatment did not produce any consistent alteration of radioactivity levels in blood, heart, tumor, lungs, kidneys, liver, muscles, brain, or spleen after [15-3H]anthramycin administration. Gross alterations in anthramycin distribution is probably not the mechanism by which CoQ alters the cardiotoxicity and lethality of anthramycin.", 
    "47": "Repeated electrical low intensity stimulation of various regions of the brain has been shown to induce epileptic seizure activity. This experimental model of epilepsy has been used in our laboratory in rats. Male rats, anaesthetized with nembutal (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and ketalar (60 mg/kg, i.p.) were implanted stereotaxically with electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus and neocortex and received 2 hours stimulation sessions via the hippocampal electrodes (1 sec, 60 Hz, 200-800 microA) one stimulus per minute, during which electrographical and behavioral seizures were induced. The effect of anticonvulsant drugs was tested on this model: phenobarbital (40 mg/kg) reduced the quantity of epileptic electrographic activity and abolished the behavioral aspects of the seizures; diphenylhydantoin (20 mg/kg) reduced the quantity of epileptic electrographic activity, but had no effect on the behavioral component of the seizures; diazepam (6 mg/kg) only blocked the behavioral component of the seizures leaving the animal stuporous and immobile, but the electrographical component was unaffected; carbamazepine (10 mg/kg) had no effect on the electrographical epileptic seizures and reduced the behavioral aspects, but to a lesser extent than diazepam.", 
    "48": "Experimental research has shown that pirenzepina possesses interesting inhibiting properties with respect to gastric secretion and the formation of experimentally induced gastric ulcers.", 
    "49": "The transmural gastric mucosal potential difference (PD) measured by endoscopy has proved to be a good parameter in evaluating dose dependent effects of drugs. In 43 volunteers the maximum increases of the PD taken from the gastric juice were found after 30 mg pirenzepine and 0,5 and I mg atropin within 16 minutes. There was a significant difference between 20 and 30 mg pirenzepin. The dose of 20 mg pirenzepin seems to be insufficient to induce a maximum increase of PD in each individual.", 
    "50": "Twenty-two severely ill patients with multiple injuries and sepsis were treated with IV pirenzepin or placebo 3 x 10 mg per day in the frame of the double-blind study. All the patients were examined three times with endoscopy during the 14-day observation period. In 100% of cases without prophylactic treatment, stress lesions were observed, 60% of these cases had bleeding. A prophylactic IV pirenzepin application had an unmistakable protective effect regarding the stress bleeding, number and degree of stress lesions.", 
    "51": "Patients with dyspepsia were asked to volunteer for two gastric secretion tests preceded by a single intravenous injection of pirenzepine 10 mg in the one and 0.9% saline in the other (in random order). In each test gastric secretion was aspirated continuously. 0.9% saline was infused intravenously for 30 minutes followed by insulin 0.15 micrograms/kg-h for 90 minutes, saline for 30 minutes and finally pentagastrin for 90 minutes in doses of either 6, 1, 0.5 or 0.25 micrograms/kg-h. Gastric samples were analysed for volume, pH, titratable acidity and pepsin. Basal outputs of acid and pepsin were not altered by pirenzepine. Insulin-stimulated acid output was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) from a mean of 32.7 to 22.6 mmol/h (-31%). The mean percentage reduction was 16%. Acid and pepsin outputs after pentagastrin 0.25-6 micrograms/kg-h were not significantly altered by this dose of pirenzepine.", 
    "52": "A group of ten normal human volunteers participated in choice experiments comparing d-amphetamine or diazepam with placebo and with each other. Although amphetamine was preferred to placebo by most subjects, 2 mg diazepam and placebo were chosen equally. However, placebo was chosen over higher doses (5 and 10 mg) of diazepam and 5 mg d-amphetamine was preferred to 2 mg diazepam. Subjective effects were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before drug was taken and 1, 3, and 6 h later. Compared to placebo, amphetamine produced changes in mood on the POMS including increases in Vigor and Arousal. Doses of 5 and 10 mg diazepam produced decreases in Vigor and Arousal and increases in Fatigue and Confusion. The effects of diazepam were most pronounced 1 h after ingestion and appeared dose-dependent. For one subject who consistently chose diazepam, its subjective effects were similar to placebo and he stated that he could not distinguish them. These results are discussed in terms of the abuse liability of diazepam.", 
    "53": "The pharmacological properties and the equivocal antipsychotic effects of diazepam reported in the literature suggested the use of high doses of this drug on schizophrenic patients to re-evaluate its usefulness. Treatment of 15 schizophrenic patients with doses of up to 400 mg/day showed a specific effect on hallucinations and certain forms of delusion. One group (nine patients with paranoid-hallucinatory and one with schizo-affective psychosis) showed a significant reduction in psychopathology as documented in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Global Clinical Impressions (GCI), whereas five other patients (all of the schizo-affective type with symptoms of depression, euphoria, and/or psychotic anxiety) did not respond and had to be withdrawn from the study. Under the treatment an absence of sedative effects and a development of the feeling of well-being and euphoria were noticed. In three patients with doses of over 260 mg/day a marked loss of inhibitions in sexual and social behaviour was observed. It is concluded that high doses of diazepam may be useful in certain types of schizophrenia.", 
    "54": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate the IM injection of pentobarbital (5 or 10 mg/kg) from saline in a task in which 20 consecutive pecks on one of two response keys produced access to mixed grain. Pentobarbital (1.0--17.8 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in the percentage of the total session responses that occurred on the pentobarbital-appropriate key. The concomitant administration of bemegride (5.6--17.8 mg/kg) antagonized the discriminative control of behavior exerted by the training dose of pentobarbital. Benzodiazepines, diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) and clobazam (3.2 mg/kg), and barbiturates, methohexital (10 mg/kg), phenobarbital (56 mg/kg), and barbital (56 mg/kg), produced responding on the pentobarbital-appropriate key similar to that produced by pentobarbital. In contrast, narcotics such as morphine, ethylketazocine, cyclazocine, and SKF-10,047, at doses up to and including those that markedly suppressed response rates, produced responding predominantly on the saline-appropriate key. Similarly, the anticonvulsants, valproate, phenytoin, and ethosuximide occasioned only saline-appropriate behavior, indicating that not all anticonvulsants share discriminative stimulus effects with pentobarbital. Muscimol, a direct GABA agonist, and baclofen, a structural analogue of GABA, also failed to produce pentobarbital-appropriate responding. Ketamine, dextrorphan, and ethanol (0.3--3.2 g/kg, orally) produced intermediate levels of pentobarbital-appropriate responding, suggesting that the discriminative effects of these drugs may be somewhat like those of pentobarbital."
