Since drug compounds are normally polar and nonvolatile by nature, direct SPME is used in this work. The SPME extraction is an equilibrium process among the concentrations of the analyte partitioned onto the SPME fiber, free and bound drug in the solution. A calibration curve was first constructed by employing the amount of the analytes partitioned on the fiber versus the free analyte concentration in the solution in the absence of protein. In method I, the extraction was performed in the protein solution with known diazepam concentration. In method II, diazepam was first loaded onto the fiber by extracting in solution with known diazepam concentration. This fiber was subsequently transferred into the protein solution for desorption. The amount of the analyte left on the fiber was analyzed after the system reached equilibrium. The free drug concentration was then obtained from the calibration curve for both methods. The Scatchard plot was finally employed to obtain the number of binding sites and the equilibrium binding constants. Since only a very small amount of the protein solution is required (150 microL for each extraction), method II is very useful for circumstances where the protein amount is very limited. The direct measurement method proposed in this paper does not need a GC response factor, which significantly decreases the experimental error. The only measurement needed is the area count change (ratio) of the fiber injections before and after the protein was introduced into the solution. The difference between the direct measurement method for method I and method II is discussed. The result illustrated that the SPME direct measurement method provided both theoretical accuracy and simplicity in such applications.", 
    "1": "Abundant in vitro and animal model data suggest the postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABA(A)-R) is an important target for volatile general anesthetics, but the relevance of these models is untested in humans. Because benzodiazepines have also been shown to act via a specific GABA(A)-R site, they provide sensitive probes for the GABA(A)-R. Availability of the 11C-labeled benzodiazepine ligand, flumazenil, allowed us to quantitatively test in humans whether the volatile anesthetic isoflurane affects GABA(A)-Rs in vivo in a dose-dependent manner.",

Regions of interest included areas of high, intermediate, and low GABA(A)-benzodiazepine site density. For each subject and experimental condition, the binding of 11C-flumazenil, expressed as distribution volume (which linearly correlates to maximal binding site density and apparent ligand affinity), was obtained by curve fitting using a two-compartment model.", 
    "3": "The ratio of distribution volume increased significantly in each examined region during the isoflurane conditions compared with control conditions (P < 0.01, one-tailed t test). Furthermore, the increases in ratio of distribution volume during the 1.5-minimum alveolar concentration isoflurane condition were significantly greater than those measured during 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration isoflurane inhalation (P < 0.002, one-tailed t test).", 
    "4": "Isoflurane exposure appeared to enhance receptor-specific 11C-flumazenil binding in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest the possibility that a conformational change of the GABA(A)-R is involved in the mechanism of action of isoflurane in the living human brain.",

Reduced metabolism and changed distribution of anaesthetic and sedative agents can cause poor recovery. We made a prospective randomized comparison of mental function, haemodynamic stability and extubation and discharge times in elderly patients (65-79 yr) receiving two premedication, anaesthetic and sedative techniques. Patients received either propofol (n=39) (fentanyl 10-15 microg kg(-1) and propofol 2-6 mg kg(-1) intraoperatively and a propofol infusion for 3 h postoperatively) or premedication with lorazepam followed by midazolam for anaesthesia (n=39) (fentanyl 10-15 microg kg(-1) and midazolam 0.05-0.075 mg kg(-1) intraoperatively and a midazolam infusion for 3 h postoperatively). Impairment of mental function was noted in 41% of patients in the propofol group and 83% in the lorazepam and midazolam group (P=0.001) 18 h after extubation. Patients in the propofol group were extubated earlier [1.4 (SD 0.6) vs 1.9 (0.8) h, P=0.02]; and reached standard intensive care unit discharge criteria [7.6 (4.6) vs 14.2 (13) h, P=0.02] and hospital discharge criteria [4.3 (1.0) vs 4.9 (1.1) days, P=0.04) sooner than patients in the lorazepam and midazolam group, but actual discharge times did not differ between the groups. Haemodynamic values were stable in both groups.", 
    "7": "If the in vivo effects of anaesthesia are mediated through a specific receptor system, then a relationship could exist between the regional changes in brain metabolism caused by a particular agent and the underlying regional distribution of the specific receptors affected by that agent. Positron emission tomography data from volunteers studied while unconscious during propofol (n=8) or isoflurane (n=5) anaesthesia were used retrospectively to explore for evidence of relationships between regional anaesthetic effects on brain glucose metabolism and known (ex vivo) regional distribution patterns of human receptor binding sites. The regional metabolic reductions caused by propofol differed significantly from those of isoflurane. Propofol's reductions negatively correlated most significantly with the regional distribution of [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam (benzodiazepine) binding site densities (r=-0.86, P<0.0005; r=-0.79, P<0.005, respectively) and less strongly with [3H]naloxone (opioid) binding density (r=-0.69, P<0.05). Isoflurane's reductions positively correlated only with muscarinic (acetylcholine) binding density (r=0.85, P<0.05). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that some of propofol's in vivo anaesthetic effects may be mediated through a GABAergic mechanism and suggest some of isoflurane's in vivo effects might involve antagonism of central acetylcholine functioning.", 
    "8": "Both midazolam, a benzodiazepine gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor agonist, and clonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist, induce spinally-mediated analgesia. We investigated the analgesic interaction of spinally-administered midazolam and clonidine in their effects on acute and inflammatory nociception. Rats implanted with lumbar intrathecal catheters were injected intrathecally with saline (control), midazolam (1 to 100 microg), or clonidine (0.1 to 3 microg) to test for their responses to thermal stimulation to the tail (tail-flick test) and subcutaneous formalin injection into the hind paw (formalin test). The effects of the combination of midazolam and clonidine on both stimuli were tested by isobolographic analysis by using the 50% effective doses. The general behavior and motor function were examined as side effects. When combined, the 50% effective doses of midazolam (clonidine) decreased from 1.57 microg (0.26 microg) to 0.29 g (0.05 microg) in the tail-flick test and from 1.34 microg (0.12 microg) and 1.21 microg (0.13 microg) to 0.05 microg (0.005 microg) and 0.13 microg (0.015 microg) in Phase 1 and 2 of the formalin test, respectively. Side effects did not increase by using the combination.

This prospective study measured whether music can influence anxiety and perioperative sedative requirements in outpatients undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia. We also evaluated the correlation between two anxiety measures, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory test (STAI) and the 0- to 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS 0-10), with 0 meaning complete relaxation and 10 the worst feeling of anxiety possible. Fifty unpremedicated patients were randomly assigned to listen to music of their choice via headset during the perioperative period (Group I) or to have no music (Group II). All participants used patient-controlled IV midazolam sedation and underwent repeated evaluations of their anxiety level with the STAI and the VAS 0-10. Midazolam requirements during surgery (Group I, 0.6 +/- 0.7 versus Group II, 1.3 +/- 1.1 mg; P < 0.05) and for the whole perioperative period (Group I, 1.2 +/- 1.3 versus Group II, 2.5 +/- 2.0 mg; P < 0.05) were smaller in patients listening to music. Anxiety levels, measured with STAI or VAS 0-10, were similar in both groups. The Spearman's coefficient values between STAI and VAS 0-10 ranged from 0.532 to 0.687. We conclude that patients listening to music require less midazolam to achieve a similar degree of relaxation as controls and that measures of anxiety obtained from the STAI and the VAS 0-10 are positively, but only moderately, correlated.",

We tested the hypothesis that midazolam and propofol alter LV diastolic function evaluated with transmitral and tissue Doppler transthoracic echocardiography in patients with normal LV systolic function in the presence and absence of preexisting diastolic dysfunction. After IRB approval and informed consent, patients (n = 34) with normal or reversed transmitral blood flow velocity E-to-A ratios received 3 escalating doses of midazolam (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg) or propofol (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) over 10 s at 5-min intervals. Hemodynamic variables and indices of diastolic function were recorded 3 min after each dose of midazolam and propofol. Patients with diastolic dysfunction demonstrated decreased ratios of peak transmitral E-to-A wave velocity and their corresponding time-velocity integrals as compared with normal patients. Reductions in anterior and posterior mitral annulus E/A ratios were also present. Midazolam and propofol did not further alter indices of LV diastolic function in patients with impaired early LV filling. The results indicate that sedation with midazolam or propofol does not affect indices of LV diastolic performance in healthy patients and those with preexisting diastolic dysfunction.",

Midazolam was metabolized to 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1'-OH MDZ) by human liver microsomes with a Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 4.1 (1.0) (mean (SD)) micromol litre(-1) and a maximum rate of metabolism (Vmax) of 5.5 (1.1) nmol min(-1) mg protein(-1) (n = 6). Of the nine representative human liver CYP isoforms, CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 and 3A5, three (CYP2B6, 3A4 and 3A5) showed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activity, with Kms of 40.7, 1.7 and 3.0 micromol litre(-1), respectively, and Vmax values of 12.0, 3.3 and 13.2 nmol min(-1) nmol P450(-1), respectively (n = 4). Midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activity of human liver microsomes correlated significantly with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation activity, a marker of CYP3A activity (r2 = 0.77, P = 0.0001), but not with S-mephenytoin N-demethylation activity, a marker of CYP2B6 activity (r2 < 0.01, P = 0.84) (n = 11). Troleandomycin and orphenadrine, chemical inhibitors of CYP isoforms, inhibited the formation of 1'-OH MDZ by human liver microsomes. Monoclonal antibody against CYP3A4 inhibited the formation of 1'-OH MDZ by 79%, whereas monoclonal antibody against CYP2B6 had no effect on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation by human liver microsomes (n = 5). These results indicate that only CYP3A4, but not CYP2B6 or CYP2C, is involved in the metabolism of midazolam in vitro.", 
    "19": "The effects of midazolam and propofol on the contractility of fatigued canine diaphragm were examined. Diaphragmatic fatigue was induced by intermittent supramaximal bilateral electrophrenic stimulation at a frequency of 20 Hz applied for 30 min. After fatigue had been induced, group I (n=10) received no study drug, group II (n=10) was given a propofol infusion (0.1 mg kg(-1) loading dose plus 1.5 mg kg(-1) h(-1) maintenance dose) and group III (n=10) was given a midazolam infusion (0.1 mg kg(-1) loading dose plus 0.1 mg kg(-1) h(-1) maintenance dose). Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). After the fatigue-inducing period in each group, Pdi at low-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation was lower than the baseline values (P<0.05), whereas no change in Pdi at high-frequency (100 Hz) stimulation was observed. In group II, Pdi at 20 Hz stimulation was lower than fatigued values (P<0.05); Pdi at 100 Hz stimulation did not change. In group III, Pdi at both stimulation frequencies was lower than fatigued values (P<0.05). Compared with group I, Pdi at 20 Hz stimulation was lower than fatigued values (P<0.05) during administration of the study drug in groups II and III. The decrease in Pdi was greater in group III than in group II (P<0.05). In conclusion, midazolam compared with propofol is associated with an inhibitory effect on contractility in the fatigued canine diaphragm.",

A biphasic effect, that is, an initial increase of the effect variable followed by a decrease at higher concentrations, during the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness was found in EEG amplitude (both frequency bands) and in SEF95 for all anaesthetics except midazolam. There was a concentration-related decrease in BIS for all anaesthetics. There was no consistent relationship between the time of occurrence of the peak EEG effect, or the value of the EEG variable and the moment of loss of consciousness. With rapidly changing drug concentrations during the induction of anaesthesia, none of these EEG effect variables could be correlated to the moment of loss of consciousness.",

Although an oral form of midazolam is now commercially available, some practitioners continue to use the IV midazolam as an oral medication. If the injectible form of midazolam is administered orally, its bitter taste requires the use of a flavoring agent. Grapefruit juice is contraindicated for this purpose as it inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. CYP 3A4 is located in the intestine and liver. Inhibition of this cytochrome results in delayed absorption and reduced first pass effect on midazolam. This results in increased blood plasma levels of midazolam of 56% and increased midazolam bioavailability of 35%. This can result in excessive levels of sedation for the pediatric patient. Grapefruit juice is therefore contraindicated for use with oral midazolam.",

Conscious sedation among residency programs was achieved most commonly with a combination of sedative agents used with N2O. Midazolam was more popular than chloral hydrate. The oral route was the predominant route of administration. More lecture hours were spent on conscious sedation than 10 years ago. The pre-cordial stethoscope, pulse oximeter, and blood pressure cuff were the most commonly used monitors. Sedative agent and anticipated depth of sedation were the factors most often considered in choosing monitors used during the sedation of a patient. The capnograph was being used more frequently than it was 10 years ago. Programs did not report an increase in sedation emergencies but practiced emergency drills more often and had increased numbers of individuals certified in Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) or Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS).

Of the numerous drugs administered, benzodiazepines, propofol, and narcotics are the most popular. Even these proven, time-tested sedative-hypnotics and analgesics are not perfect, however, and modern intensive care demands a more ideal product. The development of dexmedetomidine, an alpha2-agonist, is an attempt to improve sedative/analgesic use and provide a drug that possesses the characteristics outlined in Table 1. It stimulates alpha2-adrenergic receptors in the locus ceruleus to provide sedation and in the spinal cord to enhance analgesia. It also causes sympatholysis via central and peripheral mechanisms. Dexmedetomidine binds alpha2-receptors eight times more avidly than clonidine and is shorter acting. It was initially evaluated as an anesthetic, but was associated with excessive bradycardia and hypertension, followed by hypotension. In late 1999, dexmedetomidine was approved for adult ICU use for less than 24 hours as a sedative infusion. It currently lacks approval in Europe. Most of the clinical experience with dexmedetomidine has been with surgical patients undergoing cardiac and vascular procedures. Careful patient selection and proper drug infusion are needed to avoid excessive deleterious hemodynamic results. Slower bolus loading over 20 minutes results in minimally decreased heart rate and blood pressure. Continuous infusion maintains unique sedation (patients appear to be asleep, but are readily roused), analgesic sparing effect, and minimal depression of respiratory drive. More experience with dexmedetomidine infusion in medical ICU patients and patients with complex end-organ dysfunction such as respiratory failure or systemic inflammatory response syndrome is needed before conclusions can be drawn about the drug's potential for wider application and its long-term (> 24 h) safety and effectiveness.",

These rules aim at early detection of either the mis-choice of dose range or a prefixed gain in the point estimate or accuracy of estimated probability of response associated with the MTD (or MED). They were compared through a simulation study under six situations that could represent the underlying unknown dose-response (either toxicity or failure) relationship, in terms of sample size, probability of correct selection and bias of the response probability associated to the MTD (or MED). Our results show that the stopping rules act correctly, with early stopping by using the two first rules based on the posterior distribution when the actual underlying dose-response relationship is far from that initially supposed, while the rules based on predictive gain functions provide a discontinuation of inclusions whatever the actual dose-response curve after 20 patients on average, that is, depending mostly on the accumulated data. The stopping rules were then applied to a data set from a dose-ranging phase II clinical trial aiming at estimating the MED dose of midazolam in the sedation of infants during cardiac catheterization. All these findings suggest the early use of the two first rules to detect a mis-choice of dose range, while they confirm the requirement of including at least 20 patients at the same dose to reach an accurate estimate of MTD (MED).

After long-term therapy with clonazepam, all patients with idiopathic downbeat nystagmus experienced elimination of oscillopsia, relief of diplopia, and improvement of visual acuity. Although temporary relief of downbeat nystagmus was observed 1 hour after the clonazepam test, downbeat nystagmus was not eliminated permanently.",

The midazolam group had significantly better sedation from 18-24 hours after enrollment compared to placebo group. At 48 h there were no significant differences in proportion of infants with adequate sedation between midazolam and placebo group. The two groups were comparable with respect to heart rate, perfusion, ventilatory indices and blood gas parameters.

    "55": "The aim of the present study was to characterize the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes present in the caput and cauda of rat epididymis. The specific binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to epididymal membranes was time dependent, temperature dependent, and saturable. The cauda epididymis showed higher affinity to [3H]QNB and higher muscarinic receptor density when compared to the caput region. The [3H]QNB binding was tested in competition studies with different muscarinic receptor antagonists. Each antagonist tested displaced [3H]QNB bound to caput and cauda epididymal membrane with similar affinity. Correlation among the negative logarithm of inhibition constant values (pK(i)) for these antagonists obtained in the epididymis with their correspondent published pK(i) values obtained in tissues that expressed each receptor subtype (M1, M2, M3, and M4) indicated that the muscarinic receptors present in caput and cauda epididymis belong to the muscarinic M2 receptor subtype. When reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to identify muscarinic receptor mRNA subtypes in the epididymis, only m2 transcripts were detected in the caput region, while both m2 and m3 mRNA subtypes were observed in the cauda region. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that muscarinic receptors are present in the rat epididymis, with expression levels dependent on the region of the epididymis analyzed. Thus, the cholinergic neurotransmitter in the epididymis may be a factor controlling contractility and/or the luminal fluid microenvironment.", 
    "56": "The objective of this study is to describe a urine drug-testing program implemented for parents with a history of substance abuse by family service agencies in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Nurse collectors went to the parents' home to obtain urine specimens under direct observation and then delivered the specimens to the toxicology laboratory or arranged shipment by courier under chain of custody. Each urine specimen was screened for cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite, opiates, amphetamines and benzodiazepines, ethyl alcohol and creatinine. All positive screening tests were confirmed by another method such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In 15,979 urine specimens collected from 1994 to 1999, the percent positive rate for one (or more) drugs/metabolites ranged from 45.6% (1994-1996) to 30.0% (1998, 1999). A total of 575 specimens (3.7%) were dilute (urine creatinine <25mg/dl). Positive rates in 15,404 non-dilute specimens from 1994 to 1999 were as follows: cannabinoids - 11.7%, benzodiazepines - 11.3%, cocaine metabolite - 3.7%, and ethyl alcohol - 2.6%. Most clients provided less than 20 urine specimens for testing but some individuals submitted urine specimens more than 100 times in a 12-15-month period. Urine drug screening in parents with a history of substance abuse provided an objective and reliable indication of recent drug use in this population.", 
    "57": "Anxiolytic benzodiazepines, at low doses, reportedly impair the radial arm maze with nonspatial visual/tactile but not spatial cues. We replicated the former result controlling for changes in drug state and cue effectiveness. Rats learned an eight-arm radial maze with reward in only four arms. The reward varied in spatial position from trial to trial but was always cued by a piece of sandpaper at the entry to the arm. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, ip) impaired acquisition. Rats that switched from saline during acquisition to chlordiazepoxide showed an impairment of performance that only lasted for 1 day. Removal of the cues reduced the performance of controls and switched rats to the level of the rats that received chlordiazepoxide during acquisition but did not affect the latter. These data suggest that chlordiazepoxide does indeed impair nonspatial reference memory in the radial arm maze while leaving working memory, and, possibly, spatial reference memory, intact but that the previous report of this effect was the result of a change in drug state rather than of the drug itself.", 
    "58": "Previous reports indicate that the behavioural effects (including anxiolytic-like actions, hypothermia, \"serotonergic syndrome,\" maternal behaviour and aggression and reduction in ambulation) of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), are completely blocked in lactating rats. The present study compares the behavioural effects of buspirone (1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg) between ovariectomized and mid-lactating rats. The study was carried out on Wistar female rats under inverted light/dark cycle conditions, by using the burying behaviour paradigm, the elevated plus maze and a general activity test. In both ovariectomized and lactating rats, diazepam produced a dose-dependent reduction in burying behaviour and an increase in the time spent in open arms, responses interpreted as anxiolytic. Buspirone at all doses (1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) produced clear motor impairments in lactating, but not in ovariectomized animals, indicating that the effects of this drug on the anxiety paradigms are unspecific. Diazepam, by contrast, at the highest dose (4.0 mg/kg) similarly inhibited ambulation in both conditions. In the elevated plus maze, control lactating subjects spent more time in the open arms compared with saline-treated ovariectomized subjects, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect of lactation per se. The present results support the idea that some behavioural actions of drugs acting at the serotonergic system vary between ovariectomized and lactating rats.", 
    "59": "GABA(A) receptor binding after repeated cocaine has been shown to be either increased as indicated by benzodiazepine binding or decreased as indicated by convulsant-site binding. We measured the GABA binding site with [3H]-muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors and found no differences between saline- and cocaine-sensitized rats. Allosteric modulation of [3H]-muscimol binding with flunitrazepam was also unchanged after cocaine sensitization. In addition, [3H]-flunitrazepam binding and allosteric modulation of [3H]-flunitrazepam binding with GABA was unchanged after 1 day withdrawal from repeated cocaine. GABA(A) receptor function and allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptor function measured by GABA-stimulated Cl(-) uptake was also unchanged after withdrawal from repeated cocaine. Finally, in vitro cocaine reduced GABA(A) receptor function in striatal microsacs of saline- and cocaine-treated rats. In conclusion, repeated cocaine did not change the coupling of the GABA(A) receptor between the GABA and benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site after 1 day withdrawal.", 
    "60": "Pagoclone is a cyclopyrrolone that is believed to act as a partial agonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A/benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor. In theory, such partial agonists should be anxiolytic but lack the adverse side-effects of sedation, tolerance and withdrawal associated with full GABA-A/BDZ agonists. The objective of the randomized double-blind crossover study was to assess whether pagoclone was an effective anti-panic agent and also to assess its side-effect profile. Patients recruited had a diagnosis of Panic Disorder (DSM-IV) with at least one panic attack per week. Following a 2-week screening period, patients entered a 6-week trial consisting of two 2-week treatment periods, each followed by a 1-week washout. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pagoclone 0.1 mg t.d.s. or placebo on their first treatment period and the converse on their second. The primary measure was daily panic attack dairy. Fourteen patients completed the study, the mean number of panic attacks during screening was 5.8+/-0.8 (SEM), this fell to 3.6+/-0.5 during treatment with pagoclone (p = 0.05) and 4.3+/-0.8 with placebo (p = 0.14). There was no significant difference on direct comparison of pagoclone with placebo or in any of the secondary measures (including Rickels withdrawal scale) or the adverse event profiles. The study provides preliminary evidence that pagoclone has anxiolytic properties in the absence of typical BDZ side-effects. This is consistent with its theoretical mode of action as a partial agonist at the GABA(A)/BDZ receptor.", 
    "61": "The effects of flumazenil, Ro 154513 and beta-CCM in the staircase test were studied in control and small platform (SP) stressed mice. SP stress was induced by placing mice on small platforms (3.5 cm in diameter) surrounded by water for 24 h. This model contains several factors of stress, such as rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, isolation, immobilization and falling into the water. The staircase test consisted of placing a mouse in an enclosed staircase with five steps and recording: (i) the number of rearings and (ii) steps made during 3 min. SP stress increased the exploratory activity of mice in the staircase test as demonstrated by an increase in the number of rearings and steps made. In control mice flumazenil (2.0 and 10.0 mg/kg), Ro 15-4513 (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) and beta-CCM (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) exerted an anxiogenic effect that was demonstrated by an increase in the number of rearings without significant changes in the number of steps. Similar to control mice, flumazenil induced an anxiogenic effect in SP stressed mice as demonstrated by an increase in the number of rearings. However, the sedative effect of flumazenil as demonstrated by a decrease in the number of steps made was more pronounced in SP stressed mice. In the SP stressed mice, the anxiogenic effect of Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM was masked by their strong sedative effect and a decrease in both measures of exploratory activity (number of rearings and number of steps). These data suggest that SP stress induces hypersensitivity to the sedative effect of flumazenil, Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM in the staircase test.", 
    "62": "The release of [(3)H]acetylcholine evoked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and its inhibition mediated by GABA(A) and glycine receptors were studied in superfused cultured rat embryo spinal cord motoneurons prelabeled with [(3)H]choline. AMPA elicited tritium release, possibly representing [(3)H]acetylcholine release in a concentration-dependent manner. The release was external Ca(2+)-dependent and was sensitive to Cd(2+) ions, omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-conotoxin MVIIC, but not to nifedipine, suggesting the involvement of N-, P/Q-, but not L-type Ca(2+) channels. The AMPA effect was insensitive to tetrodotoxin. The glutamate receptors involved are AMPA type since the AMPA-evoked [(3)H]acetylcholine release was blocked by LY303070 and was potentiated by the antidesensitizing agent cyclothiazide. Muscimol inhibited completely the AMPA effect on [(3)H]acetylcholine release; muscimol was potentiated by diazepam and antagonized by SR95531, indicating the involvement of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors. Glycine, acting at strychnine-sensitive receptors, also inhibited the effect of AMPA, but only in part. The inhibitory effects of muscimol and glycine are additive. We conclude that glutamate can act at AMPA receptors sited on spinal motoneurons to evoke release of acetylcholine. GABA and glycine, possibly released as cotransmitters from spinal interneurons, inhibit glutamate-evoked acetylcholine release by activating GABA(A) and glycine receptors on motoneurons.", 
    "63": "The protective effects of drugs acting at the benzodiazepine receptors against ethanol-induced gastric damage were investigated using a newly developed in vitro model of the ethanol-induced gastric damage. The rat stomachs were isolated from the whole animal and kept in Kreb's solution at 37 degrees C. Gastric damage was induced by administration of 1 mL of 50% V/V ethanol into the isolated rat stomach. Administration of the benzodiazepine agonist, clonazepam (25, 50, 100 microg), or the partial benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro15-4513 (50 or 100 microg), significantly protected against ethanol-induced gastric damage when these agents were administered 15 min before ethanol. The protective effects of these drugs were blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (200-400 microg). Flumazenil alone was found to aggravate ethanol-induced gastric damage (200-400 microg). The results of this study give evidence for the involvement of central-type benzodiazepine receptors located in the stomach in the protective action of benzodiazepines against ethanol-induced gastric damage.", 
    "64": "Olanzapine is a relatively new antipsychotic drug used in the United States for the treatment of schizophrenia. Since its release in the United States market in 1996, few cases of fatal acute intoxication have been reported in the literature. This article describes the case of a 25-year-old man found dead at home who had been prescribed olanzapine for schizophrenia. This case is unique because of the measurement of olanzapine in brain tissue obtained from seven regions in addition to the commonly collected biologic matrices. Olanzapine was detected and quantitated by basic liquid-liquid extraction followed by dual-column gas chromatographic analysis with nitrogen phosphorus detection. The assay had a limit of detection of 0.05 mg/L and an upper limit of linearity of 2 mg/L. The presence of olanzapine was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry by use of electron impact ionization. The concentrations of olanzapine measured in this case were as follows (mg/L or mg/kg): 0.40 (heart blood), 0.27 (carotid blood), 0.35 (urine), 0.61 (liver), negative (cerebrospinal fluid), 0.33 mg in 50 ml (gastric contents). In the brain, the following distribution of olanzapine was determined (mg/kg): negative (cerebellum), 0.22 (hippocampus), 0.86 (midbrain), 0.16 (amygdala), 0.39 (caudate/putamen), 0.17 (left frontal cortex), and 0.37 (right frontal cortex). The cause of death was determined to be acute intoxication by olanzapine, and the manner of death was accidental.", 
    "65": "The goal in this study was to assess if there is any constancy in detections of psychoactive substances in consecutive suicides. Toxicologic findings in 179 suicides in San Diego County, California, between 1981 and 1982, and 333 suicides in Mobile County, Alabama, between 1990 and 1998, were compared. Alcohol was detected in about 30% of suicides in both samples. Abusable prescription psychoactive substances, i.e., benzodiazepines and opiates, were detected in one fifth of cases in both locations. Nonabusable prescription psychoactive substances, mainly antidepressants, were found in more suicides in Mobile than in San Diego. Detection rates of different classes of psychoactive substances have not changed much in the past decade. Detection of alcohol, cocaine, or cannabis in about 40% of suicides supports the clinical practice of discouraging consumption of these substances in depressed patients. Another challenge is the low rate of detection of antidepressants in suicide, which suggests undertreatment of depression in suicides. Continued reporting of routine, comprehensive, toxicologic findings in suicides is useful to monitor patterns of use of psychoactive substances in this group and to guide suicide prevention in clinical practice and public health policy.", 
    "66": "Midazolam was administered intravenously to 8 bitches in a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial before propofol induction of surgical anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane-in-oxygen during surgical endoscopic examination of the uterus and ovariohysterectomy. Clenbuterol was administered at the start of surgery to improve uterine muscle relaxation, and to facilitate endoscopic examination of the uterus. Ventilation was controlled. Induction of anaesthesia with propofol to obtain loss of the pedal reflex resulted in a statistically significant (P < 0.05) decrease in minute volume and arterial oxygen partial pressure in the midazolam group. Apnoea also occurred in 50% of dogs in the midazolam group. The dose for propofol in the midazolam group was 7.4 mg/kg compared to 9.5 mg/kg in the control. Minute volume was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in both groups during isoflurane maintenance, compared to the value after incremental propofol to obtain loss of the pedal reflex. Propofol induction resulted in a 25-26% reduction in the mean arterial blood pressure in both groups, and the administration of clenbuterol at the start of surgery resulted in a transient, but statistically significant (P < 0.05), decrease in mean arterial blood pressure in the midazolam group during isoflurane anaesthesia. It is concluded that intravenous midazolam premedication did not adversely affect cardiovascular function during propofol induction, but intra-operative clenbuterol during isoflurane maintenance of anaesthesia may result in transient hypotension. Midazolam premedication may increase adverse respiratory effects when administered before propofol induction of anaesthesia.", 
    "67": "The glutamate receptor system is implicated in the development and maintenance of epileptic seizures, and animal studies have disclosed potent anticonvulsant activity of a number of inhibitors of AMPA and/or kainate (KA) receptor activity. These results make such inhibitors potential future antiepileptic drugs. Different series of compounds with inhibitory activity towards AMPA receptors have been developed. Most of these inhibitors are structurally derived from AMPA, quinoxalinedione or 2,3-benzodiazepine. In contrast, only a limited number of inhibitors of KA receptor activity have been developed, most of which contain quinoxalinedione or decahydroisoquinoline skeletons. In spite of promising anticonvulsant activity in various animal model studies, no AMPA/KA receptor inhibitors are in clinical use against epilepsy today. Based on molecular biology studies, AMPA and KA receptors are at present divided into four and five subtypes, respectively, and attempts to develop subtype selective compounds have been initiated. Future studies and development of such compounds will indicate whether AMPA/KA receptor inhibition is a feasible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of epilepsy.", 
    "68": "Prominent theories of implicit memory (D. Schacter, B. Church, & J. Treadwell, 1994) emphasize the dominant role of perceptual processing in mediating priming on perceptual implicit memory tests. Examinations of the effects of conceptual processing on perceptual implicit memory tests have produced ambiguous results. Although a number of investigations (e.g., J. Toth & R. Hunt, 1990) have demonstrated that variations in conceptual processing affect priming on perceptual implicit memory tests, these effects may arise because of the contaminating effects of explicit memory. The current experiment examined this controversy using midazolam, a benzodiazepine that produces a dense, albeit temporary, anterograde amnesia when injected prior to study. The experiment examined whether the effects of generation found on the implicit memory test of perceptual identification were affected by a midazolam injection prior to study. Results demonstrated that midazolam substantially diminished generation effects in free and cued recall, as well as overall performance on these tests, but had no detectable effect on the generation effect in perceptual identification.",

We have previously synthesized PBR ligand-gemcitabine conjugates based on the model PBR ligand, PK11195.

Based on these findings and the favorable chemical stability of GG01, here referred as PK11195-GEM, pharmacokinetic investigations of PK11195-GEM and GEM were conducted in male rats. These studies consisted of single-dose and steady-state dosing regimen studies, the latter to assess drug distribution in normal brain and brain tumors. PK11195-GEM and GEM were measured in blood and tissue samples by HPLC.", 
    "71": "All PBR-GEM conjugates demonstrated appreciable receptor binding affinity and cytotoxicity with mean IC50 values ranging from 248 to 376 nM and 5.6 to 29.1 nM, respectively. The cytotoxicity of GEM was comparable with a mean IC50 value of 5.9 nM. Following administration of single 8 mg/kg doses of PK11195-GEM to rats (n=4), PK11195-GEM had a mean total clearance of 126.3 +/- 29.6 ml/min per kg, and a volume of distribution at steady-state of 1,261.9 +/- 31.05 ml/kg that resulted in a very short elimination half-life of 16.1 +/- 5.8 min. In comparison GEM had a similar volume of distribution (993.8 +/- 131.6 ml/kg), reduced clearance (3.4 +/- 0.8 ml/ min per kg), and longer half-life (235.6 +/- 26.7 min). In nude rats bearing intracerebral tumors, mean steady-state tumor/plasma, tumor/right brain, and tumor/left brain PK 11195-GEM concentration ratios were 1.75 +/- 0.46, 5.49 +/- 5.2, and 9.96 +/- 3.2, respectively. The analogous values following GEM administrations were 0.81 0.5, 3.67 1.57, and 5.21 +/- 1.95, respectively. These values indicate a minimum twofold increase in tumor target selectivity for the conjugate delivery system compared to GEM treatment.", 
    "72": "Targeting intracellular PBRs is a new drug delivery strategy based on the use of low molecular weight drug conjugates that can be administered systemically. It was demonstrated under steady-state conditions that PK11195-GEM possessed a twofold enhancement in brain tumor selectivity compared to GEM alone. This type of target selectivity would allow higher tumor concentrations to be achieved in conjunction with lower drug concentrations in normal or non-target tissues.", 
    "73": "The receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAFR) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. According to the allosteric ternary complex model, GPCRs exist in an equilibrium between different conformations. Agonist binding promotes and stabilizes the receptor in an active conformation. On the other hand, ligands that stabilize the inactive conformation are known as inverse agonists. Due to the association of platelet-activating factor (PAF) with diverse physiological and pathological processes, considerable efforts have been invested in the development of antagonists to PAFR. A large number of these molecules has been shown to specifically interact with PAFR but, surprisingly, little is known about their impact on the conformation of the receptor and its activity. By using a constitutively active mutant (L231R) of the human PAFR and by transiently coexpressing the wild-type (WT) receptor with the G(alpha)q subunit of the trimeric G protein, we were able to address this issue with ligands of diverse structures such as phospholipids, benzodiazepines, furans, and others. We demonstrated that some of these molecules are potent inverse agonists. For example, when cells (WT PAFR + G(alpha)q) were exposed to WEB2086, SM10661, or alprazolam, the basal inositol phosphate production was reduced by 53 +/- 6, 44 +/- 3, and 54 +/- 4%, respectively. The decrease in basal inositol phosphate production by WEB2086 was significantly inhibited by a more neutral antagonist BN52021, confirming the specificity of the reaction. We demonstrate here that WEB2086 and other known ligands previously considered as antagonists can act as inverse agonists on the human PAF receptor.", 
    "74": "We investigated the quantitative prediction of human hepatic metabolic clearance from in vitro experiments focusing on cytochrome P450 metabolism with eight model compounds, FK1052, FK480, zolpidem, omeprazole, nicardipine, nilvadipine, diazepam, and diltiazem. For the compounds, in vivo human hepatic extraction ratios ranged widely from 0.03 to 0.87. In vitro and in vivo hepatic intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) values for each compound were measured and calculated in rats and/or dogs and humans. CL(int,in vitro) was determined from a substrate disappearance rate at 1 microM in hepatic microsomes, which was a useful method. CL(int,in vivo) was calculated from in vivo pharmacokinetic data using three frequent mathematical models (the well stirred, parallel-tube, and dispersion models). The human scaling factor values (CL(int,in vivo)/CL(int,in vitro)) showed marked difference among the model compounds (0.3-26.6-fold). On the other hand, most of the animal scaling factors were within 2-fold of the values in humans, suggesting that scaling factor values were similar in the different animal species. When human CL(int,in vitro) values were compared with the actual CL(int,in vivo), correlation was not necessarily good. By contrast, using human CL(int,in vitro) corrected with the rat and/or dog scaling factors yielded better predictions of CL(int,in vivo) that were mostly within 2-fold of the actual values. Furthermore, successful predictions of human CL(oral) and hepatic extraction ratio (E(H)) were obtained by use of the human CL(int,in vitro) corrected with animal scaling factors. The new variant method is a simple one, incorporating additional information from animal studies and providing a more reliable prediction of human hepatic clearance.", 
    "75": "Diazepam is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in the liver. CYP2C19 shows genetic polymorphism associated with the poor metabolizer (PM) and extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotypes. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of diltiazem, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, on pharmacokinetics and dynamics of diazepam in relation to CYP2C19 genotype status. Thirteen healthy volunteers (eight EMs and five PMs) were given placebo or diltiazem (200 mg) orally for 3 days before and for 7 days after the oral 2-mg dose of diazepam in a double-blind, randomized, crossover manner. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diazepam were assessed with and without diltiazem. Plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam were significantly greater in the PM compared with the EM group during the placebo phase. Diltiazem significantly increased AUC and prolonged elimination t(1/2) of diazepam in both the PM and EM groups. These pharmacokinetic changes, however, caused no significant difference in the pharmacodynamics between the two trial phases. Diltiazem affects the pharmacokinetics of diazepam in the PM and EM groups of CYP2C19. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by a concomitant substrate drug like diltiazem may cause a pharmacokinetic interaction with diazepam irrespective of CYP2C19 genotype status, but whether this interaction would reflect a pharmacodynamic change of diazepam remains unconfirmed by our study.", 
    "76": "A 34-year-old woman with a history of renal insufficiency induced by long-term cocaine use was admitted with acute shortness of breath remarkable for submandibular and anterior throat swelling. She required intubation, mechanical ventilation, and sedation. Sedation was administered with daily infusions of intravenous lorazepam 65, 313, and 305 mg for 3 days, respectively. Forty-eight hours into the infusion the patient experienced anion gap metabolic acidosis with hyperlactatemia, hyperosmolality, and increased osmolal gap. Propylene glycol (PG), a component of lorazepam intravenous formulation, was considered the potential source of the metabolic abnormality. The patient received greater than 40 times the acceptable recommended amount of PG over 72 hours. Cessation of lorazepam produced major improvements in lactic acid, serum osmolality, and anion and osmolal gaps. The large PG exposure associated with long-term cocaine-induced renal insufficiency produced a toxic metabolic state. Agents containing PG should be avoided in patients with compromised renal function (creatinine clearance < or = 30 ml/min) induced by cocaine use.", 
    "77": "The aim of this study was to cross-validate the Benzodiazepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ), which reflects the severity of benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence. The Bendep-SRQ, Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) Schedules for Clinical Assessments in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), and Addiction Severity Index-Revised (ASI-R) were administered to 102 general practice (GP) patients and 126 psychiatric outpatients who were using BZDs. The scalability and reliability of the Bendep-SRQ scales were reassessed in terms of Rasch homogeneity, subject discriminability, item discriminability, and test-retest stability. Present and original Rasch item orders were compared to evaluate construct validity. A matrix of all measures was factor-analyzed to assess concurrent and discriminant validity. The scalability of the Bendep-SRQ scales was confirmed. The reliability results were fairly good. Present and original Rasch item orders corresponded. The Bendep-SRQ scales and concurrent measures had high loadings on one factor, the discriminant measures on two other factors. In spite of some differences with respect to sociodemographic characteristics and pattern of BZD use, the cross-validation results agreed well with the results of the original study on the Bendep-SRQ. The Bendep-SRQ has presently acquired enough support of favorable and consistent results for clinical and scientific use.", 
    "78": "The aim of the present study was to obtain standardized scores that correspond with the raw scores on the four Rasch scales of the Benzodiazepine Dependence-Self Report Questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ). The eligible normative group for standardization of the Bendep-SRQ scales consisted of 217 general practice (GP) patients, all using benzodiazepines. Two standardization methods were used and compared: \"classical standardization,\" which transforms raw scores into standard scores on the unit normal distribution, and \"latent trait standardization,\" which transforms raw scores into latent trait scores. The latter requires the Rasch model with the additional assumption of a normally distributed latent trait, which held true for the scales \"problematic use,\" \"lack of compliance,\" and \"withdrawal,\" but not for \"preoccupation.\" The observed unequal item spacing on the \"preoccupation\" scale was hypothesized to induce a response tendency of nondeviation, causing a local violation of the assumption of a normally distributed latent trait. Nevertheless, comparison of the results of the two standardization methods revealed such a high degree of resemblance, that latent trait standardization could be used for \"preoccupation\" just as well as classical standardization. The presented standard scores and corresponding percentile ranks make raw Bendep-SRQ scores clinically interpretable in relation to the normative GP sample. Incorporation of the Rasch scaling methodology into the development of the Bendep-SRQ marks the adoption of the item response theory in the field of applied test methodology. In this process, it appears that equal item spacing has to be taken into account to prevent local violations of the Rasch model with the additional assumption of a normally distributed latent trait.", 
    "79": "The analgesic effect of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker ketamine in 17 patients (13 females and four males, age 32-88 years) who had suffered neuropathic orofacial pain for time periods ranging from 6 months to 28 years was examined. The patients were given an i.m. test-dose of 0.4 mg/kg ketamine combined with 0.05 mg/kg midazolam. Four patients did not experience any analgesic effect of the i.m. test dose. The remaining 13 patients experienced an analgesic effect which lasted for less than 1 h (transient effect) in seven and for several hours (long-term effect) in six. One week later they were given 4 mg/kg ketamine to be taken orally in combination with a hypnotic drug for three consecutive nights. All patients who reported a long-term analgesic effect after i.m. ketamine also reported reduced pain intensity on days after taking ketamine at night. The findings of this open study are in accord with the results from a previous double-blind randomized investigation. In order to evaluate the role of age and pain duration for the analgesic effect of ketamine, we pooled the data from the two studies and performed a correlation analysis of 43 patients. We found a positive correlation between a long pain-history and lack of analgesic effect and also between a short pain-history and a long-term analgesic effect of low-dose ketamine. The apparent relationship between patient age and ketamine response was, however, not statistically significant. Further, patients with pain following a nerve lesion and patients without a known lesion of peripheral nerves were equally distributed between the three response groups. These results indicate that pain mechanisms are subject to alterations with time and that these alterations involve transition from NMDA to non-NMDA receptor mediated transmission in central pain pathways.", 
    "80": "The effect of alkylpyrazine derivatives on pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, picrotoxicin-induced convulsion and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in mouse brain were studied. The duration of pentobarbital-induced sleep in mice was dose-dependently increased by 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (DMP). The duration of pentobarbital-induced sleep was also increased by an administration route of intracerebroventricular injection. Sleep duration was also increased by the administration of isomers of DMP, 2-chloro-3,6-dimethylpyrazine (DMP-Cl) and 2-fluoro-3,6-dimethylpyrazine (DMP-F), but 3,6-dimethylpyrazine-2-thiol (DMP-SH) did not affect sleep duration. The interval until the appearance of picrotoxicin-induced convulsion was prolonged by DMP and DMP-Cl. Increased sleep duration was obtained by administering DMP in combination with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) and diazepam compared to a single injection. The interval until convulsion due to picrotoxin was also prolonged by the administration of DMP combined with diazepam and valproic acid (VPA). The interval until the appearance of bicuculline-induced convulsion was also prolonged by pretreatment with DMP. The GABA level in mouse brain was increased by the administration of AOAA, VPA, DMP and DMP-Cl. These results suggest that DMP and other derivatives may strengthen the GABAnergic system in the brain.",

    "82": "We examined the role of CCK-A receptors in acid inhibition by intestinal nutrients. Gastric acid and plasma CCK and gastrin levels were measured in rats with gastric and duodenal fistulas during intragastric 8% peptone and duodenal perfusion with saline, complete liquid diet (CLD; 20% carbohydrate, 6% fat, and 5% protein), and the individual components of CLD. Acid output was significantly inhibited (50-60%) by CLD, lipid, and dextrose. Plasma CCK was significantly increased by CLD (from 2.6 +/- 0.3 to 4.8 +/- 0.5 pM) and lipid (4.6 +/- 0.5 pM). CCK levels 50-fold higher (218 +/- 33 pM) were required to achieve similar acid inhibition by exogenous CCK-8 (10 nmol x kg(-1) x h(-1) iv). Intestinal soybean trypsin inhibitor elevated CCK (10.9 +/- 2.5 pM) without inhibiting acid secretion. The CCK-A antagonist MK-329 (1 mg/kg iv) reversed acid inhibition caused by CLD, lipid, and dextrose. Peptone-stimulated gastrin (21.7 +/- 1.9 pM) was significantly inhibited by CLD (14.5 +/- 3.6 pM), lipid (12.3 +/- 2.2 pM), and dextrose (11.9 +/- 1.5 pM). Lipid and carbohydrate inhibit acid secretion by activating CCK-A receptors but not by altering plasma CCK concentrations.", 
    "83": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the effect of dietary lipid on proximal gastrointestinal function and satiety is controversial. Recent work suggests that fatty acid chain length may be a determining factor. We investigated the mechanism by which long- and short-chain fatty acids activate jejunal afferent nerves in rats. Whole mesenteric afferent nerve discharge was recorded in anaesthetized male Wistar rats during luminal perfusion of saline, sodium oleate, and sodium butyrate (both 10 mM). Both fatty acids evoked characteristic afferent nerve responses, distinct from the mechanical response to saline, that were abolished in rats following chronic subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. The effect of oleate was abolished by the CCK-A receptor antagonist Devazepide (0.5 mg/kg), whereas the effect of butyrate persisted despite pretreatment with either Devazepide or a combination of the calcium channel inhibitors nifedipine (1 mg/kg) and the omega-conotoxins GVIA and SVIB (each 25 microg/kg). In summary, long- and short-chain fatty acids activate intestinal vagal afferents by different mechanisms; oleate acts via a CCK-mediated mechanism and butyrate appears to have a direct effect on afferent terminals.", 
    "84": "A new class of N,N-diethyl-(2-arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamides (3f-y), as azaisosters of Alpidem, was prepared following a novel synthetic method and their affinities for both the peripheral (PBR) and the central (CBR) benzodiazepine receptors were evaluated. Binding assays were carried out using both [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 as radioligands for PBR, whereas [3H]Ro 15-1788 was used for CBR, in rat kidney and rat cortex, respectively. The tested compounds exhibited a broad range of binding affinities from as low as 0.76 nM to inactivity and most of them proved to be high selective ligands for PBR. The preliminary SAR studies suggested some of the structural features required for high affinity and selectivity; particularly the substituents on the pyrimidine moiety seemed to play an important role in PBR versus CBR selectivity. A subset of the highest affinity compounds was also tested for their ability to stimulate steroid biosynthesis in C6 glioma rat cells and some of these were found to increase pregnenolone formation with potency similar to Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195.", 
    "85": "The selective, non-peptidergic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)(1) receptor antagonists, CP154,526 and DMP695, dose-dependently increased punished responses of rats in a Vogel conflict test and enhanced social interaction (SI) of rats in an unfamiliar environment. They were, however, inactive in a plus-maze procedure and failed to reduce ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) associated with an aversive environment. In contrast, the benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, was effective in all these procedures. Further, the serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist, flesinoxan, was active in each paradigm (except the plus-maze) while the 5-HT(2C) antagonist, SB242,084, was effective in the SI and Vogel but not the plus-maze and USV procedures. In contrast to chlordiazepoxide, flesinoxan and SB242,084, CP154,526 did not modify dialysate levels of 5-HT, norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) in the frontal cortex (FCX) of freely moving rats. In conclusion, CP154,526 and DMP695 possess a common and distinctive profile of anxiolytic action expressed in the absence of an intrinsic influence upon monoamine release.", 
    "86": "The endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone has recently been demonstrated to have somnogenic properties that are very similar to those of other agonistic modulators of GABA(A) receptors, especially of short-acting benzodiazepines. Short-acting benzodiazepines are established to rapidly lose their hypnotic effect upon repeated administration. To investigate the tolerance potential of allopregnanolone, we assessed sleep-wake behavior in rats during subchronic treatment (once daily for five days) with placebo or 15 mg/kg allopregnanolone (n = 8 each). The sleep patterns of the placebo and allopregnanolone group did not differ significantly before and after treatment. Throughout the entire treatment period the allopregnanolone group exhibited shorter non-rapid eye movement sleep (non-REMS) latencies, prolonged REMS latencies, longer non-REMS episodes, more pre-REMS and less low-frequency, but higher spindle activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-REMS than the placebo group. The lack of tolerance effects suggests that allopregnanolone may be an efficacious modulator of sleep-wake behavior over longer time periods than most drugs targeting the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "87": "The mechanism of action of both typical antipsychotics and the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, may be related to the (changing) interaction of dopamine and serotonin in schizophrenia. This study examined the effect of olanzapine in schizophrenic patients on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites of dopamine (homovanillic acid, HVA) and serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA). Twenty-three male schizophrenic patients, who were drug-free for at least 2 weeks (mean drug-free period of 35 days +/- 43; median 16 days), underwent a lumbar puncture (LP). Patients were subsequently treated with olanzapine 10 mg/day for 6 weeks, after which the LP was repeated. CSF was assayed for HVA and 5-HIAA concentrations. Psychiatric symptoms were rated once a week. Olanzapine significantly increased HVA concentrations and the HVA/5-HIAA ratio while 5-HIAA concentrations were not altered. These changes did not significantly correlate with treatment response. A negative correlation was found between HVA concentrations and negative symptoms after olanzapine treatment. In conclusion, olanzapine treatment increases HVA concentrations and the HVA/5-HIAA ratio in CSF of schizophrenic patients, but these changes are unrelated to its clinical efficacy.", 
    "88": "Authors evaluated two forms of antiemetic therapy in 129 courses of 51 gynecological cancer patients treated with cisplatin chemotherapy of moderately or highly emetic dose (50-100 mg/m2) in a prospective, non randomized study.

An additional anxiolytic drug (alprazolam or meprobamate or diazepam) or droperidol with known sedative characteristics (1 ml, intravenously) was given in the combination of the group B. 80.3% and 73.5% complete responses were achieved in groups A and B, respectively (p = 0.4084). No differences were found in the side effects of the two antiemetic combinations. Authors conclude the addition of an anxiolytic drug does not improve the antiemetic effectivity of the granisetron-methylprednisolone combination in the first 24 hours of cisplatin chemotherapy.", 
    "89": "A recent report showed that zolpidem (CAS 82626-48-0) can lead to the arousal of a semi-comatosed patient. Zolpidem is clinically used for the treatment of insomnia. It belongs to the imidazopyridine chemical class and is a non benzodiazepine drug. It illicits its pharmacological action via the GABA receptor system through stimulation of particularly the omega 1 receptors. In this study, the effect of zolpidem on brain perfusion was examined by 99mTc hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (HMPAO) split dose brain SPECT on four normal baboons and in one baboon with abnormal neurological behaviour. The global and regional brain perfusion was not significantly affected in the normal brains. In some regions of the abnormal baboon brain, however, there was a disproportionate increase in perfusion after zolpidem.", 
    "90": "Hydroxychloroquine overdoses are rarely reported with 7 previous cases found in the English medical literature. We report a case and review the literature. A 16-year-old girl ingested a handful of hydroxychloroquine 200mg, 30 minutes before presentation and presented with tachycardia (heart rate 110 beats/min), hypotension (systolic blood pressure 63 mm Hg), central nervous system depression, conduction defects (QRS = 0.14 msec), and hypokalemia (K = 2.1 meq/L). She was treated with fluid boluses and dopamine, oxygen, and potassium supplementation. Toxicologic tests confirmed the presence of hydroxychloroquine. The patient's hypotension resolved within 4.5 hours, serum potassium stabilized in 24 hours, and tachycardia gradually decreased over 3 days. Although hydroxychloroquine overdoses are very rare, life-threatening hypotension, conduction problems, and hypokalemia can occur within 30 minutes of ingestion. Symptoms are similar to chloroquine and treatment must be implemented quickly and should be modeled after experience with chloroquine overdoses. Treatment modalities need further study, but current recommendations are: (1) diazepam for seizures and sedation; (2) early intubation and mechanical ventilation; (3) epinephrine for treatment of vasodilation and myocardial depression; (4) potassium replacement with close monitoring of levels; (5) charcoal for gastrointestinal decontamination if ingestion occurred within an hour; (6) high dose diazepam for life-threatening symptoms, until more information becomes available. No value was found for serum alkalinization or extracorporeal methods of drug removal.", 
    "91": "We demonstrated the effect of clonazepam (2 mg/day) on Meige syndrome in two schizophrenic patients under continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs, and changes in the plasma levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in these cases. The plasma levels of HVA and MHPG during treatment with clonazepam were decreased in the responder, while not changed in the non-responder to clonazepam. A difference between the responder and the non-responder was not found in the plasma GABA levels. These results suggest that hyperactivities of the central dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurones are involved in the pathophysiology of Meige syndrome.", 
    "92": "This study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine for the treatment of delirium in a Korean population. An open trial of olanzapine was conducted in Korean patients with delirium caused by multiple medicosurgical conditions. All subjects were evaluated by Delirium Rating Scale (DRS), which is known to be one of the most sensitive scales for delirium. In addition, other data for profiles of side-effects were collected and analyzed. Twenty patients were treated by olanzapine with doses of 5.9 +/- 1.5 mg/day. The initial dose was 4.6 +/- 0.9 mg/day and maximal dose of olanzapine was 8.8 +/- 2.2 mg/day. The average duration of treatment was 6.6 +/- 1.7 days and the day of maximal response was 3.8 +/- 1.7 treated days. The scores of DRS were significantly improved from 20.0 +/- 3.6 at the time of pretreatment to 9.3 +/- 4.6 at the post-treatment. All subjects showed no definite serious side-effects including anticholinergic and extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine treatment for patients with delirium was effective and safe. This newer drug may be a useful alternative agent to classical antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium.",

Tricuspid regurgitation developed along with right heart insufficiency, and the patient was scheduled for tricuspid replacement. For induction of anesthesia, midazolam and fentanyl were used. After induction, both blood pressure and pulse rate were stable. During extracorporeal circulation, perfusion pressure was controlled at 70-80 mmHg, and the duration of cardio-pulmonary perfusion was about 90 minutes. For withdrawal from extracorporeal circulation, dopamine and dobutamine were used. The course was steady and normal after the withdrawal. In tricuspid valve replacement after heart transplantation, stabilized anesthetic course could be maintained using midazolam and fentanyl.", 
    "94": "Changes in GABA receptor (GABA(A)R) gene expression are detected in animal models of epilepsy, anxiety and in post-mortem schizophrenic brain, suggesting a role for GABA(A)R regulation in neurological disorders. Persistent (48 h) exposure of brain neurons in culture to GABA results in down-regulation of GABA(A)R number and uncoupling of GABA and benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites. Given the central role of GABA(A)Rs in fast inhibitory synaptic transmission, GABA(A)R down-regulation and uncoupling are potentially important mechanisms of regulating neuronal excitability, yet the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this report we show that treatment of brain neurons in culture with tetrodotoxin, glutamate receptor antagonists, or depolarization with 25 mM K(+) fails to alter GABA(A)R number or coupling. Changes in neuronal activity or membrane potential are therefore not sufficient to induce either GABA(A)R down-regulation or uncoupling. Nifedipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) blocker, inhibits both GABA-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and GABA(A)R down-regulation, suggesting that VGCC activation is required for GABA(A)R down-regulation. Depolarization with 25 mM K(+) produces a sustained increase in intracellular [Ca(2+)] without causing GABA(A)R down-regulation, suggesting that activation of VGCCs is not sufficient to produce GABA(A)R down-regulation. In contrast to GABA(A)R down-regulation, nifedipine and 25 mM K(+) fail to inhibit GABA-induced uncoupling, demonstrating that GABA-induced GABA(A)R down-regulation and uncoupling are mediated by independent molecular events. Therefore, GABA(A)R activation initiates at least two distinct signal transduction pathways, one of which involves elevation of intracellular [Ca(2+)] through VGCCs.", 
    "95": "In order to clarify the mechanism by which pGlu-Asn-Cys(Cys)-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH(2) (vasopressin-(4-9)), a major metabolite C-terminal fragment of [Arg(8)]-vasopressin (vasopressin-(1-9)), improves learning and memory, we used several different drugs such as an acetylcholine receptor antagonist, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor, vasopressin receptor antagonists and L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker to disrupt spatial memory in rats. Moreover, we examined the effect of vasopressin-(4-9) on acetylcholine release in the ventral hippocampus using microdialysis. Vasopressin-(4-9) (10 fg/brain, i.c.v.) improved the impairment of spatial memory in the eight-arm radial maze induced by scopolamine, pirenzepine and Ca(2+)/calmodulin -dependent protein kinase II inhibitor. Pirenzepine, a vasopressin V(1A) receptor antagonist, and L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, but not a vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonist, suppressed the effects of vasopressin-(4-9) on scopolamine-induced impairment of spatial memory. Moreover, vasopressin-(4-9) did not affect acetylcholine release in the ventral hippocampus of intact rats or of scopolamine-treated rats as assessed by microdialysis. These results suggest that vasopressin-(4-9) activates vasopressin V(1A) receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of cholinergic neurons, and induces a transient influx of intracellular Ca(2+) through L-type Ca(2+) channels to interact with muscarinic M(1) receptors. The activation of these processes by vasopressin-(4-9) is critically involved in the positive effect of vasopressin-(4-9) on scopolamine-induced impairment of spatial memory.",

Therefore, we treated a 41-year-old woman who had 12 previous hospitalizations for acute mania during a 10-year history of bipolar I disorder with this compound. Since 1991, the patient had been treated with carbamazepine, valproate and lamotrigine with limited success. At the beginning of a new manic episode, topiramate was started in the outpatient clinic. Eight weeks after initiation of treatment, the patient was hospitalized. This inpatient treatment lasted less than 3 weeks. Subsequently, the patient has not been hospitalized again. Topiramate was well tolerated. Even though, during subsequent topiramate treatment, a serious life event (suicide attempt of brother) induced re-occurence of the patient's psychopathology, which did not require hospitalization. Fortunately, inpatient treatment was not necessary due to an increase of topiramate dosage and addition of risperidone and clonazepam. The patient, now on 200 mg/day, is mostly asymptomatic and has functioned well for over 17 months, in contrast to 13 hospitalizations during the previous 10 years.",

The aim of this study is to test the effect of CR2945 on the appearance and distribution of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), proposed as early \"preneoplastic\" lesions in colon carcinogenesis, in the murine model. 176 CD1 male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: group 1, sham group received 2 daily intra-peritoneal injections of saline solution; group 2 received 1 weekly intra-peritoneal injection of DMH 20 mg/kg, for 5 weeks, and 2 daily intra-peritoneal injections of equal volume of NaCl 0.9%; group 3 and 4 received the same weekly dose of DMH and 2 daily injections of CR2945 at the respective doses of 2.5 and 7.5 mg/Kg for 5 weeks. The rodents were sacrified 15, 20, 25, and 38 weeks after receiving the first injection. The number of ACF per area (ACF frequency), their multiplicity (number of crypts per focus), ACF frequency according to each colonic site were recorded. No ACF were found in the sham group. No substantial differences were observed in ACF distribution between the remaining groups. Our hypothesis is that CR2945 does not alter the final number of ACF but might induce a regression of some dysplastic ACF.",

They have been classified as \"non-genotoxic\" carcinogens since they are non-DNA reactive in in vitro assays and are either negative or weakly positive in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay). Male B6C3F1 Big Blue(R) transgenic mice were fed 2500 ppm of OX or PHE or 500 ppm of WY in their diet, while a control group of mice received diet alone for 180 days. The mutant frequency (MF) of cII in the control mice, after correction for clonality, was 6.2 +/- 2.8 x 10(-5). The MF values for mice fed OX, PHE, and WY were 10.0 +/- 3.6 x 10(-5) (P < 0.05), 7.9 +/- 1.3 x 10(-5) (P = 0.1) and 17.4 +/- 4.2 x 10(-5) (P < 0.01), respectively. The mutation spectrum (MS) at cII from the PHE-fed mice was significantly different (P < 0.05) from that of the control mice even though the MF was not, whereas the MS spectra of mice fed OX (P = 0.4) and WY (P = 0.7) were not significantly different. The PHE-derived spectrum differed from the spontaneous spectrum in the lower occurrence of G:C>C:G transversions (17 vs 1.6%) and the higher incidence of A:T>T:A transversions (3.4 vs 9.5%). Prior to correction for clonal expansion, each treated group exhibited a high incidence of frameshift mutations at the homopolymeric run of guanines at bp 179-184 (OX 21%, PHE 21%, WY 16% of the total mutations); this was not the case with the control group (6%). Even after clonal correction, more than 10% of the mutations were frameshifts in the treated mice, while 5% were frameshifts in the control mice. Despite this hypersensitive region of the gene, our findings suggest that the cII locus is less sensitive than the lacI locus to mutation induction by non-DNA reactive carcinogens.",

In rodents, early life exposure to stressful experiences such as social isolation produces a spectrum of symptoms emerging in adult life, which can be restored by antipsychotic drugs. The present series of experiments sought to investigate the effect of clozapine (5-10 mg/kg s.c.), olanzapine (5 mg/kg s.c.), and haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) on dopamine (DA) and amino acids in the prelimbic/infralimbic subregion of the mPFC in group- and isolation-reared rats. Rats reared in isolation showed significant and robust deficits in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle. In group-reared animals, both clozapine and olanzapine produced a significant increase in DA outflow in the mPFC. Isolation-reared rats showed a significant increase in responsiveness to both atypical antipsychotics compared with group-reared animals. In contrast, the administration of haloperidol failed to modify dialysate DA levels in mPFC in either group- or isolation-reared animals. The results also show a positive relationship between the potency of the tested antipsychotics to increase the release of DA in the mPFC and their respective affinities for 5-HT1A relative to DA D2 or D3 receptors. Finally, isolation-reared rats showed enhanced neurochemical responses to the highest dose of clozapine as indexed by alanine, aspartate, GABA, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, and tyrosine. The increased DA responsiveness to the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine may explain, at least in part, clozapine- and olanzapine-induced reversal of some of the major behavioral components of the social isolation syndrome, namely hyperactivity and attention deficit.",

No significant correlations were found between urinary ratio of 6beta-hydroxycortisol to cortisol and any pharmacokinetic parameters of alprazolam (Cmax: rs= -0.06; tmax: r(s)= 0.34; AUC(0-48): rs=0.08; t1/2: r(s)= -0.36).",

    "114": "The aim of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and removal of midazolam and unconjugated and glucuronidated 1-hydroxy-midazolam in 4 intensive care patients on continuous venovenous hemodialysis. Plasma midazolam and its metabolites were assessed by HPLC from blood samples collected during continuous infusion and after the end of infusion. Additional samples from the arterial and venous bloodlines and ultrafiltrate were drawn to calculate sieving coefficient and clearance of ultrafiltration. The elimination half-life of midazolam ranged from 7.6 to 22.8 hours. The clearance of ultrafiltration was between 0.13 and 4.7 ml/min and reached approximately 11% of the total clearance. The range of sieving coefficient was from 0.006 to 0.26, with an average fraction removal of 0.2%. 1-Hydroxy-midazolam glucuronide was removed by continuous hemodialysis (sieving 0.36 to 0.63), with a clearance of ultrafiltration ranging from 7.8 to 12.0 ml/min. These preliminary results showed that midazolam is not removed efficiently, and approximately half of the 1-hydroxy-midazolam glucuronide was removed by dialysis.", 
    "115": "Individual effects of the benzodiazepine tranquilizers phenazepam and gidazepam were studied in neurotic patients and in healthy volunteers tested for the operatory performance under emotiogenic conditions. It was found that manifestations of the tranquiliactivating, tranquilizing, and tranquilisedative effects depend on the individual sensitivity types of the patients and volunteers. The activating manifestations were most pronounced in hypostenic patients, while the sedative action was most significant in hyperstenic persons. The tranquilisedative effect of a single test dose of gidazepam (20 mg) allows predicting a low efficacy of the log-term therapy with benzodiazepines studied. In a group of 40 healthy volunteers, a single 20-mg dose of gidazepam increased the operatory under emotiogenic conditions performance in 19 persons and decreased the results in 12 cases. Volunteers in the first group were characterized as less stress-resistant with respect to a combination of psychological, psychophysiological, and hormonal-biochemical parameters as compared to the second group. It was concluded that the benzodiazepine test is worth of further elaborating as a means of predicting the stress resistance based on the effect of a model benzodiazepine tranquilizer under laboratory conditions.", 
    "116": "The experiments using \"illuminated site\" and \"threatening situation\" avoidance tests on rats microinjected with GABA, glutamic acid, monoamines and their agonists and antagonists, as well as anxiosedative and anxioselective agents into the anterior hypothalamus revealed functional ambiguity in the neurochemical profile of this limbic brain formation in the anxiety states of various aversive genesis. Preliminary intraperitoneal injection of the monoamine and GABA antagonists, followed by the local administration of the antianxiety drugs studied, showed that the antiaversive action of chlordiazepoxide, fenibut, and indoter is manifested in both anxiety models via a GABAergic mechanism in the anterior hypothalamus. The anxiolytic effect of campiron is manifested only under negative-stressor zoosocial conditions and is mediated by the serotoninergic systems of this limbic brain formation.", 
    "117": "Although benzodiazepines are frequently abused by humans, they usually maintain lower rates of self-administration behavior in laboratory animals than other drugs of abuse such as psychomotor stimulants or barbiturates. In the present study, intravenous (i.v.) self-administration of the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam was evaluated in squirrel monkeys. Monkeys (n = 3) initially self-administered the short-acting barbiturate methohexital (100 microg/kg/injection) during daily 1-hour sessions under a fixed-ratio 10, 60 s time-out, schedule of i.v. drug injection. This dose of methohexital maintained high rates of responding averaging 0.9 responses per second. Midazolam was then substituted for methohexital, and midazolam dose was subsequently varied from 0.3 to 3 microg/kg/injection. Each dose of midazolam was tested for five consecutive sessions and each unit dose condition was separated by five sessions of vehicle extinction. The midazolam dose-response function was an inverted U-shaped curve, with maximal rates of self-administration responding averaging 1.01 responses/second at a dose of 1 microg/kg/injection (an average of 48 injections per 1-hour session). The rates and fixed-ratio patterns of responding maintained by self-administration of midazolam in the present study were comparable to the rates and patterns of responding maintained in squirrel monkeys by self-administration of other drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine and tetrahydrocannabinol, under similar experimental conditions.", 
    "118": "The effects on memory of drugs of abuse from several pharmacological classes were examined in four adult male squirrel monkeys responding under a delayed matching-to-sample schedule of food presentation. Subjects were required to emit 20 responses on a sample key transilluminated by either a constant white or a flashing blue light. The twentieth response initiated a 3-second delay followed by presentation of two comparison stimuli. If a response was made to the key that matched the sample stimulus (correct match), a single food pellet (97 mg) was delivered. Pentobarbital (0.32-10 mg/kg), diazepam (0.1-5.6 mg/kg), phencyclidine (0.01-0.32 mg/kg) and cocaine (0.1-3.2 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced accuracy of matching performance towards chance levels. Amphetamine (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) resulted in a small, but statistically significant, reduction in accuracy at a dose of 0.56 mg/kg, while 1.0 mg/kg completely suppressed responding. Analyses indicated that pentobarbital, diazepam and cocaine produced either position or color biases in responding, and in some cases these biases in responding were associated with decreases in accuracy. No such response biases were observed with phencyclidine or D-amphetamine. These results suggest that drug effects on working memory performance can, in some cases, be the result of non-mnemonic processes. Thus, they illustrate the importance of examining behavioral endpoints in addition to task accuracy when interpreting drug effects on working memory in laboratory animals.", 
    "119": "The effects of pre- (30 min before challenge) and post-treatment (5 min after challenge) of L-arginine (840 mg kg(-1)) were tested on picrotoxin-induced increase in ammonia concentrations in brain regions (cerebral cortex, brain stem and cerebellum) and the accompanying convulsive responses in adult male rats. The effect of pre- and post-treatment of L-arginine was tested on the action of diazepam against picrotoxin-induced convulsions. Picrotoxin-induced increase in ammonia concentrations in the brain regions was reverted partially by L-arginine pre-treatment. However, L-arginine pre-treatment failed to inhibit convulsions independently and concurrently with diazepam. On the other hand, L-arginine post-treatment reverted ammonia to control level in all brain regions. A partial but significant inhibition of convulsions was found in these animals. The effect produced concurrently by L-arginine and diazepam post-treatment was much greater than that produced by these agents independently. These results suggest that brain ammonia has a partial but significant participation in the convulsant action of picrotoxin. L-arginine has produced a partial protection of picrotoxin-induced convulsions by reverting brain ammonia to control level. The data further suggest that the duration of action of L-arginine is considerably short and that L-arginine has an additive anticonvulsant action with diazepam.",

Adults with prolonged (lasting five minutes or more) or repetitive generalized convulsive seizures received intravenous diazepam (5 mg), lorazepam (2 mg), or placebo. An identical second injection was given if needed.", 
    "122": "Of the 205 patients enrolled, 66 received lorazepam, 68 received diazepam, and 71 received placebo. Status epilepticus had been terminated on arrival at the emergency department in more patients treated with lorazepam (59.1 percent) or diazepam (42.6 percent) than patients given placebo (21.1 percent) (P=0.001). After adjustment for covariates, the odds ratio for termination of status epilepticus by the time of arrival in the lorazepam group as compared with the placebo group was 4.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 13.0). The odds ratio was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 4.4) in the lorazepam group as compared with the diazepam group and 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.9) in the diazepam group as compared with the placebo group. The rates of respiratory or circulatory complications (indicated by bag valve-mask ventilation or an attempt at intubation, hypotension, or cardiac dysrhythmia) after the study treatment was administered were 10.6 percent for the lorazepam group, 10.3 percent for the diazepam group, and 22.5 percent for the placebo group (P=0.08).",

In this study we compared PBR affinity vs photodynamic efficacy of protoporphyrin-IX (PP-IX) and two structural analogs, PP-III and PP-XIII, using murine leukemia L1210 cells in culture. The results indicate that the three agents have approximately equal hydrophobicity, affinity for L1210 cells and ability to initiate photodamage leading to an apoptotic response. But only PP-IX had significant affinity for the PBR. These data indicate that the relationship between PDT efficacy and PBR affinity may hold only for sensitizers with the PP-IX configuration.",

The results demonstrate the possibility of using this method in medicine and narcology in combination with other instrumental methods.", 
    "126": "K+ secretion in strial marginal cells (SMC) of stria vascularis (SV) is stimulated by beta1-adrenergic receptors. The aim of the present study was to determine, whether SMC from the gerbil inner ear contain muscarinic receptors that inhibit K+ secretion. Receptors were identified with pharmacological tools in functional studies where K+ secretion was monitored as transepithelial current (Isc). The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured as fluo-4 fluorescence and cAMP production with a colorimetric immunoassay. Further, receptors were identified in SV as transcripts by cloning and sequencing of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products. The cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol (CCh) caused a transient increase in [Ca2+]i with a half-maximal concentration value (EC50) of (5 +/- 6) x 10(-6) m (n = 29) and a decrease in basal and stimulated cAMP production. Apical CCh had no effect on Isc but basolateral CCh caused a transient increase in Isc with an EC50 of (3 +/- 1) x 10(-6) m and a sustained decrease of Isc with an EC50 of (1.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(-5) m (n = 129). The effects of CCh on Isc and [Ca2+]i were inhibited in the presence of muscarinic antagonist 10(-6) m atropine. Further, the muscarinic antagonists pirenzipine, methoctramine and para-fluoro-hexahydo-sila-defenidol (pFHHSiD) inhibited the CCh-induced transient increase of Isc with affinity constants (KDB) of 3 x 10(-8) m (pKDB = 7.54 +/- 0.19, n = 17), 2 x 10(-6) m (pKDB = 5.71 +/- 0.26, n = 19) and 2 x 10(-8) m (pKDB = 7.65 +/- 0.28, n = 19) and the sustained decrease of Isc with KDB of 7 x 10(-8) m (pKDB = 7.05 +/- 0.09, n = 33), 6 x 10(-6) m (pKDB = 5.21 +/- 0.13, n = 23), 5 x 10(-8) m (pKDB = 7.34 +/- 0.13, n = 31), respectively. RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from SV using primers specific for the M1-M5 muscarinic receptors revealed products of the predicted sizes for the M3- and M4- but not the M1-, M2- and M5-muscarinic receptor subtypes. Sequence analysis confirmed that amplified cDNA fragments encoded gene-specific nucleotide sequences. These results suggest that K+ secretion in SMC is under the control of M3- and M4-muscarinic receptors that may be located in the basolateral membrane of strial marginal cells.", 
    "127": "Claustrophobia is associated with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) due to the nature of the technique and lengthy examination times. We report the incidence and treatment of claustrophobia in a prospective study on the use of intravenous (IV) and oral diazepam for CMR from August 1997 to June 1999 in 1754 adult patients referred for clinical (1226) and research (528) purposes. Patients under 16 yr of age and adults with learning difficulties were excluded. The initial refusal rate of clinical and research patients was 4.2% (54 clinical and 19 research). Because ethical approval to administer diazepam to research patients had not been granted at the beginning of this study, further analysis of the results excludes the 19 research patients. Of the 54 clinical patients, 31 were given IV diazepam (mean dose, 7.5 mg; range, 2.5-20 mg) with successful scanning in 30 (97%). Eight patients refused sedation, and scanning was not possible. The examination was attempted without sedation by five patients in the claustrophobic group and was terminated early; however, sufficient diagnostic information had been acquired in all cases. A further four patients took oral diazepam up to 1 hr before their appointment, with a 100% success rate. Three patients refused to attend the department due to known severe claustrophobia (2) and concerns over gradient noise (1), and three had medical contraindications to diazepam. Therefore, after the administration of diazepam to alleviate claustrophobia, the failure rate decreased to from 54 (4.4% of clinical patients) to 20 (1.6%) patients, a reduction of 63%. When it is possible to give diazepam to patients with claustrophobia at the time of CMR, it is a safe, predictable, and highly effective method of obtaining a successful result. A protocolfor the use of diazepam has been developed and is now also approved by our institutional ethics committee for use in research patients.",

The study of phenazepam effect upon the rat EEG showed that a PC sound card with the corresponding sound processing files can reveal the tranquilizer effects in EEG with the aid of standard analog-to-digital converters and bioelectric data processing routines. The obtained results show expediency of using the PC sound cards for the cerebral activity testing data processing.", 
    "129": "Open-field tests revealed a significant decrease in the degree of H3-diazepam binding in the brain of BALB/c mice and MR rats. No such effects were observed in the C57BL/6 and MNRA strains. No interstrain distinctions were observed in the intact animals.", 
    "130": "The results of pharmacogenetic experiments revealed specificity of the emotional-stress reactions (ESR) in the inherited deterministic type of behavior and showed dependence of the benzodiazepine tranquilizer action on the ESR phenotype. Based on these data, we carried out experiments with a group of volunteers performing operator functions in a model of emotional-stress conditions. The results of these experiments allowed the operators to be divided into stress-resistant and stress-affected groups. The results of the data processing by methods of multidimensional statistics showed possibility of predicting the ESR phenotype and the qualitative effect of phenazepam (0.5 mg. p.o.) based on the individual topological and hormonal-biochemical characteristics of operators.", 
    "131": "We have demonstrated that ethanol-induced motor incoordination is modulated by cerebellar adenosine A(1) receptor. This study represents an extension into another important brain motor area, the striatum that, unlike cerebellum, has high density of both A(1) and A(2A) receptors. Direct intra-striatal micro-infusion of Ro15-4513 (0.05, 0.5, 1 ng), a partial inverse-agonist of benzodiazepine, significantly and nearly dose-dependently attenuated ethanol-induced motor incoordination indicating mediation of ethanol's motor incoordination by striatum. Intra-striatal A(1)-selective agonist N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA; 1, 2, 4 ng), A(1) = A(2A) non-selective agonist, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA; 1.5, 3, 6 ng), and A(1)-selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX; 25, 50, 100 ng) dose-dependently accentuated and attenuated, respectively, ethanol-induced motor incoordination, strongly suggesting modulation by striatal adenosine A(1) receptor. Intra-striatal DPCPX significantly antagonized not only ethanol-induced motor incoordination but also its potentiation by intra-striatal CHA, R-(+)-N(6)-(2-phenylisopropyladenosine) (R-PIA), or NECA. No change in motor coordination occurred after the highest dose of CHA, R-PIA, or NECA followed by saline. Similarly, the highest intra-striatal dose of Ro15-4513 or DPCPX neither altered motor coordination or locomotor activity indicating relative selectivity of interaction with ethanol. Nearly 25-fold higher dose of A(2A)-selective agonist, CGS-21680, compared to CHA was necessary to produce a comparable potentiation of ethanol's motor incoordination perhaps suggesting a lack of or less significant striatal A(2A) involvement. Intra-striatal pertussis toxin (0.5 microg) pre-treatment markedly attenuated ethanol-induced motor incoordination as well as its potentiation by intra-striatal CHA. These results support that striatum is one of the brain motor areas mediating the motor impairing effects of acute ethanol and that the latter's modulation occurs via A(1)-selective receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins.", 
    "132": "We investigated the role of kainate (KA) receptor activation and desensitization in inducing the increase in the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in individual cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The rat hippocampal neurons in the cultures were shown to express kainate receptor subunits, KA2 and GluR6/7, either by immunocytochemistry or by immunoblot analysis. The effect of LY303070, an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist, on the alterations in the [Ca(2+)](i) caused by kainate showed cell-to-cell variability. The [Ca(2+)](i) increase caused by kainate was mostly mediated by the activation of AMPA receptors because LY303070 inhibited the response to kainate in a high percentage of neurons. The response to kainate was potentiated by concanavalin A (Con A), which inhibits kainate receptor desensitization, in 82.1% of the neurons, and this potentiation was not reversed by LY303070 in about 38% of the neurons. Also, upon stimulation of the cells with 4-methylglutamate (MGA), a selective kainate receptor agonist, in the presence of Con A, it was possible to observe [Ca(2+)](i) changes induced by kainate receptor activation, because LY303070 did not inhibit the response in all neurons analyzed. In toxicity studies, cultured rat hippocampal neurons were exposed to the drugs for 30 min, and the cell viability was evaluated at 24 hr using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The selective activation of kainate receptors with MGA, in the presence of Con A, induced a toxic effect, which was not prevented by LY303070, revealing a contribution of a small subpopulation of neurons expressing kainate receptors that independently mediate cytotoxicity. Taken together, these results indicate that cultured hippocampal neurons express not only AMPA receptors, but also kainate receptors, which can modulate the [Ca(2+)](i) and toxicity.",

    "136": "The aetiology of the peritumoural brain dysfunction that is rectified by steroids is unknown. To determine potential aspects of its pathophysiological basis we performed metabolic, histochemical and neuroreceptor studies in rodents with striatal C6 glioma. This model is known to cause focal neurobehavioural and electrophysiological dysfunction. The fully quantitative [(14)C]-2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique of measuring local cerebral metabolism of glucose (LCMRglu) showed raised LCMRglu (22-29%) in the pallidum, substantia nigra and endopeduncular nucleus. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry and a range of ligand binding studies for dopamine type 1 and 2, and serotonergic 5-HT(2)receptors were negative in the tumour and normal in peritumoural brain. 5-HT uptake sites and strong peripheral benzodiazepine receptor expression were present in the tumour. There was extensive up-regulation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor expression in the peritumoural brain. These studies show there is metabolic dysregulation in brain regions functionally connected to, but anatomically distant from the striatum. There is also a peritumoural region of up-regulated receptors that have many, predominantly inhibitory, functions. The relationship of these findings to peritumoural brain dysfunction is discussed."
