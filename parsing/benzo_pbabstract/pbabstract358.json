Both CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1-PCs) and dentate gyrus granule cells (DG-GCs) were studied in rat hippocampal slices with extracellular recordings. Midazolam depressed the amplitudes of orthodromic population spikes (O-PS) and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slopes of CA1-PCs in a dose-dependent manner, but depressed those of DG-GCs to a lesser extent. On the other hand, midazolam had little effect on the amplitudes of antidromic population spikes of both CA1-PCs and DG-GCs. A GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline strongly antagonized the depressant effects of 75 microM midazolam on the amplitudes of O-PS by 73% in CA1-PCs, whereas it did not antagonize the effects of midazolam in DG-GCs. These results suggest that the differential effects of midazolam could be due to the different types and/or density of GABAA receptors between CA1-PCs and DG-GCs.", 
    "1": "Epidemiological and analytical laboratory records concerning living drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drug (DUID) during the 13 years period ranging from 1982 to 1994 were examined. This study included 641 records. 551 men (86%) and 90 women (14%). The average age of the drivers was 27 +/- 7 years (n = 636, minimum 18 and maximum 74) and the 18-30 interval age range was overrepresented (80%) in this population sample. A traffic accident had occurred in 254 (40%) of the records, 273 (43%) drivers were suspected of DUID during police controls and 95 (15%) drivers were suspected of DUID because of their erratic driving. One or more psychoactive drugs were found in 92.8% of the samples. In these records, cannabinoids were found in 57%, opiates in 36%, ethanol in 36%, benzodiazepines in 15%, cocaine in 11%, methadone in 10% and amphetamines in 4%. The majority (58%) of cases presented two or more drugs in biological samples, thus indicating a high incidence of potential interactions between drugs. This observation was specially relevant for methadone and methaqualone. We conclude that police suspicion about drivers under influence highly correlated with positive results for drug analyses in biological samples.", 
    "2": "The effects of Ro 15-4513 in preventing cocaine and combined cocaine-ethanol toxicities were examined in mice. Ro 15-4513 is a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, which has been implicated in ethanol lethality and cocaine-induced seizures. Ro 15-4513 (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 15 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 10 min before the administration of saline and cocaine (75 mg/kg) in the cocaine groups, or before ethanol (3 g/kg) and cocaine (75 mg/kg) in the cocaine-ethanol groups. In both cocaine and cocaine-ethanol groups, two distinct groups of dead animals meeting the same criteria, the IL (immediate lethal) and DL (delayed lethal) groups, could be differentiated, depending on their survival times, observed disorders, and drug levels at the time of death. Differences in the seizure scores further subdivided the two groups. Ro 15-4513 protected mainly against the immediate lethality in the cocaine groups and mainly against the delayed lethality in the cocaine-ethanol groups. The dose of Ro 15-4513 providing the maximal protection against the lethal effects of these drugs was 10 mg/kg in the cocaine groups, and 5 mg/kg in the cocaine-ethanol groups. The sum of the lethalities was still higher with the maximal effective dose of Ro 15-4513 in the cocaine-ethanol groups than in the cocaine groups. In the cocaine-ethanol groups, 5 mg/kg of Ro 15-4513 attenuated both brain and liver cocaethylene levels. Cocaine-induced seizures were also attenuated by any dose of Ro 15-4513 used in the cocaine groups. Although some discrepancies were observed in the protective properties, some validity for the use of Ro 15-4513, a drug with more than one mode of protective action, was demonstrated in this study.", 
    "3": "The benzodiazepinedione class of non-peptidal GPIIbIIIa antagonists has been modified to allow the isolation of noninterconverting rotational isomers, or atropisomers, with the aim of examining their structure-activity relationships as compared to active RGD-containing peptides and other non-peptidal antagonists. Resolution of these antagonists was accomplished by the introduction of a tert-butyl group at N1 and a chlorine at C9 on the 3,4-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione nucleus and enantiospecific substitution on the beta-alanine side chain attached to N4. The relative configuration was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Further, conformational analyses using ab initio calculations were performed to assess the conformational preferences about the beta-alanine side chain. The data support a good topographical correlation between the benzodiazepinedione class of antagonists and the \"cupped\" presentation of the RGD tripeptide sequence found in the cyclic peptide G4120. The relationship between these compounds with other peptidal and non-peptidal antagonists is discussed.", 
    "4": "A common feature of general anaesthetic agents is their ability to potentiate neuronal inhibition through GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. At concentrations relevant to clinical anaesthesia, these agents cause a dramatic stimulation of the chloride currents that are evoked by the binding of the natural ligand, GABA. Although there is widespread evidence that the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to anaesthetic agents is heterogeneous, the structural basis of these differences is largely unknown. Variations in subunit composition can have profound effects on the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to modulatory agents such as benzodiazepines. However, strict subunit specificity has not been demonstrated for the potentiating effects of anaesthetic agents. Here we describe a new class of human GABA(A) receptor subunit (epsilon) that can assemble with alpha- and beta-subunits and confer an insensitivity to the potentiating effects of intravenous anaesthetic agents. The epsilon-subunit also abolishes the normal outward rectification of recombinant receptors in which it assembles. The expression pattern of this subunit in the brain suggests a new target for manipulation of neuronal pathways within the basal ganglia.",

The method was based on immobilisation of 1.5 microliters of 1-octanol on a polyacrylate-coated fiber designed for solid-phase microextraction. The solvent-modified fibre was used to extract diazepam from the samples. The plasma sample was pre-treated to release diazepam from the protein binding. The fibre was inserted into the modified plasma sample, adjusted to pH 5.5 an internal standard was added and the mixture was carefully stirred for 4 min. The fibre with the immobilised solvent and the enriched analytes was injected into the capillary gas chromatograph. The solvent and the extracted analytes were evaporated at 300 degrees C in the split-splitless injection port of the gas chromatograph, separated on a methylsilicon capillary column and detected with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector. The method was shown to be reproducible with a detection limit of 0.10 nmol/ml in human plasma.", 
    "10": "In the present paper we tried to test the hypothesis that nonspecific flunitrazepam-membrane interactions are consistent with drug molecules accommodated between lipid molecules, becoming an integral part of the bilayer. We developed a spectrophotometric method to determine FNTZH+ equilibrium dissociation constant and applied it to the study of the acid-base equilibria of this drug in homogeneous media of different polarity. In these conditions, pK decreased with the decrement in the dielectric constant (D) of the media. These results, analyzed under the light of the theory developed by Fernandez and Fromherz (1977; J. Phys. Chem. 81, 1755-1761) let us infer that flunitrazepam is localized a region with D = 60. This D value is lower that Dwater = 78 and higher than D of hydrocarbon chains zone (D = 2-5) and would correspond to D of the region of polar groups. This result is compatible with the hypothesis.", 
    "11": "The influence of decreased endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration on benzodiazepine receptor function was studied in the brain of living baboons. Positron emission tomography and the radiotracer [11C]flumazenil combined with electroencephalography were used to determine the pharmacological properties of two bezodiazepine receptors agonists, diazepam and bretazenil, in baboons pre-treated or not with DL-allylglycine (an inhibitor of GABA synthesis). Our results show that, in vivo, DL-allylglycine reduces the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors for their agonists without altering the intrinsic capability of agonists to allosterically modulate GABAergic transmission.",

NBQX protected cultured neurons against AMPA (20 \u03bcM for 21-23 h) induced toxicity with EC(50) of 0.5 \u03bcM. In the same test GYKI 52466, 53405 and 53655 had EC(50) values of 10.6, 9.3 and 5.1 \u03bcM, respectively. Thus we found the competitive antagonist NBQX to be ten times more effective neuroprotectant in vitro than the most potent non-competitive GYKI compound (GYKI 53655).", 
    "13": "A single 5 min exposure to the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety renders animals insensitive to the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepines in this test. The purpose of the present experiments was to explore whether this phenomenon resulted from a change in the functional state of benzodiazepine receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (0.5, 1, and 2 microg) and antagonist flumazenil (100 and 500 ng) were directly administered to the dorsal raphe nucleus in rats either naive to, or with one previous 5 min exposure of, the elevated plus-maze. In naive rats, midazolam produced significant anxiolytic effects at all doses, and flumazenil was silent. In plus-maze-experienced rats, midazolam no longer had anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze, but flumazenil did, indicating that the previous experience of the maze had changed the state of the benzodiazepine receptor. This changed receptor function generalized to the social interaction test. Thus, in naive animals tested in high light, midazolam (0.5, 1, and 2 microg) had significant anxiolytic effects and flumazenil (100 and 500 ng) was silent, whereas in plus-maze-experienced rats both midazolam (1 microg) and flumazenil (500 ng) had significant anxiolytic effects. Extensive analysis of locomotor activity in both tests showed that the changed responsivity to midazolam could not be explained by habituation, because on none of the measures used was there any difference in motor activity scores between plus-maze-naive and experienced rats.", 
    "14": "Cerebellar granule cells express six GABAA receptor subunits abundantly (alpha1, alpha6, beta2, beta3, gamma2, and delta) and assemble various pentameric receptor subtypes with unknown subunit compositions; however, the rules guiding receptor subunit assembly are unclear. Here, removal of intact alpha6 protein from cerebellar granule cells allowed perturbations in other subunit levels to be studied. Exon 8 of the mouse alpha6 subunit gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. In alpha6 -/- granule cells, the delta subunit was selectively degraded as seen by immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblot analysis with delta subunit-specific antibodies. The delta subunit mRNA was present at wild-type levels in the mutant granule cells, indicating a post-translational loss of the delta subunit. These results provide genetic evidence for a specific association between the alpha6 and delta subunits. Because in alpha6 -/- neurons the remaining alpha1, beta2/3, and gamma2 subunits cannot rescue the delta subunit, certain potential subunit combinations may not be found in wild-type cells.", 
    "15": "Methadone, a synthetic drug, is one of the most widely used drugs for opiate dependency treatment. This drug has been demonstrated to be extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 in human liver microsomes. Thus, the aim of this in vitro study was to determine if methadone is an inhibitor of other P450s characterized by their specific catalytic activities. Enzymatic activities specific to P450 2E1, P450 1A, P450 2B and P450 2C were not inhibited by methadone. Conversely, nifedipine oxidation, mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4, was potently inhibited by methadone by a mixed-type inhibition mechanism with a Ki of 100 microM. Fluvoxamine, a new antidepressant, was shown to be a potent mixed-type inhibitor of methadone N-demethylation with a Ki of 7 microM. Finally, methadone appears to be a mixed-type inhibitor and not a suicide inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A family. Accordingly, caution should be advised in the clinical use of methadone when other drugs are administered that are able to induce or inhibit P450 3A4, such as rifampicin or nifedipine, diazepam and fluvoxamine.", 
    "16": "Based on the existence of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine in human placenta, we have investigated the presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in brush-border and basal plasma membranes from human term placenta. Radioligand binding assay, using [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine as tracer, showed the existence of acetylcholine muscarinic receptors in brush-border (Kd 0.28 +/- 0.04 nM; Bmax 9.4 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg protein) and basal plasma membranes (Kd 0.24 +/- 0.05 nM; Bmax 34.3 +/- 6.3 fmol/mg protein). In order to perform a pharmacological characterization of these receptors, competition binding experiments were carried out using the muscarinic receptor antagonists pirenzepine, (11(2-diethyl-amino)methyl)-1-piperidinylacetyl-5-11-dihydro-6H-py rido(14) benzodiazepine (AF-DX 116), himbacine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), dicyclomine and hexahydro-sila-difenidol (HHSD). The results obtained showed that the muscarinic receptors in brush-border and basal plasma membranes belong to different subtypes. In brush-border membranes, the receptor found match in terms of affinity for the antagonists with the muscarinic M1 receptor subtype (Ki pirenzepine, 13.6 +/- 8.2 nM; Ki AF-DX 116, 1680 +/- 271 nM; Ki himbacine, 212 +/- 6.5 nM; Ki 4-DAMP. 1.5 +/- 0.4 nM; Ki dicyclomine, 5.1 +/- 0.8 nM; Ki HHSD, 34.3 +/- 7.3 nM), whereas the receptor in basal plasma membrane seems to be of the muscarinic M2 receptor subtype (Ki pirenzepine, 202 +/- 48 nM; Ki AF-DX 116, 124 +/- 60 nM; Ki himbacine, 20.6 +/- 4.8 nM; Ki 4-DAMP, 4.5 +/- 1.2 nM; Ki dicyclomine, 54.6 +/- 22 nM; Ki HHSD, 89.2 +/- 15.8 nM). The results obtained show the existence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in brush-border and basal plasma membranes from human term placenta with a different distribution pattern in terms of number of receptors and distribution of different subtypes. The functional significance of these findings is as yet unknown, but these receptors probably mediate different functions as they belong to different subtypes and are coupled to different second messengers.", 
    "17": "Using dissociated spiral ganglion cell cultures obtained from 3-day-old rat cochlea, we investigated the response of auditory neurones to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using patch-clamp techniques. In our recording conditions, GABA elicited inward currents in > 95% of the neurones which reversed around 0 mV. Similar inward currents were measured using isoguvacin, a specific agonist of GABAA receptors. GABA-gated currents were reversibly inhibited by the channel blocker picrotoxin and the GABA competitive antagonist bicuculline. These functional GABAA receptors are characterized by an insensitivity to benzodiazepines and a relatively high sensitivity to beta-carbolines and barbiturates. These results show that the GABAA receptor pharmacological properties of spiral ganglion neurones are close to those of cerebellar granule cells.",

    "24": "Clinical studies indicate that patients with acute schizophrenia may benefit from benzodiazepine treatment. Therefore we investigated the benzodiazepine receptor distribution and diazepam binding in 20 patients with DSM-III schizophrenia using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with iomazenil as the ligand. In each patient, two SPECT images were obtained: SPECT 1 was obtained 2 h after intravenous injection of 200 MBq I-123-iomazenil. Following SPECT 1, patients received 10 mg diazepam intravenously. Twenty min later, SPECT 2 was started. The highest iomazenil uptake was found in the occipital cortex followed by the frontal and temporal cortices. Baseline iomazenil uptake in the medial frontal cortex was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with the BPRS total score (r = 0.46). Diazepam injection led to a significant activity decrease in iomazenil binding which was greatest in the frontal regions of interest. With respect to the medial frontal cortex, this effect was significantly (P < 0.05) more pronounced in patients with a remitting than a chronic course of the disorder. These findings suggest that changes of the benzodiazepine receptor system in the frontal cortex may be associated with severity and chronicity of schizophrenia.",

The analytes were desorbed with 2 ml of ethyl acetate and a 110-microliter aliquot of the eluate was injected into the gas chromatograph via the loop-type interface using fully concurrent solvent evaporation conditions. Detection of the benzodiazepines was carried out with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (NPD). The ASPEC-GC-NPD was fully automated and could run unattended overnight. With a sample volume of 1 ml the procedure showed good linearity and repeatability in the range 5-50 ng/ml using a sample volume of 1 ml. The limits of detection in plasma were 0.5-2 ng/ml.",

Drug administration occurred prior to an afternoon work session (13.00 h), and at the onset of an evening recreation period (17.30 h). On 'sample' days, participants were administered placebo or alprazolam (0.75 mg), and at the end of the afternoon work session, were told whether their task performance was 'better' or 'worse' than average. If they received 'better' feedback they earned $55, and if they received 'worse' feedback, they earned $15. On 'choice' days, participants chose to self-administer either alprazolam or placebo, with feedback occurring on two of the four choice days. Feedback was not actually linked to performance, but instead was pre-programmed. For one week, alprazolam administration was always associated with 'better' feedback on sample and choice days, and in the other week was associated with 'worse' feedback. When no feedback was delivered, alprazolam was self-administered equally often in the afternoon (57%) and evening (71%). When feedback was delivered, it significantly influenced the choice to self-administer alprazolam in the afternoon. 'Better than average' feedback resulted in alprazolam self-administration 57% of the time, but alprazolam self-administration decreased to 14% when it was associated with 'worse than average' feedback and reduced earnings.

With the exception of the second-order repeated acquisition of response sequences task, dose-related changes in performance were observed during all tasks, but effects were significant only following the 1 mg dose. No drug-related changes were observed on visual-analog scale ratings of drug effect.

Inhalational sedation is commonly carried out with nitrous oxide and oxygen while isoflurane in oxygen has also been tried out. Intravenous sedation is commonly carried out with midazolam or diazepam given as a single titrated dose to an end point which does not result in anaesthesia. When sedation with benzodiazepines is carried out, the specific antagonist, flumazenil should always be available for use in emergencies such as accidental oversedation, iatrogenic overdose or paradoxical reactions. Patient controlled sedation with midazolam, the modern technique of intravenous sedation, is comparable to anaesthetist controlled sedation and patients may be administered increments of one milligram at one minute intervals. Computer controlled sedation has been carried out with propofol.

Non-hypnotic doses of the barbiturates phenobarbital (5-50 mg/kg), pentobarbital (17-33 mg/kg), and thiopental (7.5-30 mg/kg), of the benzodiazepine midazolam (10 mg/kg) or of ethanol (0.4-1.6 g/kg) administered by the systemic route reduced the latency for the tail-flick response, thus inducing a 'hyperalgesic' state in the animals. In contrast, non-convulsant doses of the GABA-A antagonist picrotoxin (0.12-1.0 mg/kg) administered systemically induced an increase in the latency for the tail-flick response, therefore characterizing an 'antinociceptive' state. Previous picrotoxin (0.12 mg/kg) treatment abolished the hyperalgesic state induced by effective doses of the barbiturates, midazolam or ethanol. Since phenobarbital, midazolam and ethanol reproduced the described hyperalgesic effect of GABA-A-specific agonists (muscimol, THIP), which is specifically antagonized by the GABA-A antagonist picrotoxin, our results suggest that GABA-A receptors are tonically involved in the modulation of nociception in the rat central nervous system.", 
    "44": "The acute behavioral effects of buspirone (15 and 30 mg/70 kg), alprazolam (0.75 and 1.5 mg/70 kg), and placebo, alone and in combination with ethanol (0-0.6 g/kg), were tested in 13 volunteers. Ethanol alone produced only a few significant behavioral effects. Alprazolam and buspirone produced comparable dose-related increases in participant ratings of sedation, but only alprazolam impaired performance. The buspirone-ethanol and alprazolam-ethanol combinations produced robust sedative-like participant-related drug effects that were similar in magnitude, but, in general, only the alprazolam-ethanol combinations impaired performance. These findings suggest that the participant-rated effects of therapeutic doses of buspirone in combination with moderate doses of ethanol are similar to those of therapeutic doses of alprazolam in combination with ethanol, but the performance-impairing effects of buspirone are distinguishable from those of alprazolam, alone and in combination with ethanol.", 
    "45": "Because benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide increase food intake, the present experiments tested the effect of chlordiazepoxide on food intake in an animal model of anorexia nervosa, called activity anorexia (AA). To induce AA, rats (Rattus norvegicus) were maintained in activity wheels and restricted to a single 60-min feeding period each day. As previously found, this procedure suppressed food intake. After several days of this training, food intake was measured 30 min after the rats were injected with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) or saline. In 2 experiments, chlordiazepoxide counteracted the suppression of food intake produced by AA. Because benzodiazepines have been found to increase food intake in many mammalian species including primates, the present results suggest that benzodiazepines could be useful in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.", 
    "46": "The linkage-testing strain of ABP/Le mice carries six mutations which express in easily identifiable phenotypes. By crossing this strain with a traditional inbred strain (C57BL/6ByJ) which is the 'wild type' for the mutated ABP/Le loci, we produced Mendelian populations, intercrosses and backcrosses so as to estimate whether the sensitivity to methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, and anxiety-related behaviour could be related to a common genetically determined substrate. We have shown that one locus on chromosome 9 is associated with beta-CCM-induced seizures and three loci on chromosomes 4, 7 and 9 are associated with anxiogenic processes. Analysis of [3H]flumazenil binding suggested a possible involvement of a Bmax decrease in both beta-CCM-induced seizures and anxiogenic processes. The putative common genetic regulation of both mechanisms is discussed.", 
    "47": "Calmidazolium potently stimulated steroidogenesis in a mouse adrenocortical Y1 cell line, in a Ca(2+)-independent manner, an effect similar to that reported by Choi and Cooke [1] for rat primary adrenocortical and Leydig cells. Calmidazolium analogues, econazole and miconazole, were shown to inhibit both this calmidazolium-stimulated rate and the endogenous rate of steroidogenesis. In determining the mechanism by which imidazole compounds affect steroidogenesis, they were found not to act directly on the mitochondrial Cyt P-450scc enzyme, making it likely that they act instead on the intramitochondrial transport of cholesterol. Using competition binding studies, calmidazolium, econazole and miconazole were subsequently identified as novel ligands for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Econazole and miconazole were found to inhibit stimulation by PK 11195 (a specific PBR ligand) of steroidogenesis, whereas treatment of the cells with calmidazolium and PK 11195 at the same time resulted in an additive stimulatory effect on steroidogenesis. These results suggest that the effects of these substituted imidazoles on steroidogenesis in Y1 cells is not mediated through their interaction with the PBR.", 
    "48": "The isoquinoline PK11195 has been suggested as a marker of glial pathology in the lesioned brain. The aim of the present study is to clarify the precise cellular location of its binding site in the central nervous system. Here, we report that in the facial nucleus after facial nerve axotomy-a lesion causing a retrograde neuronal reaction without nerve cell death while keeping the blood-brain barrier intact--activated microglia are the predominant source of lesion-induced increases of PK11195 binding. Likewise, increased PK11195 binding is seen in the gracile nucleus after anterograde neuronal injury following sciatic nerve transection. The peak of PK11195 binding, using the single isomer R-PK11195, was observed 4 days after the peripheral nerve lesion, consistent with the well-known time course of microglial activation. Photoemulsion microautoradiography confirmed the restriction of PK11195 binding to activated microglia. The increase of PK11195 binding in the facial nucleus seen after selective cell death of facial motoneurons by retrograde suicide transport of toxic ricin, a lesion that is accompanied by the rapid transformation of microglia into phagocytes, was no higher than that seen following axotomy. This suggests that the full transformation of microglia into parenchymal phagocytes is not necessary to reach maximal levels of PK11195 binding. PK11195, therefore, is a well-suited marker to detect microglial activation in areas of subtle brain pathology, where neither a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier function nor the presence of macrophages and inflammatory cells indicate an on-going disease process.", 
    "49": "Ifosfamide is one of the most efficient antimitotic in soft tissue sarcoma. To try to find a possible dose-effect, 10 patients with advanced pretraited relapsed soft tissue sarcoma received 15 g/m2/cycle ifosfamide in continuous infusion during 5 days. A pharmacokinetic study was done for 2 patients. All patients received growth factors, ondansetron and 8 clonazepam. Renal toxicity was evaluated after the first and the second cycle. Twenty two cycles were delivered to patients who have been already treated with ifosfamid (10 patients with 15 g/m2 to 54 g/m2, median 27 g/m2) or cis platinum (2 patients). No major renal or neurologic toxicity was observed; only subclinical modifications of urinary enzymes excretion were found. Two patients had visual hallucinations at the end of a cycle and just in the 2 following days; another presented a neuropathy of inferior limbs. Hematological toxicity was very limited. Pharmacokinetic study did not show induction mechanism at this dosage and with this type of administration. So ifosfamide 3 g/m2 during 5 days is feasible. The few level of complications observed is perhaps linked to the daily dose of 3 g/m2 instead of 4 g/m2 or more used in the other studies.", 
    "50": "The antinociceptive effect of SM 32 was examined in mice by using the hot-plate (10-40 mg kg(-1) i.p; 3-30 microg per mouse i.c.v.) and abdominal constriction (10-30 mg kg(-1) i.p) tests. In the antinociceptive dose-range, SM 32 did not impair mouse spontaneous motility and motor coordination evaluated respectively by the Animex and rota-rod tests. The increase in the pain threshold produced by SM 32 was prevented by dicyclomine, pirenzepine and hemicholinium-3 but not by naloxone and CGP 35348. In vitro experiments showed that the SM 32 amplified electrically- and nicotine-evoked guinea-pig ileum contractions. On the basis of the above data, it can be postulated that SM 32 exerts its antinociceptive effect through a potentiation of central cholinergic transmission.", 
    "51": "The use of PRN or 'as required' medication by mental health nurses is an important, yet little explored aspect of psychiatric inpatient care. In a survey of 100 inpatients in Canada (Craven et al. 1987), it was reported that 88% had been prescribed PRN medication. The most frequently administered drugs were antipsychotics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines. Similar results were found in a study by Walker (1991). Craven et al. (1987) also highlight that people over the age of 50 are more likely to be given PRN medication, and suggest that gender and legal status do not influence administration. Vitello et al. (1991), in a study of factors affecting the administration of PRN medication on a children's psychiatric unit, demonstrated that 91% of administrations were given orally (compared to 9% via intramuscular injection); however it is unclear if this finding can be generalized to an adult psychiatric setting. Mental health nurses' reasons for administering PRN medication have not been examined.", 
    "52": "In five homes for the aged in the city of Bremen that were also nursing homes, we studied the drug supply and drug intake of 301 inmates with particular reference to psychotropics, basing on the available records. The average regular drug intake covered 3.99 drugs. Furthermore, prescriptions for an average of 1.16 additionally required drugs were issued. More than one-quarter of the inmates (27.2%) took between 6 to 11 different drugs permanently. More than one half of the inmates (50.8%) were given prescriptions for psychotropics; 45.2% took at least one psychotropic permanently. Prescription of benzodiazepines of medium or long half-time was strikingly frequent; these are in fact drugs that are usually unsuitable for administration to elderly persons. As far as antidepressants/tranquilisers are concerned, we noticed that tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed almost exclusively.", 
    "53": "To study the effect of general anesthesia with diazepam, fentanyl and nitric oxide, a common combination during the intraoperative recording of visual evoked potentials (VEP) in transsphenoidal surgery, we compared the amplitude and latency of VEP components before anesthesia and at four moments after induction during the first hour of elective breast surgery in 20 patients with no neurological deficits. The results for these patients (group I) before anesthesia and 15 min after induction were also compared to presurgical recordings for 19 patients with hypophysial tumors and histories visual field and acuity involvement (group II). Latency increased significantly as a result of anesthesia whereas amplitude was affected to a lesser degree. Changes in latency of the main positive component was after anesthesia was the only parameter that was significantly different for the two group studied, variation being greater in group II.", 
    "54": "We evaluated whether Gi has a tonic inhibitory influence on myocardial adenylate cyclase (AC) in an agonist-independent way, and, if so, whether this is attributable to substantial coupling between agonist-free, empty inhibitory receptors and G. Rabbits received pertussis toxin (PTX, 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) 40 h before preparing ventricular myocardial membranes, which was associated with virtually complete in vivo ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of the 41-kDa substrate. Pretreatment with PTX had no influence on basal AC activity but significantly enhanced AC activity elicited by 100 microM GTP. Furthermore, it markedly increased AC activity stimulated with 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) and isoproterenol through a wide range of concentrations of these stimulants. These findings indicate that Gi has a tonic influence on he stimulatory effects of guanine nucleotides and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation on AC even in the absence of the inhibitory receptor agonists. The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine and AF-DX 116 significantly enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity, as PTX pretreatment did, except that statistically significant increasing effects of these antagonists on GppNHp-stimulated AC activity was observed only at higher concentrations of GppNHp. The enhancement by atropine was not detected in PTX-pretreated membranes. The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 did not modify the stimulatory effects of guanine nucleotides and isoproterenol on AC in either control or PTX-pretreated membranes, excluding the possible involvement of beta 2-adrenoceptors in tonic activation of Gi. We conclude that Gi is tonically activated by agonist-free, empty muscarinic receptors, which leads to attenuation of Gs-mediated or beta-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of AC. The potentiating effect of PTX pretreatment on GppNHp-stimulated AC activity may be at least partially due to the direct action of PTX on the Gi heterotrimeric complex, independently of the coupled receptors.", 
    "55": "The anti-conflict and amnesic effects of three benzodiazepines (diazepam, alprazolam and triazolam) po-administered in mice were assessed by a modified Geller Seifter conflict test and a non-matching to sample test using a 4-arm maze with 3 selectable arms, respectively. Diazepam (10 mg/kg), alprazolam (1-10 mg/kg) and triazolam (1 and 3 mg/kg) significantly increased the lever-press in the alarm period (punished responding) under the conflict test. Under the non-matching to sample test, the correct response (CR), but not non-reward response (NR), decreased depending on the delay time. Diazepam (3 mg/kg) significantly decreased the CR under 0-sec delay condition, but not that under 30-sec delay condition. Comparatively higher doses of the benzodiazepines, diazepam (10 mg/kg), alprazolam (1 and 3 mg/kg) and triazolam (0.3 and 1 mg/kg), significantly decreased the CR under both 0- and 30-sec delay conditions. However, no significant change in the NR was produced by any dose of the three benzodiazepines. These results suggest that the decrease in CR during the non-matching to sample test is caused by the impairment of cognitive function rather than working and reference memories, and that such effects appear at doses equal to and/or less than the effective doses for anti-conflict effect. However, the assumption that triazolam has the highest risk of induction of amnesia, as compared to the advantage of sleep induction or relief of anxiety in the benzodiazepine group, was not supported by the present results.", 
    "56": "Secretion of pancreatic digestive enzymes was measured in pancreatic cannulated rats after duodenal stimulation with Kunitz or Bowman-Birk protease inhibitors or their complexes with trypsin and/or chymotrypsin. Free and complexed inhibitors were bound by the duodenal epithelium, stimulated the discharge of cholecystokinin, and significantly increased secretion rates of alpha-amylase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen. Inasmuch as secretion rates returned to basal levels with cholecystokinin-A receptor antagonists, the stimulation was likely to be mediated by cholecystokinin. Soya factors also influenced the duodenal concentration of pancreatic enzymes under simulated feeding conditions. Thus the level of alpha-amylase increased while the trypsin concentration decreased in rats gavaged with free or complexed inhibitors. The same was true for chymotrypsin when the Bowman-Birk inhibitor was used, but the Kunitz inhibitor and its trypsin complex actually raised the luminal concentration of chymotrypsin. Accordingly, because soya inhibitors remained effective in stimulating pancreatic secretion after elimination of their inhibitory activity by complex formation, it is questionable whether the signal for cholecystokinin secretion was solely due to lowering of duodenal protease levels.", 
    "57": "We experienced a 49 years old female SAD patient who showed a good response the next day after alprazolam 1.2 mg administration. The back ground EEG of the patient showed a abnormal EEG with slow waves. The personality was colored with historical features. The nadir of body core temperature from rectum slightly delayed in remission phase compared with depressive phase. The patient became hypomania and calmed down gradually. Alprazolam treatment is seemed to be available for SAD patients.", 
    "58": "MRI has been applied to the investigation of epilepsy for 12 years. The principle role of MRI is in the definition of structural abnormalities that underly seizure disorders. Hippocampal sclerosis may be reliably identified, quantitative studies are useful for research and, in equivocal cases, for clinical purposes. A range of malformations of cortical development (MCD) may be determined. In patients with refractory partial seizures who are candidates for surgical treatment, a relevant abnormality is identifiable using MRI in 85%, it is likely that subtle MCD or gliosis accounts for the majority of the remainder. The proportion of cryptogenic cases will decrease with improvements in MRI hardware, signal acquisition techniques and post-processing methodologies. Functional MRI is used to identify the cerebral areas that are responsible for specific cognitive processes, and is of importance in planning resections close to eloquent cortical areas. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a means of investigating cerebral metabolites and some neurotransmitters, non-invasively. The concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine and choline-containing compounds may be estimated using proton MRS. Reduction of the ratio of NAA/(creatine+choline) is a feature of cerebral regions that include epileptic foci. Cerebral concentrations of GABA and glutamate, and the effects of antiepileptic drugs on these, may be estimated. Concentrations of high energy phosphate compounds, inorganic phosphate and pH may be assessed using 31P-MRS. In general, epileptic foci are associated with an increase in pH, increased inorganic phosphate and decreased phosphate monoesters. Carbon-13 spectroscopy promises to be a useful method for investigating cerebral metabolism in vivo. PET may provide data on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), glucose metabolism and the binding of specific ligands to receptors. Correlation of functional and structural imaging data is necessary for adequate interpretation. The hallmark of an epileptic focus is an area of reduced glucose metabolism, identified using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG), that is commonly more extensive than the underlying anatomical abnormality. The clinical role of 18FDG-PET requires re-evaluation in the light of the advances in structural imaging with MRI. Specific ligands are used to investigate specific receptors. Benzodiazepine and opioid receptors have been studied most. Reduced benzodiazepine receptor binding is commonly seen at an epileptic focus, in a more restricted distribution than an area of hypometabolism. Focal increases and decreases in benzodiazepine receptor binding have been demonstrated in MCD in areas that appear normal on MRI, indicating the widespread nature of the abnormalities. It has been found that mu-opioid receptors are increased in temporal neocortex overlying mesial temporal epileptic foci. Dynamic studies of ligand-receptor binding are possible using PET, for example the release of cerebral endogenous opioids has been implied at the time of serial absences. The main use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is to produce images reflecting rCBF. Interictal studies alone are not reliable. A strength of SPECT is the ability to obtain images related to rCBF at the time of seizures. Concomitant video-EEG recording is necessary. Ictal scans need to be considered in comparison with an interictal scan and an MRI. Interpretation must be cautious, but may yield data that is useful in the investigation of patients for possible surgical treatment.", 
    "59": "The influence of two anxiolytics on basal heart rate and on the evoked cardiac response elicited by auditory stimuli, was studied in humans. Diazepam (Valium) (7.5 mg) and buspirone (Buspar) (7.5 mg), which differ in their psycho-pharmacological profiles, were used. Prestimulus vigilance and cognitive load were manipulated by instructions allowing the subjects to ignore the stimuli, or requiring them to count the tones. Drug effects were obtained in subjective alertness, basal heart rate level, and the evoked cardiac response. Diazepam reduced subjective alertness, while buspirone did not. Diazepam apparently increased heart rate levels relative to placebo, in contrast to buspirone, which produced an apparent decrease in heart rate. These drug-induced prestimulus heart rate level effects were associated with differential decelerations immediately following stimulus onset and appear to reflect differences in prestimulus vigilance. Opposite effects of the drugs were also observed in the second, acceleratory, component of the of the evoked cardiac response, and these were found to be independent of the prestimulus drug effects. Compared with placebo, buspirone appeared to enhance the acceleratory component in the count condition, while diazepam led to an apparent reduction of this component. Enhancement of this acceleration after buspirone may reflect an increase in cognitive effort directed to the performance of task-relevant behaviour, while the reduction of this component after diazepam can be regarded as a cognitive-motivational neutralisation of signal value. The differential effects of the two anxiolytics support the separation of the evoked cardiac response into different components and may also have implications for the clinical use of the drugs.", 
    "60": "We examined effects of carbachol (CCh), muscarinic receptor agonist, on long-term potentiation (LTP) of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse of guinea pig hippocampal slices using extracellular recording technique. Application of 0.1 microM CCh to the slices significantly augmented the magnitude of LTP without significant change in the amplitude of pretetanus fEPSP. The enhancement of LTP by 0.1 microM CCh was significantly attenuated by 0.1 microM AF-DX 116, M2 receptor antagonist, but not by 0.1 microM pirenzepine, M1 receptor antagonist. Ten micromolar of carbachol reduced the amplitude of pretetanus fEPSP, while the magnitude of LTP was significantly larger than that in control slices to which tetanus was applied in a stimulus intensity producing pretetanus fEPSPs with an amplitude comparable to those during administration of 10 microM CCh. Neither 0.1 microM pirenzepine nor 0.1 microM AF-DX 116 had significant effect on the enhancement of LTP by 10 microM CCh. These results suggest that the induction of LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse was enhanced through the activation of M2 receptors by CCh at a lower concentration.",

    "63": "The pharmacists interviewed 7/44 consecutive patients. The highest prevalence of prescriptions for hypnotic drugs was found in the elderly and in women. The majority (96%) of prescriptions were for benzodiazepines, with lorazepam and triazolam accounting for 50%. Short-acting and ultra-short-acting benzodiazepines were more frequently prescribed for sleep induction by general practitioners (GPs) than by psychiatrists and other physicians. Frequently the benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic was also prescribed for day time sedation. Approximately 72% of subjects reported they had been taking the prescribed drug for one year or more.",

    "65": "Hyperekplexia is a rare but well-delineated clinical syndrome of pathological startle response and neonatal hypertonia. Many cases result from mutations in the alpha 1 subunit of the glycine receptor (GLRA 1).", 
    "66": "The clinical features, management and recent genetic studies of hyperekplexia are reviewed.", 
    "67": "Diagnosis of the disorder should not be difficult, if one is aware of the syndrome. The treatment of first choice is with the benzodiazepine drug clonazepam, which often causes a dramatic although incomplete diminution of startle. Both recessive and dominant mutations in GLRA 1 have been found in affected individuals. The study of mouse mutants with startle phenotypes suggests that the remainder of cases may well be due to mutations in the beta subunit of the glycine receptor.", 
    "68": "Hyperekplexia is the first human disease shown to result from mutations within a neurotransmitter gene. The demonstration of both dominant and recessive inheritance resulting from different mutations in the same gene is of considerable interest, as other neuropsychiatric disorders may result from mutations in ligand-gated ion channels. Mutation analysis of GLRA 1 is also likely to be useful as an aid to genetic counselling and in diagnostic evaluation of neonatal hypertonia.", 
    "69": "The effects of diazepam, a typical benzodiazepine receptor agonist, on gastric acid secretion were studied in both conscious pylorus-ligated rats and the perfused stomach of rats under urethane anesthesia. Diazepam did not affect acid secretion in conscious pylorus-ligated rats. Under urethane anesthesia, diazepam showed a definite stimulation on gastric acid secretion. However this stimulatory action was caused neither by 4'-chlordiazepam, which is a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonist, nor beta-carbline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester, which is an inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist. Pretreatment with atropine, hexamethonium or bilateral truncal vagotomy inhibited the diazepam-induced acid secretion. Pretreatment with flumazenil, which is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, reduced the acid secretion induced by diazepam, but pretreatment with 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide, which is a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, did not reduce the acid secretion induced by diazepam. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid, which is an inhibitor of GABA biosynthesis, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol inhibited diazepam-stimulated acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion stimulated by baclofen was not affected by flumazenil, 3-mercaptopropionic acid or picrotoxin. These results suggest that acid secretion is centrally stimulated by diazepam in rats under anesthesia, and the stimulatory action is closely associated with benzodiazepine-GABA complex receptors.", 
    "70": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam and N-demethyladinazolam (NDMAD), its major active metabolite, were compared in 39 healthy male volunteers (13 Asian, 12 Caucasian and 14 African-American). In a four-way, double-blind crossover design, subjects were administered (1) 30 mg oral adinazolam mesylate SR tablets, (2) 10 mg parenteral (i.v.) adinazolam mesylate, (3) 30 mg i.v. NDMAD and (4) placebo. Venous blood samples were collected at specific time intervals after drug administration and assayed for adinazolam and NDMAD concentrations. Sedation was rated at the time of each blood draw according to the Nurse-Rated Sedation Scale, and the digit-symbol substitution test was administered to evaluate psychomotor performance. After i.v. administration of adinazolam, Asians manifested significantly higher Cmax, larger AUC and lower CL of both adinazolam and NDMAD than their Caucasian and African-American counterparts. Likewise, after i.v. NDMAD Asians had significantly higher NDMAD Cmax and AUC than Caucasians and African-Americans. Most of these differences remained statistically significant after controlling for body surface area. With PO adinazolam, Asians also manifested substantially higher Cmax, larger AUC and lower CL for both adinazolam and NDMAD; however, with the exception of Cmax, these differences did not reach statistical significance. These results are in accordance with previous observations for ethnic-related differences in drug pharmacokinetics. In contrast, pharmacodynamic differences were not noted among the three study groups.", 
    "71": "Toxic drugs, including barbiturates and benzodiazepines, were analyzed using polyacrylamide-coated columns in capillary electrophoresis (CE). The separations were carried out in absence of electroosmotic flow. Seven kinds of barbiturates were successfully separated with the coated columns in free solution without further additives. Benzodiazepines, the electrically neutral solutes were introduced onto the coated column, and separated in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate above its critical micelle concentration in the running buffer. This CE method offered fast and efficient separation of more hydrophobic solutes, such as benzodiazepines. The separation of seven barbiturates was studied in linear (noncross-linked) polyacrylamide solutions and in acrylamide/N-isopropylacrylamide (AA/IPAA) copolymer solutions to explore the effect of isopropyl groups in the AA/IPAA copolymer chain.",

    "73": "We have found that protoporphyrin IX, which had been regarded as inactive, induces erythroid differentiation. The differentiation-inducing activities of various hemin-related compounds, including hematoporphyrin IX, mesoporphyrin IX, deuteroporphyrin IX and protoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester, suggested certain structural requirements for the activity: 1) the iron moiety of hemin is not essential, and 2) the propionic acid side chains of hemin play an important role. In addition, we have examined the influence of some bioactive factors on hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cell line. Retinoids and tubulin-disruptors dose-dependently enhanced hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells, though they did not themselves induce differentiation. Retinoid antagonists suppressed hemin-induced differentiation. The effects of hemin and/or retinoids on the mRNA expressions of oncogenes (c-myc and c-myb) and retinoic acid receptor genes (rar alpha and rar beta) of K562 cells were analyzed. We also examined the possible involvement of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells by the use of its ligands. Diazepam itself was revealed to possess differentiation-inducing activity on K562 cells. The PBR-specific ligands modified hemin-induced differentiation. These results suggest a requirement for retinoids (or retinoid-like cofactors) for hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells and the involvement of PBR in erythroid differentiation of K562 cell line.", 
    "74": "We compared the patient's response to laryngeal mask (LM) insertion and hemodynamics among three anesthesia induction methods; P group using 2.5 mg.kg-1 propofol with 0.2 microgram.kg-1 fentanyl, M group using 0.2 mg.kg-1 midazolam with 0.2 microgram. kg-1 fentanyl, B group using 5 mg.kg-1 thiopental with 0.2 microgram.kg-1 fentanyl. Each 30 patients, 35 to 65 years, for elective mastectomy were entered in three groups. Preanesthetic medication was i.m. injection of 0.5 mg atropine and 5 mg midazolam 30 min before the induction. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous injection of each dose of P, M or B in 20 sec followed by fentanyl. When verbal response disappeared, a laryngeal mask was inserted. The number of patients with difficult insertion or showing body movement or gagging were larger in the order of M group > B group > P group. Blood pressure and heart rate in the P group were significantly lower than those in the other two groups. It was concluded that P allowed the most smooth insertion of LM among the three groups, but it also induced hypotension and bradycardia.", 
    "75": "In the preoperative setting, the nurse is responsible for the comprehensive evaluation and preparation of the patient. Among these activities, the administration of various premedications to achieve a physiological (eg, raise gastric fluid pH) or psychological (eg, reduce apprehension) effect is commonplace. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine, is one of the more popular medications used preoperatively for its anxiolytic properties. Several studies have evaluated the variety of routes by which midazolam can effectively be administered to the pediatric patient. A review of midazolam as a premedication specific to the pediatric population in the ambulatory setting is presented.", 
    "76": "Unexpected awareness and memory with general anesthesia are phenomena that can occur in the intriguing interface between consciousness and unconsciousness. Studies suggest that, for some patients, cognitive processing remains active even during deep anesthesia; that is, an apparently unconscious patient still may be registering information. Although explicit memory is usually eliminated by general anesthesia, implicit or subconscious memory may remain. There is no monitor to tell where the patient lies on the continuum between consciousness and unconsciousness. \"Sleeping\" patients are vulnerable to overhearing inappropriate conversation that may have negative consequences. Post-traumatic stress disorder as well as medical malpractice litigation may result from awareness or memory during anesthesia.

    "77": "Anxiety disorders include generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia. Consideration of the chronicity of these disorders reveals that anxiety disorders first occur during early adolescence or young adulthood, and can wax and wane over periods of 5 to 10 years. Thus, in considering treatment, the emphasis must be placed on long term, rather than short term, management. Comorbidity studies reveal that untreated patients with anxiety disorders are at risk of social and psychological consequences, as well as disability resulting from comorbid and secondary disorders. Comparisons between buspirone and the benzodiazepines in treating patients with generalised anxiety disorder reveal that long term use of benzodiazepines is associated with adverse effects, particularly in elderly patients. Buspirone appears to have an onset of action equivalent to that of the benzodiazepines, to be well tolerated in the long term, to lack problems of habituation and withdrawal, and to be useful in patients with masked comorbid depression. In patients with panic disorder and social phobia, buspirone has not been clearly shown to be effective in comparison with the reference standards; in those patients with OCD, there are only preliminary indications of efficacy, which merit a more adjunctive role.", 
    "78": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of dynorphin A(1-13) on scopolamine- and pirenzepine-induced amnesia were investigated in mice by observing the step-down-type passive avoidance response and spontaneous alternation performance. The pre- or post-training, or preretention administration of dynorphin A(1-13) (0.3-10 micrograms) alone failed to affect the passive avoidance response, while scopolamine (1 mg/kg) significantly inhibited it. Dynorphin A(1-13) (1 microgram) given 15 min before training and retention tests, but not immediately after training, significantly improved the scopolamine (1 mg/kg)-induced impairment of passive avoidance response, indicating the anti-amnesic effects of dynorphin A(1-13). A lower dose (1 mg/kg) of the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist (-)-(1R,5R,9R)-5,9-diethyl-2-(3-furyl-methyl)-2'-hydroxy-6,7-benzomorpha n reversed the anti-amnesic effects of dynorphin A(1-13) (1 microgram). In contrast, although dynorphin A(1-13) (1, 3 and 10 micrograms) did not influence spontaneous alternation performance, scopolamine (1 mg/kg) and the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (3 micrograms) markedly decreased spontaneous alternation performance. Dynorphin A(1-13) (3, 5.6 and/or 10 micrograms) significantly improved the scopolamine (1 mg/kg)- and pirenzepine (3 micrograms)-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation performance. The improving effects of dynorphin A(1-13) (3 micrograms) were almost completely reversed by pretreatment with nor-binaltorphimine (4 micrograms), a kappa-selective opioid receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the stimulation of kappa-opioid receptors improves memory dysfunctions resulting from the blockade of muscarinic M1 receptors.", 
    "79": "The effects of N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl) acetamide (nefiracetam; DM-9384), on learning and memory in several amnesia animal models with neuronal dysfunctions were investigated. Nefiracetam improved scopolamine-, bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, ethanol-, chlordiazepoxide- and cycloheximide-induced amnesia. Anti-amnesic action of nefiracetam on scopolamine model was antagonized by nifedipine and flunarizine, but not by diltiazem. Repeated administration of nefiracetam to AF64A-treated animals improved impairment of learning and memory as well as the alterations in cholinergic and monoaminergic neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. Basal forebrain (BF) lesioned rats induced by excitotoxin or by thermal coagulation showed impairment of learning accompanied by a marked reduction in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholine esterase activities. Nefiracetam improved the learning deficit of the BF-lesioned rats. Nefiracetam also improved the carbon monoxide-induced delayed and acute amnesia. Nefiracetam stimulated acetylcholine release in the frontal cortex. Repeated administration of nefiracetam increased ChAT activity, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) turnover and glutamic acid decarboxylase activity, and facilitated the Na(+)-dependent high-affinity GABA uptake. Nefiracetam activated the high voltage-activated (N/L-type) Ca2+ channel. The dose-response curves of nefiracetam were bell-shaped in both behavioral and biochemical studies. Therefore, it is suggested that nefiracetam improves the dysfunction of cholinergic, GABAergic and/or monoaminergic neuronal function by acting at Ca2+ channel and enhancing the release of neurotransmitters, and modifies impairment of memory processes induced by drugs and hypoxia.", 
    "80": "The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAMP8) is a useful murine model of accelerated aging and learning deficiency. We examined bindings of [3H]pirenzepine, [3H]dizocilpine (MK-801), [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutylate (PDBu) in SAMP8 brains, and compared them to those of SAMR1 (control). In the hippocampus of SAMP8 at 12 months, bindings of [3H]pirenzepine, [3H]MK-801, [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]8-OH-DPAT and [3H]PDBu were significantly lower than those in SAMR1. In the cerebral cortex, bindings of [3H]pirenzepine, [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]8-OH-DPAT were higher in SAMP8 than in SAMR1 at 12 months. [3H]PDBu binding was decreased in both the fractions of the membrane and cytosol in the hippocampus of SAMP8. The neurochemical findings presented here support behavioral and pharmacological findings that SAMP8 is a useful model of learning dysfunction and anxiety-deficiency. The usefulness of SAMP8 in studies on cognitive enhancers is also discussed.", 
    "81": "Activation and restoration of cholinergic function remain major foci in the development of pharmacological approaches toward the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions associated with aging and dementia. Our research has been guided by the hypothesis that (re)activation of cortical cholinergic inputs is achieved as a result of trans-synaptic disinhibition of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. This approach depends on the ability of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) inverse agonists to reduce the potency of GABA to block neuronal excitation. BZR inverse agonists were found to augment cortical ACh efflux through interaction with cognition-associated activation of this system. Cortical cholinergic inputs have been implicated in the processing of behaviorally significant stimuli, i.e., attentional functions. Using a recently developed and validated task for the measurement of sustained attention, or vigilance, administration of BZR inverse agonists were found to selectively increase the number of false alarms in intact animals. However, in animals with a 50-70%, but not > 90%, loss of the cortical cholinergic inputs, treatment with BZR inverse agonists alleviated the lesion-induced impairment in sustained attention and enhanced activated cortical ACh efflux. A rational development of cognitive enhancers will benefit from experiments in which cognitive and neuropharmacological variables are assessed simultaneously, thus allowing the analysis of interactions between cognition-associated neuronal activity and the neuronal and cognitive effects of putative cognition enhancers.", 
    "82": "Behavioural disorders occur with great frequency in patients with dementia. They are the major reason for admission of these patients to nursing homes. However, there have been few controlled trials of many of the commonly used drugs to guide therapy. To treat these conditions successfully, an adequate description of target symptoms of the behaviours to be corrected and a thorough investigation to identify precipitating causes are essential. Behavioural problems in dementia patients may results from physical illnesses, adverse drug effects, environmental changes, psychiatric syndromes (i.e. depression, delirium or psychosis) or the dementing illness itself. Therapeutic strategies should address the underlying cause whenever possible. Although pharmacological therapies are commonly employed, their efficacy is often modest and adverse effects can be quite significant. Ongoing reassessments are essential to maximise symptomatic benefits and minimise adverse effects. Several trials with different drugs are often necessary before an effective therapy is found. Anticholinergic adverse effects, which occur commonly with many antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, may worsen the cognitive and memory deficits that form the primary symptoms of dementia in these patients. This article summarises the use of the various psychoactive medications that target common behavioural disturbances, including agitation, psychosis, depression and sleep disturbances, in dementia patients. General guidelines regarding dosage, potential adverse effects and duration of therapy are discussed.", 
    "83": "We compared the influence of pentobarbital (P, 60 mg/kg), urethane (U, 1.8 g/kg), and a contribution of diazepam with ketamine hydrochloride (D+K, 10 + 100 mg/kg) anesthesia on the incidence of ischemia/ reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in rats. In anesthetized rats, myocardial ischemia was produced by a 6-min ligation of the left main coronary artery, followed by 5 min of reperfusion. The incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) was markedly decreased in the D+K-anesthetized animals compared with the P-anesthetized group (VF, 46 vs. 89%; VT, 64 vs. 94%). The mean blood pressure (MBP) before coronary ligation was significantly lower in U-anesthetized animals (72 +/- 3.5 vs. 102 +/- 4.1 and 108 +/- 5.9 mm Hg in P and D+K, respectively). The MBP recovery was the best in the D+K-anesthetized group. In experimental work, pentobarbitone anesthesia may be recommended for studying arrhythmias, while the combination of diazepam and ketamine may be useful for hemodynamic investigations.", 
    "84": "In accordance with the guidelines of the European Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (ECCLS), the performance of the Abbott AxSYM Abused Drugs assays were evaluated and compared with the results provided by the following systems: Syva Emit d.a.u./Roche Cobas Mira S Plus, Abbott TDx and ADx, Syva Emit d.a.u./Syva ETS Plus, Syva Emit II/Hitachi 717 and Roche Abuscreen OnLine/Roche Cobas Mira S Plus. The test analytes, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates, benzodiazepines and barbiturates, were each investigated in three laboratories on different systems. The imprecision of all systems in the series and from day to day was good, with CVs less than 5% or 10%, respectively. The AxSYM calibration curves were stable for 3-4 months and none of the systems displayed any shift in the results of the analyses within one day or any faults caused by sample contamination. Within the framework of this study, a total of 1860 urine samples were investigated; 741 results were positive. All results which remained discrepant between AxSYM and the comparison systems after repeated analysis (n = 17) were subjected to further investigation using a reference method, with the exception of one barbiturate and two benzodiazepine samples. An additional test criterion was the practicability of the systems investigated and the versatility of the software. During this evaluation, the results provided by the Abbott AxSYM were excellent and were fully in line with the manufacturer's claims. The reliability of the FPIA technology that has been the subject of frequent investigation was also convincing during this evaluation. The possibility of semi-quantitative determination, the stability of the calibration curves, the ability to process an emergency sample without delay and its high suitability to routine operations are the convincing benefits offered by this system.",

These tests were then repeated 30 and 60 minutes after the IV injection of midazolam or placebo, and repeated 15 and 30 minutes following the injection of flumazenil. A dose-dependent effect of midazolam was seen on the PAT and CRT. Flumazenil completely reversed the psychomotor effects of midazolam in Group ML at 60 minutes but not in Group MH, and this action was clearly detected by the PAT. Psychomotor tests had returned to baseline values when the plasma concentration of midazolam was below 33 ng/ml. A marked inter-individual variation was seen on the PAT, CRT, and in the correlation between the plasma concentration and the results on the PAT.", 
    "91": "There was a dose-dependent deterioration in psychomotor performance in subjects given midazolam. The PAT was sensitive in the detection of these residual effects, but a large inter-individual variation in the psychomotor effects of midazolam was evident that could be due to pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic variability between individuals. Flumazenil in a dose of 0.5 mg IV completely reversed the effects of low-dose, but not high-dose, midazolam.", 
    "92": "1. The benzodiazepine site of the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors is distinguishable from that of the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype by its inability to interact with classical benzodiazepines (i.e., diazepam) and its agonistic response to Ro 15-1788, which behaves as an antagonist in the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype. 2. The point mutation of Arg 100 of the alpha 6 subunit to histidine (the corresponding residue in alpha 1) has been shown to enable the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype to interact with diazepam but failed in this study to abolish the ability of Ro 15-1788 to enhance GABA-induced Cl- currents. 3. Here we identified the segment of P161 to L187 of alpha 6 to contain the functional region responsible for the agonistic action of Ro 15-1788. Its replacement with the corresponding alpha 1 sequence abolished the ability of Ro 15-1788 to enhance GABA currents without appreciable effects on its binding affinity to the benzodiazepine site or on the functionality of the other benzodiazepine site ligands such as diazepam, U-92330 and 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. These data support the evidence that the functionality of a given ligand could arise from a single region of the benzodiazepine site, not shared by others. 4. In addition we have learned that several residues in the N-terminal region of alpha 6, such as R100, V142 and N143, have the ability to influence GABA-dependent Cl- current induction probably by allosterically modulating low affinity GABA sites.", 
    "93": "The social interaction test was used to examine the effects of an extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) and its possible interactions with diazepam and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE). Pairs of naive (unfamiliar) male Wistar AF rats subjected to the same treatment were placed in a novel test arena that was brightly illuminated, and the duration (in s) of social contact was observed over a 10 min period. Single injections of EGb 761 (8-16 mg/kg, i.p.), given 30 min prior to testing, or repeated oral administration of the extract (48 or 96 mg/kg/day) for 8 days, significantly decreased social contact under conditions that did not influence locomotor activity. Injection of diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before testing, significantly increased social contact. Injection of diazepam to animals that had received repeated oral treatment with EGb 761 (96 mg/kg/ day) increased social interaction to an extent greater than observed with diazepam alone. Injection of beta-CCE (2-16 mg/kg, i.p.), 15 min before testing, significantly decreased social contact. When the animals were treated with EGb 761 (48 or 96 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 8 days) and beta-CCE (4 mg/kg), both of which decreased social interaction when administered alone, the resulting level of social contact was similar to that of control animals. Interactions with certain sites of central GABAA/ benzodiazepine/Cl- channel receptor complexes could be involved in mediating these effects of EGb 761, diazepam and beta-CCE.", 
    "94": "We performed an experiment to characterize the toxicity of soman in cynomolgus monkeys when the organophosphorus intoxication was followed by a treatment with either the three-drug therapy atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam or the association atropine/HI-6/prodiazepam. Clinical, electrophysiological and histological approaches were combined. Our data demonstrate that the protection afforded against soman toxicity was better with the combination atropine/HI-6/prodiazepam compared to atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam. This was observed transiently in term of vigilance and respiratory function of intoxicated animals, but particularly in term of their EEG- and ECG disturbances. Moreover, compared to those treated with atropine/pralidoxine/diazepam, animals treated with atropine/ HI-6/prodiazepam recovered slightly sooner and did not exhibit prostration 2 days after intoxication although their rapidity of movements was not totally restored. The final recovery observed 3 weeks after intoxication was similar for the two groups. The value of the combination of atropine/HI-6/prodiazepam vs atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam to counteract soman toxicity was also confirmed in term of brain neuroprotection since greater lesions were observed with the second three drug treatment three weeks after intoxication.", 
    "95": "A comparative study between two drugs acting on the GABAA receptor, alprazolam and alpidem was undertaken, using simple tests such as measurement of spontaneous locomotor activity, four plates test and rotarod in mice. Additional conflict test was further performed using a new conflict paradigm where the opportunity existed for rats to choose during punished periods between immediate, punished reinforcement and delayed non-punished reinforcement. The benzodiazepine alprazolam, demonstrated, as expected, strong anxiolytic effects in mice and increased punished response in rats at non sedative doses (0.5, 1 mg/kg). High doses of alprazolam decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and induced myorelaxant effects in mice. Alpidem, an imidazopyridine derivative, induced motor impairment in mice and only very weak anxiolytic effects in the four plates test in mice (4 mg/kg) and in punished procedure in rats (32 mg/kg). As alprazolam is a full agonist for the GABAA receptor complex and alpidem is a partial agonist acting with specificity on omega 1 GABAA receptor subtypes, the results are discussed. Activity on omega 1 receptor subtypes is perhaps not sufficient in order to obtain a true anti-conflict effect and compounds such as alpidem only relieve some of the symptoms of anxiety disorders.", 
    "96": "In follow-up to recent work on benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide) and selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors (maprotiline and fluvoxamine), the present study compares the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, buspirone (0.75-3.0 mg/kg), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron (0.1-100 micrograms/kg), and the novel antidepressant, tianeptine (2.5-10.0 mg/kg), on the behaviour of mice in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. Compounds were administered daily for 21 days prior to testing, and an ethological scoring technique was used to generate comprehensive behavioural profiles. Results show that subchronic treatment with ondansetron failed to influence the behaviour of mice in the plus-maze, while the limited changes induced by buspirone could not be attributed to anxiety-related processes. In contrast, tianeptine produced unambiguous anxiogenic-like effects at the top dose tested (10.0 mg/kg), a profile that was not secondary to changes in general levels of locomotor activity or exploration. Data are discussed in relation to current pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depressive disorders, and the nature of anxiety induced by animal models.",

Compounds were given daily to mice for 21 days prior to testing and the subsequent behaviour of the animals during social interactions was assessed by ethopharmacological procedures. Buspirone, at 0.75 mg/kg, increased immobility and reduced occurrence of the aggressive act, \"attack.\" At 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg, it enhanced olfactory exploration of the sawdust substrate, but had no effect on social investigation. Ondansetron increased the duration of environmental exploration at 0.1 microgram/kg, while at 100 micrograms/kg it increased the duration of digging in the substrate. Ondansetron had no effect on the categories of behaviour and failed to induce an anxiolytic-like enhancement of social investigation. Tianeptine produced an anxiogenic-like effect at 10 mg/kg, while at 5 mg/kg it enhanced flight and immobility. The relevance of these findings is discussed in relation of the reported behavioural actions of these compounds and to current pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depression. The apparent anxiogenic effect of tianeptine is a novel finding which requires further study.", 
    "98": "The GABAA-receptor agonist neuroactive steroid 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-P) has anxiolytic and locomotor stimulant effects and shares some subjective properties with benzodiazepines, barbiturates and ethanol, but there have been no studies of its reinforcing or rewarding effects. The present study examined the rewarding properties of 3 alpha,5 alpha-P using the conditioned place preference paradigm. Male DBA/2J mice received four pairings of a distinctive floor stimulus with 3 alpha,5 alpha-P (3.2, 10 or 17 mg/kg, IP) in an unbiased conditioning procedure. On alternate days a different distinctive floor was paired with vehicle. At the lowest dose (3.2 mg/kg), there was no difference between conditioning subgroups in preference for the drug-paired floor type, indicating an absence of place conditioning. However, a dose-dependent conditioned preference was evident at the higher doses as shown by the greater amount of time spent on the floor paired with 3 alpha,5 alpha-P. In addition, 3 alpha,5 alpha-P produced a dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity, which was significant following the 17 mg/kg dose. A control study showed no effect of the beta-cyclodextrin vehicle on place conditioning in the absence of neurosteroid. These results provide the first demonstration that 3 alpha,5 alpha-P, an endogenous modulator of GABAA receptor function, possesses rewarding properties using the conditioned place preference paradigm.",

Animals were handled gently by the body, injected i.p. with saline solution, 2 ml/kg, and tested independently in the defensive burying as well as in the elevated plus-maze test at different times after the i.p. injection: 1.5, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. A transient effect of i.p. saline injection was observed (i.e., increased DB in animals tested 1.5 min after injection) and a decrease in this parameter when studied 3 min after the injection. No changes at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after the injection were found. To discriminate the putative participation of the opiate peptide and benzodiazepine receptors in the actions of the i.p. injection, flumazenil (5 mg/kg) and nalozone (1 mg/kg) were administered. The increase in DB at 1.5 min was masked by double injection, an effect blocked by naloxone, but not by flumazenil, while both of them reverted the decrease in DB response in animals tested 3 min after injection. A partial action of the i.p. in the animals tested in the elevated plus-maze test was found. Present results are discussed on the basis of behavioral and pharmacological evidence.",

    "101": "Presurgical evaluation was performed in 23 patients, who were considered candidates for temporal lobe resective surgery (14 females and nine males with a median age of 34 (range 13 to 50) years). The presurgical diagnosis was based on seizure semiology as demonstrated with ictal video recording, ictal and interictal scalp EEG recordings, and MRI.", 
    "102": "Eighteen patients had convergent findings in clinical semiology, interictal and ictal EEG with scalp and sphenoidal electrodes, and MRI that warranted surgery without depth EEG (DEEG). In five patients with insufficient precision of localisation, DEEG with intracerebral and subdural electrodes was performed. MRI showed abnormalities in 22 out of 23 patients. Of these 22, 18 had mesial temporal sclerosis. This was limited to the mesial temporal lobe in four and more widespread in the temporal lobe in 14 patients. In one patient only enlargement of the temporal horn was found and in three others only white matter lesions were detected. 18FDG PET showed a large area of glucose hypometabolism in the epileptogenic temporal lobe, with an extension outside the temporal lobe in 10 of 23 patients. Only in one of these patients DEEG showed extratemporal abnormalities that were concordant with a significant extratemporal extension of hypometabolism in 18FDG PET. 18FDG PET was compared with the results of scalp EEG: in none of the patients was an anterior temporal ictal onset in scalp EEG related to a maximum hypometabolism in the mesial temporal area. By contrast, the region of abnormality indicated by 11C-flumazenil PET was much more restricted, also when compared with DEEG findings. Extension of abnormality outside the lobe of surgery was seen in only two patients with 11C-flumazenil and was less pronounced compared with the intratemporal abnormality. Both 18FDG PET and 11C-flumazenil PET reliably indicated the epileptogenic temporal lobe. Thus these techniques provide valuable support for the presurgical diagnosis, especially in patients with non-lesional MRI or non-lateralising or localising scalp EEG recordings. In those patients in whom phase 1 presurgical evaluation on the basis of classic methods does not allow a localisation of the epileptogenic area, PET studies may provide valuable information for the strategy of the implantation of intracranial electrodes for DEEG. Previous studies have suggested that 11C-flumazenil binding has a closer spatial relationship with the zone of ictal onset than the area of glucose hypometabolism, but this study suggests rather that the decrease in the 11C-flumazenil binding simply reflects a loss of neurons expressing the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor. 11C-flumazenil PET did not prove to be superior to 18FDG PET.",

In 17 mesial temporal sclerosis, in one an oligodendroglioma grade B, in another a vascular malformation and in two patients no abnormalities were found. Although all 21 patients with pathological abnormality showed hypometabolic zones with 18FDG PET and a decreased uptake in 11C-flumazenil binding, there was no strong correlation between pathological diagnosis and functional abnormal areas in PET. Grading of medial temporal sclerosis according to the Wyler criteria showed no correlation with the degree of hypometabolism in either 18FDG or 11C-flumazenil PET. The interictal 123I-iomazenil SPECT technique was highly inaccurate in localising the lobe of surgery.",

More than 80% of patients were treated with up to 300 mg ranitidine daily; the remaining patients received doses of up to 1200 mg daily. Eighty-seven trials were placebo controlled. Analyses of post-marketing surveillance and a database of all spontaneously reported adverse events were also evaluated.", 
    "114": "Overall in the clinical trial programme adverse events were reported by 20% of those receiving ranitidine compared with 27% of those receiving placebo. The pattern of events was similar in all treatment groups with no evidence of dose-related toxicity in regimens encompassing an eightfold range of therapeutic doses. Similarly in a programme of studies designed to evaluate a dose of ranitidine of 75 mg for non-prescription (over-the-counter) use in the treatment of heartburn, ranitidine was not associated with an adverse event profile distinct from that of placebo. Analysis of spontaneously reported adverse event data allowed identification of rare idiosyncratic events.", 
    "115": "Review of data from a large population of controlled clinical trials with analyses of postmarketing surveillance studies and spontaneously reported adverse events confirmed the excellent safety profile of ranitidine.",

    "117": "We examined the binding properties of YF476 to the rat brain, cloned canine and cloned human gastrin/CCK-B receptors, and the effect of YF476 on secretagogue-induced gastric acid secretion in rats and Heidenhain pouch dogs.", 
    "118": "YF476 replaced the specific binding of [125I]CCK-8 to the rat brain, cloned canine and cloned human gastrin/CCK-B receptors, with Ki values of 0.068, 0.62 and 0.19 nM, respectively. The affinity of YF476 for rat brain gastrin/CCK-B receptor was 4100-fold higher than that for rat pancreatic CCK-A receptor. In anaesthetized rats, intravenous YF476 inhibited pentagastrin-induced acid secretion with an ED50 value of 0.0086 micromol/kg, but did not affect histamine- and bethanechol-induced acid secretion at a dose of 10 micromol/kg. In Heidenhain pouch dogs, intravenous and oral YF476 inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values of 0.018 and 0.020 micromol/kg, respectively, but did not affect histamine-induced acid secretion.", 
    "119": "These results suggest that YF476 is an extremely potent and highly selective gastrin/CCK-B receptor antagonist, and that the gastrin/CCK-B receptor is not involved in histamine- or bethanechol-induced gastric acid secretion in dogs or rats.",

In the withdrawal analysis, 44 (33%) of 133 baseline antipsychotic users were withdrawn. Factors at baseline predicting successful withdrawal were low antipsychotic dose, no use of benzodiazepines or antidepressants, and behavioral symptoms score below the median. However, although an additional 22 patients had dose reductions > or = 50%, none of the predictors of withdrawal were associated with dose reductions.",

Patients who are poor candidates for total antipsychotic withdrawal may tolerate substantial dose reductions, which should reduce their risk of adverse antipsychotic effects.", 
    "135": "The present study provides a detailed kinetic analysis of diazepam metabolism by all four known members of the human P4502C subfamily expressed from their cDNAs in Escherichia coli. Both P4502C18 and P4502C19 were found to be low K(M) diazepam N-demethylases with apparent K(M) values of 24 +/- 4 microM and 21 +/- 3 microM, respectively. These values closely resemble the low K(M) component of diazepam N-demethylase activity exhibited by human liver microsomes. In addition, P4502C19 also catalyzed diazepam 3-hydroxylation with a K(M) value of 21 +/- 9 microM. Although P4502C8 was essentially inactive in catalyzing diazepam metabolism, P4502C9 catalyzed the N-demethylation with a relatively high K(M) of 80 +/- 15 microM and an overall 3- to 6-fold lower catalytic efficiency, compared with P4502C18 and P4502C19, respectively. At a substrate concentration of 10 microM, diazepam N-demethylation in a panel of human liver microsomes was inhibited 42 +/- 12% (mean +/- SD, N = 6) by a polyclonal anti-CYP2C antibody. In the same experiment, 3-hydroxylation remained unaffected (<10% inhibition). 1 microM of the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole inhibited 37 +/- 19% of the N-demethylation and 86 +/- 5% of 3-hydroxylation. Estimates of relative contributions to diazepam N-demethylation of P4502C9 (8 +/- 4%), P4502C18 (<2%), and P4502C19 (33 +/- 14%) and to diazepam 3-hydroxylation of P4502C19 (9 +/- 3%) based on the kinetic parameters of the recombinant enzymes and on specific contents of the individual 2C P450s determined in immunoblots are consistent with the inhibition data. In conclusion, these data confirm that both P4502C19 and P4503A are major contributors to human liver microsomal diazepam N-demethylation at low substrate concentrations, whereas P4503A is the major enzyme responsible for 3-hydroxylation.", 
    "136": "Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine derivative which displays efficacy in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses. It has structural and pharmacological properties resembling those of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and an improved tolerability profile compared with the classical antipsychotic haloperidol. In several large, well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses, olanzapine generally 5 to 20 mg/day was at least as effective as haloperidol (5 to 20mg) and more so than placebo, as assessed by overall rating scales for psychoses. Olanzapine improved negative symptoms to a greater extent than haloperidol in 2 of 3 comparative trials, including the largest trial. Efficacy of olanzapine has a rapid onset (within 1 to 2 weeks). Its clinical benefits appear to be maintained for treatment periods of up to 1 year, as shown by analysis of the extension phase of several trials demonstrating decreased probability of hospitalisation over this period compared with haloperidol. Preliminary data suggest the drug may also improve quality of life. Olanzapine was associated with significantly fewer adverse movement disorders (e.g. akathisia, dystonia, hypertonia, extrapyramidal symptoms) than haloperidol. There have been no reports of agranulocytosis (as occurs with clozapine) or any other haemotoxicity attributed to olanzapine, and the drug has shown minimal effect on prolactin levels. Transient increases in levels of hepatic transaminases seem to be clinically important. The only events recorded more frequently during olanzapine than during haloperidol therapy were weight gain, dry mouth and increased appetite. Although the antipsychotic activity of olanzapine has been well demonstrated. Its efficacy in refractory schizophrenia and its place relative to other atypical antipsychotics remain to be determined. Nevertheless, if the long term tolerability profile of olanzapine is confirmed, the drug should provide a valuable therapeutic alternative in the management of schizophrenia and related psychoses.", 
    "137": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors have been shown in some endocrine tissues, namely the testis, the adrenal gland, and the pituitary gland. In this work we evaluated whether peripheral benzodiazepine receptors can be found in the purified human pancreatic islets and whether they may have a role in insulin release. Binding of the isoquinoline compound [3H]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-1-methyl-propyl)-3- isoquinolinecarboxamide (13H]PK-11195) a specific ligand of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, to cellular membranes was saturable and Scatchard's analysis of the saturation curve demonstrated the presence of a single population of binding sites, with an affinity constant value of 9.20 +/- 0.80 nM and a maximum number of binding sites value of 8913 +/- 750 fmol/mg of proteins. PK-11195 and 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-(p-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4- benzodiazepine-2-on (Ro 5-4864) significantly potentiated insulin secretion from freshly isolated human islets at 3.3 mM glucose. These results show the presence of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in purified human pancreatic islets and suggest their role in the mechanisms of insulin release.", 
    "138": "In this HPLC-diode-array detection method for toxicological drug screening, a mixed-mode solid-phase extraction procedure is optimized for isolation of a broad range of drugs from serum and urine. Basic, neutral, and weakly acidic drugs are uniformly recovered. The extract from the solid-phase cartridge is readily injected to a reversed-phase HPLC column for separation by gradient elution. Unknown drugs and metabolites in urine and serum samples from acute drug poisoning cases are rapidly identified by matching their retention times and ultraviolet spectra with hundreds of reference compounds in the library. Urine metabolites of common toxicants from various medications and drugs of abuse are recorded, with their changes of retention times and ultraviolet spectra as related to their metabolic transformations. Glucuronide conjugates of common benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and beta-blockers are examined directly without chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis. The system is reliable for diverse clinical investigations of drug overdoses, drug-induced psychoses, and substance abuse.", 
    "139": "The mechanisms by which short-term ethanol administration alters pancreatic exocrine function are unknown. We have evaluated the effects of ethanol administration on pancreatic secretion of digestive enzymes. In our studies, anesthetized as well as conscious rats were given ethanol at a rate sufficient to cause the blood ethanol concentration to reach levels associated with clinical intoxication. Ethanol was administered over a 2-h period during which blood ethanol levels remained stably elevated. We report that intravenous administration of ethanol results in a transient increase in pancreatic amylase output and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) levels. The ethanol-induced increase in amylase output can be completely inhibited by the CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718 and partially inhibited by the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine. The ethanol-induced rise in amylase output can be completely prevented by instillation of trypsin into the duodenum or by lavage of the duodenum with saline during ethanol administration. Furthermore, the intraduodenal activity of a CCK-releasing factor is increased by infusion of ethanol. These studies indicate that administration of ethanol causes rat pancreatic exocrine secretion to increase. This phenomenon is mediated by a trypsin-sensitive CCK-releasing factor which is present within the duodenal lumen. These observations lead us to speculate that repeated CCK-mediated ethanol-induced stimulation of pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion may play a role in the events which link ethanol abuse to the development of pancreatic injury.", 
    "140": "GABAergic synaptic responses were studied by direct, monosynaptic activation of GABAergic interneurons in the CA1 region of in vitro hippocampal slices from rats made tolerant to the benzodiazepine, flurazepam. Monosynaptic IPSPs were elicited in CA1 pyramidal neurons, following 1 week oral flurazepam administration, by electrical stimulation at the stratum oriens/stratum pyramidale or stratum radiatum/ stratum-lacanosum border < or = 0.5 mm from the recording electrode plane. Excitatory input to pyramidal cells and interneurons was eliminated by prior superfusion of the glutamate receptor antagonists, APV (50 microM) and DNQX (10 microM). GABAA receptor-mediated early IPSPs were further isolated by perfusion of the GABAB antagonist, CGP 35348 (25 microM) or by diffusion of Cs- from the recording electrode. GABAB receptor-mediated late IPSPs were pharmacologically isolated by perfusion of the GABAA antagonist, picrotoxin (50 microM). There was a significant decrease in the amplitude of pharmacologically isolated early and late IPSPs in FZP-treated neurons without a change in passive membrane properties. A shift of the early IPSP, but not the late IPSP, reversal potential in FZP-treated neurons suggested that a change in the driving force for anions, presumably Cl, in CA1 neurons was one important factor related to the decreased early IPSP amplitude after prolonged activation of GABAA receptors by flurazepam. A decreased early IPSP amplitude accompanied by a decreased late IPSP amplitude suggested that presynaptic GABA release onto FZP-treated pyramidal cells may also be reduced. We conclude from these data that an impairment of GABAergic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons associated with the development of tolerance during chronic benzodiazepine treatment may be related to the regulation of both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms at the GABA synapse.",

    "142": "Descriptive statistical data were collected by routine clerical processes at a VA medical center. Patients' outcomes were operationally defined to include completion of the detoxification program, dropout or discharge, or re-enrollment in the program; admission to inpatient detoxification; and referral to, entry into, and completion of substance abuse rehabilitation after detoxification. Outcomes were determined for 517 of the 577 patients consecutively referred to the program during nine months in 1995. Patients met established criteria for mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome.",

Twenty patients dropped out, 19 were discharged, 37 re-enrolled, and 25 were admitted for inpatient detoxification. Of the 453 patients who completed outpatient detoxification, 434 were referred for further treatment; 415 entered and 322 completed the next treatment phase.", 
    "144": "The completion rate for patients in the outpatient detoxification program and rates for continuing and completing further treatment were higher than in previous studies. Measures of poor short-term outcome (dropout, re-enrollment, and admission to inpatient detoxification) also compared favorably with previous studies. Unique factors contributing to outcomes included systematic screening, medical protocols for detoxification, psychosocial therapies, program-supported housing, and attention to patient satisfaction.", 
    "145": "Although some promising results have been achieved by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, an effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease still remains an important goal. Sitoindosides VII-X, and withaferin-A, isolated from aqueous methanol extract from the roots of cultivated varieties of Withania somnifera (known as Indian Ginseng), as well as Shilajit, a pale-brown to blackish brown exudation from steep rocks of the Himalaya mountain, are used in Indian medicine to attenuate cerebral functional deficits, including amnesia, in geriatric patients. The present investigation was conducted to assess whether the memory-enhancing effects of plant extracts from Withania somnifera and Shilajit are owing to neurochemical alterations of specific transmitter systems. Therefore, histochemistry to analyse acetylcholinesterase activity as well as receptor autoradiography to detect cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor subtypes were performed in brain slices from adult male Wistar rats, injected intraperitoneally daily with an equimolar mixture of sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin-A (prepared from Withania somnifera) or with Shilajit, at doses of 40 mg/kg of body weight for 7 days. Administration of Shilajit led to reduced acetylcholinesterase staining, restricted to the basal forebrain nuclei including medial septum and the vertical limb of the diagonal band. Systemic application of the defined extract from Withania somnifera, however, led to differential effects on AChE activity in basal forebrain nuclei: slightly enhanced AChE activity was found in the lateral septum and globus pallidus, whereas in the vertical diagonal band AChE activity was reduced following treatment with sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin-A. These changes were accompanied by enhanced M1-muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in lateral and medial septum as well as in frontal cortices, whereas the M2-muscarinic receptor binding sites were increased in a number of cortical regions including cingulate, frontal, piriform, parietal and retrosplenial cortex. Treatment with Shilajit or the defined extract from Withania somnifera affected neither GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding nor NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptor subtypes in any of the cortical or subcortical regions studied. The data suggest that Shilajit and the defined extract from Withania somnifera affect preferentially events in the cortical and basal forebrain cholinergic signal transduction cascade. The drug-induced increase in cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptor capacity might partly explain the cognition-enhancing and memory-improving effects of extracts from Withania somnifera observed in animals and humans.", 
    "146": "Neurosteroid modulatory sites present in the GABA(A) receptor complex in chick optic lobe were investigated, in order to evaluate whether allopregnanolone and alphaxalone act through a common site of action. Results showed that either allopregnanolone or alphaxalone present a single-component enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding with EC50 of 1.18 +/- 0.12 and 6.56 +/- 0.86 microM and Emax of 82.18 +/- 5.80 and 62.98 +/- 3.73%, respectively. Epipregnanolone behaved as a partial agonist of these steroid modulatory sites with EC50 of 0.49 +/- 0.15 microM and Emax 12.34 +/- 1.03%. Moreover, the addition of 16 microM epipregnanolone to either allopregnanolone or alphaxalone decreased EC50 values to 0.54 +/- 0.09 and 1.24 +/- 0.25 microM respectively, while Emax values were not significantly affected. On the other hand, additivity experiments disclosed that a maximal concentration (16 microM) of alphaxalone in the presence of allopregnanolone failed to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding in excess of that produced by allopregnanolone alone. Results indicate that not only allopregnanolone and alphaxalone act through a common site of action, but such site is highly stereospecific with regard to the neurosteroid spatial configuration."
