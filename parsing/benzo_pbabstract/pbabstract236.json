We hypothesized that positron-emission tomography (PET) with the carbon-11-labeled, R-enantiomer form of PK11195 ([(11)C](R)-PK11195) could image brain macrophages and hence the development of encephalitis in vivo. [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding was assessed in the brain using PET in 11 SIV infected macaques, six of which showed increased binding in vivo. Postmortem examination of the brain in these six macaques demonstrated encephalitis, while macaques that did not show an increase in [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding did not develop SIV encephalitis. Brain tissue from SIV encephalitic macaques also showed increased [(3)H](R)-PK11195 binding compared with binding in nonencephalitic macaques. Increased PK11195 binding in vivo and in postmortem brain tissue correlated with abundance of macrophages but not astrocytes. Our results suggest that PET [(11)C](R)-PK11195 imaging can detect the presence of macrophages in SIV encephalitis in vivo and may be useful to predict the development of HIV encephalitis and in studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of HIV dementia.", 
    "1": "The present study was performed to evaluate the central nervous system inhibitory effects of the essential oil from SuHeXiang Wan (Storax pill), a prescription usually used for treating epilepsy in traditional Chinese medicine, on fragrance inhalation (aroma therapy). Preinhalation of the fragrance oil markedly delayed the appearance of pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion, but showed weak activities on picrotoxin- and strychnine-induced convulsions, which implies this drug may inhibit the convulsion by GABAergic neuromodulation. This essential oil inhibited the binding of [(3)H]Ro15-1788, a selective antagonist for the benzodiazepine receptor and also the binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam, a selective agonist for the receptor, in the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and NaCl, showing a positive GABA shift, which suggested the strong possibility of the agonistic activity of the essential oil to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in rat cerebral cortices. Furthermore, inhalation inhibited the activity of GABA transaminase as the inhalation period was lengthened. The GABA level was significantly increased and glutamate content was significantly decreased in mouse brain by preinhalation of the essential oil. The above results suggest that the anticonvulsive effect of this essential oil can also originate from the enhancement of GABA level in the mouse brain, because convulsion depends partially on GABA concentration which can be properly preserved by inhibiting GABA transaminase. Fragrance inhalation progressively prolonged the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time as inhalation time was lengthened and inhibited brain lipid peroxidation, to which the anticonvulsive action is attributed; this also supported the above results, confirming the inhibitory effects of the essential oil of SuHeXiang Wan on the CNS via the GABAergic system.",

    "14": "The atypical antipsychotic drug amisulpride is a benzamide with specific antagonistic properties, which target dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors, preferentially in the limbic system. Amisulpride is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all body systems with little binding to plasma proteins. Elimination occurs mainly through the kidneys as unchanged drug. In contrast, hepatic metabolism is of minor significance and primarily yields two inactive metabolites. Very little is known about the plasma concentrations of amisulpride in patients at varying oral doses or about clinically relevant interactions with co-medication. The aim of the present investigation was to elucidate the factors, which affect amisulpride levels in schizophrenic patients. The plasma amisulpride levels of 85 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (mean age: 34.0+/-11.4 years; 40 women, 45 men) were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection. The average daily dose of amisulpride was 772.3 mg (S.D. 346.7 mg) and the mean amisulpride plasma concentration was 424.4 ng/ml (S.D. 292.8 ng/ml). The interindividual variance of the amisulpride plasma concentration was high; furthermore, the plasma concentration increased linearly with the daily oral dose (r=0.50, p<0.001). Age and gender showed a significant effect on the dose-corrected amisulpride plasma concentrations-older patients and women had higher dose-corrected amisulpride plasma concentrations than younger patients and men. However, cigarette consumption had no effect on the amisulpride plasma concentrations. Regarding co-medication with lithium and/or clozapine, significantly higher amisulpride plasma concentrations were found as compared to monotherapy, whereas other co-medications such as benzodiazepines and various conventional antipsychotics had no effect on the amisulpride plasma concentrations. The results, the possible pathomechanisms and the clinical relevance are discussed. The findings need to be confirmed in larger patient samples and with a wider range of co-medications.", 
    "15": "Attentional deficits have been implicated in the pathophysiology of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. Since the latency of the P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) is considered to be a sensitive measure of stimulus classification speed, while its amplitude-a measure of attentional resource allocation when memory updating is engaged, the present study focuses on the comparison of P300 between healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients experiencing auditory hallucinations and treated with clozapine and olanzapine.", 
    "16": "The auditory P300 was assessed during the anticipatory period of a short memory test, in 16 male hallucinated schizophrenic patients and 13 male normal subjects matched for age and educational level. The patients were reexamined under identical conditions when their hallucinations had resolved following treatment with clozapine (8 patients) and olanzapine (8 patients).", 
    "17": "The patients with hallucinations exhibited significantly reduced P300 amplitude at leads Fp1, F3, (C3-T5)/2, F4, Cz and Fz, when compared to the normal controls and at leads Fp1, F3, F4, (C4-T6)/2, C4, P4, Cz and Fz when compared to themselves during the remission phase. However logistic regression models revealed that the most important leads, differentiating the patient group before treatment either with the healthy controls, or with itself after treatment, were that at the left temporoparietal and at the left prefrontal area. Memory performance of the patient group, even after treatment and in spite of its significant improvement, remained significantly less than that of healthy controls. both antipsychotic agents had similar effects on the p300 amplitude and memory performance.", 
    "18": "These findings indicate that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia manifest abnormal aspects of attention, mediated by a distributed network involving or affecting the left temporoparietal and left prefrontal area. Additionally, the present study points to an improvement of attentional function in schizophrenic patients experiencing auditory hallucinations, both in the clozapine group but also in the olanzapine group.", 
    "19": "Microglial activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS and can be detected in animal models of the disease that demonstrate increased survival when treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. PK11195 is a ligand for the \"peripheral benzodiazepine binding site\" expressed by activated microglia. Ten ALS patients and 14 healthy controls underwent [(11)C](R)-PK11195 PET of the brain. Volumes of interest were defined to obtain [(11)C](R)-PK11195 regional binding potential values for motor and \"extra-motor\" regions. Significantly increased binding was found in motor cortex (P = 0.003), pons (P = 0.004), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P = 0.010) and thalamus (P = 0.005) in the ALS patients, with significant correlation between binding in the motor cortex and the burden of upper motor neuron signs clinically (r = 0.73, P = 0.009). These findings indicate that cerebral microglial activation can be detected in vivo during the evolution of ALS, and support the previous observations that cerebral pathology is widespread. They also argue for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory pathways.", 
    "20": "A simple, rapid and reliable reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the separation and determination of psycotropic substances viz., alprazolam, chloral hydrate and diazepam in traditional alcoholic beverages, such as toddy, has been developed. Separation was accomplished using a reversed-phase C18 column with water-methanol-acetic acid (35:65:0.1 v/v/v) as a mobile solvent and a photo-diode array detector at 210 nm. The limits of detection of alprazolam, chloral hydrate and diazepam were determined to be 0.8, 4.5 and 0.4 microg, respectively. The validity of the method was checked by analyzing nearly 200 samples collected from different outlets by enforcement authorities, and the extent of adulteration was determined.", 
    "21": "Lorazepam is a drug that has been widely used for over 30 years. Whereas its therapeutic and amnestic effects are fairly well known, the visuo-perceptual impairments induced by this drug have been studied to a much lesser degree and only little is known about the influence of lorazepam on the time course of visual information processing. To gain a better insight specifically on these temporal characteristics, we used the recently discovered backward masking technique, 'shine-through', in which a vernier target precedes a grating. We tested subjects, treated with lorazepam, diazepam, or a placebo, with masking gratings of various spatial layouts. Our experiments reveal surprising results. First, for the unmasked vernier target, lorazepam induced a strong deterioration of performance compared to both diazepam and placebo. Performance deteriorated even more significantly if a masking grating was presented following the vernier. We observed that vernier discrimination could be completely abolished even if the grating appeared 400 ms after the vernier presentation. Such long time intervals are beyond usual visual masking effects. When performing the task under placebo, the participants perceived the vernier target and the masking grating as two independent time events rather than as a single event. It appears that lorazepam prolongs dramatically the processing of visual targets. The masking effects revealed here are specific to the type of grating and are much stronger under lorazepam than under diazepam.",

It is not clear to what extent midazolam administration or the insertion of the TEE probe itself is responsible for the respiratory and hemodynamic depression during TEE examinations. We compared the performance of TEE with versus without midazolam to elucidate the effects of each.", 
    "23": "Patients were given the choice of having midazolam prior to their TEE. Thirty-one patients preferred to have sedation (Sed+) and 31 others declined sedation (Sed-). Both groups had SaO(2) and blood pressure measured before the study, following sedation (in Sed+) and at the end of the TEE study.", 
    "24": "Increase in HR was greater in Sed+ than in Sed- (12 +/- 19% vs 6 +/- 11%, both P < 0.05). There was a greater decrease in saturation of O(2) in Sed+ than in Sed- (3 +/- 3% vs 2 +/- 3%, both P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased in Sed- by 6 +/- 11% (P< 0.05) but dropped in Sed+ immediately after sedation (16 +/- 8%, P < 0.000001). Diastolic blood pressure decreased in Sed+ after sedation by 11 +/- 9% (P < 0.05).", 
    "25": "Midazolam sedation before TEE examinations causes more prominent tachycardia and depression of SaO(2)than insertion of the TEE probe alone. It also causes a substantial drop in SBP. Midazolam should be offered only to hemodynamically stable patients without preceding respiratory depression.",

    "29": "All horses were anesthetized for 2.5 hours using halothane, and a month later abdominal surgery was performed using the same anesthetic technique with a similar duration. The schedule of anesthesia included pre-medication with diazepam (0.1 mg kg(-1) IM), followed by xylazine (2.2 mg kg(-1) IV), and 10 minutes later anesthesia was induced with ketamine hydrochloride (2.2 mg kg(-1) IV). After orotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with halothane. Blood samples for the determination of thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) were obtained before, at induction, at 60 minutes after halothane was first inspired, and at recovery from anesthesia as well as at the corresponding stages of the experimental abdominal surgery (before induction, prior to laparotomy, enterectomy, enteroanastomosis, abdominal wall closure).", 
    "30": "Baseline value for the anesthesia group was 76 +/- 12 pg mL(-1) and increased (p < 0.001) after 1 hour of anesthesia to 265 +/- 40 pg mL(-1). With surgery, the corresponding value was 285 +/- 21 pg mL(-1) (hour 1, p < 0.001) and 210 +/- 28 pg mL(-1) (hour 2, p < 0.001), respectively. These were not different from anesthesia alone.", 
    "31": "The increased concentrations of thromboxane B(2) between 1 and 2.5 hours of halothane anesthesia and during the corresponding stages of the surgical intervention suggested that the anesthetic technique caused a significant increase in thromboxane B(2) and that surgery did not appear to contribute to this response.",

    "34": "Twenty-four beagle dogs, 1.1 +/- 0.3 years of age and weighing 10.9 +/- 2.7 kg.", 
    "35": "Dogs were allocated to receive one of four anesthetic protocols: 1 - pre-medication with acepromazine and butorphanol, induction with thiopental; 2 - pre-medication with acepromazine and butorphanol, induction with propofol; 3 - pre-medication with medetomidine and butorphanol, induction with propofol; and 4 - pre-medication with medetomidine and butorphanol, induction with ketamine and diazepam. Anesthesia was then maintained with halothane. At laparotomy, the spleen length, width, and height were measured, these were measured again just prior to closure of the abdomen. Splenic area and volume were calculated. Hematocrit and total serum protein (TSP) were measured before and after induction and during laparotomy.", 
    "36": "Splenic volume was greatest after protocol 4 (161.2 +/- 40.2 cm(3); p < 0.05) and was least after protocol 2. The differences in volume were because of differences in length, width, and height between groups. There was no significant change in area, length, or width over the study period. Hematocrit decreased significantly in all dogs but at different times. The decrease occurred after pre-medication if acepromazine was administered, at induction following protocol 3 and during surgery following protocol 4.", 
    "37": "If splenic volume is to be minimized during surgery, then acepromazine and propofol should be used in the anesthetic protocol. The administration of medetomidine, diazepam, and ketamine will produce a greater splenic volume. Lack of correlation between hematocrit and spleen size following the anesthetic protocols studied suggests sequestration of red blood cells in nonsplenic sites.", 
    "38": "The spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms ranges from such minor symptoms as insomnia and tremulousness to severe complications such as withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Although the history and physical examination usually are sufficient to diagnose alcohol withdrawal syndrome, other conditions may present with similar symptoms. Most patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal can be treated safely and effectively as outpatients. Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of medications that are cross-tolerant with alcohol. Benzodiazepines, the agents of choice, may be administered on a fixed or symptom-triggered schedule. Carbamazepine is an appropriate alternative to a benzodiazepine in the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Medications such as haloperidol, beta blockers, clonidine, and phenytoin may be used as adjuncts to a benzodiazepine in the treatment of complications of withdrawal. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal should be followed by treatment for alcohol dependence.", 
    "39": "The introduction of new antipsychotics has resulted in the availability of drugs with improved safety and tolerability as well as proven efficacy compared to the older antipsychotics. New compounds might show new or different adverse effects that arise in the post-marketing phase when a greater number of patients are treated. One goal of the drug safety program in psychiatry AMSP ( Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie) is the detection and description of severe, new, or rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Between 1993 and 2000, 122,562 patients were monitored in 35 psychiatric institutions, 86,349 patients of which received antipsychotics. Hyperglycemia related to antipsychotics was observed in association with only two compounds so far: clozapine and olanzapine (clozapine 2 cases, olanzapine 7 cases). In 6 of 9 patients, weight gain preceded hyperglycemia. The relative frequency of these adverse drug related events was 0.013 % for clozapine and 0.075 % for olanzapine. The symptomatology included reversible hyperglycemia, worsening of existing diabetes, and new-onset diabetes. Control for glycemic dysregulation should be maintained in clinical practice with these drugs.", 
    "40": "From 1979 to 1989 the AMUP study (AMUP = Arzneimittel\u00fcberwachung in der Psychiatrie) was conducted in two psychiatric hospitals in Germany with the aim to provide a systematic and standardized assessment of all adverse reactions to psychotropic drugs under conditions of routine practice. A total of 60.7 % of patients experienced at least one adverse drug reaction (ADR) with probable or definite causality during their stay in the hospital; 37.1 % of patients exhibited ADRs that had some therapeutic impact on further treatment. ADRs that led to drug discontinuation were observed in 8.6 %. This rate ranged from 9.5 to 5.1 % for haloperidol and perazine, the most common neuroleptics at that time; sedating antidepressants (AD) rated lower than non-sedating (amitriptyline 5.1 %, clomipramine 10.4 %). Lithium salts, antiparkinson drugs, and benzodiazepines were associated with considerably lower rates of ADRs than neuroleptics or antidepressants. Severe ADRs occurred in 1.4 % of exposed patients (e. g., toxic delirium, grand mal seizures, malignant neuroleptic syndrome, or agranulocytosis). The AMUP data suggest that administration of psychotropic drugs in psychiatric hospitals at that time was a safe, but also inconvenient treatment for many patients due to a wide range of bothersome side effects that compromised patient compliance. The data can serve as a reference base for comparisons with newer compounds introduced to the market over the last decade such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new AD, atypical neuroleptics, or other new generation psychotropic drugs.", 
    "41": "M100240, an acetate thioester of MDL 100,173, is a dual angiotensin-converting enzyme/neutral endopeptidase inhibitor currently in Phase II development. M100240 and MDL 100,173 were evaluated in an in vitro cytochrome P450 human hepatocyte model for enzyme induction. Although a dose-dependent CYP3A induction was observed between 10 and 100 microM, at 1 microM-which approaches clinically relevant plasma concentrations in humans-there was no evidence of CYP3A induction. An in vitro reporter gene assay also demonstrated the CYP3A isozyme induction potential of M100240 and MDL 100,173 with an EC(50) approximately 1.5 microM. The present study evaluated the potential for CYP3A enzyme induction in healthy volunteers. In an open-label, single-sequence, replicate-design study using midazolam as a CYP3A probe in 13 healthy volunteers, we found no evidence of clinically relevant CYP3A induction after multiple-dose administration of 50 mg M100240 orally once daily for 15 days. Single and multiple doses of M100240 increased the midazolam AUC(0-24 h) about 1.6-fold compared to baseline, suggesting weak CYP3A inhibition. Concomitant administration of midazolam and M100240 was generally safe and well tolerated. Although in vitro CYP3A induction at exposures in excess of clinically relevant human plasma concentrations has been demonstrated, there is no clinical evidence of CYP3A induction with M100240 administration at proposed therapeutic doses.", 
    "42": "As a continuation of our search for new ligands acting on benzodiazepine receptors among the fused 2-thiohydantoin derivatives, a series of 5-substituted imidazo[2,1-b]thiazepines was synthesized and investigated in radioligand binding studies at the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors in rat brain cortical membranes. Among ortho-substituted 5-arylidene-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazepines compounds could be identified which exhibit affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site at low micromolar concentrations. X-ray structure analyses for two compounds (6ae and 6ag) have been performed. In order to analyze the structure-activity relationships, 3D models of all compounds have been completed (using X-ray data). Physicochemical properties calculated (log P and log D) as well as experimental thin layer chromatography data were examined.", 
    "43": "Although ethanol has been reported to inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus synapses of rats, very little is known about the effect of ethanol on synaptic plasticity in other brain regions. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of ethanol on long-term potentiation in synaptic pathway from the basolateral amygdala to the dentate gyrus by using anesthetized rats in vivo. I.v. (20-40% x 2 ml/kg) or i.c.v. (30-40% x 5 microl) administration of ethanol did not affect the basal amplitude of dentate gyrus field potential evoked by basolateral amygdala stimulation, but significantly inhibited the induction of long-term potentiation following application of tetanic stimulation. Since long-term potentiation in this pathway was independent of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, the inhibitory effect of ethanol is unlikely to be caused by suppression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor function. Alternatively, long-term potentiation in this pathway was significantly suppressed by the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.), and the inhibitory effect of ethanol was abolished by the GABAA receptor channel blocker picrotoxin (1 mg/kg, i.p.). The present study demonstrates that ethanol inhibits the induction of long-term potentiation in the basolateral amygdala-dentate gyrus pathway by enhancing GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission.", 
    "44": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common (lifetime prevalence: 5.1%), recurrent condition, which often heralds other psychiatric disorders, notably depression. As by definition it is a disorder progressing over months, treatment should be designed on a long term basis. And yet, few studies have been conducted beyond the classical 6-8 weeks characterizing the acute treatment phase. This is especially true of anxiolytics, but also of antidepressants, with the exception of paroxetine and venlafaxine, which are the only drugs approved in this indication in Western countries. The efficacy of psychotherapy, notably relaxation and cognitive-behavioral therapy, is established in the treatment of GAD, but its preferred indications and possible combination with antidepressants are still to be specified. Long term, not to say very long term studies of GAD, as well as depression, will still be required in the future to improve its management and specify therapeutic modalities (combination treatment, optimal duration, continuous or intermittent therapy, choice of psychotherapeutic techniques or agents, em leader ). Early and adequately prolonged treatment should not only result in more numerous remission periods, but also in decreased frequency of co-morbidities whether depressive, addictive, or of another nature, and should also reduce the social impact of GAD.", 
    "45": "As an extension of our previous work, where the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) increased in mantle mitochondria of the marine mollusk Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. under chronic exposure to lead, the present study investigates the in vitro effects of an exogenous source of lead ions on PBR and on adenylyl cyclase (AC) complex in mantle membranes of mussels collected from a non-polluted coastal area. PBR binding experiments used the specific isoquinoline carboxamide derivative [3H]PK 11195, and AC activity was measured using a modified procedure adapted to M. galloprovincialis. Lead ions (Pb2+) dose-dependently decreased either the [3H]PK 11195 specific binding in mitochondria or basal AC velocity in plasma membranes of mussel mantle. The IC50 values for lead ions were 10 microM with [3H]PK 11195 binding and 25 microM with AC activity, with maximal inhibition values of 60% and 70%, respectively. Moreover, lead behaved as a non-competitive inhibitor on [3H]PK 11195 binding and as a 'mixed' inhibitor on AC activity. The present results suggest that some of the early effects induced by lead in mussel cell metabolism consist in significant changes of the PBR density and cyclic AMP production in the mantle of M. galloprovincialis.", 
    "46": "GABA regulates proliferation via GABAA receptors during development of the neocortex. We recently demonstrated that the endogenous GABAA receptor modulator allopregnanolone plays a role in regulating normal neurodevelopment in prefrontal cortex. Benzodiazepine exposure during early development produces marked behavioral changes in adult rats. To determine if exposure to benzodiazepines during development alters GABAergic interneurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC), rat pups were exposed to flunitrazepam (2.5 mg/kg) on postnatal day (P) 2 and assayed for parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactivity on P80. The ratio of parvalbumin labeled cells in deep vs. superficial layers increased five-fold; calbindin-immunoreactivity and total cell number were not altered. These data are consistent with altered distribution of a subset of interneurons after benzodiazepine exposure and suggest a role for GABAA receptor modulation in normal development of GABAergic systems in PFC.", 
    "47": "The aim of this study was to replicate and extend the findings of O'Connor, B\u00e9langer, Marchand, Dupuis, Elie, and Boyer [Addict. Behav. 24 (1999) 537], which had established a psychosocial profile associated with psychological distress in benzodiazepine (BZD) use. Forty-one participants with anxiety or insomnia, receiving maintenance therapy of BZD for at least 8 weeks, participated in a 20-week, tapered discontinuation protocol with physician counselling. Drug type and use was monitored throughout. Questionnaire measures of anxiety, behavioural inhibition, neuroticism, withdrawal complaints, social support, psychological distress, self-efficacy in coping without BZD, quality of life, positive and negative life events, were completed at baseline, postdiscontinuation, and at 3-month follow-up. Measures of baseline psychological distress and anxiety inhibition were consistently associated with both discontinuation and the emergence of withdrawal complaints. Successful withdrawal was characterized by low baseline neuroticism, low behavioural inhibition, higher number of positive events, and higher level of social support satisfaction. Higher dosage (in diazepam equivalent dose) was associated with both poorer outcome and the emergence of withdrawal symptoms. Self-efficacy in coping was negatively associated with relapse but not with outcome. Psychosocial factors play a role at different stages of the BZD withdrawal process and could be targeted in treatment.", 
    "48": "Although mice are amenable to gene knockout, they have not been exploited in the setting of seizure-induced neurodegeneration due to the resistance to injury of key mouse strains. We refined and developed models of seizure-induced neuronal death in the C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains by focally evoking seizures using intra-amygdala kainic acid. Seizures in adult male BALB/c mice, or C57BL/6 mice as reference, caused ipsilateral death of CA1 and CA3 neurons within the hippocampus. Termination of seizures by lorazepam was more effective than diazepam in both strains, largely restricting neuronal loss to the CA3 sector. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings defined injurious and non-injurious seizure patterns, which could not be separated adequately by behavioral observation alone. Degenerating neurons in the hippocampus were positive for DNA fragmentation and approximately a third of these exhibited morphologic features of programmed cell death. Western blot analysis revealed the cleavage of caspase-8 after seizures in both strains. These data refine our C57BL/6 model and establish a companion model of focally evoked limbic seizures in the BALB/c mouse that provides further evidence for activation of programmed cell death after seizures.",

Very little is known about the plasma concentration in patients at various oral doses of olanzapine or about the clinically relevant interactions with co-medications.", 
    "50": "In 71 schizophrenic patients (age 32.6 +/- 12.1, range 18-63 years; 31 women, 40 men), plasma olanzapine levels were assessed in 377 tests by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Fifty-six of these plasma levels were assessed while patients were receiving olanzapine as monotherapy; otherwise, the plasma levels were assessed with the patients receiving various co-medications.", 
    "51": "The mean daily oral dose of olanzapine was 17.5 mg (SD = 7.0, range 5-40 mg), and the mean olanzapine plasma concentration was 54.2 ng/ml (SD 37.8 ng/ml, range 1.2-208 ng/ml). The plasma concentration of olanzapine increased linearly with the daily oral dose (r = 0.64, p < 0.001). A multiple variance analysis considering age and sex as covariables showed a significant difference in the dose-corrected plasma levels of olanzapine among 40 smokers and 31 non-smokers; age and sex did not affect the dose-corrected plasma levels. However, women received a significantly lower daily dose of olanzapine under routine clinical study conditions. No differences could be detected among the dose-corrected plasma concentration of those patients who were taken off olanzapine because they did not respond (n = 14) or because of side effects (n = 5) and those who were discharged while still on olanzapine. Under the co-medication with fluvoxamine, significantly higher dose-corrected olanzapine plasma concentrations were found than with olanzapine monotherapy, whereas significantly lower dose-corrected olanzapine plasma concentrations were detected under lithium and trimipramine co-medication. Under co-medication with amitriptyline, benperidol, carbamazepine, flupentixol, and lorazepam, the dose-corrected olanzapine plasma concentrations were no different than the plasma levels under olanzapine monotherapy.",

    "53": "Hypersalivation is known as a frequent, disturbing, and socially stigmatizing side effect of therapy with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. It has been shown that the addition of the anticholinergic pirenzepine is able to reduce clozapine-induced hypersalivation, probably by blocking M4-receptors. Nevertheless, a pharmacokinetic interaction between both compounds cannot be excluded.", 
    "54": "In this pilot study, 29 schizophrenic patients (ICD-10; 51.7 % female; age: 36.7 +/- 8.7 years [mean +/- SD]) were included. Serum concentrations of clozapine and its pharmacologically active metabolite N-desmethylclozapine were determined under steady-state conditions by automated HPLC with UV detection before and after addition of pirenzepine for 3 days.", 
    "55": "Significantly fewer patients reported hypersalivation after addition of pirenzepine (69 % vs. 34.5 %, P = 0.002). No significant differences of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine serum levels before (329 +/- 181 ng/ml and 218.0 +/- 123.4 ng/ml, respectively) and 3 days after (336 +/- 215 ng/ml and 235.9 +/- 164.4 ng/ml, respectively) addition of pirenzepine were found. In three patients, however, clozapine serum levels increased; this was probably unrelated to pirenzepine.",

    "57": "We studied the role of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors in the commissural subnucleus of the nucleus tractus solitarius (commNTS) in chemoreceptor reflex in urethane-anesthetized, pancronium-immobilized, artificially ventilated and bilaterally vagotomized rats. A BDZ agonist, diazepam (1-4 micromol/kg), administered intravenously reduced resting phrenic nerve activity (PNA) and blood pressure (BP). Stimulation of carotid chemoreceptors induced an increase in PNA and an increase in BP. Diazepam inhibited this chemoreceptor reflex. The effects of intravenous injection of diazepam (4 micromol/kg) on the chemoreceptor reflex were antagonized by microinjection of the BDZ antagonist flumazenil (100 pmol) into the commNTS. Microinjection of flumazenil (100 pmol) alone had no effect on the basal PNA and BP, and the chemoreceptor reflex. These results suggest that BDZ receptors are present in the carotid chemoreceptor reflex pathway in the commNTS and potentiate GABA(A) transmission.", 
    "58": "We previously showed that maternal exposure to nicotine, alone or in combination with chlorpyrifos, caused an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining in the CA1 subfield of hippocampus and cerebellum in postnatal day (PND) 30 offspring. In the present study, PND 60 offspring were evaluated for histopathological and cholinergic effects following maternal exposure to nicotine and chlorpyrifos, alone and in combination. Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) were treated daily with nicotine (1 mg/kg, s.c., in normal saline) or chlorpyrifos (0.1 mg/kg, dermal, in ethanol) or a combination of nicotine and chlorpyrifos from gestational days (GD) 4 to 20. Control animals were treated with saline and ethanol. On PND 60, the offspring were evaluated for cholinergic changes and pathological effects. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in the female offspring from chlorpyrifos treated mothers showed a significant increase (approximately 183% of control). Male offspring from mothers treated with either chlorpyrifos or nicotine alone showed a significant increase in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brainstem while female offspring from mothers treated with either nicotine or a combination of nicotine and chlorpyrifos showed a significant increase (approximately 134 and 126% of control, respectively) in AChE activity in the brainstem. No significant changes were observed in the ligand binding densities for alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the cortex. Histopathological evaluation using cresyl violet staining showed a significant decrease in surviving Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum of the offspring from nicotine treated mothers. An increase in GFAP immunostaining in cerebellar white matter was observed in the offspring from the mothers treated with nicotine. These results suggest that maternal exposure to real-life levels of nicotine and/or chlorpyrifos causes differential regulation of brainstem AChE activity. Also, nicotine caused a decrease in the surviving neurons and an increased expression of GFAP in cerebellar white matter of the offspring on PND 60. These changes can lead to long-term neurological adverse health effects later in life.", 
    "59": "Oxazepam is a commonly used 1,4-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug that is polymorphically metabolized in humans. However, the molecular basis for this phenomenon is currently unknown. We have previously shown that S-oxazepam glucuronide, the major oxazepam metabolite, is selectively formed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B15, whereas the minor R-oxazepam glucuronide is produced by multiple UGTs other than UGT2B15. Phenotype-genotype studies were conducted using microsomes and DNA prepared from the same set of 54 human livers. Sequencing of the UGT2B15 gene revealed three nonsynonymous polymorphisms, D85Y, T352I, and K523T, with variant allele frequencies of 0.56, 0.02, and 0.40, respectively. D85Y genotype showed a significant effect (p = 0.012) on S-oxazepam glucuronidation with lower median activities in 85Y/Y livers (49 pmol/min/mg protein) compared with 85D/D livers (131 pmol/min/mg), whereas 85D/Y livers were intermediate in activity (65 pmol/min/mg). There was also a significant trend (p = 0.049) for higher S-oxazepam activities in the two 352T/I livers (135 and 210 pmol/min/mg) compared with the remaining 352T/T livers (median, 64 pmol/min/mg). Conversely, K523T genotype had no apparent effect on oxazepam glucuronidation (p > 0.05). Donor gender also significantly influenced S-oxazepam glucuronidation with higher median activities in male (65 pmol/min/mg) compared with female (39 pmol/min/ mg) livers (p = 0.042). R-Oxazepam glucuronidation was not affected by either genotype or gender (p > 0.05). In conclusion, gender and D85Y genotype are identified as major determinants of S-oxazepam glucuronidation by human liver and may explain in part polymorphic oxazepam glucuronidation by human subjects.",

However, this combination does not necessarily result in increased frequency of serious adverse events. Thus it is not regarded as an absolute contraindication and might be useful in distinct clinical situations, e.g., during the occurrence of a malignant neuroleptic syndrome, \"catatonic dilemma,\" or severe agitation during clozapine treatment. In the following report, certain suggestions on how to deal with this combination therapy are provided which may provide a basis for discussion that ultimately may lead to the formulation of guidelines for this combination therapy. Such guidelines may help psychiatrists in dealing with this combination in clinical situations. Moreover, the formulation of such guidelines would help with forensic issues in case of serious adverse events occurring during this combination therapy.",

We found a negative correlation between PBR expression and estrogen receptor status (P = 0.03) as well as a positive correlation between PBR and Ki-67 (P = 0.044). Although the disease-free survival was not affected by PBR in the whole population, high PBR expression level was significantly correlated with a shorter disease-free survival in the lymph node-negative patients, P = 0.038.",

    "71": "In recent years we have noticed an increasing proportion of mortalities resulting from an overdose of heroin that involve routes of administration other than injection. Of 239 cases of fatal heroin intoxication examined at our department during the period 1997-2000, 18 deaths were associated with non-parental administration. Seven of these fatalities were experienced heroin users who had begun to use more sporadically, seven were recreational \"party-users\", while the remaining four persons had relapsed into heroin use following long periods of abstinence. The median blood morphine concentration of these non-injectors was 0.095 microg/g (range: 0.02-0.67 microg/g), significantly lower than that of the injectors. Concurrent use of alcohol, other illicit drugs and/or pharmaceutical preparations was observed in 17 of the 18 cases. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the victims of heroin intoxication by injection or by other routes with respect to the proportion who had simultaneously consumed alcohol or benzodiazepines. Pathological alterations like lung fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, endocarditis, etc. were not found to play a significant role in any of the 18 mortalities. We conclude that snorting or smoking heroin probably involves a reduced risk of obtaining high blood concentrations of morphine but still constitutes a considerable risk of lethal outcome due to high variability in blood concentrations. Furthermore, decreased tolerance resulting from periods of reduced or sporadic use appears to be an important risk factor in connection with heroin overdosing by snorting or smoking, which indicate that some heroin addicts may inaccurately assume that these routes of administration are safe when resuming their use of heroin after a period of abstinence.",

In consideration of the previous reports of insomnia and apparent widespread use of benzodiazepines and other hypnotics in hospitalized patients, we conducted a study to assess quality of sleep and hypnotic drug use in our acute care adult patient population.

A validated Verran and Snyder-Halpern (VSH) Sleep Scale measuring sleep disturbance, sleep effectiveness, and sleep supplementation was completed daily by patients and scores were compared to population statistics. Patients were also asked to identify factors influencing sleep while in hospital, and sedating drug use prior to and during hospitalization was also assessed.", 
    "74": "During the 70-day study period, 100 patients completed at least one sleep questionnaire. There was a relatively even distribution of males versus females, most patients were in their 8th decade of life, retired, and suffered from multiple chronic diseases. The median self-reported pre-admission sleep duration for participants was 8 hours and our review of PharmaNet profiles revealed that 35 (35%) patients had received a dispensed prescription for a hypnotic or antidepressant drug in the 3-month period prior to admission. Benzodiazepines were the most common sedating drugs prescribed. Over 300 sleep disturbance, effective and supplementation scores were completed. Sleep disturbance scores across all study days ranged 16-681, sleep effectiveness scores ranged 54-402, while sleep supplementation scores ranged between 0-358. Patients tended to have worse sleep scores as compared to healthy non-hospitalized US adults in all three scales. When compared to US non-hospitalized adults with insomnia, our patients demonstrated sleep disturbance and supplementation scores that were similar on Day 1, but lower (i.e. improved) on Day 3, while sleep effectiveness were higher (i.e. better) on both days. There was an association between sleep disturbance scores and the number of chronic diseases, the presence of pain, the use of bedtime tricyclic antidepressants, and the number of chronic diseases without pain. There was also an association between sleep effectiveness scores and the length of hospitalization, the in hospital use of bedtime sedatives and the presence of pain. Finally, an association was identified between sleep supplementation scores and the in hospital use of bedtime sedatives (tricyclic antidepressants and loxapine), and age. Twenty-nine (29%) patients received a prescription for a hypnotic drug while in hospital, with no evidence of pre-admission hypnotic use. The majority of these patients were prescribed zopiclone, lorazepam or another benzodiazepine.",

The primary endpoint was posttraumatic seizures within 48 hours; secondary endpoints were survival and neurologic outcome 30 days after injury. A Bayesian decision-theoretic clinical trial design was used to determine the probability of remaining posttraumatic seizure free for each treatment group.", 
    "79": "One hundred two patients were enrolled, with a median age of 6.1 years. Sixty-eight percent were boys. The 2 treatment groups were well matched. During the 48-hour observation period, 3 (7%) of 46 patients given phenytoin and 3 (5%) of 56 patients given placebo experienced a posttraumatic seizure. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in survival or neurologic outcome after 30 days. According to these results, the probability that phenytoin has the originally hypothesized effect of reducing the rate of early posttraumatic seizures by 12.5% is 0.0053. The probability that phenytoin has any prophylactic efficacy is 0.383. The median effect size in this trial was -0.015 (seizure rate increased by 1.5% in the phenytoin group), 95% probability interval -0.127 to 0.091 (12.7% higher rate of posttraumatic seizures to a 9.1% lower rate of posttraumatic seizures with phenytoin).",

In addition, the effects of a CCK(1) antagonist (CR1409) were investigated for its possible mediation in anxiety behavior between PVG hooded and SD rats. PVG hooded rats treated with CCK-4, decreased the time spent in the open arm and increased the time spent in the closed arm and correspondingly showed increase in the number of entries in the open arms while the number of entries in closed arm was insignificant, whereas SD rats decreased the time spent in the closed arm, while other parameters remained insignificant. PVG hooded rats administered with various CCK(2) antagonists (LY225910, LY288513, and CR2945) significantly increased the time spent in the open arm and correspondingly decreased the time spent in the closed arm, while the number of entries in the open or closed arm was insignificant, in contrast, SD rats failed to show any reliable significance. PVG hooded rats administered with the CCK(1) antagonist (CR1409), failed to show any reliable significance, in contrast, SD rats significantly increased the time spent in the open arm. The strain differences observed in this study suggests that CCK plays mainly as a neuromodulator, in which the various CCK(2) antagonists may not affect baseline anxiety state, but instead they modulate heightened states of anxiety through differential effects of CCK(1)/CCK(2) receptors.",

Of these, there were 6054 Medicaid enrollees in New York and 6875 enrollees in New Jersey who were clinically vulnerable patients with >/=1 of the specified diagnoses. New York Medicaid patients with any of these diagnoses experienced a -48.1% relative change (95% CI, -50.0% to -46.2%) in benzodiazepine use at 6 months after TPP implementation, with no decline in use in New Jersey patients. The largest reduction in benzodiazepine use was seen among patients with seizure disorder (-59.9% at 6 months; 95% CI, -63.9% to -55.9%). Although use of substitute drugs increased slightly in New York after the TPP, it did not offset reductions in benzodiazepine use. The effects of TPP were sustained for 7 years of follow-up and had the greatest impact on nonproblematic benzodiazepine use.",

    "87": "A bioartificial liver (BAL) based on viable porcine hepatocytes can serve as a bridge to liver transplantation in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). To support liver functions, an adequate mass of hepatocytes is needed, which depends upon the cell density in the BAL device. This study evaluated the optimal density of hepatocytes within BAL devices that were constructed by perfusing porcine hepatocyte suspensions mixed with cytodex-3 into polysulfon hollow-fibers. The BAL devices were prepared with 6 different cell densities. The mass of hepatocytes in each device was evaluated for (a) cell viability, (b) ability to degrade diazepam, (c) ability to synthesize urea, (d) incorporation of [3H]-leucine into protein, (e) glucose-6-phosphatase activity, (f) total RNA content, and (g) p53 gene expression. Hepatocyte viability was about 90% in each device. With increasing hepatocyte density, the diazepam concentration in the medium decreased from 9.26 +/- 0.96 mg/L at 1 x 10(5) cells/ml to a minimum of 5.25 +/- 1.02 mg/L at 5 x 10(6) cells/ml and thereafter remained at low levels. Urea production and [3H]-leucine incorporation into protein increased progressively until the cell density reached 5 x 10(6)/ml and thereafter remained at high levels. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity and total RNA content stayed at high levels until the cell density reached 5 x 10(6)/ml and then progressively decreased. p53 gene expression differed from the other parameters, since it increased only when the cell density reached 5 x 10(7)/ml. In conclusion, the density of 5 x 10(6) cells/ml is a critical inflection point for most of the functional parameters, although p53 gene expression is not elevated at this cell density. These findings suggest that 5 x 10(6) cells/ml is the optimal hepatocyte density in the hollow-fiber BAL device.",

Guinea pigs, implanted with cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) recording electrodes, were pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (0.026 mg/kg, intramuscular (i.m.)) 30 min before challenge with 56 micrograms/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.), (2 x LD50) of the nerve agent soman. One min after soman, the animals were treated (i.m.) with 2 mg/kg atropine sulfate admixed with 25 mg/kg of the oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride, and the EEG was observed for seizure onset. When administered (intraperitoneal, i.p.) therapeutically 5 min after seizure onset, only the highest fosphenytoin dose (180 mg/kg) was capable of terminating seizure activity in 50% of the animals tested (3 of 6). When fosphenytoin (18-180 mg/kg) was administered as a pretreatment, i.p., 30 min before soman challenge, seizures were blocked or terminated in a dose-dependent fashion (ED50 = 61.8 mg/kg; 40.5-94.7 mg/kg = 95% confidence limits). Combinations of diazepam and fosphenytoin were also tested for effectiveness. No dose of fosphenytoin (18-56 mg/kg), given in conjunction with a fixed dose of diazepam (4.8 mg/kg, i.m.) 5 min after seizure onset, enhanced the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam. When fosphenytoin (18 or 32 mg/kg, i.p.) was given as a pretreatment and diazepam was given 5 min after seizure onset, the 32 mg/kg dose of fosphenytoin significantly reduced the time for seizure control. These studies show that fosphenytoin, either alone or in combination with diazepam, has little or no therapeutic anticonvulsant effectiveness for nerve agent-induced status epilepticus.", 
    "93": "The encephalographic (EEG) properties of zaleplon were investigated in comparison with those of other sedative hypnotics in conscious rats with chronically implanted electrodes. The oral administration of zaleplon (0.25-1.0 mg/kg), triazolam (0.0625-0.25 mg/kg), zopiclone (1.0-4.0 mg/kg), brotizolam (0.0625-0.25 mg/kg), and nitrazepam (0.125-0.5 mg/kg) lengthened the total sleep in a dose-dependent manner. On distribution of sleep-wakefulness stages, zaleplon, in particular, increased the slow wave deep sleep (SWDS), whereas triazolam, brotizolam, and nitrazepam increased the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner. Zopiclone significantly increased the SWDS at a dose of 2 mg/kg and both the SWLS and the SWDS at a dose of 4 mg/kg. All tested hypnotics caused no influence on fast wave sleep (FWS) at doses tested. The appearance of the sleep-inducing activity of zaleplon was more rapid than those of any compounds tested, and zaleplon significantly increased the relative EEG power density in the delta frequency band over that of triazolam at 20 and 30 min after the administration in the spectral analysis. Therefore, the present findings suggest that the non-benzodiazepine zaleplon can be expected to exhibit high practical potential as a hypnotic and is characterized by an increase in SWDS with rapid onset of hypnotic action.",

We found that these hybrids bind to TAR-RNA and inhibit TAR/protein(s) interactions. The anti-proliferative activity of the hybrids has been tested in vitro on HL3T1 cells and compared to the anti-proliferative effects of the natural product distamycin A and PBD. The effects on HIV-1 LTR directed transcription were studied using the chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase gene reporter system, and structure-activity relationships are discussed. The results obtained demonstrate that the hybrids 22-25 exhibit different TAR-RNA binding activity with respect to both distamycin A and PBD. In addition, a direct relationship was found between number of pyrrole rings present in the hybrids 22-25 and anti-proliferative effects. It was found that increased length of the polypyrrole backbone leads to an increased in vitro anti-proliferative effect, i.e. the hybrid 25, containing the four pyrroles distamycin analogous, is more active than 22, 23 and 24 against cell proliferation. With respect to inhibition of HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription, it was found that the hybrids 23-25 containing two-four pyrroles are active. Therefore, when anti-proliferative effects are considered together with the inhibitory effects of HIV-1 LTR driven transcription, our results suggest that the hybrid 23 is the more interesting, since it exhibits low anti-proliferative activity and inhibits HIV-1 LTR driven transcription both in vitro and in ex vivo experiments.", 
    "95": "Such organophosphorus (OP) compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), sarin and soman are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) and butyrylcholinesterases (BChEs). The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP (2.0 mg/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats. The rats received AChE reactivator pralidoxime-2-chloride (2PAM) (30.0 mg/kg BW), anticonvulsant diazepam (2.0 mg/kg BW), A(1)-adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) (2.0 mg/kg BW), NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (+-MK801 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg BW) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate (50.0 mg/kg BW) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP. The control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection. The rats treated with DFP-atropine showed severe typical OP-induced toxicity signs. When CPA, diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning. Atropine-MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity. In conclusion, CPA, diazepam and 2PAM in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of DFP in rat.",

In the hypothermia group, elimination rate constant (k(e)) and clearance (CL) in the phase below 35 degrees C BT were much lesser than those above 35 degrees C BT, whereas distribution volume (V(d)) during the hypothermic phase was greater than that during the period above 35 degrees C BT.",

    "102": "The 65-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65) is considered to play an important role for GABA synthesis in the central nervous system. Using mice with targeted ablation of the GAD65 gene (GAD65(-/-) mice) we investigated a possible involvement of GABAergic neurotransmission in several taste functions. Preference/aversion responses to four basic tastes were not different between GAD65(-/-) and wild-type mice during a 48-h two-bottle choice test. GAD65(-/-) mice consumed less sucrose-quinine mixtures than did wild-type mice. The injection of midazolam (5 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine agonist, significantly increased the consumption of 100 mM sucrose in the wild-type mice. The same injection, however, failed to increase intake of the 100 mM sucrose in GAD65(-/-) mice. These results suggest that GAD65-generated GABA is not implicated in basic taste functions such as simple detection and discrimination. Rather, more complex processing of taste information including taste mixtures and palatability may be finely tuned by GAD65-mediated GABA synthesis.",

This study examines the effects of acute antipsychotic treatment using typical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine) agents on cAMP signaling in dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex in mice. PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-c) and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) levels were measured to evaluate antipsychotic drug effects. Nuclear PKA-c levels increased in the dorsal striatum after haloperidol and olanzapine treatment. In medial prefrontal cortex, olanzapine produced dose-dependent decreases in PKA-c and pCREB levels. The differential effects of typical versus atypical antipsychotic agents on PKA and pCREB in striatal and cortical regions illustrate the diverging actions of these agents on cAMP pathways.",

Fluorimetric methods have proved selective with low detection limits, whereas photometric methods showed relatively high detection limits. Successive applications of developed methods for drugs determination in pharmaceutical preparations and urine samples were performed.

    "105": "Aim: The aim of the present investigation was to test study benzodiazepines (BZDs) profile in patients with viral cirrhosis under different combinations of rifaximine and of a novel symbiotic. Methods: Our study groups consisted of 30 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCV-related Child B liver cirrhosis. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups: rifaximine 400mg t.i.d. for 2 weeks; (B) SCM-III (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacteria in a ion- and vitamin-enriched medium, Named srl, Italy) 10ml t.i.d. for 2 weeks; (C) rifaximine 400mg t.i.d. for 1 week followed by SCM-III 10ml t.i.d. for 5 weeks. At weekly interval, blood samples were withdrawn to test BZD-like substances, ammonia and endotoxin. Results: Rifaximine treatment brought about a significant early drop of BZDs ( [Formula: see text] versus pre-treatment and versus control) till fourth week of observation when a gradual increase took place with return to pre-treatment values at the sixth week. Symbiotic treatment was comparably effective while given to patients but significantly elevated BZDs level were noted starting from the third week. Similar phenomena were noted for endotoxin and ammonia although symbiotic seemed more effective against endotoxin and rifaximine against ammonia increase. However, the sequential treatment rifaximine-symbiotic brought about a sustained normalization of BZDs, ammonia and endotoxin throughout the 6-week study. Conclusion: The present pilot study suggests that a rifaximine-symbiotic regimen could be an effective tool in compensated liver cirrhosis to limit some triggering factors of hepatic encephalopathy while being amenable to long-term use and devoid of significant side effects.",

    "110": "In the lithium-pilocarpine model (Li-pilocarpine) of temporal lobe epilepsy, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABA(A) IPSCs) were recorded in dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs) from adult rat hippocampal slices. The properties of GABA(A) IPSCs were compared before and after superfusion of modulators in control conditions (Li-saline rats) and in Li-pilocarpine rats 24-48 h and 3-5 months (epileptic rats) after status epilepticus (SE). The mean peak amplitude of GABA(A) IPSCs increased by about 40% over Li-saline values in GCs 24-48 h after SE and remained higher in epileptic rats. In Li-pilocarpine rats, studied at 24-48 h after SE, diazepam (1 microm) lost 65% of its effectiveness at increasing the half-decay time (T(50%)) of GABA(A) miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Diazepam had no effects on mIPSC T(50%) in epileptic rats. The benzodiazepine ligand flumazenil (1 microm), acting as an antagonist in Li-saline rats, exhibited a potent inverse agonistic effect on GABA(A) mIPSCs of GCs from Li-pilocarpine rats 24-48 h and 3-5 months after SE. The neurosteroid allopregnanolone (100 nm), which considerably prolonged GABA(A) mIPSCs in Li-saline rats, totally lost its effect in rats studied 24-48 h after SE. However, this decrease in effectiveness was transient and was totally restored in epileptic rats. In addition to the up-regulation in the number of receptors at individual GC synapses, we propose that these 'epileptic' GABA(A) receptors possess benzodiazepine binding sites with altered allosteric properties. The failure of benzodiazepine and neurosteroid to potentiate inhibition early after SE may be a critical factor in the development of epileptogenesis and occurrence of seizures.", 
    "111": "In this study, we measured the lymphocyte levels of proteins involved in apoptosis regulation, such as Bcl-2, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), caspase-3, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), either untreated or under therapy with dopaminergic agents (l-Dopa alone or l-dopa + dopamine agonists) and in healthy volunteers. All PD groups showed increased activity of caspase-3, compared to controls, particularly those under treatment only with l-Dopa. In this latter group, the increase in caspase-3 activity was also paralleled by an increase in the concentration of Cu/Zn SOD. In addition, patients taking l-Dopa + dopamine agonists showed marked decrease in Bcl-2 levels and increased PBR expression, which seems in keeping with the hypothesis that PBR may be functionally related to Bcl-2. In conclusion, we found clear modifications in the levels of proteins involved in the control of apoptosis in lymphocytes of PD patients. These changes were disease related but also modulated by the pharmacological treatment, which confirms the potential role of apoptosis in PD pathogenesis and the modulatory influence of dopaminergic agents.", 
    "112": "The permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), a mitochondrial polyprotein complex, has been previously described to be involved in the control of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. PTPC may contain proteins from both mitochondrial membranes [e.g., voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), PRAX-1, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT)], from cytosol (e.g., hexokinase II, glycerol kinase), from matrix [e.g., cyclophilin D (CypD)], and from intermembrane space (e.g., creatine kinase). PTPC may also interact with tumor suppressor proteins (i.e., Bax and Bid), oncoprotein homologues of Bcl-2 and some viral proteins, which can regulate apoptosis induced by pore opening. ANT and VDAC are the target of numerous pro-apoptotic MMP inducers. However, the precise composition of PTPC as well as the respective role of each PTPC component represent major issues in the understanding MMP process. Using several experimental strategies that combine co-immunoprecipitation, proteomics, and functional tests with proteoliposomes, we and others have been able to characterize some of the intra/inter-PTPC protein interactions leading to a better understanding of the process of MMP. In addition, this approach could identify new putative members and regulators of PTPC pro-apoptotic function and new targets of viral protein involved in the modulation of apoptosis during infection.", 
    "113": "GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. When GABA binds to the ubiquitous GABA-A receptors on neurons, chloride channels are activated leading to a rapid increase in chloride conductance that depresses excitatory depolarization. The GABA-A receptors are targets for many clinically important drugs, such as the benzodiazepines, general anaesthetics, and barbiturates. All of these drugs enhance the chloride current activated by GABA. Of the GABA-A receptor family, the subtype 2 is critical for the treatment of anxiety spectrum disorders. To avoid unwanted side effects, it is necessary to find highly selective drugs that interact only with subtype 2 but not with the related receptors such as subtypes 1, 3, and 5. To realize such a goal, it is important to have not only the 3D (dimensional) structure of subtype 2 but also the 3D structures of subtypes 1, 3, and 5. In this study, the 3D structures of all the four subtypes of GABA-A receptors have been derived. The computer-modeled heteropentameric structures bear the following features: (1) each of the five subunits in the pentamer has an intrachain disulfide bond, a hallmark of ligand-gated pentameric channels; (2) those residues which are sensitive to the binding of the benzodiazepine site ligands are grouped around the alpha1,2,3,5/gamma2 interfaces; and (3) those residues which are sensitive to the binding of GABA molecules are grouped around the alpha1,2,3,5/beta2 interfaces. All these findings are fully consistent with experimental observations. Meanwhile, for those sensitive or key residues, a close look at their subtle difference among the four subtypes has been provided through a highlighted superposition picture. In addition to providing the atomic coordinates, the predicted structures have further clarified some ambiguities that could not been uniquely determined by the existing experimental data, such as the directionality of the subunit arrangement in the heteropentamers. The 3D models may provide a reasonable structural frame or footing for designing highly selective drugs. The present models might be also useful in understanding the basic mechanism of operation of the GABA-A receptors, stimulating novel strategies for developing more specific drugs and better treatments.", 
    "114": "Midazolam is widely used as a sedative and anesthetic induction agent. The aim of this study was to systematically examine the inhibitory mechanisms of midazolam in platelet aggregation. In this study, midazolam concentration-dependently (15 and 30 microM) inhibited platelet aggregation in washed human platelets stimulated by thrombin (0.05 U/ml). Midazolam (15 and 30 microM) also inhibited phosphoinositide breakdown and intracellular Ca(+2) mobilization in platelets stimulated by thrombin (0.05 U/ml). In addition, midazolam (15 and 30 microM) increased the formation of cyclic AMP but not cyclic GMP or nitric oxide. The thrombin-evoked increase in pHi was markedly inhibited in the presence of midazolam (15 and 30 microM). Rapid phosphorylation of a platelet protein of molecular weight (Mr.) 47,000 (P47), a marker of protein kinase C activation, was triggered by thrombin (0.05 U/ml). This phosphorylation was markedly inhibited by midazolam (15 and 30 microM). Midazolam (30 microM) did not significantly reduce the electron spin resonance signal intensity of hydroxyl radicals in activated platelets. In the vivo study, intravenous injection of midazolam (10 microg/g) significantly prolonged the latent period of inducing platelet plug formation in mesenteric venules. These results indicate that midazolam can significantly prevent thrombus formation in vivo. Its antiplatelet activity may be involved in the inhibition of the activation of phospholipase C and the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger and increased cyclic AMP formation. These lead to lower intracellular Ca(+2) mobilization and phosphorylation of P47.", 
    "115": "Previous studies have shown that repeated injections of acidic saline, given into the lateral gastrocnemius muscle of rats, results in a bilateral reduction in withdrawal threshold to tactile stimulation of the hindpaws. We have now characterised this model of muscoskeletal pain pharmacologically, by evaluating the antinociceptive effects of various analgesics after systemic administration. The micro-opioid receptor agonist morphine (3 and 6 mg/kg) produced a particularly prolonged antiallodynic effect. The glutamate receptor antagonists ([8-methyl-5-(4-(N,N-dimethylsulfamoyl)phenyl)-6,7,8,9,-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-h]-iso-quinoline-2,3-dione-3-O-(4-hydroxybutyric acid-2-yl)oxime] NS1209 and ketamine (6 and 15 mg/kg, respectively), the KCNQ K(+) channel openers retigabine and flupirtine (10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively) and the Na(+) channel blocker mexiletine (37.5 mg/kg) also significantly increased paw withdrawal threshold, although to a lesser degree than morphine. In contrast, the anticonvulsant lamotrigine (30 mg/kg), the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor carprofen (15 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (3 mg/kg) were ineffective. All antinociceptive effects were observed at nonataxic doses as determined by the rotarod test. These results suggest that in this model, muscle-mediated pain can be alleviated by various analgesics with differing mechanisms of action, and that once established ongoing inflammation does not appear to contribute to this process.", 
    "116": "Chronic prenatal ethanol exposure (CPEE) can injure the developing brain, and may lead to the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Previous studies have demonstrated that CPEE upregulates gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor expression in the cerebral cortex, and decreases functional synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, in the adult guinea pig. This study tested the hypothesis that CPEE increases GABA(A) receptor expression in the hippocampus of guinea pig offspring that exhibit cognitive deficits in a hippocampal-dependent spatial learning task. Timed, pregnant guinea pigs were treated with ethanol (4 g/kg maternal body weight per day), isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding, or water throughout gestation. GABA(A) receptor subunit protein expression in the hippocampus was measured at two development ages: near-term fetus and young adult. In young adult guinea pig offspring, CPEE increased spontaneous locomotor activity in the open-field and impaired task acquisition in the Morris water maze. CPEE did not change GABA(A) receptor subunit protein expression in the near-term fetal hippocampus, but increased expression of the beta2/3-subunit of the GABA(A) receptor in the hippocampus of young adult offspring. CPEE did not change either [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding or GABA potentiation of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding, but decreased the efficacy of allopregnanolone potentiation of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding, to hippocampal GABA(A) receptors in adult offspring. Correlational analysis revealed a relationship between increased spontaneous locomotor activity and growth restriction in the hippocampus induced by CPEE. Similarly, an inverse relationship was found between performance in the water maze and the efficacy of allopregnanolone potentiation of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in the hippocampus. These data suggest that alterations in hippocampal GABA(A) receptor expression and pharmacological properties contribute to hippocampal-related behavioral and cognitive deficits associated with CPEE.", 
    "117": "Despite the widespread prescribing of benzodiazepines, uncertainty still surrounds the potential for cognitive impairment following their long-term use. Furthermore, the degree of recovery that may take place after withdrawal or the level of residual impairment, if any, that is maintained in long-term benzodiazepine users is also unclear. The current paper employed meta-analytic techniques to address two questions: (1) Does the cognitive function of long-term benzodiazepine users improve following withdrawal? (2) Are previous long-term benzodiazepine users still impaired at follow-up compared to controls or normative data? Results of the meta-analyses indicated that long-term benzodiazepine users do show recovery of function in many areas after withdrawal. However, there remains a significant impairment in most areas of cognition in comparison to controls or normative data. The findings of this study highlight the problems associated with long-term benzodiazepine therapy and suggest that previous benzodiazepine users would be likely to experience the benefit of improved cognitive functioning after withdrawal. However, the reviewed data did not support full restitution of function, at least in the first 6 months following cessation and suggest that there may be some permanent deficits or deficits that take longer than 6 months to completely recover.", 
    "118": "Patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) often complain of disturbed sleep resulting from nighttime motor disabilities such as nocturnal akinesia, tremor and rigidity, motor behaviour during REM sleep or periodic leg movements (PLM) during sleep. Sleep may also be affected by dopaminergic and anticholinergic drugs or coexisting depressive syndrome. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus (STN) effectively reduces PD motor disability. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sleep architecture modifications after STN DBS. We assessed five patients (two men and three women, mean age 63.8+/-3.3 years, with a mean history of PD of 13.8+/-4.9 years) who underwent STN DBS. The mean levodopa equivalent dosage (LED) was 1010+/-318 mg before surgery and 116+/-93 mg 3 months after surgery. Polysomnography (PSG) with audiovisual recordings was performed on two separate nights, the first assessment in the week before surgery and the second 3 months after surgery. Three months after surgery, PSG showed an increase in total sleep time, in the longest period of uninterrupted sleep, and in the percentage of stage 3-4 NREM sleep, while there was a reduction of wakefulness after sleep onset. PLM, apnea-hyopnea index and REM sleep behaviour disorder were unaffected by STN DBS. STN DBS seems to be an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease because it improves the cardinal symptoms and also seems to improve sleep architecture.",

    "132": "Falling accidents are a serious nocosomial problem, with balance disorders after the ingestion of hypnotics said to be a cause. Based on the results of animal studies, it was postulated that this problem involves the muscle relaxation that is a pharmacological effect of benzodiazepines (BZP). No reports have, to our knowledge, been made of time-course changes in human body balance after ingestion of hypnotics. Accordingly, we used quazepam (Doral), a long-acting hypnotic considered to show comparatively weak muscle relaxation, to study static balance after drug ingestion in human volunteers. Briefly, informed consent was obtained from 8 healthy adults, then a gait analytic system (Gangas) was used to test static balance after drug ingestion (Mann and Romberg tests). We also measured circulating drug concentration over time. Our results showed that balance disorders occurred after quazepam ingestion with an unstable posture particularly striking. Given the function of quazepam receptors, it is difficult to surmise that balance disorders after drug ingestion were due to the drug's muscle relaxation. We surmised that inhibition from the central nervous system in connection with nerves awakening was involved. We found a strong correlation between the manifestation of balance disorders after drug ingestion and circulating drug concentration.",

When applied at a concentration of 100 nM, soman induced epileptiform activity in the CA1 region in approximately 75% of slices. This effect was mimicked by the anticholinesterases paraoxon (1 and 3 microM), physostigmine (30 microM), and neostigmine (30 microM), thus providing indirect evidence that the epileptiform response was mediated by elevated acetylcholine levels. Soman-induced bursting was inhibited by the muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine (concentrations tested, 0.1-10 microM), telenzepine (0.03-3 microM), AF-DX116 [11-(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido 92.b-b) (1,4)-benzodiazepin-6-one] (0.3-300 microM), and biperiden (0.1-10 microM) and by the benzodiazepine anticonvulsants diazepam (3-30 microM) and midazolam (3-30 microM), but it was not inhibited by the nicotinic antagonists mecamylamine (30 microM) and methyllycaconitine (300 nM). In contrast to soman-induced epileptiform activity, bursting induced by the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (30 microM), the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (30 nM) or perfusion with low Mg(2+) buffer was insensitive to atropine (10 microM). The ability of muscarinic antagonists and benzodiazepines to inhibit soman-induced epileptiform activity is in accordance with the in vivo pharmacology of soman-induced seizures and suggests that the guinea pig hippocampal slice preparation may provide a useful tool for the evaluation of novel anticonvulsant therapies for the treatment of seizures related to OP poisoning.", 
    "135": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that, predominantly, mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CNS. These receptors are pentameric complexes that are comprised of subunits from several classes (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, ), with each class consisting of several isoforms. Chronic ethanol consumption alters GABA(A) receptor function producing cellular tolerance to GABA and ethanol, cross-tolerance to benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and sensitization to inverse agonists. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that GABA(A) receptors play an important role in ethanol dependence and functional properties of GABA(A) receptor are altered following chronic ethanol administration. However, the exact mechanisms that account for alterations in GABA(A) receptor function following chronic ethanol administration have not been resolved. The mechanisms responsible for adaptation of GABA(A) receptors to chronic ethanol exposure may involve ethanol-induced changes in cell surface expression, subcellular localization, synaptic localization, receptor phosphorylation, neurosteroids, and/or changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit composition. In this review, we provide an overview of recent data pertaining to mechanisms that could be responsible for altered properties and expression of GABA(A) receptors following chronic ethanol administration.",

We retrospectively investigated the details of antiepileptic treatment in 110 consecutive episodes in 103 patients with CwG. The temporal course of the seizures and the use of antiepileptic drugs were investigated in each episode. Drugs were judged as effective when seizure cessation was achieved after administration of the drug. As the first drug, diazepam (DZP)/bromazepam (BZP) was effective in 38%, phenobarbital (PB) in 40%, and lidocaine (LD) in 100%. As the second drug, DZP/BZP was effective in 42%, PB in 69%, and LD in 100%. As the third drug, PB was effective in 70%. When the efficacy of the first doses of PB and LD were compared, the efficacy rate was significantly higher for LD than for PB (P = 0.047). In conclusion, LD was effective for the cessation of seizures in patients with CwG.",

In order to investigate the potential to model drug-drug interactions with midazolam in the dog, a selective and sensitive high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS-MS) method has been developed, with sufficient sensitivity to allow analysis of dog plasma samples generated following administration of a clinically relevant dose. The method involves extraction of midazolam and internal standard (flunitrazepam) from dog plasma, using 96-well Oasis MCX solid phase extraction plates. The assay has been validated over a concentration range of 0.1-10 ng/ml and its specificity, accuracy and precision demonstrated. The relative bias of the assay was within +/-15% for all standards with intra- and inter-assay precision (coefficient of variation-%CV) of less than 15%. The assay was applied to the analysis of plasma samples (0.2 ml), generated following intravenous or oral administration of midazolam to male beagle dogs, at a dose level of 0.05 mg/kg, and pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from the resulting data.",

In three randomised trials, the efficacy of intranasal and oral midazolam in hospitalised patients was similar to, and even higher than, that of intravenous or rectal diazepam, with a similar speed of action and safety; no studies have been conducted, however, in the extra hospital milieu and its risk of respiratory depression may be like that of other benzodiazepines. One of the problems of using the parenteral solution for intranasal administration is the irritation that is produced by its acidic pH and the relatively large volume that has to be administered. These problems could be reduced by using aerosols containing a solution of midazolam in cyclodextrin, which accomplishes a greater concentration with a pH that is less acidic.

    "156": "Drugs of the Benzodiazepine family are among the most frequently prescribed in France. Since anxiety disorders, for which these substances are mostly indicated, affect 10% of pregnant women, it is very likely that such a treatment could expose many foetuses to BZD during the first three Months of pregnancy. We know that the teratologic effect is not necessarily based on dose rate, but that it is associated with fetal drug exposure during the first 12 weeks of gestation, when organ formation occurs. Most epidemiologists concur that the baseline incidence of congenital damage is 2-2,5% in Europe. The results from a large number of stu-dies on associations between the use of BZDs in pregnancy and congenital malformations are conflicting. An in-depth analysis of existing literature shows results that are hardly comparable, if not contradictory, due to extreme differences in methodological approaches. In a recent meta-analysis case-control studies and cohort studies were analyzed separately. Among the case-control studies significant associations were found between BZD exposure and both, major malformations and oral clefts, whereas the cohort studies showed no association between BZD and any kind of malformation. The purpose of our study is to search for a specific teratogenic effect of this class of drugs, using data collected (1976-1997) by the French Central-East (FCE) registry of congenital malformations, member of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring Systems (ICBDMS) located in Lyon, France. This registry monitor malformations among 100,000 births per Year. We analyzed 13,703 cases where information is available on whether or not the mother took a drug during her first trimester of pregnancy. Among them, 3,603 (28%) actually took a drug, and 262 (6.8%) took some sort of benzodiazepine (BDZ). BZD were divided into 9 categories, 8 being the most frequently present, plus one broad category of \"others\". Malformations were divided into ten categories: congenital anomalies of heart, cleft lip and/or cleft palate, neural tube defects, other anomalies of central nervous system, hypospadias, urinary malformations, anal atresia, other digestive anomalies, limb reduction defects, and genetic anomalies, including chromosome aberrations and monogenic conditions. Other malformations were grouped in an eleventh category. The interesting aspect of this study is that it takes into account the BZD metabolism. It is worth noting that the hepatic catabolism of benzodiazepine is a very complex one, because it leads to derived molecules which are sometimes active and/or present in the common metabolic route of major commercial drugs. Our hypothesis is that if one BZD is associated specifically to a certain type of congenital defect, we may find this BZD to be overrepresented, as compared with other BZDs, in newborns exhibiting some type of congenital defect. The analysis was run according to a case-control approach. Odd ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated by logistic regression with adjustment for maternal age and parity. When one category of defects was considered, infants having the corresponding malformation were considered as cases, while infants with other malformations were considered as controls. In a similar way infants having being exposed to a given drug were considered as exposed, while infants exposed to any other drug were considered as unexposed. The analysis then was run in 4 steps. Step 1: full sample. With 13,703 cases. We observed no increased risk for any specific malformation type associated with use of BZD. Step 2: further defining drug exposure as a specific BZD, and all others unexposed, a significant association was seen between lorazepam and anal atresia. OR=6.2 (95% CI2.4-15.7, p=0.01). Step 3: this finding was upheld and no other emerged when exposure was defined as the drug or any of its active metabolites. This step was performed because hepatic catabolism of BDZs leads to derived molecules that are sometimes active and/or present in the common metabolic route of major marketed BZDs. Step 4: similarly, the lorazepam/anal atresia finding was upheld when the analysis was restricted to the 262 malformed infants exposed to BZDs in utero. Six cases of anal atresia were found among all newborns exposed to BZD in utero, and five of them were exposed to lorazepam, representing a hypothesis to be tested in further. We are not aware of other reports of this association, and it should be regarded as preliminary until confirmed in other data sets.", 
    "157": "Adverse effects of benzodiazepines are well known since the first one was used in 1958 (chlordiazepoxide). The literature collects study-cases or rarely controlled studies concerning side effects or paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines. They mostly described drowsiness and behavioral disinhibition, including increased well-being feeling but also hostility, rage access with feeling of invulnerability, serious crimes and sometimes homicides. Delusional, manic, confusional or depressive states are also pointed out. Rate for aggressive behaviour is 0.3 to 0.7% but distinction should be done between accidental or \"idiosyncratic\" reaction and voluntary sought disinhibition, clearly more frequent. No benzodiazepine has any specificity for these adverse effects but pharmacology, doses, associated drugs (or alcohol) and psychopathology interact to produce hazardous psychic states. Pharmacology: GABA induces a decrease in serotonin compound and vigilance. Pharmacokinetic: first dose effect or over-dose effect, short half-life, lipophily, affinity, digestive absorption, active metabolites interact. Psychopathology: age, alcohol association, psychological status (high initial level of hostility, impulsivity, frustration, personality disorder and depressive status). External conditions: chronic illness, affective and professional frustrations, physical or psychic exhaustion contribute also. Some benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, diazepam, clorazepate, triazolam, alprazolam, lorazepam, for example) are more often concerned for pharmacokinetics characteristics but also prescription habits. Forensic aspects should be considered in case of homicide. Especially, reality of benzodiazepines consumption and awareness of the potential paradoxical reaction should be precisely evaluated. Special focus on voluntary induced disinhibition has to be done for forensic considerations. Relationship but also crime facilitations are sometimes consciously sought. Some benzodiazepines have already been identified for this use: flunitrazepam, clorazepate but also triazolam and temazepam in UK, alprazolam in USA. Flunitrazepam is prohibited in USA and considered as narcotics in France. A Swedish study showed that violent acts were more frequent and serious in juvenile offenders taking flunitrazepam/alcohol than other young offenders staying in the same correctional institution. They recommended classification of flunitrazepam as narcotic. A study from Belgium with drug addicts concluded in the same way and asked for an increased information of professionals and a more efficient control of the delivery. Before concluding to idiosyncratic effect, and then possibly to penal irresponsibility, the forensic approach should consider: firstly the reality of the benzodiazepines absorption and implication in committing violence (urine test, chronology, amnesia); secondly, the association of unusual behaviour and converging circumstances (pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, psychopathology, external conditions); thirdly the consumer's knowledge of the disinhibition effect. In our prison practice, we have to be particularly cautious as population frequently associates personality disorder, drug addiction and high level of frustration related to penitential context. Special information should be given to inmates when benzodiazepines are prescribed, but more extensively, a preventive strategy should be adopted in general population.", 
    "158": "When treating patients with manic states, the physician has to deal with at least two main Issues. First, the therapeutic decision has to be rapid because of the unpredictability of its immediate course. This concerns often results in polypharmacy with adjunct treatments. However, the therapeutic choice has to be cautious since part of the treatment will be maintained for prophylaxis. According to recent guidelines, the use of monotherapy with mood stabilisers during acute manic states concerns only few patients with mostly hypomania to moderate mania. Up to date, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are considered as adjunct treatment in mania with psychotic symptoms or hostility. However, survey studies show that antipsychotics are widely used as adjunct treatments to mood stabilisers, indeed beyond the indications held by the guidelines. Our objective was to describe the clinical situations justifying the addition of an adjunct treatment during acute mania and to clear up from published data, the advantages and the inconveniences of combining antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines with a mood stabilisers in order to define differentiated indications. Mania associated with either agitation, sleep disturbances or psychotic symptoms requires most of the time to combine mood stabiliser and respectively, sedative and/or anxiolytic, hypnotic or anti-psychotic treatments. Patients suffering from mania associated with other disorders need specific treatment adjustment and combination related to their medical condition. Adjunctive conventional antipsychotic remains widely used in first intention treatment. The conventional antipsychotic is often prescribed alone in the first weeks prior to the association with a mood stabiliser. Nevertheless there are controversies in the literature about their efficiency and their delay of action with regard to other treatments. When the conventional antipsychotic is a part of their initial treatment, manic patients remain taking them when discharged from hospital and are still taking them after 6 Months in a great percentage of the cases. The adverse events with conventional antipsychotic are numerous and severe enough in bipolar patients to restrict their use in first intention mainly to psychotic mania. Moreover, there are evidences for higher sensitivity to adverse effects of the conventional antipsychotics in manic patients. When agitation in acute mania requires an adjunct to mood stabiliser, the conventional antipsychotic treatment could be use for over-excitation without catatonic features and with particular care with the risk of akathisia. Long term effects of conventional antipsychotics, especially on depressive recurrences, should argue to stop them as soon as possible. Since the safety of adjunctive new antipsychotics with mood stabilisers seems until now acceptable, its indication should be limited to acute psychotic manias. Adjunctive benzodiazepine, should be evaluated in the various types of mania with specific concerns with comorbidity frequently met in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Benzodiazepines plus mood stabilisers may be the treatment of choice for the manias in which anxious state, catatonic symptoms or sleeplessness.",

Early optimization studies identified the close analogue 10 (K(i): alpha 2 = 16 nM, alpha 3 = 41 nM, alpha 5 = 38 nM, alpha 1 = 280 nM) as a suitable lead for further study. High-affinity ligands were identified by replacing the 6-benzyloxy group of compound 10 with 2-pyridylmethoxy (compound 29), but binding selectivity was not enhanced (K(i): alpha 2 = 1.7 nM, alpha 3 = 0.71 nM, alpha 5 = 0.33 nM, alpha 1 = 2.7 nM). Furthermore, on evaluation in xenopus oocytes,(22) 29 was discovered to be a weak to moderate inverse agonist at all four receptor subtypes (alpha 1, -7%; alpha 2, -5%; alpha 3, -16%; alpha 5, -5%). Replacement of the 3-phenyl group of 29 with alternatives led to reduced affinity, and smaller 3-substituents led to reduced efficacy. Methyl substitution of the benzo-fused ring of 29 at the 7-, 8-, and 10-positions resulted in increased efficacy although selectivity was abolished. Increased efficacy and retention of selectivity for alpha 3 over alpha 1 was achieved with the 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-(7,10-ethano)-phthalazine 62. Compound 62 is currently one of the most binding selective GABA-A alpha 3-benzodiazepine-site partial agonists known, and although its selectivity is limited, its good pharmacokinetic profile in the rat (33% oral bioavailability after a 3 mg/kg dose, reaching a peak plasma concentration of 179 ng/mL; half-life of 1 h) made it a useful pharmacological tool to explore the effect of a GABA-A alpha 2/alpha 3 agonist in vivo.",

There were 139 methadone-positive cases, including 75 in which the death was attributed to combined drug toxicity and 23 to methadone toxicity alone. Methadone was most frequently used in conjunction with other prescription or illicit drugs, most commonly benzodiazepines and/or cocaine. There was considerable overlap in the postmortem blood methadone concentrations among the groups. Concentrations ranged from 0.114 mg/L-1.939 mg/L (mean .0559 mg/L) in cases where death was attributed to methadone toxicity; 0.050 mg/L-1.903 mg/L (mean 0.411 mg/L) in cases of combined drug toxicity; 0.069 mg/L-0.644 mg/L (mean 0.224 mg/L) in deaths attributed to other drugs; 0.062 mg/L-1.090 mg/L (mean 0.344 mg/L) among deaths attributed to natural causes and 0.072 mg/L-2.7 mg/L (mean 0.605 mg/L) among deaths due to trauma. The concentrations of methadone detected indicate that it may not be possible to establish a lethal methadone range because some deaths occurred at methadone concentrations below previously reported lethal ranges, and because of the presence of other drugs. Determining the cause of death in methadone-positive cases necessitates correlation with autopsy results and investigative findings.",

This study investigated the role played by the polypeptide hormone gastrin, specifically its antiapoptotic effects through activation of protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt). In esophageal cell lines with low basal levels of activated PKB/Akt, phosphorylation could be induced by exogenous amidated gastrin. High basal levels of activated PKB/Akt were linked to endogenous gastrin expression and were reduced by treatment with a cholecystokinin-type 2 receptor (CCK-2R) antagonist. Expression of a constitutively active splice variant of the CCK-2R additionally increased basal activation of PKB/Akt. It is proposed that gastrin acting in an autocrine and endocrine manner via a CCK-2R isoform may activate PKB/Akt and that with expression of gastrin and CCK-2R isoforms increasing in BM samples, gastrin may aid progression of BM through amplification of antiapoptotic pathways. Evidence for this proposal was provided through the observed specific up-regulation of PKB/Akt in BM samples.", 
    "172": "The globus pallidus is believed to play a critical role in the normal function of the basal ganglia, and abnormal activity of its neurons may underlie some basal ganglia motor symptoms. A high density of benzodiazepine binding sites on GABAA receptors has been reported in the rat globus pallidus. The present study investigates the effect of activating the benzodiazepine site by the agonist zolpidem. In in vitro slices, 100 nM of zolpidem significantly prolonged the half decay time of both miniature and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents by 30.1 +/- 3.0% (n=12) and 17.8 +/- 2.4% (n=16), respectively, with no effect on their amplitudes and frequencies. In the behaving animal, when zolpidem was microinjected into the globus pallidus unilaterally, it caused a robust ipsilateral rotation (26.4 +/- 2.4 turns/30 min, n=8), significantly higher than that of control animals receiving vehicle injection (1.3 +/- 1.6 turns/30 min, n=6). This effect was in agreement with the in vitro effect of zolpidem in enhancing the action of GABA on postsynaptic GABAA receptors. All the effects of zolpidem, in vitro or in vivo, were sensitive to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, confirming the specificity on the benzodiazepine site. This finding on the effect of zolpidem on motor behavior provides a rationale for further investigations into its potential in the treatment of motor disorders originating from the basal ganglia.",
