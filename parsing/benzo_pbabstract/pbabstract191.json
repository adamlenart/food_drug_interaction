    "0": "Olanzapine is structurally similar to clozapine but has not been shown at routine doses to share the superiority of clozapine to traditional antipsychotics in treatment-resistant patients. Olanzapine, however, has been increasingly used in higher doses as clinicians attempt to find a more tolerable therapy for those refractory to conventional agents. This study examined the relationship of high-dose olanzapine plasma concentrations to symptoms, adverse effects, smoking, and gender. Thirteen patients participated in a double blind 16-week crossover study (8 weeks each arm) of olanzapine (50 mg/day) compared to clozapine (450 mg/day). Women had significantly higher plasma olanzapine levels than men at each time point in each arm (weeks 4, 6, and 8). At 8 weeks women had a steady-state olanzapine level of 278 +/- 62 ng/ml while men had a steady-state level of 127 +/- 47 ng/ml (p = 0.005). At week 4, olanzapine levels tended to be higher in those who had been on clozapine previously (205 ng/ml) compared to those who received olanzapine in the first arm (105 ng/ml). Cigarette intake was negatively correlated to olanzapine plasma concentrations (week 8: r = -0.86, p < 0.05). Plasma levels were significantly higher in those experiencing constipation (176 vs. 82 ng/ml; p = 0.022). Plasma levels of olanzapine were not associated with symptom response and anticholinergic effects were seen at greater frequency with higher olanzapine concentrations. In conclusion, this study reports plasma olanzapine levels at high fixed doses of olanzapine (50 mg/day) in relation to side effects, symptoms, smoking, and gender.", 
    "1": "Among Cardiovascular Health Study participants who died from coronary heart disease, the authors compared those with incident and definite congestive heart failure (CHF) (n=60; 15%) and those with prevalent or probable CHF (n=70; 17.5%) to those with no history of CHF (n=198; 50%) concerning health status at the end of life. Both CHF groups had worse health status before death than the group without CHF. Patients in the CHF groups were more likely to use benzodiazepines (20% and 19% vs. 6%; p=0.001) and to rate their health as fair or poor (68% and 63% vs. 41%; p<0.001). They were more likely to be hospitalized (33% and 28% vs. 11%; p<0.001), to have activity restrictions (79% and 62% vs. 38%; p<0.001), and to report a wide array of physical symptoms. These data suggest that patients who die from coronary heart disease in the presence of CHF have greater need for hospice or palliative care than those with no history of CHF.",

Autoradiography was used to map GABA(A) ((3)H-Muscimol), benzodiazepine ((3)H-Flunitrazepam), mu ((3)H-DAMGO), and delta ((3)H-DPDPE) opioid receptor binding in adult Proechimys guyannensis brain under normal conditions. Results were compared with values obtained from adult Wistar rats. Proechimys presented reduced (3)H-Muscimol binding in several cortices, thalamus, medial amygdala nucleus, and dorsal dentate gyrus. (3)H-Flunitrazepam binding was reduced in periaqueductal gray, frontal and entorhinal cortices, and enhanced in piriform cortex and ventral CA2 field of Ammons horn. Concerning (3)H-DAMGO binding, high values were found in several cortices, medial amygdala nucleus, dorsal dentate gyrus, and periaqueductal gray, whereas reduced binding was detected in anterior olfactory tubercle, cingulated cortex, thalamus, basolateral amygdala, substantia nigra, and dorsal and ventral CA fields. High (3)H-DPDPE binding was noticed in CA1 field from dorsal hippocampus, while reduced values were found in cingulate cortex, olfactory tubercle, thalamus, and substantia nigra. These findings provide the first description of receptor binding distribution of the Proechimys brain and suggest natural endogenous anticonvulsant mechanisms of theses rodents under normal conditions.",

    "24": "The effects of ethanol on the GABA(A) receptors, which are regarded as one of the most important target sites of ethanol, are very controversial, ranging from potentiation to no effect. The delta subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes were recently reported to be potently augmented by ethanol. We performed patch-clamp experiments using the cerebellar granule cells and mammalian cells expressing recombinant GABA(A) receptors. In granule cells, the sensitivity to GABA increased from 7 to 11 days in vitro. Furosemide, an antagonist of alpha6-containing GABA(A) receptors, inhibited GABA-induced currents more potently at 11 to 14 days than at 7 days. Ethanol at 30 mM had either no effect or an inhibitory effect on currents induced by low concentrations of GABA in granule cells. On alpha4beta2delta, alpha6beta2delta, or alpha6beta3deltaGABA(A) receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, ethanol at 10, 30, and 100 mM had either no effect or an inhibitory effect on GABA currents. Ethanol inhibition of GABA(A) receptor was observed in all of the subunit combinations examined. In contrast, the perforated patch-clamp method to record the GABA currents revealed ethanol effects on the alpha6beta2delta subunits ranging from slight potentiation to slight inhibition. Ethanol seems to exert a dual action on the GABA(A) receptors and the potentiating action may depend on intracellular milieu. Thus, the differences between the GABA(A) receptors expressed in mammalian host cells and those in Xenopus oocytes in the response to ethanol might be due to changes in intracellular components under patch-clamp conditions.", 
    "25": "Cyclooxygenase (COX) is reported to play a significant role in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, and may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Various neurotransmitter abnormalities, especially of GABA and glutamate, have been reported to play a key role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced (80 mg/kg) convulsions in mice with possible mechanism of action. Various COX-inhibitors were administered 45 min prior to the PTZ administration. Onset, duration of clonic convulsions and percentage mortality/recovery were recorded. Pretreatment with COX-inhibitors aspirin (10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.), naproxen (7 and 14 mg/kg, p.o.), nimesulide (1-5 mg/kg, p.o.) or rofecoxib (1-4 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently showed protection against PTZ-induced convulsions. COX-2 inhibitors were more effective as compared to non-selective COX-inhibitors. Rofecoxib (1 mg/kg) or nimesulide (1 mg/kg) also enhanced the sub-protective effect of diazepam or muscimol showing GABAergic modulation of COX-2 inhibitors. COX-2 inhibitors also antagonized the effect of flumazenil (4 mg/kg)- against PTZ-induced convulsions further confirming the GABAergic mechanism. In conclusion, the results of the present study strongly suggest the possible role of cyclooxygenase isoenzymes in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and the use of COX-inhibitors as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of epilepsy.", 
    "26": "Evidence suggests that the developing adolescent brain may be especially vulnerable to long-term neurobehavioral consequences following ethanol exposure and withdrawal. In the present study, we examined the long-term effect of adolescent ethanol withdrawal on a subsequent EtOH-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Periadolescent and adult C3H mice were exposed to 64 h of continuous (single withdrawal) or intermittent (multiple withdrawal) ethanol vapor. Following each ethanol exposure, animals received either 0, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg diazepam (DZP) in an attempt to counteract the possible effect of ethanol withdrawal. About 6 weeks following ethanol and DZP treatment, animals were tested for an EtOH-induced CTA. As expected, exposure to EtOH during adolescence attenuated the EtOH-induced CTA as compared to controls. Unexpectedly, administration of DZP during withdrawal did not spare but rather mimicked the attenuation of the EtOH-induced CTA seen in animals exposed to ethanol in adolescence. This attenuation was not evident when EtOH and/or DZP was administered in adulthood. Given the similar mode of action of EtOH and DZP on the GABA system, the principal implication of the present findings is that the intoxicating effect of ethanol on the developing brain can result in long-term changes in the aversive properties of EtOH.", 
    "27": "Human serum albumin (HSA) is an abundant plasma protein that transports a wide variety of drugs and endogenous compounds. The complex binding capacity of HSA has made it a challenging system to study in detail but in order to develop our understanding of the interactions between ligands for HSA, the locations and relative affinities of different ligand binding sites must be determined. Albumin possesses multiple binding sites for its primary physiological ligand, non-esterified fatty acids (FA). Previously, titration of BSA with (13)C-labeled FA revealed multiple chemical shifts and allowed identification of a subset of three chemical shifts that were associated with high affinity FA binding. Recent crystallographic studies of HSA have mapped at least seven FA binding sites for long-chain FA and delineated the overlap with binding sites for drugs and other endogenous compounds. We aim to correlate NMR and structural data for FA to provide a more complete description of the binding capacity of HSA. Our recent mutagenesis studies allowed us to identify two high affinity binding sites in domain III of HSA. Here, we use NMR to study the binding of (13)C-carboxyl labeled palmitate to HSA in the presence and absence of competitor ligands to complete the correlation of NMR chemical shifts with specific structural binding sites. We carefully selected ligands with specific binding sites identified by crystallography and used them, either singly or in combination, to compete with [(13)C]palmitate for binding to HSA. We show that FA sites 2, 4 and 5 bind FA with high affinity, while sites 1, 3, 6 and 7 exhibit low affinity for FA, thus providing the first complete determination of relative affinities of all seven long-chain FA sites on HSA. Our results also yield direct insights into the interactions between FA and other ligands.", 
    "28": "1-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-ethyl-7,8-dimethoxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (tofisopam) contains one chiral center, so two enantiomeric forms exist. The ring system of tofisopam possesses two sterically stable boat structures, leading to two distinct conformers for each enantiomer. A method was developed for the separation of these enantiomers and conformers in the drug substances and drug products. Separation was achieved with a separation factor of at least 3.9 for any adjacent peaks. Validation of the method challenged linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, specificity, accuracy, repeatability, intermediate precision, robustness, and stability of standard and sample solutions, and all validation results met the acceptance criteria. A study of accuracy at 80%, 100%, and 120% levels gave recoveries of 100 +/- 1%. The RSD of six sample injections for repeatability was less than 0.5%. The detection limit of tofisopam enantiomer was as low as 0.12 microg/mL. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the interconversion of tofisopam conformers were also investigated, and the kinetic and equilibrium constants of the interconversion process were determined at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C.", 
    "29": "Status epilepticus in patients often does not respond to first-line anticonvulsants, and subsequent treatment escalation with continuous intravenous anesthetics may be associated with significant side-effects. Therefore, alternative treatment regimens are urgently needed. Hypothermia has been shown to reduce excitatory transmission and may thus serve as an interesting adjunct in the management of status epilepticus. In the current experiments, three treatment groups were compared. Animals with self-sustaining status epilepticus were treated with external cooling for 3 h, with low-dose diazepam, or with a combination of both. The effect of these regimens on epileptic activity was compared with untreated controls. Animals that underwent cooling were rewarmed, and all animals were monitored for 5 h to assess occurrence and severity of motor seizures and frequency and amplitude of spontaneous epileptic discharges. Cooling alone significantly reduced number and severity of motor seizures but did not alter epileptic discharges. Cooling in addition to low-dose diazepam significantly diminished amplitudes and frequencies of epileptic discharges, while diazepam alone had only a minor reducing effect on discharge amplitudes. However, at later stages of status epilepticus, diazepam significantly reduced motor seizures. Following rewarming, the discharge frequency tended to increase again, suggesting partial reversibility. The current experiments show that in status epilepticus hypothermia exhibits anticonvulsant effects which are most pronounced if co-administered with low-dose diazepam. The results still require confirmation in other animal models and also clinical studies are urgently needed. However, our data indicate that cooling could well become a future adjunct in the treatment of status epilepticus in patients.",

Abnormal involuntary movements (mean change in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale: -3.20, P<0.001) and quality of life were significantly improved in patients treated with olanzapine. However, some patients experienced significant weight gain (3.60+/-4.50 kg, P<0.001) with olanzapine treatment, relative to baseline.",

    "34": "A vasopressin V(1B) receptor antagonist has been shown to exhibit anxiolytic effects in a variety of animal models of anxiety. In the present study, we examined the involvement of the pituitary in the anxiolytic effects of a vasopressin V(1B) receptor antagonist by conducting a social interaction test in rats. In the sham-operated rats, both the vasopressin V(1B) receptor antagonist SSR149415 and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide significantly increased the social behavior of a pair of unfamiliar rats, and the blood adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were markedly increased during the social interaction test. Hypophysectomy also increased the length of time that the animals engaged in social behavior to the same extent as that observed after treatment of the sham-operated rats with anxiolytics. However, while chlordiazepoxide further increased the duration of social interaction in the hypophysectomized rats, the anxiolytic effects of SSR149415 was no longer observed in these animals. These results suggest that the anxiolytic effects of the vasopressin V(1B) receptor antagonist in the social interaction test are mediated through blockade of the vasopressin V(1B) receptor in the pituitary.", 
    "35": "We investigated whether vagal cardiac cholinergic facilitation by nitric oxide (NO) is mediated by cardiac muscarinic receptor subtypes in the vagally innervated rat right atrium in vitro. Experiments were carried out in the presence of atenolol (4 microM). The right vagus was stimulated at 4, 8, 16, 32 Hz; pulse duration 1 ms at 20 V for 20s; vagal postganglionic activation was achieved using nicotine (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1mM) and the effect on cardiac interval (ms) assessed. Pirenzepine (1 microM), a M1 antagonist, attenuated vagally induced increase in cardiac interval. L-Arginine (0.34 mM) superfused with pirenzepine failed to reverse this attenuation, however, L-arginine applied alone reversed the reduction vagal cardiac slowing. Similarly, sodium nitroprusside (10 microM) applied alone, and not together with pirenzepine, was able to reverse the attenuation of vagal effects caused by pirenzepine. Synthetic MT7 (1 nM) toxin, a selective M1 antagonist confirmed these results. M3 antagonism using para-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (p-F-HHSiD) (300 nM) and M4 antagonism with PD 102807 (200 nM) did not affect the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval. Nicotine induced increase in cardiac interval was not altered by pirenzepine. These results show that antagonism of M1 receptors on cardiac vagal preganglionic fibres reduces vagal efficacy which can be recovered by either a nitric oxide synthase substrate or a NO donor.",

    "38": "OL was found to be superior to RP, FGAs and CA in terms of quality of life. FGAs revealed greater therapeutic benefit than RP, which was more beneficial than combined therapy. Improvement in Q-LES-Q was revealed in patients who received antidepressants and anxiolytics, but not mood stabilizers, or anti-Parkinson drugs. This effect was independent of treatment groups and gender. Regression models revealed that changes in emotional distress and side effects were common predictors for HRQL changes across treatment groups. Specific predictors of HRQL efficacy included self-efficacy for OL, negative and positive symptoms for RP, dysphoric mood and positive symptoms, daily doses and self-efficacy for FGA treated patients.",

Typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol, have limited or even detrimental influence on cognitive functions. In contrast, atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine and olanzapine, may improve memory function in schizophrenics. However, only a few studies have been conducted to directly compare the effects of olanzapine, clozapine and haloperidol on memory functions in animal models. Thus, their effects on this issue were investigated in the present studies by using one-way step-through passive avoidance task and Morris water maze as models of learning and memory. The results showed that olanzapine did not affect acquisition, consolidation or retrieval process in step-through test. Moreover, it improved spatial learning function in mice in Morris water maze task. Clozapine and haloperidol appeared to impair acquisition process and consolidation process, respectively, in step-through test. Both drugs impaired spatial learning function in mice in Morris water maze task. The results suggested a positive implication for the clinical medication of olanzapine in schizophrenic treatment.",

Spatial learning and memory were assessed by Morris water maze test for 5 days. After the behavioral testing all rats were decapitated and the hippocampus was removed immediately. Then, the synaptosomes in hippocampus were purified by density gradient centrifugation.

On the 5th day of behavioral testing the D-galactose-induced aging rats presented significant impairment in water maze performance compared with the NS controls (P < 0.001). The decrease in specific [(3)H] PK11195 binding in the hippocampus synaptosomes of the D-galactose-treated group was 67.3 +/- 18.6 fmol/mg, significantly lower than that of the saline control group (127.9 +/- 20.1 fmol/mg, P < 0.01).

    "58": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) initially characterised as a high affinity binding site for diazepam, is densely distributed in most peripheral organs whilst only moderately expressed in the healthy brain. The predominant cell type expressing the PBR at regions of central nervous system (CNS) pathology are activated microglial cells. Under neuroinflammatory conditions there is an over-expression of PBR binding sites indicating that measurements of PBR density can act as a useful index of brain disease activity. The PBR is now considered a significant therapeutic and diagnostic target which has provided the impetus for PBR ligand development. There are several classes of PBR ligands available including benzodiazepines (Ro5-4864), isoquinoline carboxamides (PK 11195), indoleacetamides (FGIN-1-27), phenoxyphenyl-acetamides (DAA1106) and pyrazolopyrimidines (DPA-713). Subsequent conformationally restrained isoquinoline and indoleacetamide analogues have been synthesised in an attempt to yield PBR ligands with superior affinity and brain kinetics. Even though the PBR has been linked to a number of biochemical processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, steroidogenesis, porphyrin transport and immunomodulation, its exact physiological role is yet to be deciphered. Selective PBR ligands with favourable in vivo binding properties and kinetics is required to gain a more complete understanding on the normal functioning of the PBR and the chemical pathways underlying several pathological conditions. Novel PBR ligands with unique binding properties and functional activity may also generate information on the localisation of the PBR and the possibility of PBR subtypes. This review highlights the main classes of PBR ligands to date. In addition the biological activity and therapeutic potential of certain PBR ligands is discussed.",

After controlling for potential confounders, the decision to prescribe was significantly associated with a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and the preexisting use of psychotropic medications. Nonprescribing occurred most often in discharged patients who had suicidal ideation, substance abuse or dependence, and an existing outpatient psychiatrist.

    "71": "In conditions in which rats had a free choice between dark and light chambers, microinjections of glutamic acid, serotonin, and campiron into the globus pallidus showed that these agents have antiaversive properties in a threatening situation test but not in an illuminated area test. Dopamine, apomorphine, GABA, chlordiazepoxide, phenibut, and indoter injected locally into this formation of the basal ganglia had no effect on the mechanisms of voluntary movement but counteracted anxiety states in both behavioral models. These results provide evidence that the monoaminergic and aminoacidergic systems of the dorsal pallidum have different functional roles in the operative regulation of behavior for aversive stimuli of different modalities. Prior intraperitoneal administration of functional antagonists of these synaptotropic substances and subsequent microinjection of transmitter monoamines and amino acids and their agonists into the globus pallidus demonstrated the selective involvement of the neurotransmitter systems of the dorsal pallidum in the antiaversive effects of anxiosedative and anxioselective substances.", 
    "72": "In this review, we conclude that cognitive impairments are as important as positive and negative symptoms in the clinical assessment and management of patients with schizophrenia. This is not a comprehensive review, considering that the new Measurement And Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) model will soon provide valuable data. It is however a product of the collective efforts of a French Canadian clinical research team that proposes a synthesis of data of pragmatic interest to clinicians. Medication with improved safety and cognition profile, gene-rally lead to better outcomes by facilitating compliance with drug regimens and rehabilitation programs. In addition, measures of attention and executive function (EF) appear to improve with novel antipsychotics when compared to traditional neuroleptics. Nevertheless, evaluating cognitive performance is not a routine procedure outside the domain of research. For example, procedural learning (PL) -- an important measure of cognitive function -- refers to cognitive and motor learning processes in which execution strategies cannot be explicitly described (ie learning by doing). These actions or procedures are then progressively learned through trial and error until automation of optimal performance is established. Procedural learning is rarely assessed in clinical practice. Inconsistent findings regarding the effects of neuroleptic drugs on PL have been reported.", 
    "73": "Trials using acute administration of chlorpromazine in normal subjects induced PL deficits, suggesting the direct effect of neuroleptics, presumably via a D(2) dopamine blockade in the striatum. In a recent study by our group, schizophrenia patients, divided into three groups according to their pharmacological treatment (haloperidol, clozapine and risperidone) were compared to normal controls on two PL tasks; a visuomotor learning task (mirror drawing) and a problem solving learning task (Tower of Toronto). No deficits were detected in patients receiving clozapine, while haloperidol was associated with deleterious effects in both tasks. Risperidone, however, produced different effects depending on the task performed. Another 6-month double-blind Canadian study confirmed the beneficial effect of olanzapine on PL compared to haloperidol and risperidone. The differential effects of drugs on the striatal D(2) receptors, -irrespective of their classification as conventional or atypical neuroleptics and the specific process implicated in each of these PL tasks may explain these results. Tracer studies using radioactive benzamides (IBZM) specific to striatal D receptors determined a relationship between striatal D(2) receptor occupancy and PL performance such as the mirror drawing task. Using this method, data obtained in Montreal on schizophrenia patients receiving olanzapine and haloperidol have shown that the coefficient of determination in a visuomotor PL task varied inversely with D2 receptor saturation.", 
    "74": "This review probes the effect of impaired cognitive functions on schizophrenia patients' quality of life. Cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia affect planning, along with the aptitude to initiate and -regulate a goal-directed behaviour. These impairments have been repeatedly, yet inconclusively, attributed to frontal lobe dysfunction. Morphological findings obtained from neuroimaging studies remain inconsistent, some noting no differences between patients and controls while others observing reduced prefrontal volumes in schizophrenia patients. Conversely, functional neuroimaging (fMRI) demonstrated reduced frontal blood flow relative to global cerebral perfusion in schizophrenia patients. Overall, neuroimaging literature provides reliable evidence of frontal impairments in schizophrenia, although the average magnitude of difference between patients and controls is insufficient to defend a frontal lobe dysfunction hypo-thesis, as far as brain volume, resting cerebral metabolism or blood flow are concerned. The only measurement clearly distinguishing between patients and controls is fMRI of the frontal lobe while performing an experimentally controlled task. Here, schizophrenia patients fail to activate their frontal cortex when required. Sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction are Neuropsychological tests of executive function.", 
    "75": "A study conducted in Montreal assessed the relation between EF impairments and difficulties in planning daily activities in schizophrenia patients scoring more than 3 on at least 4 items of the PANSS negative subscale. Performances on EF, memory and script generation were measured and compared to controls. Script production task required that subjects recite 10-20 actions that would normally be carried out for during daily life activity (going to a restaurant, buying groceries, etc.). Patients' performances were significantly lower with higher perserveration and sequencing impairments. Routine activities such as the ability to cook a meal were similarly investigated. Patients were videotaped in a kitchen while preparing a specific meal.", 
    "76": "Optimal sequence of micro- and macro-steps necessary to prepare the meal in a minimal time were measured. Sequencing errors, repetitions and omissions were significantly higher compared to controls. In addition, temporal organization was positively correlated with negative symptoms and low EF performance on neuro-psychological tasks. Thus concluding that EF impairment interferes with basic routine activities in schizophrenia patients, notably those with negative symptoms. Last but not least, we assessed the progress of patients' subjective complaints with regards to their cognitive functions using tests such as the SSTICS, specifically developed to address subjective cognitive complaints and insight.",

Several mobile phases of the composition acetonitrile/acetate buffer 200 mmol/l (pH=3.3, 5.5, 6.5) were employed for this purpose. As follows, the influence of addition of chiral beta-cyclodextrin to the mobile phase on diazepam separation was studied. The interconversion was a concurrence process of separation, resulting from stereolability of the diazepam molecule. The influences of temperature, flow rate, pH, and ionic strength of the mobile phase on interconversion and chromatographic parameters (retention factor and selectivity coefficient) were studied. Complementary off-line NMR measurements were carried out with the goal to confirm the structure of diazepam in the presence of an acid mobile phase.",

The detoxification can be realised in ambulatory or in hospital depending on different modes, with specifies indications for hospitalization. The patient preference intervenes often in the mode of choice for the method. An attentive surveillance clinical, benzodiazepine, hydration and vitamin therapy are essential for good alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "85": "The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, GABA, mediates multiple forms of inhibitory signals, such as fast and slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents and tonic inhibition, by activating a diverse family of ionotropic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). Here, we studied whether distinct GABA(A)R subtypes mediate these various forms of inhibition using as approach mice carrying a point mutation in the alpha-subunit rendering individual GABA(A)R subtypes insensitive to diazepam without altering their GABA sensitivity and expression of receptors. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in hippocampal pyramidal cells from single, double, and triple mutant mice. Comparing diazepam effects in knock-in and wild-type mice allowed determining the contribution of alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5 subunits containing GABA(A)Rs to phasic and tonic forms of inhibition. Fast phasic currents were mediated by synaptic alpha2-GABA(A)Rs on the soma and by synaptic alpha1-GABA(A)Rs on the dendrites. No contribution of alpha3- or alpha5-GABA(A)Rs was detectable. Slow phasic currents were produced by both synaptic and perisynaptic GABA(A)Rs, judged by their strong sensitivity to blockade of GABA reuptake. In the CA1 area, but not in the subiculum, perisynaptic alpha5-GABA(A)Rs contributed to slow phasic currents. In the CA1 area, the diazepam-sensitive component of tonic inhibition also involved activation of alpha5-GABA(A)Rs and slow phasic and tonic signals shared overlapping pools of receptors. These results show that the major forms of inhibitory neurotransmission in hippocampal pyramidal cells are mediated by distinct GABA(A)Rs subtypes.",

After the exclusion of patients who received a tracheotomy before or at the day of admittance, 117 patients were left for analysis. The daily dose (DD; the amount of sedatives for each day) divided by the mean daily dose (MDD; the mean amount of sedatives per day for the study period) in the week before and the week after tracheotomy was 1.07 +/- 0.93 DD/MDD versus 0.30 +/- 0.65 for morphine, 0.84 +/- 1.03 versus 0.11 +/- 0.46 for midazolam, and 0.62 +/- 1.05 versus 0.15 +/- 0.45 for propofol (p < 0.01). However, when we focused on a shorter time interval (two days before and after tracheotomy), there were no differences in prescribed doses of morphine and midazolam. Studying the course in DD/MDD from seven days before the placement of tracheotomy, we found a significant decline in dosage. From day -7 to day -1, morphine dosage (DD/MDD) declined by 3.34 (95% confidence interval -1.61 to -6.24), midazolam dosage by 2.95 (-1.49 to -5.29) and propofol dosage by 1.05 (-0.41 to -2.01). After tracheotomy, no further decrease in DD/MDD was observed and the dosage remained stable for all sedatives.

However, only few scientific studies are available to date, and further research is needed. Amphetamine is the most extensively studied drug shown to promote recovery of function, although clinical data have lead to conflicting results. Other psychostimulants drugs have been proposed, as levodopa or methylphenidate, even if published data are still few. Recently, two studies have been published about the positive role of cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil on stroke recovery. However, such data must still be confirmed by randomized controlled trials. Antidepressant drugs have shown to be effective not only in improving depressive symptoms in stroke patients, but also in decreasing, although partially, the negative impact of poststroke depression on functional outcome. Serotoninergic agents may have a role in improving stroke recovery, in a fashion that is not dependent on their primary antidepressant activity. Last, it is important to be aware that certain drugs as clonidine, prazosin, dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, phenytoin, and phenobarbital could have a detrimental effect on the poststroke recovery.", 
    "91": "Sleep disorder is one of the major symptoms in depression. It can be a risk factor, predictor, or symptom of depressive episodes. Successful therapy of sleep disorder in severely depressed patients can be a problem of its own. So far, there are few data from systematic studies. Definite treatment recommendations and strategies do not exist. The use of sleeping aids is mainly based on clinical experience and arbitrary treatment preferences. This article tries to summarize the difficulties of a rational therapeutic approach to dyssomnia in depressive patients. In addition to medical treatment, the basics of sleep hygiene should be considered. From a pharmacological point of view, sedating antidepressants, short-term add-on benzodiazepines or nonbenzodiazepines, and long-term add-on low potency neuroleptics are considered appropriate treatments. The combination with atypical sedating antipsychotics or low-dose tricyclic antidepressants may be helpful. Drugs which primarily work through serotonin and noradrenalin have negative effects on sleeping disorders since they suppress REM sleep. In contrast to that, GABAergic, antihistaminic, and anticholinergic effects are beneficial for inducing and maintaining sleep. Half-time, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects and interactions, and influence of the drugs on reaction time and personal well-being have to be considered.",

We conducted a double-blind, placebo controlled, single dose, cross-over trial of flumazenil and placebo in 16 subjects with PD. Subjects were primarily assessed with serial tapping tests (1 minute for each hand) at 15-minute intervals for 90 minutes after infusion.

Treatment of his dyspnoe was not optimised, but during care all decisions were based on the actual will of the patient. Generally nocturnal hypoventilation, for instance non-invasive ventilation by BiPAP-mode, can relieve symptoms of dyspnoe in ALS patients. Low-dose morphine and/or benzodiazepine relieve respiratory discomfort and remove the negative spiral of dysnoe-fear-dyspnoe. Oxygen therapy is usually not needed (only in the very last stages of the disease) and is not recommended especially during the night. Hypercapnia can occur because of hypoventilation. This can cause growing unconsciousness and maybe death during sleep. Prolonging life is only possible by invasive long-term ventilation with all the problems of intensive care measures.

It is important to be aware of the specific needs of the patient and of his/her family members, and to competently accompany the patient throughout the decision-making process--such as the decision to end respiratory therapy, for example. Clarifying the situation with the patient and finding out his/her wishes, accompanied by the corresponding documentation, is advisable.", 
    "104": "Dopamine neurotransmission is associated with high susceptibility to cocaine abuse. Positron emission tomography was used in 12 rhesus macaques to determine if dopamine D2 receptor availability was associated with the rate of cocaine reinforcement, and to study changes in brain dopaminergic function during maintenance of and abstinence from cocaine. Baseline D2 receptor availability was negatively correlated with rates of cocaine self-administration. D2 receptor availability decreased by 15-20% within 1 week of initiating self-administration and remained reduced by approximately 20% during 1 year of exposure. Long-term reductions in D2 receptor availability were observed, with decreases persisting for up to 1 year of abstinence in some monkeys. These data provide evidence for a predisposition to self-administer cocaine based on D2 receptor availability, and demonstrate that the brain dopamine system responds rapidly following cocaine exposure. Individual differences in the rate of recovery of D2 receptor function during abstinence were noted.", 
    "105": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the putative anxiolytic-like effects of the aqueous extract of hooks with stem of Uncaria rhynchophylla using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the hole-board apparatus in rats and mice. Control rats were treated with an equal volume of saline, and positive control rats with buspirone (1 mg/kg). Single or repeated treatments of the aqueous extract of Uncaria rhynchophylla (200 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 7 days significantly increased the time-spent and entries into open arms of the EPM, and reduced the time-spent and entries into the closed arms versus saline controls (P<0.05). However, no changes in spontaneous locomotor activity or myorelaxant effects were observed versus saline controls. In the hole-board test, repeated treatment with the aqueous extract of Uncaria rhynchophylla (100 or 200 mg/kg/day, p.o.) significantly increased the number of head-dips (P<0.05). In addition, the anxiolytic-like effects of Uncaria rhynchophylla extract as assessed using the EPM test were abolished by WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. These results suggest that Uncaria rhynchophylla is an effective anxiolytic agent, and acts via the serotonergic nervous system.",

In experiment B, male 18-22 g NIH Swiss mice were pretreated with the 5-HT2 antagonist cinanserin, the 5-HT3 antagonist LY-278,584, the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine or saline and tested in the light/dark exploration test under 70% N2O 30 min after pretreatment.",

By comparison, dopamine turnover in these brain regions was unaltered by N2O exposure. In experiment B, pretreatment with neither cinanserin, LY-278,584 nor fluoxetine had any appreciable effect on the N2O-induced increase in time spent in the light compartment. Only cinanserin significantly reduced the N2O-induced increase in transitions.",

    "111": "There are several hypotheses to explain the lack of an anxiolytic effect on animals with previous maze experience (one-trial tolerance). Some of these hypotheses are related to learning and memory, so the reduction of trial 1 duration to 1 min or amnesic drug administration before trial 1 prevents the lack of an anxiolytic effect in trial 2. Amphetamine and pentylenetetrazole have been shown to enhance memory consolidation when administered immediately after training. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of amphetamine (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) or pentylenetetrazole (30.0 mg/kg), at putative memory-enhancing doses, on the effect of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) in the elevated plus-maze trial 2 on mice exposed to a 1-min long trial 1. Mice were submitted to 1-min trial 1 in the elevated plus-maze immediately followed by drug treatment (saline, amphetamine, or pentylenetetrazole) and to elevated plus-maze trial 2 after 48 h. Animals were treated with vehicle or diazepam 30 min before trial 2. The results showed that post-trial 1 saline and 1.0 mg/kg amphetamine did not induce one-trial tolerance. On the other hand, 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg amphetamine and 30 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole induced a lack of anxiolytic effect of diazepam on trial 2 even with 1-min trial 1 length. Furthermore, these data were not due to novelty exposure in trial 1 or to amphetamine treatment so that mice exposed to an activity chamber instead of the plus-maze (trial 1) and then immediately submitted to amphetamine treatment (2.0 mg/kg) did not show one-trial tolerance 48 h after trial 1. Taken as a whole, these data support the hypothesis that memory is involved in the lack of an anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus-maze trial 2.", 
    "112": "There are few studies on the clinical and neurochemical correlates of postsynaptic cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously found that attenuation of guanine nucleotide-binding (G-) protein coupling to muscarinic M(1) receptors in the neocortex was associated with dementia severity. The present study aims to study whether this loss of M(1)/G-protein coupling is related to alterations in signaling kinases and NMDA receptors. Postmortem frontal cortices of 22 AD subjects and 12 elderly controls were obtained to measure M(1) receptors, M(1)/G-protein coupling, NMDA receptors as well as protein kinase C (PKC) and Src kinase activities. We found that the extent of M(1)/G-protein coupling loss was correlated with reductions in PKC activity and NMDA receptor density. In contrast, Src kinase activity was neither altered nor associated with M(1)/G-protein coupling. Given the well established roles of neuronal PKC signaling and NMDA receptor function in cognitive processes, our results lend further insight into the mechanisms by which postsynaptic cholinergic dysfunction may underlie the cognitive features of AD, and suggest alternative therapeutic targets to cholinergic replacement.", 
    "113": "The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB 269970 (0.25-20 mg/kg) in the behavioral tests commonly used for predicting anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activity. Diazepam and imipramine were used as standard drugs. SB 269970 (in one medium dose of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg) exerted a specific antianxiety-like effect in the Vogel drinking test in rats, in the elevated plus-maze test in rats and in the four-plate test in mice. Moreover, SB 269970 (in one medium dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg) showed antidepressant-like activity in the forced swimming and the tail suspension tests in mice. At the same time, the tested compound at doses of 1-20 mg/kg did not change the spontaneous locomotor activity of mice. The potential anxiolytic and antidepressant effects produced by SB 269970 were weaker than those of the reference drugs employed. It is noteworthy that the active doses of SB 269970 were devoid of any visible motor side-effects. In conclusion, the results of our studies indicate that 5-HT7 receptor antagonists may play a role in the therapy of both anxiety and depression.",

Plasma prolactin levels were measured at baseline, and weeks 3 and 8 after starting titration of olanzapine. Comparisons of plasma prolactin levels between baseline and week 3, and between baseline and week 8 were made by repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test. Two-way ANOVA showed a significant difference in olanzapine-induced prolactin changes between male and female patients (P = 0.037). In male patients (n = 10), the plasma concentration of prolactin at week 3 was significantly higher than at baseline (P = 0.016), but there was no significant difference between the plasma concentration of prolactin at week 8 and at baseline or week 3 (P = 0.191). In female patients (n = 10), there was a significant change of prolactin between baseline and week 3 (P = 0.005), and between baseline and week 8 (P = 0.047). Our results indicate the possibility of gender differences in prolactin elevation induced by olanzapine in Japanese drug-na\u00efve schizophrenic patients.

We tested whether food induces similar effects. Food-deprived male mice were given novel food during 30 min tests in a runway (FR group) that measured locomotor activity. Whereas the activity of this group increased with repeated testing, that of a group exposed to the runways but that received the food in the home cage (FH group), or of a group satiated by prefeeding before testing (SAT group), decreased. When exposed to the runways in the absence of food, the paired group was more active than the other groups (conditioned activity); no activity differences were seen in an alternative, non-food-paired, apparatus. Conditioned activity survived a 3-week period without runway exposure. Conditioned activity was selectively reduced by the opiate antagonist naltrexone (10-20 mg/kg) and by the noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride] (5-10 mg/kg). The D1 antagonist SCH23390 [R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride] (15-30 microg/kg) and D2 antagonist sulpiride (25-125 mg/kg) reduced activity nonspecifically. A single intraperitoneal dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg) or morphine (20 mg/kg) increased activity compared with saline, the stimulant effect being larger in the FR group, suggesting \"cross-sensitization\" to these drugs. However, pretreatment with GYKI 52466 or naltrexone at doses that suppressed conditioned activity in FR animals suppressed cross-sensitization to cocaine. When allowed ad libitum access to food in the runway, FR mice consumed more pellets in a time-limited test. Thus, many of the features of behavioral sensitization to drugs can be demonstrated using food reward and may contribute to excessive eating.", 
    "129": "This study provides the first evidence that CCK-8 (0.01 pM to 0.1 mM) stimulates Na,K-ATPase in the cortical membranes of wild-type and CCK(2) receptor-deficient mice. In each genotype, the maximal stimulation was about 40%. Homozygous mice revealed substantially lower EC50 (4 pM) than heterozygous (37 pM) or wild-type animals (682 pM). In homozygous CCK2 receptor-deficient mice, the expression of CCK1 receptor gene was 5-fold higher than in wild-type animals. CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide counteracted effect of CCK-8 in all three genotypes, whereas CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365, 260 showed significant antagonism in wild-type and heterozygous mice. The cooperativity of Na,K-ATPase for Na+, but not for K+, was lost in homozygous mice. Altogether, very low concentrations of CCK-8 via CCK1 and CCK2 receptors stimulate Na,K-ATPase in the cerebral cortex. CCK2 receptor-deficiency leads to the altered functionality of Na,K-ATPase that might be compensated by CCK1 receptor mediated influence of CCK (and its agonists) on the enzyme.", 
    "130": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor or recognition site (PBR) is a widely distributed transmembrane protein that is located mainly in the outer mitochondrial membrane. The PBR binds to high-affinity drug ligands and cholesterol. Many functions are associated directly or indirectly with the PBR, including the regulation of cholesterol transport and the synthesis of steroid hormones, porphyrin transport and heme synthesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, anion transport, regulation of mitochondrial functions and immunomodulation. Based on these functions, there are many potential clinical applications of PBR modulation, such as in oncologic, endocrine, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Although \"PBR\" is a widely used and accepted name in the scientific community, recent data regarding the structure and molecular function of this protein increasingly support renaming it to represent more accurately its subcellular role (or roles) and putative tissue-specific function (or functions).

The response was blocked in the presence of the selective CCK(B) receptor antagonist CR2945 (1 mg/kg i.v.). The same pattern of cardiovascular and respiratory changes was evoked by microinjection of pentagastrin (0.3 nmol in 250 nL) into the dorsal half of the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG). The effect of intra-PAG administration of pentagastrin was also abolished following injection of CR2945 (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Responsiveness to systemically administered pentagastrin was enhanced in rats in late dioestrus. At the highest dose tested (80 microg/kg), the pressor response, tachycardia and tachypnoea evoked in rats in late dioestrus was significantly higher than rats in proestrus. For rats in oestrus, the pressor response and tachycardia but not tachypnoea were also significantly larger than the response evoked in rats in early dioestrus. The results suggest that the dorsal half of the PAG (dPAG) plays a key role in mediating the cardiovascular and respiratory responses evoked by systemically administered CCK(B) agonists. The enhanced responsiveness to panicogenic agents during late dioestrus may be related to changes in the functional responsiveness of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic circuitry in the dPAG due to plasticity of GABA(A) receptor subunit expression as a consequence of falling progesterone levels.",

Central depression can also be accomplished by a reduction of excitatory transmission. Valerian extracts had modest inhibitory effects on [3H]MK-801 binding, an indicator of NMDA-Valerian interactions. Spectral analyses (UV region) did not show marked differences among the different extracts. The inhibitory effects of one of the extracts on [3H]flunitrazepam binding was somewhat stable, while on [3H]MK-801 binding the inhibitory effects were lost within months.

The 80% methanol extract of Fossilia Mastodi OSSIS given per os at a dose of 3 g/kg in mice showed anxiolysis, potentiation of pentobarbital sleeping time, reduced locomotor activity, and anticonvulsive activity. Fossilia elicited GABA(A) receptor-mediated anxiolysis. The data obtained suggest that the 80% methanol extract of Fossilia Mastodi OSSIS contains some biologically active principles with sedative activity.",

HCT 116 cells were exposed to 50 nmol/L of SJG-136 for 1 hour or 1 nmol/L of SJG-136 for 24 hours to achieve similar levels of interstrand cross-links (ICL). The short exposure led to a rapid formation of ICLs (1 hour), early H2AX foci formation (4 hours), prominent S phase arrest, and greater phosphorylation of Nbs1 (on serine 343) and Chk1 (on serine 317) than a 24-hour exposure. The prolonged exposure at low concentrations of SJG-136 induced a gradual formation of ICLs (up to 24 hours) which was associated with a limited S phase arrest and delayed Nbs1 phosphorylation. Prolonged exposure was also associated with a reduced phosphorylation of p53 on serines 15 and 20, a limited and delayed phosphorylation on serine 392, and a less prominent increase in p21 levels. These data suggest that the 24-hour exposure to a low concentration of SJG-136 led to delayed and reduced DNA damage signaling compared with a higher concentration of SJG-136 for 1 hour, resulting in greater cytotoxicity and contributing to the time-dependent cytotoxic effect of SJG-136.",

The influence of substances binding to the GABA(A) receptor complex, which has been suggested to play an important role in descending pain inhibition on DNIC has not yet been investigated. The aim of the present study was to find out whether the inhibitory action of DNIC might also be mediated by GABAergic mechanisms. Therefore, DNIC modulation via GABAergic mechanisms was studied in a double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design by oral application of 0.02 mg/kg(body weight )lorazepam in 20 healthy subjects. DNIC inhibition was induced by heterotopically administered tonic heat. The inhibitory effect was assessed by use of a multiple staircase method, measuring electrocutaneous detection, and pain thresholds in parallel. Concurrent tonic heat stimuli, at both painful and non-painful levels, significantly increased the electrical pain threshold whereas the electrical detection threshold was not affected. This pain-specific inhibitory effect did not differ significantly between sessions with lorazepam and placebo. Accordingly, lorazepam did not modify the inhibitory action of DNIC although lorazepam generally increased heat pain threshold. The results of the present study provided no evidence for DNIC being mediated by activation of the GABA(A) receptor complex.",

The deduced amino acid sequence was found to be 93% similar to human CYP3A4, 83% similar to human CYP3A5, and identical to the previously reported cynomolgus monkey CYP3A8 (Komori et al., 1992). The substrate specificity of CYP3A64 for testosterone (0-250 microM), midazolam (0-200 microM), nifedipine (0-200 microM), and 7-benzoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (0-200 microM) were compared with recombinant enzymes from rat (CYP3A1, CYP3A2), dog (CYP3A12, CYP3A26), rabbit (CYP3A6), and human (CYP3A4, CYP3A5). Immunoinhibition and chemical inhibition of CYP3A64 was demonstrated using the inhibitory monoclonal antibody (MAb) 10-1-1 (anti-3A4) and ketoconazole (0-10 microM). The utility of CYP3A64 to be used as a standard in monkey induction assays was shown and the concentration of CYP3A64 protein in rhesus liver microsomes was estimated to be 72 pmol/mg protein.

    "183": "GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors and have long been implicated in mediating at least part of the acute actions of ethanol. For example, ethanol and GABAergic drugs including barbiturates and benzodiazepines share many pharmacological properties. Besides the prototypical synaptic GABA(A)R subtypes, nonsynaptic GABA(A)Rs have recently emerged as important regulators of neuronal excitability. While high doses (> or =100 mM) of ethanol have been reported to enhance activity of most GABA(A)R subtypes, most abundant synaptic GABA(A)Rs are essentially insensitive to ethanol concentrations that occur during social ethanol consumption (< 30 mM). However, extrasynaptic delta and beta3 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs, associated in the brain with alpha4 or alpha6 subunits, are sensitive to low millimolar ethanol concentrations, as produced by drinking half a glass of wine. Additionally, we found that a mutation in the cerebellar alpha6 subunit (alpha6R100Q), initially reported in rats selectively bred for increased alcohol sensitivity, is sufficient to produce increased alcohol-induced motor impairment and further increases of alcohol sensitivity in recombinant alpha6beta3delta receptors. Furthermore, the behavioral alcohol antagonist Ro15-4513 blocks the low dose alcohol enhancement on alpha4/6/beta3delta receptors, without reducing GABA-induced currents. In binding assays alpha4beta3delta GABA(A)Rs bind [(3)H]Ro15-4513 with high affinity, and this binding is inhibited, in an apparently competitive fashion, by low ethanol concentrations, as well as analogs of Ro15-4513 that are active to antagonize ethanol or Ro15-4513's block of ethanol. We conclude that most low to moderate dose alcohol effects are mediated by alcohol actions on alcohol/Ro15-4513 binding sites on GABA(A)R subtypes.",

In the present study, immobility time, glucose and glycogen mobilization, corticosterone and the effect of desipramine and diazepam were investigated in two different models: swimming stress and the forced swimming test. Immobility time was lower in swimming stress than in the forced swimming test. Both swimming models increased corticosterone levels in comparison with control animal levels. Moreover, swimming stress induced higher corticosterone levels than the forced swimming test did [F(2,14)=59.52; p<0.001].

Preclinical information is used to decide whether a compound will be taken forwards and its pharmacokinetics investigated in human. After proceeding to human little to no use is made of these often very rich data. We suggest a method where the preclinical data are integrated into a whole body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (WBPBPK) model and this model is then used for estimating population PK parameters in human. This approach offers a continuous flow of information from preclinical to clinical studies without the need for different models or model reduction. Additionally, predictions are based upon single parameter values, but making realistic predictions involves incorporating the various sources of variability and uncertainty. Currently, WBPBPK modelling is undertaken as a two-stage process: (i) estimation (optimisation) of drug-dependent parameters by either least squares regression or maximum likelihood and (ii) accounting for the existing parameter variability and uncertainty by stochastic simulation. To address these issues a general Bayesian approach using WinBUGS for estimation of drug-dependent parameters in WBPBPK models is described. Initially applied to data in rat, this approach is further adopted for extrapolation to human, which allows retention of some parameters and updating others with the available human data. While the issues surrounding the incorporation of uncertainty and variability within prediction have been explored within WBPBPK modeling methodology they have equal application to other areas of pharmacokinetics, as well as to pharmacodynamics.",

Ischemic preconditioning (IP) was elicited by 5 min of ischemia followed by 10 min of reperfusion (before the 40-min ischemia period). In two other groups, midazolam was added to flumazenil and IP. Infarct size was determined using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. The authors quantified the hydroxyl-mediated conversion of salicylate to its 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate derivatives during reperfusion by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM.", 
    "212": "Flumazenil, like IP, significantly decreased infarct size (23 +/- 4 and 22 +/- 5%, respectively, vs. 57 +/- 6% in control group; P < 0.01). Midazolam inhibited the effects of flumazenil and IP. Flumazenil and IP significantly limited the increase in the normalized concentrations of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acids. With midazolam, however, the increase was comparable to that of the control group. 5-Hydroxydecanoate, a selective mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K channel blocker, given with flumazenil, abolished the protection obtained with the latter.", 
    "213": "Flumazenil mimics preconditioning to decrease infarct size and hydroxyl radical production during reperfusion. Midazolam, however, abolishes these effects. Blockade of benzodiazepine receptors is upstream to the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K channels in the preconditioning cascade.", 
    "214": "Several case reports and open label trials describe olanzapine in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN). We report 5 adolescents with AN who received olanzapine in addition to psychotherapy for their eating disorder. Body mass index (BMI) of each case increased while on olanzapine. At doses of 5 mg per day and above, patients reported decreased anxiety around eating, improved sleep, and decreased rumination about food and body concerns. Morning sedation was the most commonly reported adverse effect. Olanzapine appeared to be useful in addition to psychotherapy for these adolescents. This report augments a limited literature on the treatment of this disorder, and an almost nonexistent literature specific to pharmacotherapy for adolescents with AN.", 
    "215": "Inhibition is of fundamental importance to regulate activity in cortical circuits. Inhibition is mediated through a diversity of different interneurones and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA(A)R) subtypes. Here we employed paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), a GABA(A)R-mediated inhibition in human motor cortex, to address the question of which GABA(A)R subtype is responsible for this form of inhibition. It has been shown that classical benzodiazepines (diazepam and lorazepam) have a non-selective affinity profile at different alpha-subunit-bearing subtypes of the GABA(A)R while zolpidem has a 10-fold greater affinity to the alpha1-subunit-bearing GABA(A)R compared with those bearing the alpha2- or alpha3-subunit. We found that, in seven healthy subjects, a single oral dose of 20 mg of diazepam or 2.5 mg of lorazepam significantly increased SICI, whereas 10 mg of zolpidem did not change SICI. This dissociation occurred despite equal sedation by all three drugs, an alpha1-subunit GABA(A)R-mediated effect. The findings strongly suggest that SICI is not mediated by the alpha1-subunit-bearing subtype of the GABA(A)R but by those bearing either the alpha2- or alpha3-subunit. This study represents an attempt by means of TMS to identify GABA(A)R subtype-specific action at the systems level of human cortex, a highly relevant issue because the different alpha-subunit-bearing subtypes of the GABA(A)R are differently involved in benzodiazepine-mediated effects such as sedation, amnesia or anxiolysis, in developmental cortical plasticity, and in neurological disorders such as epilepsy."
