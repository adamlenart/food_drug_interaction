    "0": "The highly selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists, SB 204070A (0.001-0.1 mg/kg s.c., 30 min pretest) and SB 207266A (0.01, 1 and 10 mg/kg p.o., 1 hr pre-test), increased time spent in social interaction without affecting locomotor activity, in a rat 15 min social interaction test under high light, unfamiliar conditions. At 1 and 10 mg/kg s.c., SB 204070A was no longer active. These results are consistent with the profile expected of anxiolytic treatments in this procedure. In a rat 5 min elevated x-maze test, SB 204070A (0.01 and 1 mg/kg s.c., 30 min pre-test) significantly increased the percentage of time spent on the open arms. SB 204070A (0.01 mg/kg s.c.) and SB 207266A (1 mg/kg p.o., 1 hr pre-test) also increased percentage entries to the open arms. Neither compound affected locomotion at any dose tested in the procedure. The effects of both compounds in this procedure are also consistent with anxiolysis. Neither SB 204070A (0.1 or 1 mg/kg s.c., 30 min pre-test) nor SB 207266A (0.1 or 1 mg/kg p.o., 1 hr pre-test) affected either unpunished or punished responding, in a rat Geller-Seifter conflict model of anxiety. The maximal efficacy of both SB 204070A and SB 207266A in the rat social interaction test was similar to that of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg s.c. or p.o.) used as a positive control, but was considerably less in the elevated x-maze procedure. The results suggest that 5-HT4 receptor antagonists may have modest anxiolytic-like actions in rats.", 
    "1": "To analyze the effects of antidepressants on the GABAA receptor, we investigated how the chronic administration of antidepressants (10 mg/kg twice a day for three or seven days, ip) influenced the power-spectral changes induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; a GABA antagonist; 27.5 mg/kg) or beta-carboline-3-carboxylic-acid-methylester (beta-CCM; an inverse agonist; 1 mg/kg) on rat hippocampal EEGs. PTZ and beta-CCM are known to inhibit the chloride ionophore and benzodiazepine receptor (GABAA receptor complex), respectively. After the ip injection of both compounds, the EEG power under 12 Hz increased to about five times that before injection. Between the rats that did not receive any antidepressants and all those injected with the drugs for 3 days or treated with desipramine (DMI) for 7 days, there were no apparent changes in the effect of PTZ or beta-CCM. However, in the rats treated with imipramine, fluoxetine or trazodone for 7 days, the increase in power after the injection of PTZ or beta-CCM was apparently suppressed. In these rats, the power values were less than three times those before the dosing of PTZ or beta-CCM. DMI is known to inhibit the re-uptake of norepinephrine (NE), while the other three antidepressants inhibit that of serotonin (5-HT). Trazodone is also reported to block the 5-HT2 sites. These observations might indicate that the chronic administration of antidepressants prompted the function of the GABAA receptor complex. Moreover, it is also suggested that, to that action, the effect of antidepressants on the 5-HT system or interaction between the 5-HT system and GABA receptors might play some role.", 
    "2": "Tandospirone (sedil) is a newly developed anxiolytic drug that has a much higher selective affinity for 5-HT1A than dopamine D2 receptors without the binding affinities with noradrenergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic and GABAergic receptors. This agent binds with 5-HT1A receptors located in both 5-HT neurons in the raphe nucleus and other postsynaptic neurons to induce hyperpolarization of the neurons by opening the K+ channels to eventually inhibit the target neuronal activities. With repeated administrations of tandospirone, a decrease in 5-HT2A receptor population was observed. Behavioral studies in experimental animals have demonstrated that tandospirone inhibits conflict in Vogel methods, aggressive behavior and muricide in manners similar to those of diazepam. In addition, tandospirone showed antistress effects in experimental models and antidepressive effects in forced swimming tests. Unlike diazepam, tandospirone does not produce sedative, sleep-inducing, anticonvulsant, nor muscle relaxant effects at doses effective for conflict tests. Drug dependance, one of the serious problems with bezodiazepine, is not observed with repeated treatment of tandospirone in rats and monkeys. Furthermore, tandospirone has been reported to show a significantly more superior or equipotent effect to diazepam in controlling autonomic disturbances, psychiatric cardiovascular and vegetative syndromes as well as neurosis in double blind clinical studies. These effects are probably due to the selective action of tandospirone on 5-HT1A receptors in the limbic system to eventuate anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. A decrease in 5-HT2A receptor population with repeated treatment of tandospirone may have contributed to the antidepressive effect. Furthermore, 5-HT1A receptors relatively, selectively distributed in the limbic system are not involved in sedation, sleep or muscle relaxation. Such unwanted effects of benzodiazepines are thus not observed with tandospirone treatment.", 
    "3": "New tricyclic antidepressants such as amineptine and tianeptine have mild toxic effects while amoxapine is very toxic. Poisoning with new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants or monoamine-oxidase inhibitors type A (toloxatone, moclobemide) is usually not severe, but life-threatening serotonin syndromes may appear in case of drug combination with antidepressants. Loxapine and clozapine poisoning may lead to death while risperidone intoxication has usually a rather benign course. Substituted benzamide neuroleptics (amisulpride, sultopride) may induce seizures, QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. New hypnotics such as zolpidem and zopiclone have a mild toxicity similar to that of benzodiazepines, but coma and respiratory depression are observed if other drugs or ethanol are ingested or in case of chronic hepatic or respiratory insufficiency.", 
    "4": "To examine the effect of gastrin on spontaneous and induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the hamster.", 
    "5": "Two sets of experiments were carried out, one involving long term hypergastrinaemia and one involving cancer induction during hypergastrinaemia. The effect of hypergastrinaemia accomplished by gastric fundectomy was studied for eight months. Neither fundectomised hamsters nor sham operated controls developed premalignant or malignant pancreatic lesions. In the fundectomy group, the mean pancreatic weight, total protein content, and DNA content was increased by 28%, 25%, and 25% respectively. No such increases were found in fundectomised animals receiving a cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonist during the last 24 days of the experiment. In the cancer induction study, the effect of fundectomy on N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl) amine induced pancreatic carcinogenesis was studied for three months. There were no significant differences in the incidence or [3H]-thymidine labelling index of focal pancreatic lesions between fundectomised and sham operated control animals.", 
    "6": "Fundectomy with chronic hypergastrinaemia induces pancreatic hypertrophy, but does not enhance N-nitrosobis (2-oxopropyl)amine induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the hamster. The increases in growth were inhibited by a cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonist, indicating that the trophic effect of fundectomy is mediated by gastrin.", 
    "7": "Absence seizures represent synchronized burst-firing of thalamocortical neurons, which are driven by tonic GABAergic output of nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT). Activation of GABAA receptors on NRT neurons reduces NRT output and retards thalamocortical burst-firing. Although this mechanism in NRT may underlie antiabsence effects of benzodiazepines, it does not explain observations that barbiturates can worsen absence-seizures. In this study we tested the hypothesis that clonazepam and phenobarbital produce differential effects on GABAA receptors in the lh/lh genetic model of absence seizures after microinjection into NRT compared to VLa, a prototypic relay nucleus containing thalamocortical neurons. In NRT, phenobarbital (16-1600 nmol/cannula), clonazepam (160-2200 pmol/cannula) and muscimol (8.8-263 pmol/cannula) significantly suppressed absence seizure frequency. In VLa, phenobarbital (1.6 nmol) and muscimol (0.88 pmol) increased seizure frequency, whereas higher doses (160 nmol and 88 pmol, respectively) significantly suppressed seizure frequency. In contrast, clonazepam produced no effect on seizure frequency even at a dose of 2.2 nmol; this same dose significantly suppressed absence seizures after microinjection into NRT. These findings suggest that activation of GABAA receptors in NRT may suppress absence seizures, and that phenobarbital may worsen absence seizures through actions on GABAA receptors in thalamocortical cells (VLa). Region-specific GABAA receptor isoforms may underlie the contrasting effects of clonazepam after microinjection into NRT and VLa.", 
    "8": "Following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, rats become chronically epileptic showing 2-3 spontaneous recurrent seizures per week. The aim of this work was to verify the characteristics of spreading depression (SD) in these chronic epileptic rats (n = 16). SD was evoked in one point of the frontal cortex by topical application of KCl solution at 20 min intervals, and recordings were made in two points over the parietal cortex (a 'near' point and a 'remote' one, about 3 and 8 mm posterior to the stimulating region, respectively). In all control animals (n = 10), KCl stimulation elicited SD which in 100% of the cases propagated regularly to the two recording points. In the chronic epileptic rats only about 50% of the KCl applications were effective in eliciting SD, detected at the 'near' recording point. Of these, only 3% propagated to the 'remote' recording point. In eight of the above epileptic rats, diazepam (5-10 mg/kg, i.v.) was injected after 1-2 h of recording, when SD incidence in response to KCl stimulation has been established. After diazepam, the incidence of SDs propagating regularly to the 'near' and to the 'remote' recording points increased significantly, (132 and 53 SDs, respectively, out of 139 KCl stimulations), as compared with the incidence in the pretreatment period (33 and 1, respectively, out of 63 stimulations; P < 0.005). These data indicate an impairment in the susceptibility to cortical SD in chronic epileptic rats suggesting modifications in cortical excitability in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. They also indicate a facilitatory effect of diazepam on SD, confirming previous observations in non-epileptic rats.", 
    "9": "The role of lamotrigine (LTG) in childhood epilepsy is emerging. We evaluated the efficacy and adverse effects of LTG in an open, prospective study of 56 children with generalized epilepsies. Six (11%) children became seizure-free, and 24 (43%) had greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. LTG was effective against a broad range of generalized seizure types. Three of 15 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome achieved complete seizure control and eight demonstrated 50 to 99% improvement in seizure control. Increase in seizures (7) and rash (5) were the most common side effects. After valproate was discontinued, LTG therapy was resumed, with no recurrence of rash in any patient. This study suggests that LTG may be a useful drug in the treatment of generalized epilepsies in children.", 
    "10": "Compulsive buying is defined by the presence of repetitive impulsive and excessive buying leading to personal and familial distress. Patients with this disorder also suffer from mood disorder in 50% to 100% of the cases studied, and antidepressants help to decrease the frequency and the severity of uncontrolled buying. To define the correlation between compulsive buying and depression, we assessed this behavior among 119 inpatients answering to DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive episode. Additionally, we evaluated for comorbidity in the patients suffering from compulsive buying and in those free from this disorder. Impulsivity and sensation seeking were also compared in the two groups.", 
    "11": "Diagnosis of compulsive buying was made using standardized criteria and a specific rating scale. Diagnosis of depression and assessment of comorbidity were investigated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a modified version of the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview. All patients answered the Zuckerman Sensation-Seeking Scale and the Barrat Impulsivity Rating Scale.", 
    "12": "The prevalence of the disorder was 31.9%; 38 of the 119 depressed patients were diagnosed as compulsive buyers. Patients from the compulsive buying group were younger in age, more often women than men, and more frequently unmarried. They presented more often than others with recurrent depression (relative risk = 1.4), disorders associated with deficits in impulse control such as kleptomania (relative risk = 8.5) or bulimia (relative risk = 2.8), benzodiazepine abuse or dependence disorder (relative risk = 4.7), and two or more dependence disorders (relative risk = 1.99). Subscores for experience seeking using the Zuckerman Sensation-Seeking Scale were significantly higher (p = .04) and scores of impulsivity were much higher (p < .0001) than corresponding scores in the group without compulsive buying behavior.", 
    "13": "Compulsive buying is frequent among depressed patients. In most cases, the behavior is associated with other impulse control disorders or dependence disorders and a high level of impulsivity.", 
    "14": "Diazepam has been reported to impair spatial learning in the water maze. This experiment reexamined this topic using control groups that had first been non-spatially pretrained to familiarize them with the general behavioral strategies required in the water maze task. Naive rats given diazepam (0.5, 3.0, 6.0 mg/kg, IP) displayed dose-related maze acquisition impairments and sensorimotor disturbances (swimming in the periphery of the pool, deflecting off or swimming over the hidden platform, jumping off the platform when placed there after a trial, ataxia on a narrow wooden beam). The sensorimotor disturbances interfered with the acquisition of information about the spatial location of the platform, occurred in the absence of impairments in a subsequent visible platform task or swim speed, and correlated strongly with measures of acquisition. In contrast, the non-spatially pretrained groups did not exhibit sensorimotor disturbances in the water maze and acquired the maze task as rapidly under diazepam as control rats. The non-spatially pretrained groups continued to display diazepam-induced sensorimotor disturbances (ataxia) in a novel beam walking task. CGS8216 (10.0 or 20.0 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, attenuated the effect of 3.0 or 6.0 mg/kg diazepam in naive rats, suggesting that the effects of diazepam were mediated by benzodiazepine receptors. Occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors by diazepam does not prevent robust spatial learning in the water maze.", 
    "15": "The aims of this study were to determine: (i) whether clonazepam and CGP37157, which inhibit the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger of isolated mitochondria, could inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux in intact cells; and (ii) whether any sustained increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m) could alter mitochondrial NADH levels. [Ca2+]m was measured in Indo-1/AM loaded rat ventricular myocytes where the cytosolic fluorescence signal was quenched by superfusion with Mn2+. NADH levels were determined from cell autofluorescence. Upon exposure of myocytes to 50 nM norepinephrine (NE) and a stimulation rate of 3 Hz, [Ca2+]m increased from 59 +/- 3 nM to a peak of 517 +/- 115 nM (n = 8) which recovered rapidly upon return to low stimulation rate (0.2 Hz) and washout of NE. In the presence of clonazepam, the peak increase in [Ca2+]m was 937 +/- 192 nM (n = 5) which remained elevated at 652 +/- 131 nM upon removal of the stimulus. CGP37157 in some cells did give the same inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux as clonazepam, but the effect was inconsistent since not all cells were capable of following the stimulation rate in presence of this compound. NADH levels increased upon exposure to rapid stimulation in the presence of NE alone and recovered upon return to low stimulation rates, whereas in clonazepam treated cells the recovery of NADH was prevented. We conclude that clonazepam is an effective inhibitor of mitochondrial [Ca2+] efflux in intact cells and also maintains the increase in NADH levels which occurs upon rapid stimulation of cells.", 
    "16": "Recent studies in the rat demonstrated that systemic administration of muscimol and THIP, both selective GABAA receptor agonists, elevates slow wave activity in the EEG during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In this placebo-controlled study, we assessed the influence of an oral dose of 20 mg THIP on nocturnal sleep in young healthy humans. Compared to placebo, THIP increased slow wave sleep by about 25 min. Spectral analysis of the EEG within NREM sleep revealed significant elevations in the lower frequencies (< 8 Hz) and reductions in the spindle frequency range (approximately 10-16 Hz). In accordance with previous findings in the rat, these data imply that GABAA agonists promote deep NREM sleep, without suppressing REM sleep. These effects are opposite to those induced by agonistic modulators of GABAA receptors such as benzodiazepines and are at variance with established mechanisms according to which GABAA agonists and modulatory agonists would have similar effects. The sleep response to GABAA agonists is highly similar to that evoked by sustained wakefulness, suggesting that GABAA receptors may be implicated in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.", 
    "17": "On the basis of our previous series of experiments we had postulated that the increased anxiety that occurred during diazepam withdrawal was mediated by increased 5-HT release in the hippocampus. The present series of experiments provide evidence for a major role of the median raph\u00e9 nucleus (MRN) dorsal hippocampal pathway. Rats were treated once daily for 21 days with diazepam (2 mg/kg IP) and then tested after 24 h withdrawal in the social interaction test of anxiety. Relative to chronically vehicle treated animals, those withdrawn from diazepam were significantly more anxious and had significantly greater K(+)-evoked release of [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from slices of dorsal and of ventral regions of the hippocampus. Estimation of extracellular concentrations of 5-HT within the dorsal hippocampus, using in-vivo microdialysis, showed doubling in the levels of 5-HT in the rats withdrawn from chronic diazepam treatment. This just failed to reach significance, but 33% of the rats showed dramatic increases (650%). It was not possible to test these animals in the social interaction test, but it is proposed that only the diazepam-withdrawn rats with raised extracellular levels of 5-HT would have displayed increased anxiety. 5-HT1A receptor agonists injected into the MRN decrease the MRN firing rate, and hence the release of 5-HT in the dorsal hippocampus. As a further test of our hypothesis, we examined the effects of MRN injection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH DPAT, on animals withdrawn from diazepam and tested in the low light familiar condition of the social interaction test. 8-OH DPAT (50-200 ng) dose-dependently reversed the anxiogenic effect of diazepam withdrawal, while having no effects in chronic vehicle-treated animals. These results provide clear evidence that the MRN-dorsal hippocampal 5-HT pathway is at least one of the pathways playing an important role in mediating diazepam withdrawal-induced anxiety.", 
    "18": "Panic disorder and addiction are occasionally comorbid--4.5% of addicted patients have panic disorder, and 16% of panic disorder patients are comorbid for addiction to alcohol and other drugs. Despite these relatively low rates of comorbidity, the treatment of these two disorders is commonly confounded by issues of comorbidity, as many physicians avoid using benzodiazepines to treat panic disorder out of inappropriate fear of addiction, and not a few physicians treat panic disorder thinking that they will thereby end comorbid addiction. Sound clinical practice calls for clear identification of both panic disorder and addiction and fully effective treatments of the diseases from which the patients suffer.", 
    "19": "1. In addition to binding to GABAA receptors in the central nervous system, benzodiazepines have also been reported to recognize high affinity binding sites in several different peripheral tissues. 2. These peripheral benzodiazepine receptors likely consist of distinct integral membrane proteins, which are predominantly localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane and may be associated to form a heteropolymeric receptor complex. One such protein, identified for its ability to bind a class of benzodiazepines and isoquinolines, has been purified and the corresponding complementary DNA (cDNA) has been cloned and characterized. Furthermore, the structure of the rat gene encoding this protein has been clarified, thus potentially opening new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for receptor regulation. 3. Although the exact physiologic and/or pharmacologic role of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors is still unknown, their wide tissue distribution suggests an involvement in many cellular phenomena. 4. In particular, several lines of investigation indicate that these receptors, densely expressed on airway smooth muscle of various species, may contribute to the modulation of bronchomotor tone and perhaps to the pathogenesis of asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness.", 
    "20": "Triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, is metabolized by CYP3A4. Diltiazem is an inhibitor of this isozyme. The aim of this study was to determine if diltiazem affects plasma concentrations of triazolam in humans.",

Seven healthy male volunteers received orally either a single 0.25 mg dose of triazolam, a 0.25 mg dose of triazolam after a 3-day treatment of diltiazem (180 mg day-1), or a placebo. Plasma samples were collected to determine triazolam concentration over a 24 h period. The pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam were investigated using the peak saccadic velocity of eye movements (PSV), electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual analogue scale (VAS) through 8 h.",

    "23": "Diltiazem markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of triazolam and increases the intensity of its sedative effects. Inhibition of CYP3A isozyme by diltiazem may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Therefore, triazolam should be avoided when patients are using diltiazem.", 
    "24": "The authors report the assessment of 2 patients on interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia who developed manic symptoms long after IFN-alpha therapy had been initiated. These cases suggest that chronic IFN-alpha therapy may be associated with vulnerability for developing overt psychiatric symptoms, particularly in cases where the patient is experiencing psychosocial stress, and that the current definition of persistent adverse effects of IFN-alpha should be broadened to include the occurrence of manic episodes.", 
    "25": "Corticosteroids upregulate the beta-adrenergic pathway, but little is known about corticosteroid regulation of muscarinic pathways. Basenji-greyhound (BG) dogs treated for 3 days with methylprednisolone (MPS) but not deoxycorticosterone (DOC) had decreased numbers of muscarinic receptors in airway smooth muscle homogenates as determined by radioligand binding with 1-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (vehicle control, 578 +/- 53 fmol/mg protein; MPS, 290 +/- 22 fmol/mg protein; DOC, 565 +/- 141 fmol/mg protein). Competition radioligand binding with the M2-selective antagonist tripitramine showed a decrease in both the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors with no changes in receptor affinities (M2: vehicle control, 478 +/- 41 fmol/mg protein; MPS, 265 +/- 20 fmol/mg protein, M3: vehicle control, 89 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein; MPS, 25 +/- 16 fmol/mg protein). In vitro treatment of airway smooth muscle from control BG dogs with MPS had no effect on muscarinic receptor number, despite increased expression of beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus glucocorticoids indirectly decrease the expression of M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors in airway smooth muscle, which, in part, may account for their beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma.", 
    "26": "1. Protooncogene c-fos mRNA levels were determined in the rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum after exposure to a combined forced swimming and confinement stress. The stress resulted in an increase in c-fos mRNA levels in all three brain areas. 2. In an effort to elucidate the neurotransmitter systems involved in this stress-induced increase, animals were injected, prior to exposure to the stress, with either diazepam, MK-801, or propranolol. 3. In both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus the stress-induced increase in c-fos mRNA was inhibited by MK-801, suggesting that it is mediated via NMDA receptors. In the hippocampus, propranolol had a similar effect, indicating that beta-adrenergic receptors are also involved in the stress-induced increase in c-fos mRNA. 4. On the other hand, the increase in c-fos mRNA produced by the stress of the injection was inhibited in the cerebral cortex by diazepam or propranolol and in the hippocampus only by diazepam. Furthermore, administration of MK-801 resulted in an increase in c-fos mRNA in the hippocampus of the nonstressed animals. In the cerebellum no one of the three drugs employed affected c-fos mRNA levels in either stressed or nonstressed animals. 5. Our results thus show that various forms of stress activate, in different brain areas, neurons with either NMDA, beta-adrenergic, and/or GABA-A receptors.",

Intravenous administration of phenytoin had no effect on ALS. A small dose of intravenous diazepam reduced a suppression-burst pattern. We speculate that the ALS originates in the midline structures, spreading bilaterally and synchronously to the \"dysfunctional\" cortex; the sustained discharges were a manifestation of associated reticular lesions, and we believe that intravenous diazepam suppressed the spread of ALS to the \"dysfunctional cortex,\" leading to the appearance of the suppression-burst pattern.

Thirty minutes after midazolam i.m., the level of sedation in the volunteers was assessed. Peripheral venous blood was obtained immediately after the assessment of the level of sedation.

The decreases in tympanic membrane temperatures at 30 min after midazolam i.m. became larger as the volunteers were more deeply sedated. i.m. midazolam produced a concentration-dependent decrease in tympanic membrane temperature at 30 min after midazolam 0.025 and 0.075 mg kg-1 i.m. We conclude that midazolam impaired tonic thermoregulatory vasoconstriction, allowing core-to-peripheral heat redistribution in a dose-dependent manner after i.m. administration.",

    "44": "We describe seven patients who developed symptoms including severe headache, circumoral paresthesia, and facial flushing during high-dose carmustine (BCNU) infusion as part of the preparative regimen for autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation for metastatic breast cancer. Five patients responded to pain medications, including partial and complete opiate receptor agonists. Premedication of subsequent doses of BCNU with corticosteroids, pain medications, or benzodiazepines lessened, but did not prevent the same symptoms from recurring. The incidence and mechanism of this toxicity are unknown, but this adverse syndrome should be considered when administering high-dose BCNU infusions.", 
    "45": "Buprenorphine (BUP) is an alternative to methadone (METH) maintenance. However, there are few studies on the switching of patients from METH to BUP. Eighteen volunteers who had been maintained on METH for 1-19 years were recruited for a residential cocaine self-administration study. All subjects were maintained on 60 mg METH for up to 1 1/2 weeks before the 7-day changeover (60, 40, 30, 30, 0 mg METH; 4, 8 mg BUP). Fifteen subjects successfully completed the transfer from METH to BUP, experiencing moderate withdrawal symptoms, as measured by the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS). Withdrawal symptoms were the highest during the first assessment of the day, at the time of BUP administration. SOWS scores returned to baseline 4 days after the switchover. This study demonstrates that within a supportive inpatient setting, research volunteers can be rapidly switched from high-maintenance doses of METH to BUP with an acceptable degree of tolerability.", 
    "46": "Six Welsh gelding ponies were premedicated with 0.03 mg/kg of acepromazine intravenously (i.v.) prior to induction of anaesthesia with midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg and ketamine at 2 mg/kg i.v.. Anaesthesia was maintained for 2 h using 1.2% halothane concentration in oxygen. Heart rate, electrocardiograph (ECG), arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, blood gases, temperature, haematocrit, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), dynorphin, beta-endorphin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, glucose and lactate concentrations were measured before and after premedication, immediately after induction, every 20 min during anaesthesia, and at 20 and 120 min after disconnection. Induction was rapid, excitement-free and good muscle relaxation was observed. There were no changes in heart and respiratory rates. Decrease in temperature, hyperoxia and respiratory acidosis developed during anaesthesia and slight hypotension was observed (minimum value 76 +/- 10 mm Hg at 40 mins). No changes were observed in dynorphin, beta-endorphin, ACTH, catecholamines and glucose. Plasma cortisol concentration increased from 220 +/- 17 basal to 354 +/- 22 nmol/L at 120 min during anaesthesia; plasma AVP concentration increased from 3 +/- 1 basal to 346 +/- 64 pmol/L at 100 min during anaesthesia and plasma lactate concentration increased from 1.22 +/- 0.08 basal to 1.76 +/- 0.13 mmol/L at 80 min during anaesthesia. Recovery was rapid and uneventful with ponies taking 46 +/- 6 min to stand. When midazolam/ketamine was compared with thiopentone or detomidine/ketamine for induction before halothane anaesthesia using an otherwise similar protocol in the same ponies, it caused slightly more respiratory depression, but less hypotension. Additionally, midazolam reduced the hormonal stress response commonly observed during halothane anaesthesia and appears to have a good potential for use in horses.", 
    "47": "Global cerebral ischemia leads to selective neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus and in the striatum. This ischemia leads to a deficit in spatial learning and memory in the water maze. The results of earlier studies that have examined the relationship between neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze were not clear-cut. It has been observed that neuroprotection reduces both the deficit in the water maze and the neuronal damage. The present study therefore approached the relationship between the neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze by pharmacological means. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats by four-vessel occlusion for 20 min. Ischemic rats were then treated with the noncompetitive non-NMDA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg), the radical scavenger LY 231617 (20 mg/kg), the inhibitor of protein kinase C staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg), or solvent. Treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial learning by limiting the increase in swim distance due to ischemia. In addition, LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial memory as demonstrated by minimizing the ischemia-induced reduction in time spent in the quadrant of the former platform position during the probe trial. Staurosporine had no influence on the ischemia-induced behavioural changes. Histological examination revealed neuronal damage in the hippocampus and in the striatum in all of the ischemic rats. However, treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the hippocampal damage. Correlation analysis demonstrated a correlation between hippocampal damage and total swim distance (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). No correlation was found between hippocampal damage and quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.24, p > 0.1). No correlation was observed between striatal damage and either total swim distance of the escape trials (r = 0.28. p > 0.1) or quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.08, p > 0.6). It is concluded that a correlation exists between hippocampal damage and the deficit in spatial learning following global cerebral ischemia.", 
    "48": "This study was designed to investigate the influence of the calcium (Ca2+) channel inhibitors nicardipine, nifedipine, and flunarizine on the protective action of MK-801, LY 235959 [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists], and GYKI 52466 (a non-NMDA receptor antagonist) against electroconvulsions in mice. Unlike nicardipine (15 mg/kg) or flunarizine (10 mg/kg) nifedipine (7.5 and 15 mg/kg) potentiated the protective potency of MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg), as reflected by significant elevation of the convulsive threshold (a CS50 value of the current strength in mA producing tonic hind limb extension in 50% of the animals). The protective activity of LY 235959 and GYKI 52466 was reflected by their ED50 values in mg/kg, at which the drugs were expected to protect 50% of mice against maximal electroshock-induced tonic extension of the hind limbs. Nicardipine (3.75 15 mg/kg), nifedipine (0.94-15 mg/kg), and flunarizine (2.5-10 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner markedly potentiated the antiseizure efficacy of LY 235959. Flunarizine (5 and 10 mg/kg) was the only Ca2+ channel inhibitor to enhance the protective action of GYKI 52466 against electroconvulsions. Except with MK-801 + flunarizine (motor performance) or GYKI 52466 + flunarizine (long-term memory), combination of NMDA or non-NMDA receptor antagonists with Ca2+ channel inhibitors produced an impairment of motor performance (evaluated in the chimney test) and long-term memory acquisition (measured in the passive avoidance task) as compared with vehicle treatment.", 
    "49": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are the most widely prescribed class of psychoactive drugs in current therapeutic use, despite the important unwanted side-effects that they produce such as sedation, myorelaxation, ataxia, amnesia, ethanol and barbiturate potentiation and tolerance. Searching for safer BDZ-receptor (BDZ-R) ligands we have recently demonstrated the existence of a new family of ligands which have a flavonoid structure. First isolated from plants used as tranquilizers in folkloric medicine, some natural flavonoids have shown to possess a selective and relatively mild affinity for BDZ-Rs and a pharmacological profile compatible with a partial agonistic action. In a logical extension of this discovery various synthetic derivatives of those compounds, such as 6,3'-dinitroflavone were found to have a very potent anxiolytic effect not associated with myorelaxant, amnestic or sedative actions. This dinitro compound, in particular, exhibits a high affinity for the BDZ-Rs (Ki = 12-30 nM). Due to their selective pharmacological profile and low intrinsic efficacy at the BDZ-Rs, flavonoid derivatives, such as those described, could represent an improved therapeutic tool in the treatment of anxiety. In addition, several flavone derivatives may provide important leads for the development of potent and selective BDZ-Rs ligands.", 
    "50": "Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine effective in antiepileptic therapy of children and adults. Presently it is mainly used as adjuvant therapy for intractable seizures. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of clobazam on the apparent clearance of other antiepileptic drugs at steady state, and to determine the factors that determine the plasma levels of clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam. Patients were 74 children with intractable seizures who received treatment with clobazam at our institution as part of the Canadian Cooperative Clobazam Study Group during the years 1987 to 1991. Serum concentrations of clobazam, N-desmethylclobazam, and of concomitant antiepileptic drugs were monitored and prospectively collected. The effect of clobazam treatment on the apparent clearance steady state of the other antiepileptic drugs was determined by statistical comparison of the clearances of each drug before and after initiation of clobazam treatment using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. The effects of dosage, age, and concomitant antiepileptic therapy on the levels of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam was assessed by multivariate analysis. Response to treatment and incidence of adverse effects were evaluated for each conventional antiepileptic drug to possibly identify favorable or unfavorable combinations with clobazam. Whereas the clearances of most conventional antiepileptics are not affected by cotherapy with clobazam, the apparent clearances of valproic acid and primidone are significantly reduced in the presence of clobazam. Serum concentrations of clobazam increased with dosage and age, and decreased with phenobarbital cotherapy. Serum concentrations of N-desmethylclobazam significantly correlated with clobazam serum levels, age, or clobazam dosage and were significantly increased by cotherapy with phenytoin or carbamazepine. None of the concomitantly used drugs were associated with increased or decreased rate of seizure control. Twelve patients experienced mild adverse drug effects that were not associated with particular cotherapy, clobazam dose, or plasma concentrations. When clobazam is added to a therapy regimen that includes valproic acid, the patient should be closely followed for possible adverse drug reactions caused by elevated valproic acid serum concentrations, and monitoring of valproate serum levels should be considered. When clobazam doses are gradually increased to achieve an optimal clinical effect, the interactions with phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin do not necessitate therapeutic drug monitoring of clobazam or N-desmethylclobazam, because there is a large therapeutic window and a poor correlation between plasma concentrations and therapeutic efficacy.",

YM022 inhibited the binding of [(125)I]CCK-8 and [(3)H]devazepide to canine gastrin/CCK-B and CCK-A receptors, with IC50 values of 0.73 and 136 nM, respectively. Intravenous YM022 dose-dependently inhibited pentagastrin- and peptone meal-induced acid secretion with ED50 values of 0.0261 and 0.0654 micromol/kg, respectively, without affecting histamine- or methacholine-induced acid secretion. Famotidine inhibited acid secretion induced by all stimulants, while atropine inhibited the acid secretion induced by every stimulant except histamine. These results indicated that YM022 is a highly potent and selective antagonist for the canine gastrin/CCK-B receptor and suppressed pentagastrin- and peptone meal-induced gastric acid secretion without affecting histamine- or methacholine-induced acid secretion in Heidenhain pouch dogs.", 
    "58": "Traditional methods of preclinical screening have predicted the effects of a putative antiepileptic drug (AED) against human absence seizures by testing its efficacy against clonic seizures in the high-dose pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) model. This high-dose PTZ model correctly predicted the efficacy of ethosuximide (ESM), benzodiazepines, and valproate (VPA) and the lack of efficacy of phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ). However, the high-dose PTZ model erred in predictions for (a) phenobarbital (PB) (PTZ: efficacy; human: nonefficacy); (b) lamotrigine (LTG) (PTZ: nonefficacy; human: efficacy); (c) vigabatrin (VGB) (PTZ: nonefficacy; human: proabsence effect); and (d) tiagabine (TGB) (PTZ: efficacy; human: possible proabsence). It also appears to have erred in predictions for gabapentin (GBP) (PTZ: efficacy) and topiramate (TPM) (PTZ: efficacy). Because the lh/lh genetic model of absence seizures correctly predicted effects of ESM, clonazepam, VPA, PHT, CBZ, and PB against human absence seizures, we performed this study to test the predictive utility of the lh/lh model for LTG, VGB, TGB, GBP, and TPM.",

    "62": "The relationship between the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam and dose and the relationship between the concentration of alprazolam and psychomotor performance in healthy male volunteers were investigated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, modified crossover study. Twenty-four volunteers received placebo in Phase I and then received single 2-mg, 4-mg, 8-mg, and 10-mg doses of a sustained-release formulation in Phases II through V, according to, a crossover design. Blood samples were collected at several times throughout each phase to 48 hours after the dose; the harvested plasma was assayed for concentrations of alprazolam, 4-hydroxyalprazolam, and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam by high-performance liquid chromatography. Sedation was rated at each blood-sampling time and psychomotor performance tests, consisting of digit-symbol substitution and card-sorting tasks, were conducted at several times after each dose. Area under the concentration-time curve and peak concentration for alprazolam increased proportionally with each higher dose; clearance did not differ significantly between treatments. The concentrations of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam increased proportionally with dose and the combined plasma concentration of the metabolites were less than 15% of unchanged concentrations of alprazolam for all doses. Maximum sedation increased with each increase in dose up to 8 mg, and psychomotor performance decreased with each increase in dose. Performance versus concentration curves for alprazolam exhibited a clockwise hysteresis loop in contrast to the counterclockwise hystereses previously reported for both intravenous and oral doses of immediate-release tablets. Data through 6 hours after dose were well described by a sigmoid Emax model. Alprazolam exhibits linear pharmacokinetics after single oral doses of sustained-release tablets between 2 mg and 10 mg. Reversal of the concentration-effect curve to a clockwise loop suggests the counterclockwise hystereses of rapidly absorbed doses was caused by the differing distribution rates into the systemic circulation and effect site and not by metabolite activity.",

He recovered uneventfully, and after the scheduled surgery he resumed his regular practice of taking 6 mg melatonin with prescription sedative drugs. Although melatonin is not regulated as a drug, it may interact with benzodiazepines, be antagonized by naloxone and flumazenil, and interact with melatonin receptors in the central nervous system and elsewhere in the body.

    "68": "Cultured rat hippocampal neurons previously exposed to a media containing no added Mg2+ for 3 h begin to spontaneously trigger recurrent epileptiform discharges following return to normal medium, and this altered population epileptiform activity persisted for the life of the neurons in culture (> 2 wk). Neurons in \"epileptic\" cultures appeared similar in somatic and dendritic morphology and cellular density to control, untreated cultures. In patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal pyramidal cells from \"epileptic,\" low Mg2+ pretreated hippocampal cultures, a rapid (within 2 h of treatment), permanent (lasting > or = 8 days) and statistically significant 50-65% reduction in the current density of functional gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptors was evident when the GABA responses of these cells were compared with control neurons. Functional GABA receptor current density was calculated by determining the maximal response of a cell to GABA 1 mM application and normalizing this response to cellular capacitance. Despite the marked GABA efficacy differences noted above, the potency of GABA in activating chloride currents was not significantly different when the responses to control and \"epileptic\" pyramidal cells to multiple concentrations of GABA were compared. The EC50 for GABA was 4.5 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE) for control neurons and 3.5 +/- 0.4 microM, 5.2 +/- 0.5 microM, 3.7 +/- 0.3 microM, and 4.6 +/- 0.3 microM for epileptic neurons 2 h, 2 days, 3 days, and 8 days after low Mg2+ pretreatment, respectively. Modulation of GABA responses by the benzodiazepine, clonazepam, was significantly reduced in epileptic neurons compared with controls. The kinetically determined clonazepam 100 nM GABA augmentation efficacy decreased from 44.1% in control neurons to 9.3% augmentation in neurons recorded from cultures 10 days posttreatment. The kinetics of GABA current block by the noncompetitive antagonist picrotoxin were determined in hippocampal cultured neurons, and an IC50 of 14 microM determined. Bath application of picrotoxin at half of the IC50 concentration (7 microM) induced epileptiform activity in control cultures and this activity appeared very similar to the epileptiform activity induced by prior low Mg2+ treatment. This concentration of picrotoxin was determined experimentally to block 30% of the GABA(A)-mediated receptor responses in these cultures, and this level of block was sufficient to trigger spontaneous epileptiform activity. The 50% reduction of GABA responses induced as a permanent consequence of low Mg2+ treatment therefore was determined to be sufficient in and of itself to induce the spontaneous epileptiform activity, which was also a consequence of this treatment.", 
    "69": "Alterations in GABAergic function associated with the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were examined with the use of patch-clamp recording techniques in dentate granule (DG) and CA1 neurons acutely isolated from control and spontaneously epileptic rats in which TLE was elicited by pilocarpine injection 3-17 wk before use. The maximal efficacy of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in activating whole cell GABA currents increased significantly in epileptic DG neurons relative to controls. This efficacy increase was due to a 78% enhancement in the functional capacitance-normalized GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) current density in epileptic DG neurons. Increased DG GABA(A)R current density was not accompanied by alterations in GABA potency (EC50). However, the maximal sensitivity of DG GABA-evoked currents to blockade by zinc increased 190% in epileptic neurons. Augmentation of epileptic DG neuron GABA-evoked currents by the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant benzodiazepine clonazepam (100 nM) was enhanced 114% relative to controls, whereas augmentation by the benzodiazepine, (BZ1)-selective agonist zolpidem (100 nM) was decreased by 66%. In contrast to DG neurons, maximal efficacy of GABA in activating GABA currents decreased in epileptic CA1 neurons relative to controls, due to a 52% decrease in functional capacitance-normalized GABA(A)R current density. This altered efficacy of GABA was accompanied by an increased GABA potency (GABA EC50 was 35.8 and 24.5 microM in control and epileptic neurons, respectively). Sensitivity of GABA-evoked currents to blockade by zinc was unchanged in epileptic CA1 neurons, whereas clonazepam (100 nM) augmentation of CA1 GABA-evoked currents decreased 81% relative to controls. These regionally distinct epilepsy-associated modifications in hippocampal GABAergic function may be due to discrete structural alterations in postsynaptic GABA(A)Rs accompanying epileptogenesis, could be therapeutically important, and undoubtedly could contribute to the enhanced limbic excitability underlying TLE.", 
    "70": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder with an estimated prevalence of between 1% and 5%. The symptomatology is characterized by unpleasant sensations experienced predominantly in the legs and rarely in the arms. The symptoms occur only at rest and become more pronounced in the evening or at night. In addition, the patients suffer from a strong urge to move the limbs, typically manifest as walking around, which leads to complete but only temporary relief of the symptoms. Most of the patients with RLS have periodic leg movements (PLMS) during sleep and relaxed wakefulness that are characterized by repetitive flexions of the extremities. PLMS can occur as an isolated phenomenon, but often they occur together with other sleep disorders including RLS, narcolepsy, sleep apnoea syndrome or REM sleep behaviour disorder. In all these disorders, PLMS, contribute considerably to disturbed sleep, as the movements may lead to brief arousals or repeated full awakenings. The aetiology of RLS and PLMS is unknown. It is hypothesized that periodic leg movements result from a suprasegmental disinhibition of descending inhibitory pathways. Based on the efficacy of the drugs listed below, the dopaminergic, adrenergic and opiate systems are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of RLS/PLMS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Studies on the pharmacological treatment of RLS have shown the efficacy of levodopa, dopamine agonists, benzodiazepines, opioids, clonidine and carbamazepine. With regard to the drug treatment of PLMS in other sleep disorders including their isolated occurrence, indications and efficacy have been poorly defined until now.", 
    "71": "Both published and unpublished data concerning the rebound, withdrawal, dependence and abuse potential of zopiclone have been reviewed. As expected for an hypnotic drug of about 5 h elimination half-life, rebound has occasionally been detected but is substantially less frequent than with equivalent benzodiazepines. Tolerance to zopiclone does not occur regularly and cross-tolerance to the benzodiazepines may help in a regimen to withdraw from the latter drugs. Dependence on long-term use, as shown by either a characteristic withdrawal syndrome or by psychological craving, is rare considering the world-wide extent of usage. Abuse (addictive non-medical use) is documented but is also rare, in comparison with the widely abused benzodiazepines. It is concluded that zopiclone has substantial advantages over the benzodiazepines in terms of dependence and abuse potential.", 
    "72": "The time course for distribution of five compounds (caffeine, tolbutamide, phenytoin, ondansetron, and diazepam) was studied in precision-cut rat liver slices. Transport of these compounds differed greatly, with caffeine being distributed rapidly, but not accumulating above the media concentration. Although tolbutamide similarly was not accumulated within the tissue, its uptake rate was slower. The rate of phenytoin, ondansetron, and diazepam distribution (with appropriate corrections for metabolism) was slower still; yet, these drugs were accumulated within the cells of the slice to a concentration approximately 15-fold that of the media. Examination of the physicochemical properties of these compounds demonstrated that the extent of accumulation positively correlated with lipophilicity, whereas the rate of uptake was not statistically correlated with log D. The extent of accumulation within the slice was assessed by an apparent volume of distribution parameter (ranging from 26 to 195 microliters/slice). Using cell:media partition coefficients determined in hepatocytes and the intra- and extracellular spaces within the slice (as measured with the markers tritiated water and sucrose), it was possible to predict apparent volumes of distribution for each drug in the liver slice. Comparison of observed and predicted apparent volumes of distribution gave ratios of 0.34-1. Intrinsic clearance values for these five drugs are available for slices and cells (slice: cell intrinsic clearance ratios 0.05-0.43; Worboys et al., Drug Metab. Dispos. 24, 676-681, 1996). Drugs that demonstrate low intrinsic clearance ratios also have low apparent volume ratios, thus indicating that reduced drug uptake and clearance in slices, relative to hepatocytes, are interdependent. Both phenomena may be rationalized by the existence of a drug concentration gradient within the slice. At very high drug concentrations, Vmax operates, and the consequence of the gradient is minimal. Therefore, it is possible to speculate upon the fraction of hepatocytes within the slice contributing to clearance by considering Vmax values. For six pathways of metabolism, Vmax in slices averages 35% of the corresponding parameter in isolated hepatocytes. This is most likely due to limited oxygen and compromised metabolic function of the core cells. These distribution phenomena severely complicate the possibility of using a scaling factor based on the theoretical number of slices obtainable from a liver to predict in vivo intrinsic clearance.", 
    "73": "An estimated 1 in 4 women in the United States will be raped in their lifetimes. Approximately 75% of all rapes are date or acquaintance rapes. Recently the illegal use of flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), a benzodiazepine, as a prelude to the assault has been reported. Flunitrazepam readily dissolves, and once in solution, is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. The predominant clinical manifestations are drowsiness, impaired motor skills, and anterograde amnesia. Due to the amnestic effects of flunitrazepam, historical clues of the rape event are difficult to obtain. Patients with a complaint of sexual assault who appear intoxicated or have anterograde amnesia should be suspected of unknowingly ingesting flunitrazepam. In addition to adhering to standard rape protocols, a urine specimen should be analyzed for flunitrazepam metabolites using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. If the hospital, local, or forensic laboratory is unable to analyze for flunitrazepam, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the manufacturer of Rohypnol, should be contacted. Hoffmann-La Roche has a mechanism for definitive testing for flunitrazepam, at no cost, for health care providers, rape treatment centers, and law enforcement agencies.

Block of CCK(B) receptors 30 min before and after cat exposure prevented increases in ALB assessed 1 week later in the elevated plus maze. Blocks of CCK(A) receptors either before or after cat exposure were without effect on increases in ALB measured 1 week later. Changes in activity or exploration could not account for the results. Effects of cat exposure on ALB, startle, and corticosteroid levels have been proposed as a model of affective disorder in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Implications of these findings for mechanisms of initiation of anxiety in PTSD and posttrauma pharmacological prophylaxis in PTSD are discussed.", 
    "79": "The authors (within 24 hours of the order) administered a telephone questionnaire to physicians prescribing benzodiazepines to patients over age 65 admitted to a tertiary care university hospital (N = 81 consecutive medical and surgical admissions). Data were obtained from 50 physicians. Prescriptions were most commonly written for preoperative relaxation (26%), pain (14%), nausea (12%), to aid intubation (12%), or facilitate a medical test (10%). Dosages were chosen on the basis of subjective experience (32%), lowest effective dose (28%), considerations of age/sex/weight (16%), and drug manual recommendations (8%). Ten percent of patients were prescribed a benzodiazepine before hospitalization, and their dosages were tapered (6%) or maintained (4%). There is considerable variation in physicians rationale for benzodiazepine prescriptions to hospitalized elderly patients. Benzodiazepines are used to treat symptoms rather than disorders. Age is infrequently considered in dosing judgments despite the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes known to be associated with aging.", 
    "80": "Neurotoxin (AMPA)-induced lesions in the caudate nucleus as well as unilateral surgical transection of the striato-nigral pathway strongly depleted the binding of a homophthalazine (formerly called 2,3-benzodiazepines) girisopam (GYKI-51189, EGIS 5810) selectively in the substantia nigra of the rat, ipsilateral to the lesions. In contrast to this, AMPA injections into the substantia nigra failed to effect on girisopam binding to either components of the nigro-striatal system. Data indicate that this homophthalazine may bind to a descending component of the striatum (striato-nigral projecting neurons), or its binding capacity to substantia nigra neurons depends on the integrity of striatal afferent pathways to the substantia nigra.", 
    "81": "The bispectral index (BIS), a value derived from the electroencephalograph (EEG), has been proposed as a measure of anesthetic effect. To establish its utility for this purpose, it is important to determine the relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, and increasing levels of sedation. This study was designed to evaluate this relation for four commonly used anesthetic drugs: propofol, midazolam, isoflurane, and alfentanil.", 
    "82": "Seventy-two consenting volunteers were studied at four institutions. Volunteers were given either isoflurane, propofol, midazolam, or alfentanil. Each volunteer was administered a dose-ranging sequence of one of the study drugs to achieve predetermined target concentrations. A frontal montage was used for continuous recording of the EEG. At each pseudo-steady-state drug concentration, a BIS score was recorded, the participant was shown either a picture or given a word to recall, an arterial blood sample was obtained for subsequent analysis of drug concentration, and the participant was evaluated for level of sedation as determined by the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of the alertness/ sedation scale (OAAS). An OAAS score of 2 or less was considered unconscious. The BIS (version 2.5) score was recorded in real-time and the BIS (version 3.0) was subsequently derived off-line from the recorded raw EEG data. The relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, responsiveness score, and presence or absence of recall was determined by linear and logistic regression for both the individual drugs and, when appropriate, for the pooled results. The prediction probability was also calculated.", 
    "83": "The BIS score (r = 0.883) correlated significantly better than the measured propofol concentration (r = -0.778; P < 0.05) with the responsiveness score. The BIS provided as effective correlation with responsiveness score of the OAAS as did the measured concentration for midazolam and isoflurane. None of the volunteers given alfentanil lost consciousness and thus were excluded from the pooled analysis. The pooled BIS values at which 50% and 95% of participants were unconscious were 67 and 50, respectively. The prediction probability values for BIS ranged from 0.885-0.976, indicating a very high predictive performance for correctly indicating probability of loss of consciousness.", 
    "84": "The BIS both correlated well with the level of responsiveness and provided an excellent prediction of the loss of consciousness. These results imply that BIS may be a valuable monitor of the level of sedation and loss of consciousness for propofol, midazolam, and isoflurane.", 
    "85": "Little information is available regarding the use of patient-controlled sedation (PCS) among the elderly. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of propofol PCS among elderly patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty.", 
    "86": "Forty patients, aged 65-78 yr, undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty under regional anaesthesia were randomized to receive propofol PCS (dose = 0.3 mg.kg-1, delay = three min; n = 20) or anaesthetist-administered midazolam-fentanyl sedation (n = 20). Sedation, anxiety and discomfort visual analogue scores (VAS) were measured, by an independent observer, preoperatively, immediately at the end of surgery and one hour following admission to the postanaesthetic care unit (PACU). Cognition was evaluated, using an abbreviated Mini Mental Status Examination, preoperatively and in the PACU. Patient satisfaction, based on VAS and a brief questionnaire, was measured in the PACU. The incidence of intraoperative complications was also compared.", 
    "87": "Patient satisfaction was high in each group. Sedation and anxiety VAS were similar in each group. A high incidence of pain with drug injection was noted among patients receiving propofol (80%). Transient deeper levels of sedation (6 vs 1; P = 0.05) were observed more commonly in the propofol PCS group.", 
    "88": "Propofol PCS provides effective sedation. Using a propofol dose of 0.3 mg.kg-1, transient episodes of deeper sedation were noted more frequently among patients receiving PCS. These episodes did not require intervention but, suggest that this propofol PCS dose approaches the limit of safety and should be further reduced for some elderly patients.",

Group 1A received portal injections (10 ml lidocaine 1%), intraarticular lidocaine (20 ml CO2 lidocaine 2% with 1/200,000 adrenaline) and a placebo femoral nerve block (20 ml saline). Group FNB received a femoral 3-in-1 nerve block (20 ml chloroprocaine 2% with 1/200,000 adrenaline), placebo portal injections (10 ml saline) and placebo intraarticular saline (20 ml saline with 1/200,000 adrenaline). Group FNB + IA received a femoral 3-in-1 nerve block, intraarticular lidocaine and placebo portal injections. The following were assessed: intraoperative pain (10 cm VAS: 0 = no pain, 10 = extreme pain), surgical operating conditions (1 = excellent, 4 = unacceptable), intraoperative use of sedation and analgesia, time to discharge, patient satisfaction score (1 = very satisfied, 5 very unsatisfied) and postoperative analgesia. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi-square tests as appropriate, P < 0.05 was considered significant.",

    "93": "The effect of vagally and acetylcholine (ACh)-induced bronchoconstrictions was assessed by an increase in the slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptor (SAR) activity during both inflation and deflation and the rise in total lung resistance (R(L)). Those responses were compared before and after pirenzepine (PZ, M1 selective) with or without propranolol (a beta adrenoreceptor blocker), gallamine (M2 selective), 4-DAMP (M3 selective), hexamethonium (C6, a ganglion blocker) and atropine (a nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist). The SAR activity was recorded from the cut left vagus nerve, whereas the right vagus nerve was cut and stimulated electrically. Experiments were performed in anesthetized, artificially ventilated rabbits. Vagal stimulation (5-20 Hz, 13 V, 0.2 msec) for 30 sec and ACh injection (1 and 3 microg/kg) caused bronchoconstriction in a frequency- and dose-dependent manner. At the treatment with PZ (3-30 microg/kg) in both propranolol-untreated and -treated animals, vagally mediated bronchoconstriction was blocked by this M1 receptor blocker at 10 microg/kg, whereas ACh-induced bronchoconstriction was not significantly altered by any dose of PZ. Gallamine (3-30 microg/kg) had no significant effect on vagally and ACh-induced bronchoconstrictions, which were completely blocked by atropine (2 mg/kg). Three micrograms of 4-DAMP augmented the SAR and R(L) responses to vagal stimulation but inhibited those responses to ACh injection. 4-DAMP at 10 to 30 microg/kg dose-dependently inhibited both vagally and ACh-induced bronchoconstrictions. C6 (20 mg/kg) abolished vagally mediated bronchoconstriction but had no significant effect on ACh-induced bronchoconstriction. These results suggest that M1 receptors function as the excitatory receptors in the rabbit airway.", 
    "94": "Muscarinic receptors in the spinal cord have been shown to mediate antinociception and alter blood pressure. Currently, there is much interest in identifying which muscarinic receptor subtypes regulate these functions. Toward that end, this study aimed to identify and localize the muscarinic receptor subtypes present in spinal cord using in vitro receptor autoradiography with [3H]-pirenzepine and [3H]-N-methylscopolamine. The results showed that M2 binding sites were distributed throughout the dorsal and ventral horns, whereas M3 binding sites were localized to laminae I to III of the dorsal horn. Only background levels of M1 binding sites were detected. Saturation binding assays using [3H]-pirenzepine in spinal cord homogenates confirmed the absence of M1 receptors. Competition membrane receptor assays using [3H]-N-methylscopolamine and the unlabeled antagonists pirenzepine, 11-2[(-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)-acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro 6H-pyrido(2, 3-b)(1, 4) benzodiazepine-one, methoctramine, and methoctramine in combination with atropine corroborated the autoradiographic findings and also revealed the presence of M4 binding sites. The finding that M2 and M3 binding sites were localized to the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn where nociceptive A delta and C fibers terminate suggests the possibility that either or both of these muscarinic receptor subtypes modulate antinociception. The present demonstration of M4 binding sites in spinal cord is consistent with the possibility that M2 and/or M4 receptors are involved in the regulation of blood pressure at the spinal level.", 
    "95": "The effects of RB101, a complete inhibitor of enkephalin-catabolizing enzymes, alone or with a selective cholecystokinin (CCK)B receptor antagonist (CI988) or CCK(A) receptor antagonist (devazepide), on carrageenin-induced spinal c-Fos expression were investigated. Spinal c-Fos expression was observed 90 min after intraplantar carrageenin (6 mg/150 microl saline), with Fos-like-immunoreactive neurons preferentially located in the superficial laminae of the spinal dorsal horn. Intravenous RB101 (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced the number of superficial Fos-like-immunoreactive neurons (r2 = 0.739, P < .0001), with 63 +/- 2% (P < .0001) reduction for the highest dose. These effects were completely blocked by coadministered naloxone. Coadministration of inactive doses of i.v. RB101 (5 mg/kg) and i.p. CI988 (3 mg/kg) significantly and strongly reduced the number of carrageenin-induced, superficial, Fos-like-immunoreactive neurons (55 +/- 5% reduction of control carrageenin c-Fos expression, P < .0001). This effect was blocked by coadministered naloxone. It is important to note that coadministered RB101 and devazepide did not influence spinal c-Fos expression. None of the various drug combinations influenced the carrageenin-induced peripheral edema. These results show that RB101 dose-dependently decreases carrageenin-evoked spinal c-Fos expression. In addition, the effectiveness of RB101 can be revealed by preadministration of the CCK(B) receptor antagonist CI988. Considering the weak opioid side effects obtained with RB101 treatment and the strong increase of its effects by the CCK(B) receptor antagonist, this type of drug combination could have promising therapeutic application in the management of pain in humans.",

    "101": "Twelve nonsmoking healthy subjects (average age = 70.4 years (66-76 years)) participated. The anterior tibalis muscle latency increased in response to a sudden perturbation with diazepam compared with placebo (TA latency 149 ms vs 142 ms, P < .001). Neurocognitive tests were adversely affected for 90 minutes after diazepam administration compared with placebo (P < .05). Other measures did not demonstrate significant effect of diazepam.", 
    "102": "This is among the first reports showing that benzodiazepines affect neuromuscular processing related to balance control. Increased muscle latency to sudden perturbations may represent an effect of diazepam upon the oligosynaptic spinal reflex distinct from the sedation. Surface electromyography may be a valuable noninvasive tool for future studies of drug effect on balance and falls risk among older people.", 
    "103": "This study investigates changes of jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjO2) measured by fiberoptic jugular bulb oximetry and changes of intracranial hemodynamics using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 17 ASA III patients. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, midazolam, and continuous infusion of etomidate. Hypothermic CPB (27 degrees C) was managed according to alpha-stat conditions. SjO2 (%) was measured by a fiberoptic catheter (Opticath F 5.5; Abbott Critical Care Systems) placed in the right jugular bulb via the right internal jugular vein. Mean blood flow velocity (Vmean, cm/s) was measured in the middle cerebral artery using a bidirectional 2-MHz TCD system (Transpect, Medasonics). Data were recorded continuously from the beginning to the end of the CPB. During cooling and hypothermia (27 degrees C); SjO2 and Vmean did not change compared with values at the start of CPB. However, with the beginning of rewarming, Vmean was increased 65% compared with stable hypothermia (27 degrees C). This increase in Vmean was associated with a 25% decrease in SjO2. Maximum desaturation occurred at a 36 degrees C jugular bulb temperature. During cooling and stable hypothermia, global oxygen balance and intracerebral perfusion seemed to be maintained. However, a major alteration in the balance of the cerebral oxygen supply and demand may occur in response to rewarming despite increases in Vmean. Findings suggest inadequate increases in CBF to meet cerebral metabolic demand. Further investigations need to validate these findings with biochemical techniques and neuropsychological tests.", 
    "104": "This study examined rebound insomnia after discontinuation of chronic use of zolpidem (10 mg), a short elimination half-life imidazopyridine. The zolpidem group was bracketed by a placebo group and a positive control group taking 0.5 mg of triazolam (twice the recommended dose), which is known to produce rebound insomnia. Ninety-nine patients with sleep complaints that were polysomnographically documented participated in the study. After randomization, patients completed a 2-night, single-blind, placebo baseline period, a 28-night double-blind treatment phase, and a 3-night, single-blind, placebo substitution period. Polysomnographic and subjective sleep variables indicated a lack of rebound insomnia for the zolpidem group. The positive triazolam control group had rebound insomnia only on the first discontinuation night. There was no significant correlation between rebound insomnia and the level of initial insomnia, the degree of response to treatment in week 4, or the amount of tolerance that developed during drug use. During the 4-week treatment period, efficacy diminished for both drugs. From these data, it cannot be determined whether the lack of rebound insomnia with zolpidem is a result of drug dose or some property of the drug such as receptor selectivity.", 
    "105": "GABA modulates dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens and corpus striatum. Using in vivo microdialysis techniques we examined this modulatory role and the extent to which three different GABAergic drugs can attenuate cocaine's ability to increase extracellular dopamine concentrations and gross locomotor activity. Ethanol, lorazepam (Ativan), and gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG) significantly and dose-dependently attenuated cocaine-induced dopamine release in the corpus striatum of freely moving animals. Unlike ethanol or lorazepam, however, GVG is not a sedative hypnotic in the doses used, and hence the strategy of selectively increasing GABAergic activity by suicide inhibition of the catabolic enzyme, GABA-transaminase, offers the unique advantage of attenuating cocaine-induced dopamine release without the apparent side effects typically associated with sedative hypnotics.", 
    "106": "Recent studies have underlined the impact of genetic factors in anxiety profiles. In this context, we have initiated a series of experiments aiming to select, among six inbred strains of rats, a pair of strains that contrasts the most in fear-related behaviours measured in the open field, the elevated plus-maze, the black and white box and the social interaction test. Significant interstrain differences were found for all behavioural measures. A factor analysis of all variables produced three independent factors explaining 85.1% of the total variance. Factor 1 had high loadings from variables related to the approach/avoidance towards aversive stimuli (e.g., center of the open field, open arms of the plus-maze and white compartment of the black/white box). Variables related to general activity in novel environments (e.g., total locomotion in the open field and closed-arm entries in the plus-maze) loaded highly on Factor 2. Defecation and time of social interaction loaded positively on Factor 3. To verify whether elevated plus-maze variables loading on Factor 1 were associated to anxiety, the effects of single doses of diazepam and pentylenetetrazole were examined in Lewis and SHR rats, i.e., the most contrasting strains regarding Factor 1. Variables with high loadings on this factor changed in opposite ways in response to diazepam and pentylenetetrazole treatments. This study suggests, thus, that Lewis and SHR strains may constitute a useful model for studying the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the interindividual differences in baseline levels of anxiety.", 
    "107": "We have investigated, through factor analysis, anxiety- and activity-related variables in rats placed in the light/dark box. Thus, vehicle-, diazepam (DZ)-, and chlordiazepoxide (CDP)-treated rats were submitted 30 min later to 5-min light/dark or dark/light tests (initial placements in light or dark, respectively). Following this test, the animals were tested for 5 min in an automated activity monitor. Doses of DZ (0.75-3.0 mg/kg) and CDP (2.5-10.0 mg/kg) were based on preliminary evidence for 1.5 mg/kg of DZ and 5 mg/kg of CDP being anxiolytic in the elevated plus-maze. In the light/dark test, DZ increased the number of visits to and duration in the light compartment, and locomotor activity in the dark compartment; moreover, DZ decreased the latency to enter the light compartment. These effects were, however, significant for the highest dose only. Although CDP yielded similar behavioural effects, only the highest dose had a significant effect, namely, on latency to enter the light side. Conversely, none of the other variables were benzodiazepine-sensitive. Locomotion in the activity cages was decreased by DZ and CDP, an effect significant for the highest doses of benzodiazepines (dark/light test condition only). In both tests, factor analyses revealed an anxiety-related factor (to which all variables related to the visits in the light and part of the locomotion in the dark contributed), and an activity-related factor (upon which the latency to enter the dark and part of the locomotion in the dark loaded) in the light/dark test only. It is suggested that although the light/dark and dark/light tests capture an approach/avoidance dimension, DZ and CDP are more effective in the former test. Compared to the light/dark test, however, the plus-maze may be more sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of DZ and CDP.", 
    "108": "This review examines the most common male sexual dysfunction, premature ejaculation (PE). The prevalence, classification, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and psychological studies that offer evidence useful for understanding and clinically evaluating PE are reviewed. It is proposed that there are two basic kinds of PE: biogenic and psychogenic. Studies reporting pharmacological aspects of ejaculation offer some suggestions regarding the mechanisms of ejaculation as well as possible pharmacologic aid for some premature ejaculators. The traditional assumption among sex therapists that PE is almost universally caused by psychological features, and easily treated with sex therapy behavioral techniques, is drawn into question. Based on the limited available results from systematic investigations, behavioral treatments for PE remain beneficial to only a minority of men three years after treatment ends, suggesting that this male dysfunction is difficult to treat effectively. The mediocre results reported in treatment outcome studies may be due, in part, to reports on heterogeneous groups of premature ejaculators, for whom treatment has been generalized rather than targeted to the specific type of PE. We propose a biological and psychological etiology. With more discriminating assessment and more specific diagnosis of PE, and with treatment designed to address the particular type of PE, long-term outcome should improve for this common sexual dysfunction.",

    "110": "Previously, a double-blind, random-assignment trial of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine (in low, medium, and high dose ranges), placebo, or haloperidol (10-20 mg/day) for 335 schizophrenic inpatients was conducted for up to 52 weeks. Changes in the treatment groups from baseline to endpoint in summary scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and several secondary measures were compared. This article describes a path analysis to determine to what extent the total treatment effect on negative symptoms was direct or indirect (i.e., mediated by differential effects on positive symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, or mood).", 
    "111": "Significantly greater improvement was achieved with high-dose olanzapine than with placebo or haloperidol. Olanzapine had a significantly greater direct effect than placebo on all SANS dimensions except anhedonia-asociality. Olanzapine also demonstrated a significantly greater direct effect than haloperidol on negative symptoms, especially on the dimensions of affective flattening and avolition-apathy. Olanzapine's superior effects were replicated in a subgroup with SANS-defined prominent negative symptoms (N = 116) and a subgroup with a BPRS-defined cross-sectional proxy for the deficit state (N = 117).", 
    "112": "These results suggest that the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are directly responsive to treatment. The significantly greater direct and indirect effects of olanzapine than of haloperidol on negative symptoms are likely related to olanzapine's pleotrophic pharmacology, which includes dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, and adrenergic activities. The results contribute to the hypothesis that negative symptoms may be under the influence of several neurotransmitters within one or more neuroanatomic circuits.",

Olanzapine was also associated with significantly fewer discontinuations of treatment due to lack of drug efficacy or adverse events. Substantially more olanzapine-treated patients (66.5%) than haloperidol-treated patients (46.8%) completed 6 weeks of therapy. Statistically significant advantages of olanzapine treatment were related to 1) change in negative symptoms, 2) extrapyramidal symptom profile, 3) effect on prolactin levels, and 4) response rate.",

    "117": "The present study was carried out to examine the effects of submucosal administration of endothelin on gastric mucosal integrity in rats. Injection of endothelin-3 into the submucosal space of the stomach induced gastric mucosal damage dose-dependently and site-specifically. The gastric injury was localized only at the injected site and the mucosal damage was associated with hemorrhage. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations revealed that mucosal injury had developed 15 min after endothelin application. Submucosal injection of either adrenalin or noradrenalin also induced gastric mucosal damage, but produced multiple gastric mucosal lesions; i.e., the macroscopic appearance of endothelin-induced gastric lesions differed from those produced by catecholamines. The endothelin-induced mucosal lesions were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with either atropine, pirenzepine, or ranitidine; or by vagotomy. In addition, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, significantly enhanced the formation of gastric mucosal lesions. Thus, it appears that nitric oxide synthesis, possibly induced by endothelin, may play a role as an antiulcer mechanism in endothelin-induced gastric mucosal damage. Vagotomy and anti-cholinergic or anti-secretory treatment significantly attenuated the severity of the mucosal lesions, suggesting that vagal cholinergic pathways and acid secretion may influence the development of the gastric mucosal damage induced by endothelin-3. These results suggest that endothelin-3 may play an important role in the development of gastric ulceration; the submucosal application of endothelin-3 in the gastric mucosa may be a useful experimental model for investigating acute gastric mucosal ulceration.", 
    "118": "The native TRH receptor (TRH-R), which is a G protein-coupled receptor that signals via the phosphoinositide transduction pathway, has been assumed to be inactive in the absence of agonist. In contrast, a mutant mouse TRH-R (C335Stop TRH-R) was shown previously to exhibit constitutive (or agonist-independent) signaling activity. In this report, we measured signaling activity of TRH-Rs using a protein kinase C-responsive reporter gene instead of formation of inositol phosphate second messenger molecules. Using this more sensitive system, we show that native mouse TRH-Rs exhibit agonist-independent signaling activity that is directly proportional to the number of receptors expressed in COS-1 cells and is inhibited by negative antagonist benzodiazepine drugs. As expected, the basal signaling activity of native TRH-Rs is lower than C335Stop TRH-Rs. Constitutive activity of native TRH-Rs is not peculiar to COS-1 cells in which receptor density is markedly elevated, because it can also be demonstrated in Madin Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing mouse TRH-Rs and GH4C1 cells endogenously expressing rat TRH-Rs. These findings support the thesis that native TRH-Rs oscillate between active and inactive states. We suggest that demonstration of constitutive activity of native receptors may depend on the sensitivity of the signaling assay employed.", 
    "119": "The effect of pregnancy and lactation on GABA(A) receptor and central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (CBR and PBR, respectively) was studied in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Pregnancy was associated with increased CBR density (on day 19) in the hippocampus and with decreased [3H]Ro 15-1788-specific binding in the hypothalamus during pregnancy and lactation. A similar decrease in [3H]PK 11195-specific binding was observed in the hypothalamus and pituitary. An increase in PBR density in the ovary and uterus was observed during pregnancy, while adrenal PBR density was down-regulated during pregnancy and lactation. It seems that the hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy and lactation play a role in the regulation of CBR and PBR in discrete tissues.", 
    "120": "The response to i.v. administration of bicuculline and its interaction with the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam and antagonist flumazenil were studied in male and female handling stressed and swim stressed rats. Both handling stressed and swim stressed male rats needed less bicuculline to produce myoclonic twitch and running/bouncing (RB) clonus than females. Besides, a lower dose of bicuculline produced tonic hindlimb extensor convulsion (THE) in male than in female swim stressed rats. Flumazenil failed to affect seizure thresholds for bicuculline either in handling stressed or in swim stressed animals. Sex differences remained present after diazepam pre-treatment as well. While diazepam enhanced doses of bicuculline producing all three convulsive signs similarly in both handling and swim stressed rats (141-162%), swim stress had the lowest anticonvulsive effect for the onset of myoclonic twitch (110% in males and 117% in females) and the highest for THE (148% in males and 188% in females). The anticonvulsive effect of diazepam was not sex-dependent, while the anticonvulsive effect of swim stress was greater in female than in male rats. The results suggest that greater sensitivity of male rats to bicuculline and the anticonvulsive effect of swim stress do not result from the release of endogenous modulators of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "121": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected (i.p.) with either midazolam (MDZ, 2.0 mg/kg) or vehicle (1.0 ml/kg) 10 min before they were trained on a multiple-trial inhibitory avoidance task. Immediately following the training, bicuculline methiodide (BMI; 2.0, 5.6, 56.0 or 197.0 pmol/0.5 microl) or vehicle (0.5 microl) was infused bilaterally into the amygdala. On a 48 h retention test the performance of the MDZ-treated animals was significantly poorer than that of controls. The retention of MDZ-treated animals given intra-amygdala injections of the lowest dose of BMI (2.0 pmol) was comparable to that of controls, whereas higher doses of BMI impaired retention. The present results are consistent with other findings indicating that the amygdala mediates the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines on aversive learning. Furthermore, these data suggest that benzodiazepines impair memory by disrupting post-training processes underlying memory consolidation.", 
    "122": "The propensity for anxiety-related behavior has been studied by comparing two highly inbred strains of mice, ABP/Le and C57BL/6ByJ, in two behavioral procedures, open-field and light-dark preference. Their Mendelian F2 population allowed us to evaluate the putative involvement of four easily identifiable loci in anxiogenic processes. In fact, chromosomal regions containing the brown, pink-eyed dilution and short-ear loci on the 4th, 7th and 9th chromosomes respectively are associated with anxiety-related behavior patterns. In addition, binding of [3H]flumazenil to brain GABA(A) receptors was measured as a biochemical index that may be associated with observed behavior patterns.", 
    "123": "This study examined the effects of neurosteroids on the behavior of mice in the mirrored chamber test of anxiety, and determined the potential mechanisms by which neurosteroids alter the behavior in animal models of anxiety. Allopregnanolone (AP) (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) and pregnenolone sulfate (PS) (0.5 and 2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the latency to enter the chamber, and increased both number of entries and total time spent in the chamber in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the spontaneous locomotor activity. In contrast, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (1 and 2 mg/kg) increased motor activity and caused an anxiogenic response, i.e., an increase in latency to enter the mirrored chamber, and a decrease in the number of entries and time spent in the chamber. Progesterone (PROG) (1-10 mg/kg), a neurosteroid precursor, and 4'-chlordiazepam (4'-CD) (0.25-1 mg/kg), a specific ligand for the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptor (MDR), produced a clear dose-dependent anxiolytic response in the mirrored chamber. The AP-, PROG- and 4'-CD-elicited anxiolytic behavior was blocked by picrotoxin (1 mg/kg), a GABA-A chloride channel antagonist, but not by flumazenil (2 mg/kg), a selective benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist. In contrast, the anxiolytic effect of PS was not blocked by picrotoxin. The 4'-CD-induced anxiolytic effect was prevented by pretreatment with PK11195 (2 mg/kg), a selective partial MDR antagonist. Nifedipine (2 and 5 mg/kg), a dihydropyridine-type Ca2+ channel blocker, produced a flumazenil-resistant anxiolytic effect. Combined administration of nifedipine (2 and 5 mg/kg) and PS (0.5 and 2 mg/kg) exerted a significant additive effect in the mirrored chamber test. The potent anxiolytic effect of dizocilpine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), an NMDA receptor antagonist, was blocked by pretreatment with DHEAS (2 mg/kg). Neurosteroids evoked changes in mirrored chamber activities resembling those elicited by triazolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg). However, these effects were seen at doses that did not markedly affect locomotor activity, thereby suggesting these changes in behavior represent anxiolytic actions. Together, these results provide evidence for differential behavioral actions of the neurosteroids AP, PS and DHEAS in the mirrored chamber test of anxiety. The anxiolytic effect of PROG may be imputed to its metabolism to neurosteroid AP, while the 4'-CD-induced anxiolytic response is related to its MDR-stimulated neurosteroidogenesis and subsequent modulation of GABA-A receptor. Further, these differential effects reaffirm the contention that neurosteroids could be involved in the homeostasis of stress response.", 
    "124": "The involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in anxiety was investigated in rats, using the elevated plus maze test. Acute, but not chronic, systemic treatment with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 and 60 mg.kg-1), an inhibitor of NO synthase, increased the time spent by the rats in the open arms. Both the acute and chronic treatments with L-NAME inhibited NO synthase in endothelial cells and in the central nervous system, as shown by the increase in mean arterial pressure and decreased NO synthase activity in brain tissue. Chronic treatment with L-NAME also decreased the serum nitrate levels. The anxiolysis induced by acute L-NAME treatment is unlikely to be due to hypertension, since two-kidney one-clip hypertension in non-L-NAME-treated rats failed to significantly change exploratory behaviour in the elevated plus maze. These results indicate that acute inhibition of NO synthesis decreases anxiety in rats.", 
    "125": "Seizures and epilepsy in the elderly are an important and increasingly common clinical problem. Major known causes include cerebrovascular disease, brain tumor, degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and toxic-metabolic syndromes such as nonketotic hyperglycemia, postcardiac arrest, and drug-induced seizures. Recognition of seizures may be complicated by relatively unique clinical presentations and differential diagnosis. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus may present as recurrent episodes of confusion. The electroencephalogram is less useful than in the pediatric age group, but has a role in the evaluation of a first seizure and may rarely show characteristic patterns, such as poststroke periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. Convulsive status, especially that associated with drug toxicity, is associated with increased mortality in the elderly. Pharmacological treatment is complicated by age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Some of the new antiepileptic drugs may offer advantages for use in the elderly. Oxcarbazepine has fewer drug interactions than carbamazepine, and gabapentin has one, a reduction of felbamate renal elimination. Vigabatrin causes little cognitive dysfunction, while drugs that reduce excitatory amino acid neurotransmission, such as lamotrigine and felbamate, have potentially protective effects in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The use of barbiturates, primidone, the benzodiazepine clobazam, and the calcium blockers flunarizine and cinnarizine should preferably be avoided in the elderly.", 
    "126": "To evaluate the utility of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) as a biomarker of neurotoxicity, we measured receptor levels after sub-seizure doses of domoic acid (0-3.0 mg/kg) in rats using [3H]PK-11195 autoradiography. PBR expression in limbic structures was significantly increased 5 days, but not 24 or 48 h after injection of 3.0 mg/kg domoic acid. The largest increase in [3H]PK-11195 binding (> 500% above control) was found in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. Other limbic structures including the CA1 hippocampal subfield, subiculum, dentate gyrus and amygdala also showed significant increases in PBR expression, as did the striatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Smaller but significant increases were also observed 5 days after injection of 1.5 mg/kg, but not in animals treated with 0.75 mg/kg domoic acid. No pathology was observed after routine histological staining of brain tissue. Spatial learning and memory, a process thought to be associated with the hippocampus, was assessed in the Morris water maze. Groups treated with 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg, but not 0.75 mg/kg domoic acid were significantly impaired in water maze performance. These findings suggest that the PBR could provide a sensitive and specific biomarker of neurotoxicity.", 
    "127": "Diazepam-binding inhibitor has been initially isolated from the rat brain from its ability to compete with benzodiazepines for their receptors. We have recently shown that the octadecaneuropeptide (diazepam-binding inhibitor-(33-50) or ODN) induces an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in astroglial cells. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether central-type benzodiazepine receptors or peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the response of cultured rat astrocytes to ODN. The mixed central-/peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand flunitrazepam (10(-10) to 10(-6) M), the specific peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor agonist Ro5-4864 (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) and the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor 'antagonist' PK 11195 (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) all induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i. At high doses (10(-7) to 10(-5) M), the central-type benzodiazepine receptor agonist clonazepam also mimicked the stimulatory effect of ODN on [Ca2+]i. However, the [Ca2+]i rise induced by ODN was blocked neither by PK 11195 nor by the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10(-6) M each). Binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to intact astrocytes was displaced by low concentrations of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands flunitrazepam, Ro5 4864 and PK 11195, and by high concentrations of clonazepam. In contrast, ODN did not compete for [3H]flunitrazepam binding in intact cells. These data indicate that the effect of ODN on Ca2+ mobilization in rat astrocytes is mediated by high affinity receptors which are not related to classical benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "128": "Abrupt termination of the treatment of humans with benzodiazepines (BDZs) leads to a rapid onset of discontinuation syndrome characterized by anxiety, muscle spasms, and occasionally convulsions. For this reason, it is recommended in clinical practice to reduce the dose of the BDZs gradually at the end of treatment. Nevertheless, many clinicians report signs of dependence even during gradual reduction of doses (tapering) of the BDZs in a large proportion of patients. Thus, there is considerable interest in discovering means of weaning patients away from BDZs without the risk of discontinuation syndrome. In the present study, mice withdrawn from chronic treatment with alprazolam showed anxiety, muscle rigidity, and seizures between days 1 and 28 after termination of the treatment. Replacement of alprazolam with the beta-carboline abecarnil for 7 days prevented the occurrence of the signs of dependence. In contrast, substitution of the beta-carboline antagonist ethyl-5-isopropoxy-4-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (ZK93426) for alprazolam worsened the discontinuation syndrome. Replacement therapy with abecarnil after long-term treatment with the BDZs offers a novel method for rapid tapering.",

    "132": "Per capita prescription of methadone tablets for chronic pain in South Australia was the highest in Australia in 1994. A large increase in deaths, due mainly to methadone tablets prescribed for chronic pain, occurred in 1993-1994. Illegal diversion of methadone to non-patients was responsible for half of the deaths during these two years. Deaths from overdoses of methadone syrup prescribed in maintenance therapy for drug dependence declined from 1984 to 1994. The relative risk for patient deaths due to methadone tablets versus methadone syrup was estimated to be 7.29 (95% confidence limits, 2.15-31.48). Psychotropic drug combinations were present in 86% of deaths.", 
    "133": "The methadone syrup program for drug dependence remains relatively safe. Our data raise concerns about prescribing methadone tablets for chronic pain. Better prescriber education and accountability, patient assessment and supervision and advice to patients about concurrent use of alcohol and benzodiazepines are needed.", 
    "134": "In summary, we present a new model for evaluating thermoregulatory effects of drug administration, pregnancy, illness, etc. Specifically, we experimentally manipulated both skin and core temperatures, and subsequently compensated for the changes in skin temperature using the relationships between skin and core contributions to thermoregulatory control. We thus were able to report our results for warm- and cold-responses in terms of calculated core-temperature thresholds at a single designated skin temperature. Advantages of this model include its being nearly noninvasive and requiring relatively little core temperature manipulation. Using this technique, we have shown that the shape and magnitude of thermoregulatory impairment produced by various anesthetic drugs differs. Propofol linearly increases the sweating threshold and linearly decreases the vasoconstriction and shivering threshold. In contrast, volatile anesthetics produce a nonlinear reduction in the major cold-response thresholds, reducing the vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds disproportionately at higher anesthetic concentrations. Midazolam not only produces a different magnitude of thermoregulatory impairment, but also a novel pattern of threshold changes. Anesthetic-induced thermoregulatory impairment thus depends both on anesthetic type and dose.", 
    "135": "The effectiveness of opioid analgesics in non-cancer neuropathic pain is unpredictable and can be disappointing. It is not clear whether opioids, when effective, relieve pain by decreasing pain intensity or pain unpleasantness or by their sedative effect. The aim of this prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was to assess relief of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness with intravenous infusions of fentanyl.", 
    "136": "We compared the analgesic effect of intravenous dose titration of fentanyl with diazepam (active placebo) or saline (inert placebo) in 53 patients with different types of neuropathic pain. Patients were randomly assigned two consecutive infusions: fentanyl plus diazepam (27 patients) or fentanyl plus saline (26 patients). Study medication was infused at a constant rate for a maximum of 5 h. Pain, sedation, and side-effects were assessed from the start of infusion for 8 h. The primary outcome measure was maximum relief of pain intensity.", 
    "137": "One patient in the fentanyl/diazepam group and two in the fentanyl/saline group were withdrawn. Maximum relief of pain intensity was better with fentanyl than with diazepam (66% [95% CI 53-80] vs 23% [12-35]) or with saline (50% [36-63] vs 12% [4-20]). The beneficial effect of fentanyl was independent of the type of neuropathic pain and the degree of sedation. Fentanyl therapy produced equal relief of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness, whereas diazepam and saline did not reduce either pain index. Patients reported significantly more side-effects while receiving fentanyl than during diazepam or saline infusion (p < 0.0001), but none of the side-effects was severe.",

    "139": "A sample of drug users (n = 158) were contacted and interviewed in non-clinical community settings about their use of Ecstasy, cocaine powder, and amphetamines and the adverse effects of these drugs. Subjects reported a wide range of adverse effects including anxiety problems, depression, mood swings, feelings of paranoia, and panic attacks. Sleep and appetite disturbances were the most commonly reported problems. About half of all subjects reported depression and paranoid feelings associated with their stimulant use. Many of those reporting problems stated that these were mild. However, for all drugs, a substantial minority of users reported adverse effects which they rated as 'severe'. Between 30 and 55% of the sample reported having had at least one 'severe' adverse effect (30% cocaine, 35% Ecstasy and 55% amphetamine). There were clear differences between the different drugs in the likelihood and reported severity of adverse effects. Amphetamine use was associated with significantly more adverse effects and with more severe adverse effects than Ecstasy or cocaine. Cocaine powder was associated with the least severe adverse effects. A common pattern of drug use involved the use of depressant drugs such as opiates and benzodiazepines in addition to stimulants. The stimulant and depressant users were more likely than the stimulants-only users to use stimulants by injection and more likely to report adverse effects associated with stimulant use. The stimulant and depressant users were also more likely to have been treated for a drug problem. Approximately a quarter of the sample stated that they had stopped using stimulants up to the point of interview as a result of their bad experiences.", 
    "140": "The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus as well as on the melanotrope cells of the intermediate lobe (IL) of the pituitary gland. Moreover, the activation of the GABAA receptor complex by different ligands has been shown to exert a negative influence on the POMC gene expression at the hypothalamic level. In order to elucidate the in vivo regulation of the POMC mRNA levels in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary by endogenous ligands of the GABAA receptor complex, we have studied the effect of intravenous (i.v.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injections of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), a peptide derived from diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI). The possible involvement of neurosteroids in the action of ODN on melanotropic cells was evaluated following inhibition of two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of neurosteroids known as activators of G3BAA receptor complex: trilostane, an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), and MK-906, an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase. The i.v. injection of ODN produced a dose-dependent inhibition of POMC gene expression in the IL. The i.c.v. injection of ODN also depressed POMC mRNA. These effects were completely reversed by the concomitant administration of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin. Similar results were obtained in POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (AN) of the hypothalamus. Trilostane administration induced an increase in POMC mRNA and also prevented the inhibitory influence of ODN. The neurosteroid pregnenolone-sulfate, a negative modulator of the GABAA receptor, also stimulated POMC gene expression. On the other hand, MK-906 produced a decrease in mRNA levels and could not reverse the effect of ODN. The results indicate that activation of the GABAA receptor complex by the endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand ODN can induce a negative regulation of POMC gene expression in the IL of the pituitary and neurons in the AN. The present results do not provide clear evidence that neurosteroids are involved in the action of ODN on POMC gene expression in the IL.", 
    "141": "The interactions of several pyrrolo[2, 1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) antitumor antibiotics with linearized plasmid pGEM-2-N-ras DNA have been analyzed by quantitative in vitro transcription (QIVT) and in vitro transcription footprinting (IVTF) methods. A concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of the PBDs on transcription is observed using both techniques. The rank order for overall inhibition of transcription by the QIVT method is found to be: sibiromycin > tomaymycin > anthramycin > DC-81 > neothramycin, whereas the IVTF experiments show a different ranking: sibiromycin > anthramycin > neothramycin > tomaymycin. In addition, stimulation of transcription was observed at low PBD concentrations in both the QIVT and IVTF experiments. These results demonstrate unequivocally that the formation of PBD-DNA adducts at AGA-5' base sequences on the transcribed strand results in transcription blockage for all PBDs examined. Furthermore, the sequence of flanking base pairs appears to influence the degree of blocking, with the sequences ACAGAAA-5', AAAGATG-5', AGAGATA-5', and CAAGAAC-5' providing the most pronounced blocks for all PBDs studied in this system. Neothramycin and tomaymycin cause additional blocks at some GGA-5' and TGA-5' sequences. Parallel MPE-Fe(II) footprinting studies have revealed PBD binding sites on both the transcribing and nontranscribing strands, although all transcription blocks determined from the IVTF assays are due to drug bound on the transcribing DNA template strand.", 
    "142": "In the present study, the fear-potentiated startle response paradigm was modified in order to investigate the decrease in control startle levels often observed after administration of anxiolytic drugs. The within-animal comparison of control startle amplitudes and fear-potentiated startle amplitudes normally used was replaced by a between-animal comparison. Moreover, the experimental design was extended with an additional control group, a no-shock group. The anxiolytics diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were used as pharmacological tools. The main findings were that both benzodiazepines dose-dependently reduced control startle amplitudes and no-shock startle amplitudes equally, suggesting that shock-associated contextual cues are not responsible for the drug-induced decrease in control startle amplitudes in the fear-potentiated startle response paradigm.", 
    "143": "The neurosteroid tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) interacts with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/ benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. To test the hypothesis that THDOC works partially through mechanisms associated with GABAA/BZ receptor function, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and the benzodiazepine, diazepam (DZ), were administered short- (1 day) and long-term (11 days). Levels of mRNA for dynorphin, preprotachykinin and preproenkephalin in the striatum of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were measured by in situ hybridization. Acute DOCA and DZ treatment produced parallel neuropeptide mRNA profiles, whereas chronic DOCA and DZ treatment yielded different patterns of neuropeptide gene expression. Chronic DZ treatment resulted in no significant increase in salt intake whereas chronic DOCA activated salt appetite. We suggest that acute DZ and DOCA interact with GABAA/BZ receptors; however, the results of chronic treatment suggest that DZ and DOCA operate through dissimilar mechanisms.", 
    "144": "Salvia guaranitica St. Hil. is a traditional medicinal plant used in Latin America as sedative. We have recently demonstrated the presence of cirsiliol in its extracts and found that this flavonoid is a competitive low affinity benzodiazepine receptor ligand (Marder et al., 1996). This report describes the pharmacological properties of Salvia guaranitica extracts and of its active principle, cirsiliol. A partially purified fraction of this plant, administered intraperitoneally in mice (in a dose equivalent to 3 g of the fresh plant), exhibited sedative and hypnotic effects as measured in the hole board and in the pentobarbital-induced sleep tests, respectively. On the other hand, this fraction had no anxiolytic or myorelaxant effects. In the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, cirsiliol (2-10mg/kg, i. p.) exhibited a dose-dependent hypnotic action. In contrast, it did not produce myorelaxant (up to 30mg/kg) or anticonvulsant (up to 10mg/kg) effects. Cirsiliol was found to be more potent in displacing (3)H Zolpidem binding (K(i) = 20 LiM) than (3)H flunitrazepam binding (K(i) = 200 \u03bcM) to benzodiazepine receptors from rat cerebral cortex. It is concluded that Salvia guaranitica extracts and its active principle cirsiliol, possess sedative and hypnotic properties; cirsiliol produces these effects probably acting on the so-called type I benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "145": "Benzodiazepines are widely used in the elderly population for the initiation of sleep. However, very frequently, complaints about poor sleep maintenance persist despite benzodiazepine treatment. Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland at night, is involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. Melatonin production decreases with age and can also be inhibited by benzodiazepines. We have recently reported on the association between insomnia and impaired melatonin output in the elderly. In the present study we have investigated the efficacy of melatonin replacement therapy in improving sleep in 21 elderly subjects who have been taking benzodiazepines and had low melatonin output. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover designed study the subjects were treated for three weeks with 2 mg per night of controlled-release melatonin and for 3 weeks with placebo, 2 h before desired bedtime with a 1-week washout period between treatment periods. Subjects' sleep was assessed by wrist actigraphy. Melatonin treatment significantly increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time and decreased wake after sleep onset, sleep latency, number of awakenings and fragmental index, as compared to placebo. The results of our study indicate that melatonin replacement therapy can improve sleep quality in the elderly and that the beneficial effects are augmented in the presence of benzodiazepines.", 
    "146": "(1) The pharmaceutical pricing data for Northern Ireland were amended to include defined daily dosages (DDD) for all single chemical entities. Eight therapeutic groups were studied: antiasthmatics, antidepressants, antimicrobials, benzodiazepines, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), hypoglycaemics, lipid-lowering agents and ulcer-healing drugs. Each group was then subdivided into its main chemical groups. The regional use of each chemical group was defined as the combined DDDs of its individual chemical entities per quarter year, from January 1989 until December 1994. (2) During this period, drug use increased in all eight therapeutic groups and in most of their constituent chemical groups. Increased use of newer drugs did not cause the expected decrease in use of established drugs. Use of all broad-spectrum antimicrobials increased by 314%. Use of sedative benzodiazepines decreased slowly and steadily (16%) throughout the study period but use of all hypnotics increased inexplicably by 21% in 1992 reaching a plateau in 1993 and 1994. SSRI antidepressant use increased sharply (5333%) following their introduction in 1989, accompanied by a 24% increase in use of tricyclic antidepressants. There was a 23,626% increase in the use of proton pump inhibitors and a smaller but steady increase of 38% in use of histamine H(2) antagonists; it is unlikely that much of the prescribing of anti-ulcer and antimicrobials was accurately targeted and rationally defensible. (3) More positively, use of beta(2)-agonist inhalers increased by 45% despite a 254% increase in the use of inhaled steroids. Use of HRT increased by 389% though evidence of under-use is given. There was a steady increase in the use of both insulins (28%) and oral hypoglycaemics (34%). The use of 'statins' (690%) and fibrates (123%) increased. (4) The possible interpretations and implications of these patterns of drug use is discussed, together with their potential as proxies for morbidity incidence in the community.", 
    "147": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a frequent complication of cirrhosis. Portal-systemic shunts and depression of hepatic function are the primary underlying abnormalities. Arterial blood ammonia levels are frequently elevated during hepatic encephalopathy and are lower when a clinical improvement is established. Glutamine synthesis is part of the metabolic pathway for ammonia cerebral detoxification that induces ATP and glutamate (excitatory neurotransmitter) depletion. Plasma levels of branched chain amino acids are reduced in patients with cirrhosis, this event allows aromatic amino acids to cross the hemato-liquoral barrier through exchange with glutamine. Cerebral excess of aromatic amino acids promotes the synthesis of octopamine and feniletiletanolamine, weak neurotransmitters. Benzodiazepine-like substances may affect GABA-ergic transmission by interacting with their receptors on the GABA-benzodiazepine complex. Therapy is aimed at controlling the events that may precipitate the acute encephalopathy, at reducing the ammonia levels, and correcting the neurotransmission abnormalities."
