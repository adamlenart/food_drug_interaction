    "0": "The question whether chronic membrane depolarization regulates selectively the expression of different muscarinic cholinergic receptors has been studied in primary neuronal cultures prepared from two regions of embryonic rat brain. Chronic (3 or 6 days) but not acute (3 or 24 h) membrane depolarization of cultured septal neurons with 40 mM potassium chloride have increased the number of muscarinic receptors by 168 +/- 28%, but no such effect has been observed with hippocampal cultures. Displacement experiments with the M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine have shown that muscarinic receptors in the septum of adult rat have 3-5 times lower affinity to this compound than hippocampus receptors. The results suggest that chronic membrane depolarization selectively increases the number of presynaptic muscarinic receptors, expressed by septal neurons, whereas hippocampal neurons expressing postsynaptic receptors have no such response.", 
    "1": "Continuous subcutaneous administration of triazolam, a benzodiazepine with short plasma half-life, for 10 days either decreased (31%, 2 mg/day) or increased (15%, 0.5 mg/day) radioligand binding to adenosine A2 receptors in the rat striatum. In a similar manner, we have shown previously that diazepam (5-10 mg/day), a benzodiazepine with a long plasma half-life attenuated radioligand binding to adenosine A2 receptors in the rat striatum by 45-25%.", 
    "2": "The effects of various mu and kappa opioid agonists were evaluated in three squirrel monkeys responding under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food presentation before, during and after a regimen of chronic morphine administration. Initially, dose-effect curves for the mu opioid agonists morphine and l-methadone, the kappa opioid agonists U50,488 and tifluadom, the mixed mu/kappa opioid agonist ethylketocyclazocine, and the non-opioid compound pentobarbital were determined in non-tolerant squirrel monkeys. Subsequently, monkeys were administered up to 3.0 mg/kg of morphine twice daily for 8-9 weeks, which resulted in a 1/2 to 3/4 log unit shift to the right of the morphine dose-effect curve relative to its prechronic position. During the chronic morphine regimen, the l-methadone dose-effect curve shifted to the right approximately 3/4 log unit, while the U50,488 and pentobarbital dose-effect curves did not change. In contrast, the ethylketocyclazocine and tifluadom dose-effect curves shifted to the left approximately 1/4 and 3/4 log unit, respectively. The lack of cross-tolerance between mu and kappa agonists in morphine-tolerant squirrel monkeys observed in the present study provides further support for the differentiation of mu and kappa agonists. The occurrence of leftward shifts in the dose-effect curves of some opioid compounds with kappa agonist activity during the regimen of chronic morphine administration suggests that morphine tolerance modulates their", 
    "3": "The effects of extracellular Ca2+ on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced Cl- current and the efficacy of diazepam in the facilitation of GABA response were studied in frog isolated sensory neurons, using a 'concentration clamp' technique which combines a suction pipette (internal perfusion and voltage clamp) and a rapid drug application system. When nominal Ca2+-free external solution was changed to the solution containing 2 mM Ca2+, the response elicited by 1 x 10(-5) M GABA was reduced by about 40% of the control obtained in nominal Ca2+-free solution. The dose-response curve for GABA was shifted to the right without affecting the maximum response. It can be suggested that the application of external Ca2+ modulates the affinity of the GABA receptor to its agonist, GABA. Diazepam at the concentration of 3 x 10(-6) M shifted the dose-response curve for GABA to the left without changing the maximum response with or without external Ca2+. However, the augmentatory action of diazepam on the GABA response was reduced in the presence of external Ca2+. Possible mechanisms for inhibitory action of external Ca2+ on the GABA-gated response and the reduced efficacy of diazepam are discussed.", 
    "4": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with a short half life (1.5-2.5 h) due to intense biotransformation by liver monooxygenases. Anecdotal clinical reports have mentioned a wide interpatient variability in its duration of action. We investigated by in vitro screening factors that could interfere with the rate of midazolam biotransformation (drug-drug interactions). Metabolite production (1'-and 4-OH-midazolam) was monitored in human liver microsomes. Midazolam hydroxylations are inhibited by several drugs (i.e. erythromycin, phenothiazine-type neuroleptics, cyclosporine). The clinical relevance of these drug interactions is illustrated by the example of a patient treated with amiodarone, erythromycin and midazolam during anesthesia. Midazolam-induced sleep lasted about 6 days due to inhibition of its biotransformation by concomitant drug treatment.", 
    "5": "Three different doses of the M1-selective antimuscarinic compound telenzepine were investigated in the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer in a randomized, double-blind dose-range finding study. In four investigating centers, 120 patients with endoscopically proven, florid duodenal ulcer were treated with either 1.5 mg, 3 mg or 5 mg telenzepine once daily at bedtime (40 patients per dose group). After two weeks of treatment differences in the healing rates were statistically not significant. After four weeks the ulcers of 26 (65%) patients in the 1.5 mg group and 34 (85%) and 31 (78%) in the 3 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively, were completely healed. Only the difference in the healing rates between the 1.5 and 3 mg groups was significant at p less than 0.05. Mean reductions in ulcer area were 90% (1.5 mg), 97% (3 mg) and 93% (5 mg) after four weeks; 1.5 vs. 3 mg, p less than 0.025. These results show that telenzepine dose-dependently accelerates ulcer healing and that maximal effect is obtained with the 3-mg dose. The ulcer symptoms were dose-dependently alleviated. Dry mouth of moderate or severe intensity was stated more frequently under 5 mg telenzepine (by 14% of patients) than under 1.5 and 3 mg (5% each). The antimuscarinic side effect \"disturbed accommodation\" was rarely found. It is concluded that once daily administration of 3 mg in the evening must be regarded as the optimal dosage regimen of telenzepine.", 
    "6": "To determine if the risk of hip fracture difference between persons receiving benzodiazepines with long (greater than or equal to 24 hours) or short (less than 24 hours) elimination half-lives, we conducted a nested case-control study among residents of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan who were 65 years of age and older. We identified 4501 cases occurring between 1977 and 1985 from computerized hospital records and 24,041 population controls. Current benzodiazepine use, defined as having filled a prescription in the past 30 days, was ascertained from computerized pharmacy records. The relative risk of hip fracture was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.0) for current users of long half-life benzodiazepines, in contrast to that of 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.3) for current users of short half-life drugs. This finding was not altered by sex, age, calendar year, nursing home residence, or history of hospitalization. Medical record review for a sample of 189 cases suggested that this finding was not due to confounding by dementia, ambulatory status, functional status, or body mass.", 
    "7": "The presence of benzodiazepine (BZD)-like molecules as well as of other substances with affinity for the brain BZD-receptors was explored in eight non-flowering plants known to contain biflavonoids, three flowering plants used as sedatives in folkloric medicine and one plant extensively used in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay as a tea substitute. All the plants examined contained substances which bound to the central BZD-receptors and the majority of them also had BZD-like compounds detected by their specific interaction with a monoclonal antibody against BZDs. In various cases this last type of compound was present in amounts which exceeded trace levels (0.5-1.0 ng/g). The biological or clinical significance for humans of all these substances should be explored.", 
    "8": "The medicine consumption and the employment of alternative treatment were investigated in a material of 117 patients with disseminated sclerosis (DS) considered to be a representative sample of the patients with DS in the County of Funen. This investigation revealed that the preparations most commonly employed to modify the disease among patients with disseminated sclerosis were: spasmolytics, agents to counteract neurogenic bladder symptoms, benzodiazepine and analgesics. The consumption of medicine increased with increasing handicap. Employment of psychopharmaca was commonest in patients in social classes 4 and 5 and in women. In addition, is was found that there was no difference in social class, sex and age among the patients who employ alternative methods of treatment. The patients themselves have not experienced any effect from alternative treatment.", 
    "9": "Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was determined in parallel groups of conscious rats receiving diazepam (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) either acutely or following subacute (5 mg/kg i.p. daily for 3 days) or chronic (5 mg/kg i.p. daily for 28 days) diazepam pretreatment, using 2-deoxyglucose quantitative autoradiography. Acute administration of diazepam reduced LCGU in 44 of the 66 structures examined compared to vehicle-treated controls. These included limbic, cortical and extrapyramidal structures, and areas associated with sensory processing. These data are consistent with many brain regions being functionally involved in the diverse acute pharmacological effects of diazepam and with the widespread distribution of benzodiazepine receptors throughout the neuroaxis. Following subacute treatment, when animals were tolerant to the sedative effects of diazepam, glucose use remained depressed in the majority of areas studied. However, in the locus coeruleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus and most structures associated with auditory processing, tolerance to the depressant effect of diazepam upon glucose use had occurred suggesting the importance of these structures in the sedative effect of diazepam. The most striking feature of the patterns of LCGU after chronic diazepam treatment was that tolerance had occurred in the mammillary body and subiculum. However, glucose use remained depressed in hippocampal layers and in structures that provide input to the hippocampus (e.g. raphe nuclei). These data suggest that the outflow of neuronal activity from the hippocampus to the mammillary body via the subiculum is restored after chronic treatment, and may implicate these pathways in the anxiolytic action of diazepam. Overall, it would appear that different neuroanatomical substrates underlie the various pharmacological effects of diazepam and that there may be regional differences in tolerance mechanisms.", 
    "10": "Fasciculin 2 (FAS) an anticholinesterase peptide isolated from the venom of the Green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps) was injected into the right striatum of albino rats (1.5 micrograms total amount). The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was 86 and 60% 24 h and 7 days after FAS injection, respectively. The treatment with apomorphine (APO) (2 mg/kg s.c.) 24 h after FAS provoked a moderate circling towards the lesioned side that was reverted by atropine (30 mg/kg i.p.). The same dose of APO 7 days after FAS, provoked an inconstant contralateral circling. Neither dopamine nor serotonin nor their metabolites were significantly affected 24 h or 7 days after FAS injection. Radioligand binding assays of dopamine, muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors only showed a decrease of the density of the muscarinic ones 7 days after FAS. These results are interpreted as showing that the changes provoked by FAS would be compensated but the system would remain in an unsteady state only demonstrable after pharmacological challenge. The chronic down-regulation of muscarinic receptors would compensate the increased cholinergic activity and would therefore block its behavioral expression.", 
    "11": "Carbachol (CCh)-stimulated hydrolysis of inositol lipids in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells was systematically characterized in parallel with the carbachol effects on cAMP formation. Carbachol concentration-dependently induced the hydrolysis of inositol lipids and formation of [3H]IP3, [3H]IP2 and [3H]IP1 in these cells labeled with [3H]inositol. The maximal amount of [3H]IP1 accumulated in the presence of 10 mM LiCl was about 50-fold above the basal level. The EC50 value of CCh was 14 microM. The muscarinic antagonists atropine, pirenzepine and 11-[[2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido [2,3-b] (1,4)-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) competitively inhibited CCh-induced [3H]IP1 accumulation. The functional inhibition constants (converted from the pA2 values) were 0.24, 8.1 and 470 nM, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the inhibition constants of these drugs from antagonist/[3H]pirenzepine studies using intact cells. Forskolin, adenosine and PGE1 stimulated cAMP formation in this cell line. Morphine decreased PGE1-induced cAMP formation as well as the basal cAMP formation. However, CCh did not stimulate or inhibit the basal cAMP formation. Also, CCh did not have any effects on the adenosine and PGE1-induced cAMP formation in these cells. These data suggest that muscarinic M1 receptors are coupled to the hydrolysis of inositol lipids and not to the adenylate cyclase system in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.", 
    "12": "Immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor showed labeled axo-dendritic synapses in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. In the dorsal cochlear nucleus, label was seen apposing both axo-somatic and axo-dendritic terminals. The results suggest a heterogeneous distribution of GABA receptors, together with a possible segregation of receptor subtypes between somata and dendrites in certain neurons. The presence of cytoplasmic labeling in some neurons might reflect a higher receptor turnover rate in these neurons.", 
    "13": "Specific, saturable and reversible binding of [3H]beta + CCE ([3H]beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) in buffer containing 20 microM AgNO3 and 10 microM diazepam was detected in rat brain membranes. The binding of [3H]beta CCE to non-benzodiazepine binding sites is Ag+ (Cu)-dependent, stimulated by NaCl and ascorbic acid and inhibited by dithiothreitol. The concentration of non-benzodiazepine [3H]beta CCE binding sites (Bmax) determined in the brain membranes was 1180 +/- 320 pmol/g tissue, and Kd = 77 +/- 19 nM. [3H]beta CCE bound to benzodiazepine receptors in the same membranes with Bmax = 81 +/- 9 pmol/g tissue and Kd = 3.2 +/- 0.4 nM.", 
    "14": "L-Lysine enhanced specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding dose dependently on extensively washed bovine brain membrane in vitro. This enhancement was stimulated by chloride ions dose dependently. Scatchard analysis indicated this enhancement by L-lysine to be due to increase in binding affinity (KD) with no change in receptor density (Bmax). Since enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by L-lysine was partially inhibited by picrotoxinin, L-lysine may act on a distinct picrotoxinin-sensitive site which was distinct from the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor site. This binding site, however, appears to have some features resembling that of the central nervous system-depressant barbiturates.", 
    "15": "This report describes the cloning of a full length cDNA encoding PKBS, a protein of approximately 17 kDa associated with peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. Cyanogen bromide digestion of purified PKBS yielded several peptide fragments which were subjected to gas-phase sequencing. Based on these partial amino acid sequences, oligonucleotide probes were used to screen a rat adrenal cDNA library. Several hybridizing clones were isolated which were found to contain overlapping sequences. The longest cDNA spanned 781 base pairs and specified an open reading frame of 169 amino acids which matched all of the peptide sequences. Northern analysis with this PKBS cDNA probe in different rat tissues revealed one RNA species of approximately 850 nucleotides exhibiting relative abundances qualitatively comparable with the densities of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in each tissue. The PKBS cDNA was cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector placing it under transcriptional control of the beta-globin promoter and SV40 enhancer. Transfection of the transformed human kidney 293 cell line with this recombinant vector resulted in stoichiometric increases of about 900 fmol/mg of protein in binding capacities for Ro5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) and PK 11195, two peripheral-type benzodiazepine ligands. These increases were accounted for by the expression of binding sites with approximate dissociation constants of 5 nM for PK 11195 and 8 nM for Ro5-4864, thereby distinguishing the expressed binding sites as being characteristic of the receptor from rat origin rather than of the host human-derived cell line. The rank order of potency of different ligands to compete against [3H]Ro5-4864 binding in the transfected cells was PK 11195 greater than Ro5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than protoporphyrin IX greater than clonazepam, consistent with the specificity characteristic of rat peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. These studies suggest that PKBS comprises binding domains for benzodiazepines and isoquinoline carboxamides and hence is apparently responsible for the manifestation of peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "16": "Behavioral and neurochemical evidence indicates interactions between caffeine and other adenosine receptor ligands and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine system. To assess the effects of caffeine on binding and function at the GABAA receptor, we studied the effects of behaviorally-active doses of caffeine on benzodiazepine and Cl- channel binding and on overall function of the GABAA receptor as measured by Cl- uptake. There was no effect of caffeine on benzodiazepine receptor binding in cortical synaptosomal membranes at concentrations of 1-100 microM. No effects on benzodiazepine binding were found ex vivo in mice treated with caffeine, 20 and 40 mg/kg. At the putative Cl- channel site labeled by t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), binding was unchanged in vitro after caffeine treatment (1 and 10 microM) in washed and unwashed membranes. However, in ex vivo studies caffeine (20 and 40 mg/kg) increased numbers of TBPS sites in unwashed but not washed membranes. Muscimol-stimulated Cl- uptake into cortical synaptoneurosomes was decreased in mice treated with caffeine, 20 and 40 mg/kg. Similar results were observed in in vitro preparations treated with 50 microM but not 100 microM caffeine. These results indicate that caffeine administration significantly alters the Cl- transport function of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "17": "Anxiolytic drugs are adjuncts to non-pharmacological treatments for anxiety. Alcohol and tobacco remain the major psychoactive agents that are used in our community. Benzodiazepine drugs are the agents of choice if an acute reduction in anxiety or intermittent therapy is needed and are helpful for long-term use in a few patients. For panic disorders, alprazolam is effective for short- and long-term treatment, although it needs a slow reduction in dosage and carries a risk of withdrawal reactions in about 30% of sufferers. Clonazepam also may help panic attacks and possibly other benzodiazepine agents would show similar effects at equivalent doses. Antidepressant drugs, including monoamine-oxidase inhibitor agents, although more toxic and sometimes less tolerated than is alprazolam, have antipanic effects in high doses and are of use for prolonged therapy for panic disorders. Neuroleptic agents' general usefulness as anxiolytic drugs is restricted because of their acute and long-term toxicity. There is no place for the use of antidepressant or neuroleptic drugs as treatments of first choice in uncomplicated generalized anxiety. beta-blocking agents have limited adjunctive use for performance anxiety and social phobias. Buspirone heralds a new class of anxiolytic agents. Buspirone has advantages in patients who can tolerate its slow onset of action, with reduced psychomotor effects, lower interactive effects with cortical depressant substances and a seeming lack of dependency or any withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "18": "The proto-oncogene c-fos is rapidly induced by a variety of stimuli including wounding of the cortex. In an attempt to define the conditions necessary for c-fos activation, we have studied the effects of cerebral devascularization (CD; unilateral pial disruption), a procedure which results in ischaemia without producing direct physical damage to the tissues. Cerebral devascularization produces c-fos activation throughout the ipsilateral cortex; this effect lasts for about 4 h and is not confined to the area subjacent to pial disruption. The activation of c-fos is not prevented by even high doses of benzodiazepines but is effectively reduced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (glutamate) receptor antagonist ketamine.", 
    "19": "The present study shows that N-[3H]methylcarbamylcholine ([3H]MCC) binds to a single population of high-affinity/low-density (KD = 5.0 nM; Bmax = 8.2 fmol/mg of protein) nicotinic binding sites in the rat cerebellum. Also, there exists a single class of high-affinity binding sites (KD = 4.8 nM; Bmax = 24.2 fmol/mg of protein) in the cerebellum for the M1 specific muscarinic ligand [3H]pirenzepine. In contrast, the M2 ligand, [3H]AF-DX 116, appears to bind to two classes of binding sites, i.e., a high-affinity (KD = 3 nM)/low-capacity (Bmax = 11.7 fmol/mg of protein) class, and a second class of lower affinity (KD = 28.4 nM) and higher capacity (Bmax = 36.3 fmol/mg of protein) sites. The putative M3 selective ligand [3H]4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine also binds to two distinct classes of binding sites in cerebellar homogenates, one of high affinity (KD = 0.5 nM)/low capacity (Bmax = 19.5 fmol/mg of protein) and one of low affinity (KD = 57.5 nM)/high capacity (Bmax = 140.6 fmol/mg of protein). In experiments which tested the effects of cholinergic drugs on acetylcholine release from cerebellar brain slices, the nicotinic agonist MCC enhanced spontaneous acetylcholine release in a concentration-dependent manner, and the maximal increase in acetylcholine release (59.0-68.0%) occurred at 10(-7) M. The effect of MCC to increase acetylcholine release was Ca2+-dependent and tetrodotoxin-insensitive, suggesting an action on cholinergic terminals. Also, the MCC-induced increase in acetylcholine release was effectively antagonized by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, d-tubocurarine, and kappa-bungarotoxin, but was insensitive to either atropine or alpha-bungarotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The technique of estimating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) turnover by inhibiting its major degrading enzyme GABA-T (4-aminobutyrate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase; EC 2.6.1.19) and measuring GABA accumulation has been used repeatedly, but, at least in rats, its usefulness has been limited by several difficulties, including marked differences in the degree of GABA-T inhibition in different brain regions after systemic injection of GABA-T inhibitors. In an attempt to improve this type of approach for measuring GABA turnover, the time course of GABA-T inhibition and accumulation of GABA in 12 regions of rat brain has been studied after systemic administration of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), injected at various doses and with different routes of administration. A total and rapidly occurring inhibition of GABA-T in all regions was obtained with intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg AOAA, whereas after lower doses, marked regional differences in the degree of GABA-T inhibition were found, thus leading to underestimation of GABA synthesis rates, e.g., in substantia nigra. The activity of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD (L-glutamate-1-decarboxylase; EC 4.1.1.15) was not reduced significantly at any time after intraperitoneal injection of AOAA, except for a small decrease in olfactory bulbs. Even the highest dose of AOAA tested (100 mg/kg) was not associated with toxicity in rats, but induced motor impairment, which was obviously related to the marked GABA accumulation found with this dose. The increase in GABA concentrations induced with intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg AOAA was rapid in onset, allowing one to estimate GABA turnover rates from the initial rate of GABA accumulation, i.e., during the first 30 min after AOAA injection. GABA turnover rates thus determined were correlated in a highly significant fashion with the GAD activities determined in brain regions, with highest turnover rates measured in substantia nigra, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, and tectum. Pretreatment of rats with diazepam, 5 mg/kg i.p., 5-30 min prior to AOAA, reduced the AOAA-induced GABA accumulation in all 12 regions examined, most probably as a result of potentiation of postsynaptic GABA function. The data indicate that AOAA is a valuable tool for regional GABA turnover studies in rats, provided the GABA-T inhibitor is administered in sufficiently high doses to obtain complete inhibition of GABA degradation.", 
    "21": "Among 169 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), standard therapy (with clidinium bromide, chlordiazepoxide and isaphaghulla), a compound Ayurvedic preparation (with Aegle marmelos correa plus Bacopa monniere Linn) along with a matching placebo were given in a double blind randomised trial for 6 wk. The Ayurvedic preparation in 57 patients was found effective in 64.9 per cent, while standard therapy (60 patients) was useful in 78.3 per cent. Patients on placebo (52 patients) showed improvement in 32.7 per cent only. Ayurvedic therapy was particularly beneficial in diarrhoea predominant form as compared to placebo. The standard therapy was more useful in the painful form of IBS as compared to placebo and Ayurvedic preparation. In gas predominant form the effect of standard as well as Ayurvedic therapy, was similar to placebo. Long-term follow-up (greater than 6 months) showed that both forms of therapy were no better than placebo in limiting the relapse.", 
    "22": "Midazolam (M) has been successfully used in oral and rectal premedication of children of one to six years of age. The following study was designed to investigate the efficacy of both methods when used as premedication \"on demand\". 60 children (1-6 years) were randomly assigned to 0.3 mg/kg bw M orally and 0.5 mg/kg bw M rectally. Psychological, behavioural and physiological parameters were measured at special time intervals and special stressful events (separation from the mother or father, induction of anaesthesia). Rectally premedicated children were found to be better prepared concerning psychological and behavioural parameters. This can be due to the dosage as well as the faster absorption of M. In the postoperative period orally premedicated children experienced significantly more nausea and vomiting. This might be due to the preparation with saccharin, peppermint oil and ethanol. - In \"premedication on demand\" rectal Midazolam must be preferred to orally administered Midazolam in the preparation mentioned above.", 
    "23": "Nausea and vomiting are the most feared toxicities of chemotherapy. Afferent impulses from the chemoreceptor trigger zone, peripheral sites, the cerebral cortex, or the vestibular center can initiate the emetic reflex. Antiemetic protection therefore requires interruption of appropriate emetogenic pathways. Since the chemoreceptor trigger zone contains numerous dopaminergic neurons, antidopaminergic agents including phenothiazines and metoclopramide have gained importance as antiemetics. However standard dose phenothiazines have limited efficacy while high dose metoclopramide may have excessive toxicity in the non-cisplatin setting. Recent advances have therefore centered on development of new classes of antiemetics. Corticosteroids have excellent activity alone or in combination with other antiemetic agents. Cannabinoids have recently been introduced into commercial use as antiemetics with particular activity against non-cisplatin chemotherapy. Benzodiazepines are active against anticipatory nausea and vomiting and are also used in combination antiemetic regimens. Although the vestibular center seems to have a lesser influence on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, vestibular blocking agents such as scopolamine may have a potential role as adjunctive antiemetics. Finally, appreciation of the role of serotonin (5-HT3) receptors in both peripheral and central emetic pathways may lead to a new class of antiserotonergic antiemetic agents.",

Sixteen subjects, ages 21-59 years (seven men, nine women) with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were treated with an average of phenelzine 53.5 mg/day for an average of 10 weeks in an open treatment study. No significant effects on plasma levels of pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, were discernible in this group, nor was there any clear relationship between pyridoxal phosphate levels and symptoms in the subgroup of five patients who did develop deficiency-type symptoms. Pyridoxine replacement had unclear effects in symptomatic patients.", 
    "25": "The combination of haloperidol, 5 mg, and lorazepam, 4 mg, was both effective and safe for managing agitated behavior in an open trial with acutely psychotic patients. The combination also appeared to be superior to its individual components when studied in a randomized, nonblind trial. The principle of the combined use of antipsychotics and sedative-hypnotics was further tested by comparing two new combinations: thiothixene, 5 mg, and lorazepam, 4 mg, versus haloperidol, 5 mg, and phenobarbital sodium, 130 mg. These combinations had comparable efficacy and safety, and the level of transquilization approached that produced by the haloperidol-lorazepam combination in the preceding studies.", 
    "26": "The effects of zopiclone on sleep spindles were analyzed in six normal volunteers by using an improved waveform recognition method. The appearance rate of spindles during stage 2 of NREM sleep showed a significant increase on the drug night, which returned to the baseline on the withdrawal night. The mean duration of spindles was significantly prolonged on the drug night. No definite changes were observed in the average spindle frequency. The mean amplitude of spindles had a tendency to decrease on the drug night. On the withdrawal night, the mean amplitude decreased significantly compared with that of the baseline. Our results indicate that zopiclone is one of the spindle enhancing drugs, and that its property resembles that of benzodiazepines.", 
    "27": "The distinct theta rhythm in the frontal midline area during performance of mental tasks has been designated as Fm theta. Sixteen male university students who failed to show any appearance of Fm theta in 3 consecutive days were given diazepam 5 mg, amobarbital 80 mg, methylphenidate 15 mg and placebo, in a double-blind, crossover design. Scores were made on the state anxiety scale of STAI; EEGs were recorded before and during performance of an arithmetic addition. The test was repeated twice: before and one hr after drug administration. Fm theta appeared following the drug administration even in those who had never shown the appearance of Fm theta, and the appearance time of Fm theta increased in the following order: diazepam greater than amobarbital greater than placebo greater than methylphenidate. The scores of STAI decreased in the same order. The speed of performed tasks was increased by methylphenidate and placebo, but decreased by amobarbital and diazepam. These results suggest that relief from anxiety might be reflected in the appearance of Fm theta and that Fm theta might be a useful tool to measure the anxiety level in humans.",

Patients in group A were orally given tramadol 100 mg and lorazepam 1 mg and those in group B flunitrazepam 1 mg was given. Those in group A, who did not need supplemental medication during ESWL were subdivided in group A while those who needed an adjuvant of 100 micrograms intravenous fentanyl were subdivided in group A2. Like group A, those in group B, who did not need supplemental drug and those who needed 100 micrograms intravenous fentanyl were respectively subcategorized into groups B1 and B2. Drugs were given with 15 mL water 30 min prior to ESWL. Pre-operatively, an intravenous line and monitoring system which included noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oximeter were established. The entire course was divided into 5 stages i.e. stage I (prior to oral medication), stage II (10 min after medication), stage III (10 min following ESWL), stage IV (5 min following 100 micrograms intravenous fentanyl) and stage V (10 min after ESWL). The mean blood pressure, heart rate and SpO2, pain scale, sedation scale and side effects were recorded in various stages. The results showed that in group A 68 patients passed the ESWL smoothly (A1) and 32 patients needed supplemental fentanyl (A2). In group B 70 patients successfully underwent the ESWL (B1) while 30 patients needed supplemental fentanyl (B2).

Ifosfamide was administered 24 h after the final injection of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam or oxazepam (100 mg/kg/d for 3 d, i.p.). The prior administration of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam or oxazepam enhanced the toxicity of ifosfamide (778 mg/kg, i.p.) during observation for 6 d after the administration of ifosfamide. In chlordiazepoxide-, diazepam- or oxazepam-treated mice, a higher concentration of active metabolite in the plasma after the administration of ifosfamide (200 or 600 mg/kg, i.p.) was observed as compared with that in mice treated with ifosfamide alone. On the other hand, chlordizepoxide, diazepam or oxazepam markedly enhanced the activity of ifosfamide oxidase in the liver microsomes. These results suggest that the potentiation of ifosfamide toxicity is due to stimulation of the metabolic activation of ifosfamide by chlordizepoxide, diazepam and oxazepam.", 
    "30": "Ethanol and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and their interaction on 36Cl-influx were analyzed in cultured embryonic palate and limb mesenchymal cells in order to determine whether ethanol exerts its teratogenic action through a GABA receptor involved in embryogenesis. Cl- transport in secondary cultures of C57BL/6 palate mesenchymal cells was shown to consist of three systems including the electroneutral Cl-/HCO3- exchange (50%) and Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport (30%) pathways and the voltage-dependent Cl- channel (20%). Treatment with DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) or SITS (4-acetamido-4'-isocyano-stilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid) in SWV palate cells inhibited the Cl-/HCO3- exchange pathway, while treatment with DIDS and bumetanide inhibited both the exchange and cation cotransport pathways, the residual Cl- influx inferred to be the electrogenic pathway. Inhibition of Cl- transport by anthracene-9-carboxylic acid confirmed the presence of the electrogenic Cl- pathway. It was observed that the rate of Cl- transport was significantly greater in palate cells of C57BL/6 mice than those of SWV mice. Also the rate of Cl- transport was significantly greater in secondary cultures of palate cells from C57BL/6 mice than from primary cultures of limb cells from the same strain. No evidence could be obtained that ethanol (10 to 100 mM) or GABA (3 X 10(-5) M) or their combination stimulated total Cl- influx in either C57BL/6 or SWV palate mesenchymal cells, putative voltage-dependent Cl- influx in C57BL/6 palate cells, or total Cl- influx in primary cultures of C57BL/6 limb mesenchymal cells.", 
    "31": "Rats displayed a reduction in the percentage of time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze 24-30 hours after withdrawal from chronic chlordiazepoxide treatment (10 mg/kg/day IP for 4 weeks). This indicated an anxiogenic response in this test. This anxiogenic response was not significantly reversed by DL-propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg IP) or clonidine (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg IP). These results provide no evidence to suggest that the anxiogenic effects of chlordiazepoxide withdrawal are mediated by an increase in noradrenergic activity. The possible involvement of multiple transmitter systems in benzodiazepine withdrawal symptomology is discussed.", 
    "32": "Experiments were conducted to elucidate the behavioral effects of RO 15-4513, a putative alcohol antagonist, when administered alone or in combination with alcohol. Two groups of animals were trained to lever-press for brain self-stimulation (ICSS) on either a fixed ratio:15 or a fixed interval:15 second schedule of reinforcement. RO 15-4513 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) reduced the rate of lever-pressing for ICSS in both groups. RO 15-4513 (1.0 mg/kg) further reduced rates when combined with alcohol (0.1-1.7 g/kg), and this effect was especially marked in the fixed ratio paradigm. Other groups of animals were tested in a locomotor activity apparatus. In contrast to the depression of lever-pressing in the ICSS experiments, RO 15-4513 produced a graded increase in locomotor activity. When combined with alcohol (0.1-1.7 g/kg), 1.0 mg/kg RO 15-4513 also increased locomotor activity. Thus, the depression in schedule-controlled behavior was not associated with a generalized behavioral depression. These results demonstrated that RO 15-4513 has potent behavioral effects of its own that are consistent with its classification as an anxiogenic compound.", 
    "33": "In children, rectal midazolam is being used increasingly for premedication, as this substance is reported to have a short half-life and rapid action. Above all it is the only known diazepam derivative with a good correlation of plasma concentration and clinical action despite its receptor binding capacity. As pharmacokinetic data in children are lacking and different dose regimens for rectal premedication exist, we studied plasma concentrations in 3 groups of children. METHODS. After obtaining informed parental consent we studied children aged 3-7 years (15-30 kg body weight) ASA I status scheduled for minor elective surgery. Group 1 (n = 6) received 0.1 mg/kg midazolam i.v. for induction of anesthesia. Group 2 (n = 10) was premedicated with 0.35 mg/kg midazolam, instilled just behind the anal sphincter; group 3 (n = 5) received 0.5 mg/kg midazolam rectally. Blood samples were drawn up to 120 min after application. The anesthesia technique consisted of N2O/O2, enflurane, intubation and the use of muscle relaxants, if necessary. Midazolam plasma levels were measured by HPLC. RESULTS. There were no differences with respect to age or body weight. Group 1: half-life in children was shorter than in adults, Vdss was smaller and clearance identical. Group 2: Rectal midazolam 0.35 mg/kg has a remarkably short onset of action with peak plasma concentrations (71 ng/ml) in the range of sedative levels in adults occurring in 7.5 min. After 2 h they reached levels of 30 ng/ml. Group 3 patients had peak levels of midazolam of 246 ng/ml after 12.5 min, falling to an average concentration of 120 ng/ml after 2 h. The bioavailability of rectal midazolam, comparing the area under the median curves, is 4.7% in group 2 and 16.1% in group 3.", 
    "34": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam in our patients showed a shorter half-life, probably due to the higher hepatic clearance based on the high CI in children, as midazolam is known to have a first-pass effect of 30-70%. The increased metabolic transformation and the smaller amount of fatty tissue accounts for the smaller Vdss in children compared to adults. Rectal midazolam has a remarkably short onset and especially in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg prolonged action due to ongoing resorption from the rectum as demonstrated by the clinically relevant plasma concentrations. This fact must be taken into consideration in the overall anesthesia management.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The present study was done in order to investigate the central nervous activity in patients (n = 15) after maxillo-facial surgery, 5 and 90 minutes post ketamine-midazolam-anesthesia. The combination of a benzodiazepine with ketamine was thought to be beneficial to reduce the usual excitatory effects after ketamine postoperatively. In order to demonstrate these benefits EEG-power spectra as well somatosensory-evoked potentials were derived (Neurotrac). Additionally, the central nervous effects were correlated with blood pressure changes. 5 minutes post ketamine-midazolam-anesthesia EEG-power spectra showed a marked depression in the alpha, theta and delta power band when compared to the control-awake situation. However, power in the beta domain (13-30 Hz) was significantly elevated. 90 minutes post anesthesia the high power values returned back to control. In no instance were there any signs of theta-paroxysms which can be taken as an index for central excitation. In the evoked potential a significant increase in amplitude of the early N20 and late N50 peak was evident. This correlated with an increase in systolic blood pressure. 90 minutes post anesthesia only the late N50 peak still remained elevated suggesting some residual excitatory effects in the thalamo-cortical projection area to be present. The latter may reflect an increase in activity in the associative cortical areas of the cerebral cortex. In general however, the additional administration of midazolam resulted in a marked reduction in excitatory central nervous effects when compared to the well known excitation after sole ketamine injection. Thus, the beneficial venture of the two separate classes of anesthetics is advocated for clinical practice.", 
    "36": "Propylene glycol, ethanol and benzyl alcohol are usually included in the injection solutions of diazepam, flunitrazepam and others as solvents and/or pain relief agents. It was reported that diazepam and flunitrazepam inhibited oxidative burst of human neutrophils to produce O2-, H2O2 and other active oxygen species. However, the present study revealed that the solvents had far more potent inhibitory effects in this regard than diazepam and flunitrazepam themselves. The solvents reversibly inhibited phagocytosis and O2- production by neutrophils, and they were stimulated by both soluble stimulants, phorbol myristate acetate or laurate, and a particulate stimulant, serum opsonized zymosan, in a dose-dependent manner. Benzyl alcohol, which had the most potent effect among the solvents, appeared to inhibit the O2- generating enzyme NADPH oxidase directly, rather than by affecting intracellular calcium mobilization. Thus one should keep in mind such unexpected effects of the solvents included in solutions for injection.", 
    "37": "The urine samples from two groups of Veteran's Administration patients newly admitted to general psychiatry units were screened in 1985 and in 1987-88 for abused drugs. The results were compared with urine samples from controls with similar age distributions admitted to an alcohol and drug abuse unit or to medical-surgical units. About 40% of all newly admitted patients were positive for one or more controlled drugs, but there were no significant differences among patient groups in the percentage of urine samples positive for these drugs. Marijuana and benzodiazepines were detected frequently in all patient groups and often in combination, although opiates also were frequently detected in the urine samples from the medical-surgical patients. There was a clear decrease in drug-positive samples with age in all patient groups, much of which could be accounted for by decreased marijuana detection.", 
    "38": "We studied 26 patients in a double-blind investigation to compare psychomotor and cognitive recovery for 30 h after sedation for day-case gastroscopy with i.v. diazepam 0.15 mg kg-1 or midazolam 0.07 mg kg-1. Significantly more patients reported side effects at 7, 10 and 30 h post-gastroscopy after diazepam than after midazolam (P less than 0.05). Compared with baseline, the midazolam group was significantly impaired in critical flicker fusion threshold, reaction time, dexterity and visualization tasks up to 4 h after administration (P less than 0.05). There was a significant association between midazolam and amnesia for the procedure (P less than 0.001).", 
    "39": "A case is described of a patient with a history of several years of diazepam abuse (in the last 24 months at dosages of 120 mg/d). A tapering schedule was carried out during a 12-day stay in the hospital in which the diazepam dosage was reduced by a fixed quantity every day, corresponding to about ten percent of the initial dosage. Five days after discharge from the hospital the patient experienced panic attacks, for the first time, which continued until 13 days after discharge. By the 40th day, the patient was experiencing a major depressive episode, which improved after administration of clomipramine therapy. We suggest that a relatively quick withdrawal schedule (ten percent per day) is probably inadequate in preventing withdrawal reactions to long-acting benzodiazepines taken in high doses for an extended period of time.", 
    "40": "The inhibitory action of pirenzepine on acid secretion of isolated guinea pig parietal cells was investigated by the aminopyrine method. Pirenzepine markedly inhibited acid secretion of isolated parietal cells induced by carbachol in a dose-dependent manner but showed no inhibition on acid secretion stimulated by histamine.

    "41": "The metabolism of prazepam (7-chloro-1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1, 4-benzodiazepin-2-one) (PZ) was studied using liver microsomes prepared from untreated, phenobarbital (PB)-treated, and 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-treated male Sprague-Dawley rats. Relative rates of PZ metabolism by liver microsomes prepared from rats were PB-treated greater than untreated greater than 3MC-treated. Metabolites of PZ were separated by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography and the relative amounts of major metabolites were found to be N-desalkylprazepam (also known as N-desmethyldiazepam and nordiazepam) greater than 3-hydroxy-PZ (3-OH-PZ) greater than oxazepam. Enantiomers of 3-OH-PZ were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography on an analytical column packed with Pirkle's chiral stationary phase, (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine covalently bonded to spherical particles of gamma-aminopropylsilanized silica. 3-OH-PZ formed in the metabolism of PZ by liver microsomes prepared from rats was found to have 3R/3S enantiomer ratios of 84:16 (untreated), 85:15 (PB-treated), and 84:16 (3MC-treated), respectively. Relative rates of N-dealkylation of PZ by three rat liver microsomal preparations were PB-treated greater than untreated greater than 3MC-treated. N-Dealkylation of 3-OH-PZ by rat liver microsomes was substrate enantioselective; the 3S-enantiomer was N-dealkylated faster than the 3R-enantiomer. The results indicated that both C3-hydroxylation of PZ and N-dealkylation of 3-OH-PZ catalyzed by rat liver microsomes were stereoselective, resulting in the formation of a 3-OH-PZ highly enriched in the 3R-enantiomer.", 
    "42": "We describe here the properties of tert-butyloxycarbonyl-Trp-Leu-Asp-Phe-NHNH2 (A-57696), a C-terminal hydrazide analogue of tert-butyloxycarbonyl-CCK4 (Boc-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2), at four cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor-bearing tissues, the guinea pig pancreas and gall bladder (Type A), guinea pig cortex (Type B), and NCI-H345 cells, a human small cell lung cancer cell line that expresses CCK-B/gastrin receptors. Using 125I-Bolton-Hunter-cholecystokinin octapeptide (26-33) (125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK8) as the radioligand, A-57696 was found to be selective for cortical CCK-B receptors (IC50 = 25 nM), compared with pancreatic CCK-A receptors (IC50 = 15 microM). A-57696 behaved as a competitive antagonist in reversing CCK8-stimulated pancreatic amylase secretion and phosphoinositide breakdown. By Schild analysis, its Kd was determined to be 4.7 and 6.8 microM in amylase and phosphoinositide assays, respectively. A-57696 (100 microM) did not elicit gall bladder contraction, and it inhibited contractions induced by CCK8. The Kd of A-57696 at gall bladder CCK-A receptors was 19 microM. In contrast, A-57696 behaved as a partial agonist (80% of maximal CCK8 response) in stimulating calcium mobilization at CCK-B/gastrin receptors on NCI-H345 cells. A-57696 and CCK8 inhibited each other in calcium mobilization experiments utilizing the fluorescent dye Indo-1. Stimulatory actions of CCK8 and A-57696 were reversed by the CCK-B-selective (R)-L-365,260 (100 nM), whereas at the same concentration, the CCK-A-selective (S)-L-365,260 was ineffective. Binding studies using 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK8 and 125I-gastrin indicated that binding sites labeled by these two ligands displayed similar affinities for CCK8, desulfated CCK8, gastrin, A-57696, and both enantiomers of L-365,260. A-57696 represents a new class of CCK-A peptide antagonist at guinea pig pancreas a new class of CCK-A peptide antagonist at guinea pig pancreas and gall bladder. Its contrasting functional activities at guinea pig CCK-A and CCK-B/gastrin receptors in a human tumor cell demonstrate that, in addition to the previously described differences in binding specificity for selective agonists and antagonists, CCK-A receptors and CCK-B/gastrin receptors have different requirements for activation.", 
    "43": "Vasopressin mRNA in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the rat brain exhibits diurnal variation in poly(A) tail length; a single species of mRNA identical in size to that in other hypothalamic nuclei is expressed in the light phase of the daily cycle whereas a second, smaller species is expressed in the dark phase. We have investigated the neuroendocrine factors which may regulate this rhythm by comparing vasopressin mRNA size with Northern analysis of RNA extracted from SCN tissue taken at 09.00 h (light phase) and 21.00 h (dark phase). The consistent rhythmic variation observed in normal male rats was not modified in either adrenalectomized or castrated animals or in ovariectomized female rats. The rhythm was also not disrupted following treatment with the serotonin-depleting agent parachlorophenylalanine, or following treatment with either melatonin or the benzodiazepine, triazolam. We next investigated whether the daily pattern of expression was maintained in isolated SCN. Microdissected blocks containing the paired SCN were explanted into culture at various times of the day for a period of 4 h. Vasopressin mRNA extracted from light phase cultures (11.00-15.00 h) exhibited no size change from control SCN mRNA taken at either 11.00 h or 15.00 h. In contrast, mRNA from cultures maintained over the period 16.00-20.00 h (lights off: 18.00 h) exhibited a marked size difference from 16.00 h controls, being similar to the smaller species observed in 20.00 h controls. Similarly, vasopressin mRNA from cultures maintained over the period 05.00-09.00 h (lights on 06.00 h) was similar in size to 09.00 h controls and contrasted to the pattern of expression observed in 05.00 h controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Alcohol continues to play a major etiologic role in blunt trauma. It is involved in 65-70% of fatal highway crashes. The role of illicit drugs, although accepted as an etiologic factor in trauma, is less well described. This is especially true of blunt and penetrating trauma related to violent crime. During a 9-month period, in a randomly selected group, blood and urine samples were taken from 169 traumatized patients for alcohol and general toxicology screens. There were 81 cases (47.9%) related to violent crime. One hundred twenty-six patients (74.5%) tested positive for illicit or prescription drugs in their blood. These included cocaine (54.4%), cannabinoids (37.2%), barbiturates (7.1%), amphetamines (4.7%), benzodiazepines (10.1%), opiates (9%), and codeine (1%). Sixty-one patients (35.5%) tested positive for alcohol. Alcohol was found in 6.2% of violent crime-related cases. Illicit drugs were found in 80.3% of violent crime-related cases. Alcohol and drugs, especially illicit drugs, are major etiologic factors in both accidental and crime-related trauma in the urban population. All patients admitted to trauma centers, especially urban trauma centers, should be screened for alcohol and drugs.", 
    "45": "Sociocultural considerations and persistence of indiscriminate prescription habits for addicts may have contributed in shifting the pattern of misused drugs from traditional alcohol and illicit drugs to predominantly iatrogenic dependence on benzodiazepines. The clinical profile and the rationale for the long-adopted detoxification treatment of 120 patients were studied. Multiple-drug misusers were found to suffer significantly more anxiety-type symptoms suggestive of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Poor correlation of detoxification medication with patient variables suggests that such treatment lacks the rationale for its continuation and should be replaced by treatments based on proper physical and psychiatric evaluation. Benzodiazepine dependence should be recognized as a clinical entity requiring relevant treatment strategies.", 
    "46": "Both classical (atropine) and non-traditional (pirenzepine, metacine) antagonists of the muscarinic cholinoreceptors induce, rather than block, an intense and prolonged salivary response in chronically denervated human parotid glands and thus are capable of discriminating between neuronal and aneuronal receptors. Hexamethonium (benzohexonium) a ganglion-blocking agent (0.4 mL, 2.5%) completely inhibits this paradoxical salivation to atropine, benzilylcholine (metacine) and pirenzepine in the chronic preganglionically denervated human parotid gland. The authors discuss the essence of the revealed paradoxical phenomena.", 
    "47": "31 of 36 elderly mainly confused hospitalized patients (69-98 years) taking temazepam 10 mgs nocte for more than one month completed a double blind randomised placebo controlled trial comparing abrupt versus gradual withdrawal of temazepam. Hours of sleep were recorded for all patients during a 7 day baseline period while taking temazepam 10 mg nocte. Then the abrupt withdrawal (AW) group (n = 15) received placebo for 10 nights and the gradual withdrawal (GW) group (n = 16) received temazepam 5 mg for the first 4 nights, 2 mg for the next 4 nights and placebo for the last 2 nights. There was no significant difference in mean hours of nightly sleep during the baseline period between the AW group (5.9 +/- 1.1 SD) and GW group (5.8 +/- 1.1 SD) and between the baseline and withdrawal periods in each group (withdrawal periods, AW 5.6 +/- 1.2, GW 5.6 +/- 1.0). There was no rebound insomnia when temazepam was withdrawn either abruptly or gradually in long-term hospitalised elderly patients and may not be effective as a long-term hypnotic.", 
    "48": "Using rat and mouse models of aversive behaviour, we have further investigated the properties of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (GR38032F) that are relevant to its proposed use as an anxiolytic agent. Tolerance to the disinhibitory properties of diazepam was readily demonstrated in the social interaction test in the rat, but did not occur after subchronic treatment with ondansetron. In both the light/dark exploration test in mice and the social interaction test in rats, withdrawal from subchronic treatment with diazepam increased behavioural suppression, whereas this was not observed with ondansetron. The behavioural suppression and weight loss induced by either the withdrawal of diazepam or the administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, in animals treated subchronically with diazepam, was prevented or antagonised by diazepam or ondansetron. Buspirone was ineffective. It is concluded that, in rats and mice, tolerance to the disinhibitory effects of ondansetron does not occur, that withdrawal from subchronic treatment with ondansetron is not associated with any behavioural disturbances and that ondansetron is highly effective in preventing the behavioural suppression and weight loss following withdrawal from subchronic diazepam treatment. These data suggest that ondansetron may have major therapeutic advantages over currently available anxiolytic agents, particularly in patients who have previously received prolonged benzodiazepine therapy.", 
    "49": "Rats were trained to discriminate either CL218872 (5 mg/kg PO) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg PO) from vehicle in a 2-lever discrimination task on an FR20 schedule. The discriminative cues produced by these two drugs generalised to a range of benzodiazepine receptor agonists and partial agonists. Nitrazepam, diazepam, RU32698 and RU32514 were less potent in substituting for the CL218872 cue than the chloridiazepoxide cue. Zopiclone, RU31719 and RU43028 substituted for both cues with similar potency, whilst zolpidem and CL218872 were clearly more potent in substituting for the CL218872 cue. Chlordiazepoxide substituted only partially for the CL218872 cue, even at doses which decreased the rate of responding. CGS9896 substituted partially for both cues, but was less effective with the CL218872 cue. RU39419 substituted for the chlordiazepoxide cue, but antagonised the CL218872 cue. CGS8216 and FG7142 antagonised both cues. The contributions of benzodiazepine receptor subtypes or partial agonism to the generation of the CL218872 cue is discussed.", 
    "50": "In a general population survey by Gallup in Great Britain of 4148 subjects, 7.7% had taken benzodiazepines within the last year (male:female ratio 106:212). Younger subjects tended to take anxiolytics for shorter periods compared with older subjects, who often took hypnotics chronically. This pattern was most marked among females. Dosage escalation, tolerance, high daily dose usage, and hoarding were not common. A substantial proportion of current users had experienced difficulty in stopping their medication. Withdrawal problems were associated with being older than 45 years and consuming benzodiazepines for over 12 months. This lends support to the idea of benzodiazepine dependency. However, the appropriateness of long-term therapy for chronic symptoms cannot be ruled out.",

In contrast to all other treatments used so far by flumazenil hepatic encephalopathy improves within minutes. Flumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist which can be used in humans and is a well established for treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. For treatment of hepatic encephalopathy development of a new antagonist with a longer half-life is desirable. However, ut should be stressed that the current experience with flumazenil is limited and that the effects of flumazenil on hepatic encephalopathy is not proven by randomized controlled studies. Therefore, this drug should only be used in clinical studies.", 
    "52": "It has been shown previously that the endogenous brain peptide Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) can act as an antiopiate and can also increase binding and function at the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. We now describe the effects of this tetrapeptide in two models in which the antiopiate naloxone has been reported to decrease the activity of benzodiazepines. Unlike naloxone, Tyr-MIF-1 and MIF-1 neither prevented chlordiazepoxide-induced locomotor hyperactivity in mice on a tilting floor nor suppressed chlordiazepoxide-induced eating in rats. Thus, in these two systems, Try-MIF-1 did not act as an antiopiate or alter the effects of a benzodiazepine, indicating a selectivity in the actions of Tyr-MIF-1.", 
    "53": "The peptides MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) and Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) recently have been found to augment the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on benzodiazepine receptor binding and chloride channel binding (Tyr-MIF-1) at the GABAA receptor complex. To determine whether these peptides affect the function of this complex in chloride transport, we evaluated chloride uptake stimulated by the GABA analog muscimol in synaptoneurosome preparations. In mice treated with either MIF-1 or Tyr-MIF-1 (1 mg/kg IP), maximal chloride uptake in cortex was increased compared with controls. The two peptides had similar effects in cortical preparations, but in cerebellum neither peptide altered chloride uptake. No differences from controls were observed in cortical synaptoneurosomes treated in vitro with either MIF-1 or Tyr-MIF-1. These results suggest that the brain peptides MIF-1 and Tyr-MIF-1 alter function at the GABAA receptor complex, perhaps by binding at a specific peptide receptor.", 
    "54": "Recent observations on the steroid synthetic capability within the brain open the possibility that benzodiazepines may influence steroid synthesis in nervous tissue through interactions with peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites, which are highly expressed in steroidogenic cells and associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. To examine this possibility nine molecules that exhibit a greater than 10,000-fold difference in their affinities for peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites were tested for their effects on a well-established steroidogenic model system, the Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cell line. 4'-Chlorodiazepam, PK 11195, and PK 14067 stimulated steroid production by 2-fold in Y-1 cells, whereas diazepam, flunitrazepam, zolpidem, and PK 14068 displayed a lower (1.2- to 1.5-fold) maximal stimulation. In contrast, clonazepam and flumazenil did not stimulate steroid synthesis. The potencies of these compounds to inhibit 3H-labeled PK 11195 binding to peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites correlated (r = 0.985) with their potencies to stimulate steroid production. Similar findings were observed in bovine and rat adrenocortical cell preparations. These results suggest that ligands of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition site acting on this mitochondrial receptor can enhance steroid production. This action may contribute specificity to the pharmacological profile of drugs preferentially acting on the benzodiazepine recognition site associated with the outer membrane of certain mitochondrial populations.", 
    "55": "A benzodiazepine-neuroleptic adjunctive treatment strategy in a cohort of acutely manic patients was compared with standard neuroleptic adjunctive treatment in a matched sample treated in the same hospital. Thirty newly hospitalized manic patients receiving low-dose neuroleptic (310 mg/day chlorpromazine equivalents) and benzodiazepines (1.6 mg/day lorazepam equivalents) were compared, retrospectively, with 30 statistically similar patients receiving standard dose neuroleptic adjunctive treatment (590 mg/day chlorpromazine equivalents; 0.09 mg/day lorazepam equivalents). The benzodiazepine-neuroleptic-treated group demonstrated significantly fewer seclusion and restraint episodes (p less than .05) and were comparable on other parameters. Treatment with the benzodiazepine-neuroleptic combination may lead to fewer inpatient complications than standard neuroleptic treatment alone.",

Clonazepam may be a safe and effective treatment for neuroleptic-induced akathisia in this age group.", 
    "59": "Chronic use of benzodiazepines, the most widely prescribed of all psychotropic medicines, may lead to severe symptoms of withdrawal when the drugs are discontinued. The authors describe two cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal accompanied by unusual muscle activity. The neurologic mechanism for the motor abnormalities appears to be marked disinhibition of subcortical motor areas normally inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid. The motor phenomena may persist long after the more common signs of withdrawal have resolved and, if unrecognized, can lead to such misdiagnoses as drug seeking, conversion, hysteria, or malingering.", 
    "60": "The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a series of pyrazolo[b][1,5]benzodiazepines are described. Some of the 4-piperazinyl-2,10-dihydropyrazolo[3,4-b][1,5]benzodiazepine derivatives demonstrated potent anxiolytic activity in the three-part operant anticonflict test in rats. Compounds 21 and 30 were more active than the clinically effective anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide in releasing conflict-suppressed behavior. This study shows a dissociation of the anxiolytic and antidopaminergic activities found in the thieno- and dibenzodiazepine derivatives flumezapine and clozapine, respectively. Examples of the three other dihydropyrazolo[b][1,5]benzodiazepine ring systems are described and evaluated for comparison and were found to be less active.", 
    "61": "A series of 1-substituted 4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-carboxylic acid esters and amides were synthesized and screened for anxiolytic activity in the shock-induced suppression of drinking (SSD) test. The compounds were also tested for their ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) from brain benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites. Many compounds were active in these screens and, additionally, demonstrated a selectivity for the type 1 BZ (BZ1) receptor over the type 2 BZ (BZ2) receptor as indicated by Hill coefficients significantly less than unity and by analysis of [3H]FLU binding results from different brain regions. Based on the results of structure-activity studies of these compounds, a hypothesis was proposed to explain the structural features necessary for optimal interaction with brain BZ receptors. A detailed pharmacological evaluation of one of the most potent behaviorally active compounds (27) demonstrated it to be BZ1 selective; also, in comparison to diazepam, 27 showed minimal sedative and alcohol interactive properties at therapeutically effective doses.", 
    "62": "To compare the in vitro pharmacological effect and in the brain distribution of benzodiazepines and phenobarbital, three group of sixty anesthetized rats (470-480 g) were administered 5 microCi of 3H-diazepam, 3H-flunitrazepam or 3H-phenobarbital. The rats were decapitated 3, 10, or 40 minutes after the intravenous injection of these drugs. Radioactivity of the tissue was measured and calculated as d.p.m./g. tissue. 3H-diazepam radioactivity in the brain-stem and hypothalamus was significantly higher than in the brain cortex 3 and 10 minutes after the injection. 3H-flunitrazepam radioactivity in the brain cortex was higher than in other regions. There was no significant decrease in 3H-phenobarbital brain concentration, even 40 minutes after injection. The distribution of benzodiazepine is closely related with its pharmacological effect, and this suggests that in vitro benzodiazepine binding sites are not responsible for the pharmacological action in vivo.", 
    "63": "Two cDNAs (alpha 1 and alpha 4) from rat brain cDNA libraries encode isoforms of the alpha subunit of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor, which differ at 30% of their amino acid residues. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry show that alpha 1 and alpha 4 mRNAs have distinct sizes and distinct regional and cellular distributions in rat brain: both mRNAs are found in the cortex and hippocampus; however, only the alpha 1 mRNA is detected in the cerebellum. We injected RNA transcribed from alpha 1 and alpha 4 cDNAs into Xenopus oocytes, together with an RNA for a rat beta subunit. We obtained GABA-dependent inward currents that were reversibly blocked by picrotoxin. Picrotoxin alone, applied to oocytes producing the alpha and beta polypeptides, elicited an outward current. We suggest that these polypeptides together produce GABA-gated ion channels that can also open spontaneously.", 
    "64": "In an attempt to elucidate the physiological relevance of the peripheral type of benzodiazepine receptor in adrenocortical mitochondria, we examined the effect of three different benzodiazepines (diazepam, Ro5-4864, and chlordiazepoxide) on the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, by using cholesterol-loaded mitochondria from bovine adrenal zona fasciculata. These benzodiazepines, except chlordiazepoxide, caused a dose-dependent stimulation of the cholesterol side chain cleavage in the mitochondria. The stimulatory effect of Ro5-4864 was approximately 10 times more potent than that of diazepam. No inhibitory effect of YM-684 (Ro15-1788), a potent antagonist to central-type benzodiazepine receptors, was observed in the stimulation induced by diazepam and Ro5-4864. Both external calcium ion and voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker, (+)-PN200-110, were without effect on the diazepam-induced steroidogenesis. By contrast, pretreatment of mitochondria with digitonin abolished the stimulatory effect of diazepam on the mitochondrial steroidogenesis. The present results indicate that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor of adrenocortical mitochondria plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol side chain cleavage without any change of calcium channels.", 
    "65": "In this study the expression of voltage-dependent calcium channels on osteoclast plasma membrane has been investigated. We found that osteoclasts were sensitive to KCl-induced depolarization. In this circumstance a 4 fold transient cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) increase was observed. This increase was dose-dependent. Its half maximal effect was achieved at 30 mM KCl. Voltage sensitive calcium channels in osteoclasts were inhibited by specific antagonists. Nicardipine, a dihydropyridine derivative, was the most effective, inducing complete block of the channels at 10(-6) M. Verapamil (phenylalkylamine) and diltiazem (benzodiazepine) were less effective. These results are consistent with the presence, on the osteoclast membrane, of L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels.", 
    "66": "Young adult CD-1 male mice were housed in individual cages throughout the study. Groups of 10 to 20 mice were given gradually increasing doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at 6.25 to 25 mg/kg i.p., trifluoperazine (TFP) at 6 to 12 mg/kg p.o., phenobarbital sodium (PS) at 20 to 35 mg/kg p.o., morphine sulfate (MS) at 5 to 20 mg/kg i.p., methaqualone (MQ) 10 to 20 mg/kg p.o. or chlordiazepoxide (CDP) 10 to 25 mg/kg p.o. over four to six weeks to develop tolerance of these drugs. Following the development of tolerance, the drugs were withdrawn. On the fourth day of withdrawal, a young (3-4 weeks old) male mouse was introduced into the cage. When the intensity of the attack was measured by the percentage of animals that killed the intruder within four hours. The results indicated 0 to 4 percent in the controls, 50-54 percent for THC, 50 percent for TFP, 42 percent for PS and 57 percent for MS. In contrast, no killing behavior was exhibited by these mice after treatment with MQ or CDP. These data suggest that enhanced aggressive behavior, elicited by withdrawal from certain psychotropic drugs, may be measured by the killing (muricidal) behavior of isolated mice.", 
    "67": "The inbred mouse strains BALB/cBy (C) and C57BL/6By (B6) differed significantly in their susceptibility to seizures induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM). Following a 5 mg/kg injection of beta-CCM, 74% of C (n = 35) and 13% of B6 (n = 40) mice exhibited a convulsion. No sex difference was found. Analysis of the reciprocal F1s failed to show either maternal environmental and/or heterosomal effects. A genetic analysis of the strain difference in susceptibility to beta-CCM-induced seizures using recombinant inbred strains (RIS) was performed. The strain distribution for the RIS showed a two group partition. Statistical analysis showed that, although a one-segregating-unit model could not be rejected to explain the strain difference in beta-CCM-induced seizures, some of the evidence weakened the one-segregating-unit hypothesis.", 
    "68": "Observing animal models of fulminant hepatic failure lead to the hypothesis of a GABAergic origin of the comatose state in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The hypothesis of hyperstimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABA-BZ) receptors in HE has been tested with a BZ antagonist (flumazenil, Anexate) on 7 patients suffering from severe HE. The standard EEG has been recorded 30 min before and after slow IV perfusion of 1 mg flumazenil. Although we did not observe a complete EEG normalization, a significant improvement of EEG was observed after only a few minutes in 6 out of the 7 cases studied. Modification of the reactivity parallels clinical improvement of encephalopathy. These effects persist mostly 4 h after perfusion. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of hyperstimulation of GABA-BZ receptors in HE. The positive effect of flumazenil on vigilance level should encourage its use in chronic hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "69": "Human gliomas were imaged in vivo using ligands for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site (or omega 3 binding site) and positron emission tomography (PET). Although gliomas have a high density of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, PET scans with a selective ligand for this site, [11C] Ro5-4864, failed to demonstrate higher radioactivity levels in human gliomas than in brain. In vitro studies of surgically removed specimens of human glioma demonstrated little binding of Ro5-4864 but high levels of binding of another selective ligand, PK 11195. Scans with [11C]PK 11195 demonstrated increased radioactivity in glioma compared to brain in 8 of 10 patients. Radioactivity in tumor and the ratios of radioactivity in tumor to that in remote gray and in white matter correlated significantly with the specific activity of [11C]PK 11195, suggesting that accumulation represents saturable high-affinity binding. We conclude that the PK 11195 manifests greater binding than Ro5-4864 to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site on human gliomas and that human gliomas can be successfully imaged using [11C]PK 11195 and PET.", 
    "70": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors contain a region encompassing the second and third transmembrane domains that is rich in conserved aspartic acid residues. To investigate the role of four conserved aspartic acids at positions 71, 99, 105, and 122 in muscarinic receptor function, point mutations in the rat m1 muscarinic receptor gene were made that converted each Asp to Asn, and wild type or mutant genes were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that normally lack muscarinic receptors. Substitution of Asp71 or Asp122 with Asn produced mutant receptors that displayed high affinity for carbachol but decreased efficacy and potency, respectively, in agonist-induced activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, suggesting that these residues may mediate receptor-GTP binding protein interactions. Substitution of Asp99 or Asp105 with Asn produced marked decreases in ligand binding affinities and/or covalent incorporation of [3H] propylbenzilylcholine mustard, suggesting that these residues may be involved in receptor-ligand interactions.", 
    "71": "Based on the reversal of hepatic encephalopathy in animal models with administration of specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, it has been postulated that this syndrome may be mediated by an endogenous benzodiazepine-like compound. In this study using a radio-receptor assay, evidence for the existence of this substance has been demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid but not sera of rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy due to galactosamine-induced hepature failure. Cerebrospinal fluid from rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy caused 36.1 +/- 5.03% displacement of 3H-Ro 15-1788 specific binding to cortical benzodiazepine receptors, compared to 11.7 +/- 0.76% in control animals (P less than 0.01). The benzodiazepine receptor binding activity has been shown to behave as a competitive inhibitor of radiolabeled benzodiazepine receptor binding. The finding of endogenous benzodiazepine binding activity affords a potential explanation for the amelioration of hepatic encephalopathy in this model with the administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists.", 
    "72": "Several optically active N-(indol-3-ylglyoxylyl)amino acid derivatives were synthesized and tested for [3H]flunitrazepam displacing activity in bovine brain membranes. IC50 values were measured and revealed that the D form of the amino acid moiety of the compounds was more potent than both the L form and racemic form, suggesting a key role of the amino acid stereochemistry on the affinity to the benzodiazepine receptors. GABA ratio and proconvulsant/convulsant data reported for the most active compounds reveal they behave as inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "73": "The relationship between the quantitative EEG variables and plasma levels after the administration of diazepam (DZ) or N-desmethyldiazepam (synthesized NDDZ) was evaluated by simultaneously measuring the power spectra for EEG with two biological markers and plasma concentrations. After a single DZ administration, the EEG change corresponding to sedation appeared rapidly and showed a short duration. A close relationship was found between these effects and changes in the DZ plasma concentrations. DZ and synthesized NDDZ had the same pharmacodynamic characteristics, but the main metabolic product of DZ (metabolite NDDZ) showed a different pharmacokinetic profile. A multiple administration of DZ or synthesized NDDZ caused some reduction in sedation at the steady-state. These results led to the conclusions that a single administration of DZ causes sedation of a short duration, and the main metabolic product of DZ (metabolite NDDZ) does not seem to contribute to sedation. In addition, the reduction in the pharmacological effect after continuous treatment with DZ depends not on autoinduction or interference, but on acute tolerance or adaptation.", 
    "74": "Mice fed chronically (3 to 4 weeks) a liquid diet containing chlordiazepoxide (CDP) became physically dependent on the drug as demonstrated by the occurrence of withdrawal signs precipitated by injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 (5 to 25 mg/kg) or by omitting CDP from the diet (spontaneous withdrawal). Very low blood concentrations of CDP, but medium to high levels of the active metabolites N-desmethyl CDP and demoxepam were found during the period of CDP administration. The Ro15-1788-induced withdrawal signs appeared within 1 min after the injection of the antagonist and lasted for at least 10 min. Quantifiable withdrawal signs included tail lift, tremor, impaired movement and handling-induced seizures. Mice undergoing spontaneous withdrawal had milder withdrawal signs such as weight loss, in appetite and suppression of runway and head-dipping activities on day 1 or day 2 of withdrawal. These signs were also present in Ro15-1788-induced withdrawal. A long-lasting rebound increase in runway and head-dipping activities occurred several days after CDP withdrawal.", 
    "75": "Four mg of lorazepam was given intravenously 5 min prior to thiopental anaesthesia in 5 clinically healthy dogs weighing 14 +/- 2 kg and aged about 10-12 months. Animals required only 7.0 +/- 1.5 ml of 5% thiopental sodium to achieve surgical anaesthesia which lasted about 30.4 +/- 3.3 minutes. There was adequate muscle relaxation and loss of pedal and palpebral reflexes. Five min after administration of lorazepam, there was no appreciable change in various cardiopulmonary dynamics. However, there was moderate arterial hypertension, tachycardia and arterial hypoxemia 15 min after the onset of the thiopental anaesthesia. There was no respiratory depression. The lorazepam-thiopental combination was also attempted in 16 clinical cases varying from repair of fractures of long bones (9), mammary tumour (2), ear haematoma (1), ear cropping (1), tail gangrene (2) and rectal prolapse (1). This combination of anaesthesia proved extremely useful for orthopaedic surgery as the muscle relaxation was adequate and reduction of the fractured ends was comparatively easier.", 
    "76": "Polysomnograms were recorded of twelve patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) during different stages in an open design. During the first night no hypnotics were administered, during the second night 30 mg flurazepam per os were given. Flurazepam affected mainly the NREM parameters. The times \"awake\" during the night were reduced, sleep stage 2 showed an increase, and the effective sleep time was also increased. The increase in sleep spindle density was remarkable, however, delta sleep and generation of K-complexes were not affected. Flurazepam did not affect REM sleep at all. The amount of REM sleep showed a slight increase. REM distribution during the night did not show the \"bell shaped\" increase and the decrease in the morning; the degree of the illness correlated with a flattening of REM distribution.", 
    "77": "1. Rates of protein synthesis were measured, in vivo, in lung, liver, heart and skeletal muscle of young male rats. Groups of rats were exposed for 1 h duration to one of the following anaesthetic regimens: 1.4% halothane, 2.2% halothane, 1.4% halothane in 66% nitrous oxide, intravenous pentobarbitone (20 mg/kg) and intravenous midazolam (18 mg/kg) combined with fentanyl (2 micrograms/kg). Fractional rates of protein synthesis were determined by injecting [3H]phenylalanine (150 mumol/100 g body weight). 2. Liver protein synthesis was depressed significantly by all regimens, except midazolam/fentanyl, by up to 37.7% of control values. Lung protein synthesis was significantly reduced by all the anaesthetic agents by up to 30% of control rates. 3. The effects of the anaesthetic agents on skeletal muscle and heart were small and not statistically significant. 4. There was no evidence of ventilatory depression as manifested by changes in arterial blood gas partial pressures of CO2 and O2, except in the group treated with 2.2% halothane.", 
    "78": "Colonoscopy is a common procedure, usually performed in a hospital setting. Hospital backup is desirable for high-risk patients, but the cost to benefit ratio may be unnecessarily high for low-risk patients. The demand for colonoscopic examinations is escalating, and cost containment has become an important issue. One way to reduce the cost is to eliminate the hospital component by performing the examination in the office. Over the past two and a half years, colonoscopy was performed on selected patients in the authors' office. Five hundred fifty-four office colonoscopies were performed to date, including biopsy or polypectomy in 348. Basic principles of safe intravenous sedation and colonoscopy were followed strictly. The cecum was reached in 92 percent of cases, and no significant complications were encountered. Office colonoscopy is a safe alternative to hospital colonoscopy. It confers significant cost savings to the patient and allows more efficient use of the physician's time."
