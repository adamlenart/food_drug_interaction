    "5": "Diazepam is a benzodiazepine with several clinical uses, including the management of anxiety, insomnia, muscle spasms, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal. The clinical response to benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, varies widely between individuals (1, 2). Diazepam is primarily metabolized by CY2C19 and CYP3A4 to the major active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam. Approximately 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians have reduced or absent CYP2C19 enzyme activity (\u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d). In these individuals, standard doses of diazepam may lead to a higher exposure to diazepam. The FDA-approved drug label for diazepam states that \u201cThe marked inter-individual variability in the clearance of diazepam reported in the literature is probably attributable to variability of CYP2C19 (which is known to exhibit genetic polymorphism; about 3-5% of Caucasians have little or no activity and are \u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d) and CYP3A4\u201d (1).", 
    "6": "Despite the availability of multiple antiepileptic drugs (AED), failure to adequately control seizures is a challenge for approximately one third of epilepsy patients, and new therapies with a differentiated mechanism of action are needed. The neuroactive steroid, SGE-516, is a positive allosteric modulator of both gamma- and delta-containing GABAA receptors. This broad GABAA receptor activity differentiates neuroactive steroids like SGE-516 from benzodiazepines, a class of anticonvulsants which have been shown in vitro to selectively target gamma-subunit containing GABAA receptors. As a neuroactive steroid, SGE-516 has pharmacokinetic properties that are intended to allow for chronic oral dosing. We investigated the anticonvulsant activity of SGE-516 across numerous in vitro and in vivo models of seizure activity. SGE-516 dose-dependently reduced neuronal firing rates and epileptiform activity in vitro. In mice, SGE-516 protected against acute seizures in the PTZ-induced chemo-convulsant seizure model and the 6Hz psychomotor seizure model. In addition, SGE-516 demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in the mouse corneal kindling model. These data suggest that SGE-516 may have potential for development as a novel oral AED for the treatment of refractory seizures.",

Mechanistic experiments revealed that pyridinium zwitterions act as 1,5-dipoles in [5 + 2] cycloadditions with arynes for the construction of 1,4-benzodiazepines, which further undergo [2 + 2] cycloaddition resulting in the one-pot formation of one C-N bond and three C-C bonds.", 
    "8": "Substance use among pregnant women is a major public health issue. Both prescription opioid use and illicit opioid abuse have increased dramatically in recent years. Prolonged in utero drug exposure may result in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), an acute multisystemic clinical entity that occurs in the first days of life. This syndrome is caused by abrupt discontinuation of fetal exposure to licit or illicit drugs chronically consumed by the mother during pregnancy and transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. It usually requires prolonged hospitalization and may have long-term effects. The interplay of many factors contributes to its clinical heterogeneity, and its pathophysiology has not been fully unveiled. The first step in NAS management consists of nonpharmacologic interventions and includes promoting breastfeeding when not contraindicated. If withdrawal signs become severe, pharmacotherapy is needed. The Finnegan scoring system supports care providers across the pharmacotherapy process from initiation through the monitoring phase, until weaning and discontinuation. However, a standardized approach to pharmacotherapy is still lacking. Morphine is usually the first-line agent to treat NAS. Methadone is a valid option, but its safety profile is not completely known. Phenobarbital, despite its lack of effect on gastrointestinal symptoms and unfavorable pharmacologic features, has been identified as a second-line agent to be used in infants unresponsive to opiates. Although buprenorphine and clonidine seem promising, their use requires further validation. Long-term developmental effects of NAS therapy call for more-comprehensive, longitudinal assessments. In this article, key points for use of recommended therapies are outlined, and directions for future research are suggested.",

Conventional treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical creams, such as nitroglycerin and nifedipine, and surgery. However, these treatments are usually suboptimally efficacious or have deterring side effects.Patients at an outpatient community center with a diagnosis of a chronic anal fissure were prescribed either topical 2% (n\u200a=\u200a19) or 4% (n\u200a=\u200a18) diazepam cream between January 2013 and February 2015. We retrospectively analyzed their responses to treatment.All 19 patients using 2% diazepam cream experienced a positive response in pain, whereas 47.4% experienced a complete response, with a numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 0 (0-10). Eighty-eight percent of patients using 4% dose had a positive response in pain, whereas 23.5% experienced a complete response. Ninety-four percent of patients using 2% dose had a positive response in anal bleeding, whereas 68.8% experienced a complete response with an anal bleeding score (ABS) of 2 (2-9). Ninety-four percent of patients using 4% dose had a positive response in anal bleeding, whereas 64.7% experienced a complete response. Only 1 patient reported a side effect from diazepam cream-perianal pruritus.Both 2% and 4% topical diazepam provided significant pain and bleeding relief from chronic anal fissures that were refractory to conventional therapies.

This paper uses a biopsychosocial framework to examine co-occurring mental health problems, victimization, substance dependence, sexual risk and physical pain among a sample of young women who use drugs (N = 222) in Miami's club scene. The majority of women were under 24 years old, Hispanic, and identified as heterosexual.

Women who had SMI had higher odds of substance dependence, concurrent physical pain, three or more sexual partners in the past 90 days, childhood victimization and severe abuse-related trauma. The high levels of interconnected mental health, victimization, trauma, physical pain, substance dependence and sexual risk factors observed are underreported in the literature, as young women club scene participants appear to be more similar to other marginalized drug-involved populations than previously considered.

    "178": "By rapidly modulating neuronal excitability, neurosteroids regulate physiological processes, such as responses to stress and development. Excessive stress affects their biosynthesis and causes an imbalance in cognition and emotions. The progesterone derivative, allopregnanolone (Allo) enhances extrasynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition by directly binding at GABAA receptors, and thus, positively and allosterically modulates the function of GABA. Allo levels are decreased in stress-induced psychiatric disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and elevating Allo levels may be a valid therapeutic approach to counteract behavioural dysfunction. While benzodiazepines are inefficient, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) represent the first choice treatment for depression and PTSD. Their mechanisms to improve behaviour in preclinical studies include neurosteroidogenic effects at low non-serotonergic doses. Unfortunately, half of PTSD and depressed patients are resistant to current prescribed \"high\" dosage of these drugs that engage serotonergic mechanisms. Unveiling novel biomarkers to develop more efficient treatment strategies is in high demand. Stress-induced downregulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis and changes in GABAA receptor subunit expression offer a putative biomarker axis to develop new PTSD treatments. The advantage of stimulating Allo biosynthesis relies on the variety of neurosteroidogenic receptors to be targeted, including TSPO and endocannabinoid receptors. Furthermore, stress favours a GABAA receptor subunit composition with higher sensitivity for Allo. The use of synthetic analogues of Allo is a valuable alternative. Pregnenolone or drugs that stimulate its levels increase Allo but also sulphated steroids, including pregnanolone sulphate which, by inhibiting NMDA tonic neurotransmission, provides neuroprotection and cognitive benefits. In this review we describe current knowledge on the effects of stress on neurosteroid biosynthesis and GABAA receptor neurotransmission and summarize available pharmacological strategies that by enhancing neurosteroidogenesis are relevant for the treatment of SSRI-resistant patients.",

Its efficacy in patients with schizophrenia was similar and sometimes even better than the efficacy of other long-acting drugs, such as risperidone or olanzapine. In the pharmacoeconomic studies, paliperidone proved to be cost-effective in comparison to risperidone or olanzapine. The review of the literature also underlined that paliperidone palmitate is well tolerated, compared with placebo.

The \u03b11-, \u03b22,3- and \u03b32- subunits which combine to form a benzodiazepine sensitive GABAA receptor showed the most intense levels of staining and were the most common subunits found throughout the human thalamus especially in the ventral and posterior nuclear groups. The next most intense staining was for the \u03b13-subunit followed by the \u03b12-subunit. The intralaminar nuclear group, the mediodorsal nucleus and the thalamic reticular nucleus contained \u03b11-, \u03b22,3- and \u03b32- subunits staining as well as the highest levels of the \u03b12- and \u03b13- subunits. The sensory dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus contained very high levels of \u03b11- and \u03b22,3- and \u03b32-subunits. The highest densities of GABAA receptors found throughout the thalamus which contained the subunits \u03b11, \u03b22,3, and \u03b32 included nuclei which are especially involved in the control or the modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuits and are thus important in disorders such as Huntington's disease where the GABAergic projections of the basal ganglia are compromised. In addition the majority of receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus contain \u03b13 and \u03b32 subunits whilst the intralaminar nuclei contain high levels of \u03b12 and \u03b13 subunits.",

    "200": "When treating a patient with SE, the main goals are to halt seizure activity, prevent further seizures, identify the cause of the seizures, and manage any complications. The veterinary literature indicates that benzodiazepines are the most common class of drugs used for the initial treatment of SE. Although many anticonvulsant drugs are currently available for treatment of SE, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating clear benefit to the use of specific therapeutics for benzodiazepine-refractory SE. Several multicenter, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trials are currently investigating the efficacy of new drugs, such as fosphenytoin, for use in canine SE. Another active area of research is the investigation of nonpharmacologic methods of seizure treatment including percutaneous vagal nerve stimulation and transcranial ultrasonic neuromodulation.", 
    "201": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is underutilized in the management of veterinary seizure disorders. However, recent advances in EEG technology may allow for earlier and proactive therapeutic interventions in epileptic patients, provide objective data collection regarding treatment efficacy, and yield insight into the neurologic status of patients with SE. Most importantly, use of EEG in patients with SE will lead to increased recognition of nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive SE.", 
    "202": "Mortality associated with SE is as high as 25% in dogs due to direct and indirect causes of death. Dogs with seizure disorders have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population, and epileptic dogs with SE have a significantly abbreviated lifespan compared to epileptics that do not experience SE. In people, nonconvulsive SE has a higher morbidity and mortality than convulsive SE, regardless of patient age or underlying diagnosis.", 
    "203": "We report a comparative study on the photodegradation of the widely used benzodiazepine psychoactive drug alprazolam (8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine, ALP) using direct photolysis, and titanium dioxide photocatalyzed reaction. Titanium dioxide photocatalysts were prepared as nanoparticles by acidic sol-gel methods, calcined at two different temperatures, and their behavior compared with P25 (Degussa type) TiO2. Efficient photodegradation was observed in the photocatalytic process, with over 90% degradation after 90 minutes under optimized conditions. Triazolaminoquinoline, 5-chloro-(5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)benzophenone, triazolbenzophenone, and \u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam were identified as the degradation products by fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC-MS. A comparison with the literature suggests that 8H-alprazolam may also be formed. Good mineralization was observed with TiO2 photocatalysts. ALP photodegradation with TiO2 follows pseudo-first order kinetics, with rates depending on the photocatalyst used. The effects of the quantity of the photocatalyst and concentration of alprazolam were studied.", 
    "204": "The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) plays an important role in xenobiotic metabolism, energy homeostasis, and cell proliferation. Antagonism of the CAR represents a key strategy for studying its function and may have potential clinical applications. However, specific human CAR (hCAR) antagonists are limited and conflicting data on the activity of these compounds have been reported. 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195), a typical peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, has been established as a potent hCAR deactivator in immortalized cells; whether it inhibits hCAR activity under physiologically relevant conditions remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of PK11195 on hCAR in metabolically competent human primary hepatocytes (HPH) and HepaRG cells. We show that although PK11195 antagonizes hCAR in HepG2 cells, it induces the expression of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, targets of hCAR and the pregnane X receptor (PXR), in HPH, HepaRG, and PXR-knockout HepaRG cells. Utilizing a HPH-HepG2 coculture model, we demonstrate that inclusion of HPH converts PK11195 from an antagonist to an agonist of hCAR, and such conversion was attenuated by potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole. Metabolically, we show that the N-desmethyl metabolite is responsible for PK11195-mediated hCAR activation by facilitating hCAR interaction with coactivators and enhancing hCAR nuclear translocation in HPHs. Structure-activity analysis revealed that N-demethylation alters the interaction of PK11195 with the binding pocket of hCAR to favor activation. Together, these results indicate that removal of a methyl group switches PK11195 from a potent antagonist of hCAR to an agonist in HPH and highlights the importance of physiologically relevant metabolism when attempting to define the biologic action of small molecules.", 
    "205": "The translocator protein (TSPO) is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein involved in the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria, which is the first step for the synthesis of steroid hormones, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and apoptosis. Studies have shown that the activation of TSPO may promote neuroprotective actions in experimental models of neurodegeneration and brain injury. In a previous study, our group showed that 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-CD), a TSPO ligand, was neuroprotective against amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate if 4'-CD was also neuroprotective against A\u03b2 in organotypic hippocampal cultures and to identify its mechanisms of action. A\u03b2 decreased the cell viability of organotypic hippocampal cultures, while 4'-CD had a neuroprotective effect when administered at 100nM and 1000nM. The neuroprotective effects of 4'-CD against A\u03b2 were associated with an increased expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD). No differences were found in the expression of catalase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Akt and procaspase-3. In summary, our results show that 4'-CD is neuroprotective against A\u03b2 by a mechanism involving the modulation of SOD protein expression.",

Unfortunately, there is no validated tool in common practice to assess whether sufficient cognitive recovery has occurred after DSP with BZDs to ensure patient memory of the assessment.", 
    "207": "The aim of the study was to identify cognitive functions and markers which predict preserved memory of the mental health care plan proposed at the emergency department after DSP.",

    "211": "Objective: To explore clinical characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of a family with childhood-onset rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP) caused by ATP1A3 gene mutation and review literatures. Method: The clinical data of a RDP child, his brother and mother had been analyzed retrospectively. This family was admitted to Xiangya Hospital in January 2016. DNA samples were analyzed by the next-generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Related literature from PubMed, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), CNKI and Wanfang databases to date (up to October 2016) with\"Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism\"RDP\"DYT12\" as key words was reviewed. Result: The proband boy was three years and four months old (April 2015) when he had the first attack of the disease. After a febricity, he suddenly acquired acute aphasia and limb movement disorder. Rehabilitation therapy and supportive treatment made his speech gradually recovered but still slurred. However, his abnormal walking posture still existed. Nine months later (January 2016, 4 years and one months old), symptoms including aphasia, dysphagia, and weakness with rostrocaudal gradient reoccured after fever. The disease progressed to the critical condition within 24 hours. He\"seizured\" four times with tonic spasms of limbs but without loss of consciousness. Family history showed his grandparents were consanguineous marriage. His mother and brother also developed abnormal gait and dysarthria after an infection before primary school age. Their symptoms improved gradually without relapsing. However, they did not recover entirely with mild intellectual disability. His mother had a healthy brother and sister. This proband had no other siblings but the brother. Heterozygous missense mutation p. R756H in ATP1A3 gene was detected in this proband, his mother and his brother. This mutation had been reported pathogenically related to RDP, and it located in highly conserved gene region. Benzodiazepine was used for the proband and his brother, with the proband being improved better although not completely. Meanwhile, benzodiazepine had no significant effect on his mother because of poor compliance. This is the first case report of RDP in China. The mutations of ATP1A3 have been previously reported in 51 patients including 6 large families and 16 other unrelated patients. A total of 14 different mutations in ATP1A3 gene with RDP have been reported to date, including 12 missense mutations, a 3-bp in-frame deletion, and a 3-bp in-frame insertion. The sporadic cases all had the typical clinical phenotypes of RDP, such as the abrupt onset of dysarthria, dysphagia, limb dystonia with bradykinesia, and postural instability. The symptoms of bulbar and arms were much more obvious. It was hard to diagnose RDP in a family because some patients had typical symptoms of RDP, while the others might experience from mild symptoms to no symptoms, which might be related to incomplete penetrance of RDP. Two cases carrying the same mutation as our patients also presented some overlapping phenotypes. Conclusion: The p. R756H heterozygous mutation in ATP1A3 gene is the pathogenic mutation of RDP, analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations of RDP will be very important and meaningful.",

Physiologic and behavioral variables were assessed and blood samples collected for determination of plasma midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam (primary midazolam metabolite) concentrations immediately before (baseline) and at predetermined times for 1,440 minutes after midazolam administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by compartmental and noncompartmental methods. RESULTS Following IV administration, midazolam was rapidly and extensively distributed and rapidly eliminated; mean \u00b1 SD apparent volume of distribution, elimination half-life, clearance, and area under the concentration-time curve were 838 \u00b1 330 mL/kg, 0.79 \u00b1 0.44 hours, 1,272 \u00b1 310 mL/h/kg, and 423 \u00b1 143 h\u00b7ng/mL, respectively. Following IM administration, midazolam was rapidly absorbed and bioavailability was high; mean \u00b1 SD maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration-time curve, and bioavailability were 820 \u00b1 268 ng/mL, 0.46 \u00b1 0.26 hours, 1,396 \u00b1 463 h\u00b7ng/mL, and 352 \u00b1 148%, respectively. Respiratory rate was transiently decreased from baseline for 15 minutes after IV administration. Times to peak sedation and ataxia after IV administration were less than those after IM administration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated midazolam was a suitable short-duration sedative for sheep, and IM administration may be a viable alternative when IV administration is not possible.", 
    "214": "Increased abuse of opioids is contributing to an escalation in overdose deaths. Benzodiazepines are frequently abused with opioids, possibly because they increase the potency and/or effectiveness of opioids to produce reinforcing effects. This study used a concurrent-choice procedure to determine whether monkeys would choose to self-administer a mixture of the opioid remifentanil and the benzodiazepine midazolam over remifentanil alone. Initially, three monkeys could respond on one lever for saline and on a second lever for either remifentanil alone or midazolam alone. Thereafter, monkeys chose between a dose of remifentanil (0.32 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) that did not change and a dose of remifentanil that varied across sessions; for some sessions, midazolam was combined with varying doses of remifentanil. All monkeys received more infusions of remifentanil (0.0032-0.32 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) than saline, whereas only two monkeys responded more for midazolam than for saline. When 0.32 \u00b5g/kg/infusion remifentanil was available on one lever and a dose of remifentanil that varied across sessions (0.1-1 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) was available on the other lever, monkeys chose the larger dose. Combining 3.2 \u00b5g/kg/infusion midazolam with 0.32 \u00b5g/kg/infusion remifentanil increased responding for the mixture over 0.32 \u00b5g/kg/infusion remifentanil alone, although monkeys chose remifentanil alone over mixtures containing smaller doses of remifentanil. When 10 \u00b5g/kg/infusion midazolam was combined with 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/infusion remifentanil, monkeys chose the mixture over 0.32 \u00b5g/kg/infusion remifentanil alone. Thus, monkeys prefer some opioid/benzodiazepine mixtures to larger doses of the opioid alone, suggesting that opioid/benzodiazepine coabuse might be due to increased potency (and possibly effectiveness) of opioids to produce reinforcing effects.", 
    "215": "Inhibitory A type \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating various brain functions and represent an important molecular target in neurological and psychiatric diseases, necessitating the need for the discovery and development of novel modulators. Here, we show that a natural compound curcumol, acts as an allosteric enhancer of GABAARs in a manner distinct from benzodiazepines. Curcumol markedly facilitated GABA-activated currents and shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the left in cultured hippocampal neurons. When co-applied with the classical benzodiazepine diazepam, curcumol further potentiated GABA-induced currents. In contrast, in the presence of a saturating concentration of menthol, a positive modulator for GABAAR, curcumol failed to further enhance GABA-induced currents, suggesting shared mechanisms underlying these two agents on GABAARs. Moreover, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil did not alter the enhancement of GABA response by curcumol and menthol, but abolished that by DZP. Finally, mutations at the \u03b22 or \u03b32 subunit predominantly eliminated modulation of recombinant GABAARs by curcumol and menthol, or diazepam, respectively. Curcumol may therefore exert its actions on GABAARs at sites distinct from benzodiazepine sites. These findings shed light on the future development of new therapeutics drugs targeting GABAARs.",

However, the brain uptake of individual SR flavones and its relationship to the elicited effects after SR administration remain unknown. Moreover, previous studies seldom measured pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes simultaneously. In the current study, the brain uptake of six major SR flavones and the anxiolytic behavior following oral administration of a SR extract at two clinically relevant doses (600 and 1200 mg/kg twice daily) were simultaneously investigated in mice (n = 18 per group). Brain and plasma concentrations of the flavones were measured by LC-MS/MS, while the anxiolytic effect was evaluated using the elevated plus maze. To further investigate the mechanism behind the differential brain uptake of the six SR flavones, these flavones were separately administered to mice at an equivalent molar oral dose (n = 6). The brain tissue bindings of the SR flavones were also measured with the in vitro brain slice method. Our results indicated that all six SR flavones including three aglycons (baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A) and three glucuronides (baicalin, wogonoside, and oroxyloside) could pass through the blood-brain barrier, with brain concentrations ranging from 7.9 to 224.0 pmol/g. It provided novel evidence that oroxylin A had the highest brain uptake among the six SR flavones regardless of its limited content in SR extract, in which 3.6-3.9% of the administered oroxylin A dose was present in the brain 6 h postdosing and with a brain-to-plasma ratio of 0.42-0.46. Although SR extract contains flavones that are positive modulators of the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors (baicalein, wogonin, and baicalin), our behavioral study for the first time indicated that SR extract (a mixture of six flavones) did not elicit significant anxiolytic effect at the studied doses. Oroxylin A also demonstrated the highest brain uptake when the six flavones were separately administered to mice, and the highest affinity to brain tissues in the in vitro tissue binding assay. The high brain uptake of oroxylin A, a GABAA antagonist which had been reported to antagonize diazepam-induced anxiolytic effect, might have suppressed the anxiolytic effects of the other flavones and account for the lack of overall anxiolytic effect of SR extract. The current study illustrates the importance of monitoring pharmacokinetics in a behavioral study, particularly for herbal medicines which consist of multiple components that might have different or even opposite pharmacological effects on the same target.",

    "268": "Olanzapine (OLZ) is a drug that is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses, and it belongs to the thienobenzodiazepine class. The OLZ molecule has low solubility decreasing bioavailability, but has high permeability in membrane biological being classified as a Class II drug substance according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. It was reported many side effects of administering OLZ orally. So, in order to increase the bioavailability of drug and possibly reducing some of side effects, this paper proposes a new material able to controllably release the drug in the body. To control the dissolution rate, this work proposes a system that incorporates the drug into montmorillonite (MMT) dispersed in a mixture of alginate (ALG) and xanthan gum (XG) biopolymers. The proposed hybrids and bionanocomposites were characterized by several physicochemical techniques, including XRD, IR-ATR, TG DTA, SEM-EDS and HPLC. The characterization data confirmed the intercalation of the OLZ into the MMT by the ion exchange process, as well as the interaction of the MMT-OLZ with the biopolymers. The release test, conducted under various pH conditions, showed that the proposed system exhibited a more controlled drug release than commercial tablets, indicating that the ALG-XG/MMT-OLZ bionanocomposite can act as a controlled release system for OLZ.", 
    "269": "The present study illustrates the application of the concept of Quality by Design for development, optimization and evaluation of Lorazepam loaded microemulsion containing ion responsive In situ gelator gellan gum and carbopol 934. A novel approach involving interactions between surfactant and polymer was employed to achieve controlled drug release and reduced mucociliary clearance. Microemulsion formulated using preliminary solubility study and pseudo ternary phase diagrams showed significantly improved solubilization capacity of Lorazepam with 54.31\u00b16.07nm droplets size. The effect of oil to surfactant/cosurfactant ratio and concentration of gelling agent on the drug release and viscosity of microemulsion gel (MEG) was evaluated using a 3(2) full factorial design. The gel of optimized formulation (MEG1) showed a drug release up to 6h of 97.32\u00b11.35% of total drug loaded. The change in shear-dependent viscosity for different formulations on interaction with Simulated Nasal Fluid depicts the crucial role of surfactant-polymer interactions on the gelation properties along with calcium ions binding on the polymer chains. It is proposed that the surfactant-polymer interactions in the form of a stoichiometric hydrogen bonding between oxyethylene and carboxylic groups of the polymers used, provides exceptional ME stability and adhesion properties. Compared with the marketed formulation, optimized MEG showed improved pharmacodynamic activity. Ex vivo diffusion studies revealed significantly higher release for MEG compared to microemulsion and drug solution. MEG showed higher flux and permeation across goat nasal mucosa. According to the study, it could be concluded that formulation would successfully provide the rapid onset of action, and decrease the mucociliary clearance due to formation of in situ gelling mucoadhesive system.",

Management of HD is focused upon control of symptoms, whether motor, cognitive, or psychiatric. There is no clear evidence to date of any disease-modifying agents. Referral of families and caregivers for psychological and social support, whether to HD-focused centers, or through virtual communities, is viewed as an important consequence of diagnosis.

Endogenous ALLO has been shown to be rapidly elevated in the brain by acute stress paradigms, such as immobilization, in animal models. The present study was designed to ascertain the role of neurosteroid biosynthesis in the anxiety-like behavior induced by immobilization stress. Mice were exposed to an immobilization stressor for 2 h. After 24 h, the mice that had been immobilized did not behave significantly differently in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test and in the elevated open platform (EOP) test than the mice that had not been immobilized. In contrast, finasteride-pretreated immobilization stressed mice did behave significantly differently in the EPM and EOP tests. These findings suggest that ALLO biosynthesis contributes to stress resistance. Furthermore, the ALLO mimetic drug alfaxalone appeared to antagonize the effects of finasteride by significantly changing the behavior in the EPM test or in the EOP test in finasteride (10 mg\u00a0kg(-1) )-pretreated immobilized mice. In addition, alfaxalone, unlike diazepam, did not affect the muscle tone of the mice, as measured by the grip strength test. These results suggest that alfaxalone is a promising anxiolytic candidate lacking benzodiazepine-like muscle-relaxant effects.",

However, its actions on astrocytic cells under metabolic injury are not well understood. In this study, we explored whether 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864), a TSPO ligand, might protect astrocyte mitochondria under glucose deprivation. Our results showed that 4'-chlorodiazepam preserved cell viability and reduced nuclear fragmentation in glucose-deprived cells. These effects were accompanied by a reduced production of free radicals and maintenance of mitochondrial functions in cells treated with 4'-chlorodiazepam. Finally, our findings suggest that TSPO might be involved in reducing oxidative stress by preserving mitochondrial functions in astrocytic cells exposed to glucose withdrawal.",

Participants (n=76) were randomized to 25\u2009mg oxazepam or placebo. Emotional mimicry was examined using video clips with emotional expressions. Empathy was investigated by pain stimulating the participant and a confederate. We recorded self-rated experience, activity in major zygomatic and superciliary corrugator muscles, skin conductance, and heart rate. In the mimicry experiment, oxazepam inhibited corrugator activity. In the empathy experiment, oxazepam caused increased self-rated unpleasantness and skin conductance. However, oxazepam specifically inhibited neither emotional mimicry nor empathy for pain. Responses in both experiments were associated with self-rated empathic, psychopathic and alexithymic traits.
