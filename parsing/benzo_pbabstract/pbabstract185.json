    "0": "Antipsychotic treatment discontinuation can be used to measure overall treatment effectiveness. Our goal was to investigate differential treatment discontinuation comparing olanzapine with other atypical antipsychotics. A post hoc pooled analysis of 4 randomized, double-blind, 24- to 28-week schizophrenia clinical trials included 822 olanzapine-treated and 805 risperidone-, quetiapine-, or ziprasidone-treated patients. A checklist was used to record the reason for discontinuation. Treatment differences were assessed between olanzapine and the other 3 antipsychotics combined. Poor response/symptom worsening was the primary reason for discontinuation, regardless of medication. The rate of discontinuation due to poor response/symptom worsening significantly varied by treatment (olanzapine, 14.23%, vs. other atypical antipsychotics, 24.60%; P < 0.0001). The rate of discontinuation due to intolerability of medication did not significantly vary by treatment (olanzapine, 5.60%, vs. other atypical antipsychotics, 7.45%; P = 0.13). Consequent to the differential rates of discontinuation due to poor response/symptom worsening, the olanzapine-treated patients experienced a significantly greater likelihood of overall treatment completion (53.9% vs. 39.3%; P < 0.001) and a significantly longer duration of treatment (19.1 vs. 16.1 weeks; P < 0.0001) than other atypical-treated patients. The predominant reason for the significantly lower discontinuation rate of treatment for patients taking olanzapine compared with that of patients taking other atypical antipsychotics was the significantly higher dropout rates in other atypical antipsychotics because of poor response/symptom worsening.", 
    "1": "Remission and relapse are clinical outcomes of increasing interest in schizophrenia. We analyzed remission and relapse, and the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with these outcomes, in the usual care of schizophrenia using the 3-year, follow-up data from a large cohort of outpatients with schizophrenia taking part in the prospective, observational, European Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes study. Of the 6516 patients analyzed for remission, 4206 (64.6%) achieved remission during the 3-year, follow-up period. Logistic regression analysis revealed that being female, having a good level of social functioning at study entry, and a shorter duration of illness were factors significantly associated with achieving remission. Treatment with olanzapine was also associated with a higher frequency of remission compared with other antipsychotic agents. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimated that relapse occurred in approximately 25% of the patients who achieved remission, with the risk of relapse remaining constant during the follow-up period. Shorter duration of illness, having hostile behaviors, and substance abuse were factors associated with a higher risk of relapse, whereas good level of social functioning and the use of olanzapine and clozapine were associated with a lower risk of relapse. In conclusion, the 3-year results of the Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes study indicate that the likelihood of remission decreases over the longitudinal course of schizophrenia, but risk of relapse is maintained even after 3 years of achieving remission severity levels. Results suggest that treatment with olanzapine is associated with a better chance of achieving remission than other antipsychotics. Moreover, the use of olanzapine and clozapine is associated with a lower risk of relapse compared with risperidone, quetiapine, and typical antipsychotics. The results should be interpreted conservatively because of the observational, nonrandomized study design.", 
    "2": "The purpose of this study was to measure forelimb force control and movement kinetics in rats, as they are affected by normal aging and the benzodiazepine lorazepam. Young (6 months), middle-aged (18 months), and aged (24 months) rats were trained to emit discrete forelimb responses on an isometric force disk within a 20-25 g force band for water reinforcement. Dependent variables included number of responses, percentage of reinforced responses, peak response forces, and inter-response times. Inter-response times were divided into two categories: inter-response times <0.5 s (reflecting rapid, discrete forelimb responses) and inter-response times 4-8 s (reflecting movement sequences). Aged rats exhibited no apparent deficits in forelimb force control. Although older rats emitted fewer responses than younger rats, their response accuracy was greater. Peak forces did not differ among the groups. Both categories of inter-response times were slower in the aged group, reflecting slowed discrete movements and movement sequencing. Lorazepam increased the number of responses and peak forces, decreased response accuracy, and lengthened inter-response times within the 4-8 s range (but not the <0.5 s range) in all age groups. The results suggest that movement sequences may be more sensitive to the effects of acute benzodiazepines than rapid discrete movements.", 
    "3": "Anxiety and depression are currently classified as separate clinical syndromes despite considerable similarities in their symptoms, pathophysiological substrates and response to treatment interventions. An alternative hypothesis views anxiety and depression along a temporal continuum, a construct that the current research attempts to model in a preclinical setting. In experiment 1, socially raised domestic fowl chicks separated from conspecifics demonstrated a pattern of distress vocalizations that sequentially models anxiety-like and depressive-like states. In addition, administration of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine provided pharmacological validation for the model in that they were capable of dissociating the anxiety-like and depressive-like states. In experiment 2, corticosterone levels were quantified across the isolation test session to provide convergent validity to the model. These findings fit well with the human clinical literature on the anxiety-depression continuum perspective, and suggest the consideration of a nosology that emphasizes the inter-relatedness of these clinical states rather than their boundaries.", 
    "4": "The anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines appear to involve opioid processes in the amygdala. In previous experiments, overexpression of enkephalin in the amygdala enhanced the anxiolytic actions of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam in the elevated plus maze. The effects of systemically administered diazepam are also blocked by injections of naltrexone into the central nucleus of the amygdala. The current studies investigated the role of delta opioid receptors in the anxiety-related effects of diazepam. Three days following bilateral stereotaxic injections of viral vectors containing cDNA encoding proenkephalin or beta-galactosidase (control vector), the delta opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (10 mg/kg, s.c.) attenuated the enhanced anxiolytic effects of 1-2 mg/kg diazepam in rats overexpressing preproenkephalin in the amygdala. Despite this effect, naltrindole failed to attenuate the anxiolytic action of higher diazepam doses (3 mg/kg) in animals with normal amygdalar enkephalin expression. Similarly, the mu opioid receptor antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (20 mg/kg, s.c.), had no effect on the anxiolytic effect of diazepam alone. These data support a role for delta opioid receptors in the opioid-enhanced anxiolytic effects of diazepam.", 
    "5": "Neuropsychiatric disturbances are found in 50-70% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. However, there are rare cases of catatonia being described in SLE. Some studies have shown the effectiveness of high-dose steroid, plasma exchange and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in lupus catatonia. Herein are described two SLE patients with catatonia who had good response to i.v. diazepam (i.e. relief of catatonia symptoms). Patient 1, with mild cortical atrophy, had great improvement in catatonia symptoms on i.v. diazepam 150 mg during a period of 5 days. Patient 2, without cortical atrophy, had quick response to i.v. diazepam 10-20 mg. Both patients had no recurrence during 6-month follow up. In conclusion, benzodiazepines may play an important role in the treatment of catatonia associated with SLE if patients refuse ECT treatment.", 
    "6": "Wilson's disease (WD), or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder of copper metabolism. It is an uncommon medical condition that produces psychiatric symptoms during the early phase in approximately 50% of patients. Reported herein is a case of WD in a young man presenting persistent delusional disorder of organic etiology, which resolved entirely after 4 months of combined pharmacotherapy. The present case demonstrates the importance of considering the occurrence of psychotic symptoms in WD patients given that psychiatric manifestations in WD are known to be uncommon as well as inhomogeneous. It also supports the hypothesis that psychopathologic features in WD have an organic foundation.", 
    "7": "A surgical procedure was evaluated to allow bile collection from the freely moving male Sprague-Dawley rats for the assessment of drug biliary excretion during regulatory safety studies. A catheter was implanted into the bile duct to divert the bile flow via an exteriorized loop. Following recovery from the surgery and verification of normal hepatic function, the exteriorized catheter was sectioned to allow collection of the bile and replacement with a commercial bile salt solution. Approximately 80% of the catheterized animals (10 females and 10 males) had normal serum liver enzyme levels 2 days after surgery. Then, the effect of acute or repeated administrations of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus on the biliary excretion of 14C diazepam was studied to validate the technique. A first group of 12 rats received an intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg 14C-diazepam and the total and sequential amounts of diazepam excreted in the bile were measured over 72 h. Biliary excretion accounted for 80% of diazepam elimination. These rats were then given an oral administration of 3 mg/kg tacrolimus on days 7 and 8 followed by the same intravenous dose of 14C-diazepam. Another group of 10 catheterized rats was given 21 daily oral doses of 3 mg/kg tacrolimus followed by a single intravenous administration of 14C-diazepam. No significant changes in diazepam biliary excretion were observed following either acute or repeated administration of tacrolimus. This study demonstrates the feasibility of drug biliary excretion investigations under Good Laboratory Practices conditions as a complement to regulatory acute or repeated dose safety studies.", 
    "8": "Different anilides derived from carboxylic acids and substituted anilines have been submitted to the photochemically induced Fries rearrangement giving the corresponding o-amino phenones under conditions that are compatible with the presence of acid-labile groups (such as N-Boc or TBDMSO) on R1 and R3. These compounds, not easily obtained in other ways, are useful building blocks for the preparation of benzocondensated heterocycles. After coupling with N-Boc amino acids and TFA-mediated deprotection, the products cyclized to the corresponding 3,5-disubstituted 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones, privileged structures predominantly active in the central nervous system. The same results were obtained by coupling with N-Cbz-protected alpha-amino acids followed by microwave assisted hydrogenolysis. When the Fries rearrangement was carried out on the anilide derived from N-Boc-Ala-OH and the further coupling done with N-Cbz-(OMe)Asp-OH, the formed benzodiazepines could be inserted in a peptide chain for the preparation of conformationally constrained peptidomimetics.", 
    "9": "The study was aimed at the evaluation of weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotics and its clinical risk factors in children and adolescents. Weight and body mass index (BMI) of initially hospitalised patients treated with clozapine (n = 15), olanzapine (n = 15), and risperidone (n = 15) were prospectively monitored on a weekly basis for the first 6 weeks. Different clinical risk factors were tested for their association with weight gain in the three groups. All three groups experienced significant weight gain between baseline and endpoint (p < 0.0001). For all weight measures, planned comparisons were all significant between olanzapine vs. clozapine and risperidone, respectively. Average weight gain was significantly higher for the olanzapine group (mean = 4.6 kg, SD = 1.9) than for the risperidone (mean = 2.8 kg, SD = 1.3) and clozapine (mean = 2.5 kg, SD = 2.9) groups. Olanzapine and risperidone, but not clozapine, caused a disproportionately higher weight gain in children and adolescents in comparison to adults.", 
    "10": "The process of aging influences both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. In addition to this, the issue of the increased incidence of chronic diseases as the age of people and the effects of medications in older adults becomes very complex. This article will review the influence of the aging process on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs. Specific concerns of older adults, including drug groups and side effects of concern, drug-induced geriatric syndromes, and medication adherence, are also discussed.", 
    "11": "The structural basis by which agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators exert their distinct actions on ligand-gated ion channels is poorly understood. We used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to probe the structure of the GABAA receptor in the presence of ligands that elicit different pharmacological effects. Residues in the alpha1 Met113-Leu132 region of the GABA binding site were individually mutated to cysteine and expressed with wild-type beta2 and gamma2 subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Using electrophysiology, we determined the rates of reaction of N-biotinaminoethyl methaneth-iosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin) with the introduced cysteines in the resting (unliganded) state and compared them with rates determined in the presence of GABA (agonist), 4-[6-imino-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyridazin-1-yl]butanoic acid hydrobromide (SR-95531; antagonist), pentobarbital (allosteric modulator), and flurazepam (allosteric modulator). alpha1N115C, alpha1L117C, alpha1T129C, and alpha1R131C are predicted to line the GABA binding pocket because MTSEA-biotin modification of these residues decreased the amount of current elicited by GABA, and the rates/extents of modification were decreased both by GABA and SR-95531. Reaction rates of some substituted cysteines were different depending on the ligand, indicating that barbiturate- and GABA-induced channel gating, antagonist binding, and benzodiazepine modulation induce specific structural rearrangements. Chemical reactivity of alpha1E122C was decreased by either GABA or pentobarbital but was unaltered by SR-95531 binding, whereas alpha1L127C reactivity was decreased by agonist and antagonist binding but not affected by pentobarbital. Furthermore, alpha1E122C, alpha1L127C, and alpha1R131C changed accessibility in response to flurazepam, providing structural evidence that residues in and near the GABA binding site move in response to benzodiazepine modulation.", 
    "12": "Despite the increasing research on placebos in recent times, little is known about the nocebo effect, a phenomenon that is opposite to the placebo effect and whereby expectations of symptom worsening play a crucial role. By studying experimental ischemic arm pain in healthy volunteers and by using a neuropharmacological approach, we found that verbally induced nocebo hyperalgesia was associated to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as assessed by means of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol plasma concentrations. Both nocebo hyperalgesia and HPA hyperactivity were antagonized by the benzodiazepine diazepam, suggesting that anxiety played a major role in these effects. The administration of the mixed cholecystokinin (CCK) type-A/B receptor antagonist proglumide blocked nocebo hyperalgesia completely but had no effect on HPA hyperactivity, which suggests a specific involvement of CCK in the hyperalgesic but not in the anxiety component of the nocebo effect. Importantly, both diazepam and proglumide did not show analgesic properties on basal pain, because they acted only on the nocebo-induced pain increase. These data indicate a close relationship between anxiety and nocebo hyperalgesia, in which the CCKergic systems play a key role in anxiety-induced hyperalgesia. These results, together with previous findings showing that placebo analgesia is mediated by endogenous opioids, suggest that the analgesic placebo/hyperalgesic nocebo phenomenon may involve the opposite activation of endogenous opioidergic and CCKergic systems.", 
    "13": "Toluene is a commonly abused inhalant. Its neurobiological effects are, at least in part, mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors. Since GABA(A) receptor function is critical during brain development, the long-term effects of toluene exposure during brain growth spurt were investigated. Spargue-Dawley male rats were administered with toluene (500 mg/kg, i.p.) on postnatal day (PN) 4-9. Behavioral and electrophysiological measures and the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits were examined on PN 28-32. The seizure sensitivity induced by bicuculline (a GABA(A) receptor antagonist), methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (inverse agonists of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor) but not 3-mercaptopropionic acid (a glutamate decarboxylase inhibitor) was enhanced by toluene exposure. Toluene exposure had no effect on the performance in the elevated plus-maze and rotarod test but reduced the responses to diazepam in these two tests. In vitro intracellular electrophysiological recordings employing brain slices from rats treated with toluene demonstrated a significant decrease in GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA1 neurons but an increased response to GABA perfusion. The relative abundance of the mRNAs encoding various subunits of GABA(A) receptor (alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, alpha5, alpha6, beta2, beta3, gamma2S, gamma2L) was examined in four brain regions (hippocampus, striatum, cortex, and cerebellum) by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. These results demonstrated that subunit- and brain area-selective alterations in GABA(A) receptors after toluene exposure during brain growth spurt. The alterations in GABA(A) receptors might be associated with the neurobehavioral disturbance in offspring of toluene-abusing women.",

Sixty-two dependent subjects admitted to a detoxification unit were included, all dependent on at least opioids and benzodiazepines. Other dependencies were not excluded.", 
    "16": "In the BPN/VPA group, 8 out of 12 patients (67%) completed treatment compared with 25 of 50 patients (50%) in the CLN/CBZ group; this difference between the groups was non-significant (p = 0.15). Withdrawal symptoms were reduced in both groups, but only the BPN/VPA group achieved a reduction in withdrawal symptoms from day one. The difference between the two groups was significantly in favour of the BPN/VPA group for days 2 (p < 0.001), 3 (p < 0.05), 4 (p < 0.001), 5 (p < 0.01), 7 (p < 0.01) and 8 (p < 0.05). The BPN/VPA combination did not affect blood pressure, pulse or liver function, and the total burden of side-effects was experienced as modest. There appeared to be no pharmacological interactions of clinical concern, based on measurement of Buprenorphine and Valproate serum levels. Both the patients and the staff were satisfied with the standardised treatment combination.", 
    "17": "Overall, the combination of Buprenorphine and Valproate seems to be a safe and promising method for treating multiple drug withdrawal symptoms. The results of this study suggest that the BPN/VPA combination is potentially a better detoxification treatment for polydrug withdrawal than the traditional treatment with Clonidine and Carbamazepine. However, a randomised, double-blind study with a larger sample size to confirm our results is recommended.",

    "19": "A total of 58 first-episode patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who had residual symptoms following treatment with risperidone were enrolled in an open-label, 12-week study of olanzapine. Dosing was determined by clinical judgment. The main efficacy measure was the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Patients with a 20% or greater decrease in BPRS total score plus a final Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale score of <or= 3 (mildly ill) were considered responders. The study was conducted from April 2001 to March 2005.",

In addition, BPRS subscales of anxiety/depression and excitement significantly decreased (19.1% and 29.5%, respectively; p < .001). The responder rate was 29.3% (17/58). BPRS positive symptom subscale score at baseline was significantly higher in nonresponders compared to responders (p < .001). Comparison of percentage change in BPRS total scores between responders and nonresponders revealed a significant difference at week 4 that continued until study endpoint (p < .001). Of 58 patients, 27 (46.6%) showed clinically significant weight gain (>or= 7%) from baseline.", 
    "21": "Although we cannot draw any conclusion from a study without a control group, favorable outcomes and good tolerance were observed after switching to olanzapine from risperidone in our population.

The medications used most commonly to treat RLS include dopaminergic drugs (levodopa, dopamine agonists), benzodiazepines, and narcotic analgesics. We report the cases of 2 patients with RLS who illustrate the problems of tolerance (declining response over time) and augmentation (a worsening of symptoms due to ongoing treatment) that can complicate the pharmacotherapy of RLS. We discuss the optimal management of RLS and propose strategies to overcome tolerance and augmentation such as a rotational approach among agents from different classes.", 
    "27": "Tagged biologically active molecules represent powerful pharmacological tools to study and characterize ligand-receptor interactions. However, the labeling of such molecules is not trivial, especially when poorly soluble tags have to be incorporated. The classical method of coupling usually necessitates a tedious final purification step to remove the excess of reagents and to isolate tagged molecules. To overcome this limitation, Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, referred to as \"click\" chemistry, was evaluated as a tool to facilitate the access to labeled molecules. In order to validate the approach, we focused our attention on the incorporation of a fluorophore (Lissamine Rhodamine B), a nonfluorescent dye (Patent Blue VF), or biotin into a muscarinic antagonist scaffold derived from pirenzepine. The reaction performed in acetonitrile/water, in the presence of CuSO4 and Cu wire, allowed us to obtain three novel pirenzepine derivatives with high purity and in good yield. No coupling reagents were needed, and the quasi-stoichiometric conditions of the reaction enabled the straightforward isolation of the final product by simple precipitation and its use in bioassays. The affinity of the compounds for the human M1 muscarinic receptor fused to EGFP was checked under classical radioligand and FRET binding conditions. The three pirenzepine constructs display a nanomolar affinity for the M1 receptor. In addition, both dye-labeled derivatives behave as potent acceptors of energy from excited EGFP with a very high quenching efficiency.", 
    "28": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the putative anxiolytic-like activity of an ethanolic extract prepared from the leaves of Apocynum venetum (AV) using the elevated plus maze (EPM) in mice. Male C75BL/6 mice were either treated orally with the AV extract or the positive controls diazepam and buspirone, respectively, 1h before behavioral evaluation in the EPM. A single treatment of AV extract markedly increased the percentage time spent on and the number of entries into the open arms of the EPM in doses of 30 and 125 mg/kg p.o., respectively. This effect was comparable to that of the benzodiazepine diazepam (1.5 mg/kg p.o.) and the 5-HT(1A) agonist buspirone (10 mg/kg p.o.). The effects of AV in 125 mg/kg were effectively antagonized by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (3 mg/kg i.p.). However, the effects of AV extract could only partially be blocked by the unspecific 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). Neither diazepam and buspirone nor the AV extract produced any overt behavioral change or motor dysfunction in the open field test. These results indicate that AV extract is an effective anxiolytic agent, and suggest that the anxiolytic-like activities of this plant are mainly mediated via the GABAergic system.", 
    "29": "This paper describes a case of co-morbid panic disorder and psychosis with a focus on the successful treatment of the panic disorder via a CBT approach. The patient has had only one episode of psychosis. The cognitive model of panic disorder is used as a template to consider this young man's psychotic experiences, in the context of some types of delusional beliefs, especially those involving the catastrophic and atypical misinterpretation of the physiological sensations associated with anxiety. This case emphasises the therapeutic value for certain patients of focussing therapy on the non-psychotic symptoms once the acute psychotic state has been managed.", 
    "30": "The potential for drug-drug interactions in psychiatric patients is very high as combination psychopharmacotherapy used to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders, to treat the adverse effects of a medication, to augment a medication effect or to treat concomitant medical illnesses, etc. Interactions can be pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic in nature. In clinical practice the benzodiazepines (BZD) are often prescribed together with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of depression. Although there has been no convincing evidence to show that such a combination is more effective than antidepressants alone and no clear indication for the use of this combination. Yet, anxiety frequently coexists with depression, and an anxiolytic is often added. But, it is BZD which are systematically prescribed together with antidepressants. However, BZD themselves have no antidepressive effects and we lack firm evidence for or against this combination therapy. We are focused on the pharmacodynamic interactions between anxiolytic such as BZD, and antidepressant drugs which may resulting in a reduction of the effects of one of the drugs. It is known that BZD decrease the serotoninergic transmission. Also, it may be suggested that combined BZD-specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors, should be avoided. This paper reviews, in vitro and in vivo and particularly in clinical, the evidences for drug interactions between BZD and antidepressant drugs. In clinical, all trials that compared antidepressant-benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressant alone for adult patients with major depression were sought by electronic searches of Medline and several other databases (1970 to 2005), combined with hand searching, reference searching and SciSearch.", 
    "31": "Clozapine, synthesized in the sixties, is an atypical antipsychotic drug whose history has been marked by its haematological toxicity. The purpose of this study was, ten years after it had been replaced at French psychiatrists' disposal, to gather data on the prescription modalities of clozapine, assess whether some factors could affect its efficacy, and describe the population of schizophrenic patients concerned.", 
    "32": "Psychiatrists in the Paris region were asked to answer a questionnaire about their patients treated with clozapine. The information collected was about socio-demographic data, history of psychiatric disorder and the way clozapine was used. It was a retrospective study concerning 98 patients.", 
    "33": "Subjects were 57 men and 41 women, with a mean age of 38 years. The majority of patients came from metropolitan France. Patients suffered from various clinical subtypes of schizophrenia, as assessed according to DSM IV criteria. Predominant symptomatology during lifetime was most often auditory hallucinations (41%). Mean duration of lifetime neuroleptic treatment was 10.3 years and breaks in follow-up were rare. Mean number of hospitalisations was 6.9 and a little less than half of the patients had been committed involuntarily. Lastly, 38% of patients had attempted suicide at least once and 35% had expressed hetero-agressive behavior. Main indication of clozapine was resistant schizophrenia (88.5% of patients) and mean duration of treatment was 2 years and 4 months. Treatment efficacy was assessed as good or medium in 77.9% of patients, at mean doses (322 mg per day) in keeping with data from the literature. Tolerance was considered on the whole as satisfactory by half of the clinicians. Among the 98 patients of the study, 21.6% had stopped taking clozapine. The reasons for withdrawal were: inefficacy (6.2%), granulopenia (5.2%), epilepsy (1%) and 8.2% for various reasons (half of these cases being non-compliance with treatment). The study of the 5 cases of granulopenia showed that 3 patients had another associated psychotropic medication: 1 patient received only clozapine as monotherapy, 1 data was missing. Two thirds of all patients were receiving another psychotropic drug in association with clozapine, mainly benzodiazepines (18.4%), antidepressants (15.3%) or mood stabilizers (7.1%). The \"therapeutic efficacy\" variable was compared with some variables in order to isolate factors possibly associated with a better efficacy of clozapine or, on the contrary, with a population of patients poorly responding to treatment. However, no statistically significant difference appeared according to the variables studied, such as gender or lifetime duration of neuroleptic treatment. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy according to schizophrenia subtype, main symptomatology during the course of illness or substance abuse. We studied whether any factor could affect the occurrence of granulopenia. No statistically significant difference was found. The mean age of patients having stopped the treatment because of granulopenia was higher than in the group with other reasons for interruption, but did not reach statistical significance. A trend also appeared towards female predominance (60% of women in the granulopenia group) and 3/4 of patients who had stopped their treatment because of agranulocytosis received another psychotropic drug in association with clozapine.", 
    "34": "As expected, the main indication for prescribing clozapine was resistant schizophrenia, but contrary to data from the international literature, the efficacy profile was the same whatever the clinical subtype of schizophrenia. The tolerance to clozapine was considered on the whole as satisfactory, but the high proportion of granulopenias leading to treatment withdrawal (5.2% of patients) confirms the need to remain cautious and stresses the importance of regular haematological monitoring. Furthermore, the study of the prescription modalities of clozapine shows that contrary to the guidelines, clozapine is often associated with other psychotropic drugs. In this study, it is striking to note that 75% of granulopenias occurred in a coprescription situation.", 
    "35": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and often disabling sensorimotor disorder. Epidemiologic studies suggest that RLS is an underrecognized and undertreated disorder affecting both children and adults. The diagnosis is based primarily on the following four essential criteria: (1) an urge to move, usually associated with paresthesias, (2) onset or exacerbation of symptoms at rest, (3) relief of symptoms with movement, and (4) symptoms manifesting in a circadian pattern. Supplemental workup including polysomnography, iron profile, and/or neuropathy screen can provide support for the diagnosis and aid in the treatment strategy. Behavioral techniques, dopaminergic agents, opiates, benzodiazepines, and antiepileptics all have potential value in treating this disorder. Dopaminergic agents continue to be the most effective RLS treatment. However, due to their potential long-term side effects, these agents should not be considered the sole treatment of choice. In the end, the therapeutic plan should be individualized to suit each patient's presentation and needs.",

We obtained both diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, whose findings suggested the presence of acute inflammatory and metabolic changes with peculiar distribution, which were not observed on conventional MR imaging. These techniques might help to demonstrate the extent and progression of the panencephalitis.", 
    "37": "Epidemiologic studies establish a relationship between nicotine use by adolescents and a subsequent involvement with drugs of abuse in adulthood. Recent research implicates the periadolescent period as a crucial time in development, during which nicotine use produces persistent adaptations that serve to predispose an individual to substance use. The present investigation evaluated the effects of periadolescent nicotine priming on young adult sensitization to reinforcement by a drug of abuse. Nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), mecamylamine (2 mg/kg, subcutaneous), mecamylamine and nicotine, or saline was administered as a once-daily injection to periadolescent (postnatal days 35-44) Sprague-Dawley male rats. The effects of periadolescent nicotine priming on reinforcement parameters in the young adult animal (postnatal day 80) were measured by conditioning a place preference with diazepam (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous). Rats were tested for place conditioning in a drug-free state. In contrast to other periadolescent treatment groups, rats treated with only nicotine during periadolescence showed a heterologous sensitization to the subthreshold dose of diazepam utilized during conditioning. Pretreatment with mecamylamine before periadolescent nicotine priming prevented the enhanced response to diazepam observed in the young adult animal. Priming with nicotine during late adolescence (postnatal days 60-69) failed to sensitize the adult rats to diazepam. This study supports a relationship between periadolescent nicotine priming and the production of persistent, behavioral adaptations in the young adult animal.", 
    "38": "Little is known about effects of commonly used anxiolytic drugs on psychologically evoked responses of two major stress systems, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis. The purpose of the present study was to assess effects of the anxiolytic alprazolam on responses of the HPA and the SAM axes to a standardized psychosocial stress protocol, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Forty-six healthy, non-smoking, non-medicated males, aged between 18 and 45 years, were invited once to the laboratory and received a single oral dose of 1mg alprazolam or placebo, respectively, 1h prior to the TSST. The secretion of ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine as well as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and psychological states (anxiety, wakefulness, good mood, calmness) in response to the TSST were measured. Subjects pre-treated with alprazolam showed a strongly blunted response of ACTH as well as total and free cortisol to the TSST. Whereas alprazolam-treated subjects displayed significantly lower systolic blood pressure immediately before the TSST, neither the secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine nor changes of heart rate in response to the stress test differed from placebo-treated subjects. Regarding psychological parameters, alprazolam clearly decreased subjective ratings on the questionnaire scale \"wakefulness\" and increased ratings on the scale \"good mood\", whereas ratings on scales assessing \"state anxiety\" or \"agitation\" were not affected. In healthy subjects, we observed a dissociation of the effects of alprazolam on the endocrine and the autonomic response to psychosocial stress. The psychological responses seemed to be masked by sedative properties of alprazolam.", 
    "39": "Psychotomimetic effects of NMDA antagonists in humans suggest that NMDA receptor hypofunction could contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A mouse line that expresses low levels of the NMDA R1 subunit (NR1) of the NMDA receptor was generated to model endogenous NMDA hypofunction. These mutant mice show increased locomotor activity, increased acoustic startle reactivity and deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. The present study examined effects of a typical antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, and two atypical antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine and risperidone) on behavioral alterations in the NR1 hypomorphic (NR1-/-) mice. Haloperidol significantly reduced activity in the wild type controls at each dose tested (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg). The NR1-/- mice were less sensitive to the haloperidol-induced locomotor inhibition in comparison to the NR1+/+ mice. In contrast to haloperidol, olanzapine reduced the hyperactivity in the NR1-/- mice at a dose that produced minimal effects on locomotor activity in the wild type mice. These data suggest that non-dopaminergic blocking properties of olanzapine contribute to the drug's ability to reduce hyperactivity in the NR1 deficient mice. In the PPI paradigm, haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) did not affect the increased startle reactivity in the NR1-/- mice, but did reduce startle amplitude in the NR1+/+ mice. Haloperidol increased PPI in both the mutant and wild type strains. Unlike haloperidol, risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) and olanzapine (3 mg/kg) reduced startle magnitude in both NR1+/+ and NR1-/- mice. Like haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine increased PPI in both NR1+/+ and NR1-/- mice. The similar effects of these atypical antipsychotic drugs in wild type mice and mice with markedly reduced NR1 expression suggest that the drugs were not working by a NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism to increase PPI. Since both haloperidol and the atypical drugs increased PPI, it is likely that D2 dopamine receptor blockade is responsible for the drug effects on sensorimotor gating.", 
    "40": "Using conflict drinking and forced swimming tests in rats, we examined the anxiolytic- and the antidepressant-like activity, respectively, of (2R)-1-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl]-2-[2-(4-methyl-1-piperidinyl)ethyl]-pyrrolidine (SB 269970), a selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist, after its intrahippocampal administration. SB 269970 at doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mug showed an anticonflict effect which was weaker than that of diazepam (40 mug), whereas SB 269970 at doses of 3 and 10 mug had marked anti-immobility action comparable to that of imipramine (0.1 mug). Importantly, the anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activity of SB 269970 seemed to be specific, since that agent - when given by the same route in doses effective in either model - affected neither the shock threshold, nor the non-punished water consumption, nor the exploratory activity of rats. The obtained results indicate that the hippocampus is one of the neuroanatomical structures involved in the potential anxiolytic and, in particular, antidepressant activity of SB 269970.",

Patients treated with VPA had significantly elevated 15-F2t -IsoP levels when compared with the control, carbamazepine, and clobazam groups (P < .05). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that younger patient age and exposure to second-hand smoke were significant predictors of elevated urine 15-F2t -IsoP levels within the control group (r2 = 0.261, P = .05 and P = .01, respectively). Subjects not exposed to second-hand smoke receiving valproic acid therapy had a significantly elevated mean urine 15-F2t -IsoP level compared to subjects not exposed to second-hand smoke in the carbamazepine, clobazam and control groups (P < .05).",

    "45": "This study was aimed at determining the effects of FrPbAII (174 Da), a novel isolated component from Parawixia bistriata spider venom, in the CNS of Wistar rats. Considering that FrPbAII inhibits the high affinity GABAergic uptake in a dose-dependent manner, its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects were analyzed in well-established animal models. Injection of FrPbAII in the rat hippocampus induced a marked anxiolytic effect, increasing the occupancy in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (EC(50)=0.09 microg/microl) and increasing the time spent in the lit area of the light-dark apparatus (EC(50)=0.03 microg/microl). Anxiolytic effects were also observed considering the number of entries in the open arms of the EPM and in the lit compartment of the light-dark box. Interestingly, when microinjected bilaterally in the SNPr of freely moving rats, FrPbAII (0.6 microg/microl) effectively prevented seizures induced by the unilateral GABAergic blockade of Area tempestas (bicuculline, 0.75 microg/microl). This anticonvulsant effect was similar to that evoked by muscimol (0.1 microg/microl) and baclofen (0.6 microg/microl), but differed from that of the specific GAT1 inhibitor, nipecotic acid (0.7 microg/microl). This difference could be accounted either for the parallel action of FrPbAII over glycinergic transporters or to an inspecific activity on GABAergic transporters. Data from the present investigation might be pointing to a novel compound with interesting and yet unexplored pharmacological potential.", 
    "46": "Randomised, double blind placebo controlled crossover study has been performed to evaluate the effect of single dose of anxiolytic alprazolam on the cognitive function in 18 healthy male volunteers. The subject received a single dose of 0.75 mg, 1.75 mg alprazolam or placebo in randomised order. Performances on cognitive tests (immediate and delayed word recall test, digit symbol substitution test, critical fusion frequency and multiple choice reaction test) and subjective rating of the drug effect have been evaluated before and at several occasions after the administration of alprazolam or placebo. According to the results of the statistical analysis alprazolam impaired the performance in cognitive tests dose dependently and induced subjective sedation. The applied test battery proved to be capable to measure the effect of the drugs on the cognitive function in pharmacodynamic studies.",

    "49": "Aqueous colloidal monoolein/poloxamer dispersions are under investigation as drug delivery systems. Depending on the composition and preparation procedure these dispersions may either contain predominantly vesicular particles or nanoparticles of cubic inner structure. To study the influence of ultrastructure on drug release, corresponding dispersions loaded with the model drugs diazepam (two different concentrations) and chloramphenicol were prepared by high-pressure homogenization with or without subsequent heat treatment. The dispersions were characterized with regard to particle size and their ultrastructure was confirmed with small angle X-ray diffractometry. Two techniques with high time resolution, differential pulse polarography (DPP) and ultrafiltration at low pressure were compared for their suitability to monitor rapid release from the dispersions. Instantaneous release was found for both drugs independent on the type of particle structure with the amount of released drug being controlled by the partition coefficient. Both release methods were suitable to monitor the rapid appearance of the releasable drug in the release medium.", 
    "50": "The purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the potential of low-dose intranasal midazolam compared to oral midazolam in claustrophobic patients undergoing routine body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Seventy-two adult claustrophobic patients referred for body MRI were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (TG1 and TG2). The 36 patients of TG1 received 7.5 mg midazolam orally 15 min before MRI, whereas the 36 patients of TG2 received one (or, if necessary, two) pumps of a midazolam nasal spray into each nostril immediately prior to MRI (in total, 1 or 2 mg). Patients' tolerance, anxiety and sedation were assessed using a questionnaire and a visual analogue scale immediately before and after MRI. Image quality was evaluated using a five-point-scale. In TG1, 18/36 MRI examinations (50%) had to be cancelled, the reduction of anxiety was insufficient in 12/18 remaining patients (67%). In TG2, 35/36 MRI examinations (97%) were completed successfully, without relevant adverse effects. MRI image quality was rated higher among patients of TG2 compared to TG1 (p<0.001). Low-dose intranasal midazolam is an effective and patient-friendly solution to overcome anxiety in claustrophobic patients in a broad spectrum of body MRI. Its anxiolytic effect is superior to that of the orally administrated form.", 
    "51": "General anesthetics, including etomidate, act by binding to and enhancing the function of GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), which mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Here, we used a radiolabeled, photoreactive etomidate analog ([(3)H]azietomidate), which retains anesthetic potency in vivo and enhances GABA(A)R function in vitro, to identify directly, for the first time, amino acids that contribute to a GABA(A)R anesthetic binding site. For GABA(A)Rs purified by affinity chromatography from detergent extracts of bovine cortex, [(3)H]azietomidate photoincorporation was increased by GABA and inhibited by etomidate in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 30 microm). Protein microsequencing of fragments isolated from proteolytic digests established photolabeling of two residues: one within the alphaM1 transmembrane helix at alpha1Met-236 (and/or the homologous methionines in alpha2,3,5), not previously implicated in etomidate function, and one within the betaM3 transmembrane helix at beta3Met-286 (and/or the homologous methionines in beta1,2), an etomidate sensitivity determinant. The pharmacological specificity of labeling indicates that these methionines contribute to a single binding pocket for etomidate located in the transmembrane domain at the interface between beta and alpha subunits, in what is predicted by structural models based on homology with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to be a water-filled pocket approximately 50 A below the GABA binding site. The localization of the etomidate binding site to an intersubunit, not an intrasubunit, binding pocket is a novel conclusion that suggests more generally that the localization of drug binding sites to subunit interfaces may be a feature not only for GABA and benzodiazepines but also for etomidate and other intravenous and volatile anesthetics.", 
    "52": "The most common clinical implication for the activation of the human pregnane X receptor (PXR) is the occurrence of drug-drug interactions mediated by up-regulated cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) isozymes. Typical rodent models do not predict drug-drug interactions mediated by human PXR because of species differences in response to PXR ligands. In the current study, a PXR-humanized mouse model was generated by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis in Pxr-null mice using a BAC clone containing the complete human PXR gene and 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. In this PXR-humanized mouse model, PXR is selectively expressed in the liver and intestine, the same tissue expression pattern as CYP3A. Treatment of PXR-humanized mice with the PXR ligands mimicked the human response, since both hepatic and intestinal CYP3As were strongly induced by rifampicin, a human-specific PXR ligand, but not by pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile, a rodent-specific PXR ligand. In rifampicin-pretreated PXR-humanized mice, an approximately 60% decrease was observed for both the maximal midazolam serum concentration (C(max)) and the area under the concentration-time curve, as a result of a 3-fold increase in midazolam 1'-hydroxylation. These results illustrate the potential utility of the PXR-humanized mice in the investigation of drug-drug interactions mediated by CYP3A and suggest that the PXR-humanized mouse model would be an appropriate in vivo tool for evaluation of the overall pharmacokinetic consequences of human PXR activation by drugs.", 
    "53": "Non-selective benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, interact with equivalent affinity and agonist efficacy at GABA(A) receptors containing either an alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 subunit. However, which of these particular subtypes are responsible for the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam remains uncertain. In the present study, we examined the ability of diazepam to reduce pentylenetetrazoLe (PTZ)-induced and maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures in mice containing point mutations in single (alpha1H101R, alpha2H101R or alpha5H105R) or multiple (alpha125H-->R) alpha subunits that render the resulting GABA(A) receptors diazepam-insensitive. Furthermore, the anticonvulsant properties of diazepam, the alpha1- and alpha3-selective compounds zolpidem and TP003, respectively, and the alpha2/alpha3 preferring compound TP13 were studied against PTZ-induced seizures. In the transgenic mice, no single subtype was responsible for the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam in either the PTZ or MES assay and neither the alpha3 nor alpha5 subtypes appeared to confer anticonvulsant activity. Moreover, whereas the alpha1 and alpha2 subtypes played a modest role with respect to the PTZ assay, they had a negligible role in the MES assay. With respect to subtype-selective compounds, zolpidem and TP003 had much reduced anticonvulsant efficacy relative to diazepam in both the PTZ and MES assays whereas TP13 had high anticonvulsant efficacy in the PTZ but not the MES assay. Taken together, these data not only indicate a role for alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors in mediating PTZ and MES anticonvulsant activity but also suggest that efficacy at more than one subtype is required and that these subtypes act synergistically.", 
    "54": "The clinicians usually do not consider syphilis in the differential diagnosis for patients with acute and chronic psychiatric symptoms. To familiarize clinicians particularly with neurosyphilis (NS) and to discuss the atypical antipsychotic alternatives, we wish to present a case with agitated, resistant psychotic symptoms related to neurosyphilis. The case was a 55-year-old male who has had anxiety, irritability, auditory hallucinations, ataxia, dysarthric speech, paranoid and persecutory delusions and agitated behaviour. Parenteral ziprasidone 20 mg/bid was initialized at the first day of admission to reduce agitation. Then it was switched to olanzapine velotab 10 mg/bid because of inefficacy. Parenteral cephtriaxon 1 g/daily was administered because of seropositive VDRl and TPHA and positive cerebrospinal fluid VDRl. Olanzapine velotab may be a good alternative antipsychotic and should be considered in reducing agitation and psychotic symptoms in NS.", 
    "55": "The study investigated whether four specified drugs would show similar patterns on tests considered to measure sedation. In addition, their drug-effect patterns on sedation and memory performance were compared to determine whether the sedative effects could be differentiated from the memory effects. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies, each with 16 healthy volunteers, were performed, one testing lorazepam (2.5 mg) and mirtazapine (15 mg) and the other olanzapine (10 mg) and haloperidol (2.5 mg). Subjective sedation was assessed by means of visual analogue scales (VAS) and objective sedation using a simple-reaction-time (SRT) task and a choice-reaction-time (CRT) task, code substitution (symbol digit substitution test (SDST)) and the peak velocity of saccadic eye movements (SEM). A verbal memory test (VMT) was administered to evaluate memory capacity. Apart from haloperidol, all drugs proved to impair performance on all five sedation indices. Contrary to the VAS, the objective measures yielded different response profiles. Two types of drug-effect patterns emerged: one for greater impairments in response speed (SRT, SEM) and one for greater impairments in information processing (CRT, SDST). Lorazepam and olanzapine impeded memory performance, whereas mirtazapine did not. With the use of standardized scores it proved possible to differentiate between the size of the effects of the drugs on the sedation and memory tests. To accurately assess the level and nature of sedation and to differentiate sedation from memory impairments different types of sedation measures are required. Besides studying the subjective effects, it is recommended to also test psychomotor responses and information processing speed.", 
    "56": "TPA023, a GABA(A) alpha2,3 alphasubtype-selective partial agonist, is expected to have comparable anxiolytic efficacy as benzodiazepines with reduced sedating effects. The compound lacks efficacy at the alpha1 subtype, which is believed to mediate these effects. This study investigated the effects of 0.5 and 1.5 mg TPA023 and compared them with placebo and lorazepam 2 mg (therapeutic anxiolytic dose). Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in this placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, four-way, cross-over study. Saccadic eye movements and visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to assess the sedative properties of TPA023. The effects on posturaL stability and cognition were assessed using body sway and a standardized battery of neurophysiological memory tests. Lorazepam caused a significant reduction in saccadic peak velocity, the VAS alertness score and impairment of memory and body sway. TPA023 had significant dose dependent effects on saccadic peak velocity (85 deg/sec maximum reduction at the higher dose) that approximated the effects of lorazepam. In contrast to lorazepam, TPA023 had no detectabLe effects on saccadic latency or inaccuracy. Also unlike lorazepam, TPA023 did not affect VAS alertness, memory or body sway. These results show that the effect profile of TPA023 differs markedly from that of lorazepam, at doses that were equipotent with regard to effects on saccadic peak veLocity. Contrary to lorazepam, TPA023 caused no detectable memory impairment or postural imbalance. These differences reflect the selectivity of TPA023 for different GABA(A) receptor subtypes.", 
    "57": "Guidelines on the prescription of benzodiazepines recommend their use be limited to the short-term relief of severe anxiety or insomnia. However, clinical experience suggests that in psychiatry these drugs may be being prescribed more widely. The aim of this survey was to investigate benzodiazepine prescribing in a specialist UK psychiatric hospital using a structured interview with consultant psychiatrists. Prescribers were also asked their views on the UK CSM guidance on benzodiazepines (1988). Of 412 inpatients, 77 (18.7%) were receiving 90 benzodiazepine prescriptions for psychiatric indications. Most prescriptions were for anxiety (45/90; 50.0%), aggression (23/90; 25.6%) and agitation (13/90; 14.4%). Use was commonest for acquired brain injury, schizophrenia and personality disorders. Much usage was chronic (only 4/90 (4.4%) prescriptions had been initiated within the previous 4 weeks) and off-label (85/90; 94.4%). Prescribers were concerned about the addictive nature of benzodiazepines for these patients and to a lesser extent about their abuse potential. Most consultants believed the UK CSM guidance was too restrictive in relation to their clinical practice and needed modification to encompass new indications, for example rapid tranquillization, and specialist prescribing. In psychiatry benzodiazepines are quite frequently used in the management of a number of groups of difficult-to-treat patients. Although largely not evidence based, some psychiatrists report a favourable risk-benefit ratio for benzodiazepines in the treatment of certain patients.", 
    "58": "Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed during treatment with olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine antipsychotic agent. Our objectives were 1) to characterize the effects of olanzapine on cardiac repolarization and 2) to evaluate effects of olanzapine on the major time-dependent outward potassium current involved in cardiac repolarization, namely I(Kr) (I(Kr): rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current).Isolated, buffer-perfused guinea pig hearts (n = 40) were stimulated at different pacing cycle lengths (150-250 msec) and exposed to olanzapine at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 microM. Olanzapine increased monophasic action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (MAPD90) in a concentration-dependent manner by 6.7 +/- 0.7 msec at 3 microM but by 26.0 +/- 4.3 msec at 100 microM (250 msec cycle length). Increase in MAPD(90) was also reverse frequency dependent; 30 microM olanzapine increased MAPD90 by 28.0 +/- 6.2 msec at a pacing cycle length of 250 msec but by only 18.9 +/- 2.2 msec at a pacing cycle length of 150 msec. Experiments in HERG-transfected (HERG: human ether-a-gogo-related gene) HEK293 cells (n = 36) demonstrated concentration-dependent block of the rapid component (I(Kr)) of the delayed rectifier potassium current: tail current was decreased 50% at olanzapine 3.8 microM. Olanzapine possesses direct cardiac electrophysiological effects similar to those of class III anti-arrhythmic drugs. These effects were observed at concentrations that can be measured in patients under conditions of impaired drug elimination such as renal or hepatic insufficiency, during co-administration of other CYP1A2 substrates/inhibitors or after drug overdose. These results offer a new potential explanation for QT prolonging effects observed during olanzapine treatment in patients.", 
    "59": "We investigated the relationships between L/S promoter (SERTPR) and l/s intron2 (SERTin2) genetic variants of serotonin transporter (SERT) polymorphisms with olanzapine-induced weight gain and treatment response in 94 female schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine for up to 3 months. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each patient prior to olanzapine administration and 3 months afterwards. To assess and evaluate improvement of clinical psychotic symptoms and therapeutic response to the antipsychotic, all patients were rated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome ScaLe (PANSS). Overall, the presence of S SERTPR allelic variant and SS genotype was associated with significantly higher weight gain in subjects who were non-obese at the time of admission. The presence of L SERTPR variant was associated with significantly better treatment response measured with total PANSS and general PANSS subscale, while the presence of l SERTin2 variant determined better treatment response only in several items. No evidence of linkage disequilibrium between the two loci was found in the sample. These findings identify genetic factors associated with oLanzapine-induced weight gain and treatment response in femaLe schizophrenic patients.",

We expose the case of a 39-year-old woman who ingested 12 g of hydroxychloroquine with bromazepam, paroxetine, and zolpidem, in a suicide attempt. Patient has developed central nervous system depression, hemodynamic failure, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and serious hypokalemia. Initially the patient has received conventional treatment with gastric lavage and activated charcoal for gastrointestinal decontamination, blood volume expansion and vasopressive drugs, intubation and mechanical ventilation, high dose of diazepam, and potassium replacement. A ventricular fibrillation was treated with external cardiac massage. In spite of this treatment, cardiogenic shock was uncontrolled, and imposed circulatory assistance. After extracorporeal circulation, we observed a spectacular improvement of hemodynamic parameters and electrocardiographic normalization at day one. Extracorporeal circulation could be used as a rescue treatment of cardiotrope and hydroxychloroquine overdoses.", 
    "61": "Three experiments examined the effects of drug-extinction when a drug state served as a conditional stimulus (CS) for sucrose delivery or as a positive feature for pairings between a discrete CS (e.g., 15-s light-on) and sucrose. Some conditioning models predict that drug state will facilitate the conditional response (CR) based on an association with sucrose whether the drug is trained as a CS or as a facilitator. If so, repeated presentation of the drug state alone (drug-extinction) should decrease the CR in both situations. Nicotine (0.4mg/kg), amphetamine (AMP, 1mg/kg), and chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5mg/kg) facilitated a goal tracking conditioned response to the discrete CS; however, AMP and CDP did not evoke reliable responding without an interposed stimulus, suggesting that associations between these drug states and sucrose are not expressed as anticipatory food seeking (goal tracking). Repeated presentation of each drug state alone did not disrupt facilitation by nicotine, amphetamine, or CDP; suggesting that the drug states did not facilitate goal tracking based on a direct association with sucrose. This latter finding implicates a higher-order or non-associative mechanism for facilitation of anticipatory food seeking by drug states in this Pavlovian discrimination task.", 
    "62": "Behavioral, electroencephalographic (EEG) and neuropathological effects of methomyl, a carbamate insecticide reversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity, were studied in naive or lithium chloride (24 h, 3 mEq/kg, s.c.) pretreated male Wistar rats. In naive animals, methomyl with equal potency produced motor limbic seizures and fatal status epilepticus. Thus, the CD50 values (50% convulsant dose) for these seizure endpoints were almost equal to the LD50 (50% lethal dose) of methomyl (13 mg/kg). Lithium pretreated rats were much more susceptible to convulsant, but not lethal effect of methomyl. CD50 values of methomyl for motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus were reduced by lithium pretreatment to 3.7 mg/kg (a 3.5-fold decrease) and 5.2 mg/kg (a 2.5-fold decrease), respectively. In contrast, lithium pretreatment resulted in only 1.3-fold decrease of LD50 value of methomyl (9.9 mg/kg). Moreover, lithium-methomyl treated animals developed a long-lasting status epilepticus, which was not associated with imminent lethality observed in methomyl-only treated rats. Scopolamine (10 mg/kg) or diazepam (10 mg/kg) protected all lithium-methomyl treated rats from convulsions and lethality. Cortical and hippocampal EEG recordings revealed typical epileptic discharges that were consistent with behavioral seizures observed in lithium-methomyl treated rats. In addition, convulsions induced by lithium-methomyl treatment were associated with widespread neurodegeneration of limbic structures. Our observations indicate that lithium pretreatment results in separation between convulsant and lethal effects of methomyl in rats. As such, seizures induced by lithium-methomyl administration may be an alternative to lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus, which is associated with high lethality.",

On evaluation, he was found to have hereditary chin trembling, a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by continuous or intermittent tremulous activity of the mentalis muscle. This is the first report of this kind from India. The tongue biting appeared to be the result of parasomnia. Treatment with clonazepam was very effective; it completely ameliorated the symptom of tongue biting but had no effect on chin trembling.", 
    "64": "The treatment goals for social anxiety disorder (SAD) are to reduce fear, avoidance, physical distress, disability, and comorbidity. This review illustrates some of the primary studies used to evaluate efficacy of treatments for SAD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and escitalopram and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine are effective treatments. They have the additional benefit of being able to treat comorbid conditions. For people who do not respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, treatment options include benzodiazepines (clonazepam, alprazolam, and bromazepam), alpha2delta calcium-channel blockers (gabapentin and pregabalin), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (moclobemide, although agents in this class are not available in the United States), antiepileptics (levetiracetam), and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine). The irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine can be considered an effective third-line therapy. Combination treatments may be beneficial, but more research is needed. Benefits of beta-blockers (propranolol and atenolol) are limited to performance anxiety. Botulinum toxin A may be an effective augmentation treatment option for severe axillary hyperhidrosis in patients with SAD. Studies show that patients with SAD who are maintained on paroxetine, sertraline, or clonazepam have a low relapse rate.", 
    "65": "Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) makes up around one-third of all cases of SE, affecting approximately 1,000 to 4,000 individuals per year in Belgium. Compared with convulsive SE, NCSE has received considerably less attention, is underdiagnosed and undertreated. However, if recognised, NCSE can however be treated successfully. A workshop was convened by neurologists from major Belgian centres to review the latest information on NCSE and to make recommendations on diagnosis and treatment. These recommendations are not only intended for neurologists, but also for primary care physicians and physicians in intensive care units. NCSE should be suspected whenever cases of fluctuating consciousness or abrupt cognitive or behavioural changes are noted. Confirmation of diagnosis by EEG should be obtained wherever possible. In view of the often subtle clinical signs, EEG is also vital for monitoring treatment outcome. Non-comatose patients should generally be treated in a neurology ward since referral to an ICU is unnecessary. First-line treatment should be an intravenous benzodiazepine. For many patients who fail to respond to benzodiazepines, intravenous valproate will successfully abrogate seizure activity. Intravenous phenytoin can be used in patients with focal NCSE in whom valproate is contraindicated or ineffective. Time and care should be spent in identifying an appropriate and effective antiepileptic drug regimen without recourse to anaesthesia. For comatose patients, treatment intensity should be graded according to epilepsy history, general medical state and prognosis. In some patients, intensive remedial measures may allow rapid resolution of NSCE, whereas in more vulnerable patients, such treatment may be counterproductive.", 
    "66": "A 79-year-old man with end-stage renal disease treated by automated peritoneal dialysis was referred to the emergency department for altered consciousness. The first investigations, including toxicology screening, failed to reveal the precise etiology. The patient was treated for a possible seizure. After the progression of central nervous system depression with bradypnea, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. It appeared later on that he had ingested by mistake one of his wife's medications, baclofen. Baclofen was detected in the blood sampled on admission at a level above the therapeutic range. Baclofen is mainly excreted by the kidney. A short-term administration of low-dose of baclofen is not effectively removed by peritoneal dialysis and may result in prolonged but reversible coma.", 
    "67": "The aim of the study was to compare oral midazolam and inhaled nitrous oxide as sedative agents during the management of children aged 5-10 years presenting for extraction of primary teeth under local anaesthetic. Subjects required two visits for the extraction of four primary teeth, one in each quadrant of the mouth, and were randomly allocated to be given nitrous oxide 30% in oxygen or oral midazolam 0.3 mg.kg(-1) at the first visit, the other technique being used at the second visit. Vital signs, sedation levels and behavioural scores were recorded, and postoperative recall and satisfaction were reported by the patients. Thirty-five children, with a mean [range] age of 7.4 [5-10] years, completed the treatment. The mean dose of oral midazolam given was 8.6 [3.3-16.5] mg. The mean times taken to achieve the maximum level of sedation for midazolam and nitrous oxide sedation were 15.9 [2-30] min and 6.8 [2-10] min, respectively. Physiological parameters remained within acceptable clinical limits for both types of sedation. Oral midazolam was considered acceptable by 59% and was preferred by 36%. Oral midazolam sedation in 5 to 10-year-old children was shown to be as safe and effective as nitrous oxide in oxygen sedation for extraction of primary teeth but would not be the method of choice for all patients.", 
    "68": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate 3 anesthetic protocols for intraduodenal drug administration by endoscopy in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Anesthesia was induced using intramuscular ketamine and midazolam, isoflurane (inhalant gas), or intravenous propofol in male and female rhesus monkeys. A noninvasive dosing line was placed in the duodenum by use of endoscopy, and 50% dextrose (3 ml/kg) was administered. Blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and reflexes (corneal, palpebral, pharyngeal) and myorelaxation (mandibular reflex and reaction to limb manipulation) were evaluated every 5 min. To estimate intestinal absorption, glycemia was evaluated prior to dextrose administration and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min after dosing. All 3 protocols resulted in successful induction of anesthesia. Recovery from isoflurane and propofol was significantly faster than from ketamine-midazolam. Duration of the recovery period after isoflurane was less variable than with propofol, but isoflurane produced greater hypothermia. Isoflurane and propofol resulted in predictable glucose absorption after intraduodenal dextrose administration, whereas ketamine-midazolam led to an inconsistent increase in glycemia.",

    "74": "We describe a modified hollow fibre assay (HFA) for investigating the potential of novel molecules as pharmaceutical agents. In particular the assay provides drug/target interaction data that can facilitate the selection of lead compounds for further evaluation in more sophisticated solid tumour models, whilst successfully implementing the 3Rs - the 'replacement' 'refinement' and 'reduction' of animals. This more ethical and rapid approach to early drug development does not compromise on the validity, sensitivity, predictivity or efficacy of preclinical evaluation. We present novel data using the standard cross-linker mitomycin C (MMC) as a positive control, and two investigational DNA interactive molecules (C1311/ SJG-136). Tumour cells were seeded in fibres and implanted into mice. Following treatment with an intraperitoneal injection, fibres were excised and cells retrieved for pharmacodynamic analysis using the comet assay/fluorescence microscopy. Microscopy results revealed nuclear uptake and localisation within cytoplasmic organelles of HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells following treatment with C1311 (150 mg/kg). Following treatment with SJG-136 (0.3 mg/kg) a 27.3% (p<0.001) DNA cross-linking (s.c.) effect was observed in the HL60 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cell line. DNA cross-linking effects of 55% (i.p) and 50% (s.c.) (p<0.005) were observed in the A549 lung carcinoma cell line following administration of MMC (6 mg/kg). These data are consistent with previous activity defined using solid tumour models, and support the use of the HFA for in vivo pharmacodynamic investigation whilst significantly reducing animal numbers and the influence of tumour growth on the welfare of mice.", 
    "75": "A chemically heterogeneous group of compounds acts at the benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site of the diverse gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor complexes which can assemble from more than 16 known subunits. Most 1,4-BZs like diazepam recognize all GABA(A)/BZ receptors containing the alpha1-3 or alpha5 together with any beta and the gamma2 subunit. Other compounds differentiate less, e.g. Ro15-4513, that additionally recognizes alpha4- and a6-containing receptors, or differentiate more, e.g. zolpidem, that recognizes preferentially alpha1-containing receptors. Here we describe the functional properties of 1-(4-chloro-phenyl)-4-piperidin-1-yl-1,5-dihydro-imidazol-2-on (ELB139) in the presence and absence of the BZ receptor antagonist flumazenil (Ro15-1788) on recombinant alphaibeta2gamma2 (i=1-5) receptor subtypes expressed in HEK 293 cells. The properties were measured with the whole-cell variation of the patch-clamp technique and compared to those of diazepam. Like the latter, ELB139 did not potentiate GABA-induced currents in alpha4-containing receptors, but it displays functional subtype specificity between alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5beta2gamma2 receptors with highest potency in alpha3-containing receptors but highest efficacy in alpha1- or alpha2-containing receptors, respectively. ELB139 acted as a partial agonist on these receptor subtypes reaching 40-50% of the efficacy of diazepam.",

    "80": "This study examines the effect of acute administration of caffeine sodium benzoate (CAF) on the anticonvulsant action of four conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs: clonazepam - CZP, ethosuximide - ETS, phenobarbital - PB and valproate - VPA) against pentetrazole (PTZ)-induced clonic seizures in mice. The results indicate that CAF at a dose of 92.4 mg/kg significantly reduced the threshold for PTZ-induced clonic seizures in mice from 69.5 to 51.7 mg/kg (p<0.05), being ineffective at lower doses of 69.3 and 46.2 mg/kg. Moreover, CAF at doses of and 92.4 mg/kg attenuated the protective action of ETS against PTZ-induced seizures, by increasing its median effective dose (ED50) from 127.7 to 182.3 (p<0.05), and 198.3 mg/kg (p<0.01), respectively. In this case, no pharmacokinetic changes in total brain ETS concentrations after systemic ip administration of CAF (at 92.4 mg/kg) were observed, indicating a pharmacodynamic nature of interaction between ETS and CAF in the PTZ-test in mice. In contrast, CAF (at a dose of 92.4 mg/kg reducing the threshold for PTZ-induced seizures) combined with other AEDs (CZP, PB and VPA) did not affect their anticonvulsant action in the PTZ test in mice. Moreover, CAF (92.4 mg/kg) did not alter significantly total brain concentrations of the remaining AEDs (CZP, PB and VPA). The evaluation of potential acute adverse effects produced by AEDs in combination with CAF revealed that neither CAF (up to 92.4 mg/kg) administered alone nor combined with the studied drugs (at doses corresponding to their ED(50) values in the PTZ-test) affected motor performance of animals in the chimney test. In conclusion, the acute exposure to CAF may diminish the antiseizure protection offered by ETS in epileptic patients. Therefore, patients treated with ETS should avoid CAF.", 
    "81": "The aim of the present experiment was to assess the involvement of adenosine receptor antagonists in benzodiazepine (BDZ) withdrawal signs, observed as the seizure susceptibility in mice. The discontinuation of chronic treatment with temazepam or diazepam decreased seizure threshold (one of BDZ withdrawal signs). The concomitant application of subconvulsive dose of pentetrazole (55.0 mg/kg) with low dose of flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) - a BDZ receptor antagonist, immediately induced BDZ withdrawal signs in these animals. The non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist (caffeine), and the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX), injected 15 min before the application of pentetrazole and flumazenil, were able to intensify BDZ withdrawal signs in mice. The most apparent effects were observed after administration of DPCPX, indicating that the adenosine A1 receptor may play a more important role in these effects. The obtained data demonstrate that the adenosinergic system is involved in BDZ withdrawal signs in mice, and adenosine A1 receptor plays an important role in this process.",

MDZ, 1-OHMDZ and diazepam as an internal standard were extracted from 1ml of alkalinized plasma using n-hexane-chloroform (70:30, v/v). The extract was injected into an analytical column (YMC-Pak Pro C(18), 50mmx2.0mmi.d.). The mobile phase for separation consisted of 10mM ammonium acetate and methanol (50:50, v/v) and was delivered at a flow-rate of 0.2ml/min. The drift voltage was 100V. The sampling aperture was heated at 120 degrees C and the shield temperature was 260 degrees C. The total time for chromatographic separation was less than 16min. The validated concentration ranges of this method were 0.25-50ng/ml for both MDZ and 1-OHMDZ. Mean recoveries were 93.6% for MDZ and 86.6% for 1-OHMDZ. Intra- and inter-day coefficient variations were less than 6.5 and 5.5% for MDZ, and 6.1 and 5.7% for 1-OHMDZ at 0.3, 4, 20 and 40ng/ml. The limits of quantification were 0.25ng/ml for both MDZ and 1-OHMDZ.

Patients with refractory solid tumours received oral BPU once weekly without interruption at doses ranging from 5 to 320mg using an accelerated titration design. Nineteen subjects received 54 cycles of BPU. Early pharmacokinetic findings of decreased clearance with increasing dose and plasma accumulation led to the expansion of the 320mg dose level. Two subjects then developed late haematologic dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that were associated with the highest plasma exposure to BPU and metabolites. Study enrollment resumed at dose 150mg with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring. Seven additional subjects (6 evaluable) were treated for a median of 2 cycles (range 1.5-4) without further myelotoxicity. A long half-life and accumulation of BPU and active metabolites were observed, recommending against a continuous administration. Weekly oral BPU therapy should be further tested using an interrupted schedule.",

We have shown recently that topiramate (TPM) dose-dependently protects hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons during initial status epilepticus in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy by inhibition of mitochondrial transition pore opening. In the present study, in order to evaluate possible positive effects of the treatment on learning and memory, we investigated water maze performance of rats receiving different dosages of TPM (20 and 100 mg/kg) after 40 min and 4 mg/kg diazepam after 160 min of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in relation to performance of animals receiving 4 mg/kg diazepam after 40 min of SE, and to performance of sham-treated control animals. Unexpectedly, 20 but not 100 mg/kg TPM significantly extenuated short-term memory deficits. While neuroprotective effects of TPM were observed in hippocampal CA subfields of animals treated with 100 mg/kg TPM, cell loss in rats treated with 20 mg/kg TPM was indistinguishable from animals receiving diazepam only. The present results indicate a negative dose-dependency of memory-saving effects of TPM applied during status epilepticus apparently dissociated from hippocampal neuroprotection.",

Without careful monitoring for the development of these conditions and control of the resulting adverse effects, patients receiving olanzapine may be at risk of developing fatal ketoacidosis. A review of post-mortem toxicological reports has revealed an increase in the incidence of post-mortem findings of acetone in decedents who were taking olanzapine over the past decade. A review of the current literature and a comprehensive review of case histories and toxicological findings were conducted at the Centre of Forensic Sciences (Toronto, Ontario). Olanzapine concentrations ranging from <62.5 to 858 ng/mL and acetone concentrations as high as 95 mg/dL were detected concurrently. Due to the unstable nature of olanzapine, in several instances quantitation was not possible despite elevated responses during qualitative screening procedures. Five cases suggesting olanzapine-induced ketoacidosis were identified based on the case history and toxicological findings. These data have been compiled and examined with respect to acetone concentrations following olanzapine use and the forensic relevance of post-mortem olanzapine and acetone concentrations are discussed.",

    "95": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in both vertebrates and invertebrates, acts on GABA receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in the CNS. GABA(A) receptors also represent a major site of action of clinically relevant drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol, and general anesthetics. It has been shown that the intracellular M3-M4 loop of GABA(A) receptors plays an important role in regulating GABA(A) receptor function. Therefore, studies of the function of receptor intracellular loop associated proteins become important for understanding mechanisms of regulating receptor activity. Recently, several labs have used the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify proteins interacting with GABA(A) receptors, for example, the interaction of GABA(A) receptor associated protein (GABARAP) and Golgi-specific DHHC zinc finger protein (GODZ) with gamma subunits, PRIP, phospholipase C-related, catalytically inactive proteins (PRIP-1) and (PRIP-2) with GABARAP and receptor gamma2 and beta subunits, Plic-1 with some alpha and beta subunits, radixin with the alpha5 subunit, HAP1 with the beta1 subunit, GABA(A) receptor interacting factor-1 (GRIF-1) with the beta2 subunit, and brefeldin A-inhibited GDP/GTP exchange factor 2 (BIG2) with the beta3 subunit. These proteins have been shown to play important roles in modulating the activities of GABA(A) receptors ranging from enhancing trafficking, to stabilizing surface and internalized receptors, to regulating modification of GABA(A) receptors.

    "96": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations usually affecting individuals with end-stage liver disease. The presence of HE is a poor prognostic sign, with 1-year mortality rates of almost 60%. There is much debate about the underlying mechanisms that result in this syndrome; however, elevated plasma and central nervous system ammonia levels are considered key factors in its pathogenesis. Initial evaluation of the patient presenting with overt HE should include a careful search for predisposing factors, including underlying infection, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, electrolyte disturbances, hepatocellular carcinoma, dehydration, hypotension, and excessive use of benzodiazepines, psychoactive drugs, or alcohol. The mainstay of treatment for many years has been nonabsorbable disaccharides, particularly lactulose. Alternative treatments, which usually are second line in patients who do not respond to lactulose, include zinc, antibiotics (neomycin, metronidazole, and rifaximin), ornithine aspartate, sodium benzoate, probiotics, and surgical intervention. Accepted treatments for HE are associated with significant unpleasant side effects, including diarrhea, renal failure, neuropathy, and other GI disturbance. Newer therapies are still in development, and most are awaiting human trials in order to confirm their benefit. These include manganese chelators, L-carnitine, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists, blood purification dialysis system, and an intravenous combination of sodium benzoate and phenylacetate.",

Astrocyte swelling triggered by ammonia in synergism with different precipitating factors, including hyponatremia, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, glutamate and ligands of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is an early pathogenetic event in HE. On the other hand, reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) including nitric oxide are considered to play a major role in HE. There is growing evidence that osmotic and oxidative stresses are closely interrelated. Astrocyte swelling produces RNOS and vice versa. Based on recent investigations, this review proposes a working model that integrates the pathogenetic action of osmotic and oxidative stresses in HE. Under participation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, Ca(2+), the PBR and organic osmolyte depletion, astrocyte swelling and RNOS production may constitute an autoamplificatory signaling loop that integrates at least some of the signals released by HE-precipitating factors.", 
    "98": "Benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists reduce food intake in males, but their actions in females, in whom stress-related eating disorders are more common, as well as their behavioral mode of action remain unclear. The consummatory effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands have alternately been hypothesized to reflect changes in the hedonic evaluation of food or secondary effects of anxiety-related or cognitive properties. To test the anorectic mode of action of benzodiazepine inverse agonists, the effects of FG 7142 on feeding microstructure were studied in nondeprived female Wistar rats (n=32). Microstructure analysis used a novel meal definition that recognizes prandial drinking. On pharmacologically synchronized diestrus I, rats were pretreated (-30 min dark onset) with the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (i.p. 0, 3.75, 7.5, 15 mg/kg) in a between-subjects design. FG 7142 delayed the onset of (16-541%), decreased the amount eaten (36-52%) and drunk (63-87%), and reduced the time spent drinking (59-87%) within the first nocturnal meal. Dose-dependent incremental anorexia continued 6 h into the dark cycle, whereas FG 7142 did not suppress the quantity, duration or rate of drinking past the first meal. Treated rats ate smaller meals (17-42%) of normal duration. This reflected that FG 7142 slowed feeding within meals (9-38%) by decreasing the regularity and maintenance of feeding from pellet-to-pellet. FG 7142 did not influence postprandial satiety; meal frequency and inter-meal intervals were unaffected. FG 7142 anorexia was blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil in a 2:1 molar ratio (n=17 rats). The very early, nonspecific (+10 min), but not subsequent (2.5, 4.5 h) feeding-specific phase, of FG 7142 anorexia was mirrored by anxiogenic-like behavior in FG 7142-treated (7.5 mg/kg) female rats (n=48) in the elevated plus-maze. Thus, benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists preferentially lessen the maintenance of feeding in female rats, effects opposite to those of palatable food.", 
    "99": "To investigate the usefulness of dexmedetomidine for restraint and sedation during hip radiographic examination of hip-extended or stress-radiography views when combined with either buprenorphine, butorphanol or diazepam.", 
    "100": "One hundred and twenty-seven client-owned clinically healthy golden retrievers or rottweilers were enrolled in a clinical trial that compared hip-extended and PennHIP methods for diagnosing hip dysplasia and were randomly allocated to receive dexmedetomidine or medetomidine in combination with buprenorphine, butorphanol or diazepam. Subjective assessments were made for response to pain, response to noise, palpebral reflex, muscle tone and overall quality of sedation; non-invasive physiological variables were also recorded.", 
    "101": "Overall quality of sedation was graded as good or excellent for dogs administered with a combination of butorphanol or diazepam. However, more dogs that received a combination involving buprenorphine had overall a relatively poorer quality of sedation and required additional administration of buprenorphine before the radiographic procedure could commence. Once sedated, clinically sufficient muscle relaxation accompanied by a very low proportion of dogs responding to pain or noise stimuli were observed in all treatment groups. Heart and respiratory rate, and procedure and recovery times were similar for all treatment groups, and no adverse events were observed during the study.", 
    "102": "Dexmedetomidine sedative protocols, particularly in combination with butorphanol and diazepam, can be used effectively and safely in dogs for radiographic procedures.", 
    "103": "Insufficient daytime sleep may result in reduction of effectiveness and safety during overnight military missions. The usefulness of temazepam and zaleplon to optimize afternoon sleep and their effects on performance and alertness during a subsequent night shift were studied.", 
    "104": "In a randomized double-blind within-subjects design, 11 subjects took 20 mg of temazepam, 10 mg of zaleplon, or placebo before a 5:30-10:00 p.m. sleep period. Sleep length and quality were measured. Subjects were kept awake throughout the night while alertness, cognitive performance, and muscle power were repeatedly measured.", 
    "105": "Temazepam provided significantly longer and qualitatively better sleep than zaleplon or placebo. During the night, sleepiness increased and muscle power was impaired in all conditions. Better sleep was correlated with less sleepiness during the night.", 
    "106": "Temazepam is useful to optimize a 4.5-hour afternoon sleep before overnight missions. Irrespective of hypnotic treatment, sleepiness and fatigue increased during the night shift.", 
    "107": "The authors performed a longitudinal study of the effects on thalamic volume of switching from typical to atypical antipsychotic medications.", 
    "108": "Magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 10 subjects with chronic schizophrenia taking typical antipsychotics and 20 healthy volunteers. Subjects with schizophrenia were switched to olanzapine; both groups were rescanned.", 
    "109": "At baseline, thalamic volumes in subjects with chronic schizophrenia were 5.8% greater than those of healthy volunteers. At follow-up, there was no significant difference between groups. Additional analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between baseline thalamic volume and dosage of typical antipsychotic medication. Higher dosages at baseline were correlated with larger reductions in volume after the switch to olanzapine.", 
    "110": "Antipsychotic medication effects may be a factor in the wide range of thalamic volume differences reported between subjects with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers.", 
    "111": "Hyperfunction of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine(2C) (5-HT(2C)) receptor is suggested to be involved in anxiety as evidenced by the fact that a putative 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-piperazine (m-CPP) causes anxiety in humans. We have recently identified FR260010 (N-[3-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenyl]-5,6-dihydrobenzo[h]quinazolin-4-amine dimethanesulfonate) as novel 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist from diaryl amine derivatives, and here characterized in vitro and in vivo profiles of the compound. FR260010 showed high affinity for human 5-HT(2C) receptor (K(i): 1.10 nM) and high selectivity over 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) (5-HT(2A)) receptor (K(i): 386 nM) and many other transmitter receptors. FR260010 showed antagonist activity at human 5-HT(2C) receptor in an intracellular calcium assay and showed no detectable intrinsic activity. The compound dose-dependently inhibited the hypolocomotion (ID(50): 1.89 mg/kg, p.o.) and hypophagia (ID(50): 2.84 mg/kg, p.o.) in rats induced by m-CPP, putative indices of brain 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist activity. We then compared the effects of FR260010 with those of two other anxiolytics belonging to different classes, diazepam and buspirone, in anxiety models in rats and mice and adverse effect tests in mice. FR260010 (0.1-3.2 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased behavioral indices of anxiety in all models, whereas buspirone (0.32-10 mg/kg, p.o.) did not significantly affect them in any models. In adverse effect tests, FR260010 and buspirone showed modest effects, whereas diazepam showed significant effects in all tests. These results suggest that FR260010 is a novel, potent, orally active and brain penetrable antagonist of 5-HT(2C) receptor, and may have therapeutic potential for treatment of anxiety, with more desirable profiles than benzodiazepines or 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor agonists.", 
    "112": "Behavioral disturbances associated with dementia are common and burdensome. Although no psychotropic medications are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat such behavioral symptoms, a variety of drug classes are commonly used for these purposes. Atypical antipsychotic medications may be somewhat effective and are generally considered the pharmacologic treatments of choice; however \"black box\" warnings have recently been added to their labels by the FDA, warning of significantly increased risks of short-term mortality. Older conventional antipsychotic medications may also be somewhat effective but appear to pose risks that can be at least as great as those of the newer atypical drugs. Although antidepressants, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists may be considered, particularly in patients with specific types of symptomatology, even less is known about their effectiveness and safety. Also, although various psychotropic medications used for behavioral disturbances in dementia patients may be somewhat effective, they have been increasingly associated with important safety risks.", 
    "113": "Cajal-Retzius cells are implicated in regulating neuronal migration and lamination during corticogenesis. In rodents, Cajal-Retzius cells are transient, being prevalent in the marginal zone of the embryonic neocortex and declining over the first two postnatal weeks. While studies have examined in postnatal neocortex the properties of GABA(A) receptors in Cajal-Retzius cells, less is known about their disposition at embryonic stages. Here, we combined patch-clamp electrophysiology and single-cell mRNA profiling to probe the expression of GABA(A) receptors in Cajal-Retzius cells. In embryonic neocortical slices, GABA elicited GABA(A) receptor-mediated current responses that were diazepam-insensitive and inhibited by Zn(2+), a pharmacological profile consistent with expression of gamma-less GABA(A) receptor isoforms. Non-Cajal-Retzius cells in the same embryonic slices, on the other hand, were robustly potentiated by diazepam and were insensitive to Zn(2+), typical of gamma-containing GABA(A) receptor isoforms, as were Cajal-Retzius cells in the postnatal neocortex. Single-cell mRNA profiling and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of GABA(A) receptor gamma subunit transcript and protein, respectively, in individual reelin-expressing cells in the postnatal cortex but not in their embryonic counterparts. We conclude that Cajal-Retzius cells express gamma-less GABA(A) receptors at embryonic stages and switch to expressing gamma-containing GABA(A) receptor isoforms during postnatal neocortical development.", 
    "114": "The increased serum prolactin is one of the side effects of antipsychotic treatment. The clinical signs of its elevated level are galactorrhea, gynecomastia, breast tenderness and sexual dysfunction. These symptoms can cause poor compliance and relapse of the psychiatric illnesses. The possible clinical interventions are: 1) reduce of the dose of the psychotropic drug and/or addition of a dopamine agonist; 2) switch to another drug. The aim of our study was to evaluate the results of the switch to quetiapine in the cases of elevated prolactin with galactorrhea.", 
    "115": "Five of our patients (from the January to July in 2005) treated for more than two months with new generation antipsychotics had the symptoms of galactorrhea/breast tenderness. The diagnoses in according to ICD-10 were: schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The differential-diagnostic examination were: physical, neuroimaging and laboratory including prolactin level followed up on the 4th, 8th weeks after the therapeutical intervention.", 
    "116": "The galactorrhoea disappeared and prolactin levels normalized after the switching to quetiapine. In the case of bromocriptine addition to previous therapy symptom stopped but the hormone level did not change significantly. There was remission and/or stabilisation of psychotic symptoms with quetiapine.", 
    "117": "The galactorrhea is one of the possible side effects of psychotropic drugs. We presented five patients with this kind of symptoms related to antipsychotic treatment. After the switch to quetiapine the galactorrhea and breast tenderness stopped, the level of prolactin normalized and the psychiatric condition of the patients showed remission. Our data support the benefit of the switch to another new generation drug, first of all to quetiapine, in the cases of galactorrhea and/or elevated prolactin level related to the antipsychotic pharmacotherapy.", 
    "118": "With a strong knowledge of the pharmacologic measures that work side-by-side with anesthesia, nurses can keep patients safe while preventing negative consequences.", 
    "119": "Alprazolam is successful in reducing anxiety but has a high addictive/misuse potential. Topiramate is a novel anticonvulsant which has been used as a mood stabilizer. Other anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine and valproate, have been used in alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Topiramate has recently been used in alcohol, cocaine and opiates withdrawal. There has been also one report of topiramate use in midazolam withdrawal. In our case of a patient with recurrent major depressive disorder, subthreshold anxiety disorder and addiction to alprazolam, topiramate appears to be efficient and safe in alprazolam withdrawal.", 
    "120": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive experimental technique which has mostly been investigated in the treatment of mood disorders with possible efficacy in depression. Among its potential side effects, there have been some reports of rTMS-induced (hypo)mania in the literature but none for rTMS-induced mixed episodes. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman suffering from refractory chronic major depression who developed a depressive mixed episode associated with a mild serotonin syndrome during her second week of rTMS treatment. She was receiving a combination of antidepressants, the doses of which were kept unchanged during rTMS treatment. Mixed as well as manic episodes may be induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation, complications already observed with antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised among clinicians using this experimental procedure, particularly in the treatment of bipolar depressed patients.", 
    "121": "Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and disabling disorders which are commonly treated with pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy. While benzodiazepines are of great value for the treatment of acute anxiety states, their long-term use is hampered by their well-known side effect profile. Meanwhile, antidepressants represent first line treatment options for anxiety disorders. However, their slow onset of action is a disadvantage for their use in these disorders. Therefore, there is need for novel anxiolytics with a rapid onset of action and a favourable side effect profile. Currently, there is a renaissance of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors as targets for the development of novel anxiolytic drugs. While compounds structurally related to GABA, e.g., pregabalin, have already entered large scale clinical development, GABA transporter inhibitors, subtype specific benzodiazepines and GABAA receptor modulating neuroactive steroids are promising new candidates. However, their clinical efficacy has still to be shown in clinical trials.", 
    "122": "Psychosis due to dopamimetic treatment is a difficult problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this structured review with meta-analysis was to evaluate which neuroleptic drugs can efficiently be used to treat drug-induced psychosis (DIP) in Parkinson's disease. Electronic databases were screened for the key words Parkinson's disease and psychosis. Only 7 trials with a satisfactory allocation concealment and data reporting were included into the study. Two trials compared low-dose clozapine versus placebo with a significantly better outcome for clozapine regarding efficacy and motor functioning. In one trial clozapine was compared against quetiapine showing equivalent efficacy and tolerability. However, in two placebo controlled trials quetiapine failed to show efficacy. In two further placebo controlled trials olanzapine did not improve psychotic symptoms and significantly caused more extrapyramidal side effects. Based on randomized trial-derived evidence which is currently available, only clozapine can be fully recommended for the treatment of DIP in PD. Olanzapine should not be used in this indication.", 
    "123": "Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to improve disruptive and repetitive behaviors in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), but they require assessment of potential side effects. This is the first placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine in the treatment of children and adolescents with PDD. Eleven patients with a diagnosis of either autism, Asperger's syndrome, or PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and aged 6-14 years were randomized into an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment study with olanzapine. There was a significant linear trend x group interaction on the Clinical Global Impressions- Improvement (CGI-I) and 50% on olanzapine versus 20% on placebo were responders. Olanzapine was associated with significant weight gain (7.5 +/- 4.8 lbs vs. 1.5 +/- 1.5 lbs on placebo). Olanzapine may be a promising treatment for improving global functioning of PDDs, but the risk of significant weight gain remains a concern. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the treatment of children with PDD.", 
    "124": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms are commonly related to interferon alpha treatment. The paper summarises the current knowledge about their aetiology, course, and treatment. Interferon alpha is a cytokine with antiviral and antineoplasmatic activity. It is commonly used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and B, malignant melanoma, Kaposi sarcoma, renal cancers, and some haematological malignancies. Treatment with interferon alpha is associated with depressive symptoms, cognitive disturbances, chronic fatigue syndrome, dysphoria, anxiety symptoms, anorexia, mania and psychotic states. Up to a half of the patients need psychiatric consultations, 10-25% of them need psychiatric treatment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are the results of direct affection of CNS by interferon and induced cytokines. They increase hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity, alter thyroid function and lead to a behavioural syndrome called 'sickness behaviour'. Moreover interferon induces the activity of 2, 3 indoloamine dioxygenase, the enzyme which converts tryptophan into kynurenine, leads to a reduced level of tryptophan, and thus to a reduced level of central serotonin and to an increased level of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites. Interferon also affects central opioid receptors and changes dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), other antidepressants i.e. nortriptyline, benzodiazepines, naltrexone, and neuroleptics (for maniac and psychotic states) are used to treat interferon associated psychiatric symptoms. Psychological therapy may also be useful, as well as psychoeducation and behavioural interventions.", 
    "125": "Three benzodiazepines are available for IV injection and are commonly used in anesthesia practice: diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam. The last is the most frequently used in anaesthesia practice. Benzodiazepines induce amnesia and sedation secondary to potentiation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA). Although sleep inducing doses of midazolam (0,2-0,4 mg/kg) may produce unconsciousness in one to three minutes it is commonly used for sedation and to ensure amnesia and premedication. The effects of midazolam on the cardiovascular system are minimal. Mild decreases in blood pressure and heart rate are indicative of its sedative effect. There have been reports of respiratory depression with diazepam, however this response is dose dependent and can be marked if concomitant doses of narcotics are used. Because of its potential for depressing respiration, especially if given with narcotics, the respiratory response of these patients needs to be monitored Intravenous midazolam should be titrated to effect and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil should be immediately available.", 
    "126": "Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered quinpirole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day (P)1 to P21. This drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the D2 receptor. Beginning on P62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. One day after olanzapine treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) for seven consecutive days. Dopamine D2 receptor priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a D2 receptor-mediated event, before olanzapine was administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. Results showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment induced D2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. On the MWM place version, D2-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the MWM. There were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. Brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal NGF, BDNF and ChAT that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. Neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in BDNF and ChAT in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment. These results show that olanzapine eliminates D2 receptor priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by D2 priming in the hippocampus.", 
    "127": "Inappropriate drug use is one of the risk factors for adverse drug reactions in the elderly. We hypothesised that, in elderly patients, geriatricians are more aware of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and may replace or stop PIMs more frequently compared with internists. We therefore evaluated and compared the prevalence of PIMs as well as anticholinergic drug use throughout hospital stay in elderly patients admitted to a medical or geriatric ward.", 
    "128": "In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 800 patients aged > or =65 years admitted to a general medical or geriatric ward of a 700-bed teaching hospital in Switzerland during 2004 were included. PIMs were identified using the Beers criteria published in 2003. The prevalence of anticholinergic drug use was assessed based on drug lists published in the literature.", 
    "129": "The prevalence of use of PIMs that should generally be avoided was similar in medical and geriatric inpatients both at admission (16.0% vs 20.8%, respectively; p = 0.08) and at discharge (13.3% vs 15.9%, respectively; p = 0.31). In contrast to medical patients, the reduction in the prevalence of use of PIMs between admission and discharge in geriatric patients reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). Overall, the three most prevalent inappropriate drugs/drug classes were amiodarone, long-acting benzodiazepines and anticholinergic antispasmodics. At admission, the prevalence of use of PIMs related to a specific diagnosis was not significantly different between patients hospitalised to a medical or a geriatric ward (14.0% vs 17.5%, respectively; p = 0.17), as compared with the significant difference evident at hospital discharge (11.7% vs 23.7%, respectively; p < 0.001). This was largely because of a higher prescription rate of platelet aggregation inhibitors in combination with low-molecular-weight heparins and benzodiazepines in patients with a history of falls and syncope. The proportions of patients taking anticholinergic drugs in medical and geriatric patients at admission (13.0% vs 17.5%, respectively; p = 0.08) and discharge (12.2% vs 16.5%, respectively; p = 0.10) were similar.", 
    "130": "Inappropriate drug use as defined by the Beers criteria was common in both medical and geriatric inpatients. Compared with internists, geriatricians appear to be more aware of PIMs that should generally be avoided, but less aware of PIMs related to a specific diagnosis, and of the need to avoid anticholinergic drug use. However, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution because some of the drugs identified as potentially inappropriate may in fact be beneficial when the patient's clinical condition is taken into consideration.", 
    "131": "This article compares the efficacy of olanzapine and risperidone for positive and negative symptoms using an 18-week, randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The hypotheses were that olanzapine would be more efficacious for treating negative symptoms, and that risperidone would be superior in treating positive symptoms. Positive and negative symptoms scores improved throughout treatment, regardless of medication type. Differences between the medications were found for negative and general psychopathology rating scales. Overall, olanzapine led to greater improvements in negative symptoms than did risperidone. When each scale was analyzed individually, greater improvements were found for olanzapine on Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) General,PANSS total, and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)attention. A nearly significant trend favoring olanzapine was found for the Calgary Depression Scale. Several negative symptom subscales followed a nonsignificant trend toward olanzapine being more efficacious than risperidone.Thus, there was a very consistent pattern of greater efficacy for olanzapine, particularly for negative symptoms. Despite the small number of subjects, this study shows the potential of a within-subject design to elucidate differences in efficacy.", 
    "132": "Our objective was to compare procedural distress during manipulation of forearm fractures in children receiving either axillary (brachial plexus) block regional anesthesia (20 children) or deep sedation with ketamine and midazolam (21 children). This was a prospective randomized unmasked controlled comparative trial conducted in an urban children's hospital emergency department. The 2 groups were similar in age (older than 8 years), fracture types, initial pain scores, narcotic analgesia received, and midazolam doses before fracture manipulation. The primary outcome measure was procedural distress during manipulation as measured with the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). The mean CHEOPS score was 6.4 +/- 2.8 in the group with axillary block and 7.5 +/- 1.6 in those receiving deep sedation; the difference between the CHEOPS scores in the 2 groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.126, 95% CI: 2.5, 0.3). Axillary block was used successfully in 18 (90%) of the 20 children. No patient in either group experienced any adverse events."
