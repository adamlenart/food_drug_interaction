    "0": "The opioid benzodiazepine, tifluadom, and the benzodiazepine tranquilizer, diazepam, were compared for their influence on morphine and scopolamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. Diazepam enhanced drug-induced hyperactivity, while tifluadom had no effect or reduced locomotor activity. The results demonstrate that tifluadom, a benzodiazepine compound possessing opiate-like analgesic properties, is devoid of either benzodiazepine or morphine-like effects in activity tests.", 
    "1": "A total of 66 outpatients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) criteria for generalized anxiety disorder began treatment in a randomized double-blind study that compared the efficacy and safety of buspirone and diazepam. Thirty-nine outpatients completed the 4-week trial. Both drugs were administered in a 1:1 dosage ratio; the daily prescribed dose did not exceed 40 mg. The mean daily dose of buspirone prescribed throughout the study was significantly higher than that of diazepam. Diazepam had a significantly earlier onset of efficacy than buspirone, although both drugs were equivalent after 4 weeks of treatment. Adverse reactions were more frequent in the diazepam group. Total scores from the Hamilton anxiety scale and physician's global ratings show that diazepam was significantly superior to buspirone during the initial 2 weeks of treatment. These findings are further corroborated by the results of patients' self-rated scales.", 
    "2": "Intracisternal administration of caerulein inhibited the food intake in mice, but the caerulein action was antagonized by benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and flurazepam which were administered intraperitoneally in low doses (0.2 to 2 mg/kg). The antagonism mechanism between caerulein and benzodiazepines remains unclear, but the characteristics of the antagonism were similar to those which had been observed with cholecystokinin and benzodiazepines.", 
    "3": "The EMIT-TOX Enzyme Immunoassay for benzodiazepines was evaluated. Reproducibility, linearity, accuracy, sensitivity, and interferences were tested and found to be in good agreement with the manufacturer's specifications. Furthermore, the reactivity of 15 benzodiazepines were studied. According their differential reactivity, the 15 benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups: good reactivity similar to diazepam (potassium clorazepate, prazepam, estazolam, medazepam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam); medium reactivity (clobazam, clonazepam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, triazolam); and low reactivity (oxazepam, ethyl loflazepate, lorazepam). A possible structure/reactivity relationship is discussed. It is concluded that this kit is well adapted for the rapid detection of most benzodiazepines, but in no way can the EMIT technique permit quantitative results without clinical information.", 
    "4": "A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of alprazolam in postmortem blood specimens is described. The method is sensitive, reproducible, and gives good resolution between other benzodiazepines. Recovery of alprazolam from spiked blood specimens at 100 ng/mL was 89%. The procedure was applied to a case of suicidal ingestion of alprazolam and a blood concentration of 177 ng/mL was determined.", 
    "5": "The pharmacodynamic interaction between midazolam and the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 has been investigated in six healthy male volunteers. Hypnotic steady-state concentrations of midazolam (55 +/- 11 ng/mL; mean +/- SD) have been achieved rapidly by an intravenous bolus of 0.07 mg/kg and maintained by an individual but constant infusion rate of 0.025 to 0.04 mg/kg/hr for eight hours. Following a two-hour control period, the antagonist (2.5 mg) or the solvent were injected double-blind in random order. Three hours later, the other medication was administered. Whereas plasma levels of midazolam remained constant throughout the complete eight-hour trial (Clearance = 670 +/- 96 mL/min) concentrations of Ro 15-1788 declined rapidly with an elimination half-life between 0.7 and 1.8 hours and a total plasma clearance of 702 +/- 235 mL/min. Concentrations of Ro 15-1788 approached the analytic limit of 2 ng/mL within three hours. The pharmacodynamic response to midazolam and the antagonist was assessed by a sedation index using visual analogue scales, reaction time (RT) measurements, and transformed Fourier analysis of the power spectrum of the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). About 30 to 45 seconds following the injection of Ro 15-1788, hypnotic action of midazolam was completely reversed as visualized by return to alpha rhythm in the EEG, shortening of prolonged RT, and normalization of the elevated sedation index. The antagonistic action lasted for about two to three hours. The abrupt arousal from sleep was not associated with any unpleasant sensations, however, three subjects experienced a profound perspiration for about ten minutes following the injection of Ro 15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "One hundred patients scheduled for surgery participated in a randomized double-blind trial designed to evaluate the effects of acute treatment with two doses of bopindolol (1 mg:BP1;2 mg:BP2) in comparison with those of 2.5 mg lorazepam (LR), 75 mg butalbital (BT) and placebo (PL). Anxiety was evaluated by the STAI X1 questionnaire on the day before surgery, in the late afternoon (time 0: basal) and in the evening (time 1). At the same times patients were requested to play a game of manual skill called \"Go Down\". The next day, in the morning (time 2), the patients were given the same questionnaire and were asked a series of questions about their sleep and awakening. Mean anxiety scores were significantly increased over basal values at both time 1 and time 2 in the PL and LR groups and at time 2 in the BT group, but neither in the BP1 nor in the BP2 group. The time needed to perform the \"Go Down\" test was significantly shorter than the basal value for both BP groups and significantly longer for the BT group, while nonsignificant modifications occurred in the PL and LR groups. Positive effects were obtained in patients treated with BP, at both doses, on ease of \"falling asleep\", number of \"night awakenings\" and \"reawakening mood\" while LR and BT were mostly ineffective, except for BT on ease of \"falling asleep\". It was concluded that a beta-blocker such as bopindolol may be more effective than a benzodiazepine or a barbiturate for the prevention of anxiety symptoms induced by a clearly defined stress situation, such as awaiting a surgical operation.", 
    "7": "In order to find out whether the administration of bromazepam and low doses of fluspirilene for six weeks had different effects, 45 out-patients of both sexes received 6 mg bromazepam per day or 1.5 mg fluspirilene per week in a double-blind randomized fashion. Overall therapeutic effectiveness was rated by the physician in two weeks' intervals. In addition use was made of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Adjective List (Janke and Debus), and the Symptom Check List (Derogatis). Both products reduced anxiety in a comparable manner. Under fluspirilene, however, global therapeutic improvement was often more obvious than under bromazepam. This therapeutic superiority was particularly remarkable in patients whose somatic concern in the meaning of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale was comparatively pronounced.", 
    "8": "Buspirone is a member of a new class of agents known as azaspirodecanediones, and represents the first nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic to be introduced in the U.S. in recent years. It does not resemble the benzodiazepines or older anxiolytics such as meprobamate and the barbiturates in pharmacologic profile. Buspirone lacks anticonvulsant activity, interacts minimally with central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, and does not cause muscle relaxation. The drug is reported to have minimal sedating effect, to cause no impairment of driving-related skills, and to have no euphoriant effect or addictive potential. With this low side-effect profile, buspirone should not require Drug Enforcement Agency scheduling controls. Clinical trials indicate buspirone is efficacious in the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety disorders. Answers to questions of possible side effects related to dopaminergic intractions must await post-marketing experience. Buspirone is a suitable addition to drug formularies as its pre-marketing data suggest several advantages compared with anxiolytics currently available.", 
    "9": "It has been shown that the 15-day stressing of rats by means of stochastic footshock combined with light flashes leads to a relatively stable \"behavioral depression\". Twenty-four hours after the last exposure to stress crude synaptosomes isolated from the whole brain demonstrated an increase in the KD of 3H-dihydroalprenolol specific binding and a lowering of the Bmax of 3H-WB-4101 specific binding sites. Specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam changes inconclusively: the decrease in the KD is followed by a reduction in the concentration of receptors. Specific binding of 3H-imipramine by brain membranes remains unchanged under the above conditions.", 
    "10": "The ability of several homologous benzodiazepine and heterologous nonbenzodiazepine ligands to alter the conductance increase induced in spinal cord neurons by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was determined. Complete dose-response curves were carried out on individual neurons, reducing error introduced by cell-to-cell variability. The efficacies of modulation differ for \"classical\" benzodiazepines and novel nonbenzodiazepine drugs in a manner consistent with a model of control of GABA receptor action through a common receptor. There was no apparent correlation between efficacy and potency. CL 218,872, a triazolopyridazine, gave the lowest efficacy of the tranquilizers tested. Ro 15-1788 (an imidazobenzodiazepine) potentiated g GABA with high potency and low efficacy, consistent with an action as a partial agonist and an \"antagonist\" of classical benzodiazepine action. In order of increasing efficacy, Ro 15-1788, CL 218,872, and flurazepam are partial agonists, whereas clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and flunitrazepam are full agonists. The beta-carboline drugs methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) are \"anxiogenics\" and convulsants that were found to exert through the benzodiazepine receptor-inhibitory and apparently insurmountable control of g GABA . beta-CCM and DMCM display large negative efficacies and act like effectors at a site distinct from the picrotoxin-sensitive chloride ionophore and coincident with the benzodiazepine site. The actions of these different benzodiazepine receptor ligands in vivo range from anxiolytic and anticonvulsant to anxiogenic and convulsant. Efficacy rather than potency almost certainly determines the qualitative nature of the pharmacological actions of these drugs.", 
    "11": "Radioligand binding studies were used to analyze the interactions of two novel anxiolytics, buspirone and TVX Q 7821, with a series of 10 neuronal membrane receptor sites. Buspirone (IC50 = 24 nM) and TVX Q 7821 (IC50 = 9.5 nM) display the highest affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) binding sites labeled by 3H-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-pro-pylamino) tetralin (DPAT). By contrast, buspirone is 16-fold weaker at dopamine (D2) receptors (IC50 = 380 nM), whereas TVX Q 7821 is 6-fold less potent at alpha-adrenergic1 sites (IC50 = 58 nM). At the other receptors studied, buspirone and TVX Q 7821 had similar pharmacological profiles. Both agents display moderate affinity for histamine (H1), alpha-adrenergic2, and 5-HT2 binding sites. The drugs are essentially inactive at 5-HT1B, calcium channel antagonist, muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. These results suggest that the anxiolytic effects of buspirone and TVX Q 7821 may be mediated by central 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "12": "Experience of treating 80 consecutive patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and a double-blind study of imipramine in acute painful neuropathy are reported. A standard stepwise protocol was used, based on imipramine as the drug of first choice, substitution of amitriptyline or mianserin as second choice, and, thirdly, addition of phenothiazine or clonazepam if necessary. Sixty per cent were satisfied with imipramine alone and all but 3 (5%) were improved by the stepwise scheme. Paradoxically, the most effective analgesia was obtained in those with the most severe and unpleasant pain. Often 150 mg of imipramine or amitriptyline was necessary. The onset of analgesia and relapse after withdrawal of treatment were rapid, facilitating clinical use, and suggesting a peripheral rather than central drug action.", 
    "13": "The effects of stimulatory and inhibitory compounds acting on both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors have been evaluated in the isolated urinary bladder from adult and immature (14-18 days old) rats. Acetylcholine and bethanechol were found to induce concentration-dependent contractions which were inhibited by atropine and pirenzepine; compound McN-A-343 had a negligible contractile activity whereas DMPP had no effect at all. Responses to electrical field stimulation were abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 X 10(-8) M), enhanced by eserine (10(-8) M) and scarcely affected by hexamethonium (10(-3) M), trimethaphan (10(-3) M) and d-tubocurarine (10(-3) M). Atropine, pirenzepine and DMPP induced only a partial inhibition (50%) of the twitch response, whereas compound McN-A-343 caused a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect which was maximum (100% inhibition) at 10(-2) M. No significant differences were found between results obtained in immature and adult animals as regards either the stimulatory or the inhibitory compounds tested. It was concluded that postjunctional muscarinic receptors were responsible for the stimulatory responses observed, whereas an additional involvement of unknown mechanisms, probably not related to the cholinergic system, was suggested by the peculiar results obtained with DMPP and compound McN-A-343 on electrically-stimulated urinary bladder. Whatever the mechanisms involved, however, they are already present at the first stage of postnatal development.", 
    "14": "In a prospective, controlled, randomized study of a prophylaxis for stress bleeding, 100 high-risk patients in an intensive care unit received, on a daily basis, 1 g of sucralfate every four hours, an antacid every two hours, or 2 g of cimetidine intravenously. All patients also received 50 mg of pirenzepine by intravenous infusion each day. Gastric pH was determined every eight hours. Bleeding was defined as macroscopically visible bleeding. The intragastric pH was less than 4 significantly more often in patients treated with sucralfate than in patients treated with the other agents, but stress bleeding occurred only in patients treated with cimetidine (n = 2) or antacids (n = 2). In the latter two treatment groups, the probability of bleeding correlated with the incidence of pH values below 4. No side effects of sucralfate therapy were observed. The results indicate that prophylactic treatment of stress bleeding with pirenzepine and sucralfate is at least as effective as combined treatment with pirenzepine and cimetidine or antacids.", 
    "15": "The healing rate of duodenal ulcers may be accelerated by secretory inhibitors such as histamine H2-receptor antagonists and pirenzepine, by antacids, by protective drugs such as sucralfate and colloidal bismuth, and by antidepressant drugs such as trimipramine. The effect of these drugs on the rate of healing is comparable; they differ with respect to practicability of treatment, incidence and types of side effects, and suitability for long-term administration. Currently, the most versatile and most thoroughly investigated drugs are the histamine H2-receptor antagonists.", 
    "16": "Three benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands of the beta-carboline group, namely the BZ receptor agonist ZK 93 423, the partial agonist ZK 91 296, and the antagonist ZK 93 426, were studied in epilepsy-prone Mongolian gerbils with different seizure types. Diazepam and clonazepam were included in these studies for comparison. In vivo binding studies in gerbils showed that all compounds were potent in displacing [3H]lormetazepam from binding sites in cerebellum and forebrain. Except for ZK 93 426, all drugs proved capable of dose dependently protecting gerbils from minor (myoclonic) and major (tonic-clonic) seizures induced by air blast stimulation. For ZK 93 423, ZK 91 296, diazepam and clonazepam, a highly significant correlation was found between anticonvulsant ED50S and ED50S for displacement of [3H]lormetazepam binding. Calculation of receptor occupancy revealed that beta-carbolines and benzodiazepines displayed anticonvulsant effects in gerbils at low occupancy (8-15% in forebrain). Even at almost total receptor occupancy, the BZ receptor antagonist ZK 93 426 was without any effect on seizure behaviour but antagonized the anticonvulsant effect of ZK 91 296. In contrast to diazepam, ZK 91 296 was devoid of any sedative side-effects even at 90% receptor occupancy. The data suggest that anticonvulsant beta-carbolines deserve interest as a new type of anticonvulsant drug.", 
    "17": "The interactions between pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin (PIC), or bicuculline (BIC) and diazepam, phenobarbital, or valproate were subjected to Schild plot analysis. Log dose-probit response curves for minimal clonic seizures were determined for three chemical convulsants in the absence and in the presence of various concentrations of three anticonvulsants. The calculated median convulsant doses were subjected to Schild plot analysis and the pA2 values determined. A comparison of the pA2 values for the various convulsant/anticonvulsant combinations suggested the following conclusions: (i) the sequence of events leading to minimal clonic seizures evoked by PTZ or PIC involves a common receptor, (ii) BIC acts through a different receptor, and (iii) Schild plot analysis of the antagonism between convulsant and anticonvulsant is in agreement with their antagonism in vitro studies. Thus, Schild plot analysis can be useful in the evaluation of anticonvulsant activity in vivo and may offer some insight into the potential clinical usefulness of anticonvulsant substances.", 
    "18": "Sprague Dawley albino rats were trained to discriminate an internal stimulus associated with CGS 9896, a non-sedating pyrazoloquinoline that exhibits anxiolytic activity in animals. Classical anxiolytics (diazepam and meprobamate) and proposed anxiolytic drugs having low sedative potential (CL 218,872 and tracazolate) generalized to the CGS 9896 discriminative cue. The CGS 9896 cue appeared to be mediated by a pure anxiolytic action as previous research has shown that this compound does not produce sedation or muscle relaxation. As such, the CGS 9896 stimulus would have both research and clinical application in the investigation of selective anxiomodulation. This is the first report of discriminative stimuli established on one of the newer atypical anxiolytics in which the discriminative cue appeared related to an anxiolytic effect.", 
    "19": "Analysis of the prevalence of the diagnosis benzodiazepine-dependence showed that there were only 150 cases (0.5%) out of almost 33 000 admissions during the period 1974 to 1983 and that a noticeable rise in frequency occurred after 1981. In a prospective quarterly incidence study for 1984, 18.5% of patients admitted fulfilled the criteria for long-term users (longer than 3 months continuous administration).", 
    "20": "In this article assays are described for caffeine, theophylline, procainamide, N-acetylprocainamide, quinidine, dihydroquinidine, paracetamol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, chloramphenicol, oxazepam, temazepam, diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, chlordiazepoxide, desmethylchlordiazepoxide and demoxepam using a uniform working procedure, five (slightly) different mobile phases and one HPLC system. Changing from one eluent to another is simple and a stable base-line is achieved within half an hour. Three of the five eluents are interchangeable and recycling of eluent causes no problems. Sample pretreatment is a single step extraction. Interferences can be overcome by changing the selectivity of the eluent by adjusting the tetrahydrofuran or triethylamine content. Furthermore it is shown how triethylamine can improve peak shapes of basic components and shorten their retention times.", 
    "21": "Intact primary cultures of astrocytes display benzodiazepine receptors, which can be labeled with [3H]Ro 5-4864. Binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 is specific, saturable and temperature dependent, being maximal at 0 degrees C. Scatchard analyses show a single population of high affinity binding sites with a Kd value of 6.7 nM and a Bmax value of congruent to 12,000 fmol/mg protein. The binding reaches equilibrium at congruent to 100 min, with k+1 of 0.0078 nM-1 X min-1 and is rapidly reversible with k-1 of 0.057 min-1. [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding is not modulated by GABA. Certain benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, diazepam, Ro 7-3351) and dipyridamole displace this binding with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, whereas other benzodiazepines (alprazolam, clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide) as well as carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital have IC50 values in the micromolar range. These characteristics resemble those of Ro 5-4864 binding to brain membrane preparations reported by other authors and thus indicate that the cultured astrocytes are good models of their in vivo counterparts.", 
    "22": "The cerebral cortices of rats habituated to the handling manipulation that precedes sacrifice by guillotine (unstressed rats) have a higher number of low affinity GABA receptors than naive rats (stressed rats). Foot shock stress delivered to handling-habituated rats 5 min before sacrifice decreased the number of low affinity GABA receptors to the level found in naive animals, while leaving almost unchanged the [3H]GABA binding in the latter group. Since benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition sites are the target through which benzodiazepines modulate the emotional states of the animals, we investigated whether these receptors were involved in the action of foot shock stress on GABA binding. The in vitro addition of diazepam (5 X 10(-6) M) to cortical membranes from foot-shocked handling-habituated rats brought back the number of low affinity GABA receptors to the level found in cortical membranes from handling habituated rats. Moreover, the effect of foot shock on low affinity GABA receptors was completely antagonized in vivo by pretreatment with the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 (30 mg/kg per os). Since the effect of foot shock on [3H]GABA binding is mimicked by the in vitro addition of beta-carbolines to cortical membranes from handling habituated rats, our working hypothesis is that an endogenous ligand for BZ recognition sites, possessing beta-carboline-like properties, is released during foot shock stress.", 
    "23": "Studies of hypnotics have generally focused on the effects the drugs have on sleep. It is now clear that they also have effects which can extend beyond the usual sleep period. These residual effects of hypnotics are assessed by studying the effects of these drugs on performance. This paper discusses the issues critical to evaluating studies of the effects of hypnotics on performance. Dose and half-life are important variables in determining the degree to which these daytime effects occur following nighttime use. However, a number of issues have yet to be clarified. Whether residual effects persist with chronic use is not clear. Whether any specific skill may be more or less sensitive to residual effects cannot be determined from the available information. Finally, the degree to which the decrements occur in different populations is not well understood.", 
    "24": "The adverse effects of minor tranquilizers, and more specifically benzodiazepines, on psychomotor and cognitive performance have been documented repeatedly over the years, and epidemiological studies have provided sufficient evidence of their role in traffic accidents. These studies indicate that drug plasma level (DPL) is insufficiently correlated with impairment and that other factors need to be considered in determining the impairment vulnerability. This report reviews several sources of individual variability, particularly as they relate to differential impairment effects. These sources, which include such factors as acute peak effects, acute tolerance, chronic tolerance, benzodiazepine receptor affinity and individual sensitivity, need to be examined before quantification of DPL is introduced as a criterion for driving under the influence. Behavioral testing itself may become the critical means of assessing drug- and/or drug with alcohol-induced driving impairment if acceptable standardized procedures can be developed. Attention is drawn to the rapid onset of impairment associated with acute effects of more lipid soluble drugs. The discussion of impairment of benzodiazepines should be seen in the perspective of their relative overall safety compared to other drugs used as minor tranquilizers.", 
    "25": "The influence of premedication on induction characteristics and respiration was studied in 40 children breathing spontaneously during enflurane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Two different premedications were used. Twenty children (Group DA) received a rectal solution containing diazepam 0.25 mg kg-1 and atropine 0.015 mg kg-1 and 20 (Group DMS) received a rectal solution of diazepam 0.5 mg kg-1, morphine 0.15 mg kg-1 and scopolamine 0.01 mg kg-1. The children in Group DMS had a significantly higher preoperative sedative score (P less than 0.01), faster induction of anaesthesia (P less than 0.01), lower occurrence of airway problems during induction and a smoother intubation (P less than 0.05) than the children in Group DA. However, the end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions were higher and the occurrence of apnoea was more common in Group DMS than in Group DA. Thus it was concluded that if the more sedative premedication (DMS) is to be used for enflurane anaesthesia in children, controlled ventilation would be preferable.", 
    "26": "Previous studies have shown that clozapine produces effects different from those of other antipsychotic drugs on positively reinforced responding but may give rise to similar disruptions of avoidance behavior. To investigate the actions of clozapine on avoidance responding in more detail the effects of this drug were compared with those of haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide in rats trained to avoid shock in a shuttle-box. Acute administration of all three drugs reduced avoidance responses and increased escape failures although clozapine produced this latter effect only at a high dose. With repeated administration of each drug over 4 days tolerance developed rapidly to the effect of clozapine, the effect of haloperidol increased and there was no systematic change in the action of chlordiazepoxide. Disrupted avoidance responding after acute administration of clozapine does not reflect the clinical antipsychotic action of this drug.", 
    "27": "To verify whether or not N4-oxide function is involved in the phototoxicity of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ, Librium), photopharmacology of reduced chlordiazepoxide (RCDZ) lacking the N4-oxide group was carried out and compared to that of CDZ. From the distribution of the 2 compounds in the skin and their UV-spectra in the wavelength region of the UV lamp, doses were calculated to allow the comparison of the photopharmacological effects. Contrary to what has been described for CDZ, no difference was found for RCDZ between irradiated and non-irradiated rats. The discussion leads to the conclusion that the N4-oxide group is responsible for systemic effects reported for phototoxic CDZ.", 
    "28": "The transport of a new sleep-inducer, 450191-S, and its metabolites, M-1, M-2, M-A, M-3 and M-4, to the brain was examined by the BUI (Brain Uptake Index) method in rats and by comparing the plasma and the brain concentration of the metabolites in mice. 450191-S was not passed to the brain and M-A was hardly passed, but the permeability of M-1, M-2 and M-3 was as high as that of diazepam. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of these benzodiazepines correlated with the lipid solubility expressed by the Rm value. After oral administration of 450191-S or M-1 to mice, the common major metabolites, M-1, M-2, M-A, M-3 and M-4, were detected in the plasma. At the dose level of 5.5 mumol/kg, M-A showed the highest plasma concentration among the metabolites, but only a low level in the brain. At an increased dose of 55 mumol/kg, M-2 showed the highest concentration in both the plasma and the brain. These results with mice correlated well with the results of BBB permeability in rats. The brain level of M-4 was almost at the background level in spite of a considerable plasma level. The total brain concentration of pharmacologically active metabolites immediately after administration of M-1 rose much faster and to a higher level than after 450191-S administration. These results may explain the pharmacological character of 450191-S.", 
    "29": "The effect of a new sleep inducer, 450191-S, on the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme system was examined using rats and compared with those of nitrazepam and phenobarbital. Cytochrome P-450-dependent 7-alkoxycoumarin O-dealkylation activity determined using liver homogenate and isolated microsomes increased after successive oral administrations of 450191-S, and induction of the enzyme system was observed by administration of 150 approximately 200 mg/kg of the drug for at least 3 approximately 5 days. Normal activity was recovered with withdrawal of the drug for 3 approximately 5 days after induction of the hepatic enzyme system. Administration of higher amounts of 450191-S (200 approximately 600 mg/kg/day) for 3 days caused remarkable increases in the O-dealkylase and UDPGA-glucuronyltransferase activities and cytochrome P-450 and b5 contents. Similar changes in the hepatic enzyme system were observed with administration of nitrazepam (200 approximately 600 mg/kg for 3 days, p.o.) or phenobarbital (10 approximately 40 mg/kg for 3 days, i.p.). We concluded that the inducing activity of 450191-S is almost the same as that of nitrazepam, but weaker than that of phenobarbital. When the hepatic enzyme system was induced by the administration of either 450191-S or phenobarbital, the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time was shortened with increasing doses of the drugs. On the other hand, sleeping time was prolonged by the administration of another type of inducer, beta-naphthoflavone. The results suggest that the inductive pattern of 450191-S is similar to that of phenobarbital.", 
    "30": "The present study examines the severity of naloxone-precipitated opiate withdrawal in morphine-pelleted rats and mice. Animals were chronically pretreated with either saline, diazepam, phenobarbital or amphetamine for 8 days prior to withdrawal precipitation. Indicators of withdrawal were changes in plasma corticosterone in rats and jumping behavior in mice. The use of chronic intravenous catheters in rats and one-way vision boxes allowed for serial blood sampling and sequential hormone determinations. Opiate dependence was established by the subcutaneous implantation of a 75-mg morphine pellet 72 h prior to withdrawal precipitation. All pretreated groups of rats with morphine pellets showed a substantial elevation of plasma corticosterone following the injection of naloxone (0.4 mg/kg, i.v.). Those with lactose pellets showed little change. The group pretreated with phenobarbital showed a lower, more attenuated withdrawal response as compared to saline or the other pretreated groups. The responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis to ether stress was evaluated. This was found to be unaffected by chronic phenobarbital suggesting that the drug may have a more specific effect on opiate dependence/withdrawal mechanisms. Similar studies in mice showed no differences in ED50 for naloxone-induced jumping behavior in any of the pretreatment groups.", 
    "31": "In rat the kinetics of flunitrazepam (FNZ) was evaluated by a radioreceptor assay (RRA) after i.v. administration of 1 mg/kg and after oral administration of 1 and 3 mg/kg. The i.v. kinetics is biexponential and the g.i. absorption is very rapid (with a plasma peak at 0.25 hour) with a good bioavailability (69%); the apparent distribution volume is high, 4.8 L/kg; the half-life is equal to 3.5 hours; the elimination constant is equal to 0.8 h-1; the urinary excretion of FNZ-equivalent is negligible; the plasma total clearance is equal to 3.9 (L/kg)h-1. The concentrations of FNZ-equivalents after oral administration of 1 mg/kg show a peak at the 2-nd hour with a very high concentration in the following organs (in decreasing order): brain, kidneys, heart, liver; after 8 hours no FNZ-equivalents are present in these organs except in the brain, which shows detectable concentrations at the 32-nd hour. The peak concentrations of FNZ-equivalent in brain, kidneys and heart are higher than the corresponding peak concentration in plasma.", 
    "32": "The results of five experiments showed that exposure to diazepam, hypoxia and monosodium glutamate during the prenatal or early postnatal period of rapid brain development may result in different behavioral consequences depending on the timing of the exposure rather than the nature of the agent. Moreover, male and female offspring may be affected differently by the same agent at different periods of development. Prenatal insults of various kinds impair the later performance of males but not the females in a complex learning task, while postnatal insults seem to affect detrimentally this same behavior in both males and females. The effects of perinatal insults on maze learning and open field activity do not lend themselves to explanation by \"feminization\" or \"masculinization\" of behavior caused by interference with prenatal gonadal hormones.", 
    "33": "Guide cannulae for unilateral push-pull perfusion were implanted stereotaxically to rest just dorsal to the hippocampus of the rat. On recovery, a tissue site in the hippocampus was double-labelled with a 1.0 microliter volume of [14C]-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and [3H]-norepinephrine (NE). Then the site was perfused by means of push-pull cannulae at a rate of 25 microliters/min with an osmotically-balanced CSF. When tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC) was added to the CSF perfusate in a concentration of 0.5-5.0 micrograms/125 microliters, the pattern of efflux of both of the monoamines exhibited an increase in release which was either immediate or delayed depending on the concentration and site of the hippocampal perfusion. Further, if the interval of a sequence of repeated perfusions was less than one day, the efflux of either [3H]-NE or [14C]-5-HT was attenuated. The addition of chlordiazepoxide to the CSF perfusate in a dose of 1.6 microgram/1.0 microliter did not affect the resting efflux of either of the monoamines, but did tend to reduce the THBC-induced release. A morphological \"mapping\" showed that the anatomical sites of perfusion in the hippocampus were homologous to those within which THBC injected locally induces anxiety-like behavior in the rat. Thus, it is envisaged that this beta-carboline serves to alter the behavior of the animal by a differential shift in the synaptic activity of monoamines within neurons of this limbic system structure which is implicated in emotional responses.", 
    "34": "The application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to tranquilized rats was assessed as an experimental technique to evaluate the response of the cardiovascular system to hypotension. After pilot studies had demonstrated that diazepam (600 micrograms X kg-1, i.v.) had no significant influence on the pressor response to unilateral carotid occlusion in unanesthetized and unrestrained rats, subsequent rats were tranquilized. When LBNP was applied, the decline in central venous pressure was linearly related to the level of negative pressure as was the initial fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Pulse-interval was highly correlated with the initial fall of MAP. The results indicate that the application of LBNP in the tranquilized rat can effectively produce systemic hypotension and elicit cardiovascular reflexes similar to those reported for other animals in response to LBNP, including humans.", 
    "35": "Drug-serum protein binding was evaluated in genetically obese Zucker rats, their lean littermates, and lean Sprague-Dawley rats. The free fraction (fp) of phenytoin was significantly higher in the obese rat (fp = 0.177) compared to its lean littermate (fp = 0.136), apparently due to displacement by free fatty acids. Conversely, diazepam and propranolol fp values were decreased in the obese Zucker rat (fp = 0.107 and fp = 0.122, respectively) compared to the lean Zucker rat (fp = 0.140 and fp = 0.174, respectively). Evidence strongly suggests that the increased binding of propranolol was not due to elevations in the serum concentrations of alpha1-acid glycoprotein (as is the case in the human obese population). Rather, the decreased fp for both diazepam and propranolol was a result of increased lipoprotein partitioning. Strain differences between the lean Zucker rat and lean Sprague-Dawley rat were also evident, with serum binding of the Sprague-Dawley rat more closely resembling the obese Zucker rat.", 
    "36": "Several investigations have demonstrated a reduction in benzodiazepine receptor binding after long-term exposure to this class of drugs. Such receptor alterations may contribute to the decreased efficacy of benzodiazepines in the management of convulsive disorders. To minimize receptor alterations, several patients with intractable seizures received alternate-day clonazepam therapy, resulting in improved seizure control. The favorable clinical responses suggest that alternative methods of benzodiazepine administration may circumvent receptor subsensitivity resulting from prolonged drug treatment.", 
    "37": "The effects of CNS-active drugs and neurotoxic agents on motor coordination in the rat were studied using a newly developed, automated technique. In this test, a tv/microprocessor-based system was utilized to detect and describe the movement and placement characteristics of one of the rat's hindpaws as the rat placed its paw from one rung to another while walking in a rotating wheel. In studies employing a wheel speed of 8.2 cm/sec and a single 90-sec trial, significant deficits in coordinated hindlimb movement could be detected following the acute ip administration of a variety of compounds, including acrylamide (0, 50, and 100 mg/kg), diazepam (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg), ethyl alcohol (0, 600, 900, and 1200 mg/kg), and tremorine (0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg). Further, results from a subacute study involving the oral administration of 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD; 0, 250, and 600 mg/kg) indicated that rats treated with 600 mg/kg, 2,5-HD were significantly impaired after 1 week of treatment and those treated with 250 mg/kg 2,5-HD, after 2 weeks of treatment. Although both groups improved during the recovery period, the performance of the 600 mg/kg group 5 weeks post-treatment was still inferior to controls. Taken together, these studies indicate that the coordinated hindlimb placement test provides a reliable, sensitive, and rapid technique for quantifying deficits in motor coordination in the rat during acute and prolonged exposure to neurotoxic substances.", 
    "38": "Eleven subjects received acetaminophen (650 mg i.v.) on two occasions in random sequence, with and without concurrent administration of probenecid (500 mg) every 6 hr. Nine subjects similarly received lorazepam (2 mg. i.v.) with and without concurrent probenecid. Acetaminophen half-life was prolonged during probenecid treatment (mean +/- S.E., 4.30 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.51 +/- 0.16 hr; P less than .001) due to markedly decreased clearance (178 +/- 13 vs. 329 +/- 24 ml/min; P less than .001) with no change in volume of distribution (65 +/- 4 vs. 69 +/- 3 l; NS). Urinary excretion of acetaminophen glucuronide during 24 hr was decreased (84 +/- 9 vs. 260 +/- 21 mg of acetaminophen as glucuronide; P less than .001) and acetaminophen sulfate excretion was increased (323 +/- 25 vs. 217 +/- 17 mg of acetaminophen as sulfate; P less than .005) during concurrent probenecid treatment. However, the sum of the two conjugated metabolites was not significantly different (407 +/- 28 vs. 476 +/- 20 mg of acetaminophen as glucuronide plus sulfate excreted per 24 hr; NS). Lorazepam half-life was also prolonged during probenecid treatment (33.0 +/- 3.9 vs. 14.3 +/- 1.08 hr; P less than .001) due to decreased clearance (44.7 +/- 5.4 vs. 80.3 +/- 13.2 ml/min; P less than .001) with no change in volume of distribution (111 +/- 5 vs. 111 +/- 7 l; NS). Formation of the ether glucuronides of acetaminophen and lorazepam is impaired markedly by therapeutic doses of probenecid. Sulfate conjugation is not affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "This study was designed to assess the value of measurement of plasma catecholamine concentrations as an objective index of anxiety. A preliminary study was undertaken on 11 healthy volunteers (medically qualified), to determine if venous cannulation per se produced any change in plasma catecholamine concentrations. There were no changes in plasma catecholamine concentrations in the 2 h following insertion of an i.v. cannula, suggesting that venous cannulation did not induce a measurable stress response. A second study was performed on 48 surgical patients who were asked to rate their perceived anxiety on a linear analogue scale immediately before premedication and immediately before induction of anaesthesia. Venous blood was obtained at the same time as these ratings. There were no significant changes in perceived anxiety or plasma noradrenaline concentrations following premedication. However, compared with values before premedication, there was a mean percentage increase in plasma adrenaline concentration of 40% before induction of anaesthesia. A significant correlation was shown between mean percentage change in Linear Analogue Anxiety Score and mean percentage change in plasma adrenaline concentrations (r = 0.32).", 
    "40": "The clinical efficacy of two sedative agents was compared in 21 young healthy patients undergoing surgery under extradural blockade. A state of sedation and amnesia in which patients lapsed into a sleep-like state when left undisturbed, yet spontaneously opened their eyes to make comments and co-operate with verbal commands, was sought. This was achieved readily by careful titration of responses and required a diazepam loading dose of 20 (+/- 15) mg given at a rate of 1 mg min-1 or 0.8% chlormethiazole edisylate infusion 10 ml min-1 given over 16 (+/- 6) min. Control of this state was easier with chlormethiazole (by varying the rate of infusion) than by giving repeated doses of diazepam. Both agents provided good anterograde amnesia; there was no retrograde amnesia. Considerable postoperative somnolence with a high incidence of relapse into amnesic and sedated states were noted with both agents. However, if the total volume of chlormethiazole infused was less than 300 ml, then a distinct advantage of abrupt and lucid recovery was apparent. Blood concentrations producing the desired clinical state were more variable for diazepam than for chlormethiazole.", 
    "41": "The binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) to specific sites in CNS membranes was investigated using cortical tissue from a variety of mammalian species. Mass law analysis of the site-specific binding of NBMPR data revealed that rat, mouse, guinea pig, and dog cortical membranes each contained an apparent single class of high-affinity (KD 0.11-4.9 nM) binding sites for NBMPR; rabbit cortical membranes, however, exhibited two distinct classes of NBMPR binding sites with KD values of 0.4 nM and 13.8 nM. Dipyridamole, a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport, produced a biphasic profile of inhibition of the binding of NBMPR to guinea pig, rabbit, and dog membranes (IC50 less than 20 nM and IC50 greater than 6 microM for NBMPR binding sites displaying high and low affinity for dipyridamole, respectively). These results are indicative of heterogeneity of NBMPR binding sites in mammalian cortical membranes. Rat and mouse cortical membranes appear to possess only one type of NBMPR binding site, which has low affinity for dipyridamole. Detailed analysis of inhibitor-induced dissociation of NBMPR from its sites in each species led to the conclusion that these multiple forms of NBMPR binding sites are different conformations of a single site associated with the CNS nucleoside transport system, rather than two distinct sites. It is also suggested that the affinity of dipyridamole for each conformation of NBMPR site indicates the susceptibility of that conformation of the nucleoside transport system to inhibition by dipyridamole.", 
    "42": "The immediate and residual response to single doses of oral diazepam 10 mg was measured in 11 young and 12 elderly healthy volunteers using postural sway, digit symbol substitution scores and subjective ratings. The effect on postural sway was markedly accentuated in the older volunteers, but the difference between groups in the effect on the other measures used did not achieve significance. The corresponding plasma total diazepam concentrations were lower in the older subjects beyond 0.5 h post dose and the concentrations of plasma desmethyldiazepam did not differ between the groups. Diazepam plasma protein binding was significantly reduced in the elderly subjects, but the plasma free (unbound) diazepam concentrations did not exceed those in the young group. There was poor correlation between the responses measured and the concentrations of either total diazepam, desmethyldiazepam or free diazepam. The results suggest the occurrence of a non-uniform effect of age on different aspects of benzodiazepine response, and that where an accentuated effect occurs the mechanisms are substantially pharmacodynamic.", 
    "43": "Pirenzepine is a 'selective' antimuscarinic agent which, unlike classic anticholinergic agents, inhibits gastric acid secretion at lower doses than are required to affect gastrointestinal motility, salivary, central nervous system, cardiovascular, ocular and urinary functions. On a weight basis, pirenzepine has one-tenth to one-eighth the potency of atropine in inhibiting stimulated gastric acid secretion in humans. Extensive controlled trials utilising endoscopy in outpatients with duodenal ulcers indicate that patient response to pirenzepine is dose related. Doses of 100 to 150 mg/day are superior to placebo in promoting duodenal ulcer healing and in diminishing day and night pain and supplementary antacid consumption. At such doses, the efficacy of pirenzepine appears to be superior to that of gefarnate 300 mg/day and generally not significantly different from that of cimetidine 1 g/day in treating duodenal ulcers. A beneficial effect of pirenzepine in the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence was apparent in preliminary studies in small numbers of patients, but its efficacy in this regard needs further confirmation and the optimum dosage determined. Less extensive data on the treatment of benign gastric ulcers suggest that pirenzepine 100 to 150 mg/day is superior to placebo and gefarnate 300 mg/day and does not differ significantly from cimetidine 1 g/day promoting gastric ulcer healing. Pirenzepine is well tolerated by most patients, with a low incidence of typical antimuscarinic effects on the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system or heart being reported in clinical studies. However, dry mouth and blurred vision are the more common side effects with clinically effective doses. Thus, pirenzepine appears to have relatively selective antimuscarinic activity, although controlled studies comparing pirenzepine and conventional antimuscarinics in patients with peptic ulcer disease have not been reported.", 
    "44": "We examined the effect of diazepam on the respiratory electromyographic (EMG) activity of the genioglossal muscle using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized protocol. Control measurements of minute ventilation, tidal volume, frequency, end-tidal CO2, and peak integrated inspiratory genioglossal EMG activity were made in 10 normal awake male subjects during quiet breathing and CO2 rebreathing. Subjects then received either 10 mg of diazepam orally or a placebo, and all respiratory measurements were repeated after 45 min. Each subject was studied on 2 separate days, receiving each treatment on a different day. The placebo had no effect on any of the measured variables. After diazepam, we observed an increase in end-tidal CO2 rebreathing, diazepam was associated with a reduction in minute ventilation, tidal volume, and frequency. When compared at equal end-tidal CO2 levels, genioglossal EMG activity and tidal volume were significantly reduced after diazepam. However, only older subjects demonstrated a reduction in EMG activity when compared at equal tidal volumes during CO2 rebreathing. We conclude that diazepam selectively decreases genioglossal EMG activity during CO2 rebreathing only in older subjects.", 
    "45": "The success of lithium in the treatment of manic-depressive illness has highlighted the problems posed by the minority of bipolar patients who are lithium nonresponders or who suffer severe adverse effects. A number of possible alternative treatments have been proposed, and the evidence in support of their clinical efficacy is evaluated. At this time, only the anticonvulsant carbamazepine can be regarded as a clinically applicable potential alternative to lithium. Further controlled studies are needed before the antimanic and prophylactic efficacy of carbamazepine can be regarded as conclusively established. Other treatment approaches are of considerable theoretical interest and of potential value clinically but need to be more thoroughly evaluated.", 
    "46": "Drugs can contribute to falls in the elderly. Older people have more diseases, take more medications, and more frequently have drug side effects. Current studies show that the link between drugs and falls is best illustrated by the barbiturates, and well founded with phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants. The more types of drugs a patient receives, the greater the likelihood of a fall. Combining drugs with various diseases adds to the risk. New research should concentrate on naming individual drugs in larger surveys of falling. Much more sophisticated statistical procedures and testing would allow analysis of the specific dangers of drug and drug/disease combinations.", 
    "47": "20 patients electively scheduled for operation were enrolled in the study and anaesthetized randomly with one of the two techniques etomidate + fentanyl (I) or flunitrazepam + fentanyl (II). Haemodynamics were assessed by continuously measuring blood pressure in the systemic and pulmonary circulations, as well as the heart rate, and intermittently determining the cardiac output. It could be shown that systemic arterial blood pressure, in spite of an initial drop after induction of anaesthesia, remained within an acceptable safety margin throughout the investigation period. Whereas heart rate remained almost constant in both groups, the rate-pressure product which may serve as a measure of myocardial oxygen consumption in the clinical setting, decreased considerably in both groups, although more appreciably under the influence of the anaesthetic technique flunitrazepam + fentanyl. Although the diastolic blood pressure as the most significant individual factor determining coronary blood flow was not changed appreciably in both groups, it remained at a higher level under the influence of the anaesthetic technique etomidate + fentanyl (I). We conclude that both anaesthetic regimes described here may be safely applied for the anaesthesia of patients with reduced coronary perfusion and cardio-haemodynamic reserve potential.", 
    "48": "Fifty-five outpatients with chronic duodenal erosions and no previous ulcer history were treated, in a double-blind fashion, with either pirenzepine (50 mg twice daily) or ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) for 6 weeks. The drugs were equally effective in inducing symptomatic relief. At endoscopic control, 70.4% of subjects in the pirenzepine group and 39.3% of ranitidine-treated patients showed complete healing (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that acid secretion is not an important factor in the pathogenesis of erosive duodenitis and that other mechanisms (such as impaired mucosal blood flow) must be considered.", 
    "49": "The effects of antisecretory agents, pirenzepine, atropine and cimetidine, on gastric mucosal lesions induced in rats by ethanol, HCI (0.6 N), HCI-acidified 50% ethanol and HCI-acidified 50 mM sodium taurocholate (TCA) were comparatively studied with PGE2. The involvement of gastric acid in the formation of ethanol-induced necrosis was also studied. PGE2 and pirenzepine inhibited necrosis induced by all necrotizing agents at the non-antisecretory doses, and the cytoprotective effect of pirenzepine was not abolished by indomethacin. Atropine and cimetidine did not inhibit HCI-induced necrosis even at the antisecretory dose. Atropine and cimetidine at the antisecretory dose inhibited necrosis induced by ethanol, but did not inhibit the red streaks. The ethanol-induced necrosis was also inhibited by neutralizing intragastric H+ with Tris buffer. In gastric fistula rats, alkalinization of the lumen was observed by exposure to ethanol, but necrosis was not produced. There is a close relationship between the necrosis and intragastric acid. Thus it is assumed that gastric acid is involved in the formation of ethanol-induced necrosis. It was suggested that pirenzepine possesses cytoprotective action which is not related to endogenous PGs. On the other hand, the antiulcer actions of atropine and cimetidine may be due, in a part, to antisecretory effects.", 
    "50": "Intracellular recordings were made from neurones of the rat locus coeruleus in vitro. Acetylcholine increased the firing rate by depolarizing the membrane; both muscarinic and nicotinic antagonists partially reduced this effect. In hexamethonium, pirenzepine shifted the acetylcholine dose-response curve to the right with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 200 nM, indicating an interaction with a m2-type of muscarinic receptor.", 
    "51": "The interaction of a mustard analogue of oxotremorine, N-[4-(2-chloroethylmethylamino)-2-butynyl]-2-pyrrolidone (BM 123), with muscarinic receptors in the rat cerebral cortex was investigated using 3H-ligand-binding methods. When cortical homogenates were preincubated with BM 123 (1.0 mM), washed extensively, and then assayed for the binding of the specific muscarinic antagonist, [3H](-)-N-methylscopolamine, a decrease in binding capacity was noted without an accompanying change in affinity. The rate at which BM 123 alkylated muscarinic receptors was sensitive to temperature, with little or no receptor alkylation occurring at 0 degree. Thus, it was possible to estimate the affinity of BM 123 and its transformation products for muscarinic receptors by measuring their ability to competitively inhibit 3H-ligand binding to cortical homogenates at 0 degree. When measured by competitive inhibition of [3H]oxotremorine-M and [3H](-)-N-methylscopolamine binding, the concentrations of the aziridinium ion of BM 123 required to displace 50% of specific 3H-ligand binding were 3.5 nM and 4.5 microM, respectively. In contrast, the parent 2-chloroethylamine and its alcoholic hydrolysis product were much less active. The kinetics of the alkylation of muscarinic receptors by BM 123 were consistent with a model in which the aziridinium ion rapidly forms reversible complexes with superhigh high and low affinity sites which slowly convert to covalent complexes. The rate of alkylation of the superhigh affinity site was slowest whereas the converse was true for the low affinity site. It was possible to alkylate the high and low affinity sites selectively with BM 123 by taking advantage of kinetic differences in the rates of alkylation of these two sites. Atropine, oxotremorine, and oxotremorine-M antagonized the rate of alkylation of muscarinic receptors in a manner that was consistent with competitive inhibition.", 
    "52": "In a prospective study of pH control for stress ulcer prophylaxis, intermittent iv infusion of the anticholinergic drug pirenzepine maintained the intragastric pH above 4 in only one of 17 ICU patients, while similar administration of the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine was successful in seven of 32 patients. This difference was not statistically significant. Of 15 patients in whom a maximum dose of 600 mg/day of ranitidine or 90 mg/day of pirenzepine failed to maintain pH, combination therapy was successful in 11, a significant (p less than .01) improvement. We conclude that neither ranitidine nor pirenzepine provides adequate control of pH for stress ulcer prophylaxis when used alone. If used together they are the most effective combination so far described for parenteral control of gastric pH in the critically ill. Regular monitoring of gastric pH is nevertheless essential to allow detection of therapeutic failures.", 
    "53": "The present study was performed on retinas of chick embryos receiving at day 8 of incubation an intracerebral injection of 0.02 microgram of corticosterone. We had previously shown with the use of [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate [( 3H]QNB) that such treatment induced the appearance of two muscarinic binding sites in the treated retinas, whereas only one was detectable in the controls. In the present study we investigated muscarinic cholinergic receptor subclasses with agonist and antagonist binding. Agonist binding was studied by varying the concentrations of carbachol and acetylcholine (10(-9) M-10(-5) M) in the presence of a constant concentration (0.2 nM) of [3H]QNB. Two subpopulations of receptors were revealed, a high- and a low-affinity receptor, in both treated and control retinas. However, in the hormone-treated retinas, the two subpopulations significantly differed from the controls in their affinity and in their relative percentage among the total receptor population. Moreover, using pirenzepine, an antagonist known to have the capacity to distinguish between muscarinic cholinergic subclasses, two receptor subpopulations were found to be present in the hormone-treated retinas but a single one in the controls. It is suggested that hormone treatment can either induce the appearance of a new subclass of muscarinic cholinergic receptors or favor the maturation of a population of retinal cells having these receptors. Pirenzepine binding in retinas from intact embryos of 7, 9, and 11 days of incubation revealed one receptor subpopulation. Thus, these findings are more consistent with the hypothesis that corticosterone effects the target cells, either inducing changes in muscarinic receptor and/or modifying the receptor environment.", 
    "54": "The authors have postulated previously that general anesthetic agents act via a potentiation of the inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at central synapses. If the hypothesis is true, GABA should induce anesthesia, however, GABA itself does not pass through the blood-brain barrier. A GABA analog was sought as a substitute to test the authors' hypothesis. A new bicyclic GABA analog, THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol) was selected because its properties are similar to GABA in vitro. THIP was found to induce anesthesia in rodents, and its behavior was compared with that of thiopental, ketamine, midazolam, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Complete loss of righting reflex occurred with doses of THIP and thiopental just under 100 mumol/kg, with ketamine and midazolam less than 50 mumol/kg and with gamma-hydroxybutyrate of more than 6,000 mumol/kg. Complete recovery from thiopental and ketamine occurred in less than 5 min, with midazolam recovery required about half an hour and with gamma-hydroxybutyrate and THIP it took about 1 1/2 h. THIP induced analgesia as well as sedation and loss of righting reflex. Recovery was complete, and no adverse effects were noted in these rodents.", 
    "55": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that acute hypovolemia would compromise the compensatory hemodynamic mechanisms to midazolam and decrease its metabolic clearance. Experiments were performed on seven chronically instrumented female beagle dogs. Animals received a single intravenous dose of midazolam, 10 mg/kg, 4 days apart during normovolemic (N) and hypovolemic (H) states in a random sequence. Hypovolemia was achieved by the withdrawal of 26 ml/kg of blood, equivalent to one-third of the calculated blood volume. Midazolam plasma concentrations were determined at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after midazolam injection. Elimination half-life (t 1/2 beta) was significantly longer and total clearance was significantly lower during H than during N. Initial distribution half-life, central compartment volume, total volume of distribution, and plasma protein binding were similar in both N and H states. Midazolam caused a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and an increase in heart rate (HR) during N, and produced significant decreases in SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during H. Midazolam led to similar per cent decreases in blood pressure and cardiac output in states N and H; however, the absolute values of blood pressure and cardiac output were significantly (P less than 0.001) lower in the hypovolemic state than in the normovolemic state. These data suggest that the hypotensive effects of midazolam, like those of other intravenous induction agents, could be potentiated by volume depletion.", 
    "56": "Using probit analysis, dose-response curves for induction of anesthesia with midazolam or ketamine were constructed in ASA class III and IV patients premedicated with morphine, 0.1 mg/kg, and glycopyrrolate, 4 micrograms/kg. For ketamine, ED50 values for abolition of the response to verbal commands, eyelash stimulation, and painful stimulation were 0.9, 1.3, and 1.3 mg/kg, respectively; corresponding ED95 values were 1.6, 2.3, and 4.3 mg/kg, which are within the range of clinically recommended doses. For midazolam, ED50 values for verbal commands, eyelash stimulation, and painful stimulation were 0.19, 0.24, and 0.36 mg/kg, significantly greater than those previously reported for unpremedicated ASA class I and II patients. The corresponding ED95 values, 0.35, 0.43, and 1.04 mg/kg exceed previously reported values and are appreciably greater than the doses used in most previous studies of midazolam induction. Midazolam decreased systolic blood pressure slightly but significantly (from 138 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 4 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.005), while diastolic blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged. In contrast, ketamine increased systolic blood pressure (from 141 +/- 4 to 164 +/- 5 mm Hg, P less than 0.005), diastolic blood pressure (from 71 +/- 3 to 88 +/- 4 mm Hg, P less than 0.005), and heart rate (from 84 +/- 2 to 102 +/- 4 beats/min, P less than 0.005). On the basis of these data, we conclude that in ASA class III and IV patients, midazolam induction allows for hemodynamic stability and avoids the significant tachycardia and hypertension associated with equipotent doses of ketamine.", 
    "57": "Clinical effects of intermittent intravenous administration of midazolam were compared with those of methohexital in two groups of ten premedicated patients each undergoing suction termination of pregnancy under general anesthesia. Both groups received intravenous fentanyl (1 microgram/kg) 5 min prior to administration of the induction agent. No significant difference was found between the two groups in induction time and quality of anesthesia. The recovery time was significantly (17 min) longer in patients who received midazolam (P less than 0.0001).", 
    "58": "This study compared the clinical effects of midazolam with methohexital when these agents were administered intravenously by intermittent injection in 20 outpatients undergoing suction termination of pregnancy. Both groups were premedicated with intramuscular papaveretum and scopolamine 1 hour before the procedure and received fentanyl 5 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. The mean induction time between completion of administration of the intravenous anesthetic agent and the loss of eyelash reflex was 36.7 + or - 15.2 seconds among the 10 women who received midazolam and 41 + or - 34.5 seconds among the 10 women in the methohexital group; this difference was not statistically significant. The group receiving midazolam was given an induction dose of 8.8 + or - 1.5 mg and a total dose of 17.8 + or - 3.8 mg. The methohexital group received an induction dose of 58.5 + or - 9.1 mg and a total dose of 127.5 + or - 22.8 mg. Recovery (defined as the interval between discontinuation of nitrous oxide and the time when the patient responded purposively to oral commands) took 20.1 + or - 8.4 minutes in the midazolam group and 3.2 + or - 2.4 minutes in the methohexital group, a difference that was highly significant. The mean scores for the overall quality of anesthesia were not significantly different. No serious cardiorespiratory complications were noted in either group. This study shows that midazolam compares favorably with methohexital in terms of induction characteristics and the overall quality of anesthesia; however, the recovery time is significantly longer (17 minutes) with midazolam.", 
    "59": "Specific high affinity binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to membranes from human brain was stimulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), pentobarbital, 1-ethyl-4-(isopropylidene-hydrazino)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4b]pyridine-5-carboxy lic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride (SQ 20009) and avermectin B1a and was unaffected by 2 microM 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro 5-4864) indicating that [3H]flunitrazepam in human brain as well as in rat brain predominantly binds to benzodiazepine receptors specific to brain, which was associated with a GABA receptor and several modulatory binding sites for drugs. The potency of several selective and non-selective ligands for benzodiazepine receptors for inhibition of the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was compared in membranes from human or rat brain cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It was demonstrated that all these compounds, derived from different chemical structures, had a remarkably similar potency for inhibition of the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the corresponding regions of the human or rat brain. However, irreversible labelling of benzodiazepine binding sites with [3H]flunitrazepam and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography revealed more photolabelled protein bands in human than in rat cerebellum and hippocampus. The results seem to indicate that, although the pharmacological properties of reversible binding of [3H]flunitrazepam are remarkably similar in membranes from rat or human brain, the molecular heterogeneity of benzodiazepine binding sites is even greater in human than in rat brain.", 
    "60": "The effects of diazepam and the pyrazoloquinoline benzodiazepine receptor ligands CGS8216, CGS9896, and CGS9895 on schedule-controlled responding were studied in dogs. Responding was maintained under a multiple fixed-interval (FI) 5-min fixed-ratio (FR) 30 response schedule of food presentation. Diazepam (PO) produced dose-related decreases in response rates under FR component. Under the FI, rates first increased and then decreased with increasing doses of diazepam. Diazepam also produced a dose-related disruption of the temporal pattern of responding under the FI as measured by decreases in quarter-life values. CGS8216 IV produced dose-related decreases in response rates under both components. The highest oral dose of CGS8216 also decreased rates in both components. CGS8216 was approximately 100 times more potent by the IV route as compared to the oral route. CGS9896 IV had no significant effect on responding under either component of the multiple schedule. However, with increasing doses of CGS9896 PO, response rates under both components first decreased and then returned to control values. CGS9895 PO was without significant effect on responding. When CGS8216 was administered concomitantly with graded doses of diazepam, the former drug blocked the rate-decreasing effects of diazepam under the FR component, but not the rate-increasing effects of diazepam under the FI. The present results demonstrate that although these three pyrazoloquinolines are benzodiazepine receptor ligands, they do not exhibit diazepam-like effects on schedule-controlled behavior.", 
    "61": "The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the possible role of GABAergic mechanism in the convulsant action of RO5-4864. Benzodiazepines (BZ) and other agents which facilitate central GABAergic transmission delayed the onset of facial and forelimb clonus, whereas tonic hind limb extension was blocked in a dose-dependent manner. RO5-4864-induced convulsions were blocked by diazepam, clonazepam, pentobarbital, ethanol and amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA). RO5-4864-induced convulsions were not blocked by the BZ antagonist RO15-1788. Specifically, RO15-1788 caused a decrease in the onset of severity component of tonic seizures, which tended to become generalized and precipitated in a tonic extension of the hindlimbs. Further, subconvulsive doses of a direct GABA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, enhanced the proconvulsant action of RO5-4864, indicating thereby a potential antagonism of the central GABAergic transmission. These observations strongly suggest that RO5-4864 probably elicits convulsions by selective impairment of the GABAergic transmission.", 
    "62": "The intracortical injection of 500 units of penicillin in rabbits elicited intermittent bilateral spikes or spike-wave complexes followed by generalization of the epileptiform activity characterized by repeated ictal high-voltage, high frequency spikes paralleled by generalized convulsions. Administration of phencyclidine (PCP) (0.7-1.0 mg/Kg i.v.), ketamine (KT) (20-40 mg/Kg i.v.), pentobarbital (PB) (10 mg/Kg i.v.) and diazepam (3 mg/Kg i.v.) inhibited the generalization of the epileptiform activity induced by penicillin (500 units) counteracting the EEG and motor patterns of the ictal events, while did not influence the interictal spike-and-wave complexes. Physostigmine (0.1 mg/Kg i.v.), clonidine (0.1 mg/Kg i.v.), haloperidol (1 mg/Kg i.v.) and naloxone (10 mg/Kg i.v.) did not affect the inhibitory influence of PCP on epileptiform activity due to cortical application of penicillin. Thus, the mechanism of this anticonvulsant action of PCP seems not to depend on the neurotransmitter system related to the reported drugs. The mechanism of action of PCP and KT is discussed in connexion with the similarities of the effects of this drugs in respect to sigma opiate agonists and pentobarbital.", 
    "63": "In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to construct semiquantitative maps of subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic (labeled with [3H]N-methylscopolamine), benzodiazepine ([3H]flunitrazepam), gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]muscimol), dopamine, and serotonin ([3H]spiperone) receptors in frontal cortex, parietal cortex, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus in tissue sections from 5 patients with clinically well-evaluated Huntington's disease and 5 controls matched with respect to age, sex, and postmortem delay. Homogenates were prepared from the remaining cortical and striatal tissue and used to characterize pharmacologically these same receptors, as well as histamine, adenosine, and nitrendipine receptors. Neuronal loss and gliosis were assessed in the contralateral formalin-fixed caudate and putamen. All binding sites measured (except serotonin) were reduced relative to control values in striatum primarily because of changes in the number of receptors rather than in affinity. Autoradiographic studies generally revealed that these changes were greater in the caudate than the putamen, paralleling the more severe neuropathological changes present in the caudate. In addition, autoradiographic studies demonstrated an increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid-related receptors in the globus pallidus. In the cortex, receptor alterations were limited to an increase in the number of benzodiazepine receptors in the frontal cortex which was most prominent in superficial cortical layers.", 
    "64": "An anti-benzodiazepine monoclonal antibody has been used to demonstrate the existence of benzodiazepine-like molecules in the brain. Immunocytochemical experiments show that these molecules are neuronal and not glial and that they are ubiquitously distributed throughout the brain. Immunoblots indicate the presence of benzodiazepine-like epitopes in several brain peptides. Small benzodiazepine-like molecules were isolated from the brain soluble fraction by immunoaffinity chromatography. They block the binding of agonists, inverse agonists, and antagonists to the neuronal-type benzodiazepine receptor. The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid increases the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for the purified endogenous molecules. The results indicate that the immunoaffinity-purified molecules behave like the neuronal-type benzodiazepine receptor agonists. The purified molecules, however, do not inhibit the binding of tritiated Ro 5-4864 to the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor. The results demonstrate the existence of benzodiazepine-like molecules in the brain that bind to the benzodiazepine receptor. These molecules are different from the endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligands reported by others.", 
    "65": "A number of the benzodiazepines (BZDs) inhibit nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner in PC12 cell cultures. The rank order of potency of a series of BZDs for inhibition of neurite outgrowth does not correlate with the order of their affinity constants for the so-called peripheral BZD sites present on PC12 cells. Whereas the inhibition of neurite extension is stereospecific, the binding to the peripheral site is not. The inhibition of neurite outgrowth is not attributable to a blockade of NGF binding to either its fast or slow receptors. Additionally, several other characteristics of NGF stimulation of PC12 cells, such as autoadhesion and the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDCase), remain unaltered in the presence of BZDs. Many BZDs increase OrnDCase levels in PC12 cells in the absence of NGF. The OrnDCase response to BZDs is blocked by actinomycin D. Furthermore, the structural requirements of BZDs for induction of OrnDCase activity is not identical to that for the inhibition of NGF-induced neurite extension. Thus, unlike attenuation of neurite extension, BZD induction of OrnDCase is not stereospecific. Also, some BZDs block neurite growth but do not induce OrnDCase. We propose that there are at least three sites of action of BZDs on PC12 cells. The first is the well-characterized high-affinity peripheral site. The second distinct locus of action results in a blockade of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The structural requirements for the latter effect are essentially indistinguishable from those for BZD induction of hemoglobin synthesis in Friend erythroleukemia cells. The third site of action results in an induction of OrnDCase. Structural requirements for this activity are not identical to those for either the differentiation of Friend cells or the inhibition of neurite outgrowth.", 
    "66": "Ligands that bind to the benzodiazepine receptor have three possible effects. The ligand can be an agonist and reduce anxiety, an antagonist and have no biological effect, or an inverse agonist and promote convulsions. This receptor complex is unique in its spectrum of response to ligands, and conformational changes in the receptor are implicated. The x-ray crystal structure of an imidazobenzodiazepine antagonist ligand, Ro15-1788, was determined and compared to the structures of the 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists and to two other types of antagonists, beta-carbolines and a pyrazoloquinolinone, CGS-8216. The antagonists were found to have similar arrangements of binding features including an aromatic ring, a carbonyl oxygen atom, and a hydrophobic side chain. The structures of these antagonists could be superimposed in a model binding site with three common features for all of the antagonists and a fourth hydrogen-bonding site for the pure antagonists (or inverse agonists), the beta-carbolines, and CGS-8216. A comparison of the shapes of the antagonist benzodiazepine, Ro15-1788, and several agonists showed that RO15-1788 has a unique azepine ring conformation that distorts the usual arrangement of the aromatic A ring, carbonyl oxygen atom, and imine N atom of the agonists. A conformational adjustment in the receptor would be required to accommodate both of these types of ligands. A summary of the superpositions of typical agonists and the antagonists leads to a model with 7 conformationally mobile binding points. Inverse agonists are distinguished from antagonists by the length of the hydrophobic side chain. Antagonists are distinguished from agonists in part by the lack of a binding feature similar to the imine N atom of the diazepine ring. This model accounts for the key features found in ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor and provides an explanation for the spectrum of responses elicited by receptor binding.", 
    "67": "A particulate preparation was obtained by low speed centrifugation of guinea pig cerebral cortical homogenates prepared with a Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Light microscopic examination, using a reflected light differential interference contrast system, reveals the presence of intact neurons, axonal fragments, glial cells, and erythrocytes along with an abundance of small spherical entities (diameter about 1.1 micron) and snowman-shaped entities (diameter of larger sphere about 1.1 micron, diameter of attached smaller sphere about 0.6 micron). Many unattached smaller spherical entities are also present (diameter about 0.6 micron). Pressure filtration through 5- or 10-micron Millipore filters, followed by low speed centrifugation and resuspension, removes most of the larger entities to afford a suspension composed mainly of the small spherical and snowman-shaped entities. Electron microscopic examination reveals the presence of many synaptosomes with attached resealed postsynaptic entities. It is proposed that these correspond to the snowman-shaped entities to be termed synaptoneurosomes. Accumulations of cyclic AMP elicited by 2-chloroadenosine and histamine, and by combinations of 2-chloroadenosine, histamine, norepinephrine, and forskolin, are lower in filtered than in unfiltered preparations, whereas accumulations elicited by forskolin are unchanged. Levels of adenylate cyclase are reduced by filtration, whereas levels of phosphodiesterase are unchanged. Filtration reduces levels of markers for whole cells and endothelial cells, whereas neuronal markers such as acetylcholinesterase activity and norepinephrine uptake are increased. Levels of S-100 protein, a marker for glial cells, are not significantly decreased. There is no apparent change in the density of many receptors or ion channels. Levels of A1-adenosine and H1-histamine receptors are increased, whereas levels of so-called peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites are decreased.", 
    "68": "The effects of agents representing three classes of benzodiazepine receptor-acting drugs on circulating levels of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-END-LI) were examined in male rats. The active benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE, 30 mg/kg), methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (3 mg/kg), and 2-phenylpyrazolo [4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS-8216, 3 mg/kg), all evoked 3- to 4-fold increases in plasma levels of beta-END-LI as compared to control values. The beta-CCE-induced rise in circulating beta-END-LI was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the agonist diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) and the antagonist ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo-[1,5-alpha] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788, 10 mg/kg) but was unaltered by morphine (1 and 5 mg/kg). Ro 15-1788 also significantly attenuated the methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate- and CGS-8216-induced release of pituitary beta-END-LI in vivo. Morphine (5 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg) together, but neither alone, significantly reduced the rise in plasma beta-END-LI due to physical immobilization or foot shock. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (100 micrograms), an inhibitor of pituitary anterior lobe (AL) beta-END-LI secretion, completely prevented the plasma beta-END-LI increase due to beta-CCE. Chromatographic analysis of plasma beta-END-LI revealed that most of the beta-END-LI secreted in response to beta-CCE and CGS-8216 resembles beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH), a marker for beta-END-LI release from the AL, in molecular size. Results of in vitro studies indicate that the effects of the anxiogenic agents, beta-CCE and CGS-8216, on AL beta-END-LI release in vivo were not mediated by direct actions of these agents on the pituitary gland. Together, these findings suggest that an interaction exists between a benzodiazepine receptor mechanism(s) and regulation of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor(s) which in turn controls beta-END-LI secretion from the AL of the rat pituitary gland.", 
    "69": "Replacement of H2O by D2O resulted in significantly higher amount of [3H]diazepam specifically bound to synaptic membranes. The isotope effect arises from increased number of binding sites in D2O and is associated with a stronger solvation of membrane receptors by heavy water.", 
    "70": "Procedures are described for the solubilization of adenosine uptake sites in guinea pig and rat brain tissue. Using [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine [( 3H]NBI) the solubilized site is characterized both kinetically and pharmacologically. The binding is dependent on protein concentration and is saturable, reversible, specific, and high affinity in nature. The KD and Bmax of guinea pig extracts are 0.13 +/- 0.02 nM and 133 +/- 18 fmol/mg protein, respectively, with linear Scatchard plots obtained routinely. Similar kinetic parameters are observed in rat brain. Adenosine uptake inhibitors are the most potent inhibitors of [3H]NBI binding with the following order of potency, dilazep greater than hexobendine greater than dipyridamole. Adenosine receptor ligands are much less potent inhibitors of binding, and caffeine is without effect. The solubilized adenosine uptake site is, therefore, shown to have virtually identical properties to the native membrane site. The binding of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist [3H]cyclohexyladenosine [( 3H]CHA) to the solubilized brain extract was also studied and compared with that of [3H]NBI. In contrast to the [3H]NBI binding site [3H]CHA binds to two apparent populations of adenosine receptor, a high-affinity site with a KD of 0.32 +/- 0.06 nM and a Bmax of 105 +/- 30 fmol/mg protein and a lower-affinity site with a KD of 5.50 +/- 0.52 nM and Bmax of 300 +/- 55 fmol/mg protein. The pharmacology of the [3H]CHA binding site is consistent with that of the adenosine receptor and quite distinct from that of the uptake [( 3H]NBI binding) site. Therefore, we show that the adenosine uptake site can be solubilized and that it retains both its binding and pharmacologic properties in the solubilized state.", 
    "71": "A comparison of the haemodynamic effects of 3 anaesthetic techniques, the combinations etomidate + fentanyl (I), flunitrazepam + fentanyl (II) or midazolam + fentanyl (III), respectively was carried out in 45 patients undergoing various types of cardiac valve replacement surgery. Haemodynamics were assessed by continuously measuring the heart rate as well as the blood pressure in the systemic and pulmonary circulations whereas the cardiac output was measured intermittently. In the first 30 minutes after induction of anaesthesia, a mean arterial blood pressure drop of 10% (I), 20% (II) or 15% (III) respectively, was observed; at the same time, the rate did not change significantly. Cardiac index, however, fell significantly in all 3 groups by 33% (I) 30% (II) or 28% (III), respectively. Pulmonary pressure, wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance rose only in groups I and III and decreased in group II (flunitrazepam + fentanyl). On the other hand, pulmonary vascular resistance as well as left ventricular work index were significantly decreased in all 3 groups. We conclude that all 3 anaesthetic techniques investigated here may be effectively applied for safe induction of anaesthesia in patients with valvular lesions of the heart. On account of the effect of the combination flunitrazepam + fentanyl on decreasing pulmonary artery pressure and wedge pressure, this technique seems to be preferable in patients with pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "72": "Midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and diazepam 0.5 mg/kg were used for induction of anaesthesia in two groups of 10 patients each undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Haemodynamic variables were measured during induction of anaesthesia, after pancuronium and following tracheal intubation. Haemodynamic indices were derived from these measurements using standard formulae. The induction of anaesthesia with midazolam produced a slight but significant increase in heart rate. There was a significant fall in systemic arterial pressure and pulmonary artery pressure following both drugs. Despite the fall in systemic arterial pressure, the cardiac index was maintained in patients who received midazolam. The cardio-stimulatory effect of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation was not prevented by either of the benzodiazepines and morphine in the dosage used. Midazolam is a suitable alternative to diazepam as part of an intravenous induction regimen in patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "73": "The action of midazolam is influenced by serum protein binding as seen in the relationship between the time of onset of action of a fixed dose of the drug and the plasma albumin. Pretreatment with intravenous aspirin produces a decrease in the in vitro binding of midazolam. In vivo this is manifest as an increase in the rapidity of action of the benzodiazepines. Probenecid pretreatment will also cause a decrease in the onset time of midazolam. However, this is not due to altered plasma protein binding of the sedative.", 
    "74": "Camazepam (CZ), a benzodiazepine, was biotransformed to more than ten metabolites. After intravenous and oral administration of these metabolites to rats, CZ, tempazepam (TZ), oxazepam (OZ), and hydroxy CZ (M5) were found to possess pharmacological activities. The brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of CZ and these active metabolites were essentially constant with time after oral administration of CZ. Thus the brain, target organ, was kinetically included in the plasma compartment. The extent of binding of these compounds to plasma protein was independent of concentration tested. Plasma levels of an unchanged drug and its active metabolite(s), and muscle relaxation effect (the impairment of rota rod performance) were measured at 0.5 to 8 h after oral administration of 2 to 3 doses of CZ, TZ, and OZ to rats. When the effect and plasma level data were computer-fitted to a simple Hill equation or a modified Hill equation including competitive factors, the modified Hill equation was found to be adequately applicable to the concentration-effect relation. The parameter values thus obtained could predict the contribution of the administered drug and its active metabolite(s) to the observed pharmacological effect after administration.", 
    "75": "Patients who met DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks underwent dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) before, during, and after treatment with alprazolam or placebo. Similarly, outpatients with major depression were given multiple DSTs as they participated in a study of desmethylimipramine efficacy. The likelihood of an abnormal escape from dexamethasone was similar in the two diagnostic groups; nonsuppression was somewhat more likely among patients with primary depression, but comparisons with agoraphobic groups remained statistically insignificant. These results apparently did not reflect misclassification of primary depression patients as agoraphobics since a history of major depression was not related to the likelihood of nonsuppression within that group. Moreover, change in DST results during treatment reflected clinical change among agoraphobics. After a review of relevant followup and family studies, we conclude that panic disorder and primary depression are separate illnesses and that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity is an epiphenomenon of both.", 
    "76": "Food intake of rhesus monkeys was limited to a single daily 2 hr session of banana flavored pellet availability, seven days a week. Following stabilization of intake, the effects of intragastric bromazepam, diazepam and pentobarbital, when given alone, were determined by delivering a dose twice weekly, 60 min before the session. Dose-dependent increases in food intake were observed with the following descending order of potencies: bromazepam, diazepam and pentobarbital. RO 15-1788 (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, IM), when given alone, five min before the session had no effect on food intake. When given in combination with bromazepam and diazepam, RO 15-1788 completely blocked the increases in food intake observed when the benzodiazepines were given alone. The specificity of this antagonism was shown by the failure of RO 15-1788 to alter the food intake increases induced by pentobarbital. These results confirm and extend previous reports of the specific antagonism of benzodiazepine behavioral effects by RO 15-1788 to an additional species and another behavioral effect of benzodiazepines.", 
    "77": "The effects of various doses of caffeine and of chlor-desmethyldiazepam on footshock-induced aggressive behavior were examined in mice with different baselines of aggressiveness. Caffeine significantly increased the number of fighting episodes with all the doses tested. This was more evident in mice with low rather than in those with high basal rates of agonistic response. Caffeine caused the appearance of minimal convulsive signs in mice subjected to a threshold electroshock which did not produce any seizure in the controls; it also increased metrazol toxicity. Chlor-desmethyldiazepam enhanced fighting behavior at doses of 0.04 and 0.08 mg/kg, but decreased it at 1.25 mg/kg. The first two doses produced the same effects as caffeine on electroshock test, but did not influence metrazol toxicity.", 
    "78": "Nondeprived male rats were familiarized with 30 min daily access to a highly palatable diet. Clonazepam, midazolam and chlordiazepoxide each produced significant dose-dependent increases in food consumption. Clonazepam was the most potent, and a significant hyperphagic effect was detected following 0.078 mg/kg (IP). Amongst novel non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, zopiclone and CL 218,872 also produced significant increases in food intake. The smallest doses to produce significant hyperphagia for these two drugs were 10.0 and 2.5 mg/kg (IP) respectively. In contrast, tracazolate caused only a reduction in feeding, evident at 20 and 40 mg/kg (IP). Previous reports indicate that although benzodiazepines, zopiclone and CL 218,872 displace [3H] flunitrazepam binding in rat cerebral cortex preparations, tracazolate enhances the binding. Our results are consistent with the drug-induced hyperphagia depending upon agonist actions at high-affinity benzodiazepine sites. They also provide pharmacological evidence for a dissociation between hyperphagic and anxiolytic drug effects. Phenobarbital (2.5-40.0 mg/kg), like the benzodiazepines, produced a strong stimulation of food intake, indicating that drug action at an alternative site in the benzodiazepine receptor-GABA receptor-chloride channel complex can also lead to hyperphagia.", 
    "79": "Behavioral and electroencephalographic effects of lormetazepam were investigated in rats, mice and rabbits, in comparison with those of diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam. Locomotor activity of mice in an open-field situation was decreased with large doses of lormetazepam and diazepam, while it was increased with nitrazepam and flurazepam. The anticonflict effect of lormetazepam in rats was much more potent than those of diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam. In suppressing the muricide of olfactory bulbectomized and raphe lesioned rats, lormetazepam was more potent than diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam. Lormetazepam, diazepam and flurazepam prevented both maximal electroshock and pentetrazol convulsions in mice, the effects on the latter being much more potent than those on the former. Lormetazepam was more potent than diazepam and flurazepam in potentiating thiopental-, ether- and ethanol anesthesia, impairing rotarod performance and in muscle relaxant activity. In conscious rabbits with chronically implanted electrodes, lormetazepam induced a drowsy EEG pattern and suppressed the EEG arousal responses not only to auditory stimulation but also to electrical stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation or hypothalamus. Lormetazepam also inhibited afterdischarges induced by electrical stimulation of the hippocampus and amygdala. These results indicate that lormetazepam has pharmacological properties characteristic of benzodiazepines and that the activity is more potent than those of diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam.", 
    "80": "The effects of several compounds believed to act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and which have anticonvulsant or proconvulsant properties when administered in combination with picrotoxin and pentetrazol (leptazol, pentylenetetrazole) were investigated in combination with the convulsant benzodiazepine Ro 5-4864. Tracazolate (25-100 mg kg-1) failed to affect convulsions induced by Ro 5-4864; however, they were prevented by treatment with CL 218,872 (20 mg kg-1). Compounds having proconvulsant activity in combination with a subthreshold dose of Ro 5-4864 were: CL 218,872 (5 mg kg-1), and CGS 8216 (20 mg kg-1) and FG 7142 (40 mg kg-1), two compounds characterized as 'inverse agonists' at benzodiazepine receptors. The phenylquinolines PK 8165 and PK 9084, originally believed to have anxiolytic properties, had no significant effect in combination with Ro 5-4864 (25-100 mg kg-1). The convulsant profile of Ro 5-4864 is compared with that of picrotoxin and pentetrazol.", 
    "81": "The influence of administration of cimetidine (1 g daily for 2 weeks) on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam (0.5 mg t.i.d. for 1 week) and triazolam (0.5 mg nightly for 1 week) was investigated in two groups of 8 healthy subjects. The plasma AUC of these triazolobenzodiazepines were significantly increased. Moreover, for triazolam, the C max was increased and the plasma elimination half-life was prolonged; oral clearance of the two triazolobenzodiazepines was markedly reduced. It is suggested that the combined treatment cimetidine-alprazolam requires a reduced daily dosage (one third) of alprazolam or increased dosage intervals (b.i.d. instead of t.i.d.). For triazolam, used as a hypnotic drug, such dosage reduction appears unsuitable if administered on a once-nightly basis."
