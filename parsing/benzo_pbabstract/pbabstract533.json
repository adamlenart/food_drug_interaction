    "0": "The effects of diazepam on several tests of memory were investigated in a double-blind study of 24 healthy young adults. Following a single oral administration of 0.3 mg/kg diazepam or placebo, subjects in the diazepam group showed marked impairment in immediate free recall of words as compared to placebo control subjects. However, diazepam-treated subjects demonstrated performance benefits from prior exposure to the same words on tests of memory priming using word completion and category-generation tasks. The two types of memory tests differ in their demand for conscious recollection. Tests of free recall have explicit (declarative) memory demands whereas the priming test places only implicit (procedural) demands upon memory. The results demonstrate that diazepam spares some forms of memory as does amnesia induced by neurological impairment.", 
    "1": "The effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam, and inverse agonist, FG 7142, were examined. Strong antagonism between FG 7142 (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg) activity was revealed in the open field test. On the other hand, both FG 7142 and diazepam inhibited isolation-induced intraspecies aggressive behaviour of rats. FG 7142 also reduced interspecies aggression of mouse-killing rats. The findings suggest that both diazepam and FG 7142 have antiaggressive properties in the isolation-induced aggression model, which are mediated by benzodiazepine receptors of the central nervous system.", 
    "2": "The increases in plasma levels of prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) following intravenous administration of the 5-hydroxytryptamine precursor tryptophan (100 mg/kg) were assessed in 30 depressed patients and 30 control subjects. In depressed patients who lost less than 10 lb, PRL responses were significantly reduced compared with controls. In contrast, the PRL responses of patients with weight loss exceeding 10 lb were significantly greater than those of either controls or the other depressed patients. Growth hormone responses to tryptophan were significantly decreased in patients who lost less than 10 lb. Prolactin, but not GH, responses correlated significantly with the postdexamethasone plasma cortisol concentration; however, an apparent relationship between GH and PRL responses and suicidal behavior was probably due to the common factor of weight loss. The results suggest that depressed patients have different types of abnormal 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated neuroendocrine responses that correlate with the presence or absence of severe weight loss and cortisol hypersecretion. Further investigations are needed to establish if these abnormalities are central to the depressive disorder or have implications for treatment response.", 
    "3": "The physiologic roles of the 2 muscarinic receptors (M1 and M2) in the vagal control of pulmonary resistance were studied by comparing the effects of pirenzepine (PZ, M1-blocker), gallamine (GAL, M2-blocker), and atropine (AT, M1- and M2-blocker) on the increase in pulmonary resistance (RL) and on the reduction in heart rate (HR) during bilateral cervical vagus nerve stimulation in 18 anesthetized (chloralose and urethane) and paralyzed (vecuronium) dogs. PZ, AT, and GAL all inhibited the reduction in HR during vagus nerve stimulation, although the inhibition required relatively high doses of PZ and GAL. AT and PZ inhibited the increase in RL during vagus nerve stimulation. The ratio of the dose needed to inhibit by 50% the HR response to the dose needed to inhibit by 50% the RL response was approximately 45:1 for PZ, 12:1 for AT, and less than 0.4:1 for GAL. Thus, compared with AT, PZ is a more selective blocker of vagally induced increases in RL, indicating that M1 receptors are present in the airway smooth muscle of intact anesthetized dogs. In the same dose range as that which caused the inhibition of the HR response, GAL had no consistent effect on the increase in RL during vagus nerve stimulation, indicating that M2 receptors do not mediate the increase in RL in intact anesthetized dogs.", 
    "4": "Seizures that occur in relation to alcohol withdrawal, following a period of prolonged intoxication in serious alcoholics, constitute a special syndrome with important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Inpatient management is desirable to eliminate other causes of seizures that occur for the first time in adult life and because such patients are at substantial risk for additional seizures and the development of delirium tremens. Drug therapy with benodiazepines may be effective during the withdrawal period but long-term anticonvulsant treatment is of no value.",

Organic disorders must be ruled out in this type of patient before functional diagnoses are accepted as diagnoses of exclusion. In this article, a methodical approach to the treatment of the patient's agitation is outlined. If a reversible organic cause for the patient's behavior is not apparent and if the patient does not first respond to verbal communication, then the proper treatment of the patient's agitation includes mechanical and chemical restraints. The article concludes with a review of the pharmacology and indications for use of different classes of sedating agents.", 
    "6": "The case of an obtunded elderly woman is presented. The patient initially was thought to have suffered a cardiovascular accident but was discovered to have taken an overdose of flurazepam hydrochloride. Depression is a common and under-recognized problem in the geriatric population. As a consequence, suicide rates are highest in the elderly. Over- and underdosing of both prescription and nonprescription drugs are common means available to the suicidal elderly patient. These overdoses are often attributed to unintentional patient errors and overlooked for what they are, attempted suicides, or they are missed entirely as a cause of the patient's presentation. This case illustrates the need to consider drug overdose in the obtunded elderly patient.", 
    "7": "Sixty healthy mothers undergoing elective cesarean section received at random either midazolam 0.2 mg/kg or thiopental 3.5 mg/kg with succinylcholine 1 mg/kg for rapid sequence intravenous anesthetic induction. Maintenance of anesthesia was identical in all patients: 50:50 N2O in oxygen, halothane 0.5% and pancuronium 0.05 mg/kg. Hemodynamic responses were similar, as were the biochemical status of mothers and infants, and maternal to fetal blood gas/acid base gradients. Correlation between maternal arterial and fetal (umbilical venous/arterial) pH, PCO2 and base excess values were statistically better with midazolam. However, 1-min Apgar minus color (A-C) scores less than 5/8 (representing \"severe\" neonatal depression) were recorded in five infants after midazolam, three of whom required tracheal intubation, and one whose mother was given thiopental. This difference reached statistical significance (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that midazolam is less suitable than thiopental for anesthetic induction in patients undergoing cesarean section.", 
    "8": "Muscle cells were isolated from the longitudinal muscle layer of guinea pig and human jejunum and used to identify the muscarinic receptor subtype (M1 or M2) that mediates contraction. Single muscle cells were anchored to the ceiling of a minichamber and their contraction was measured in response to acetylcholine, alone and in combination with three muscarinic antagonists: atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), and pirenzepine. Estimates of the inhibitory dissociation constants (Ki) were closely similar in human and guinea pig muscle cells (atropine 2.5-5 X 10(-11) M, 4-DAMP 1.9-2.9 X 10(10) M, and pirenzepine 8.2-9.5 X 10(-8) M). Thus, pirenzepine, a preferential M1 antagonist, was 1900-3280 times less potent than atropine and 279-500 times less potent than 4-DAMP. Comparative measurements on longitudinal muscle strips from guinea pig jejunum confirmed the greater potency of atropine and 4-DAMP relative to pirenzepine. Inactivation of muscarinic receptors on single muscle cells with dibenamine showed that only a small fraction of receptors was responsible for the response to acetylcholine. It was concluded that intestinal muscle cells contain a large reservoir of muscarinic M2 receptors that exhibit considerable spareness and heterogeneity.",

In these 8 patients, the mean absolute IQ discordance between Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance IQ (PIQ) was 17.5 points. Thirty of 38 patients had no adverse behavioral side effects while receiving clonazepam. In these 30 patients, the mean absolute VIQ-PIQ discrepancy was 6.5 points. Full neuropsychological testing had been performed on all patients. The only test variable showing a statistically significant difference was the absolute discrepancy between VIQ and PIQ (P less than 0.0001).", 
    "10": "Propofol, a rapid and short-acting i.v. anesthetic, was associated with the risk of anaphylactic reactions in its original cremophor-EL formulation. It has been reformulated in a soybean emulsion with satisfactory anesthetic properties. A former study of hemodynamic changes after i.v. induction with propofol, thiopental, methohexital, etomidate, and midazolam in patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated that in comparison to other induction agents propofol depressed systolic and diastolic arterial pressures more severely, compromising coronary perfusion. In the present investigation left ventricular parameters as well as hemodynamic effects during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) were studied in comparison to midazolam during opiate analgesia. Methods. Hemodynamic effects of 2 mg/kg body weight propofol as compared to 0.15 mg/kg midazolam were studied in 34 patients during coronary artery surgery before cannulation of the large vessels (measurement of left ventricular parameters) or during ECC (measurement of arterial perfusion pressure and oxygenator volume). Results (see Table 1, Figs. 1 and 2). Propofol decreased systolic and diastolic pressures (-27%, -22%) more than midazolam (-10%, -9%). Cardiac index and stroke volume index were diminished following both drugs (propofol: -14%, -9%; midazolam: -15%, -11%); total systemic resistance was reduced significantly by propofol (-22%). Dp/dtmax was compromised more markedly by propofol (-24%) than by midazolam (-18%), but there was no significant difference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The relationships between occupancy of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on iris sphincter muscle, measured by [3H]quinuclidinylbenzylate (QNB) binding, carbachol (CCh)-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, measured as myo-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) accumulation, myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and contraction were analyzed by examination of the dose-response relationships and the effects of the muscarinic antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine (PZ). CCh caused a concentration-dependent accumulation of IP3 (EC50 = 2.3 X 10(-6) M), MLC phosphorylation (EC50 = 3.8 X 10(-6) M), contraction (EC50 = 0.55 X 10(-6) M) and [3H]QNB displacement [KH (high affinity dissociation constant) = 2.9 X 10(-6) M]. The time course of atropine reversal of CCh-induced IP3 accumulation and muscle contraction revealed that the continued presence of activated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was required to maintain IP3 production and contraction. Atropine was about 2 orders of magnitude more potent than PZ in inhibiting the CCh-induced biochemical and pharmacological responses and [3H] QNB binding, indicating the preponderance of M2 receptors in this smooth muscle. Thus, the PA2 values for atropine antagonism of CCh-stimulated IP3 accumulation, MLC phosphorylation and contraction were 9.1, 9.05 and 9.39, respectively, and for PZ antagonism were 7.12, 7.10 and 7.29, respectively. Furthermore, the KD values for atropine and PZ antagonism of [3H]QNB binding were 6.9 X 10(-10) and 1.5 X 10(-7) M, respectively. In addition, AF-DX116 (11-[(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl) acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6 H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one), a M2 cardioselective antagonist, significantly inhibited the CCh-induced IP3 accumulation and muscle contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "The efficacy and safety of nalbuphine hydrochloride as an IV analgesic used in combination with pretreatment and supplemental doses of diazepam with and without N2O were assessed in 15 patients scheduled to undergo aortocoronary bypass (n = 11) or valve replacement surgery (n = 4). The loading infusion of 3.0 mg/kg nalbuphine given in 20 min 5 min after conclusion of IV injection of 0.4 mg/kg/5 min diazepam caused no significant changes in systolic or diastolic systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressures or in heart rate, cardiac index, stroke index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, or right and left ventricular stroke work index. After the initial 1-hr loading infusion of 6.66 +/- 0.89 mg/kg nalbuphine (mean +/- SE), additional nalbuphine infusion maintenance doses of 4.73 +/- 0.77, 1.87 +/- 0.31, 2.16 +/- 0.23, 1.65 +/- 0.22, and 2.35 +/- 0.44 were used in the subsequent hourly periods to maintain a pain-free state throughout surgery. Hemodynamic changes during the three most stressful periods, tracheal intubation, skin incision, and sternotomy, were not statistically significant. Normal plasma catecholamine and cortisol levels indicate that these patients experienced neither stress nor pain during the maintenance of anesthesia. Nalbuphine caused no significant histamine release. All patients had uncomplicated maintenance of and emergence from anesthesia.", 
    "13": "The effects of L364718, a new CCK receptor antagonist, on CCK-8 stimulated pancreatic secretion and PP release were examined in three conscious dogs with pancreatic fistulas. L364718 (20 nmol/kg) caused a potent inhibition of CCK-8 stimulated pancreatic protein, amylase and trypsin secretion but not of volume and bicarbonate secretion. Release of PP by CCK was also significantly suppressed by L364718. The degree of inhibition by L364718 was dependent upon the amount of CCK-8 infused. This study demonstrates that L364718 acts as a potent antagonist of CCK's action on pancreatic enzyme secretion and PP release in dogs and suggests that this agent might be a useful tool for studying the physiological role of CCK in conscious animals.", 
    "14": "Sleeping time was measured in groups of old and young rats following the intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (39.5 mg.kg-1), diazepam (30 mg.kg-1) and ethanol (3 g.kg-1). Concentrations of pentobarbital, and unbound and total diazepam in serum, and ethanol in breath were quantified; as well as whole brain concentrations of diazepam and N-demethyldiazepam. Healthy old rats slept significantly longer than young rats after receiving diazepam and ethanol but not pentobarbital. There were no significant differences in serum or whole brain concentrations of diazepam or N-demethyldiazepam between healthy young and old rats. There were also no changes in the serum pentobarbital or breath ethanol concentrations between the young and old rats. Increases in pharmacologic effect that occur with aging may be caused by alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters or changes at the site of drug action. The cause of an increased pharmacodynamic effect depends upon the specific drug, possibly because these compounds affect the same receptorionophore complex at different sites.",

The process parameters were compared with the parameters of mouse body distribution of other N1-unsubstituted derivatives of 1,4-benzdiazepine. It was shown that for the original preparation fatty tissue, liver, spleen, myocardium may be referred to the central compartment of the kinetic scheme of distribution. No organ or tissue functioning as the peripheral compartment of the kinetic scheme of the drug distribution was found. The gastrointestinal tract of the experimental animals can serve as the peripheral compartment of the kinetic scheme for products of biotransformation of I.", 
    "16": "Changes in respiratory pattern and arterial PCO2 after three repeated intravenous sedative doses of midazolam 0.05 mg/kg or diazepam 0.15 mg/kg were studied in eight healthy male volunteers in a randomized double-blind crossover design. In order to reduce the influence of the measuring equipment, we utilized a noninvasive computerized technique to measure respiratory variables. Both drugs caused equal changes in breathing pattern with a decrease in tidal volume, an increase in respiratory rate and an unaltered minute ventilation. These alterations in breathing pattern were associated with CO2 retention. Respiratory changes were mainly induced by the first injection of either drug. Despite increased plasma drug concentrations, subsequent doses did not cause further changes in respiratory variables except for an increase in PCO2 after the second dose of midazolam. The clinical significance of these changes in PaCO2 in otherwise healthy individuals is probably limited. The duration of the subjective sensation of sedation was longer after diazepam than after midazolam.", 
    "17": "Pirenzepine and gallamine selectively and differentially antagonized two muscarinic responses, in the superior cervical ganglion of the rabbit, whether elicited by the muscarinic agonist methacholine or by orthodromic stimulation. Methacholine elicited a biphasic ganglionic response, consisting of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing components that were the agonist-induced equivalents of the slow-inhibitory and slow-excitatory postsynaptic potentials elicited by orthodromic stimulation. Superfusion of ganglia with pirenzepine resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of depolarization induced by methacholine with no suppressant action on ganglionic hyperpolarization. In contrast, superfusion of ganglia with gallamine resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of ganglionic hyperpolarization and the slow-inhibitory postsynaptic potential. These effects occurred without appreciable suppression of ganglionic depolarization or the slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential. The action of gallamine was specific for muscarinic hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarizations produced by superfusion with dopamine or norepinephrine were unaffected by gallamine, at concentrations that suppressed the muscarinic slow-inhibitory post-synaptic potential. Incubation with anti-cholinesterases produced a parallel shift, to the right, of concentration-response curves for suppression by gallamine of the slow-inhibitory postsynaptic potential. This was presumably the consequence of an increase in the acetylcholine available for interaction with the muscarinic receptor. The evidence suggests that the ability of gallamine and pirenzepine to suppress selectively the slow-inhibitory and slow-excitatory postsynaptic potentials, as previously demonstrated, is through an action at muscarinic receptors. Furthermore, the data suggest that these pharmacological agents produce their effects by interaction at different muscarinic recognition sites.", 
    "18": "Alprazolam (Xanax) is a fairly new, yet very popular benzodiazepine tranquilizer. In 1985, it was 6th on a nationwide list of drugs mentioned in emergency room drug poisonings. A procedure was developed that allows alprazolam and its main urinary metabolites, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and 3-hydroxymethyl-5-methyltriazolyl chlorobenzophenone, to be detected in urine specimens. A dual capillary column, dual nitrogen detector gas chromatographic system was used for reliable identification. Improved chromatographic performance was obtained by acetylating the metabolites. Method characteristics such as linearity, reproducibility, limit of detection, and recovery were determined. The method was tested by assaying urine specimens from hospitalized patients who had been ingesting alprazolam. In most cases, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam was found in the highest concentration and separated best from endogenous urine substances. A single dose concentration-time study was performed, and the time course of alprazolam and metabolite concentrations over 48 hours was determined.", 
    "19": "Hypothermia and hyperthermia related cases recorded for the period 1973 to 1984 were collected from the files of the Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Oulu, and the necropsy protocols including toxicological results were analyzed. The fact that similar alcohol concentrations were found in both types of fatalities points to the poikilothermic effect of alcohol in humans, as found in animal studies. Both types of deaths seem to be associated with the alcohol elimination phase. Antidepressants and neuroleptics were most often found in the hypothermia cases, but benzodiazepines were also quite frequently present. In spite of the diminished use of barbiturates, these still appear in hypothermia fatalities. Certain other drugs that affect thermoregulation were also noted in solitary cases. Extended toxicological analysis was seldom made in the cases of hyperthermia deaths, and no firm conclusions on the poikilothermic effect of psychotropic drugs could be reached, for example. Therapeutic drug concentrations did not alone predispose the subjects to hypothermia, but appeared in connection with alcohol consumption or chronic diseases.", 
    "20": "A new recessive mutation, spasmodic (spd), producing behavior that mimics that of the neurological mutation spastic (spa) with rapid tremors, stiff posture, and difficulty in righting, arose spontaneously in strain A/HeJ at the Jackson Laboratory in 1979. It is not an allele of spa and linkage tests show that this mutation is located close to vestigial tail (vt) near the center of chromosome 11. Additional genetic tests show that it is not an allele of trembler (Tr), shaker-2 (sh-2), nor vibrator (vb), all neurological mutations located in the same region of chromosome 11. No differences were observed in the levels of the major CNS and PNS myelin proteins or lipids of spd/spd mice versus littermate controls, suggesting that, unlike several closely linked mutations, the spd mutation does not affect myelination. Pharmacological studies reported here show that aminooxyacetic acid improves the behavioral abnormalities of affected spd/spd mice in the same way it improves the behavior of affected spa/spa mice. However, unlike the spa/spa mice, there are no changes in the postsynaptic receptors for glycine, GABA, or benzodiazepines in spd/spd mice.",

    "22": "The pharmacodynamics of midazolam was studied in 27 children undergoing elective surgery at five different dose levels (0.075-0.6 mg/kg) in attempting to find a suitable induction dose for general anesthesia. A comparison of the highest dose was made to thiopentone 5 mg/kg. Even an induction dose of 0.6 mg/kg of midazolam was found to be unreliable in children, but effective enough to cause significant fall in systolic blood pressure after induction (p less than 0.05). In the children premedicated with atropine and pethidine thiopentone resulted in a more rapid closure of the eyes (p less than 0.01) and disappearance of the eye-lid reflex (p less than 0.01) than the high dose of 0.6 mg/kg of midazolam. Moreover, midazolam failed to induce sleep in a considerable fraction of the children even at the highest dose employed. The thiopentone group was more alert in the recovery room at 30 min after wake-up. The amnestic effect of thiopentone and midazolam were equal.", 
    "23": "1. The properties of the muscarinic receptors in the rabbit saphenous artery were determined from electrical and mechanical responses of smooth muscle cells produced by acetylcholine (ACh). The inhibitory action of atropine and pirenzepine on the ACh-induced responses was also studied. 2. ACh produced a transient hyperpolarization of the membrane and inhibited the noradrenaline (NA)-induced contraction. These effects of ACh were apparent only when the endothelial cells were intact. 3. The ACh-induced transient hyperpolarization was antagonized by atropine or pirenzepine, with similar potencies (the ID50 values were about 2 x 10(-8) M for both antagonists). 4. The ACh-induced inhibition of the contraction to NA was antagonized by atropine more preferentially than by pirenzepine (the ID50 values were 2 x 10(-8) M for atropine and 10(-6) M for pirenzepine). 5. The excitatory junction potential (e.j.p.) evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation was inhibited by ACh (above 10(-8) M). The ACh-induced inhibition of the e.j.p. was antagonized by atropine more preferentially than by pirenzepine (the ID50 values were 3 x 10(-8) M for atropine and 6 x 10(-6) M for pirenzepine). 6. It is concluded that in the rabbit saphenous artery, two subtypes of muscarinic receptor (M1 and M2) are located on the endothelial cells. Stimulation of each subtype releases a different substance, i.e., a hyperpolarizing substance (M1-subtype) or a relaxant substance (M2-subtype). In prejunctional nerve terminals, the muscarinic receptors responsible for inhibiting the release of transmitter substances are of the M2-subtype.", 
    "24": "Several authors reported a decrease in metabolism of drugs during inhalational anesthesia. In this study we investigated the influence of several kinds of anesthesia on the metabolism of midazolam. Methods. In 43 patients who underwent minor surgery, anesthesia was induced by injecting 0.2 mg fentanyl followed by 0.15 mg/kg midazolam. Anesthesia was maintained by either halothane/nitrous oxide (group 1), isoflurane/nitrous oxide (group 2), fentanyl/droperidol/nitrous oxide (group 3), or halothane/air/oxygen (group 4). Venous blood was drawn after 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min. Using the two-compartment model we estimated distribution half-life (t1/2a), elimination half-life (t1/2el), clearance (Cl), and volumes of distribution (Vz = volume in elimination phase). Results. There were no significant differences of elimination parameters between the four groups. Elimination half-life ranged from 0.72 to 15.06 h. Cl ranged from 2.5 to 12.8 ml/min per kilogram. Four patients (= 9%) had a t1/2el of 7-15 h; in 16 cases we found secondary concentration peaks. There was no correlation between drowsiness in the postoperative period and midazolam concentration. Conclusion. Even if anesthesia should influence the metabolism of midazolam, for example by reducing liver blood flow, we did not find any difference between the four groups. In accordance with others, we found some patients with a half-life of up to 15 h, which might reflect the influence of the anesthesia itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "This study was designed to determine the effects of sucralfate, De-Nol, and Maalox 70 on gastric HCO3 secretion in 34 healthy humans. Alkaline secretion was measured after pretreatment with ranitidine to abolish H+ secretion, using a constant perfusion-aspiration system and back-titration of the perfusates to the original pH 6.0. Luminal release of PGE2 was also measured in the gastric perfusates. Addition of sucralfate or De-Nol resulted in increments of gastric HCO3 secretion, reaching about 45% and 59%, respectively, of the maximal HCO3 response to 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2). The highest response to Maalox 70 reached about 21% of dmPGE2 maximum. These effects of sucralfate, De-Nol, and Maalox 70 were accompanied by a significant increase in luminal release of PGE2. Pretreatment with atropine reduced basal and, in part, sucralfate-, De-Nol-, and Maalox 70-induced alkaline secretion, whereas pirenzepine did not affect this secretion. Aspirin reduced the release of PGE2 by about 80% and suppressed almost completely the gastric HCO3 response to sucralfate, De-Nol, and Maalox 70. This study provides evidence that sucralfate, De-Nol, and Maalox 70 stimulate gastric alkaline secretion via a prostaglandin-dependent mechanism.",

This study assesses the reactivity of these drugs and their major metabolites in the EMIT d.a.u. benzodiazepine metabolite assay. Analytical standards of drugs and metabolites and urine specimens from patients receiving these drugs were analyzed by EMIT. Alprazolam and alpha-OH alprazolam gave an equivalent response to the EMIT low calibrator between 0.2 and 0.3 microgram/mL. Triazolam and alpha-OH triazolam were reactive between 0.3 and 0.5 microgram/mL. The assay was positive in 24 out of 27 random urine specimens from alprazolam-treated patients and in 8 out of 19 urine specimens from triazolam-treated patients. Positive urine results were confirmed by measuring the major urinary metabolites alpha-OH alprazolam and alpha-OH triazolam by HPLC. The study demonstrates that the EMIT assay can detect significant amounts of alprazolam and metabolites in the urine. The assay was negative in 58% of the specimens from individuals receiving triazolam, however.", 
    "27": "The purpose of this study was to determine if pirenzepine and cimetidine given together was superior to cimetidine alone in inducing healing of refractory duodenal ulcers which remained unhealed after treatment with cimetidine or ranitidine for at least eight weeks. One hundred and thirty one patients from six centres were randomised to receive either cimetidine (C) 800 mg daily or cimetidine 800 mg plus pirenzepine (C + P) 100 mg daily under double blind conditions for six weeks. The healing rate was similar in both groups, irrespective of the method of calculation. On an intent-to-treat analysis, healing was: C 66%, C + P 57%, and amongst the patients who completed treatment, healing was 70% in both groups. Patients on C and on C + P experienced a similar decrease in daytime and in night time pain. Side effects of treatment, notably dry mouth and blurred vision, were reported more often by patients on combination therapy. Combined treatment with cimetidine plus pirenzepine in patients with refractory duodenal ulcer is unlikely to be beneficial.", 
    "28": "The rectal administration of midazolam for premedication of children before induction of anesthesia by mask was investigated in two clinical studies. In 62 children aged between 2 and 10 years, midazolam was given by open design at various dosages (0.15 mg.kg-1, 0.25 mg.kg-1, 0.30 mg.kg-1, 0.35 mg.kg-1, 0.40 mg.kg-1) to evaluate the most effective dose for optimal acceptance of the mask and gas mixture. An additional 40 children between 3 and 9 years received 0.2 mg midazolam.kg-1 body weight or placebo in a double-blind design to estimate the lower limit of efficacy of midazolam. All children were classified as ASA I and had to undergo a surgical procedure. Within the two studies the children were not different with respect to their general data, age, weight, and sex. In both studies more boys than girls were included. Parameters of efficacy were the degree of sedation before and at 10, 20, and 30 min after midazolam as well as acceptance of the mask and the gas mixture at induction of anesthesia. In all groups, including placebo, a sedative and tranquilizing effect of the premedication was found. The rectal administration of 0.35-0.4 mg midazolam.kg-1 is most suitable for the preoperative medication of children between 2 and 10 years. Due to the degree of sedation and the relief of anxiety toward the surroundings and the operation, the induction of anesthesia is optimally accepted by the child. In contrast, the effect of a dose around 0.2 mg midazolam.kg-1 body weight is not much different from that of placebo and is not sufficient for effective premedication.", 
    "29": "Seventy consecutive patients presenting with a clinical diagnosis of chronic muscle contraction headache over a two-year period were evaluated for depression and anxiety scores, along with other possible aetiological factors in this form of headache. Fifty-five of these patients (33 from a hospital neurology clinic and 22 from a local general practice) completed a double-blind study to evaluate flupenthixol 0.5 mg twice daily, diazepam 5 mg twice daily and placebo as prophylactic agents. Patients evaluated in the hospital neurology clinic had more frequent headaches of longer duration, higher analgesic consumption and higher depression, but no higher anxiety scores than those in general practice. Flupenthixol and diazepam were both significantly superior to placebo in reducing headaches and analgesic consumption. The trend was for flupenthixol to be superior to diazepam without reaching statistical significance. Flupenthixol was significantly better than diazepam and placebo in the reduction of Hamilton depression scores. This effect was independent of the effect on headache and analgesic reduction.", 
    "30": "Febrile seizures are common in children. They are associated with disease outside of the central nervous system and are usually generalized, brief and self-limited. History and physical examination are usually sufficient to rule out central nervous system disease, and an extensive laboratory work-up is seldom indicated. Prophylaxis with antiseizure medications is only indicated in certain circumstances. The major risk in one febrile seizure is the increased likelihood of another.", 
    "31": "To further define optimal combinations of antiemetics, high-dose metoclopramide and lorazepam (M+L) were compared with prochlorperazine and lorazepam (P+L) in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Both patient and observer assessments were documented in 66 patients receiving cisplatin and noncisplatin chemotherapy. M+L significantly reduced the severity of vomiting (P = 0.01), duration of vomiting (P = 0.05), and number of vomiting episodes (P = 0.003). Comparing the severity or duration of nausea, M+L and P+L were not significantly different. M+L significantly reduced severity of vomiting (P = 0.005) and number of vomiting episodes (P = 0.03) in the cisplatin subset. The number of vomiting episodes was also reduced in the noncisplatin subset (P = 0.03). When asked to nominate a preferred regimen, 41% of patients preferred P+L, 35% preferred M+L, and 24% rated them equally. M+L was associated with significantly more anxiety and less sedation than P+L. Patient assessments produced similar results to observer assessments but gave a broader understanding of our patients' tolerance to chemotherapy. M+L is a superior regimen in controlling vomiting induced by chemotherapy.", 
    "32": "A personal computer was introduced in conditioned lever-press avoidance experiment in Sidman situation. Experimental data were analyzed with both classic indices such as response rate and shock rate and new indices introduced in this experiment. New indices include sum of squares of shock-shock intervals, mean of shock-response time and number of shock-response time less then 5 sec. Results obtained in diazepam-treated mice were consistent with those reported previously by the classic method. In mannitol-treated mice, significant changes of the avoidance behavior could be detected by both the classic index and our new indices. By the new indices other than classic indices, the effect of administration with sodium chloride on the avoidance behavior could be detected, whereas the classic indices could not detect the effect. Though the meanings of these indices i physiological and toxicological aspects should be appreciated in future study, the experimental system reported in this paper might be applicable in the toxicological research to detect the effect of administration with various substances on the avoidance behavior.", 
    "33": "Sixty nine children suffering from a first febrile seizure without evidence of neurologic disorder or associated risk factors were randomly assigned to one of three groups: no treatment; intermittent rectal diazepam; or continuous oral sodium valproate. All patients were followed for two years. Periodical controls were performed every three months in order to record febrile episodes, recurrent seizures, and treatment side affects. Rate of recurrent febrile seizures was 16% in control group, and 5.5% in diazepam group. Sodium valproate group showed no recurrences in the follow-up period. The low relapsing rate in control group suggests that prophylaxis should not be established even if it is requested by certain parental attitudes.", 
    "34": "The antinociceptive effect of morphine, as determined by the tail-flick test, was dose-dependently increased by the intraperitoneal injection of zopiclone. The benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 (flumazepil) and Ro 15-3505, when intraperitoneally injected, significantly antagonized the effect of intraperitoneal injection of zopiclone on morphine antinociception. Intrathecal injection of zopiclone potentiated morphine antinociception, while the intracerebroventricular injection of zopiclone failed to enhance morphine antinociception and the intracerebroventricular injection of flumazepil to antagonize the intraperitoneal-zopiclone-induced increase in morphine antinociception. These results suggest that benzodiazepine sites are specifically involved in the potentiating effect of zopiclone on morphine antinociception. The anatomical locations of the receptors involved seem to be at the spinal level.", 
    "35": "The effects of chronic treatment with clonazepam and sodium valproate were studied on kindled amygdaloid seizures in rats. Fully kindled rats were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of either vehicle (1.0 ml/kg), clonazepam (0.3 mg/kg) or sodium valproate (200 mg/kg) twice daily for 12 days. Each rat was stimulated through an amygdaloid electrode 30 min after the morning dose. While both drugs initially blocked and kindled seizure (P less than 0.01), the results showed a significant trend (P less than 0.02) in the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam but no significant tolerance to the action of valproate.", 
    "36": "Seven intensive care patients were sedated with prolonged infusion of midazolam. One patient received a continuous infusion of midazolam for the treatment of status epilepticus. A bolus injection of 5 mg was administered, followed by infusion of 4-14 mg/hour depending on the required level of sedation. The length of infusion varied between 80 and 360 hours. The plasma concentrations of the midazolam during infusion were between 500-1000 ng/ml. All the patients were adequately sedated. The plasma elimination half-life of midazolam and its main metabolite, 1-OH-midazolam glucuronide, after stopping the infusion varied from 4-12 hours.", 
    "37": "A technique of midazolam/fentanyl/isoflurane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia, in which the benzodiazepine was antagonised by the specific antagonist, flumazenil, was compared with propofol/fentanyl/nitrous oxide anaesthesia for minor outpatient urological surgery. No significant difference was found in the overall ease of anaesthesia; however, using subjective (linear analogue sedation scales) and objective (letter deletion and simple reflex time) tests, recovery was found to be significantly slower for the antagonised midazolam group. For both groups, the most frequent intraoperative problem was patient movement in response to surgical stimulation and, postoperatively, headache. The midazolam group displayed the greatest degree of residual sedation at the 4-hour time of discharge and on arrival home a significantly larger number of patients in the midazolam group slept for a period. It is likely that the dose of flumazenil chosen (1 mg) was inadequate to completely antagonise the dose of midazolam (mean 17 mg) for the full duration of recovery.",

Acute management is outlined, including indications for lumbar puncture and treatment of the febrile child who is continuing to seize. The usefulness and limitations of the EEG are noted. Factors influencing the likelihood of further febrile seizures and the risk of later epilepsy are reviewed. The pros and cons of continuous and intermittent drug therapies for febrile seizure prophylaxis are summarized. A new double-blind randomized study of intermittent oral diazepam for the prevention of febrile seizure recurrences is described.", 
    "39": "In 72 hospitalized depressed patients afternoon plasma cortisol (15.00-15.20) was measured in three ways: spontaneous (n = 72), 16 h after administration of 2 mg dexamethasone (n = 71) and 2 h after administration of 45 mg oxazepam (n = 28) or 60 mg oxazepam (n = 37). When cortisol values were log-transformed the histograms and probit functions of spontaneous cortisol levels and cortisol levels after oxazepam suppression suggested log-normal distributions. However, for cortisol levels after suppression with dexamethasone the probit function was sigmoidal, suggesting non-normality. In addition the histogram for this parameter had two peaks. The most pronounced suppression with dexamethasone was obtained in patients with low spontaneous cortisol levels. In contrast the somewhat weaker cortisol suppressing effect of 45 or 60 mg oxazepam appeared not to be influenced by the spontaneous cortisol level.",

A transnosographic and epidemiologic analysis of this syndrome was realized on this group of out patients. The statistical study by a factorial analysis of correspondences shows the epidemiological and symptomatic characteristics of inhibition. The endpoints were DSM-III criteria of chronic anxiety, adaptation disorders and functional sexual disorders on the first axis and different types of personality on the second axis.", 
    "41": "The analysis of negative emotiogenic influence in dogs carried out according to dynamics of levels of acetylcholine and catecholamine content in peripheral blood and concomitant changes of the higher nervous activity, allows to conclude about the participation of both cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmitter systems in reactions to this influence with a relative predominance of the first one. In animals with decreased reactivity and with compensatory abilities of the cholinergic system, the same influence leads to enhancement of the specific significance of the reaction of the catecholaminergic system, and especially of its transmitter, noradrenergic component.", 
    "42": "In a randomized study, 20 patients received temazepam 20 mg orally the night before and 20 mg in the morning of an operation performed under spinal analgesia (Group I); 20 patients received flunitrazepam I mg similarly (Group 2). Different aspects of the premedication were evaluated verbally, with the aid of a visual analogue scale, Maddox wing apparatus, the critical flicker fusion threshold test, blood pressure and heart rate measurements, serum and CSF cortisol and plasma ADH measurements, as well as CSF drug level determinations. Clinically, temazepam 20 mg proved to be comparable with flunitrazepam I mg, although the latter more effectively prevented cardiovascular changes and pre-operative hormonal stress reaction. No correlation was found between the CSF drug level (bioassayed by radioreceptor assay) and the clinical response of the two benzodiazepines, nor was there any correlation between the cortisol or ADH levels versus the CSF drug levels. On the whole, flunitrazepam proved to be marginally better than temazepam as an oral premedicant.", 
    "43": "In the present work we have investigated some of the excitatory effects of caffeine in rabbits. Caffeine (5-50 mg/kg i.v.) elicited a cortical EEG desynchronization and an activation of the theta hippocampal rhythm but failed to affect the red nucleus activity. The EEG effects of caffeine were counteracted by L-PIA (1-3 mg/kg i.v.). Caffeine (25-50 mg/kg i.v.) completely reverted the EEG and motor effects due to L-PIA (1-5 mg/kg); the drug also counteracted the cortical and hippocampal EEG modifications elicited by diazepam (1-10 mg/kg), but failed to influence the diazepam-induced effects at the red nucleus level. In addition, caffeine (25 mg/kg) significantly increased the duration of the epileptiform EEG response (afterdischarge) elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus. This caffeine-potentiating effect was reduced by administration of both L-PIA (0.05-2 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg); Ro 15-1788 (1 mg/kg) was unable to affect it. Present data suggest that the analeptic action of caffeine is different from that of the drugs acting through the GABA-benzodiazepine system. Our results show the importance of the limbic system in the excitatory effects of caffeine and suggest that purinergic drugs may have a modulatory role in the control of limbic convulsions.", 
    "44": "The effects of HSR-902, an antimuscarinic agent, on acute gastric mucosal lesions induced by various necrotizing agents, gastric mucus secretion and gastric HCO3- secretion in rats were compared with those of pirenzepine.2HCl (pirenzepine), an antiulcer agent. 1) HSR-902 (10-100 mg/kg), given orally, dose-dependently prevented the gastric mucosal lesions induced by ethanol-HCl (60% ethanol in 150 mM HCl), aspirin-HCl (150 mg/kg of aspirin in 150 mM HCl), 0.6 N HCl and 0.2 N NaOH; and the cytoprotective effects of HSR-902 were almost equal or somewhat more potent than those of pirenzepine. 2) HSR-902 (30 mg/kg, p.o.), like pirenzepine, increased the alcian blue binding to gastric mucosa and both hexosamine and N-acetylneuramic acid in gastric juice and reversed the decrease of alcian blue binding to gastric mucosa in water-immersion stress. 3) HSR-902 (30 mg/kg, p.o.), unlike pirenzepine and atropine sulfate, increased the gastric HCO3- secretion in the pylorus-ligated preparations. 4) The cytoprotective effect of HSR-902 (30 mg/kg, p.o.), when examined using gastric mucosal lesion induced by aspirin-HCl, was not abolished by the pretreatment with indomethacin (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or N-ethylmaleimide (10 mg/kg, s.c.). 5) HSR-902 (30 mg/kg, p.o.) did not influence the gastric mucosal potential difference. These results suggest that HSR-902 is a promising drug for the treatment of gastritis and peptic ulcers.", 
    "45": "Three anesthetic agents (equithesin, metomidate, and ketamine) combined with diazepam were tested in the domestic fowl. Laparotomy and thoractomy were possible with the equithesin/diazepam combination, but only laparotomy was possible with the metomidate/diazepam combination. The combination of ketamine/diazepam did not result in the depth of anesthesia required for surgical procedures. Repeated blood pressure and heart rate measurements were recorded by use of a modified noninvasive Doppler technique. Equithesin/diazepam was our combination of choice for long-duration surgical anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia could be modulated by increasing the dose of diazepam. Metomidate/diazepam was useful when short-term anesthesia was required. In contrast to equithesin/diazepam, the metomidate/diazepam combination provided unstable anesthesia of varying depth and duration. Adverse reactions with metomidate indicated caution when using this drug in chickens; the drug also caused marked bradycardia. Ketamine/diazepam combination cannot be recommended as an anesthetic agent for use in chickens. The combination may be useful for minor surgical procedures or treatment, but not for experimental procedures that involve major surgery. Diazepam alone had a slight tranquilizing effect.", 
    "46": "The utilization of psychotropic drugs is a topic of increasing interest. This paper describes a study of psychotropic drug use in two acute psychiatric in-patient services in Cremona, northern Italy. Almost all patients surveyed received one or more psychotropic drugs, and there was evidence of a substantial level of polypharmacy. Women patients were prescribed more psychotropic drugs than the men, while the relationship between drug prescription and psychiatric diagnosis differed between the two services. During the second phase of the study, the medical staff were aware that their prescribing was being monitored. However, this knowledge appeared to have little effect on their patterns of prescribing. The findings of Barton (1978) are thus not supported.", 
    "47": "In 17 benzodiazepine (BDZ) dependent in-patients a CT scan was performed before initiation of withdrawal therapy. The evaluation of the ventricular to brain ratio (VBR) by standardized and computerized measurements revealed significantly higher mean VBRs for both high- and low-dose BDZ-dependent patients compared to the mean VBR of an age- and sex-matched control group. In addition, the mean VBR of high-dose BDZ-dependent patients (N = 8) was significantly higher than the mean VBR of low-dose BDZ-dependent patients (N = 9). This difference could not be accounted for by the age of the patients or duration of BDZ-dependency and, therefore, suggests a dose-dependent effect of BDZs on the enlargement of internal CSF-spaces. On the other hand, higher values for the width of external CSF-spaces were found to be related to increasing age of the patients and duration of BDZ-dependency.", 
    "48": "Two clinical-pharmacological investigations were performed to give a retrospective and explorative record, based on electroencephalographic parameters, of spindle density and REM distribution in the first and second halves of the night under a short-acting (triazolam) and medium-acting (lormetazepam) benzodiazepine. A further aim was to determine whether a suitable dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine could lead to a REM suppression in the first sleep cycles and a REM compensation in later sleep cycles on the same night. Since sleep spindles are increased and rapid eye movements reduced under benzodiazepines, the two phenomena were respectively taken as indicators of drug effects on NREM and REM sleep. According to the receptor affinity of the two substances, dosages of triazolam and lormetazepam ought to be equieffective in a ratio of about 1:2. Yet clinical experience has shown that a ratio of 1:4 (0.5 mg triazolam vs. 2 mg lormetazepam) gives the doses that are equieffective and which are widely used in clinical practice. The changes in the number of sleep spindles and rapid eye movements documented the different kinetic properties of the two substances. Even after clinically equieffective doses, the changes in the parameters were less marked under lormetazepam than under triazolam. This suggests that the two benzodiazepines different effects on spindle and REM distribution were not attributable to their kinetics, but that pharmacodynamic aspects must also be considered, even if this does not fit in with the prevalent picture of the benzodiazepines mechanisms of action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "In anaesthesia and in the intensive care unit, benzodiazepines have proven safe and effective agents for the induction and maintenance of sedation for a variety of therapeutic goals. However, in these contexts, or in benzodiazepine overdose, it is often desirable to be able to terminate or interrupt sedation without waiting for the effect of the benzodiazepine to become dissipated by normal metabolism and excretion. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. It acts by displacing other benzodiazepines from the receptor site by competitive inhibition. The onset of effect after intravenous administration occurs within 1 to 3 minutes. The optimal dosage is determined for each patient by a dose titration procedure and lies in the range 0.2 to 1.0mg in anaesthesiology, and 0.1 to 2.0mg in intensive care use. Despite its short elimination half-life of around 1 hour, after general anaesthesia or conscious to moderate sedation for short procedures, a single dose of flumazenil is usually sufficient to attain and maintain the desired level of consciousness. After intoxication with high benzodiazepine doses, the duration of effect of a single dose of flumazenil is not expected to exceed 1 hour. In such cases, the period of wakefulness can be prolonged as necessary by repeated low intravenous doses of flumazenil or by infusion (0.1 mg/hour). Flumazenil is well tolerated both systemically and locally. The only adverse events seen with greater frequency after flumazenil compared with placebo were nausea and/or vomiting after general anaesthesia, although the incidence of actual vomiting was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Since these effects were virtually absent in studies of intensive care patients and after sedation for short procedures, and were not seen in tolerability studies in healthy volunteers receiving intravenous bolus doses of up to 100mg, there may be a link between these symptoms and the other agents used in general anaesthesia, some of which have well-known emetic properties. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, either alone or in combination with other agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Propofol, in both its new oil-in-water emulsion and the former cremophor-EL solution, is known to produce significant decreases in arterial blood pressure. The aim of this study was to obtain a precise hemodynamic profile of anesthesia induction with propofol under conditions of daily routine (additional 70% nitrous oxide) and to evaluate the influence of (1) premedication with lormetazepam and (2) additional i.v. injection of fentanyl. Forty patients (ASA classes I and II) were randomly assigned to one of four groups (A, B, C, and D). Anesthesia was induced with a sleep dose of propofol (mean: 2.4 mg/kg) and the patient was ventilated with 30% O2 and 70% N2O via a face mask. In groups B and D, 3 micrograms/kg fentanyl were injected immediately prior to propofol injection. Patients in groups A and B received no premedication. Patients in groups C and D received 2 mg lormetazepam on the evening prior to the anesthetic and 1 mg 2 h prior to the anesthetic orally. The following parameters were determined immediately prior to induction of anesthesia and 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 min after the start of the propofol injection: heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary occlusion pressure (POP), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). In all four groups a slight decrease in HR and SVR occurred while a marked decrease in arterial blood pressure (SAP, MAP, DAP) and cardiac output was seen. PAP and preload pressures showed no significant changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "While benzodiazepines have been widely used in adult populations, their role in the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents has not been well established. The authors report on two cases in which benzodiazepine use resulted in psychotic symptoms. The importance of eliciting a careful history as well as being familiar with drugs' side effects and withdrawal effects is stressed.", 
    "52": "Hyperventilation syndrome and panic disorder are both common, serious, and easily treatable disorders. The similarity of their symptoms and physiology, the demonstration of hyperventilation during spontaneous and laboratory-induced panic episodes, provocation of panic-like symptoms in some patients with panic disorder using hyperventilation, the importance of psychologic factors in producing hyperventilation, and successful treatment of panic disorder with breathing retraining all indicate a strong association between these two conditions. About 50 percent of patients in each group show evidence of both disorders. It is suggested that many patients in each group show evidence of both disorders. It is suggested that many patients with either diagnosis have the same disorder and share a biologically and often genetically determined hypersensitivity of a central \"alarm\" system. Panic and hyperventilation provoked by inappropriate activation of this system are postulated to reinforce each other by a positive feedback loop. Treatments directed at any part of this loop are likely to be successful. Clinical implications of the link between these conditions are discussed.", 
    "53": "4 benzodiazepine sedatives, namely diazepam, medazepam, midazolam and bromazepam were investigated for their effects upon the fidelity of cell division in both low passage number and immortalised Chinese hamster cell lines. The study revealed substantial differences in the effect of these structurally related drugs upon mitosis, which may reflect different mechanisms of action of the drugs in cultured cells. Diazepam and medazepam exposure of immortal and low passage number cells resulted in the formation of monopolar mitotic spindles and subsequent metaphase arrest. The production of these spindles may be explained by the inhibition or centriole separation . In contrast, midazolam and bromazepam failed to produce observable changes in spindle structure. All 4 benzodiazepines produced significant toxicity in low passage number cells whereas, immortalised cells were more resistant to their toxic effects. They all induced metaphase chromosome dislocations in immortalised cells, whereas only diazepam and medazepam produced such effects in the low passage number cell line. In general, immortal cells appeared to be less sensitive to the toxic effects of benzodiazepines than the low passage number cells.", 
    "54": "Triazolobenzodiazepines are in clinical use as hypnotics and anxiolytics. We analyzed in vivo receptor binding and brain concentrations of alprazolam, triazolam, and estazolam. Drug concentrations measured in the cerebral cortex 1 h after administration were directly proportional to dose for all three compounds. In vivo receptor binding, as defined by the specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788, decreased with increasing doses of estazolam and triazolam, a finding indicating dose-related increases in receptor occupancy due to these compounds. Triazolam was substantially more potent, with an IC50 value of 16 ng/g, compared with 117 ng/g for estazolam. At higher doses of alprazolam (greater than 0.2 mg/kg), receptor binding by [3H]Ro15-1788, likewise decreased with increasing dose of the former drug. However, at lower doses of alprazolam (0.02-0.05 mg/kg), which resulted in cortex concentrations of 2-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased above control values in cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus but not in several other brain regions. Binding returned to control values at doses of greater than or equal to 0.01 mg/kg. Similar results were obtained in time course studies. At 8 and 10 h after a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p., corresponding to cortex concentrations of 2.7-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased compared with controls. Similarly, at 1, 2, and 3 h after a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg, corresponding to cortex concentrations of 3.7-5.8 ng/g, receptor binding was also increased. The apparent affinity of benzodiazepine receptors for clonazepam in mice receiving alprazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was unchanged from that in untreated control mice, an observation suggesting that low doses of alprazolam increased receptor number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Some of these compounds had affinity for the benzodiazepine receptors in vitro and in vivo radioligand displacement assays. These compounds did not have any anticonvulsant properties and were not active in pharmacological tests predictive of antianxiety activity, but antagonised the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effects of diazepam and had proconvulsant properties.", 
    "56": "Adult male Long Evans were selected as ethanol preferring rats (DR) during 28 days. After this period, they were daily IP injected during 14 days with one of the next drugs: diazepam 1 mg.kg-1, alprazolam 1 mg.kg-1 (benzodiazepines), progabide 25 mg. kg-1 (GABA A and B agonist), nipecotic acid 150 mg.kg-1 (GABA uptake inhibitor), muscimol 0.2 mg.kg-1 (GABA A agonist), AOAA 10 mg.kg-1 (GABA decarboxylase inhibitor), baclofen 3 mg.kg-1 (GABA B agonist), or NaCl 0.9% (1 ml/200 g). During treatment, rats were isolated, had free access to food, and free choice between ethanol (12%) and water whose respective consumption were daily noted. Among treatments, only AOAA and baclofen were able to decrease significantly ethanol intake, without modifying total liquid intake. The action of these different drugs on GABA transmission and on ethanol intake was discussed. It was concluded that GABA A and benzodiazepine receptors were not implicated in ethanol intake, but that modulation of voluntary ethanol intake could be associated with a modification of GABA metabolism and/or stimulation of GABA B receptors. An intervention of GABA B receptors on noradrenergic pathways was also evoked.", 
    "57": "The effects of 3, 6 and 48 mg/kg of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 on the ethanol-induced depressant action were evaluated in mice. These results support and extend previous findings in experimental animals and show that Ro 15-1788 in doses devoid of intrinsic effects, does not antagonize the motor impairment, hypnotic effect or lethality induced by ethanol.", 
    "58": "Benzodiazepine-binding, immunoglobulin G class antibodies have been raised in three rabbits immunised with a conjugate of kenazepine coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin. The antibodies were assayed by [3H]flunitrazepam binding, followed by adsorption onto Staphylococcus aureus cells. Measurement of the rates of association and dissociation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding, together with saturation analysis of equilibrium binding, revealed varying degrees of heterogeneity in the affinity constants of the three rabbit antisera (equilibrium KD values 0.18 to 4.13 nM at 20-22 degrees). Specificity of the antibodies was investigated by testing a wide variety of compounds (at concentrations of up to 10-100 microM) for their ability to inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Only benzodiazepines known to act as agonists at their receptor sites in the central nervous system (CNS) caused an inhibition of binding. The rank orders of the IC50 values of these drugs for inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to IgG from two out of the three rabbits correlated significantly with that previously published for displacement of CNS receptor binding. The agonist beta-carboline derivative ZK 93423, the anxiolytic cyclopyrrolones suriclone and zopiclone and the purines inosine and hypoxanthine all failed to inhibit antibody binding, supporting previous suggestions that these drugs may bind at non-benzodiazepine recognition sites on the CNS receptor. The antibodies described are expected to provide useful reagents for raising anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against the CNS receptor and for the identification and purification of possible endogenous benzodiazepine receptor agonists in the CNS.", 
    "59": "The interaction of [3H]flunitrazepam and its modulation by various drugs was studied in intact primary cultured spinal cord neurons. In the intact cells, the [3H]-flunitrazepam binding was rapid and saturable. The benzodiazepine binding sites exhibited high affinity and saturability, with an apparent KD of 6.1 +/- 1.6 nM and Bmax of 822 +/- 194 fmol/mg protein. The association and dissociation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding exhibited monoexponential kinetics. Specifically bound [3H]flunitrazepam was displaced in a concentration-dependent manner by benzodiazepines like flunitrazepam, clonazepam, diazepam, Ro 15-1788, and beta-carbolines like methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3'-carboxylate. Specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding to intact cells was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists and drugs which facilitate GABAergic transmission like etazolate, (+)-etomidate, and pentobarbital. The enhancing effect of GABA agonists was antagonized by bicuculline and picrotoxinin. These results suggest that the intact cultured spinal cord neurons exhibit the properties of benzodiazepine GABA receptor-ionophore complex. Since these cells can also be studied in parallel for characterizing GABA-induced 36Cl-influx, they provide an ideal in vitro assay preparation to study GABA synaptic pharmacology.", 
    "60": "The binding of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 to membrane preparations from cerebral cortex and peripheral tissues of various species was studied. [3H]PK 11195 (0.05-10 nM) bound with high affinity to rat and calf cerebral cortical and kidney membranes. [3H]Ro 5-4864 (0.05-30 nM) also successfully labeled rat cerebral cortical and kidney membranes, but in calf cerebral cortical and kidney membranes, its binding capacity was only 3 and 4%, respectively, of that of [3H]PK 11195. Displacement studies showed that unlabeled Ro 5-4864, diazepam, and flunitrazepam were much more potent in displacing [3H]PK 11195 from rat cerebral cortex and kidney membranes than from calf tissues. The potency of unlabeled Ro 5-4864 in displacing [3H]PK 11195 from the cerebral cortex of various other species was also tested, and the rank order of potency was rat = guinea pig greater than cat = dog greater than rabbit greater than calf. Analysis of these displacement curves revealed that Ro 5-4864 bound to two populations of binding sites from rat and calf kidney and from rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and calf cerebral cortex but to a single population of binding sites from cat and dog cerebral cortex. Using [3H]PK 11195 as a ligand, the rank order of binding capacity in cerebral cortex of various species was cat greater than calf greater than guinea pig greater than rabbit greater than dog greater than rat, whereas when [3H]Ro 5-4864 was used, the rank order of binding capacity was cat greater than guinea pig greater than rat greater than rabbit greater than calf greater than dog.",

The receptor complex in solution retains the characteristic facilitation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding induced by GABA, the pyrazolopyridine cartazolate, and the depressant barbiturate pentobarbital to the same extent as that observed in synaptosomal membranes. Furthermore, these responses are retained both quantitatively and qualitatively when this preparation is stored for 48 h at 4 degrees C. This is contrary to the results obtained with a CHAPS-soluble preparation including asolectin in which these responses are anomalous and extremely labile on storage.", 
    "62": "Three separate, but allosterically interacting, sites on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supramolecular complex in the brain were pharmacologically blocked in rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy due to galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure to determine whether decreased GABAergic neurotransmission can ameliorate the syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy. Bicuculline (a GABAA receptor blocker), Ro 15-1788 (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), or isopropylbicyclophosphate (a chloride channel blocker) consistently induced a transient but unequivocal decrease in the clinical severity of the encephalopathy and also corrected the abnormal pattern of the visual evoked response associated with hepatic encephalopathy. Rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy exhibited increased resistance to the convulsive effects of bicuculline. In encephalopathies induced in rabbits by gamma-vinyl-GABA (an inhibitor of GABA catabolism) or diazepam (a benzodiazepine receptor agonist), abnormalities of the visual evoked response similar to those found in hepatic encephalopathy occurred and were corrected by bicuculline and Ro 15-1788, respectively. These findings suggest that in hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure (a) there is increased GABAergic tone, (b) an amelioration of encephalopathy can be induced by blockade of GABA or benzodiazepine receptors, (c) benzodiazepine receptor antagonists may be of clinical value in the management of hepatic encephalopathy, and (d) an endogenous substance with GABA potentiating properties may be present in hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "63": "Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor density, affinity, and function, and plasma GABA-like activity were determined in rats with acute hepatic encephalopathy induced by an intraperitoneal injection of thioacetamide. In addition, the effect of various stress factors on brain GABA binding was assessed. Plasma GABA-like activity was significantly increased in rats with thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy compared with rats injected with vehicle alone (1506 +/- 993 nM, n = 7 vs. 367 +/- 97 nM, n = 9, mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001). In contrast, there were no alterations in either brain GABA receptor binding or in GABA-enhanced benzodiazepine binding in rats with hepatic encephalopathy when compared with relevant controls. However, rats that had received intraperitoneal injections of thioacetamide or vehicle (0.15 M NaCl) had significantly more low-affinity GABA receptors than rats that had neither been injected nor handled before killing (8769 +/- 1101 vs. 2710 +/- 757 fmol/mg protein, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). We concluded that stress factors appear to be important causes of altered brain GABA binding. Brain GABA receptor binding and function, however, are unaltered in rats with thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy despite elevated plasma GABA-like activity.", 
    "64": "1. The effects of intracarotid administration of Bay K 8644 on the ECG pattern along with their reversal by antianginal drugs were investigated in anaesthetized rats. 2. Intracarotid injections of Bay K 8644 (0.5-50.0 micrograms kg-1) produced a dose-related transient increase in systemic blood pressure. 3. The pressor response was accompanied by ST segment elevation (0.5-10.0 micrograms kg-1), ST segment depression concomitant with the occurrence of arrhythmias (20.0 micrograms kg-1), or A-V block (50.0 micrograms kg-1). 4. ST segment elevation reached its maximal value within 15 s and could be observed for 30-240 s. 5. The increase in blood pressure was immediate (within 5 s) and short lasting (30-120 s). After the initial increase it returned to control levels (0.5-20.0 micrograms kg-1) or dropped below (50.0 micrograms kg-1). 6. The ST segment elevation caused by 5.0 micrograms kg-1 Bay K 8644 (submaximal dose) was blocked by antianginal drugs (e.g. nitroglycerin, nifedipine and diltiazem) and by the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist PK 11195. However, the pressor response was not blocked by any of the drugs used. 7. ST segment elevation (or depression) induced by intracarotid administration of Bay K 8644 provides a useful tool for the evaluation of potential antianginal drugs.", 
    "65": "Sedative/hypnotic drugs for the treatment of chronic insomnia are generally considered ineffective by most experts but helpful by many patients. Occasionally, insomnia-induced debilitations may be remedied by long-term use of sedative/hypnotic drugs; some examples are given. The present discrepancy between expert and patient opinion may be derived from current research practices. The improbability that series of sedative/hypnotic drug trials will be carried out for patients with insomnia further biases against observation of rarer but clinically significant distinctions among these drugs.", 
    "66": "A sensitive, simple high-performance liquid chromatographic assay, capable of simultaneously measuring diazepam, its active metabolites oxazepam, temazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam and two phenyl hydroxylated metabolites, 4'-hydroxy-N-desmethyldiazepam and 4'-hydroxydiazepam, is described. The assay is easily modified to include separation of additional metabolite(s), e.g. oxazepam glucuronide(s). A thin-layer chromatographic assay, which resolves diazepam, the active metabolites and the two phenyl hydroxylated derivatives in one solvent system, is also reported. Application of these procedures to the quantitation of diazepam and its metabolites was shown, after delivery of diazepam (5 micrograms/ml or 16 microM) at a constant flow-rate (10 ml/min per liver) through the single-pass perfused rat liver preparation. Blood perfusion medium and bile were analysed for parent drug and metabolites before and after enzyme hydrolysis. These assay methods are found to be particularly pertinent and useful in providing a more comprehensive metabolic profile of diazepam metabolism, especially when aromatic hydroxylation pathways predominate.", 
    "67": "A simple, sensitive and specific assay was developed for the determination in plasma and urine of 6-(2'-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha] [1,4]benzodiazepine- 3-carboxamide, compound I, a mixed agonist-antagonist anxiolytic agent. A hexadeuterated analogue of the compound was added to plasma or urine as the reference standard. The titled compound was extracted with benzene at pH 11. Following evaporation of the solvent, the residue was reacted with pentafluoropropionic anhydride in the presence of triethylamine. The derivatizing reagents were evaporated, and the carbonitrile derivative of the analyte was extracted into ethyl acetate at pH 11. The residue remaining after removal of the ethyl acetate was silylated with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, and a portion of this solution was analyzed by gas chromatography-negative-ion chemical-ionization mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer was set to monitor, in the gas chromatographic effluent, the M-. ion of the titled compound and its hexadeuterated reference standard. The ratio of these two ions was calculated and converted to a concentration of analyte using a calibration curve that was generated from the analyses of control plasma fortified with various amounts of analyte and a fixed amount of the hexadeuterated reference standard. The limit of quantitation of the assay was 1 ng/ml for plasma and urine.", 
    "68": "The antimuscarinic effects of BHC-9C (N,N'-bis[6-[(2-methoxybenzyl)amino]hexyl]-1,9-nonanediamine tetrahydrochloride), a member of a series of polymethylene tetraamines with unprecedented in vitro selectivity for cardiac muscarinic M2 receptors, were assessed in several in vivo test systems. BHC-9C (300 micrograms/kg i.v.) proved to be a potent antagonist at cardiac M2 receptors that mediate the decrease in heart rate in the pithed rat. In contrast, it displayed no considerable blocking activity at vascular M2 receptors subserving vasodepression and at ganglionic M1 receptors that mediate cardiovascular stimulation in the anaesthetized and pithed rat, respectively. These in vivo data are consistent with the suggestion based on in vitro experiments that BHC-9C is a highly selective antagonist of cardiac muscarinic M2 receptors.", 
    "69": "Administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, [3H]Ro 15-1788, to mice intravenously was found to label these receptors in brain. Binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in vivo was strongly blocked by pretreating mice with clonazepam or diazepam. Marked enhancement of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in vivo was induced by progabide or sodium valproate. This effect was greater than a similar enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. The increased membrane-bound [3H]Ro 15-1788 elicited by progabide was completely dissociated on subsequent incubation with Ro 15-1788, diazepam or clobazam, indicating that the enhanced binding occurred at benzodiazepine receptors. Compounds that exert diazepam-like actions and/or indirect GABAergic activity (cartazolate, pentobarbital, methaqualone, levonantradol, phenytoin) elicited enhancement of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in vivo. Other CNS agents (atypical neuroleptics, GABA antagonists, baclofen, some 5-HT1 agonists) also induced elevation of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in vivo, as did drugs exerting vasodilatatory effects (papaverine, nimodipine, verapamil, prazosin, N6-cyclohexyladenosine). Possible explanations for enhancement of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in vivo include increase in the number of benzodiazepine receptors induced by GABA or GABAergic drugs or effects of binding enhancers that elevate brain levels of [3H]Ro 15-1788, such as accelerating cerebral blood flow, competing for radioligand binding sites in plasma or increasing metabolic stability of the radioligand.", 
    "70": "Previous electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that non-dopaminergic (non-DA) neurons within the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) are extremely sensitive to the inhibitory effects of GABA and GABA-mimetic drugs, including benzodiazepines, whereas dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) are less sensitive to these compounds and may be influenced indirectly by SNR neurons. The interactions between A10 DA and non-DA neurons within the adjacent ventral tegmental area (VTA) are not as well characterized. In the present experiments, single unit recording and microiontophoretic techniques were used to determine the effects of benzodiazepines on DA and non-DA neurons in the VTA of chloral hydrate anesthetized rats. Diazepam, administered intravenously (i.v.), potently inhibited non-DA, SNR-like cells within the VTA. The effects of diazepam on A10 DA cells were more variable than those observed on non-DA, SNR-like cells in this region, but 77% of such cells showed moderate to marked excitation. Both of these effects were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788; on many cells, this agent produced marked rebound effects beyond the original basal firing rates. However, when administered alone, Ro 15-1788 exerted no effect on either cell population. Microiontophoretic administration of the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam resulted in marked inhibition of non-DA SNR-like cells, but produced either mild inhibition or no effect on A10 DA cells; excitation of DA cells was never observed even though the same neuron was excited by i.v. diazepam. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines act directly upon non-DA, SNR-like cells in the VTA to produce inhibition of activity and a disinhibition of A10 DA cells. This relationship makes it unlikely that benzodiazepines would enhance feedback inhibition of DA cells following neuroleptic administration. In fact, when administered following haloperidol, i.v. diazepam failed to reverse haloperidol-induced increases of A10 DA cell firing; if anything, diazepam further depolarized the cell. If antipsychotic drugs produce their clinical effects, in part, by inducing depolarization inactivation of DA cells, then benzodiazepines might be a useful adjunctive therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "71": "Central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors were analyzed in several brain areas of rats (n = 8-9) that had been treated for five days with CGS 8216 (20 mg/kg per day). Twenty-four hours after cessation of drug treatment a significant decrease of central-type benzodiazepine receptors as labeled by [3H]beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester ([3H]beta CCE) and [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ), but not of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors as labeled by [3H]RO 5-4864 could be observed in the animals treated with CGS 8216.", 
    "72": "Exposure of conscious young rats to 4 h heat stress at 38 degrees C in B.O.D. incubator was associated with increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in 14 brain regions studied. In the same regions cerebral flow (CBF) diminished by 4-65%, but the magnitude of flow reduction was not correlated with the degree of increased BBB permeability. On the other hand, a correlation was observed with increased plasma and brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels. p-Chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA), indomethacin and diazepam pretreatment prevented both the increased BBB permeability and 5-HT levels following heat exposure. Whereas cyproheptadine and vinblastine pretreatment prevented the increased BBB permeability alone. The probable mechanism(s) underlying the BBB permeability is discussed.", 
    "73": "The ability of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-1788 to displace diazepam from brain membranes in vitro and to antagonize the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam in vivo was determined in epileptic fowl. At doses of 1.0 mg/kg and higher, Ro 15-1788 significantly attenuated the anticonvulsant action of diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) in epileptic chickens. Ro 15-1788 alone exerted no anticonvulsant activity even in doses as high as 10 mg/kg. Specific binding of 10 nM [3H]diazepam to whole homogenate fractions prepared from cerebral hemispheres of epileptic fowl was inhibited by Ro 15-1788 with an IC50 of 8.5 nM and the Ki was determined to be 4.25 nM. These results suggest that Ro 15-1788 competes directly with diazepam for a binding site involved in producing anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "74": "Bilateral intrastriatal injection of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5), that blocks glutamatergic transmission at the N-methyl-d-aspartate preferring receptor, induces sniffing and body turns and reduces grooming in rats. Timelotem, a representative of the newly developed chemical class of anellated benzodiazepines antagonized specifically AP-5-induced sniffing and body turns. Classical (haloperidol) as well as atypical (clozapine) neuroleptics had recently been shown to antagonize AP-5-induced sniffing; clozapine, like timelotem, but not haloperidol, additionally antagonized AP-5-induced body turns. Further, timelotem antagonized amphetamine-induced stereotyped behaviour in rats, but was found less active than haloperidol in this test. Comparing the activity of drugs in both paradigms revealed that haloperidol inhibited AP-5-induced sniffing and amphetamine-induced stereotypies within the same dose range, but timelotem and clozapine were found more potent in the AP-5 test than in the amphetamine test. Thus, detailed drug profiles discriminate timelotem and clozapine from haloperidol, linking timelotem again to atypical antipsychotic compounds."
