DZ, a widely administered sedative and muscle relaxant, was proposed to act as an aneugen by disturbing spindle function in various assay systems. Male mice were treated by oral intubation with 3mg/kg DZ once or daily for 14 consecutive days. At 22 days after the last treatment, epididymal sperm were collected from the caudae epididymes. Evaluation of aneuploid and diploid sperm (10,000 sperm per animal) was performed by multicolor FISH employing DNA probes specific for chromosomes X, Y, and 8 simultaneously. We found a significant increase in the frequency of disomy 8 in subchronically DZ-treated mice when compared to the concurrent solvent control group (2.4-fold; P<0.01), while no increase was detected for sex-chromosome hyperhaploidies. No effect was seen when mice were treated with a single dose (3mg/kg DZ). In a parallel human approach, two men were evaluated who chronically ingested >0.3mg/kg/d DZ for more than 6 months. Multicolor FISH was applied to human sperm probing for chromosomes X, Y, and 13. Frequencies for sperm with disomy 13, disomy X, and total sex-chromosomal disomies were found to be elevated among the two subjects after chronic DZ-exposure compared to control subjects. In conclusion, the results indicate that diazepam acts as an aneugen during meiosis in male spermatogenesis, both in mice and humans. The quantitative comparison indicates that humans may be at least 10 times more sensitive than mice for aneuploidy induction by DZ during male meiosis.", 
    "1": "Case reports have described elevated concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. cyclosporin) during metronidazole treatment. Therefore, we wanted to study whether metronidazole affects CYP3A4 activity, using midazolam as a model substrate in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "2": "In the in vitro part of the study, the effects of various concentrations of metronidazole (0-500 microM) on the formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam from midazolam were studied using human liver microsomal preparations (n = 4). In the in vivo part, the effects of metronidazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral midazolam were evaluated in a randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over study in ten healthy subjects. The subjects took either 400 mg metronidazole or matched placebo orally twice daily for 3 days. On day 3, 15 mg midazolam was administered orally. Plasma concentrations of midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were determined up to 24 h. The effects of midazolam were measured up to 10 h.", 
    "3": "Metronidazole (10-500 microM) showed no inhibitory effect on 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation by human liver microsomes. In healthy volunteers, metronidazole had no statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam, and also the ratio of 1'-hydroxymidazolam to midazolam in plasma remained unchanged by metronidazole. The four employed psychomotor tests did not show significant differences between the metronidazole and placebo phases.", 
    "4": "Metronidazole had no effects on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam in vitro or on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam in vivo. These findings indicate that metronidazole is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4.", 
    "5": "Diabetic patients have a 20% higher risk of depression than the general population. Treatment with antidepressant drugs can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with hypoglycemic agents. The treatment of depression in diabetic patients must take into account variations of glycemic levels at different times and a comparison of the available antidepressant agents is important. In the present study we evaluated the interference of antidepressants with blood glucose levels of diabetic and non-diabetic rats. In a first experiment, male adult Wistar rats were fasted for 12 h. Imipramine (5 mg/kg), moclobemide (30 mg/kg), clonazepam (0.25 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) sertraline (30 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered. After 30 min, fasting glycemia was measured. An oral glucose overload of 1 ml of a 50% glucose solution was given to rats and blood glucose was determined after 30, 60 and 90 min. Imipramine and clonazepam did not change fasting or overload glycemia. Fluoxetine and moclobemide increased blood glucose at different times after the glucose overload. Sertraline neutralized the increase of glycemia induced by oral glucose overload. In the second experiment, non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were fasted, and the same procedures were followed for estimation of glucose tolerance 30 min after glucose overload. Again, sertraline neutralized the increase in glycemia after glucose overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. These data raise the question of whether sertraline is the best choice for prolonged use for diabetic individuals, because of its antihyperglycemic effects. Clonazepam would be useful in cases with potential risk of hypoglycemia.", 
    "6": "We present a general approach to the design, docking, and virtual screening of multiple combinatorial libraries against a family of proteins. The method consists of three main stages: docking the scaffold, selecting the best substituents at each site of diversity, and comparing the resultant molecules within and between the libraries. The core \"divide-and-conquer\" algorithm for side-chain selection, developed from an earlier version (Sun et al., J Comp Aided Mol Design 1998;12:597-604), provides a way to explore large lists of substituents with linear rather than combinatorial time dependence. We have applied our method to three combinatorial libraries and three serine proteases: trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. We show that the scaffold docking procedure, in conjunction with a novel vector-based orientation filter, reproduces crystallographic binding modes. In addition, the free-energy-based scoring procedure (Zou et al., J Am Chem Soc 1999;121:8033-8043) is able to reproduce experimental binding data for P1 mutants of macromolecular protease inhibitors. Finally, we show that our method discriminates between a peptide library and virtual libraries built on benzodiazepine and tetrahydroisoquinolinone scaffolds. Implications of the docking results for library design are explored.", 
    "7": "We report two patients who developed progressive, severe, painless radial neuropathies (bilateral in one, unilateral in the other) as a delayed complication of chronic intramuscular analgesic injection. In each instance, exploration of the radial nerve revealed multifocal entrapment within a densely fibrotic triceps muscle at sites between the spiral groove and distal course of the radial nerve near the elbow. Release of the nerve from constriction within the fibrotic triceps muscle produced improvement in all three affected nerves.", 
    "8": "The effects of 2.5 or 5 mg diazepam (DIZ) on the sleep spindles were studied in 12 healthy male subjects. Polygraphic recordings and the state anxiety scale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were made for 6 consecutive nights. An inert placebo was given on the first 3 nights and on the sixth night, and DIZ was administered on the fourth and fifth nights. DIZ produced increases in the amount of the slow and fast spindles in a dose-dependent manner. DIZ dose-dependently lowered the frequency of the fast spindles and elevated that of the slow spindles. Furthermore, the influence of DIZ on fast spindles was greater than that on slow spindles. DIZ decreased the state anxiety of the subjects in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that measuring the amount and the frequency of fast spindles could be a useful tool in predicting the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "9": "Both anxiety-like behavior and the response to anxiolytic drugs vary according to the estrus cycle in the rat. Consequently, anxiety-like behavior and the sensitivity to anxiolytic drugs may be related to hormone level fluctuations occurring during the estrus cycle. In male rats tested in a conflict-operant paradigm, anxiolytic drugs increase immediate punished responding. However, it is unknown whether estrus phases impinge on the immediate punished responses in a conflict-operant paradigm. Therefore, in this study female rats were trained in a conflict-operant paradigm; after training all animals received vehicle or diazepam. Then the number of immediate punished reinforcers was evaluated during the estrus cycle. Results showed that vehicle-treated rats evaluated during late proestrus and estrus obtained a higher (p < 0.05) number of immediate punished reinforcers than rats evaluated during metestrus and diestrus. A low dose of diazepam (1.3 mg/kg; i.p) significantly increased (p < 0.05) the immediate punished responses only in late proestrus and estrus. The highest dose of diazepam tested (2.0 mg/kg; i.p.) significantly increased (p < 0.05) the immediate punished reinforcement in any estrus phase. These results suggest that a lower level of anxiety-like and an increased sensitivity to an anxiolytic drug occurred only in late proestrus and estrus in rats tested in a conflict-operant paradigm.", 
    "10": "The effects of two drugs with anxiolytic actions, diazepam (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg) and nicotine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) were examined on the time spent in social interaction by pairs of male gerbils. In a test arena lit by high light, diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) increased social interaction, without changing locomotor activity. Diazepam (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in locomotor activity, which reached significance at the higher dose. Nicotine produced a dose-related increase in social interaction, which reached significance at 0.5 mg/kg, but was without effect on locomotor activity. The specific increases in social interaction observed with diazepam and nicotine are similar to those seen in the well-validated social interaction test of anxiety in rats and suggest that social interaction in gerbils may also be used to screen for anxiolytic action of novel compounds.", 
    "11": "Seizures induced by an acute pentylenetetrazole (50 mg/kg) injection were accompanied by a long-term (at 1-48 h, but not on day 7) decrease in the density (B(max)) of [3H]-diazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors in rat cerebellar cortex with no change in affinity (K(d)). Kindling for 24 days by daily administrations of pentylenetetrazole (20 mg/kg) led to the same decrease in benzodiazepine receptor density (at 1-48 h, but not on day 7) as that observed after a single dose of pentylenetetrazole (50 mg/kg). This suggests a common mechanism for both acute and kindling-induced seizures, dependent on the long-term receptor changes. The increased susceptibility to seizures persisted for 6 months after the termination of kindling, with BDZ receptor density in cerebellar cortex reduced almost by half. In age-matched controls, an acute dose of PTZ (30 mg/kg) induced seizures and decrease in both B(max) and K(d) of [3H]-diazepam binding. In kindled rats, at 6 months post-kindling, the same dose of PTZ (30 mg/kg) restored the benzodiazepine receptor density to the level found 6 months before, at the time of termination of kindling. Also, the severity of seizures was enhanced in the kindled rats. The results are discussed in terms of a balance of inhibitory and excitatory processes, in which the reduced BDZ receptor density at 6 months post-kindling may represent a compensatory reaction to outbalance some alterations in excitatory systems that have been reported to be induced by kindling.", 
    "12": "As a first approach to study the effect of early visual deprivation in the GABA-ergic inhibitory system, the distribution of benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) was accurately estimated using [11C]flumazenil ([11C]FMZ). Measurements were carried out in five subjects who became blind early in life and in five sighted control subjects. The interactions between [11C]FMZ and BZR were described using a non-linear compartmental analysis which permitted to estimate the BZR synaptic density independently of other model parameters. The distribution of BZR in the visual areas and other cortical regions of blind subjects was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of controls. However, the BZR density in the cerebellum was significantly lower in blind than in control subjects (P<0.01). Our findings suggest that modifications of the cerebellar neural circuitry may be concomitant to the already observed compensatory reorganization in cerebral areas of blind subjects.", 
    "13": "Chronic stressors produce changes in hippocampal neurochemistry, neuronal morphology, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes. In rats, stress-induced changes in CA3 apical dendritic structure are mediated by corticosterone (CORT) acting, in part, on excitatory amino acid neurotransmission. CORT also alters GABA-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission, so the GABA(A) receptor system may also contribute to dendritic remodeling and other stress-related changes in hippocampal function. A previous study indicated that chronic CORT treatment produces complex changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA levels, so we hypothesized that CORT alters the pharmacological properties of hippocampal GABA(A) receptors. To test this, adult male rats were treated with CORT or vehicle pellets for 10 d, after which we quantified [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([(35)S]TBPS) and [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to GABA(A) receptors using in vitro receptor autoradiography. Pharmacological properties of receptors were assessed by examining the allosteric regulation of binding at both sites by GABA and 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha,21-diol-20-one (THDOC), an endogenous anxiolytic steroid. We found striking regional differences in the modulation of [(35)S]TBPS binding, particularly between strata radiatum and strata oriens, suggesting a functional heterogeneity among hippocampal GABA(A) receptors even within the apical versus basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we found that CORT treatment decreased the negative modulation of hippocampal [(35)S]TBPS binding by both GABA and THDOC and increased the enhancement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA and THDOC in the dentate gyrus. Together, these data suggest that prolonged exposure to stress levels of corticosteroids may alter hippocampal inhibitory tone by regulating the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors in discrete dendritic subfields.", 
    "14": "The number of clandestine drug laboratories in the United States and Europe has increased as a result of the rising popularity of methamphetamine, Ecstasy, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate among young people and drug abusers, and a shift from complex production procedures for these drugs to simpler \"cold cook\" methods involving household chemicals. Fires, explosions, corrosive chemicals, and toxic substances at clandestine drug laboratories have caused injuries and deaths among police officers, firefighters, and the public. Impurities in clandestine synthetic drugs have also caused injuries among people consuming the drugs. Information about these hazards should be communicated to public safety professionals and young people to reduce the number of injuries and deaths.", 
    "15": "A series of indazoloxypropanolamines 7 and 8, pindolol isosteres, were synthesized to extend the structure activity relationship (SAR) which was observed in an earlier series of related derivatives. Compounds 7, characterized by methyl substitution on the N-1 indazole nucleus, generally exhibited significant antiarrhythmic, local anaesthetic and analgesic activities. The preliminary radioligand binding assay highlighted, in compounds 7, an interesting beta 1-affinity which can be well correlated to their antiarrhyhtmic activity. Analogues 8 characterized by a phenyl group on the N-1 indazole nucleus, were generally less active as antiarrhyhtmic agents but generally interesting as local anaesthetics. Due to the importance of the indazole moiety as a carrier of antiphlogistic activity, the two classes of derivatives 7 and 8 were evaluated for their NSAID behaviour. Once again, compounds 7 resulted having more interesting analgesic and antipyretic effects than analogues 8.", 
    "16": "We present a 66-year-old patient with segmental myoclonus evoked by a brainstem infarction. The myoclonus appeared soon after a cerebrovascular accident and it was evident in the soft palate, jaw, neck, shoulders and upper limbs. Brain MRI showed infarction in the left pons and left cerebellum. Small amounts of orally administered clonazepam were remarkably effective. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) were normal. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) revealed delays in P 14 and N19 recorded at C3 by right median nerve stimulation. These findings were normalized in 4 days. Seg-mental myoclonus is thought to be evoked by olivary hypertrophy following cerebrovascular accident in the brainstem and is said to be resistant to medication. The limited involvement of the brainstem in our patient may account for the transient segmental myoclonus. The prognosis for this type of segmental myoclonus is excellent.", 
    "17": "Previous reports suggest that some atypical antipsychotics may have obsessogenic as well as antiobsessional effects. Given their higher affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors than dopamine D2 receptors, it has been speculated that atypical antipsychotics may induce obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, even at low doses, due to high 5HT2 antagonism, whereas improvement in OC symptoms is thought to occur only at high doses due to high D2 antagonism.", 
    "18": "In this open case series, the dose-response relationship of atypical antipsychotic augmentation in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and the dose-severity relationship in atypical anti psychotic-induced OC symptoms were examined. Three patients were identified who had either refractory OCD or OC symptoms following administration of atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone.", 
    "19": "Case 1: A linear dose-response relationship between increasing doses of olanzapine and improvement in OC symptoms was observed in an OCD patient resistant to 5-HT reuptake inhibitors. 2: OC symptoms induced by low doses of risperidone (1 mg) were reversed by increasing the doses of risperidone (3 mg) in a bipolar disorder patient suggesting an inverse dose-severity relationship. 3: No inverse dose-severity relationship was noted between olanzapine induced OC symptoms and its dosage in an asymptomatic OCD patient. Tretment-emergence OC symptoms responded to increasing the doses of maintanance clomipramine treatment.",

    "21": "In recent years, the use of benzodiazepines has been recognized as an independent risk factor for falls among the elderly. To evaluate the role of different types of benzodiazepines in determining falls in a hospitalized geriatric population, we conducted a prospective study among 7908 patients consecutively admitted in 58 clinical centers of the Gruppo Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell'Anziano (GIFA), during an 8-month observation period (1991 and 1993). Over 70% of the patients were older than 65 years, 50% were women, and 23. 6% had a benzodiazepine prescription during hospital stay. The number of patients who experienced one or more falls during follow-up was 174 (2.2%). Sixty falls occurred among patients taking benzodiazepines (3.2%) and 114 (1.9%) among those who did not use benzodiazepines; the crude odds ratio for users versus non-users was 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.3). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that benzodiazepines with very short (OR 1.9; CI 1.03-3.3) and short half-life (OR 1.8; CI 1.2-2.8) were positively associated with falls during hospital stay. Patients who used other psychotropic agents (OR 2.3; CI 1.7-3.4), antidiabetic agents (OR 1. 5; CI 1.03-2.2), patients with presence of cognitive impairment (OR 1.6; CI 1.08-2.3), high level of comorbidity (OR 1.7; CI 1.05-2.9), more advanced age (>80 years, OR 2.7; CI 1.5-4.7) and those who stayed in the hospital for 17 days or more (OR 2.1; CI 1.4-3.3) were also at a greater risk. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines with short and very short half-life are an important and independent risk factor for falls and their prescription to elderly hospitalized patients should be carefully evaluated.", 
    "22": "According to Gray [The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo-hippocampal System, Oxford University Press, New York, 1982], the hippocampus and the septum act in concert to control anxiety. We found that micro-infusion of midazolam into the dorsal hippocampus increased rats' open-arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze. Co-infusion of L-glutamate into the septum suppressed this anxiolytic effect. However, intra-hippocampal midazolam failed to alter rats' burying behavior in the shock-probe test. These findings suggest that the hippocampus and septum work together to regulate rats' behaviors in some (plus-maze) but not all (burying) animal tests of anxiety.", 
    "23": "Neurosteroids may play a major role in the regulation of various neurophysiological and behavioural processes. However, while the biochemical pathways involved in the synthesis of neuroactive steroids in the central nervous system are now elucidated, the mechanisms controlling the activity of neurosteroid-producing cells remain almost completely unknown. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), an endogenous ligand of benzodiazepine receptors, in the control of steroid biosynthesis in the frog hypothalamus. Glial cells containing ODN-like immunoreactivity were found to send their thick processes in the close vicinity of neurones expressing the steroidogenic enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Exposure of frog hypothalamic explants to graded concentrations of ODN (10(-10)-10(-5) M) produced a dose-dependent increase in the conversion of tritiated pregnenolone into various radioactive steroids, including 17-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The ODN-induced stimulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis was mimicked by the central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) inverse agonists methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). The stimulatory effects of ODN, beta-CCM and DMCM on steroid formation was markedly reduced by the CBR antagonist flumazenil. The ODN-evoked stimulation of neurosteroid production was also significantly attenuated by GABA. Collectively, these data indicate that the endozepine ODN, released by glial cell processes in the vicinity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-containing neurones, stimulates the biosynthesis of neurosteroids through activation of central-type benzodiazepines receptors.", 
    "24": "To compare the efficacy and complication profile of oral midazolam therapy and continuous-flow 50% nitrous oxide in alleviating anxiety during laceration repair in children 2 to 6 years old.", 
    "25": "We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial using 4 study groups who required laceration repair: (1) children who received standard care alone, which included comforting and topical anesthesia augmented with injected lidocaine if needed; (2) children who received standard care and oral midazolam; (3) children who received standard care and nitrous oxide; and (4) children who received standard care, oral midazolam, and nitrous oxide. Videotapes were blindly scored using the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) to assess distress during baseline, wound cleaning, lidocaine injecting, suturing, and recovery. Adverse effects were noted during suturing and by parent questionnaires completed 24 hours after suturing and at suture removal. OSBD-R data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Adverse effect data were analyzed using categorical models.", 
    "26": "Two hundred four subjects were enrolled (midazolam plus nitrous oxide 52, midazolam 51, nitrous oxide 51, standard care 50; mean patient age was 4.1 years; 66% were boys). Mean OSBD-R scores were lower for groups that received nitrous oxide during wound cleaning by 2.2 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.2), lidocaine injecting by 2.5 points (95% CI 1.4 to 3.5), and suturing by 2.9 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.9). Adverse effects occurred more frequently, and recovery times were longer for groups that received midazolam.",

    "28": "Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) have both been implicated in the transport of cholesterol across mitochondrial membranes in steroidogenic cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that StAR and PBR were associated in this process. To test this hypothesis, we measured fluorescence energy transfer (FET) between these proteins by fusing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP, donor fluorophore) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP, acceptor fluorophore) to the C-terminus of ovine StAR (37GFP) and ovine PBR (PBRYFP), respectively. These intrinsically fluorescent proteins were stably transfected into Cos-7 cells and determined to be biologically active. For FET to occur the appropriate fluorescent molecules need to be <100 A from each other. We observed 22.0 +/- 0.9% energy transfer efficiency for 37GFP and PBRYFP, a 4.9 fold increase above non-specific energy transfer between free GFP and PBRYFP (p <.0001). Thus, it appears that StAR and PBR are closely associated in mitochondrial membranes and that these molecules may interact in the transportation of cholesterol.", 
    "29": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive technique for mapping the working brain. Using a fingertapping task, imaging of subcortical regions has proven to be difficult. We studied an inpatient under treatment with olanzapine and haloperidol, focusing on subcortical brain activation. We compared this patient with normal controls and with patients using haloperidol or olanzapine. Brain activation was induced by a unilateral self-paced fingertapping task. Brainvoyager software package (version 3.7) was used for data analyzing. Significant increases in blood oxygen level-dependent response were found in the contralateral motor area and the ipsilateral cerebellum in all patients. Differences with regard to the subcortical regions could be revealed in both the examinations of the same patient and the different treatment groups. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is an important method to study the interaction between basal ganglia, thalamus and the motor cortex. It is especially helpful to investigate intra-individual differences under different treatment conditions.", 
    "30": "An ODS-2 column, a micellar mobile phase of high elution strength containing 0.1M sodium dodecyl sulfate and 3% (v/v) butanol, and ultraviolet detection at 230 nm are used for the determination of either of two benzodiazepines (clorazepate and diazepam) and a benzothiazepine (diltiazem) in pharmaceuticals. The procedure is shown to be competitive against conventional chromatography with methanol-water mobile phases, especially for diltiazem. The composition of the micellar mobile phase is selected using a predictive strategy based on an accurate retention model and assisted by computer simulation. Calibration graphs are linear at least in the 2.5 to 20 microg/mL, 4 to 20 microg/mL, and 5 to 40 microg/mL ranges for clorazepate, diazepam, and diltiazem, respectively. The intra- and interday repeatabilities (%) are clorazepate (1.7, 5.2), diazepam (0.43, 3.7), and diltiazem (0.36, 3.1). Limits of detection are well below the concentrations of the drugs found in the commercial pharmaceutical preparations analyzed. The drug contents evaluated with the proposed procedure are compared with the declared contents given by the manufacturers. The achieved percentages of label claim are usually between 95 and 104%.",

The preferential distribution is based on a counter current transfer, which takes place between nasal vein blood and brain arterial blood in the cavernous sinus-carotid artery complex. The present experiments attempt to document that drugs may also be transferred by this system. Groups of 10 large male rats were anaesthetised and intubated. Two catheters were inserted into the same carotid artery, one tip pointing towards the head, the other towards the heart. Parallel blood samples were obtained every 30 sec. for 10 min. after nasal administration of radioactively labelled diazepam or cocaine, and the plasma radioactivity measured. Control groups received the drugs intravenously. The uptake of diazepam was rapid, while cocaine uptake was slow. The average ratio between the radioactivity of parallel samples (R: \"Head\" plasma/\"Heart\" plasma) in rats treated with nasal diazepam was 1.12+/-0.04, 181 (average+/-S.E.M., n) for the whole 10 min. period and 1.20+/-0.05, 96 for the second half of the sampling period. The increase of 12 and 20% is highly significant. The intravenous ratio for diazepam and both R's for the cocaine groups were not significantly different from 1.00. The present experiments show that nasal administration of diazepam induces a relatively higher concentration in the brain arterial blood than in parallel samples obtained from another artery. A preferential, first-pass distribution to the brain after nasal administration of diazepam may thus exist.", 
    "46": "Atypical neuroleptics have enriched our treatment programmes, especially in childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. This article reviews the use of atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents with schizophrenic disorder. It considers the receptor binding profile and pharmacological properties, indications, side effects, clinical applications and trials of atypical neuroleptics in comparison to the classical neuroleptic haloperidol in adolescent schizophrenia. Special emphasis is placed on the most common atypical neuroleptics clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone since most studies are carried out with these compounds, especially with clozapine. More clinically controlled trials have to be conducted since only one was performed so far. The place of the atypical neuroleptics is discussed and further studies are necessary in order to differentiate the indications tested so far and to find out if the spectrum of indications can be broadened.",

This technique might be a satisfactory alternative to general anaesthesia for implant surgery in anxious patients or when procedures exceed 60-min duration.", 
    "48": "20 patients were treated on 23 occasions. A 2-mg bolus of midazolam was injected intravenously followed after 90 s by 1 mg increments until the patient was adequately sedated. 30 min after this induction with midazolam, a propofol infusion was started at a rate which varied between 0-300 mg/h (0-30 ml/h). The actual infusion rate was adjusted in order to maintain the optimum sedation level which had been achieved using midazolam. The quality of sedation was assessed using Ellis and Sedation scores.",

Initial sedation was achieved using midazolam, this was then maintained using a variable propofol infusion. The shorter distribution and elimination half-lifes of the latter drug made matching the level of sedation to the patient's needs easier and also provided good short-term recovery.",

The effects of the GABA-A agonist muscimol, the GABA-B agonist baclofen, the barbiturate GABA-A receptor modulator pentobarbital, and the benzodiazepine GABA-A modulators triazolam and imidazenil were examined alone and as pretreatments to cocaine. For comparison, the effects of pentobarbital pretreatment on the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects of amphetamine were also examined.", 
    "54": "When administered alone, the GABA agonists and GABA-A receptor modulators produced primarily saline-appropriate responding. When administered as pretreatments to cocaine, pentobarbital attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine in all monkeys tested, and the high efficacy benzodiazepine agonist triazolam attenuated cocaine's effects in three of five monkeys. Muscimol, baclofen and the low efficacy benzodiazepine agonist imidazenil did not alter cocaine's discriminative stimulus effects. Although pentobarbital blocked the effects of the monoamine reuptake blocker cocaine, it did not alter the cocaine-like effects of the monoamine releaser amphetamine.", 
    "55": "These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GABA-A receptor modulators attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine in rhesus monkeys by decreasing the activity of dopaminergic systems.

However, it is unclear whether benzodiazepine affects the PER: gene expression accompanying a behavioural phase shift. Brotizolam (0.5 - 10 mg kg(-1)) induced large phase advances in hamster rhythm when injected during mid-subjective daytime (circadian time 6 or 9), but not at circadian time 0, 3 or 15. Brotizolam (5 mg kg(-1)) significantly reduced the expression of PER:1 and PER:2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus 1 and 2 h after injection at circadian time 6, and slightly reduced them at circadian time 20. Injection of 8-OH-DPAT (5 mg kg(-1)) at subjective daytime induced similar phase advances with a reduction of PER:1 and PER:2 expression. Co-administration of brotizolam with 8-OH DPAT failed to potentiate the 8-OH DPAT-induced phase advances and reduced PER: expression. Both phase advance and rapid induction of PER:1 and PER:2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus after light exposure (5 lux, 15 min) at circadian time 20 was strongly attenuated by co-treatment with brotizolam 5 mg kg(-1). The present results strongly suggest that reduction of PER:1 and/or PER:2 expression during subjective daytime by brotizolam may be an important step in causing a behavioural phase advance. The co-administration experiment suggests that common mechanism(s) are involved in brotizolam- or 8-OH DPAT-induced phase advances and the reduction of PER: gene expression. These results suggest that brotizolam is not only a good drug for insomnia but also a drug capable of facilitating re-entrainment like melatonin.", 
    "71": "SB 209670 is a potent antagonist of the vasoconstrictor (ET(A)- and ET(B)-receptor-mediated) and vasodilator (ET(B)-receptor-mediated) effects of endothelin, whereas SB 234551 is relatively selective for the constrictor (ET(A)-receptor-mediated) effects. Since we had previously found SB 209670 exerted antihypertensive, vasodilator effects in conscious, heterozygous, transgenic ((mRen-2)27) (abbreviated to TG) rats, here we compared the two antagonists in that model, and assessed their chronic effects on responses to exogenous endothelin-1. We did this to test our global hypothesis, namely, that SB 209670, but not SB 234551, would cause inhibition of the depressor effects of exogenous endothelin-1 in vivo, and that this differential effect would be associated with a more marked antihypertensive action of SB 234551 in TG rats. SB 209670 and SB 234551 (infused for 50 h) exerted similar, sustained, antihypertensive effects in TG rats. The antihypertensive effects of the antagonists occurred at times when the pressor effects of exogenous endothelin-1 were not significantly inhibited. Furthermore, SB 234551 did not exert a greater antihypertensive effect than SB 209670 at a time (i.e., 2 - 4 h) when the depressor effects of endothelin-1 were abolished by the latter, but not by the former (although this differential action was lost after 24 h infusion). The results caused us to reject the hypothesis that selective antagonism of the vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin-1 would result in SB 234551 exerting a greater antihypertensive effect than SB 209670 in TG rats.", 
    "72": "Hepatic encephalopathy arises from the combination of hepatocellular dysfunction and portal-systemic shunting. Encephalopathy is more prominent in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis and signals the presence of fulminant hepatic failure in patients with acute liver injury. As important as the extent of shunting is the presence of large spontaneous collaterals. Ammonia continues to be a leading toxin influencing brain function. Endogenous benzodiazepines and cytokines may contribute to one of ammonia's key effects in the brain: astrocyte swelling. The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion; the search for a precipitating factor should be started immediately in all cases of encephalopathy. The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy has three aims: decrease the nitrogenous load from the gut, improve the extra-intestinal elimination of ammonia and counteract central abnormalities of neurotransmission. The mainstay of treatment is directed at the colon. Newer approaches targeting the brain, such as flumazenil, have become available.", 
    "73": "Ganaxolone is a member of a novel class of neuroactive steroids which modulates the GABA(A) receptor complex (GRC) via an unique recognition site, distinct from those of benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Preclinical data from an array of chemically- and electrically-induced seizure models demonstrate that ganaxolone possesses broad spectrum anticonvulsant activity with potential clinical utility in both generalised and partial seizures, as well as cocaine-induced seizures. Clinical data to date support a favourable safety profile with somnolence, an extension of GABAergic activity, being the most frequently reported adverse event at higher doses. Target indications include infantile spasms and complex partial seizures. Open-label data in paediatric patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that ganaxolone may be effective in treating infantile spasms. A controlled trial utilising an in-patient, monotherapy design demonstrated that ganaxolone effectively decreases complex partial seizure activity compared to placebo. An important area of further evaluation is ganaxolone's potential role in the treatment of women with catamenial epilepsy.",

    "80": "The influence of conventional antiepileptic drugs (valproate, phenobarbital, diazepam, clonazepam, carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin) on rat platelet activation induced by arachidonic acid (AA) or adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP) was investigated both ex vivo and in vitro on platelet-rich plasma (PRP). It was found that only diazepam, and to a smaller extent clonazepam, impaired rat platelet function. These benzodiazepines did not affect ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by ADP but dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation and malondialdehyde (MDA) synthesis were observed, when the platelets were stimulated with AA (ED(50) of diazepam for aggregation was 2.7 mg/kg and that for MDA synthesis - 3.9 mg/kg). In in vitro study, diazepam was found to be a potent inhibitor of AA-induced platelet aggregation (IC(50) 1.2 microg/ml) and MDA synthesis (IC(50) 4.0 microg/ml). Higher concentrations of diazepam were required to inhibit ADP-induced aggregation (IC(50) 29.0 microg/ml). Clonazepam also exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on AA-induced platelet aggregation and MDA synthesis but this effect was weaker when compared to diazepam. The present data demonstrate that diazepam possesed a strong inhibitory effect on rat platelet activation. The correlation between the reduction of platelet aggregation and the synthesis of MDA may suggest that the observed effect of diazepam is due to the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway of the AA metabolism in platelet.",

The number of deaths attributed to the intravenous use of heroin has increased dramatically in Victoria since 1990. The increases were 5-fold. There were 166 deaths in 1997 and 268 in 1998. The heroin death is typified by a median age of 30 for males and 29 for females, although the age range is from children as young as 15 to adults in their sixth decade of life. Over 85% of cases were using other central nervous system depressants, with benzodiazepines (45%) and alcohol (36%) being the most common. Approximately 60% occurred indoors at a private residence, the remainder occurred in public places and other locations. A similar number (60%) died alone. A wide distribution of deaths occurred throughout the metropolitan and regional areas showing a growing spread in the heroin problem in the community.", 
    "82": "In recent studies, we showed that flunitrazepam (FNTZ) and other benzodiazepines interact with artificial phospholipid membranes locating at the polar head group region, inducing a membrane expansion, reducing the molecular packing and reorganising molecular dipoles. In the present paper we investigated the possibility that those phenomena could be transduced into changes in the curvature of membranes from natural origin. Hence we studied the effect of FNTZ on cellular morphology using human erythrocyte as a natural assay system. Shape changes of erythrocytes were evaluated by light microscopy and expressed as a morphological index (MI). FNTZ induced echinocytosis in a time-dependent manner with MI values significantly higher than those of control (without drug) or DMSO (vehicle) samples. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic known to induce stomatocytosis by incorporating in the inner monolayer, counterbalanced the concentration-dependent FNTZ crenating effects. FNTZ induced protective effects, compared with control and DMSO, against time-dependent hemolysis. Hypotonic-induced hemolysis, was also lowered by FNTZ in a concentration-dependent manner. Both antihemolytic effects suggested a drug-induced membrane expansion allowing a greater increase in cell volume before lysis. In such a complex system like a cell, curvature changes triggered by drug partitioning towards the plasma membrane, might be an indirect effect exerted through modifications of ionic-gradients or by affecting cytoskeleton-membrane linkage. In spite of that, the curvature changes can be interpreted as a mechanism suitable to relieve the tension generated initially by drug incorporation into the bilayer and may be the resultant of the dynamic interactions of many molecular fluxes leading to satisfy the spontaneous membrane curvature.",

Effects were assessed on punished and non-suppressed water consumption using a lick suppression (Vogel) paradigm. Alprazolam had no effect on non-suppressed licking, [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding or receptor subunit transcript levels, compared to non-drug controls. When each fifth lick produced a shock (0-0.5 mA), responding was suppressed in an intensity-related manner. The highest intensity significantly decreased licking (85%), [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding (12%) and alpha1 transcript levels (63%) in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (15%), compared to non-punished controls. Punishment increased the ratio of gamma2L/S transcripts in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. Alprazolam blocked or reversed each of these effects. These results show that punishment has similar effects on BZ binding and GABA(A) receptor subunit expression and that alprazolam can block or reverse those effects. Such changes may be related to the anxiolytic effects of alprazolam.",

Diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and MPFC synergistically increased open arm exploration on a second (repeated) plus-maze trial. These results suggest that the MPFC would be implicated in a generalized mechanism of warning enabling emission of appropriate responses to anxiogenic stimuli.

Therefore, the identification of the area of irreversible damage, and its distinction from the penumbral zone, may improve the estimation of the potential efficacy of various therapeutic strategies. Ten patients (seven male, three female, aged 52-75 years) with acute ischaemic stroke, in whom MRI delineated an infarct involving the cortex 3 weeks after the attack, were studied by [(11)C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET to assess their neuronal integrity, and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by H(2)(15)O PET 2-12 h (median interval 6 h) after onset of symptoms. Cortical volumes of interest (3 mm radius) were placed on co-registered CBF, FMZ and on late MRI scans. Using initial CBF and FMZ binding data from volumes of interest finally located within or outside the cortical infarct, cumulative probability curves were computed to predict eventual infarction or non-infarction. Positive (at least 95% chance of infarct) and negative (at least 95% chance of non-infarct) prediction limits for CBF (4.8 and 14.1 ml/100 g/min, respectively) and for FMZ binding (3.4 and 5.5 times the mean of normal white matter, respectively) were determined to define the penumbral range. Using the lower FMZ binding threshold of 3.4 for irreversible tissue damage and the upper CBF value of 14.1 ml/ 100 g/min for the threshold of critical perfusion at or above which tissue will likely be preserved, various cortical subcompartments were identified: of the final cortical infarct (median size 25.7 cm(3)) a major portion comprising, on average, 55.1% showed FMZ binding critically decreased, thus predicting necrosis. In 20.5% of the final infarct, on average, CBF was in the penumbral range (<14.1 ml/100 g/min) and FMZ binding was above the critical threshold of irreversible damage. Only 12.9% of the final infarct exhibited neuronal integrity and CBF values above the penumbral range. Therefore, most of the final infarct is irreversibly damaged already at the time of the initial evaluation, when studied several hours after stroke onset. A much smaller portion is still viable but suffers from insufficient blood supply: this tissue may be salvaged by effective reperfusion. Only an even smaller compartment is viable and sufficiently perfused, but eventually becomes necrotic, mainly owing to delayed mechanisms, and may benefit from neuroprotective or other measures targeted at secondary damage. Therefore, early reperfusion is crucial in acute ischaemic stroke.", 
    "103": "Our purpose for this prospective, randomized, and double-blinded study was to evaluate the anesthetic efficacy of S(+)-ketamine, an enantiomer of racemic ketamine, compared with a combination of S(+)-ketamine and midazolam, and plain midazolam for rectal premedication in pediatric anesthesia. Sixty-two children, ASA physical status I and II, scheduled for minor surgery, were randomly assigned to be given rectally one of the following: 1.5 mg/kg preservative-free S(+)-ketamine, a combination of 0.75 mg/kg preservative-free S(+)-ketamine and 0.75 mg/kg midazolam, or 0.75 mg/kg midazolam. Preoperative anesthetic efficacy was graded during a period of 20 min by using a five-point scale from 1 = awake to 5 = asleep. Tolerance during anesthesia induction via face mask was graded by using a four-point scale from 1 = very good to 4 = bad. A sufficient anesthetic level (> or = 3) after rectal premedication was reached in 86% in midazolam/S(+)-ketamine premedicated children, in 75% in midazolam premedicated children, but only in 30% in S(+)-ketamine premedicated children (P < 0.05 S(+)-ketamine versus midazolam/S(+)-ketamine and midazolam groups). The incidence of side effects after rectal premedication was rare. Whereas the mask acceptance score was comparable in the three study groups, a 25% rate of complications during anesthesia induction via face was observed in the S(+)-ketamine study group (P < 0.05 versus other study groups). Our conclusions are that S(+)-ketamine for rectal premedication in the dose we chose shows a poor anesthetic effect and a frequent incidence of side effects during induction of anesthesia via face mask compared with the combination of midazolam/S(+)-ketamine and plain midazolam. Dose-response studies of S(+)-ketamine for rectal premedication in pediatric anesthesia may be warranted.", 
    "104": "We compared the effects of oral clonidine (4 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) on the preanesthetic sedation and postoperative recovery profile in children during tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. In a double-blinded, double-dummy study design, 134 ASA physical status I-II children aged 4-12 yr were randomized to receive a combination of either clonidine and placebo (Group A), or placebo and midazolam (Group B) at 60-90 min and 30 min, respectively, before the induction of anesthesia. Children in the clonidine group exhibited more intense anxiety on separation and during induction of anesthesia via a mask as measured by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scores. They also had significantly lower mean intraoperative arterial blood pressures, shorter surgery, anesthesia, and emergence times, and a decreased need for supplemental oxygen during recovery compared with the midazolam group. However, the clonidine group had larger postoperative opioid requirements, maximum excitement and pain scores based on the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario scale in the Phase 1 postanesthetic care unit. There were no differences between the two groups in the times to discharge readiness, postoperative emesis, unanticipated hospital admission rates, postdischarge maximum pain scores, and 24 h analgesic requirements. The percentage of parents who were completely satisfied with the child's preoperative experience was significantly higher in the midazolam group. There were no differences in parental satisfaction with the recovery period. We conclude that under the conditions of this study, oral midazolam is superior to oral clonidine as a preanesthetic medication in this patient population.",

Midazolam was superior to clonidine as oral preanesthetic medication for these patients.", 
    "106": "Submucosal glands were isolated within 4 h of death from tracheae and bronchi obtained from autopsied lungs, and the secretory response of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was examined with ELISA and a secretory index. Although human neutrophil elastase (HNE) at low concentrations increased SLPI secretion above the control level (i.e., 149% of control level at 10(-11) M), HNE at high concentrations significantly decreased it below the control level (i.e., 16% of control level at 10(-7) M). The decrease in SLPI concentration was shown to result from the degradation of SLPI by excessive HNE. Methacholine induced significant secretion (i.e., 363% of control level at 10(-5) M) that was abolished by both M(1) and M(3) receptor antagonists. A semiquantitative analysis of SLPI mRNA by RT-PCR and Southern blot showed that compared with the superficial epithelium, submucosal glands had a 30-fold or higher level of SLPI mRNA. Both HNE and methacholine significantly increased the level of SLPI mRNA in submucosal glands in a dose-dependent manner (i.e., 357% of control level at 10(-7) M and 175% of control level at 10(-5) M, respectively). These findings indicate that human airway submucosal glands can transcribe 30-fold or more SLPI mRNA than the superficial epithelium and that SLPI mRNA transcription and secretion are regulated by both HNE and muscarinic receptors.",

Seven days later, the dogs received an identical dose of i.v. flumazenil, and serum samples were again collected, as above. Comparative quantitation of flumazenil levels (i.v. vs. SM) was made using a sensitive HPLC assay (UV detection). Direct/local drug toxicity was visually scored by unbiased raters of color photographs (test and control mucosa) taken at 1, 2, and 7 days following SM flumazenil injection.

Thus, serum drug levels following SM drug administration were broadly comparable to those obtained during the elimination phase of corresponding i.v. drug delivery. Regarding drug tissue toxicity, no evidence of direct drug toxicity was observed by unbiased raters of color photographs (test and control mucosa) taken at 1, 2, and 7 days following SM flumazenil injection.

Medical treatment is only considered in severe cases with persistent and extended symptoms where there is a high risk of self-injury. We report the case of a 12-year-old boy with severe night terrors and somnambulism whose symptoms completely remitted under medication with the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor paroxetine. Its impact on sleep remains unclear as we were not able to show any significant changes in the polysomnographic sleep macroarchitecture. Paroxetine might be an alternative to benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants because it permits subchronic medication, necessitates little dose titration and is well tolerated, with few side-effects, and, in particular, has low sedating properties.", 
    "117": "Different classes of Peripheral-type Benzodiazepine Receptor (PBR) ligands were examined and common structural elements were detected and used to develop a rational binding model based on energetically allowed ligand conformations. Two lipophilic regions and one electrostatic interaction site are essential features for high affinity ligand binding, while a further lipophilic region plays an important modulator role. A comparative molecular field analysis, performed over 130 PBR ligands by means of the GRID/GOLPE methodology, led to a PLS model with both high fitting and predictive values (r2 = 0.898, Q2 = 0.761). The outcome from the 3D QSAR model and the GRID interaction fields computed on the putative endogenous PBR ligands DBI (Diazepam Binding Inhibitor) and TTN (Tetracontatetraneuropeptide) was used to identify the amino acids most probably involved in PBR binding. Three amino acids, bearing lipophilic side chains, were detected in DBI (Phe49, Leu47 and Met46) and in TTN (Phe33, Leu31 and Met30) as likely residues underlying receptor binding. Moreover, a qualitative comparison of the molecular electrostatic potentials of DBI, TTN and selected synthetic ligands indicated also similar electronic properties. Convergent results from the modeling studies of synthetic and endogenous ligands suggest a common binding mode to PBRs. This may help the rational design of new high affinity PBR ligands.",

Races were run at a treadmill speed that caused horses to exercise at 120% of their maximal oxygen consumption. Horses ran until fatigued or for a maximum of 2 minutes. Two minutes after exercise, horses received a combination of xylazine hydrochloride (2.2 mg/kg of body weight) and acepromazine maleate (0.04 mg/kg) IV. Five minutes after exercise, horses received 1 of the following 4 IV anesthetic regimens: ketamine hydrochloride (2.2 mg/kg); ketamine (2.2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.1 mg/kg); tiletamine hydrochloride-zolazepam hydrochloride (1 mg/kg); and guaifenesin (50 mg/kg) and thiopental sodium (5 mg/kg). Treatments were randomized. Cardiopulmonary indices were measured, and samples of blood were collected before and at specific times for 90 minutes after each race.",

As patients are usually elderly, a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants. New antidepressants such as the SSRIs and the reversible MAO inhibitors should be the first-line agents in these patients, because their efficacy is not different from that of classic TCA, but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects, ease of use and safety. Improvement in cognitive performance, however, may not be expected from the new antidepressants. For the treatment of agitation, aggression and irritability, antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use, although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patients. Good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram. All medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples, so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously.",

Therapy should be directed towards rapid termination of the SE, prevention of seizure recurrence and treatment of any underlying cause. A review of drugs commonly used in the treatment of SE is presented. The morbidity and mortality of SE is significant and directly dependant upon prompt and appropriate medical therapy.

Sixteen adult patients undergoing CABG were studied with patients in group M and P (n = 8 each) given intravenous midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 and propofol 4 mg.kg-1.h-1 with fentanyl 25 micrograms.kg-1 until sternotomy, respectively. Following induction of anaesthesia, cardiac index and heart rate decreased significantly (30% and 20% in both groups, p < 0.05) these variables returned to baseline on completion of sternotomy. In addition, in group P mean arterial pressure decreased significantly (about 15%) following induction and there were no ischaemic signs. Overall for MAP there was no significant difference between the two groups. LVSWI and RVSWI were reduced by around 25% in both groups. Only the change in LVSWI reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). This reduction may have exert a caridioprotectant action by decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption. We conclude that both TIVA techniques represent an acceptable anaesthetic regimen for use in cardiac anaesthesia.", 
    "127": "The interaction of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, with the protective activity of conventional antiepileptics against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures was tested in mice. Alone, 7-nitroindazole (up to 50mg/kg) was ineffective in this model of experimental epilepsy. However, it potentiated the anticonvulsive activity of ethosuximide and clonazepam, significantly reducing their ED50S against PTZ-induced convulsions (from 144 to 76 mg/kg, and from 0.05 to 0.016 mg/kg, respectively). Conversely, the protective actions of valproate and phenobarbital were not affected by the NOS inhibitor. Since the nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, did not reverse the action of 7-NI on ethosuximide or clonazepam, an involvement of central NO does not seem probable. Neither ethosuximide nor clonazepam, administered at their ED50S (144 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively), produced significant adverse effects as regards motor coordination (chimney test) and long-term memory (passive avoidance task). Also 7-NI (50 mg/kg) and its combinations with ethosuximide and clonazepam (providing a 50% protection against PTZ-evoked seizures) did not disturb motor and mnemonic performance in mice. The interaction at the pharmacokinetic level does not seem probable, at least in the case of ethosuximide, because the NOS inhibitor did not interfere with its plasma or brain concentrations.", 
    "128": "Small platform stress was induced in male BALB/c mice by placing them on small platforms (d = 3.5 cm) surrounded by water for 24 or 72 h. This experimental model contains several factors of stress, like rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation, isolation, immobilization and falling into the water. After 24 h small platform stress exposure latency to sleep was measured after the administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam (1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.). As could be expected, diazepam significantly shortened the latency to sleep. Surprisingly the administration of Ro 15-4513 also shortened the latency to sleep. In addition [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was measured in the cerebellum of control and small platform stressed mice. Small platform stress for 24 h did not alter the maximal number of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites (Bmax) and decreased their affinity (K(D)). Small platform stress for 72 h significantly increased the number of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites and decreased their affinity. These effects were due to changes in diazepam-sensitive binding. In conclusion, it could be supposed that exposure of mice to small platform stress causes changes in the function of the [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites, probably a shift of binding sites toward agonist conformation, that leads to changes in the effects of Ro 15-4513.",

The microextraction device consisted of a porous hollow fiber of polypropylene attached to two guiding needles inserted through a septum and a 4 ml vial. The hollow fiber filled with extraction solvent was immersed in sample solution. The extraction device was continuously vibrated at 600 rpm for 50 min. An aliquot (1 microl) of the extraction solvent with preconcentrated analytes was injected directly into the capillary gas chromatograph. Thirty samples were extracted simultaneously on the vibrator, providing a high sample capacity.

The cyclocondensation of the resulting Schiffs base in benzene containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) gave 3-cyano-8-nitro-4-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine in 49% yield. The same reaction of isoxazole carbaldeyde with 1,2-diamino-4-methoxy- and 4-chlorobenzenes afforded the corresponding Schiffs bases.

    "131": "The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of patient history in the identification of the drugs taken by patients who have an acute drug overdose. To this end, a prospective study involving 51 cases of acute, deliberate drug poisoning was carried out (patients with ethanol as the only apparent cause of intoxication were excluded). Information based on interviews with the patients and their companions or on circumstantial evidence (e.g., drug containers found) was compared with the results from drug analyses of various body fluids. The information obtained on admission was completely in accordance with the laboratory findings in only 27% of the cases. Minor discrepancies between the history and the results from drug analyses concerning the identity of the drugs taken were found in 55% of the cases. In 18% of the cases, the discrepancies were considered clinically important. Serious symptoms occurred in approximately 20% of the patients, but none of them were the result of incorrect information obtained on admission. All the patients survived. These results support the prevailing view that rapid identification of the drugs taken in overdose by means of comprehensive drug screens would have little effect on the treatment of most cases of acute poisoning. However, such assays would enable optimal treatment of many cases of acute poisoning by reducing the need for supervision and costly treatments and facilitating the identification of cases that would require prompt drug-specific treatment.", 
    "132": "This study aimed to characterize the relationships between administered dosages of psychotropic drugs, plasma drug concentration, and prolactin levels in a group of elderly nursing home residents. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design study, blood samples were drawn from 47 nursing home residents at least 6 hours after taking either haloperidol, thioridazine, or lorazepam. Correlations between drug dosage and plasma drug levels were significant for haloperidol and thioridazine, but not for lorazepam. Plasma drug levels were below the levels of detection for most of those taking haloperidol. Lorazepam was detected in the blood of 4 of the participants even after 3 weeks of downward titration to placebo and 6 weeks of placebo. Prolactin level was related to administered dosage only in those who were taking haloperidol. For those taking haloperidol or thioridazine, prolactin levels decreased when participants were on placebo. When an older person is taken off lorazepam, the possibility of residual drug in their bodies even 6 weeks after termination of drug use should be considered. Haloperidol may be clinically active in the brain despite no currently detectable plasma drug concentration.",

The selectivity of the assay was optimized by variation of stationary phase, temperature, as well as ionic strength, composition and pH of the mobile phase and the dependence of the detector response on the applied potential was investigated. The best results with respect to resolution at moderate retention times were obtained with a mixture of 0.02 mol/l phosphate buffer (pH 6) and acetonitrile in a volume ratio of 55:45 (v/v) on a LiChrospher-100 RP-8ec column (150x4.6 mm I.D.). Considerable improvement of selectivity was achieved if the column temperature was kept constant at 12 degrees C. Two detection modes were applied, UV detection at 250 nm, inserted upstream to the electrochemical detector, and reductive electrochemical detection at the hanging mercury drop electrode at -1.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which proved to be especially sensitive in case of nitrophenyl-containing benzodiazepine species. The elaborated assay showed to be linear up to at least 2 mg/l for each compound. Detection limits generally were in the range of 6.5-123 ng/ml (130 pg-2.46 ng on-column, using a 20-microl loop) with relative standard deviations between 1.1 and 8.6% depending on the actual benzodiazepine investigated.",

From the results reported in this paper and other unpublished results, it appears clear that the calibration procedure based on fuzzy regression is the most suitable regression method in quantitative TLC.", 
    "135": "Pig liver is a possible source of hepatocytes for extracorporeal bio-artificial liver devices. In order to evaluate recovered hepatocyte function following enzymatic isolation, we developed a cytochemical method that is based on the capacity of hepatocytes to sequester the anthracycline antitumour drug doxorubicin within intracellular acidic compartments. Doxorubicin is a naturally fluorescent molecule. Thus, the process of drug concentration within hepatocytes can be visualized in living conditions by fluorescence microscopy. Porcine hepatocytes harvested from heart-beating donors were grown either as isolated cell suspensions or as tissue monolayers. Immediately after isolation and at fixed culture times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mM doxorubicin in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 10 min at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Parallel electron microscopy was performed to compare fluorescence data with general cell morphology. To monitor lysosomal acidification capacity, the fluorescent pH-sensitive vital dye LysoSensor-Blue was used. Doxorubicin fluorescence showed different patterns of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, according to the time allowed for cell recovery and the culture method. In particular, cytoplasmic fluorescence changed from a diffuse staining, that could be observed after cell isolation and in hepatocyte suspensions, to a punctate perinuclear and pericanalicular fluorescence detectable in fully recovered hepatocyte monolayers. This study indicates that the 'doxorubicin-fluorescence test' may be considered a simple and rapid procedure for assessing hepatocyte functional condition. It may provide valuable and 'real time' guidelines for judging the correct way these cells are to be collected, preserved and utilized for clinical purposes.", 
    "136": "Impulsive behavior may represent, in part, a failure of behavioral inhibition (the ability to delay or inhibit a response). In this study, use of a multiple signaled-unsignaled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rates (DRL) 15-s schedule allowed examination of drug effects in conditions in which level of stimulus control differed. Results showed that whereas diazepam increased premature responding during signaled and unsignaled DRL components, amphetamine and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol increased premature responding primarily during unsignaled components when timing was necessary for efficient performance on the task. In contrast, pimozide and desipramine increased long-delay responses across both components, resulting in longer mean interresponse times. Collectively, these results suggest that the use of different levels of stimulus control may aid in separation of drug effects on timing and other behavioral processes, including behavioral inhibition.",

    "156": "Fifteen consecutive ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients with different diseases and three regimens of analgo-sedation were included: group 1: no analgo-sedation, group 2: ketamine and benzodiazepines, and group 3: fentanyl and benzodiazepines. Six healthy volunteers were studied as controls. Twenty-four hour esophageal anterograde (propulsive) and retrograde motility changes were assessed by a manometry system.", 
    "157": "The frequencies of contractions were 0.67 +/- 0.1/min (no analgo-sedation) 0.093 +/- 0.02 (ketamine) and 0.076 +/- 0.01 (fentanyl) (p < 0.05 as compared to controls). The amplitudes (% of maximum) were 98 % (control), 58 % (analgo-sedation), 38 % (ketamine) and 42 % (fentanyl; p < 0.05 for the comparison of fentanyl and ketamine with controls). Whereas the percentage of propulsive contractions was significantly decreased in patients (no sedation: 45 %, ketamine: 34 %; fentanyl: 35 %, p < 0.05) as compared to controls (72 %), the percentage of retrograde contractions increased: no sedation: 29 %, ketamine: 34 % and fentanyl: 37 % as compared to controls: 10 %, p < 0.05. Analysis according to the underlying diseases showed marked inhibition of motility parameters within any disease group in comparison with controls.", 
    "158": "Irrespective of the underlying disease, propulsive motility of the esophageal body is significantly reduced during any kind of sedation in critically ill patients. Possibly central as well peripheral drug-related effects are involved in such a depression. Twenty-four hour motility recordings appear to be a valuable and feasible method to quantify and analyze esophageal motor disorders in critically ill patients.", 
    "159": "To study the need for analgesia and sedation before colonoscopy.", 
    "160": "Fifty consecutive outpatients were randomly assigned to receive meperidine (0.7 mg/kg) or midazolam (0-035 mg/kg) intravenously (n = 25) or to receive no medication (n = 25) before colonoscopy. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) and heart rate were monitored. Mean blood pressure (MBP) was recorded before and after endoscopy. Patients in the group receiving no medication who experienced marked abdominal pain received sedation and analgesia similar to the premedicated group. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the patients evaluated the degree of abdominal pain experienced during colonoscopy on a scale from 0 to 9.", 
    "161": "Complete colonoscopy was performed in 92% of the patients. No significant changes in heart rate were registered in either group. However, in the premedicated group mean blood pressure fell significantly (97.6 +/- 2.6 vs. 89.5 +/- 2.7 mmHg) before and after colonoscopy, respectively (p < 0.05). Nine patients experienced clinically relevant oxygen desaturation (SaO2 > 90%). Of these, five were from the premedicated group and four were from the group receiving no medication. In two patients, both from the premedicated group, the decrease in SaO2 was severe (SaO2 < 85%). The degree of abdominal pain was similar in both groups: 3.64_0.47 (premedicated) vs. 3.92 +/- 0.5 (non-medicated). In the non-medicated group, two patients required analgesia and sedation to complete the colonoscopy and 20 (80%) preferred not to receive sedation in future colonoscopies.",

    "163": "Caffeine (Caf) counteracts various effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs). Since the effects of zolpidem, a short-acting atypical GABA(A)-BZD agonist, were not antagonized by Caf, we studied an interaction between Caf and midazolam (Mid) in healthy volunteers.", 
    "164": "In Study 1, 108 healthy students divided to 6 parallel groups were given Mid 12 mg (capsule) and Caf 125 and 250 mg (in decaffeinated coffee), alone and in combinations in the double-blind placebo-controlled manner. Objective and subjective tests were done before and at 45 and 90 min after intake. Ranked delta-values (changes from baseline) were analyzed by one-way contrast ANOVA and Scheffe's tests. In Study 2, six healthy subjects took Mid 15 mg (tablet) with and without Caf 300 mg. The dynamic effects were analyzed as in Study 1 and the plasma concentrations were assayed.", 
    "165": "In Study 1, learn effects after placebo (ad + 15%) were seen for letter cancellation and digit symbol substitution tests. Midazolam alone significantly (p < 0.05 vs. delta-placebo) reduced letter cancellation and digit symbol substitution, lowered flicker fusion, impaired digit learning and caused subjective calmness on VAS. Caffeine alone did not differ from placebo objectively, yet improved quick-wittedness and contentedness on VAS. In the combinations, Mid + Caf 125 mg differed from placebo objectively as Mid alone, whereas Mid + Caf 250 mg did not. Mid + Caf 250 mg differed from Mid on digit substitution, but did not differ from Mid+Caf 150 mg in impairing memory and causing subjective sedation. In Study 2, Mid 15 mg caused sedation and Caf 300 mg increased plasma Mid at 45 min. Mid + Caf did not differ from Mid alone objectively, but did so subjectively on VAS (p > 0.05).", 
    "166": "In conclusion, in a parallel group study, sedative effects of Mid 12 mg were only moderately antagonized by Caf 250 mg but not by Caf 125 mg. In a cross-over study, a weak interaction was found subjectively but not in objective measures.", 
    "167": "This study was designed to examine the effects of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation and stress on the properties of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs). Rats were deprived of REM sleep for 96 hours by a small pedestal (water tank) method. Using radioligand assays with the selective antagonist [3H]PK11195, receptor density (Bmax) and affinity were measured in the heart and kidney in three groups: 1) REMSD group (REM sleep deprived-group), 2) TC group (tank control group; large pedestal), and 3) CC group (cage control group). REMSD group showed an increase in the density of PBRs in the heart (18%; p<0.002), but not in the kidney (-5%; p=0.058) compared to TC group, and IC group showed an increase in the density of these receptors in the heart (17%; p<0.014), and the kidney (12%; p<0.002) compared to CC group. While the cardiac Kd value was 37% (p<0.0004) and 36% (p<0.002) higher in the REMSD group than in the CC and TC groups, respectively, the renal Kd value was lower (-5%; p=0.057 and -16%; p<0.0004, respectively). The changes in PBRs observed herein are tissue- and treatment-specific, and may suggest a close functional relationship between REM sleep and PBRs.", 
    "168": "The specific mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) agonist, FGIN 1-27, and antagonist, PK 11195, were used to investigate whether this receptor was involved in passive avoidance memory formation in the day-old chick. PK 11195 at a concentration of 1-10 microM was found to be amnesic when injected directly into the lobus parolfactorius (LPO) 5 h after training (P<.01). Unilateral injections of PK 11195 further showed that memory was only disrupted with injections into the right hemisphere (P<.01). Since the MBR is considered to be involved in the production of a neurosteroid that modulates GABAergic transmission, we injected bicuculline and muscimol, specific inhibitor and agonist, respectively, of the GABA(A) receptor, to see if either disrupted memory formation. The results of bilateral injections into the LPO at 5 h post-training indicated that enhanced GABAergic transmission was involved in memory formation since the inhibitor, bicuculline, caused amnesia (P<.01) and unilateral injections also showed that this effect was confined to the right hemisphere (P<.05). Since memory for passive avoidance learning is thought to involve both cytosolic and mitochondrial protein synthesis at this 5-h time point [Freeman FM, Young IG. Chloramphenicol-induced amnesia for passive avoidance training in the day-old chick. Neurobiol Learn Mem 1999;71:80-93.], we studied the effect of unilateral injections of chloramphenicol (CAP) and anisomycin (ANI) during this second wave of protein synthesis and found that CAP only disrupted memory when injected into the right LPO 5 h post-training (P<.05). This lateralization to the right hemisphere was also seen when ANI was injected 4 h post-training (P<.05) but at 5 h, only bilateral injections of ANI could disrupt memory (P<.05). The results suggest a role for mitochondria and the GABAergic system in the retention of passive avoidance learning in the day-old chick.", 
    "169": "The responses of mice to low doses of acutely and chronically administered ethanol (2.0 g/kg) and diazepam (2.0 mg/kg) were observed in activity cages, the open field and the elevated plus-maze. After prolonged administration, ethanol significantly increased locomotion in the activity cages and the plus-maze. In the open field, an increase was only observed in the tests performed after 7 and 14 days of treatment. Ethanol increased the open-arm time in the plus-maze in all the tests, including after acute administration, suggesting an anxiolytic effect. Diazepam induced an anxiolytic effect after 14 days of daily injections but had no stimulant effect on locomotion. Moreover, after prolonged administration sensitization to the anxiolytic, but not to the stimulant effect, was observed. In short, the present paper's data support the hypothesis that the stimulant and anxiolytic effects of ethanol are probably being mediated by distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that drugs that lead to abusive use, such as ethanol, may act both as positive and negative reinforcement.", 
    "170": "Food-deprived Wistar rats were exposed to a fixed-time (FT) 60-s food delivery schedule until they developed schedule-induced drinking. Rats were matched in pairs according to their licking rates and were designated master or yoked at random. Every fifth lick by master rats was followed by an electric shock during two signalled 5-min periods, which ran concurrently with the food delivery schedule. For the master rats, shock intensities were adjusted to reduce licking to 5-30% (low suppression) or 50-75% (high suppression) of the unpunished licking rates. Yoked rats received the same shocks as master rats, but independently of their own licking. The drinking by yoked animals was not decreased by the presentation of these lick-independent shocks. Diazepam (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) was studied for its effects on punished and nonpunished schedule-induced drinking. Intermediate doses of the drug increased the punished behavior of master rats, but only when schedule-induced drinking was highly suppressed. Diazepam dose dependently decreased licking rates in all other conditions. The antipunishment effects of benzodiazepines may depend on the level of suppression of schedule-induced drinking, and this is in keeping with the results of other experimental preparations where behavior was under aversive control.", 
    "171": "In human liver microsomes, triazolam is principally metabolized by CYP3A4 to form two metabolites, 1'-hydroxytriazolam (1'OHTz) and 4-hydroxytriazolam (4OHTz). The velocity of 1'OHTz formation was found to decrease at higher triazolam concentrations (>200 microM), indicative of \"substrate inhibition\". Coincubation of [(14)C]triazolam with authentic metabolite standards of either 1'OHTz or 4OHTz up to 30 microM did not significantly inhibit the rate of [(14)C]1'OHTz formation. The effects of secondary compounds on triazolam oxidation were shown to be product-specific, producing either activation or inhibition depending on the triazolam metabolite monitored. When human liver microsomes were supplemented with exogenous human cytochrome b(5), it was observed that substrate inhibition was attenuated and the resulting increase in 1'OHTz formation, relative to control (nonsupplemented) incubations, corresponded to a decrease in the ratio of 4OHTz to 1'OHTz. In contrast, when cofactor (e.g., 100 microM NADPH) was rate limiting, the metabolite ratio (4OHTz/1'OHTz) was markedly increased over the entire substrate concentration range (0.5-1000 microM). To explain these kinetic observations, a two-site binding model is proposed in which triazolam is hypothesized to bind within the CYP3A4 active site in spatially distinct orientations, which may lead to the formation of either the 1'-hydroxytriazolam or 4-hydroxytriazolam. Differential inhibition/activation is consistent with this two-site model and substrate inhibition is hypothesized to result from competition between the two sites for reactive oxygen.", 
    "172": "A series of 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives has been previously described as noncompetitive AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonists potentially useful for treatment of epilepsy. To further explore the structure-activity relationships of AMPA antagonists, a series of 11H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,5-c][2,3]benzodiazepin-3(2H)-ones (6) was synthesized starting from the corresponding bicyclic 1-aryl-3, 5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones (2, CFM). The new compounds were found to possess anticonvulsant effects against seizures induced both by means of auditory stimulation in DBA/2 mice and by pentylenetetrazole or maximal electroshock in Swiss mice. In addition, they antagonize the AMPA-induced seizures, and their anticonvulsant activity is reversed by pretreatment with aniracetam, thus suggesting the involvement of AMPA receptors. The pharmacological studies revealed that the 11H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4, 5-c][2,3]benzodiazepin-3(2H)-ones (6) herein reported show anticonvulsant activity comparable to that of their bicyclic precursors. Furthermore, an HPLC study put in evidence that these tricyclic derivatives 6 were converted in vivo into the corresponding 2, the agents likely to be mainly responsible for the anticonvulsant properties observed.", 
    "173": "We evaluated the efficacy of clonidine given orally preoperatively for preventing postoperative vomiting (POV) in children undergoing propofol-nitrous oxide anaesthesia for strabismus surgery. Sixty children, ASA physical status I, aged 2-12 years, received diazepam, 0.4 mg x kg(-1) or clonidine, 4 microg x kg(-1) (n=30 each) orally, in a randomized double-blind manner. These drugs were given 105 min before an inhalational induction of anaesthesia. A complete response, defined as no POV and no need for rescue antiemetic medication, during 0-24 h after anaesthesia was 67% with diazepam and 93% with clonidine, respectively (P=0.024). No clinically adverse event was observed in any of the groups. In summary, pretreatment with oral clonidine enhances the antiemetic efficacy of propofol for the prevention of POV after paediatric strabismus surgery.", 
    "174": "In vitro cholecystokinin (CCK) contracts the human lower oesophageal sphincter by stimulating muscular receptors. The aim of this study was to characterize the muscular CCK receptor subtypes in the human lower oesophageal sphincter. Twenty-five circular strips from six patients were studied. RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and cDNAs were amplified with primers for human CCK-A and B receptors. The potency of the contraction induced by CCK-8, desulphated CCK-8, and gastrin-I, and the effect of the CCK-A (loxiglumide and SR 27897) and the CCK-B (YM022 and L-365 260) specific receptor antagonists were compared. Both CCK-A and CCK-B receptor mRNAs were found in functional lower oesophageal sphincter strips. The potency of the CCK-8 concentration-dependent contraction was two and three orders of magnitude higher than that of desulphated CCK-8 and gastrin-I, respectively. The CCK-8-induced contraction was blocked by the CCK-A receptor antagonists loxiglumide (IC50 11 micromol L-1) and SR 27897 (IC50 74 nmol L-1) but not by CCK-B receptor antagonists (1 micromol L-1). Our data suggest that, although the human lower oesophageal sphincter expresses both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors, the contractile effect of CCK-8 on the circular muscle is mainly due to the activation of CCK-A receptors.", 
    "175": "The advantages and disadvantages of using monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), the major metabolite of lidocaine, as a probe of hepatic function in liver transplantation are reviewed. A 'real time' test of liver function should give a measure of current hepatocellular capacity rather than reflect past damage. The hepatic metabolism of lidocaine to MEGX is the basis of a flow-dependent dynamic test of liver function. In pre-transplantation patients, data from this MEGX test support its role in assessing the risk of morbidity and mortality. In assessing the liver transplant donor, there are differences concerning its apparent usefulness and these must be resolved. In the liver transplant recipient, this MEGX test is also useful for measuring real-time hepatic metabolizing activity, and low MEGX values reflect the clinical condition of the patient. At present, however, this test has several limitations. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation, not only by the MEGX test but also by a combination of other conventional liver function tests (biochemical parameters, etc.), or with histological evaluation, is thought to be desirable for deciding whether a liver transplantation should be carried out or not."
