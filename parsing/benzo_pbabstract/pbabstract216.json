The fragmentations follow a general pattern, the details of which are discussed with respect to the nature and position of the substituent in the aromatic ring. The dihydro- and tetrahydro-1,5-benzothiazepines both undergo fragmentation through four routes (A-D). However, the most significant fragmentation takes place through route A, leading to the elimination of ring A or ring B of the molecule. The difference between the fragmentation patterns of dihydro- and tetrahydro-1,5-benzothiazepines appears mainly in route E where a phenylallylhydroxybenzene cation appears in all tetrahydro-1,5-benzothiazepines but is not observed in the corresponding dihydro derivatives.", 
    "1": "Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by mental, motor and behavioral symptoms. It occurs in up to 18 % of acute admissions and is most frequently associated with affective and psychotic disorders. It is also seen in dissociative disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, mental retardation and organic psychiatric disorders. Catatonic syndromes are impressive states that can be reliably and validly diagnosed both clinically and with psychometric measurements and they can be treated effectively. Despite this, they are often not recognized in clinical practice, are not part of the therapeutic strategy and thus remain untreated. The following article is intended to give a review of the most pertinent questions related to the diagnosis and treatment of catatonia in order to improve clinicians' ability to recognize and treat catatonic symptoms and syndromes adequately.", 
    "2": "Saccadic latency is composed of separate sensory and motor processing delays. Therefore, any alteration in the sensory processing should effect the saccadic latency. Because the highest density of benzodiazepine (Bz) binding sites is located in cerebral cortex, sensory processing of stimuli in this cortical area is expected to be substantially effected by administration of Bzs. It is well known that sensory processing of binocular disparity occurs in the cerebral cortical areas and therefore the latency of saccades to stimuli defined by binocular disparity should be substantially affected by Bz intake. In this study, we tested this prediction by comparing the latency of saccadic eye movements for binocular disparity defined stimuli (stereo stimuli) with those for luminance contrast defined stimuli (luminance stimuli), after diazepam or placebo. Eye movements were mainly recorded by use of the magnetic search coil technique, and the study was performed in a randomized, double-blind way. Although diazepam prolonged the latency of saccades for stereo and luminance stimuli, the percentage increases in saccadic latency for the stereo stimuli were significantly larger than those for the luminance stimuli. Saccadic peak velocity, and saccadic amplitude, also significantly decreased after diazepam under conditions of stereo and luminance stimuli. However, there was no significant difference for either saccadic peak velocity or amplitude between the two types of target. The results suggest that the latency of saccades to binocular disparity defined random-dot stimuli could more sensitively reflect the pharmacodynamic effects of Bzs on the cerebral cortex.",

Clinical evaluation, questionnaires from patients and bed partners, and polysomnography were obtained on all subjects in comparison with 50 age-matched controls. Subjects were examined for the presence of psychiatric anxiety, depression and any other associated sleep disorder. Isolated sleepwalking or sleepwalking with psychiatric disorders was treated with medication. All other patients with other sleep disorders were treated only for their associated problem. Prospective follow-up lasted 12 months after establishment of the most appropriate treatment. Patients with only sleepwalking, treated with benzodiazepines, dropped out of follow-up testing and reported persistence of sleepwalking, as did patients with psychiatric-related treatment. Chronic sleepwalkers frequently presented with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). All these patients were treated only for their SDB, using nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). All nasal CPAP-compliant patients had control of sleepwalking at all stages of follow-up. Non-compliant nasal CPAP patients had persistence of sleepwalking. They were offered surgical treatment for SDB. Those successfully treated with surgery also had complete resolution of sleepwalking. Successful treatment of SDB, which is frequently associated with chronic sleepwalking, controlled the syndrome in young adults.",

    "20": "GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) was isolated previously in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular loop of the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor as bait. GABARAP has been shown to participate in the membrane-clustering and intracellular-trafficking of GABA(A) receptors, including a stimulation of the surface expression of GABA(A) receptors. To assess this quantitatively, we used Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing alpha1beta2gamma2S-containing GABA(A) receptors to demonstrate that coexpression of GABARAP increased net surface levels of GABA(A) receptors as shown by both increased GABA currents and surface-expressed protein. This GABARAP stimulation of GABA currents required the receptor gamma2 subunit and full-length GABARAP: deletion of the microtubule-binding domain (amino acids 1-22) or disrupting the polymerization of microtubules abolished the enhancement, indicating that the effect of GABARAP was derived from the interaction with microtubules. GABARAP coexpression did not alter the general properties of GABA(A) receptors such as sensitivity to GABA or benzodiazepines, but it increased surface levels of receptor protein in oocytes. Rather, it seems to supplement inadequate amounts of endogenous GABARAP to support optimum trafficking and/or stabilization of surface GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "21": "Vestibular abnormalities co-existing with anxiety disorders are not uncommon and there has been a renewal of interest in recent times. Although well known over centuries, there is often a delay in the recognition of this relationship by the primary care physician and the specialist alike. Dizziness embracing vertigo, unsteadiness and imbalance are common in the elderly, so is generalized anxiety disorder, which is a common psychiatric problem in later life. This is a retrospective study of eight patients with vestibular symptoms and an anxiety disorder present over several years with lack of awareness of their relationship. The diagnoses of the anxiety disorders were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria and the effect of treatment measured on a clinician-based impression interview. There was one male and seven females and the mean age was 72 years. Apart from the vestibular symptoms present in all the patients, the anxiety disorders comprised, generalized anxiety disorder in three, panic attacks in five and with agoraphobia in three. Four patients had hyperventilation, one sleep apnea, and two somatization disorders. They had all presented to clinicians in different disciplines and had had several investigations. Five had been treated in this study with alprazolam and three with citalopram, with modest to good results. Two had rehabilitation therapy as well. The cases described mirror the well-documented co-existence of vestibular and anxiety disorders together with hyperventilation and sleep apnea. The positive findings associated with vestibular dysfunction need recognition in addition to the non-specific psychiatric and behavioral symptoms. We emphasize this relationship and review the literature to alert the clinician.", 
    "22": "A body of literature is developing which identifies an additional stage of sleep in rats, cats and mice. Intermediate stage (IS) sleep is a measurable sleep stage that is maintained by the hyperpolarization of GABA(A) containing thalamocortical neurons. The present study attempts to clarify inconsistencies within the sleep spindle literature. Most notably, inconsistencies between those that study sleep spindles in the rat outside and within the context of IS sleep. Ten male taiep rats weighing from 400 g to 600 g, and 9-12 months of age, were used in this study. The animals were given a one-time, .9 mg/kg dose of the benzodiazepine clonazepam. The control group had more seizure activity (mean = 13.4) than the treatment group (mean = 5.2, t(1-18) = 8.859, p < .001), and had a lower number of sleep spindles (mean=10.3) than the treatment group (mean = 13.3, t(1-18) = -3.4, p < .001). In addition, spectral analysis of sleep spindles during IS and seizure activity revealed that sleep spindles are within the frequency band of 8-11Hz, while seizure activity is within the 4-7 Hz range. This data supports the hypotheses that sleep spindles are distinguishable from seizure activity.", 
    "23": "In this paper we have determined the different signal pathways involved in M(1) and M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) dependent stimulation of cyclo-oxygenase 1 (cox-1) mRNA gene expression and PGE(2) production on rat cerebral frontal cortex. Carbachol stimulation of M(1) and M(3) mAChR exerts an increase in cox-1 mRNA gene expression without affecting cox-2 mRNA expression and increased PGE(2) generation. Besides, increased phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and stimulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) production. Inhibitors of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), COX and phospholipase C (PLC), calcium/calmodulin (CaM), NOS and soluble guanylate cyclase prevent the carbachol effect. These results suggest that carbachol-activation of M(1) and M(3) mAChR increased PGE(2) release associated with an increased expression of cox-1 and NO-cGMP production. The mechanism appears to occur directly to PLC stimulation and indirectly to PLA(2) activation. These results may contribute to understand the effects and side effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with cerebral degenerative diseases.", 
    "24": "Caffeine has been shown to increase brain and plasma content of neurosteroid 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) that allosterically modulates GABA(A) receptors. The present study evaluated the role of neurosteroid 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the caffeine-induced anxiogenic-like effect using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test in rats. Acute administration of caffeine (50 or 100mg/kg, i.p.) produced anxiogenic-like activity that was reversed by pretreatment with the neurosteroid 3alpha,5alpha-THP or progesterone, the GABA(A) agonist muscimol, or the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam. On the contrary, caffeine produced higher anxiety in animals previously treated with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline or either of the various neurosteroid biosynthesis enzyme inhibitors viz. trilostane, finasteride or indomethacin. Furthermore, pretreatment with DHEAS, a neurosteroid that negatively modulates GABA(A) receptors also enhanced the caffeine-induced anxiety. Moreover, adrenalectomy potentiated the anxiogenic-like response of caffeine indicating the contributory role of peripheral steroidogenesis. Thus, it is speculated that neurosteroid 3alpha,5alpha-THP through positive modulation of GABA(A) receptor activity may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism against caffeine-induced anxiety.",

In addition, we found an increasing proportion of patients receiving two or more psychotropic drugs at discharge, which accounted for almost 80% of cases in 2001/02. The number of psychotropic agents prescribed at hospital discharge was positively correlated with the total consumption of psychotropic drugs. A relevant proportion of patients were also dispensed agents for medical conditions, yielding an average number of 3.2 prescriptions in 2001/02.

Frequencies of elevation greater than the reference level in any enzyme among aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphotase (ALP) were higher in the olanzapine-treated group (26.9%) than in the risperidone-treated group (14.2%) [odds ratio (OR)=2.225, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.362-3.638, P=0.002]. Frequencies of elevation greater than the reference level in ALT were higher in the olanzapine-treated group than in the risperidone-treated group (OR=2.182, P=0.004), as were frequencies with two-fold (OR=3.064, P=0.017) and three-fold (OR=2.883, P=0.039) elevation. Recovery time was longer in the olanzapine-treated group than in the risperidone-treated group (P=0.0059), as was latency time (P=0.0044). These results suggest that there are potential differences in antipsychotic-associated hepatic enzyme alterations between risperidone and olanzapine treatment. Controlled, prospective studies should be conducted to identify the risk factors associated with an alteration in hepatic enzymes related to treatment with risperidone and olanzapine.",

    "37": "Osteoporosis, a key predictor of hip fractures can be treated using a variety of safe and effective interventions. Nevertheless, optimally effective strategies for the prevention of hip fractures must also incorporate efforts to address a broad range of other potentially reversible factors. Hyperthyroidism, anticonvulsants, caffeine and smoking may decrease bone mass and increase fracture risk at any age. In older individuals it is important to also consider additional risk factors, including long-acting benzodiazepines, poor vision and sarcopenia. The presence of sarcopenia, an age-related decline in muscle bulk and quality enhances the risk of frailty and possibly also hip fracture, particularly if associated with diminished functional mobility, lower quadriceps strength and poor balance or body sway. In this review we examine evidence which indicates the presence of endocrine-immune dysregulation in both osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Post-menopausal declines in serum estrogen and androgen levels contribute to increases in local bone levels of cytoclastic cytokines, followed by increased osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. Similarly, the presence of decreased gonadal hormones and IGF-1, combined with unusually high peripheral levels of cytokines, inflammatory mediators and coagulation markers all enhance the risk of sarcopenia and frailty. We propose that a translational research approach which emphasizes common pathophysiologic mechanisms in osteoporosis and sarcopenia could accelerate the speed of discovery of effective strategies for both frailty and hip fracture prevention.",

We followed up (for 12 months) a group of 346 consecutive outpatients, with a diagnosis of subcortical vascular dementia or multi-infarctual dementia. Patients eligible for this open-label study were required to have behavioral problems (BPSD). Patients were divided into two groups, Group A received olanzapine 2.5-7.5 mg/day while Group B received typical antipsychotics. Patients in both groups were allowed to continue any previous therapy. Patients in both groups were significantly improved in their BPSD. Our patients had a host of medical conditions and received numerous concomitant medications. Given the potential complications associated with these therapeutic agents, these patients tolerated olanzapine quite well. On examination of consequences of adverse events, particularly somnolence, postural instability, and postural hypotension, it appeared that cerebrovascular events were not present.

    "61": "The prevalence of obesity has increased 15% up to 20% and represents an important challenge for the anesthesiologist in drug-dosing management. The aim of this work is to provide an overview on physiological changes and pharmacokinetic implications of obesity for the anesthesiologist. Obesity increases both fat and lean masses; however, the percentage of fat tissue increases more than does the lean mass, affecting the apparent volume of distribution of anesthetic drugs according to their lipid solubility. Benzodiazepine loading doses should be adjusted on actual weight, and maintenance doses should be adjusted on ideal body weight. Thiopental sodium and propofol dosages are calculated on total body weight (TBW). The loading dose of lipophilic opioids is based on TBW, whereas maintenance dosages should be cautiously reduced because of the higher sensitivity of the obese patient to their depressant effects. Pharmacokinetic parameters of muscle relaxants are minimally affected by obesity, and their dosage is based on ideal rather than TBW. Inhalation anesthetics with very low lipid solubility, such as sevoflurane and desflurane, allow for quick modification of the anesthetic plan during surgery and rapid emergence at the end of surgery, hence representing very flexible anesthetic drugs for use in this patient population. Drug dosing is generally based on the volume of distribution for the loading dose and on the clearance for maintenance. In the obese patient, the volume of distribution is increased if the drug is distributed both in lean and fat tissues whereas the anesthetic drug clearance is usually normal or increased.", 
    "62": "This paper updates an early review on benzodiazepine-enhanced food intake, published in the first issue of Appetite, and describes the considerable advances since then in the pharmacology of benzodiazepines, their sites and mechanisms of action, and in understanding the psychological processes leading to the increase in food consumption. A great diversity of benzodiazepine receptor ligands have been developed, many of which affect food intake. Agonists can be divided into full agonists (which produce the full spectrum of benzodiazepine effects) and partial agonists (which are more selective in their effects). In addition, inverse agonists have been identified, with high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors but having negative efficacy: these drugs exhibit anorectic properties. Benzodiazepine receptors are part of GABA(A) receptor complexes, and ligands thereby modulate inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Molecular approaches have identified a palette of receptor subunits from which GABA(A) receptors are assembled. In all likelihood, benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia is mediated by the alpha2/alpha3 subtype not the alpha1 subtype. Novel alpha2/alpha3 selective compounds will test this hypothesis. A probable site of action in the caudal brainstem for benzodiazepines is the parabrachial nucleus. Behavioural evidence strongly indicates that a primary action of benzodiazepines is to enhance the positive hedonic evaluation (palatability) of tastes and foodstuffs. This generates the increased food intake and instrumental responding for food rewards. Therapeutic applications may derive from the actions of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists on food procurement and ingestion.",

    "64": "An analytical procedure was developed for the simultaneous sensitive identification, screening and quantitation of 30 drugs of abuse using 250 microl of human oral fluid. The method employs sequential mixed-mode solid-phase extraction (SPE), optimized derivative formation and long-column fast gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS). After sequential SPE elution, the most sensitive and stable derivatives were formed by taking careful account of the characteristics of the active functional groups and possible steric hindrances affecting derivatization chemistry. Amphetamine-type stimulant drugs were acylated with heptafluorobutyric anhydride, benzodiazepines and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol were silylated with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and benzoylecgonine, codeine, ethylmorphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine, pholcodine, buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. In addition, the following analytes were included: methadone, cocaine, alprazolam, midazolam, fentanyl and zolpidem. In GC separation, fast temperature ramping and high carrier gas flow-rate combined with long 30 m columns of i.d. 0.32 mm offered a reduction in analysis time and sharp peak shapes while still maintaining sufficient resolution and high sample capacity. Validated parameters including selectivity, linearity, accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision, extraction efficiency and limit of quantitation were all within required limits.

    "80": "Changes in the function of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are associated with neuronal development and tolerance to the sedative-hypnotic effects of GABA(A)R positive modulators. Persistent activation of GABA(A)Rs by millimolar concentrations of GABA occurs under physiological conditions as GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in neocortex and cerebellum exhibit basal firing rates of 5 to 50 Hz and intermittent rates up to 250 Hz, leaving a substantial fraction of synaptic receptors occupied persistently by GABA. Persistent exposure of neurons to GABA has been shown to cause a down-regulation of receptor number and an uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine (BZD) site interactions with a half-life of approximately 24 h. Here, we report that a single brief exposure of neocortical neurons in primary culture to GABA for 5-10 min (t(1/2) = 3.2 +/- 0.2 min) initiates a process that results in uncoupling hours later (t(1/2) = 12.1 +/- 2.2 h). Initiation of delayed-onset uncoupling is blocked by co-incubation with picrotoxin or alpha-amanitin but is insensitive to nifedipine, indicating that uncoupling is contingent upon receptor activation and transcription but is not dependent on voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. Delayed-onset uncoupling occurs without a change in receptor number or a change in the proportion of alpha1 subunit pharmacology, as zolpidem binding affinity is unaltered. Such activity dependent latent modulation of GABA(A)R function that manifests as delayed-onset uncoupling may be relevant to physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological conditions where synaptic receptors are transiently exposed to GABA agonists for several minutes.",

We compared charges for other mental health services associated with risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine treatment of patients with bipolar disorder to assess whether there were significant differences between these therapies. A secondary analysis involved dose-equivalent adjustment of the average allowed charge of the 3 atypical antipsychotics.",

Provider-submitted (billed) charges were selected in preference to paid amounts as being more accurate indicators of relative differences in the use of mental health resources. Mental health care charges were measured per patient per month (PPPM) and included charges for the study antipsychotics and charges for the other mental health care services (inpatient, physician and other ambulatory, and other psychotropic medications). Differences in other mental health care charges PPPM among the 3 therapies were assessed with multivariate regression, adjusting for differing patient characteristics.

The developing GABAergic system is highly plastic, and the long-term effects of postnatal treatment with these drugs on the GABAergic system has not been extensively examined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of prolonged DZ and PH treatment during postnatal development and then discontinuation on expression of a variety of genes involved in GABAergic neurotransmission during adulthood. Rat pups were treated with DZ, PH or vehicle from postnatal day (P) 10-P40 and then the dose was tapered for 2 weeks and terminated at P55. Expression of GABAR subunits, GABAB receptor subunits, GABA transporters (GAT) and GABA synthesizing enzymes (glutamic acid decarboxylase: GAD) mRNAs in hippocampal dentate granule neurons (DGNs) were analyzed using antisense RNA amplification at P90. Protein levels for the alpha1 subunit of GABAR, GAD67, GAT1 and 3 were also assessed using Western blotting. At P90, mRNA expression for GAT-1, 3, 4, GABAR subunits alpha4, alpha6, beta3, delta and theta and GABAB receptor subunit R1 was increased and mRNA expression for GAD65, GAD67 and GABAR subunits alpha1 and alpha3 were decreased in DGNs of rats treated with DZ and PH. The current data suggest that prolonged DZ and PH treatment during postnatal development causes permanent alterations in the expression of hippocampal GABA receptor subunits, GATs and GAD long after therapy has ended.",

In this study the expression of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in first trimester pons, medulla oblongata and cerebellum from abortus (5-12 weeks of gestation) of smoking and nonsmoking women was compared. A significant age-related increase in binding of nicotinic receptor subtype alpha4 was found in both pons and cerebellum only in fetal tissue from non-smoking women, while a similar increase was observed in medulla oblongata from fetuses exposed to smoking. A significant age-related increase in binding of muscarinic receptor subtype m2 was observed in pons from abortus of smoking compared with non-smoking women. The gene expression pattern of both alpha4 and alpha7 nicotinic receptor subunits was changed after smoking in all three regions investigated. Smoking also changed the expression of m1 and 2 muscarinic receptor mRNA in pons, m1 mRNA in cerebellum and the m3 mRNA in medulla oblongata.

Healthy subjects with previous but no current complaints of transient insomnia were enrolled. Transient insomnia was induced in the sleep laboratory by means of the 'first night' effect and by implementing a 2-h phase advance. The effects of both doses of temazepam on polysomnographic measures of sleep were evaluated for 1 night. The primary, prospectively-defined analysis of this study showed that 7.5-mg and 15-mg doses of temazepam had equivalent effects on latency to persistent sleep, total sleep time, and the number of sleep interruptions recorded over an 8-h period.

In in vitro studies using human liver and intestinal microsomes and cDNA-expressed human CYP and FMO isoenzymes, quazepam was rapidly metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a minor extent by CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and FMO1 to 2-oxoquazepam (OQ), which was then further biotransformed to N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (DOQ) and to 3-hydroxy-2-oxoquazepam (HOQ) mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. CYP3A4 is the enzyme predominantly responsible for all the metabolic pathways of quazepam. Itraconazole inhibited the formation of OQ from quazepam, HOQ from OQ and DOQ from OQ in human liver microsomes with Ki values of 8.40, 0.08 and 0.39 microM, respectively. However, the Ki for OQ formation was greater than the peak plasma itraconazole concentration following a clinically relevant 200-mg oral dose to healthy volunteers. In addition, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inhibitors failed to inhibit OQ formation from quazepam. In conclusion, clinically relevant drug interaction with CYP inhibitors seem unlikely for the major metabolic pathway of quazepam to OQ.",

The stomach was perfused with saline, and GMBF was measured by using hydrogen gas clearance technique. The acid production under combined action of both blockers was lower by 57.3% and 18.6%, than in case of separate action of gastrocepine and verapamile accordingly. Pepsin concentration decreased by 32%, which did not differ from verapamile action alone. The above changes of gastric secretion was accompanied by significant decrease of GMBF. Inhibition of M1-cholinergic receptors by gastrocepine did not show their key role in basal gastric secretion in rats, but they exacerbate L-Ca2+-channels blocker action. We conclude, that enhance of acid output inhibition is related to the simultaneous depression of nervous impulses in ganglionic neurons and acethylcholine release from parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. Synchronous block of M1-cholinergic receptors and L-Ca2+-channels of smooth muscles stomach vessels resulted in reducing of gastric mucosal blood flow.",

    "100": "Hypoxia is the most common cause of perinatal seizures and can be refractory to conventional anticonvulsant drugs, suggesting an age-specific form of epileptogenesis. A model of hypoxia-induced seizures in immature rats reveals that seizures result in immediate activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) in area CA1 of hippocampus. After seizures, CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibit a downregulation of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated inhibition that was reversed by CaN inhibitors. CaN activation appears to be dependent on seizure-induced activation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (AMPARs), because the upregulation of CaN activation and GABA(A)R inhibition were attenuated by GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride] or Joro spider toxin. GABA(A)R beta2/3 subunit protein was dephosphorylated at 1 h after seizures, suggesting this subunit as a possible substrate of CaN in this model. Finally, in vivo administration of the CaN inhibitor FK-506 significantly suppressed hypoxic seizures, and posttreatment with NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfonyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline) or FK-506 blocked the hypoxic seizure-induced increase in CaN expression. These data suggest that Ca2+-permeable AMPARs and CaN regulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in a novel plasticity pathway that may play a role in epileptogenesis in the immature brain.",

Most treatments for such cancer involve chemotherapy to induce the apoptotic process. While these therapies often result in disease control for periods of time, failure to initiate apoptosis as a result of acquired resistance limits the effectiveness of treatment for many common hematopoietic and solid malignancies, and ultimately death from the malignancy still occurs. Various anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family that localize to the mitochondria appear to be involved in this resistance mechanism. However, recent advances in the understanding of malignant cell biology, achieved through both genomics and proteomics, have made it possible to explore novel approaches directed at re-establishing sensitivity to chemotherapy, presenting an attractive strategy for cancer treatment. In this article we discuss how this may be achieved by lowering Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein expression using antisense oligonucleotides or, alternatively, by functionally antagonizing Bcl-2 using ligands of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor.",

There was significant improvement in the well-being of the child during the activities of daily living and this reduced the family's burden of caring for the child. In this double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, each child received a bedtime dose of diazepam or placebo. The bedtime diazepam relaxed the muscles and this made the passive stretching easy and the movements sustained the muscle relaxation during the day.

Direct injection was possible by using a short C 18, LC column (2 mm x 20 mm) with large particle diameter packing (10 microm). Analytical characteristics of the direct injection technique were studied by examining matrix effects, which showed suppression of the ESI signal between 0.20 and 0.65 min.

The precision and accuracy of the control samples for the quantitation of dextromethorphan was between -0.53 and -12.80, and 3.73 and 6.69% respectively. Unlike conventional incubation techniques, incubations were carried out in an autosampler equipped with a heating accessory. This novel incubation method, which involved no stirring of the incubation mixture, estimated the Cl(int in vitro) for dextromethorphan and midazolam in human liver microsomes to be 1.65+/-0.22 ml/(hmg) and 0.861 ml/(min mg) respectively. The autosampler tray maintained uniform temperature and was sensitive to changes in temperature between 33 and 41 degrees C. High-throughput screening was performed using known inhibitors of the CYP 2D6 isozyme, and the system was evaluated for its ability to differentiate between these inhibitors. The strong inhibitor quinidine resulted in a 25.6% increase in t(1/2), the medium potency inhibitor chlorpromazine resulted in an increase of 6.14% and the weak inhibitor primaquine had no significant effect on half-life. This technique involves no sample preparation, demonstrated run times of 2 min per injection and can be fully automated. The method should therefore prove to be a valuable tool in the drug discovery process.", 
    "113": "Diltiazem (DTZ) is an optically active calcium channel blocker having a benzodiazepine structure. The drug used in therapy is (+)-cis-diltiazem with configuration (2S,3S). To describe the analytical profile of DTZ different stationary phases (RP-18, RP-8, monolithic support) were tested. The best separation of DTZ from A, B, E and F was obtained using as stationary phase a RP-8 or a monolithic RP-18. The characterization of impurities was carried out using two analytical systems, HPLC and HPLC/MS.", 
    "114": "There are few controlled studies evaluating the treatment of bipolar mixed states. Evidence suggests that mixed states may be more responsive to some anticonvulsants than to lithium. Olanzapine alone or in combination with divalproate or lithium has been adequately evaluated in randomized clinical trials involving mixed-state patients, whereas risperidone and quetiapine have not. There is also some evidence demonstrating the efficacy of ziprasidone and aripiprazole. The risk of switching to depression is high in mixed states. Conventional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, may be less efficacious at protecting against a switch to depression than atypical antipsychotics, divalproate or lithium. When choosing drugs for the treatment of mania, and especially for the treatment of mixed states, their efficacy against manic and depressive symptoms, and their safety in terms of the risk of switching to depression should be taken into account.", 
    "115": "As the phenomenology of pediatric bipolar disorder has become better delineated, clinicians are now able to more accurately assess and treat young people suffering from this condition. For pediatric patients with bipolar I disorder and symptoms of mania, medication monotherapy has been shown to lead to symptom amelioration. However, this treatment modality oftentimes does not lead to full symptom remission. In an attempt to address this observation, combination treatment strategies have recently been investigated. Recently, a maintenance study has shown that in youths who achieved remission on a combination of lithium and divalproate therapy, either of these agents alone was equally effective as a treatment strategy. In youths identified as being at genetic high risk for bipolarity who also had problematic affective symptomatology, treatment with divalproate was not found to be superior to placebo; however, those with the greatest degree of genetic risk for familial psychopathology remained in the trial longer than those with more modest amounts of familial psychopathology. These data suggest that intervention in youths with only one affected parent may not be a rational prevention strategy for pharmacological intervention in bipolar disorder, and that cohorts more genetically at risk may be a more appropriate group for preventative pharmacotherapy.", 
    "116": "The emergency treatment of seizures is an important practical issue, in particular the therapy of status epilepticus. Antiepileptic drugs for this condition should be easy to use, show rapid action, have a long-lasting antiepileptic effect, and have minimal cardiopulmonary and other side-effects. Unfortunately, none of the presently available medications such as phenytoin and barbiturates seems to have all of these four properties. Intravenous valproate became available some years ago and first experiences show promising safety data and efficacy results.", 
    "117": "We report a series of 102 adult patients who received standardized high dosage intravenous valproate in various emergency situations, including status epilepticus. The therapeutic goal was persistent seizure control, defined as successful interruption of clinical seizure activity within less than 15 min, followed by seizure freedom during intravenous therapy for at least 12h. All side effects were documented.", 
    "118": "In 83/97 patients (85.6%) the therapeutic goal was achieved. Serious side effects were not documented in any patient. In particular there was no evidence of sedation, cardiorespiratory disturbances and hypotension as often seen in barbiturates and phenytoin. Mild side effects occurred in seven cases (6.9%).", 
    "119": "The intravenous application of VPA seems to be an easy-to-use, safe and efficient formulation as an alternative to phenytoin in all seizure emergency situations including status epilepticus. Further controlled comparison studies have to be performed in the future.", 
    "120": "Weight gain is a prominent effect of most atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs); yet, the mechanisms are not fully understood and no well-established mouse models exist for investigating the mechanisms. Thus, we developed a mouse model to evaluate the effects of AAPDs on eating, body weight (BW), and body composition.", 
    "121": "Female C57BL/6J mice were used to test olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone. Mice were acclimated to individual housing, given ad libitum access to chow and water, dosed with placebo peanut butter pills for 1 week, and then dosed daily with AAPD-laced peanut butter pills for 4 weeks. Weekly food intakes and BWs were measured, and body compositions were determined at the end of each experiment.", 
    "122": "After 4 weeks of treatment, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone caused significant weight increases, but only olanzapine and quetiapine were associated with significantly increased food intake. Body composition data revealed that olanzapine-treated mice had more relative fat mass and risperidone-treated mice had more relative lean mass than did control mice. Quetiapine and ziprasidone did not significantly affect relative body composition even though BW was increased.", 
    "123": "Oral AAPD administration causes increased BW in female mice. Our mouse model of AAPD-induced weight gain resembles the human response to these medications and will be used to investigate the mechanisms for weight gain and fat accumulation.",

In this study, we evaluated the effect and mechanism(s) of the action of thymoquinone more precisely via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection.", 
    "125": "The anticonvulsant effects of thymoquinone, the major constituent of Nigella sativa seeds, were investigated using the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure model. The animals were placed individually in plastic boxes and observed immediately after PTZ injection for a period of 30 min. The latency to and the duration of tonic-clonic seizures were recorded, as well as the percentages of protection against the incidence of seizure and mortality.", 
    "126": "In PTZ-induced epileptic seizures, the i.c.v. injection of thymoquinone at doses of 200 and 400 microM prolonged the time until onset and reduced the duration of tonic-clonic seizures. The protective effect of thymoquinone against lethality was 45% and 50% in the respective doses. In this study, flumazenil (1 nM, i.c.v.) reversed the anticonvulsant activity of thymoquinone. Also, pretreatment with naloxone (10 microM, i.c.v.) antagonized the prolongation of tonic-clonic seizure latency as well as the reduction in seizure duration induced by thymoquinone (200 microM, i.c.v.).", 
    "127": "These results indicate that thymoquinone may have anticonvulsant activity, probably through an opioid receptor-mediated increase in GABAergic tone.", 
    "128": "An isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with column switching and ultraviolet (UV) detection is described for quantitative analysis of the new antipsychotic drug ziprasidone. After centrifugation of serum or plasma samples and addition of fluperlapine as internal standard, the samples were injected into the HPLC system. On-line sample clean-up was conducted on a column (10 x 4.0 mm ID) filled with silica C8 material (20-microm particle size) using 8% (vol/vol) acetonitrile in deionized water as eluent. Ziprasidone was eluted and separated on ODS Hypersil C18 material (5 microm; column size 250 x 4.6 mm ID) using acetonitrile-water-tetramethylethylendiamine (50:49.6:0.4, vol/vol/vol). The UV detector was set at 254 nm. Ziprasidone was separated within 20 minutes. The limit of quantification was 10 ng/mL. At therapeutic concentrations, the interassay reproducibility (coefficient of variation) of quality control samples was below 10%. The method was found to be robust and stable. More than 100 serum samples could be analyzed without changing the clean-up column and more than 300 samples using the same analytic column. Among multiple drugs tested for interference, only the tricyclic antidepressants trimipramine and clomipramine were found to exhibit retention times similar to that of ziprasidone. The method was applied to analyze ziprasidone concentrations in blood serum of 67 patients treated with 40 to 280 mg ziprasidone per day for at least 7 days (median 120 mg). The median steady-state serum concentration of ziprasidone was 76 ng/mL, and the 25th and 75th percentile were 43 to 131 ng/mL, respectively. Forty to 130 ng/mL may be considered the recommended target plasma concentration range. HPLC with column switching and UV detection as described here is suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring of ziprasidone.",

    "130": "In a randomised cross-over study, the spontaneous EEG was recorded in nine healthy subjects after i.v. lorazepam or placebo. Intracerebral current densities within classical frequency bands were estimated with low resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA] and compared between groups with t-statistical parametric mapping [SPM[t]]. A region-of-interest [ROI] based method was used to compare frontal and occipital alpha band activity changes.", 
    "131": "Irrespective of treatment group, local maxima of alpha band power were localised both in the occipital lobe, Brodman area [BA] 18, and in the anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], BA 32. Statistical parametric mapping showed reduced parieto-occipital, but unaltered frontal alpha band power after lorazepam. This result was confirmed by ROI-based comparison of BA 18 and BA 32.", 
    "132": "There was an anterior limbic maximum of alpha band activity which, unlike occipital alpha, was not suppressed by lorazepam.",

    "134": "Nerve agent poisoning is characterized by the rapid progression of toxic signs, including hypersecretions, tremor, convulsions and profound brain damage. In the political arena of today's world, the threat of nerve agent use against military troops has prompted armies to search for prophylactic protection. The two main strategies for prophylaxis include biological scavengers that can bind or cleave nerve agents before they react with acetylcholinesterase, and antidotes as prophylactic treatment. Pyridostigmine is the current pretreatment for nerve agent poisoning and is in use by most of the armed forces in Western countries. However, since pyridostigmine barely crosses the blood-brain barrier it provides no protection against nerve agent-induced central injury. Pyridostigmine is ineffective when administered without post-exposure treatment adjuncts. Therefore, other directions for prophylactic treatment should be explored. These include combinations of carbamates (reversible AChE inhibitors) and central anticholinergics or NMDA receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines or partial agonists for benzodiazepine receptor, and other central AChE inhibitors approved for Alzheimer's disease. The transdermal route is an alternative way for delivering the prophylactic agent. Administration of prophylaxis can be extended also for civilian use during wartime.", 
    "135": "The polarity of action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) changes from inhibition to excitation in the developing brain and in epilepsies. This review deals with recent observations concerning the mechanisms and clinical implications of the shift in GABA's activity from inhibition to excitation.", 
    "136": "GABAergic synapses provide most transmitter-gated inhibition and are the targets of numerous clinically active agents, notably antiepileptic drugs. In a wide range of brain structures and species, GABAergic synapses are excitatory during maturation because of a higher concentration of intracellular chloride. These findings suggest that activation of GABA synapses will excite foetal neurones while inhibiting those of the mother. In epilepsies, recurrent seizures also lead to an accumulation of chloride and an excitatory action of GABA. These observations have major implications for clinical practice and research. They suggest that use of benzodiazepines by pregnant mothers may lead to deleterious consequences when they are taken during the period when GABA is the main excitatory transmitter. Because neuronal activity alters important cell functions, including migration and morphogenesis, aberrant excessive excitation may lead to profound deleterious consequences.", 
    "137": "In several physiological and pathological conditions, activation of GABAergic synapses excites neurones instead of producing classical inhibition. This shift, which is due to an intracellular accumulation of chloride, has major consequences for both the operation of networks and the pathogenic effects of epilepsies. This is particularly important in the immature brain, where the excitatory actions of GABA are particularly prominent.", 
    "138": "Classic benzodiazepine agonists induce their clinical effects by binding to a site on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors and enhancing receptor activity. There are conflicting data regarding whether the benzodiazepine site is allosterically coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid binding versus the channel open-close (gating) equilibrium. The authors tested the hypothesis that benzodiazepine site ligands modulate alpha1beta2gamma2L GABAA receptor gating both in the absence of orthosteric agonists and when the orthosteric sites are occupied.", 
    "139": "GABAA receptors were recombinantly expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using two-microelectrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. To test gating effects in the absence of orthosteric agonist, the authors used spontaneously active GABAA receptors containing a leucine-to-threonine mutation at residue 264 on the alpha1 subunit. To examine effects on gating when orthosteric sites were fully occupied, they activated wild-type receptors with high concentrations of a partial agonist, piperidine-4-sulfonic acid.", 
    "140": "In the absence of orthosteric agonists, the channel activity of alpha1L264Tbeta2gamma2L receptors was increased by diazepam and midazolam and reduced by the inverse benzodiazepine agonist FG7142. Flumazenil displayed very weak agonism and blocked midazolam from further activating mutant channels. In wild-type receptors activated with saturating concentrations of piperidine-4-sulfonic acid, midazolam increased maximal efficacy.", 
    "141": "Independent of orthosteric site occupancy, classic benzodiazepines modulate the gating equilibrium in alpha1beta2gamma2L GABAA receptors and are therefore allosteric coagonists. A Monod-Wyman-Changeux coagonist gating model quantitatively predicts these effects, suggesting that benzodiazepines minimally alter orthosteric ligand binding.", 
    "142": "Amnesia for aversive events caused by benzodiazepines or propofol depends on the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Whether the amnesia of volatile anesthesia is also mediated through the BLA is unknown. If so, a general principle of anesthetic-induced amnesia may be emerging. Here, using an inhibitory avoidance paradigm, the authors determine whether BLA lesions prevent sevoflurane-induced amnesia.",

After a 1-week recovery, the rats were randomly assigned to be trained during either air or sevoflurane (0.3% inspired, 0.14 minimum alveolar concentration) exposure. Animals learned to remain in the starting safe compartment of a step-through inhibitory avoidance apparatus for 100 consecutive seconds by administering foot shock (0.3 mA) whenever they entered an adjacent shock compartment. Memory was assessed at 24 h. Longer latencies to enter the shock compartment at 24 h imply better memory.", 
    "144": "Sham-air (n = 10) animals had a robust memory, with a median retention latency of 507 s (interquartile range, 270-600 s). Sham-sevoflurane (n = 6) animals were amnesic, with a latency of 52 s (27-120 s) (P < 0.01, vs. sham-air). Both the air-exposed (n = 5) and the sevoflurane-exposed (n = 8) animals with BLA lesions showed robust memory, with latencies of 350 s (300-590 s) and 378 s (363-488 s), respectively. The latencies for both did not differ from the performance of the sham-air group and were significantly greater than the latency of the sham-sevoflurane group (both P < 0.01).",

Sixty-five patients were enrolled in the study and hypotension developed after anaesthesia in 36 (18 in the control group and 18 in the ACE inhibitor group). These patients received PE infusions, which were increased in a stepwise fashion at 10-min intervals. Increased mean arterial pressure due to PE infusion was significant only in the control group. There was no significant difference in pressor response or change in haemodynamic variables with PE infusion between the two groups. Treatment with ACE inhibitors did not increase the incidence of hypotensive episodes or significantly modify pressor response after anaesthesia in patients with valvular heart disease.",

    "149": "One hundred and ninety-one cases were identified. In most instances, abuse involved a first experience or was sporadic. The users were often boys (70%). The substances were solvents (48.7%) used collectively (33%) during recreational activities (74%). Illicit drugs accounted for 28.2% of the cases involving a first experience (89%), with polyconsumption accounting for 50%, cannabis 57.6%, ecstasy 25.9%, and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) 12.1% of cases. Medicines were also used (16%), the most frequent being benzodiazepines (51.6%).",

In order to assist this commission, several centres for evaluation and information on pharmacodependence (CEIP) were created throughout in France. Recently, in order to complete their epidemiological tools, several centres have developed another pharmacoepidemiological approach using data for refunded prescriptions obtained from the local and regional French Health Insurance database. This article underlines the potential contribution of the Health Insurance database to improving knowledge of drug use in the real-life conditions based on studies performed by the CEIP. Several examples are given showing the extent of the possibilities (population-based studies, cohort studies, development of misuse indicators). In spite of their limitations (e.g. the difference between consumption and delivery), these examples confirm that these database may be a novel tool for CEIP to assess a potential abuse of a medication.", 
    "152": "Many reports demonstrate that extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MFs, 60 Hz) may be involved in hyperalgesia. In a previous investigation, we suggested that MFs may produce hyperalgesia and such a response may be regulated by the benzodiazepine system. In order to further confirm this effect of MFs, we used diazepam and/or flumazenil with MFs exposure. When testing the pain threshold of rats using hot plate tests, MFs or diazepam (0.5 microg, i.c.v.; a benzodiazepine receptor agonist) induced hyperalgesic effects with the reduction of latency. These effects were blocked by a pretreatment of flumazenil (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.; a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist). When the rats were exposed simultaneously to MFs and diazepam, the latency tended to decrease without statistical significance. The induction of hyperalgesia by co-exposure to MFs and diazepam was also blocked by flumazenil. However, the pretreatment of GABA receptor antagonists such as bicuculline (0.1 microg, i.c.v.; a GABA(A) antagonist) or phaclofen (10 microg, i.c.v.; a GABA(B) antagonist) did not antagonize the hyperalgesic effect of MFs. These results suggest that the benzodiazepine system may be involved in MFs-induced hyperalgesia.",

A bolus dose of 0.05 mg/kg intravenous midazolam was applied to each patient. Remifentanil was administered (group MR) by patient controlled infusion (PCI) either in the first or the second operation. In the other operation, a placebo (group MP) was given in the same manner. Perioperative blood samples were obtained to determine the changes in the stress hormone (aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], renin) levels. Vital signs and oxygen saturation were recorded. Ramsey's sedation scale and modified Steward's recovery scale was used for evaluation of consciousness. Pain, patient satisfaction, cooperation score, reaction to local anesthetic injection, and degree of amnesia were also assessed.", 
    "155": "Remifentanil significantly increased the level of sedation, patient cooperation, and satisfaction; decreased the oxygen saturation, heart rate, and pain. While renin levels were significantly different, ACTH and aldosteron levels did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Aldosterone and ACTH levels significantly decreased, whereas the renin level significantly increased in both groups during the operations. Remifentanil did not significantly alter the recovery time.",

    "157": "GABA transporter subtype 1 (GAT1) knock-out (KO) mice display normal reproduction and life span but have reduced body weight (female, -10%; male, -20%) and higher body temperature fluctuations in the 0.2-1.5/h frequency range. Mouse GAT1 (mGAT1) KO mice exhibit motor disorders, including gait abnormality, constant 25-32 Hz tremor, which is aggravated by flunitrazepam, reduced rotarod performance, and reduced locomotor activity in the home cage. Open-field tests show delayed exploratory activity, reduced rearing, and reduced visits to the central area, with no change in the total distance traveled. The mGAT1 KO mice display no difference in acoustic startle response but exhibit a deficiency in prepulse inhibition. These open-field and prepulse inhibition results suggest that the mGAT1 KO mice display mild anxiety or nervousness. The compromised GABA uptake in mGAT1 KO mice results in an increased GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic conductance in both cerebellar granule and Purkinje cells. The reduced rate of GABA clearance from the synaptic cleft is probably responsible for the slower decay of spontaneous IPSCs in cerebellar granule cells. There is little or no compensatory change in other proteins or structures related to GABA transmission in the mGAT1 KO mice, including GAT1-independent GABA uptake, number of GABAergic interneurons, and GABA(A)-, vesicular GABA transporter-, GAD65-, and GAT3-immunoreactive structures in cerebellum or hippocampus. Therefore, the excessive extracellular GABA present in mGAT1 KO mice results in behaviors that partially phenocopy the clinical side effects of tiagabine, suggesting that these side effects are inherent to a therapeutic strategy that targets the widely expressed GAT1 transporter system.", 
    "158": "Various incubation conditions of human hepatocytes were compared for their accuracy in predicting the in vivo hepatic clearance (CL(H)) of model compounds. The test compounds were the highly cleared, low protein bound naloxone (in vivo CL(H) = 25 ml min(-1) kg(-1); free fraction = 0.6), the medium clearance, highly protein bound midazolam (CL(H) = 12 ml min(-1) kg(-1); free fraction = 0.04) and the low clearance, highly protein bound bosentan (CL(H) = 3.9 ml min(-1) kg(-1); free fraction = 0.02). Each compound was tested in three 'hepatocyte systems', using resections from three donors, in the presence and absence of human serum. Those hepatocyte systems were: conventional primary cultures, freshly isolated suspensions and cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes. Except for a twofold overestimated CL(H) for bosentan from conventional primary cultures, and despite variable cryopreservation recoveries, similar predictions of CL(H) were recorded with all hepatocyte systems. Moreover, the CL(H) values obtained with cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes were similar to those obtained with freshly isolated suspensions. For midazolam and bosentan, the predicted in vivo CL(H) was markedly higher in the presence of serum, whereas serum had little influence on the scaled-up CL(H) of naloxone. In vivo, CL(H) was properly approached for naloxone and bosentan (particularly from experiments in the presence of serum), but it was strongly underestimated for midazolam (particularly in the absence of serum). Additional compounds need to be investigated to confirm the above findings as well as to assess why the clearances of some highly protein-bound compounds are still considerably underestimated.",

Induction was performed with a circle-absorber breathing circuit, primed with sevoflurane 7% in 100% O2. Success of the single-breath vital capacity, delay of induction, hemodynamic and airway tolerance, acceptance by the children and side effects were analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors associated with the failure of the vital capacity technique.",

The success rate highly correlated with age and ranged from 10% in 4-5 years old to 75% at 11 years and 95% by 14 years. Other factors for success were cooperation and understanding. The need for more than two explanations of the technique was predictive of failure. Delays in the loss of the eyelash reflex and central pupil myosis were obtained in 34 s (18-50) and 242 s (145-278), respectively [median (interquartile ranges)]. Hemodynamic tolerance was good with few airway complications.",

The most common technique is sedative premedication with midazolam. Hypnosis enables a state of relaxation to be achieved and has never been evaluated as a premedication technique. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of hypnosis on anxiety and perioperative behavioral disorders versus midazolam.",

The number of anxious children was less during induction of anesthesia in the hypnosis group (T3: 39% vs 68%) (P < 0.05).

    "167": "Withdrawal from chronic treatment with benzodiazepines is associated with increased neuronal excitability leading to anxiety, aversive effects and increased seizure sensitivity. After repeated withdrawal experiences, seizure sensitivity increases while withdrawal-induced anxiety and aversion decrease. We used autoradiographical methods employing [(3)H]Ro48 8587, a selective ligand for glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors, to study withdrawal-induced changes in AMPA receptor binding in areas of the mouse brain postulated to be involved in these responses. Mice were given 21 days treatment with diazepam (15 mg/kg, s.c. in sesame oil) followed by withdrawal (single withdrawal) or three blocks of 7 days treatment interspersed with 3-day periods to allow washout of drug (repeated withdrawal). In keeping with heightened excitability in withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment, the single withdrawal group showed, 72 h after their final dose of diazepam, increased [(3)H]Ro48 8587 binding in several brain areas associated with emotional responses or seizure activity, including hippocampal subfields, amygdalar and thalamic nuclei and motor cortex. In contrast, the repeated withdrawal group showed no changes in [(3)H]Ro48 8587 binding in any brain area studied. These observations are consistent with up-regulation of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission being important in withdrawal-induced anxiety and aversion but not in increased seizure sensitivity associated with repeated withdrawal. As changes in AMPA receptor subunit expression alter the functionality of the receptor, future studies will address this possibility.",

The GABA antagonist picrotoxin and the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin were used to examine the role of GABA and 5-HT2 receptors in psychollatine-induced effects. In the light/dark and hole-board models of anxiety, diazepam (0.75 mg/kg) and psychollatine (7.5 and 15 mg/kg) showed anxiolytic-like effect at doses that do not increase sleeping time nor alter spontaneous locomotor activity. The anxiolytic effect of psychollatine was prevented by prior administration of ritanserin, but not of picrotoxin, indicating that 5-HT2 but not GABA receptors are implicated. In the forced swimming model of depression, psychollatine (3 and 7.5 mg/kg) effects were comparable to the antidepressants imipramine (15 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg). Psychollatine suppressed oxotremorine-induced tremors in all doses. In the step-down learning paradigm, diazepam (0.85 mg/kg), MK-801 (0.15 mg/kg), and psychollatine 100 mg/kg impaired the acquisition of learning and memory consolidation, without interfering with retrieval. It is concluded that the effects of psychollatine at the central nervous system involve serotonergic 5HT2(A/C) receptors.", 
    "169": "The metabolic effect of atypical antipsychotic drugs may manifest itself in weight gain, disturbances in glucose homeostasis and dyslipidemia. One confounding factor is that psychotic disorders themselves make the patients prone to specific metabolic changes. Nevertheless clinical studies have confirmed that atypical anti-psychotic drugs have a different metabolic effect. In the present prospective case-series, four male antipsychotic drug-naive psychiatric patients without any familial history of metabolic disorder were studied. The patients received risperidone or olanzapine monotherapy for 12 weeks; weight, plasma levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, and fasting glucose were measured in every 4th week. In two patients, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was also performed at days 0 and 56. The average weight gain during the 12-week period was 12%. The cholesterol and triglyceride plasma concentrations were also elevated. The fasting glucose levels did not change during the observation period. In the OGTT performed in two patients, normal fasting glucose and insulin plasma levels were observed after 8 weeks; however, the plasma insulin concentrations were highly elevated after glucose intake, which may suggest the presence of insulin resistance. Our preliminary results confirmed the previous results on the metabolic effect of atypical anti-psychotic drugs, which may lead to metabolic syndrome. The regular control of the metabolic laboratory parameters, early intervention and the modification of the atypical antipsychotic treatment may help to avoid this adverse effect of the drugs.", 
    "170": "Gender-specific differences in suicidal behaviour have been analysed in a number of recent studies. According to these, several socioeconomic, demographic, psychiatric, familial, help-seeking differences can be identified in protective and risk factors between males and females. Gender is one of the most replicated predictors for suicide. In the framework of the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour, more than fifty thousand suicide attempts have been registered so far. Until now data on more than 1200 monitored suicidal events have been collected in Pecs centre. In most countries male suicid rates are higher. In contrast to suicides, rates of suicide attempts are usually higher in females. Concerning the differences in methods, it is a recognised fact that males use violent methods of both suicide and attempted suicide more often than females. The summarised clinical impression suggests that compliance of male patients is poorer than that of females. According to our data, a typical male attempter is characterised as follows: unemployed, never married, lives alone. He tends to use violent methods; if he takes drugs, it is mostly meprobamate or carbamazepine. A lot of male attempters have alcohol problems or dependence. As for the females, we found high odds ratios in the following cases: divorced or widowed, economically inactive, depressive state in the anamnesis. Female attempters are mainly repeaters using the method of self-poisoning, mostly with benzodiazepines. As suicide is a multicausal phenomenon, its therapy and prevention should also be complex and gender differences should be taken into account in building up our helping strategies.",

    "172": "A matched case-control design was used to examine California Medicaid beneficiaries. Cases developed diabetes subsequent to being diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD-9295), were 18 years or older, and were exposed to at least one antipsychotic medication at some point during the 12 weeks preceding diabetes diagnosis. Diabetes was defined by diagnostic claim (ICD-9250) or prescription for antidiabetic agents. A total of 3663 cases were matched to 14 523 non-diabetic controls (people with schizophrenia matched on gender and age +/-5 years). All had to be continuously eligible for benefits during the 12-week period preceding diabetes onset in the case. Conditional logistic regression modeled the risk of exposure, controlling for age, ethnicity, and exposure to selected concomitant medications. Analyses were repeated with 24- and 52-week exposure windows.", 
    "173": "Using a 12-week exposure window, olanzapine (OR = 1.36, 95%CI 1.20-1.53), clozapine (OR = 1.34, 95%CI 1.16-1.55), and combination atypical therapy (OR = 1.58, 95%CI 1.33-1.88), but not risperidone or quetiapine, were associated with increased odds of developing diabetes compared to conventional antipsychotics. Changing to a 24-week exposure window, the risks were: olanzapine (OR = 1.38, 95%CI 1.22-1.56), clozapine (OR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.14-1.53), or combinations (OR = 1.54, 95%CI 1.29-1.84). With a 52-week exposure window, the risks were: olanzapine (OR = 1.41, 95%CI 1.24-1.60), clozapine (OR = 1.41, 95%CI 1.21-1.65), combinations (OR = 1.58, 95%CI 1.31-1.90). Risk for olanzapine increased with dose. Hispanic, African American, and unknown ethnicity were significant risks for development of type 2 diabetes as was exposure to selected concomitant medications.",

    "176": "The database for the Prescription Drug Insurance Plan in the province of Quebec was used as the data source for a population-based cohort study. Denominalized data were extracted for all ambulatory patients who first received an atypical antipsychotic between 1 January 1997 and 31 August 1999. Eligible patients were categorized as taking: no antidiabetic medication; no lipid reducing medication; neither type of medication. Those who started to use an outcome drug (an antidiabetic or lipid-lowering medication) before the end of the follow-up period (31 August 2000) were considered to have developed the corresponding outcome disease. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) (and 95% confidence intervals) for initiating antihyperglycemic or lipid-lowering drug treatment, or both were calculated. Outcomes on risperidone were compared to those on olanzapine.",

    "179": "Panic disorder is a common and disabling psychiatric disorder. Despite treatment advances, refractory panic disorder requires novel interventions. One such pharmacologic intervention with theoretical and case study support includes olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine medication currently approved for schizophrenia in the United States. Ten people with refractory DSM-IV diagnosed panic disorder completed an 8-week, open-label, flexible-dose clinical trial. Baseline, in-treatment, and end-of-treatment data for panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, phobic avoidance, and impairment were collected. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Refractory panic disorder patients required a wide dose range averaging 12.3 mg/day of olanzapine to significantly improve or ablate panic attacks. On the average, number of attacks decreased from 6.1/week at baseline to 1.1/week at the end of treatment, and anticipatory anxiety from 32% of the day to 8% of the day. At treatment end, 5 of 10 participants (50%) were panic free, 4 (40%) had one attack in the previous week, 1 (10%) had seven attacks in the previous week, and 6 of 10 participants (60%) were anticipatory anxiety free. There were also statistically and clinically significant improvements in impairment over the course of the trial. There were no significant changes in vital signs, emergent side effects, or average weight, although 6 of 10 people did gain weight. Olanzapine is potentially effective and safe in panic disorder. Due to study limitations, further clinical trials are needed to demonstrate effectiveness.", 
    "180": "The management of mental disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum period confronts the psychiatrist to a complex clinical situation. The cero risk utopia should be changed for a more realistic approach which considers the risks of having a conservative conduct (assuming the consequences of the untreated mental disorders) or making a psychopharmacological intervention knowing the expectable effects on the fetus and the offspring. The antidepressants and the conventional antipsychotics seem to be safe drugs in the first trimester of pregnancy. The benzodiazepines and the mood stabilizers are linked with the appearance of teratogenic malformations after the first trimester exposure. In the present article, the pharmacokinetic peculiarities of the pregnancy and the newborn and the general considerations of the psychopharmacological management of this kind of patients are described. At last, there is a review of the literature about the effects of the different groups of psychiatric drugs on the fetal growth, their passage to maternal milk and their impact on the newborn.", 
    "181": "Using data from the Public Health Service, we studied the demographic and clinical characteristics of 1,782 patients enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) during 2001 in the Swiss Canton of Vaud, comparing our findings with the results of a previous study from 1976 to 1986. In 2001, most patients (76.9%) were treated in general practice. Mortality is low in this MMT population (1%/year). While patient age and sex profiles were similar to those found in the earlier study, we did observe a substantial increase in the number of patients and the number of practitioners treating MMT patients, probably reflecting the low-threshold governmental policies and the creation of specialized centers. In conclusion, easier access to MMT enhances the number of patients, but new concerns about the quality of management emerge: benzodiazepine as a concomitant prescription; low rates of screening for hepatitis B, C and HIV, and social and psychiatric preoccupations.", 
    "182": "Sedation is frequently required in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Sedation and analgesia requirements may vary substantially among patients. This study examined whether psychological factors predict amount of sedation requirements beyond the effects of other biomedical parameters.", 
    "183": "This study used a prospective correlative design in an eight-bed medical intensive care unit at a tertiary university hospital. Fifty-five adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation were included. We evaluated by questionnaires three psychological factors of patients--hostility, anxiety and desire for control (DC)--as completed by patients' relatives at entry to the intensive care unit. Daily doses of sedatives required were monitored. The primary outcome measurement was midazolam dose expressed in mg/kg/h.", 
    "184": "There was a statistically significant correlation between psychological factors and midazolam dose (mg/kg/h): r values = 0.40 for anxiety, 0.43 for hostility, and 0.46 for DC. Age and pulmonary edema were inversely related to midazolam requirements, whereas smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fentanyl dose, and therapeutic intervention scoring system were positively correlated with midazolam doses. In a multiple regression, DC accounted for an additional and significant 5.4% of the variance in midazolam after controlling statistically for the effects of the significant background and biomedical predictors. In the final regression equation, DC and fentanyl were the only significant factors associated with higher sedation requirement.", 
    "185": "Premorbid psychological profile independently predicts sedation requirement in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Early identification of such a profile may help in sedation management and patient care. The possible mechanisms and clinical implications are discussed.", 
    "186": "The complexity of in vitro kinetic phenomena observed for CYP3A4 substrates (homo- or heterotropic cooperativity) confounds the prediction of drug-drug interactions, and an evaluation of alternative and/or pragmatic approaches and substrates is needed. The current study focused on the utility of the three most commonly used CYP3A4 in vitro probes for the prediction of 26 reported in vivo interactions with azole inhibitors (increase in area under the curve ranged from 1.2 to 24, 50% in the range of potent inhibition). In addition to midazolam, testosterone, and nifedipine, quinidine was explored as a more \"pragmatic\" substrate due to its kinetic properties and specificity toward CYP3A4 in comparison with CYP3A5. Ki estimates obtained in human liver microsomes under standardized in vitro conditions for each of the four probes were used to determine the validity of substrate substitution in CYP3A4 drug-drug interaction prediction. Detailed inhibitor-related (microsomal binding, depletion over incubation time) and substrate-related factors (cooperativity, contribution of other metabolic pathways, or renal excretion) were incorporated in the assessment of the interaction potential. All four CYP3A4 probes predicted 69 to 81% of the interactions with azoles within 2-fold of the mean in vivo value. Comparison of simple and multisite mechanistic models and interaction prediction accuracy for each of the in vitro probes indicated that midazolam and quinidine in vitro data provided the best assessment of a potential interaction, with the lowest bias and the highest precision of the prediction. Further investigations with a wider range of inhibitors are required to substantiate these findings.", 
    "187": "A series of 2-semicarbazonomethyl-4,5-methylenedioxyphenylacetic acids (12-19) were synthesized and tested as anticonvulsant agents in DBA/2 mice against sound-induced seizures and the results compared to those previously reported for the corresponding methyl esters (4-11). The new compounds possess anticonvulsant properties lower than those of 4-11, but, in some instances, comparable to that of GYKI 52466, a well-known noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist."
