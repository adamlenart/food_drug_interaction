Antacids influence drug absorption by alteration of ionization state or solubility, factors dependent upon pH. Antacids also delay gastric emptying and are capable of chelation and adsorption with susceptible products. Many of these factors participate to produce the effect on gastrointestinal drug absorption in individual patients.", 
    "1": "The AA. have observed some patients suffering from persistent chronic hepatitis, aggressive chronic hepatitis, severe virus hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic metastasis, cholecystolithiasis, hepatic abscess, congestic heart disorder, alcoholism also patients treated with barbiturics and benzodiazepine, comparising in the meanwhile gamma-glutamyl-transaminase. They would suggest a new interpretation: the observed enzyme was higher in the obstructive diseases, gamma-GT also notable higher in the cellular hepatic diseases (hepatitis, cirrhosis and so on). In their opinion gamma-GT should be a regular enzymatic screening for liver diseases, but should not anyway eliminate the till now used enzymes.", 
    "2": "Effects of MS4101 on emotional behaviour in untamed cats were studied and compared with those of diazepam. Offensive behaviour, i.e., whine response to a rod presented in front of the snout and blowing air on back hair was markedly observed, and whine, attacking and biting responses to tapping with a rod on the back in these cats were marked. Defensive behaviour, i.e., hissing, crouching body, ear flattening to blowing air on back hair, a rod presented and tapping was markedly observed. From 30 min after MS4101 and diazepam in doses of 2 approximately 4 mg/kg i.p., offensive behaviour in untamed cats was depressed. ID50 (50% of inhibition dose) of offensive behaviour for MS4101 and diazepam was 2.40 (1.95 approximately 2.95) mg/kg i.p. and 0.96 (0.69 approximately 1.34) mg/kg i.p., respectively. MS4101 and diazepam in doses of 2 approximately 4 mg/kg i.p. decreased the offensive behaviour. ID50 of defensive behaviour for MS4101 and diazepam was 3.00 (2.46 approximately 3.66) mg/kg i.p. and 1.45 (1.14 approximately 1.84) mg/kg i.p., respectively. Both MS4101 and diazepam exhibited muscle relaxant effects. Here, diazepam was more effective than MS4101. ED50 of muscle relaxant activity for MS4101 and diazepam was 4.30 (3.03 approximately 6.11) mg/kg i.p., 7.40 (5.04 approximately 10.66) mg/kg i.p., respectively. A single administration of MS4101 and of diazepam in doses 2 mg/kg i.p. enhanced food intake.", 
    "3": "The protective effects of pentobarbitone, hydroxydione and diazepam against acute and chronic toxicity of high-pressure oxygen (HPO) were studied in rats. During exposure to hyperbaric oxygen body temperature was measured and ECG as well as EMG tracings from the diaphragm were obtained. Long term observations of animals after the exposure to HPO were conducted. Pentobarbitone and hydroxydione reduced the manifestations of acute toxicity but increased those of chronic toxicity. Diazepam reduced the manifestations of acute toxicity and seemed to counteract those of chronic toxicity. Lowering of body temperature of the animals which occurred during exposure to HPO was probably connected with manifestations of chronic toxicity. Observation of the cardiorespiratory functions suggested a possible connection between their disturbances and an onset of seizures and development of oxygen-induced paralysis.", 
    "4": "The effects of bromazepam (0.1 mg/kg b.w. i.v.) and of placebo on gastric acid secretion related to hypnotically induced anxiety were evaluated in a double blind study, 22 experiments were carried out on 4 healthy volunteers. Drugs were injected after one basal hour. Hypnosis was induced immediately thereafter, and a sequence of anxiety-charged situations out of the subjects past was recalled. After one hour, posthypnotic amnesia was suggested, the subjects awakened and observation continued for another hour. Acid output was measured by means of intragastric titration and a telemetering capsule. During hypnosis and recalling of anxiety in both series, acid output decreased. In the posthypnotic hour there was a significant increase of secretion in the placebo-series, while there was virtually no change in the the bromazepam-series. The pattern of acid output in the placebo-series seems to result from an activation of the sympathetic system under anxiety and a rebound vagal activation in the posthypnotic hour. By contrast, under the sedating effect of bromazepam, no anxiety could be evoked and no rebound vagal activation and thereby no increase of acid secretion resulted.", 
    "5": "A study was made of the interrelationship between the minimal effective doses of pseudoclonic and clonico-tonic convulsions, and also tonic extension caused by the intravenous injection of corazol to mice and the effect of anticonvulsive action of sulazepam and its metabolites (diazepam, desmethyldiazepam and oxadiazepam) on this process. It was shown that all the compounds under study increased the values of the minimal effective doses by the recorded indices of the convulsive seizure, whereas the maximum of the anticonvulsive activity was reached 15 minutes after the sulazepam and oxazepam, and 5 to 30 min after diazepam administration. There proved to be a distinct correlation between the minimal effective doses values of the recorded indices of the confulsive seizure in the control animals which also persisted after the administration of the agents under study. It is supposed that sulazepam and its metabolites increased the minimal effective doses of corazol for the recorded effects, but failed to alter the general picture of the convulsive attack and did not influence the dispersion corazol dose-effect dependence.", 
    "6": "Volume-pulse digital plethysmography performed under ideal conditions on relatively fit adults has shown that lorazepam 4 mg intravenously abolishes the vasoconstriction of fear and restores the digital vasodilatation of the tranquil mind. The sedative effect of the drug is prolonged and is associated with several hours of anterograde amnesia from the time of its administration. The drug has no effect on the vasoconstrictor reaction to cold, pain, noise or other forms of adrenergic stimuli. Lorazepam seems to modify or prevent the psychomotor reactions which may complicate ketamine anaesthesia.", 
    "7": "Eight healthy male subjects received single 2-mg oral doses of lorazepam containing 24 muCi/mg of 2-14C-lorazepam. Multiple venous blood samples were drawn during the first 96 hr after the dose, and all urine and stool were collected for 120 hr after dosing. Concentrations of lorazepam and its metabolites in body fluids were determined by appropriate analytic techniques. Following a lag time, lorazepam was absorbed with an apparent first-order half-life of 15 min. The peak plasma concentration was 16.9 ng/ml, measured in the pooled sample drawn 2 hr after the dose, This corresponded to the time at which clinical effects appeared to be maximal. The apparent elimination half-life of lorazepam was about 12 hr. Biotransformation to a pharmacologically inactive glucuronide metabolite appeared to be the major mechanism of lorazepam clearance. A mean of 88% of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine, and 7% was recovered in stool. Lorazepam glucuronide comprised 86% of urinary reactivity; its renal clearance was 37 ml/min. Other identified metabolites included hydroxylorazepam, a quinazolinone derivative, and a quinazoline carboxylic acid; all of these were quantitatively minor.", 
    "8": "Clonazepam was administered to 4 patients with an unusual form of photosensitive epilepsy. Two showed immediate and sustained clinical and electro-encephalographic (EEG) improvement. One showed immediate but unsustained clinical improvement, but there was no EEG improvement. One patient did not improve either clinically or on EEG.", 
    "9": "Previously acquired continuous avoidance performance of pigs in a shuttle-box was modified by a Pavlovian fear-conditioning procedure. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) given before the Pavlovian conditioning session prevented the increase in corticosteroids and the impairment of performance in the subsequent test session before the presentation of the fear signal. Diazepam given before the Pavlovian conditioning session and/or the test session did not prevent the increase of response to the CS presentation; however, the temporal pattern of increase differed according to the drug condition: the diazepam treatment on the day of the test significantly delayed the peak of responding to the CS; in pigs treated with diazepam on the day of Pavlovian conditioning and with saline on the day of test, the increase of response was diffuse instead of being localized to the CS presentation period. Pigs treated with diazepam both during learning and performance of fear conditioning showed some evidence of performance facilitation. Usual unitary interpretations cannot account for such results which would appear to be the net result of several intermingled effects among which state-dependent learning, acquisition deficit, and performance facilitation seem to be of importance.", 
    "10": "Pigs trained to avoid shocks by crossing a barrier in a shuttle-box according to a continuous avoidance procedure were submitted to a Pavlovian discriminative fear-conditioning procedure in which a tone was always followed by unavoidable shock (CS+) and another tone never followed by shock (CS-). The presentation of the CS+ on a test session in the shuttle-box induced an increase of the response rate while the CS- decreased the performance. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) administered before the test session did not modify the changes in avoidance response to each CS.", 
    "11": "Experiment 1. Gerbils were trained in a T-shaped maze to discriminate the effects produced by pentobarbital (P-barb. 15 mg/kg, i.p.) and the effects of saline. The response, a left or right turn in the maze, was thus contingent upon the prevailing training condition (P-barb. or saline). The criterion of performing 8 correct first trial choices in 10 consecutive sessions was reached within 20 training sessions. Tests with descending doses of P-barb. yielded an ED50 of 9 mg/kg. Tests with phenobarbital (40 mg/kg) or diazepam (2 and 4 mg/kg) solely maintained the drug response. P-barb. discrimination was reversed by megimide (ED50: 8.5-9.6 mg/kg) and metrazol (ED50:24.9-27.9 mg/kg). Thus megimide was approximately 3 times more effective than metrazol. Metrazol (40 and 80 mg/kg) also counteracted the phenobarbital and diazepam response. Picrotoxin (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) was less effective whereas caffeine (100 mg/kg) and piracetam (100-1000 mg/kg) did not upset P-barb. discrimination. Experiment 2. Naive gerbils had to discriminate mixtures of P-barb. (15 mg/kg) plus either 40 or 80 mg/kg of metrazol from saline already at the start of the discriminative training. The drug combinations produced discriminable effects since most gerbils reached the acquisition criterion (8/10), although more slowly than gerbils trained with P-barb, solely. Gerbils trained without a drug s-imulus (saline vs. saline) never attained the criterion during 60 consecutive sessions. In conclusion, reversal of established discrimination (Expt. 1) does not necessarily mean that the same drug combination lacks discriminable effects as demonstrated in Experiment 2.", 
    "12": "11-Demethyltomaymycin, an antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces achromogenes, and its biologically inactive metabolite oxotomaymycin are biosynthesized from L-tyrosine, DL-tryptophan, and L-methionine. The anthranilate part of 11-demethyltomaymycin is derived from tryptophan probably via the kynurenine pathway. The predominant loss of tritium from DL-[5-3H]tryptophan, during its conversion to 11-demethyltomaymycin and oxotomaymycin is interpreted to mean by NIH shift rules, that the main pathway to the 5-methoxy-4-hydroxy anthranilate moiety is through hydroxylation at C-8 prior to hydroxylation at C-7. The methoxy carbon is derived from the S-methyl group of methionine by transfer of an intact methyl group. The ethylideneproline moiety of 11-demethyltomaymycin is biosynthesized from tyrosine, without a 1-carbon unit from methionine. The results of biosynthetic feeding experiments with L-[1-14C, 3- or 5-3H]tyrosine are consistent with a \"meta\" or extradiol cleavage of 6,7-dihydroxycyclodopa as has also been demonstrated previously for anthramycin and lincomycin A. An experiment in which L-[1-14C, Ala-2,3-3H]tyrosine was fed showed that both the beta hydrogens of this amino acids are retained in 11-demethyltomaymycin. It has been demonstrated in cultures and washed cell preparations that 11-demethyltomaymycin is enzymatically converted to oxotomaymycin by an intracellular constitutive enzyme. Conversion of oxotomaymycin to 11-demethyltomaymycin by these same preparations could not be demonstrated. The enzymatic activity associated with the conversion of 11-demethyltomaymycin to oxotomaymycin is not limited to the 11-demethyltomaymycin to oxotomaymycin is not limited to the 11-demethyltomaymycin production phase, since trophophase cells and even cells from 11-demethyltomaymycin nonproducing cultures of S. achromogenes were equally active in converting 11-demethyltomaymycin to oxotomaymycin.", 
    "13": "The effectiveness of repeated pharamacotherapy in acute poisonings with fluostigmine was studied in rats. It was demonstrated, that the second i.p. administration of obidoxime (40 mg/kg) was without effect. Repeated i.p. administration of atropine (10 mg/kg) shown marked efficacy only in animals treated previously with atropine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg). This procedure was without effect in animals treated just after intoxication with atropine (10 mg/kg) or atropine (10 mg/kg) and obidoxime (40 mg/kg). Subsequent administration of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) or caramiphen (10 mg/kg) was without effect.", 
    "14": "The action of 20 mg chlordiazepoxide upon two different anxiety-evoking conditions in comparison with a control condition was investigated in a double-blind, placebo controlled study with 90 healthy male students. The Ss were told to expect an electric shock two times as strong under one condition and five times as strong under the other one in relation to a shock they had previously found unpleasant. During the anticipation interval of 20 min duration HR, GSR, respiration rate, and a rating of subjective emotional arousal were continuously recorded. The greatest effects of stress could be observed within the last 2 min of the anticipation interval, while interactions between drug- and stress-conditions occurred only at the beginning of the 20-min interval. Under the strong stress condition chlordiazepoxide showed an anxiety-reducing effect, under the control condition, however, paradoxical effects.", 
    "15": "Lorazepam attenuated the suppressant effects of punishment on the response rate of rats in the multiple schedule of reinforcement devised by Geller and Seifter (1960). Nortriptiline alone was ineffective on punished responses. Both drugs, at certain dose levels, inhibited the nonpunished response. Combined treatment with the two drugs in a dose ratio of 1:20 attenuated the effects of punishment at all dose levels tested. The effects of the combination upon both punished and nonpunished responding was greater than might be accounted for by a simple additive effect of the individual treatments. Lorazepam and nortriptiline both induced a dose-related decrease in the locomotor activity of rats; when given together the 2 drugs antagonized each other. The results give an experimental support to the clinical observations about the usefulness of the benzodiazepine-antidepressant combination in certain depressive illnesses.", 
    "16": "Some central and peripheral effects of orally administered propranolol (60 mg), diazepam (5 mg) and placebo were compared in normal subjects. The central effects measured were changes in magnitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) and subjective anxiety ratings; the peripheral effects were changes in heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response and hand steadiness. After diazepam there was a decrease in CNV magnitude and in the level of subjective anxiety; there was a slight fall in blood pressure but little change in heart rate. After propranolol, on the other hand, there was no significant change in CNV magnitude or anxiety rating, but a significant fall in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. It is concluded that, at the dosage used, propranolol, unlike diazepam, does not affect the central mechanisms determining CNV magnitude or subjective anxiety. The relationship of this finding to the use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in clinical anxiety states is discussed.", 
    "17": "The effect of 3-hydroxydiazepam (temazepam, 10 mg and 20 mg) on sleep was studied in six healthy adult males using electroencephalography for sleep measures, and analogue scales for subjective assessments of well-being and sleep quality. The effects were compared with diazepam (5 mg and 10 mg). Effect on total sleep time was restricted to the night of ingestion. There was no change in total sleep time after temazepam (10 mg), but with 20 mg total sleep time was increased (P = 0.01). Sleep onset latencies and awakenings were markedly reduced. Temazepam reduced the duration (min) of stage 0 (P = 0.05) and stage 1 (P = 0.01) sleep, and the effect on stage 1 was seen during each two hourly interval of sleep (P = 0.05). No effects were observed with stage 3, 3+4 and REM sleep, except that the appearance of the first REM period was delayed with temazepam (20 mg) (P = 0.001). The subjects, as a group, reported improved sleep, but subjective assessments of well-being were not altered. Correlations were calculated for sleep measures and subjective assessments.", 
    "18": "The effect of diazepam (5 mg and 10 mg), and fosazepam (60 mg and 80 mg), a soluble derivative of diazepam, on sleep was studied in six healthy adult males using electroencephalography for sleep measures, and analogue scales for subjective assessments of well-being and sleep quality. The effect of diazepam was limited to the night of ingestion, but the effect of fosazepam was carried over to the next night and so modified sleep for about 30 h after ingestion. Effects on total sleep time were limited to the night of ingestion. There were increases with diazepam (10 mg) (P = 0.05), and with fosazepam (60 mg and 80 mg) (P = 0.001). For the night of ingestion sleep onset latencies were shortened, and awakenings were reduced by both drugs. The latency to stage 3 was shortened by fosazepam (60 mg and 80 mg) (P = 0.05). The low and high dose of each drug reduced the duration (min) of stage 0 sleep (P = 0.01), but fosazepam also reduced the duration (min) of stage 1 sleep (P = 0.001), and there was an increase in stage 2 sleep (P = 0.01). With fosazepam there were carry over effects to the next night with reduction of stage 1 sleep (P = 0.05). There were no effects on the duration of stage 3, but there was evidence that stage 4 activity was reduced during the recovery night after ingestion of fosazepam (80 mg). No effects were observed on REM sleep. Subjects reported an improved sense of well-being during the day after ingestion of diazepam and fosazepam, and with fosazepam they reported improved sleep. Correlations were calculated for sleep measures and subjective assessments.", 
    "19": "Four rats were maintained at 85% of their pre-experimental body weights and were given daily 1 hr sessions during which they were each placed in a test chamber in which a 45 mg food pellet was delivered regularly every min independently of behavior. During these sessions water spouts were available to the rats and all 4 animals developed high levels of adjunctive drinking, a burst of licking typically following the consumption of each food pellet. This behavior was found to be sensitive to the effects of diazepam and ripazepam. Small doses of both drugs increased the volume of water consumed during a session. The number of licks was not increased to the same extent, however. Larger doses of both drugs resulted in decreased numbers of licks and decreased water intake although licking appeared on several occasions to be more sensitive than water intake to this action of the drugs. A possible explanation of these effects is that the drugs affected the topography of the rats' licking at the water spouts. Whatever the mechanism involved, however, these results suggest that in such experiments measures of both water intake and number of licks should be obtained.", 
    "20": "Droperidol and fentanyl have been used with diazepam in 250 peroral endoscopies because of dissatisfaction with standard methods of sedation. Excellant analgesia has been achieved and complications have been negligible. The technique does not require the presence of an anaesthetist.", 
    "21": "Studies were performed with rats to examine the effects of single, as well as repetitive oral diazepam (DZP) pretreatment on biliary sulfobromophthalein (BSP) excretion rates and on bile flow parameters. One-hour pretreatment of male rats with 150 mg/kg of DZP resulted in about a one-third reduction in the peak biliary excretion rate of BSP (60 mg/kg, iv) and this was associated with a decrease in relative proportions of conjugated BSP in bile. The biliary excretion of preconjugated BSP was unaffected. BSP hepatic uptake and storage were apparently unaffected. In vitro DZP markedly inhibited BSP conjugating activity. In contrast to the above results, when BSP excretion was examined 1 h after the last of five daily oral doses of DZP (150 mg kg-1 day-1), no change in the peak elimination rate of this dye was evident. However, bile flow rates were higher in DZP-treated rats than in controls. When rats were examined 24 h after the last of five daily oral doses of DZP (150 mg/kg), the choleretic response persisted. Further studies showed that the repetitive DZP pretreatment enhanced the bile salt-independent mechanisms of bile formation.", 
    "22": "Diazepam is a valuable drug in cases of acute myocardial infarction. The 10 mg intravenous loading dose and the subsequent 15 mg oral dose of diazepam administered three times daily produced safe, pleasant sedation, and reduced the need for analgesics. A much reduced excretion of catecholamines was recorded. It is presumed that diazepam causes a lower stress reaction, which is beneficial in diminishing the incidence of malignant arrhythmias and preventing the existing myocardial injury from spreading.", 
    "23": "The direct effect of diazepam on skeletal muscle has been examined in 15 patients with neurological lesions resulting in spasticity. Diazepam 15-30 mg. IV reduced the amplitude of the compound action potential of the direct muscle response (M response) and the isometric twitch tension. It is postulated that diazepam may affect the contractile properties of muscle and, possibly, the electrical properties of the muscle membrane. These peripheral effects may contribute to the reported clinical benefits of the drug in patients with spasticity including those patients with complete spinal lesions.", 
    "24": "Rats with chronically implanted venous cannulas were trained to make differential active or passive shock-avoidance responses in a 2-compartment box at 15 sec after i.v. adminstration of pentobarbital (5 mg/kg) or saline. The discriminative pentobarbital stimulus persisted for several min after adminstration. The pentobarbital response also was elicited in tests at 15 sec after i.v. injection of chlordiazepoxide (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) or alcohol (500 mg/kg). Subsequent training at 10 min after i.p. injection of pentobarbital (10 mg/kg), followed by tests after i.p. administration of other drugs, indicated that the discriminative drug stimulus is qualitatively similar with this different route and time interval. A general preference for the passive over the active response developed only in the second stage of training, during i.p. injections.", 
    "25": "The use of Congo Red testing for adequacy of vagotomy in a variety of clinical situations is described. Its intraoperative use is presented for the first time, thus allowing the surgeon immediate documentation of the completeness of his vagotomy and hopefully averting incomplete vagotomy, the single most common cause of ulcer recurrence after vagotomy-pyloroplasty.", 
    "26": "To investigate the effects of diazepam on ventilatroy control, hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses were studied in 8 normal subjects before and after 10 mg of intramuscular diazepam. There was no significant change in either resting minute ventilation or resting end-tidal CO2 tension, but depression of hypoxic ventilatory response was observed 15 (60% of control) and 30 min (53% of control) after diazepam (p less than 0.05). No significant depression of hypercapnic ventilatory response was noted 70 to 130 min after diazepam. In view of the depression of hypoxic ventilatory response by diazepam in normal subjects, adverse responses along these lines should be considered in patients with impaired ventilatory function, such as chronic airways obstruction, and in those encountering acute hypoxemia.", 
    "27": "One year after a gunshot wound in the popliteal fossa, a 30-year-old man began to experience cramps and myokymia in the left gastrocnemius muscle. Myokymia was characterized by vermicular fibrillary movements localized to the gastrocnemius muscle and accompanied by plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the toes. Neurologic examination, nerve conduction velocities, electromyograms, and muscle biopsy findings showed affection of left common peroneal and posterior tibial nerves. The myokymia disappeared during sleep, spinal anesthesia, and treatment with carbamazepine.", 
    "28": "Rhesus monkeys with a history of drinking methadone, but presently drug-free, were injected with low doses of methamphetamine (MA). They immediately developed oral dyskinesias resembling the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia in humans, a condition resulting from chronic blockade of striatal dopamine receptors by neuroleptics. Nine of 11 control monkeys failed to develop dyskinesias during prolonged MA administration. A stressful stimulus intensified the MA-elicited oral dyskinesias, an effect analogous to exacerbation of tardive dyskinesias by emotional stress. Control monkeys were then injected with methadone, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or saline for 45 days. Ten days following this chronic treatment, MA immediately elicted oral dyskinesias in the methadone and chlorpromazine monkeys. Acute administration of the dopaminergic blocking agents chlorpromazine, spiroperidol, and clozapine eliminated MA-elicited dyskinesias, whereas the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine was ineffective. Physostigmine blocked the dyskinesias in 1 of 2 cases. Sedative doses of phenobarbital and diazepam had no effect on oral dyskinesias. These data indicate that chronic treatment with methadone or other dopamine receptor blocking agents leads to receptor supersensitivity to the actions of MA.", 
    "29": "The results of this study suggest that 5-chloro-2-[3-methyl-5-(dimethylamino)methyltriazol-4-yl]benzophenone can undergo N-dealkylation and ring closure in vivo to form the corresponding benzodiazepine. The in vivo conversion was found to occur in mice, rats, and monkeys. A variety of substituted aminobenzophenone compounds were also able to undergo these conversions. The conversions to benzodiazepines were confirmed by a comparison of retention times on a gas chromatograph as well as through the use of a GC-mass spectrometer. The results obtained did not prove that the N-alkylaminobenzophenones were devoid of activity, but they do suggest that their observed pharmacological activity may be due to the formation of the corresponding benzodiazepines.", 
    "30": "Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in ten patients with focal cortical epilepsy. The blood flow was measured by the intra-arterial injection of xenon 133 (133Xe), and the isotope clearance was recorded by a multidetector scintillation camera with 254 detectors. Three patients were studied both during a seizure and (in the same setting) in the interictal period; six patients were studied only in the interictal period, and one patient was studied only during a seizure. Studies during seizures all showed marked flow increases in areas presumed to participate in the seizure activity. This finding accords with earlier studies. All nine patients studied in the interictal phase showed, either spontaneously or during activation by intermittent light, focal flow increases in areas presumed to comprise the epileptic focus. These interictal hyperemic foci probably reflect subictal neuronal hyperactivity in epileptogenic nervous tissue. Only two of the patients had distinct epileptic electroencephalographic foci. It appears that rCBF studies can be a valuable diagnostic tool in the investigation of cortical epileptogenic lesions.", 
    "31": "The efficacy of indomethacin 100 mg, diazepam 10 mg, and placebo in producing sleep, relieving night pain, and reducing the severity of morning stiffness, was compared in 18 patients in hospital with active classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis.There was no statistically significant difference in the preference of patients or sleep score among the three forms of treatment. Both indomethacin and diazepam were more effective than placebo in relieving night pain. Indomethacin decreased, but diazepam increased, morning stiffness in comparison to placebo. Neither active therapy produced significant side-effects.", 
    "32": "A frequent problem confronting the physician - which of two possible treatments to select - is discussed, utilizing a group of neurotically depressed patients with anxiety. In these patients, treated with a phenothiazine (thioridazine) or a benzodiazepine (diazepam), the average severity of crucial symptoms such as depressed mood and ideas of suicide decreased by over 50% and did so during the initial four weeks of treatment, comprising the span of this double-blind study. The severity of many other related related symptoms decreased by almost one-half during that period. The results revealed a moderate but fairly consistent advantage for thioridazine for most symptoms. Details of differential effectiveness, as well as features and problems in the treatment of neurotic depression by the practitioner, are described below.", 
    "33": "The effects of diazepam, flunitrazepam, phenobarbitone and baclofen on excitatory as well as on pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory processes in the cuneate nucleus were studied in decerebrate cats. Afferent presynaptic inhibition in the cuneate nucleus, evoked by volleys in the median nerve, and assessed by the size of the positive cuneate surface potential (P wave), the dorsal column reflex (DCR), and the increased excitability of primary afferent terminals of the ulnar nerve, was markedly enhanced by diazepam (0.1-3.0 mg/kh i.v.) and flunitrazepam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg i.v.), slightly enhanced by lower doses of phenobarbitone (3-20 mg/kg i.v.), but depressed by baclofen (1-10 mg/kg i.v.). Diazepam, flunitrazepam and phenobarbitone also increased postsynaptic inhibition in the cuneate nucleus which was measured by the decrease after conditioning volleys in the median nerve of the short-latency lemniscal response to cuneate stimulation. The GABA receptor blocking agent, picrotoxin, antagonized the effects of diazepam on pre- and postsynaptic inhibition in a surmountable way. After thiosemicarbazide (TSC), an inhibitor of GABA synthesis, both pre- and postsynaptic inhibition were greatly reduced and the augmenting effect of diazepam on both types of inhibition was nearly abolished. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), an inhibitor of GABA degradation, slightly enhanced pre- and postsynaptic inhibition; the effects of diazepam were unaffected by AOAA. Diazepam, flunitrazepam and phenobarbitone did not alter the resting excitability of primary afferent endings or of cuneo-thalamic relay (CTR) cells in the cuneate nucleus. After higher doses (30 mg/kg i.v.) of phenobarbitone pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, which were enhanced by 10 mg/kg of this drug, tended to return to pre-drug values or below. Phenobarbitone, in contrast to benzodiazepines, also depressed in a dose-dependent way the N wave, which is an index of the orthodromic excitation of the CTR cells. Baclofen strongly depressed the cuneate N wave, decreased the excitability of CTR cells, reduced pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, but had no effect on the resting excitability of primary afferent endings. Our findings suggest the following modes of action of the above mentioned drugs: 1. benzodiazepines enhance selectively the GABA-mediated pre- and postsynaptic inhibition in the cuneate nucleus; 2. phenobarbitone slightly enhances pre- and postsynaptic inhibition only in a narrow dose range, and in addition reduces the excitatory processes in the cuneate nucleus; 3. baclofen seems to depress the excitation of cuneate relay cells and interneurones postsynaptically; the depression of relay cells is probably nonspecific.", 
    "34": "The sites of action of benzodiazepines, diazepam and ID-540 [7-chloro-5-(o-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) on the central nervous system were examined and compared with those of pentobarbital using evoked potentials recorded on the limbic system and hypothalamus in the cat brain. Benzodiazepines affected the various neuronal connections of the intra-limbic, limbic-hypothalamic and midbrain-limbic systems; especially the amygdala (AMYG)-, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)- and central gray matter (SGC)-hippocampal (HIPP) evoked potentials were attenuated, whereas the AMYG-VMH, VMH-AMYG and the septum (SP)-VMH evoked potentials were facilitated. Pentobarbital selectively attenuated the SGC-, VMH- and AMYG-HIPP evoked potentials, or facilitated the VMH-AMYG and the SP-HIPP evoked potentials. Both benzodiazepines and pentobarbital affected three afferent hippocampal neuronal connections, areas of the reticulo-hypothalamic systems regulating hippocampal activity, while only benzodiazepines affected the neuronal influence of the amygdaloid and septal areas on the hypothalamus.", 
    "35": "Epilepsy is a common disorder affecting approximately one in every two hundred people, from all walks of life, and presenting in addition to the seizure disorder itself, varying social, psychological and economic problems. A simple classification of epilepsy is described, and the concept of 'seizure threshold' introduced. Having diagnosed epilepsy, the need for investigation to separate the symptomatic epilepsies from idiopathic epilepsy is stressed. Accurate diagnosis of seizure type ensures that optimal therapy can be offered. The various drugs used to control epilepsy are discussed, and comments on the general management of the patient are offered.", 
    "36": "Differential absorbance spectroscopy was successfully used to follow the hydrolysis kinetics of chlordiazepoxide and demoxepam from pH 1 to 11. Loss of the methylamino group from chlordiazepoxide produced demoxepam. Demoxepam degraded by a parallel consecutive reaction to 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone and a glycine derivative. Two intermediates were observed by TLC for demoxepam hydrolysis. One was assigned the open-ring structure resulting from amide hydrolysis, which kinetically appears to be the major mechanistic route leading to the benzophenone product. The other intermediate, representing an alternative but minor pathway, presumably results from initial scission of the azomethine linkage. Protonation of the N-oxide slightly alters the importance of these two pathways. Recyclization of the carboxylic acid intermediate was facile at pH values below the pKa of this intermediate. The stability parameters involving buffer catalysis, ionic strength effects, and temperature dependence of rate constants are reported.", 
    "37": "The effects on subjective aspects of sleep of flurazepam 15 mg and amylobarbitone sodium 100 mg were compared in insomniac patients with chest disease. A double-blind technique was used. The results indicate a significant superiority of flurazepam over the other drug.", 
    "38": "Blood levels and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected for 2 hr after single oral doses of bromazepam (9 mg), diazepam (10 mg), and placebo in 13 male adult volunteers. Both drugs caused an increase in beta activity (above 13 Hz) and a decrease in alpha activity (9 to 11 Hz) in the EEG. Blood levels of 100 ng/ml of diazepam or 50 ng/ml of bromazepam were associated with significant changes in EEG beta activity. Temporal changes in the EEG after administration of diazepam or bromazepam paralleled development of plasma levels of these drugs. Although a weakly significant correlation was found between measurable diazepam blood levels and amount of increased EEG beta activity, the relationship between measurable bromazepam blood levels and the degree of EEG changes was not significant. Quantitative EEG is a sensitive continuous response measure, useful in defining cerebral activity, response latency, and relative potency of psychoactive benzodiazepines.", 
    "39": "In Experiment I, the rat was given 15 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and trained on a black-white discrimination task, motivated by electric shocks; the same animal, when given saline, was treated similarly with the reversed cue relationship on different and usually alternate sessions. Training was continued until a learning criterion under both drug and saline states and then tested with only one of five testing CDP doses (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 25 mg/kg). During training, the rat made more errors under drug than under saline but there were little differences in starting and running times at least during the last sessions. In the transfer test, choice responses showed a bi-directional gradient around the training dose as in stimulus generalization gradient. Experiment II was identical to Experiment I, except that the same drug was tested at all five transfer doses and the resulting transfer gradient was a simple monotonic increasing function of dose levels. Discrepancy between the two experiments was discussed.", 
    "40": "Repeated administration of diazepam leads to remarkable accumulation of N-desmethyldiazepam in white matter structures and in subcortical areas such as thalamus, hypothalamus, and hypophysis. Diazepam and the hydroxylated metabolites were present in lesser amounts. The distribution pattern of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam offers a rationale for its efficacy in inhibiting seizures spreading and for the lack of effect on primary foci discharges.", 
    "41": "The lever-pressing behaviour of three rats was maintained by a schedule in which food reinforcement was obtained by any response which was emitted at least 15 s after the previous response (DRL 15s). When performance on this schedule had stabilised, the animals were presented intermittently with 1-min periods of a white noise stimulus, the termination of which was accompanied by the delivery of a mild electric footshock. This procedure let to reliable increases in response rates furing the stimulus although responding at other times continued to be appropriate to the DRL 15-s schedule. Administration of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (1, 3, 10, 17 and 30 mg/kg) and of ripazepam (1, 3, 10, 30 and 56 mg/kg), a non-benzodiazepine reported to have anxiolytic properties, increased response rates on the DRL baseline while decreasing the acceleration of responding produced by the preshock stimulus. Baseline response rates were also increased by d-amphetamine (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) and at the higher doses this drug completely abolished the accelerated responding during the preshock stimulus. Although the effects of chlordiazepoxide and ripazepam are consistent with the suggestion that these drugs may attenuate the behavioural effects of aversive stimuli, in this experiment the behavioural effects of d-amphetamine were similar in many respects.", 
    "42": "In the light of three case histories, other personal observations and the literature, the clinical and electroencephalographical differences between absences in the limited sense and continuous LENNOX petit-mal state are described and the problems of the latter discussed. As a rule, petit-mal state is diagnosed as such in young people or adults, and practically never before the 10th year of life. In about two thirds of cases, its clinical symptomatology consists of a twilight condition lasting some hours to a few days, coupled with inertia and apathy. The remaining third of the patients usually experience milder disturbances, e.g. in the form of concentration difficulties, tiredness, and (more rarely) severe forms including lethargy. The EEG correlate of a petit-mal state is made up of continuous bilaterally synchronous, frontally marked (less frequently with exclusively frontal localization), usually irregular spike waves or poly-spike waves, which frequently occur in only rudimentary forms and register a frequency of 2 1/2-4 c/sec. For the treatment of petit-mal state, benzodiazepines and in particular clonazepam (Rivotril) (1-2 mg i.v.) are recommended. During the interval condition the same therapy as with an absence epilepsy, e.g. succinimides or dipropylacetate (Depakine) is administered. Anti-grand-mal remedies, especially hydantoins, may trigger petit-mal status.", 
    "43": "Metabolic oxidative profiles of diazepam (I) were obtained by aromatic C-4'-hydroxylation, N-1-demethylation, and 3-hydroxylation using a supernatant of rat liver. Incubation of 3-methyldiazepam (VI), which suppressed 3-hydroxylation, and N-1-nor-3-methyldiazepam (VII), were used to separately investigate these three oxidative pathways. Treatment of animals with phenobarbital enhanced N-1-demethylation and 3-hydroxylation, and to a variable extent C-4'-hydroxylation. Application of metyrapone reduced metabolite formation by 3-hydroxylation and N-1-demethylation, but had no effect on C-4'-hydroxylation. Metyrapone inhibition was more pronounced following than prior to phenobarbital treatment. C-2-hydroxylation was studied using medazepam (XX) incubations. This pathway was increased by phenobarbital pretreatment and reduced by metyrapone inhibition which was again more pronounced following than prior to phenobarbital pretreatment. These results support earlier conclusions on the heterogeneity of liver microsomes and suggests the presence of different species of hepatic microsomal terminal oxidases. Phenobarbital treatment and metyrapone change the metabolic profile via induction and inhibition, respectively, and, thus, in the case of 1,4-benzodiazepines, the formation of metabolites with varying pharmacological activity. This could become important in clinical situations as a diagnostic mean to determine induction under various treatment or, possibly, during cumulation of metabolites with a long half-life.", 
    "44": "Several benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam and flunitrazepam) markedly counteracted the elevation of the homovanillic acid (HVA) content of the rat brain induced by neuroleptics (haloperidol, pimozide, chlorpromazine, and clozapine). A similar effect was obtained with the inhibitor of GABA transaminase, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). The interaction of benzodiazepines with the neuroleptic-induced HVA increase was similar in the striatum and in the limbic forebrain and was antagonized by the GABA receptor-blocking agent, picrotoxin. Both the benzodiazepines used and AOAA potentiated the cataleptic effect of the four neuroleptics. It is concluded that benzodiazepines, by intensifying GABA-ergic transmission, enhance the ongoing inhibition of mesencephalic dopamine neurons exerted by the striatonigral GABA system. As a consequence, the feedback activation of dopamine neurons induced by the neuroleptic blockade of dopamine receptors in the striatum and the limbic system is attenuated. This results in a reduction of the neuroleptic-induced increase of HVA and in the potentiation of the cataleptic effect of neuroleptics.", 
    "45": "During their first exposure to a non-familiar situation, food deprived rats eat only for a short time. During their second exposure, the rats eat for a longer time. Rats treated with benzodiazepines before their first exposure showed no enhanced food intake during the second exposure. This effect did not seem related to an acquired taste aversion but more likely could be explained by an impaired retention of the first experience.", 
    "46": "The effect of intravenous and intramuscular administration of diazepam on secretin- and cholecystokinin-stimulated pancreatic secretion was studied in man. Diazepam was not found to have a significant effect on mean volume out-put, bicarbonate and enzyme concentrations and colour index. It was acceptable as premedication for routine pancreatic function studies.", 
    "47": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) at a dose of 20 mg/kg, i.p. was found to exert a marked disruptive effect on black-white successive discrimination learning in rats, while this effect failed to be obtained on black-gray simultaneous discrimination. Since trials to the learning criterion were found almost equal for saline rats on both successive and simultaneous discrimination tasks, the differential inhibitory effects of CDP could not be accounted for in terms of differences in difficulties of the two tasks. It is suggested that present results might be interpreted in terms of the hypotheses (a) that CDP produces a deficit in the integration of relevant stimulus cues when they were presented across trials or (b) that CDP has a disinhibitory effect in that inhibition of dominant response (positional preference) patterns is weakened by the drug, in a manner similar to effects observed in hippocampectomized animals.", 
    "48": "The neurophysiologic and neuropsychologic effects and their relation to the kinetics of diazepam (DZ) were studied in 10 patients with impaired liver function of various degrees and in three normal subjects after 10 mg DZ i.v. The plasma concentration data were treated according to a two-compartment open model. Neurophysiologic effect measurements were obtained from galvanic skin response, continuous reaction times (CRT), heart rate, and averaged evoked potentials; neuropsychologic measurements were obtained from trail making A + B, hidden pattern, word fluency, and subtraction tests; in addition, clinical effects were rated by Beechers Mood Scale and Spielbergers Anxiety Scale. Except for trail making A and word fluency all tests discriminated well between the experimental conditions with or without diazepam. No difference from normal in the response to acute diazepam administration could be detected in patients with reduced liver function. A linear correlation between prolongation in CRT and DZ log plasma concentration was demonstrated in the entire, heterogenous patient material. In the clinical ratings only items of a predominantly sedative and autonomic significance responded to the diazepam injection, while predominantly anxiolytic items did not.", 
    "49": "Patients with haemorrhage from oesophageal varices associated with portal hypertension are poor risks for anaesthesia and surgery. One method of controlling such haemorrhage is injection of the oesophageal varices (sclero-therapy) via an oesophagoscope. Careful preoperative preparation and use of the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube in combination with the anaesthetic technique of intermittent Althesin and suxamethonium with artificial ventilation with nitrous oxide and oxygen enables sclerotherapy to be carried out successfully.", 
    "50": "Most street hallucinogens contain either LSD or phenycyclidine HCl (PCP). Because the acute phase of LSD and PCP mimic several other drugs and conditions, it is important to exclude these other possibilities. When faced with LSD or PCP, \"talking down\" usually suffices for the mild case; management becomes more complex should hyperpyrexia, coma, seizures or a hypertensive crisis ensue. Diazepam, not a phenothiazine, is preferred for sedation.", 
    "51": "The effects of 10-chloro-11b-(2'-fluorophenyl)-2,3,5,6,7,11b-hexahydro-7-(2''-hydroxyethyl)benzo[6,7]-1,4-diazepino [5,4-b]oxazol-6-one (MS4101), a new benzodiazepine compound, on evoked potential in cats were examined and compared with diazepam. Though evoked potential in somatic cortex I, motor cortex I and posterior groups induced by tibial nerve stimulation were unaffected by a small dose of MS4101 (1 mg/kg) which did not influence on limbic system, the amplitude of evoked potential in midbrain reticular formation was reduced. The amplitude of evoked potential in amygdala and hippocampus induced by cutaneous nerve stimulation was reduced by MS4101 and diazepam. These two drugs had the same effect on amygdala and difference in the degree of action between these drugs was not observed. Sham rage response following head shake, circling and whine behaviour was observed by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus. The threshold of sham rage response by raised by MS4101 and diazepam.", 
    "52": "An 8-year-old child was given perphenazine to prevent vomiting after surgery and developed an acute dystonic reaction; There were features of both tetany and tetanus without any of the classical features of extrapyramidal disturbance. The diagnostic difficulties are discussed. The reaction was treated successfully with i.v. diazepam. The prescribing of anti-emetics after surgery is examined critically with special reference to children.", 
    "53": "In eight patients, following carotid angiography under neuroleptanalgesia, a radiopaque dye was instilled into the pharynx. The chest was x-rayed 15 min later. All eight patients were observed to have aspirated the dye. The technique of neuroleptanalgesia described should not be used without safeguarding the airway in patients liable to regurgitate and inhale gastric contents.", 
    "54": "The interactions between oxazepam and ethanol were investigated in a pharmacopsychological study. The results of the psycho-experimental investigations are reported in this paper. The effects of oxazepam and/or ethanol doses given to 14 subjects with known blood concentrations of the respective substances were monitored and compared to placebo effects. - An analysis of the experiments with respect to the psychomotoric responses showed a tendency towards motoric instability under ethanol (A), whereas in the placebo experiment a relatively constant level of efficiency was maintained. In the oxazepam experiment (C) a slowing of the psychomotoric functions was observed. The concomitant influence of ethanol and oxazepam accentuates the motoric instability with a delay of the motoric responses. These effects remain visible, though slightly modified, after the administration of both substances at intervals (E). The experiments showed a decrease in efficiency during continuous exercise, a delayed response to optic and acoustic stimuli, and a retardation of the entire behavioral pattern under the influence of ethanol and oxazepam. The results indicate the existence of marked interactions between ethanol and oxazepam.", 
    "55": "A method has been developed for gas-chromatographic determination of clonazepam (\"Rivotril\" or \"Ro 5-4023\") in plasma, using methyl-clonazepam (\"Ro 4082\") as an internal standard. Following extraction of the benzodiazepines and hydrolysis, the benzophenones are analyzed by gas-chromatography, using a glass column filled with 3% OV 225 on Gas Chrom Q and a 63Ni electron-capture detector. The technique has good selectivity. The limit of sensitivity is less than 1 ng/ml of plasma. Using this method the plasma kinetics of clonazepam may be studied in man and the correlations between plasma levels and therapeutic activity investigated. It is also available for toxicological analysis, as well as pharmacovigilance purpose. The same internal standard and a similar method can also be used for the determination of flunitrazpem (\"Rohypnol\" or \"Ro 5-4200\") and its major metabolite (N-desmethyl-flunitrazepam) in plasma.", 
    "56": "Treatment with Rivotril in doses of 2-10 mg daily was given to 26 patients with various forms of epilepsy, mostly refractory to previous treatment. In 2 cases the drug was withdrawn on account of intolerance, in 4 cases treatment was stopped after several days in view of greatly increased frequency of seizures. In the remaining cases the drug was administered during 2 to 27 months, (mean 7 months) in 3 cases as the only medication and in 17 with other anticonvulsants. The best therapeutic results were obtained in patients with partial seizures of complex symptomatology and in generalized non-convulsive seizures, the worst results in generalized seizures. Electroencephalographic findings included particularly disappearance of seizure activity, while focal changes persisted and even grew worse in some cases. Apart from 2 cases of acute intolerance in another 4 cases side effects were observed with somnolence, dizziness, equilibrium disturbances, and in one case granulocytopenia developed. Allergic changes and liver or renal damage were never observed. The authors suggest introduction of the drug in treatment of epilepsy in view of its favourable clinical effect even in cases refractory to previous treatment, especially since the drug is relatively well tolerated.", 
    "57": "The ultraviolet absorption spectra of 22 different chemical (structural) groups of drugs and toxic compounds were studied. This paper completes a three-part series in which more than 500 individual compounds have been grouped according to structure as it pertains to characteristics of the ultraviolet absorption scan. Each group has a typical absorption profile with respect to the number of bands between 200 and 340 nm, the intensity of the band(s), and the changes in absorption pattern with solvent and pH changes. Phenothiazines, xanthines, coumarins, quinolines, naphthalene derivatives. O-alkyl benzene derivatives, opiates, ergot alkaloids, benzodiazepines, and various heterocyclic compounds are among the groups of compounds covered in this paper."
