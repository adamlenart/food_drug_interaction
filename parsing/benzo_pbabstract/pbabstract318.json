    "0": "The present study examined the pharmacological actions of four different plant-derived essential oils (rose, ylang-ylang, camomile, orange) in two types of conflict tests using ICR mice. In the Vogel conflict test, in which any drinking behavior of the mice was punished by an electric shock, the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam (DZ), increased the number of electric shocks the mice received. This number increased after administration of rose oil. In contrast, ylang-ylang, camomile, and orange oil did not produce such an effect in this test. In the Geller conflict test where lever-pressing of mice was reinforced by food pellets and then punished by electric shock, response (lever-pressing) rate during the alarm period was increased as well by the positive control drug, DZ. Similarly, the response rate during the alarm period increased after administration of rose oil. Here as well, ylang-ylang, camomile, and orange oils did not produce an anticonflict effect. In the Vogel conflict test, the anticonflict effect of DZ was reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (Ro15-1788) (FL). However, the effect of rose oil in this test was not antagonized by FL. The present study showed that rose oil possesses anticonflict effects, and that the effects are not mediated by the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptor complex. Such pharmacological actions may at least partially account for human behavioral effects attributed to essential oils.", 
    "1": "The role of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor mechanisms in modulating the stimulus effects of the BZ partial inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) are not well understood. The purpose of the present experiments was to assess the role of BZ and non-BZ receptor stimulation in the discriminative stimulus effects of beta-CCE in rats.", 
    "2": "Adult male rats were trained to discriminate either a relatively high dose (10 mg/kg, n = 8) or a relatively low dose (5.0 mg/kg, n = 7) of beta-CCE from saline under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of food presentation.", 
    "3": "Under the high-dose training condition, beta-CCE engendered an increase in responding on the drug-paired lever up to 100% drug-lever responding, with no decrease in response rate. Diazepam, pentobarbital, flumazenil, (+)-amphetamine, and morphine did not share stimulus effects with 10 mg/kg beta-CCE up to doses that suppressed rate of responding. The BZ full inverse agonist dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate also did not engender > or = 80% beta-CCE-lever responding up to doses that suppressed response rate and produced seizures in some animals. The BZ partial inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 and sarmazenil fully reproduced the stimulus effects of beta-CCE. Flumazenil antagonized the effects of beta-CCE with an in vivo apparent pA2 value of 6.1 (slope = -0.86). Under the low-dose condition, beta-CCE engendered an increase in drug-lever responding, with no changes in response rate. In contrast to the high-dose condition, diazepam, pentobarbital, and (+)-amphetamine engendered high levels of beta-CCE-lever responding (up to 77, 96, and 75%, respectively), whereas flumazenil and morphine did not engender full beta-CCE-lever responding.", 
    "4": "These results indicated that the stimulus effects of the high dose of beta-CCE appeared consistent with mediation by the drug's partial inverse agonist effects at BZ receptors. The discriminative stimulus effects of beta-CCE at the lower training dose, however, appeared to be relatively non-specific.", 
    "5": "Previous work has shown that clozapine suppressed tacrine-induced jaw movements at lower doses than those required for suppression of lever pressing.", 
    "6": "The novel atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was assessed in these behavioral tests.", 
    "7": "The effect of acute olanzapine on the suppression of tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements was examined. In order to determine the relative potency of this effect compared with other behavioral effects of olanzapine, suppression of lever pressing also was studied. In a second series of experiments, rats received olanzapine for 14 consecutive days to study the effects of repeated injections of this drug on jaw movements and lever pressing.", 
    "8": "Acute olanzapine administration decreased tacrine-induced jaw movements (ED50: 0.4 mg/kg), and also reduced lever pressing (ED50: 1.12 mg/kg). The ratio of the ED50 for suppression of jaw movements to that for suppression of lever pressing was used as an index of liability to produce extrapyramidal side effects, and the present results demonstrate that olanzapine has a ratio similar to that previously shown for clozapine. In the repeated administration studies, rats were observed on day 13 of drug treatment for the ability of olanzapine to induce jaw movements, and olanzapine failed to induce jaw movements. On day 14, olanzapine reduced tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements (ED50: 1.12 mg/kg). In a separate experiment, olanzapine significantly suppressed lever pressing, and this effect showed sensitization with repeated administration (day 14, ED50: 0.76 mg/kg). Thus, repeated injections of olanzapine reduced tacrine-induced jaw movements in a dose range similar to or slightly higher than that which suppressed lever pressing.", 
    "9": "On tests of jaw-movement activity and lever pressing after both acute and repeated drug administration, olanzapine demonstrated a profile somewhat similar to clozapine, and both of these drugs differ substantially from the typical antipsychotic haloperidol.", 
    "10": "Chronic treatment with benzodiazepines results in tolerance to their sedative and anxiolytic effects and there is considerable evidence that different mechanisms underlie the development of tolerance to different behavioural effects.", 
    "11": "The purpose of the present experiment was to compare the behavioural effects of chronic treatment with diazepam (15 mg/kg per day) given as daily subcutaneous injections or by osmotic minipump. Both regimens resulted in continual receptor occupancy, but the daily injections also provided a period of higher brain concentrations.", 
    "12": "Rats were tested in the holeboard, which provides measures of exploration and locomotor activity, and in the elevated plus-maze and social interaction tests of anxiety. For those in the subcutaneous injection group the tests were 2 h after injection, when brain concentrations were highest.", 
    "13": "Despite a higher brain concentration in the injected group, both groups showed tolerance to diazepam's sedative effects, after 7 days of treatment. In contrast, in the elevated plus-maze, there was tolerance to the anxiolytic effects in the pump group after 14 days, but a persisting anxiolytic effect in the injected group at 14 and 28 days. Whilst higher brain concentrations could explain this result in the plus-maze, they cannot account for the pattern observed in the social interaction test, where the injection group showed a significant anxiogenic effect at 28 days.", 
    "14": "Whereas the mechanism underlying tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam was insensitive to the different treatment regimens, the results suggest that different adaptive mechanisms were triggered in the two tests of anxiety with a differential sensitivity to the treatment regimen. The adaptive mechanism predominating in the social interaction test was favoured by the injection regimen which produced intermittent peak concentrations. This mechanism seems to be an oppositional one, leading to an anxiogenic response, which was manifest despite high brain concentrations of diazepam at the time of testing.", 
    "15": "Olanzapine (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5] benzodiazepine) is a novel antipsychotic agent of the theinobenzodiazepine class developed by Eli Lilly & Co. It has a pleotrophic pharmacology and affects the dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic and adrenergic systems. The therapeutic advantage of recent antipsychotics (so-called atypical antipsychotics) has been attributed to additional serotonergic effects. Clinical studies and trials suggest that olanzapine is comparable or superior to haloperidol and may be superior to risperidone in terms of efficacy and side-effect profiles. The starting dose of olanzapine is a single dose of 10 mg. The drug reaches peak plasma levels in 5-8 h, and has a half-life of about 35 h, depending on metabolism. The recommended maximum dose is 20 mg daily, but higher doses have been employed. Abnormalities of the QTc interval on ECG are unlikely to occur and so there is no need for a baseline ECG as with sertindole, which has recently been withdrawn. The most common side-effects are somnolence and weight gain. About 40% of patients in clinical trials gain weight--especially if they are on a high starting dose and if they were underweight pre-treatment. Reported evidence to date suggests that olanzapine is relatively less likely to produce sexual dysfunction. In general, weight gain and sexual dysfunction are of great concern to people taking antipsychotics and the side-effect profile of any antipsychotic may affect compliance. Olanzapine's general efficacy and side-effect profile suggest that, unforeseen post-marketing complications notwithstanding, olanzapine deserves a major place in the first-line management of psychotic disorders.", 
    "16": "Dimenhydrinate and metoclopramide are inexpensive antiemetic drugs. Metoclopramide, especially, has been studied extensively in the past, but there are no studies that used the combination of both drugs for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).", 
    "17": "120 female inpatients undergoing endonasal surgery were randomised to receive one of four antiemetic regimes: placebo, dimenhydrinate (1 mg x kg-1), metoclopramide (0.3 mg x kg-1), or the combination of both drugs (1 mg x kg-1 + 0.3 mg x kg-1) were administered intravenously after induction of anaesthesia and repeated 6 hours after the first administration. For general anaesthesia a standardised technique including benzodiazepine premedication, propofol, desflurane in N2O/O2 vecuronium and a continuous infusion of remifentanil was used. Postoperative analgesia (diclofenac or metamizole supplemented with piritramide) and antiemetic rescue medication (dolasetron and droperidol) were standardised. Episodes of vomiting, retching, nausea, and the need for additional antiemetics were recorded in the recovery room and 2, 5, 8, and 24 hours after surgery. The main goal of the study was to increase the number of females staying completely free from PONV (Chi 2-test). Furthermore, the severity of PONV was analysed, using a standardised scoring algorithm.", 
    "18": "There were no differences between the two groups with regard to biometric data and distribution of risk factors for developing PONV. In all four groups nearly the similar number of patients stayed completely free from PONV: Placebo: 60.7%, metoclopramide: 66.7%, dimenhydrinate: 64.3%, combination: 64.4% (differences not significant). There was also no difference in the severity of nausea and emetic sequel.", 
    "19": "In females undergoing endonasal surgery under propofol-desflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia the incidence of PONV is about 40%. In this setting, both metoclopramide and dimenhydrinate were ineffective to reduce the incidence and the severity of PONV. The combination of both drugs revealed no additional synergistic effect.", 
    "20": "In 1998 zopiclone had a 42% share of the prescribed hypnotic drug market in Norway. The National Institute of Forensic Toxicology analyses all blood samples from suspected drugged drivers. The rise in zopiclone prescription was partly reflected in an increase in the number of drivers with zopiclone detected in the blood. We looked closer at the test results from 101 drivers with zopiclone detected in their blood in the January 1994 to April 1999 period. 60% had blood concentrations of zopiclone above the concentration observed after intake of therapeutic doses; 80% had higher blood concentrations than those expected 8 hours after intake of therapeutic doses. The majority of the drivers also tested positive for illegal drugs, prescription drugs with abuse potential, or alcohol. This indicates that zopiclone is misused or abused. Therefore the same caution should be applied when prescribing zopiclone as is applied when prescribing e.g. benzodiazepines.", 
    "21": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid(A) receptors (GABARs) are heteromeric proteins composed of multiple subunits. Numerous subunit subtypes are expressed in individual neurons, which assemble in specific preferred GABAR configurations. Little is known, however, about the coordination of subunit expression within individual neurons or the impact this may have on GABAR function. To investigate this, it is necessary to profile quantitatively the expression of multiple subunit mRNAs within individual cells. In this study, single-cell antisense RNA amplification was used to examine the expression of 14 different GABAR subunit mRNAs simultaneously in individual human dentate granule cells (DGCs) harvested during hippocampectomy for intractable epilepsy. alpha4, beta2, and delta-mRNA levels were tightly correlated within individual DGCs, indicating that these subunits are expressed coordinately. Levels of alpha3- and beta2-mRNAs, as well as epsilon- and beta1-mRNAs, also were strongly correlated. No other subunit correlations were identified. Coordinated expression could not be explained by the chromosomal clustering of GABAR genes and was observed in control and epileptic rats as well as in humans, suggesting that it was not species-specific or secondary to epileptogenesis. Benzodiazepine augmentation of GABA-evoked currents also was examined to determine whether levels of subunit mRNA expression correlated with receptor pharmacology. This analysis delineated two distinct cell populations that differed in clonazepam modulation and patterns of alpha-subunit expression. Clonazepam augmentation correlated positively with the relative expression of alpha1- and gamma2-mRNAs and negatively with alpha4- and delta-mRNAs. These data demonstrate that specific GABAR subunit mRNAs exhibit coordinated control of expression in individual DGCs, which has significant impact on inhibitory function.", 
    "22": "Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable and most at risk of suffering adverse drug reactions, which are often caused by inappropriate prescribing practice. Gaining insight into physicians' drug prescribing patterns in order to identify prescribing problems is the fundamental first step in trying to improve the quality of prescribing.",

    "24": "A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in the Norwegian county of More & Romsdal. All patient contacts (n = 16 874) and prescriptions (n = 16 774) issued during two months in general practice were recorded. In defining inappropriate prescriptions, explicit criteria were used.", 
    "25": "Prescriptions (of which 72% were repeat) were issued during two-thirds of all contacts, and 63% were for females. Seventy per cent of all prescriptions were made up by the ten most commonly prescribed therapeutic groups, for which the three most frequent diagnostic indications for prescribing comprised between 47 and 89% of all diagnoses for prescribing each of them. About one in six patients who received a benzodiazepine tranquillizer was concurrently prescribed another benzodiazepine for sleeping problems. In total, 13.5% of all prescriptions met at least one of the criteria listed for pharmacological inappropriateness.", 
    "26": "Inappropriate drug prescriptions for elderly patients are common in general practice. Since the majority of the prescribing practice is made up by rather few diagnoses and drugs, improved practice for only a few may nevertheless have a large impact on the total profile.", 
    "27": "Substitute prescribing has increased in Scotland, as in the rest of the UK. Both GPs and pharmacists are becoming increasingly involved in service provision for drug misusers, but anecdotal evidence has suggested considerable variation in prescribing and dispensing practice.", 
    "28": "We aimed to gain baseline data on (i) current prescribing practice by medical practitioners and drug agencies, (ii) dispensing practice by community pharmacists across Scotland for the management of drug misuse and (iii) variations in practice between health boards.", 
    "29": "A structured questionnaire was posted to all community pharmacies in Scotland (n = 1142), in order to gather information on prescribing from prescriptions held at the time of the survey and information on current dispensing practice in managing drug misusers.", 
    "30": "The response rate was 79%. Sixty-one per cent of pharmacists were currently dispensing drugs for the management of drug misuse. The most frequently prescribed drug was methadone, dispensed by 46% of pharmacists, followed by diazepam (37%), dihydrocodeine (26%) and temazepam (25%). Sixty-five per cent of methadone prescriptions were dispensed daily on request from the prescriber. Of the 3387 people receiving a methadone prescription, 32.9% had to consume their daily dose on the pharmacy premises under a pharmacist's supervision. Nineteen per cent of pharmacies currently provided a service to supervise the consumption of methadone by clients and a further 14% were prepared to but had no current demand. The proportion of prescriptions requiring supervision of methadone consumption varied considerably between health board areas.", 
    "31": "Methadone is the most widely prescribed drug for drug misuse across Scotland, but there is considerable variation between health board areas in how prescribing is managed. Prescribing practice should be revised locally, in a process involving GPs and pharmacists. Pharmacists have an important role in preventing drug misuse in primary care, but need further support to optimize good practice.", 
    "32": "This article reviews the pharmacological treatment of severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients, notably those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury or the sepsis syndrome. Haemodynamic support in hypotensive patients often initially requires aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids or colloids, combined with vasopressors to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion. The catecholamine of choice in severe hypotension with low systemic resistance is norepinephrine (noradrenaline); dopamine is often used in mild hypotension. Once haemodynamic stabilisation is achieved, loop diuretics such as furosemide (frusemide) are used to obtain the lowest volaemia that guarantees adequate perfusion. If the fraction of inspired oxygen necessary to achieve the satisfactory haemoglobin oxygen saturation of 90% approaches 1, a trial of nitric oxide with or without almitrine is justified. Oxygen consumption can be lowered by treating fever with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and physical cooling. Occasionally, deep sedation using a combination of an opioid (most often morphine or fentanyl) and a benzodiazepine (lorazepam or midazolam) is necessary; in the presence of renal or hepatic insufficiency, propofol is a valid, although expensive, alternative. Paralysis with pancuronium or vecuronium has been associated with critical illness polyneuropathy and is used only as a last resort. Corticosteroids may be indicated in the subacute (fibroproliferative) phase of ARDS. Other anti-inflammatory treatments (such as cytokine antagonists, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, antioxidants or monoclonal anti-endotoxin antibodies), as well as surfactant supplementation, have failed to improve prognosis in randomised trials.", 
    "33": "We have examined the pharmacology of kainate receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons (6-8 days in vitro (DIV)) from embryonic rats (E17). Cultured neurons were pre-treated with concanavalin A to remove kainate receptor desensitization and whole-cell voltage clamp electrophysiology employed to record inward currents in response to glutamatergic agonists and antagonists. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) receptor responses were blocked using MK801 (3 microM) and the 2,3-benzodiazepine, LY300168 (GYKI53655, 50 microM), respectively. Inward currents were recorded in hippocampal neurons upon application of kainate and the 2S,4R isomer of 4-methyl glutamic acid (SYM2081) with EC50 values of 3.4 +/- 0.4 microM and 1.6 +/- 0.5 microM, respectively (n = 6 cells). The GluR5 selective agonists, LY339434 (100 microM) and (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butyl-4-isoxazolyl) propionic acid (ATPA) (100 microM), did not evoke detectable inward currents in any cell responding to kainate. LY293558 and the selective GluR5 antagonist, LY382884, had weak antagonist effects on responses evoked by either kainate or (2S,4R)-4-methyl glutamate (IC50 > 300 microM). The quinoxalinedione, 2,3-dihyro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX), blocked both kainate and (2S,4R)-4-methyl glutamate-activated currents at much lower concentrations (IC50 approximately 10 microM). These results provide pharmacological evidence that ion channels comprised of GluR6 kainate receptor subunits mediate kainate receptor responses in hippocampal neurons cultured 6-8 DIV.", 
    "34": "The clinically important antidepressant fluoxetine is established as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This study demonstrates that fluoxetine also interacts with the GABA(A) receptor complex. At concentrations above 10 microM fluoxetine inhibited the binding of both [3H]GABA (IC50 = 2 mM) and [3H]flunitrazepam (IC50 = 132 microM) to the GABA(A) receptor complex in brain cortical membranes. Low fluoxetine concentrations (1 nM) enhanced GABA-stimulated Cl- uptake by a rat cerebral cortical vesicular preparation. At higher concentrations (100 microM and 1 mM), however, fluoxetine inhibited GABA-stimulated Cl- uptake, an effect related to a reduction in Emax. These observations might assist in an explanation of the basis of the antidepressant action of fluoxetine.", 
    "35": "Although it is known that a caloric liquid meal given after food intake delays solid gastric emptying, the effect of a noncaloric liquid is not known. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of normal saline given at 3 hr after feeding on gastric antral motor activity and gastric emptying and to evaluate the role of endogenous cholecystokinin in the changes in gastric function induced by postprandial saline intake in conscious dogs. Two cannulas were implanted in each of five mongrel dogs for infusion of phenolsulfonphthalein into the proximal duodenum and for aspiration of luminal samples from the distal duodenum. Gastric contractile and emptying activity were measured by the force transducer method and a freeze-drying method newly developed by our group, respectively. Postprandial pancreaticobiliary secretion was assessed from amylase and bile acid outputs into the duodenum. One hundred grams of freeze-dried dog food was given as a solid meal after mixing it with 100 ml of normal saline. The dogs were given 100 ml of normal saline per os at 3 hr after feeding. In another study, intravenous administration of devazepide, a specific cholecystokinin-A receptor antagonist, at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/hr was begun 15 min before postprandial saline intake and continued for 1 hr. Gastric antral motility was significantly (P < 0.01) inhibited for 30 min after the dogs had drunk saline at 3 hr after feeding. The mean fractional emptying rate of gastric solids in percentage per 30 min after postprandial saline intake was significantly (P < 0.05) slower than that in the control study without saline intake at 3 hr after feeding. Amylase output into the duodenum after postprandial saline intake showed a gradual increase lasting for about 1 hr, whereas that of bile acid increased transiently but markedly 15 min after saline intake, in comparison with the control study. Pretreatment with devazepide partially ameliorated the suppression of gastric antral motility. Postprandial intake of saline inhibited gastric motor activity and delayed solid gastric emptying, whereas it increased the outputs of amylase and bile acid. Endogenous cholecystokinin may be partially involved in these phenomena caused by saline intake at 3 hr after feeding.",

    "38": "In treated dogs, medetomidine was administered (time, 0 minutes); midazolam and butorphanol were administered when effects of medetomidine were maximal (time, 20), and atipamezole was administered subsequently (time 60). In control dogs, drugs were administered after allowing effects of each agent to be achieved: acepromazine was given at time 0, butorphanol and thiopental were administered at time 35, and halothane was administered from time 45 until 110. Various cardiorespiratory and hematologic variables were measured or calculated.", 
    "39": "Respiratory rate, arterial and venous pH, venous oxygen content, oxygen consumption, and oxygen delivery decreased significantly below baseline values for treated dogs; end-tidal CO2, arterial and venous P(CO)2, and O2 extraction increased significantly above baseline values. Compared with data obtained after anesthesia, arterial HCO3- concentration, venous P(O2) and S(O2), cardiac output, oxygen extraction, and oxygen delivery appeared more modified in treated dogs. Oxygen consumption and physiologic shunt fraction were less modified in treated dogs than control dogs.",

    "41": "This study used high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) and immobilized human serum albumin (HSA) columns to examine the specificity and cross-reactivity of various compounds that have been proposed as markers for the minor binding sites of HSA. These agents included acetyldigitoxin and digitoxin as probes for the digitoxin site, phenol red as a probe for the bilirubin site, and cisor trans-clomiphene as markers for the tamoxifen site. None of these probes showed any significant binding at HSA's indole-benzodiazepine site. However, phenol red did bind at the warfarin-azapropazone site of HSA, and cis/trans-clomiphene gave positive allosteric effects caused by the binding of warfarin to HSA. Digitoxin and acetyldigitoxin were found to bind to a common, unique region on HSA; cis- and trans-clomiphene also appeared to interact at a unique site, although trans-clomiphene displayed additional direct competition with phenol red. From these results it was possible to develop a model that described the general relationship between these binding regions on HSA. This information should be useful in future studies that employ HPAC for characterizing the binding of HSA to other drugs or clinical agents.", 
    "42": "There is no consensus on the choice of drug treatment for refractory generalized convulsive status epilepticus in children. The objective of this meta-analysis of the published literature was to determine the effects of drug treatments on efficacy (seizure cessation) and mortality in children with this condition, controlling for potential confounding factors. One hundred eleven children, treated with diazepam, midazolam, thiopental, pentobarbital, or isoflurane, met strict inclusion criteria. Diazepam was significantly less efficacious than other treatments (P = .006) stratifying for etiology. Overall mortality was 20% in symptomatic cases and 4% in idiopathic cases (P = .038). Mortality was less frequent in midazolam-treated patients (P = .021) stratifying for etiology. Midazolam appears to be a good choice for initial treatment of refractory generalized convulsive status epilepticus in children, but the attribution of differences in efficacy and mortality solely to drug effect is not possible based on the published literature.", 
    "43": "Multiple case series in the literature suggest that benzodiazepines and barbiturates are highly efficacious at stopping seizures. Apparent differences in mortality might not be due solely to drug effect. In this systematic review of the medical literature, we assessed the complications and costs of treatment of refractory status epilepticus in 111 children who met strict inclusion criteria, as part of an effort to provide an evidenced-based recommendation for optimal therapy. All children treated with barbiturates required mechanical ventilation, versus 13% of patients treated with benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine treatment was associated with pressor use in 3.5% of cases, versus 35% with barbiturate treatment. Midazolam treatment was for the shortest duration and allowed the most rapid return to consciousness. Differences in mean 24-hour drug costs were small compared to savings produced by shorter length of treatment and return to consciousness. Benzodiazepines appear to have higher drug costs but lower complications and overall costs than barbiturates.", 
    "44": "Anesthesia providers are unable to objectively evaluate the amnesic status of an anesthetized patient. One purpose of the study was to evaluate the anesthetized patient's ability to process auditory information while receiving an inhalational or intravenous anesthetic regimen. The other purpose was to examine the relationship of the Pa latency of the auditory middle latency response (AMLR) with the stem-word completion test as an intraoperative indicator of implicit memory formation during general anesthesia. One hundred one adults were randomly assigned in a single-blinded design to either a midazolam or sevoflurane anesthetic regimen. Midazolam was administered at 0.540 microgram/kg per minute with fentanyl and 50% nitrous oxide. The other anesthetic regimen was 1.4% end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane with fentanyl and 50% nitrous oxide. A list of 10 words was repeated 16 times. AMLRs were recorded intraoperatively. The difference between the midazolam groups borderlined statistical significance (P = .07) in illustrating that one may potentially process auditory information while anesthetized. Dissimilar findings were found between the sevoflurane groups (P = .77). An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the midazolam group and Pa latency of the AMLR (r = -0.40, P = .047). Multiple regression of the midazolam group demonstrated that the employment status (r2 = .297, P = .005) and the Pa latency (r2 = .238, P = .003) were the best predictors of the postoperative stem-word completion test (F = 12.61, P = .001). In contrast, no correlation was noted in the sevoflurane group (r = 0.43, P = .07). Thus, the continued evaluation of the AMLR as an intraoperative indicator of implicit memory formation is warranted. With the establishment of the AMLR as an indicator of implicit memory formation during general anesthesia, anesthesia providers could then address the occurrences of traumatic neurosis in the postoperative surgical patient and strive to avoid the medicolegal concerns that may face the healthcare team.", 
    "45": "Midazolam is a short-acting agent used for preoperative and conscious sedation. Despite a relatively short half-life, midazolam sedation contributes to postoperative sedation, delays in discharge, and increased costs. Administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, can reverse the centrally mediated effects of midazolam and facilitate patient recovery and discharge, thereby reducing costs. The purpose of this multicenter study was to determine whether flumazenil antagonism of midazolam decreased the length of postoperative stay following intravenous sedation during local and selected regional procedures. A prospective, double-blinded, and randomized convenience sample of 110 adult patients who underwent procedures lasting 90 minutes or less was used. After receiving institutional review board approval and informed consent, patients received up to 150 micrograms of fentanyl and unlimited midazolam titrated intravenously to effect. Flumazenil or a placebo was administered at the conclusion of the surgical procedure. Cognitive scores were assessed by using the Digital Symbol Substitution Test and picture recall, while sedation scores were assessed by using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. The time between the end of the surgical procedure until the patient met discharge criteria in phases I and II was recorded. Statistical analyses revealed no significant difference in age, height, weight, sex, ASA physical status, amount of midazolam and fentanyl received, time for each group to achieve phase I and phase II discharge criteria, or postoperative congnitive scores. The flumazenil group exhibited less amnesia and sedation than the placebo group on initial arrival in the postanesthesia care unit. Discharge times between the groups were not significantly different. Factors such as staffing and institutional discharge policies were identified as determinants of discharge times.", 
    "46": "Isatin, a stress-related biological substance, increases in rat urine in association with elevated catecholamine biosynthesis during stress. The goal of this study was to unravel how the biosynthetic pathway of isatin is related to stress response. The importance of the serotonergic compounds in anxiety, which is the major emotional process of stress response, has emerged. m-Chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), a 5-HT(1A/1B/2A/2C) receptor agonist, and (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride [(+/-)-DOI], a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, both of which have anxiogenic properties, induced a marked increase in 24-hr urinary isatin excretion, whereas neither 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (m-CPBG), a 5-HT3 agonist, nor 2-methyl-5-HT, a 5-HT(3,4) agonist, affected urinary isatin excretion. 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonists such as ketanserin and ritanserin prevented the increase in urinary isatin excretion induced by the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist m-CPP. These findings are the first to provide evidence that pharmacological substances cause increases in urinary isatin excretion via specific 5-HT receptors, probably 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors. In addition, both the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and diazepam prevented the m-CPP-induced increase in urinary isatin excretion. These observations suggest that the mechanism by which m-CPP elicits enhancing effects on urinary isatin excretion has something in common with stress response involving activation of hypothalamic CRF cells and the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "47": "Some of the psychotropic agents widely used for the amelioration of anxiety, depression, and psychosis also show an effect at the cellular proliferation level. Surprisingly little research, however, has been directed to the antitumoral potential of these drugs, alone or in combination with established cancer treatments. Our review of the literature to date has yielded some promising early findings. Ligands active at the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors have been studied the most extensively and were found to have differential, concentration-dependent effects on the growth and proliferation of both normal and cancer cells. Of the phenothiazines tested, chlorpromazine (CPZ) and perphenazine (PPZ) had the most potent cytotoxic action on fibroblasts and glioma cells. Antiproliferative effects also were noted by these and other agents in leukemic and breast cancer cell lines. Additional psychotropic drugs studied include the atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers, especially lithium. Most of the reported activities were observed in in vitro studies and were achieved at high pharmacological concentrations. Further in vivo studies in well-designed animal models are warranted to determine whether these well-tolerated, relatively inexpensive, and widely available drugs or their derivatives may be added in the future to the armamentarium of cancer pharmacotherapy.", 
    "48": "Panic disorder is a prevalent psychiatric condition that often is chronic and rarely resolves without medical intervention. Many patients with panic disorder initially present with a variety of somatic symptoms, including chest pain, nausea, or dizziness, and patients frequently seek care in ambulatory care settings. Although panic disorder is classified as a single entity, it can have many dimensions and may be associated with significant morbidity. During the past 2 decades, there have been significant advances in the treatment of panic disorder, and a range of therapeutic choices is now available. Four classes of medications, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), high-potency benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may be considered for the management of patients with panic disorder. Emerging clinical data favor the SSRIs as first-line treatment for patients with panic disorder, and paroxetine and sertraline have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in panic disorder. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of these treatments, as well as their relative merits and disadvantages, and assists the practicing clinician in choosing among the various pharmacotherapies to tailor therapy to each patient's individual needs.", 
    "49": "To study the possible relation between spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and the derangement of cognitive memory.", 
    "50": "Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult Long-Evans rats by pilocarpine (320 mg/kg, i.p.) and interrupted after 2 h by clonazepam (CZPs mg/kg, i.p.). In addition to the animals that were given pilocarpine and CZP (group P), two groups received ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.): the first group 15 minutes after SE onset (group K15), and the second immediately after the CZP (group K120). Control groups were formed from animals not treated with pilocarpine as well as animals that received pilocarpine but did not develop motor seizures. Spatial cognitive memory was tested in the Morris water maze.", 
    "51": "Testing was impossible for more than 6 days after SE in group P. Ketamine shortened this period for the two groups that received it. During the silent period, deteriorated cognitive memory progressively improved, but the performance of group P started to worsen before the appearance of SRS. Group K120 only expressed a tendency toward declining performance, whereas group K15 never developed SRS, and the behavior of these animals did not differ from that of the controls after the postseizure period was over. Histologically, massive hippocampal cell loss was seen in group P. Ketamine protected hippocampal cells in a time-dependent manner; group K15 did not exhibit any obvious necrosis in the hippocampus.", 
    "52": "There is no close relation between cognitive functions and the appearance of SRS, because ketamine, administered 120 min after the beginning of SE, prevented the derangment of cognitive functions but not the appearance of SRSs.", 
    "53": "Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome with concomittant akinesia and anxiety which both respond almost immediately to benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. The benzodiazepine receptor distribution was therefore investigated in akinetic catatonia with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) using iodine-123-iomazenil ((123) I Iomazenil).", 
    "54": "Ten akinetic catatonic patients, 10 psychiatric controls (similar age, sex, medication, and underlying psychiatric diagnosis but without catatonic syndrome), and 20 healthy controls were investigated with SPECT 2 hours after injection of (123) I Iomazenil. To exclude potential effects of cerebral perfusion (r-CBF) r-CBF was additionally investigated with Tc-99mECD SPECT.", 
    "55": "Catatonic patients showed significantly lower iomazenil binding and altered right-left relations in the left sensorimotor cortex compared with psychiatric (p<0.001) and healthy (p<0.001) controls. In addition, there was significantly lower r-CBF in the right lower prefrontal and parietal cortex in catatonia whereas in the left sensorimotor cortex no differences in r-CBF between groups were found. Catatonic motor and affective symptoms showed significant correlations (p<0.05) with benzodiazepine binding in the left sensorimotor cortex as well as with right parietal r-CBF.", 
    "56": "Reduced iomazenil binding suggests decreased density of GABA-A receptors in the left sensorimotor cortex in akinetic catatonia. In addition to reduced GABA-A receptor density in the left sensorimotor cortex the parietal cortex seems to be involved in pathophysiology of catatonic symptoms. It is concluded that, considering results from correlation analyses, both emotional and motor symptoms in catatonia seem to be closely related to left sensorimotor and right parietal alterations.", 
    "57": "The excitatory input from cortex and/or thalamus to striatum appears to promote the maturation of glutamate receptors on striatal neurons, but the mechanisms by which it does so have been uncertain. To explore the possibility that the excitatory input to striatum might influence glutamate receptor maturation on striatal neurons, at least in part, by its depolarizing effect on striatal neurons, we examined the influence of chronic KCl depolarization on the development of glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxic vulnerability and glutamate receptors in cultured striatal neurons. Dissociated striatal neurons from E17 rat embryos were cultured for 2 weeks in Barrett's medium containing either low (3 mM) or high (25 mM) KCl. The vulnerability of these neurons to NMDA receptor agonists (NMDA and quinolinic acid), non-NMDA receptor agonists (AMPA and KA), and a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (trans-ACPD) was examined by monitoring cell loss 24 h after a 1-h agonist exposure. We found that high-KCl rearing potentiated the cell loss observed with 500 microM NMDA or 250 microM KA and yielded cell loss with 250 microM AMPA that was not evident under low KCl rearing. In contrast, neither QA up to 5 mM nor trans-ACPD had a significant toxic effect in either KCl group. ELISA revealed that chronic high KCl doubled the abundance of NMDA NR2A/B, AMPA GluR2/3, and KA GluR5-7 receptor subunits on cultured striatal neurons and more than doubled AMPA GluR1 and GluR4 subunits, but had no effect on NMDA NR1 subunit levels. These receptor changes may contribute to the potentiation of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity shown by these neurons following chronic high-KCl rearing. Our studies suggest that membrane depolarization produced by corticostriatal and/or thalamostriatal innervation may be required for maturation of glutamate receptors on striatal neurons, and such maturation may be important for expression of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity by striatal neurons. Striatal cultures raised under chronically depolarized conditions may, thus, provide a more appropriate culture model to study the role of NMDA or non-NMDA receptor subtypes in excitotoxicity in striatum.", 
    "58": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and related pervasive developmental disorders constitute risk factors for adult alcohol abuse and antisocial behaviours, including violent offending.", 
    "59": "The present study assessed alcohol responsiveness and hyperemotionality in neonatally 6-OHDA-treated rats, which provides an animal model for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.", 
    "60": "Male Wistar rats were given intracerebroventricular 6-OHDA (100 microg/5 microl) or vehicle (saline-ascorbic acid) on postnatal day 3. In adulthood, we measured motor activity, defensive behaviours and ethanol responsiveness.", 
    "61": "6-OHDA resulted in depletions of brain catecholamine levels. The experimental animals were markedly hyperactive, showed increases in active defensive behaviours (fleeing) and decreases in passive defensive responses (freezing) in response to an sudden auditory signal. In tests for reactivity to the experimenter (i.e. defensiveness to innocuous stimuli), 6-OHDA rats were hyperreactive in comparison to controls. With regard to home cage 6% ethanol and water consumption, there were no differences between experimental and control rats. However, 6-OHDA rats displayed a remarkable resistance to the motor-impairing effect of alcohol (0.5-1.0 g/kg, IP). A similar hyposensitivity to the motor-suppressive effect of diazepam (5.0 mg/kg, IP) was also found.", 
    "62": "The present results show that adult rats exposed to 6-OHDA as neonates are motorically restless, unusually prone to respond defensively to innocuous stimuli, and considerably less sensitive to the intoxicating effects of ethanol and diazepam.", 
    "63": "Despite the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, a significant number of patients show no or only partial remission of symptoms. Some evidence exists to suggest that risperidone augmentation can be helpful in treating this refractory group. The efficacy of other atypical antipsychotic agents, such as olanzapine, in augmenting SSRIs in refractory obsessive-compulsive patients has yet to be systematically investigated.", 
    "64": "A series of 10 patients with DSM-IV obsessive-compulsive disorder showing significant residual symptoms following an adequate SSRI trial (12 weeks) were given open-label olanzapine augmentation for a minimum of an additional 8 weeks. Treatment response was assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale.", 
    "65": "Nine of the 10 patients in this series treated with olanzapine and an SSRI completed the 8-week augmentation trial. Of these, 4 demonstrated a complete remission or major improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, 3 had partial remission, and 2 experienced no benefit. Nine patients experienced minimal adverse effects, primarily sedation, which did not interfere with continuing treatment. One patient discontinued olanzapine owing to excessive sedation.", 
    "66": "The results of this preliminary, open-label trial suggest that olanzapine may be effective in augmenting ongoing SSRI treatment for a portion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder refractory to SSRI treatment. Larger, placebo-controlled trials appear warranted to investigate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine augmentation of SSRI treatment in SSRI-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.", 
    "67": "A retrospective case note study of 93 women was performed in order to assess the effect of maternal factors on neonatal outcome in a group of women attending a specialist clinic for pregnant drug users. There were no significant differences in outcome for chaotic drug users compared with non-chaotic drug users, or for cocaine users compared with non-cocaine using drug users. Women who reduced their methadone dose during pregnancy delivered babies of significantly higher birth weight than those whose methadone dose remained the same or increased (median 3027 g, range 1780-3629 g vs 2645 g, range 580-3720 g). Women who abused benzodiazepines during pregnancy produced babies of significantly lower birth weight than those women who did not use benzodiazepines (median 2100 g, range 580-3520 g vs 2767 g, range 1530-3720 g). The results of this study give healthcare staff evidence to use in encouraging drug-using women to avoid benzodiazepines during pregnancy and to reduce their methadone dosage. The treatment received from a specialist clinic may mitigate against some of the other recognised effects of drug use during pregnancy.", 
    "68": "In humans, interindividual variation in sensitivity to benzodiazepine drugs may correlate with behavioral variation, including vulnerability to disease states such as alcoholism. In the rat, variation in alcohol and benzodiazepine sensitivity has been correlated with an inherited variant of the GABAA alpha 6 receptor. The authors detected a Pro385Ser [1236C > T] amino acid substitution in the human GABAA alpha 6 that may influence alcohol sensitivity. In this pilot study, they evaluated the contribution of this polymorphism to benzodiazepine sensitivity.", 
    "69": "Sensitivity to diazepam was assessed in 51 children of alcoholics by using two eye movement measures: peak saccadic velocity and average smooth pursuit gain. Association analysis was performed with saccadic velocity and smooth pursuit gain as dependent variables and comparing Pro385/Ser385 heterozygotes and Pro385/Pro385 homozygotes.", 
    "70": "The Pro385Ser genotype was associated with less diazepam-induced impairment of saccadic velocity but not with smooth pursuit gain.",

    "72": "This study characterizes the responses to placebo medication of patients with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) who were randomly assigned in controlled treatment trials. Possible predictors of placebo response were also examined.", 
    "73": "Subjects from two randomized controlled trials were pooled. The 101 subjects met defined criteria for severe PMS, remained eligible after 1 month of single-blind placebo lead-in treatment, and were randomly assigned to 3 months of double-blind placebo treatment. Improvement in the current study was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in premenstrual symptom score from the pretreatment baseline.", 
    "74": "At endpoint, 20 (20%) of the placebo-treated subjects showed sustained improvement, 18 of these in at least 3 of the 4 months of placebo medication. Another 42% of subjects partially improved, and 39% were clearly unimproved throughout the study period.", 
    "75": "Some patients with severe PMS experience significant and sustained improvement with placebo medication, but the majority report only partial or no improvement. Patients who sustain improvement for at least 2 consecutive months are likely to remain improved, indicating the importance of nondrug factors in clinical care.", 
    "76": "The effects of pharmacologic depression and stimulation of cerebral activity were investigated in seven healthy young volunteers using blood oxygenation-sensitive MRI at 2.0 T. Dynamic gradient-echo imaging (7 min) was performed before, during and after the intravenous application of 10 mg diazepam and 15 mg metamphetamine as well as of the corresponding drug placebos (isotonic saline) in a brain section covering frontotemporal gray matter, subcortical gray matter structures, and cerebellum. The MRI responses were significantly different for the two drugs applied (p = 0.01). Relative to signal strength during injection, metamphetamine elicited a signal increase of 0.97 +/- 0.03% (mean +/- SD, p = 0.02) within the whole section 4-5 min after injection. Similarly, both placebo conditions led to a small signal increase, i.e. 0.50 +/- 0. 03% (n.s.) for the metamphetamine placebo and 0.40 +/- 0.07% (p = 0. 03) for the diazepam placebo. Diazepam abolished this signal increase. A topographic analysis revealed the metamphetamine-induced signal increase to be more pronounced in subcortical gray matter structures (p = 0.01) and cerebellum (p = 0.02) than in frontotemporal cortical gray matter (p = 0.04). This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that pertinent responses not only reflect global cerebral hemodynamic adjustments, but also localized perfusion changes coupled to alterations in synaptic activity. The occurrence of a placebo response is best explained by expectancy and may provide a confounding factor in the design of functional activation experiments.", 
    "77": "The role of CCK in mediating neuronal activity in the brain in response to dietary carbohydrate was measured by detecting Fos immunoreactivity in response to duodenal glucose load in rats after administration of the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide. In adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats, infusion for 30 min of 545 mg (2.18 kcal) dextrose through a duodenal cannula induced Fos expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), area postrema (AP), lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeAL), and the external subnucleus of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBE). Devazepide treatment (1 mg/kg) attenuated Fos expression in the NTS and AP by 81 and 78%, respectively, but not in the CeAL or LPBE. These results indicate that central neuronal activation is elicited by dietary glucose in the intestinal lumen and that activation of neurons in the NTS and AP is mediated by CCK-A receptors.", 
    "78": "The amobarbital interview has been a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for almost 70 years. Because safer alternatives, namely benzodiazepines, have become available over the past 30 years, its clinical use merits reexamination. Toward this end, the psychiatric literature on the amobarbital interview is reviewed. A Medline search using the key words \"amobarbital interview\" generated papers published in English since 1966. Most of the literature demonstrating utility of the amobarbital interview consists of uncontrolled case series or case reports on a variety of clinical applications. One controlled study in patients with catatonia demonstrated clear superiority of amobarbital over placebo in promoting verbalization and alertness, but six other controlled studies using various doses in heterogeneous patient groups failed to find differences between this drug and placebo. Additional rigorous, controlled studies comparing amobarbital with placebo and with possible alternatives such as benzodiazepines in specific patient populations are needed to define the place of this agent in the psychiatric armamentarium.", 
    "79": "To evaluate the importance of serum anticholinergic activity (SAA) in elderly patients who developed delirium following hospital admission, we performed a cross-sectional study with consecutively referred inpatients in a university geriatric medical ward. Sixty-one patients aged 66 to 95 years (mean age: 79.2+/-11.6; 54% females) were recruited. Delirium was assessed by means of the Confusion Assessment Method, SAA determination, questionnaire for current drug treatment, past medical history and clinical examination, and blood chemistries. Patients were divided into two groups according to the absence (N = 49) or the presence (N = 12) of delirium. Delirious patients showed a significantly higher SAA (23.0 vs 3.9 pmol/mL atropine equivalents, P < .004); they were using antibiotics (P < .05), neuroleptics (P < .002), barbiturates (P < .004), and benzodiazepines (P < .005) more frequently. Subjects with delirium were more likely to have infections and a lower Body Mass Index; they had higher plasma glucose and creatinine. The multivariate analysis identified SAA and use of neuroleptics, and benzodiazepines as the most important features independently associated with delirium. SAA may be a suitable marker for identifying people at risk of developing delirium. Moreover, neuroleptics and benzodiazepines must be carefully used in the elderly because of their relationship with the onset of delirium.", 
    "80": "In the present experiments we have tested the effect of the noncompetitive AMPA antagonist GYKI 52466 (20-80 microM) on spontaneous epileptic discharges developed as the consequence of 4-aminopyridine application in neocortex slices of adult rats. Parallel to the changes of spontaneous activity, the field potentials, evoked by electrical stimulation of the corpus callosum, were also analyzed. Glass microcapillary extracellular recording electrode was positioned in the third layer of the somatosensory cortex slice, while the stimulating electrode was placed at the border of the white and gray matter. 4-aminopyridine and GYKI 52466 were bath-applied. The application of 40 microM GYKI 52466 caused about 40% decrease in the frequency and the amplitude of spontaneous seizures as well as the duration of each discharges developed in 4-amino-pyridine. Pre-incubation with the AMPA antagonist effectively inhibited both the development of seizure activity and the maintenance of the discharges. GYKI 52466 also decreased the duration and amplitude of field responses evoked by stimulation of the corpus callosum. This inhibitory effect was dose-dependent. Our data in the in vitro cortex slice epilepsy model suggest that the non-competitive AMPA antagonist GYKI 52466 is a potent anticonvulsant and neuroprotective compound because it reduced the fully developed epileptic discharges or prevented their development.", 
    "81": "This paper reports modifications in benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors induced by minimally invasive surgery, such as pellet implantation, a widely used surgical process for chronic drug administration. The intrinsic stress induced by this manipulation on BZ receptors was analysed in an autoradiographic saturation study determining the affinity (K(D)) and total number (Bmax) of binding sites of a number of brain areas from the mesencephalon, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The radioligand used for the study was [3H]flunitrazepam, which permitted overall characterization of BZ binding sites. Use of the specific BZ1 agonist zolpidem as an inhibitor of this radioligand permitted the direct characterization of subtype 2 (BZ2) and the indirect characterization of subtype 1 receptor (BZ1). Significant increases in Bmax and K(D) values were observed in pellet-implanted animals with respect to those not implanted. The results support the notion of an up-regulation of these receptors, mainly in BZ1 receptors, following sustained desensitization as a result of the surgical stress induced by pellet implantation.", 
    "82": "Kava-kava (Piper methysticum), a shrub which grows on the islands of the Pacific Ocean, contains the so-called kavapyrones as active substances; these have been pharmacologically investigated in detail and are comparable with the benzodiazepine tranquilizers with regard to their mode and strength of action. The good tolerance and absence of both the soporific effect and risk of dependence should be emphasized. The present article describes the origin and history of the kava plant as well as its pharmacology, action, possibilities for therapeutic use, and significance in medical practice. Also discussed are the advantages of the standardized kavapyrone complex of active substances as a modern phyto-anxiolytic and daily tranquilizer for nervous anxiety, tension, and agitation states.", 
    "83": "Successive negative taste contrast in humans was demonstrated with a common taste stimulus, i.e., cherry-flavored Kool-Aid. A total of 31 male and female college-aged participants rated a 7% sucrose solution which was cherry-flavored as less sweet when it was preceded by a 28% rather than a 7% sucrose solution which was cherry-flavored. Because drugs such as the benzodiazepines affect taste contrast in rats and act as anxiolytics in humans, the present experiment also examined whether several self-reported measures of anxiety were related to taste contrast in humans. Neither scores on Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Survey nor those on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were related to \"sweetness\" ratings or contrast effects.", 
    "84": "The hypnotic and sedative effects of oleamide (CAS 301-02-0) were studied in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of oleamide showed a time-related inhibition of the locomotor activity with the maximum effect appearing 30 min after drug administration. Oleamide, at the dose range of 43.7-700 mg/kg, dose-dependently inhibited the locomotor activity in mice. Oleamide could promote the hypnotic action induced by sodium pentobarbital. The interaction studies showed that oleamide potentiated the inhibitory effect of diazepam (CAS 439-14-5) and antagonized the stimulatory effect of ethanol, methamphetamine, and caffeine, respectively. These results provide further evidence for the hypnotic and sedative effects of oleamide, suggesting a potential therapeutic usefulness of this fatty acid amide.", 
    "85": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate (Glu) receptor antagonists (eg MK-801, ketamine, phencyclidine [PCP]) injure cerebrocortical neurons in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex (PC/RSC). We have proposed that the neurotoxic action of these agents is mediated in part by a complex polysynaptic mechanism involving an interference in GABAergic inhibition resulting in excessive release of acetylcholine (ACh). Previously we have found that the systemic injection of GABAergic agents and alpha2-adrenergic agonists can block this neurotoxicity. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that NMDA antagonists trigger release of ACh in PC/RSC and that this action of NMDA antagonists is suppressed by GABAergic agents or alpha2-adrenergic agonists. The effect of MK-801 and ketamine on PC/RSC ACh output (and the ability of pentobarbital, diazepam and clonidine to modify MK-801-induced ACh release) was studied in adult female rats using in vivo microdialysis. Both MK-801 and ketamine caused a significant rise in PC/RSC ACh output compared to basal levels. Pentobarbital, diazepam and clonidine suppressed MK-801's effect on ACh release. Exploratory studies indicated that the site of action of these agents was outside of the PC/RSC. The microdialysis results are consistent with several aspects of the circuitry proposed to mediate the neurotoxic action of NMDA antagonists.", 
    "86": "We evaluated the combination of diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and dexamethasone delivered as a continuous i.v. infusion via an ambulatory infusion pump with patient-activated intermittent dosing (BAD pump) for prevention of acute and delayed nausea/vomiting in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) for peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization (MOB) or prior to autologous PBPC rescue. The BAD pump was titrated to patient response and tolerance, and continued until the patient could tolerate oral anti-emetics. Forty-four patients utilized the BAD pump during 66 chemotherapy courses, 34 (52%) for MOB and 32 (48%) for HDC with autologous PBPC rescue. The median number of days on the BAD pump during MOB and HDC was 3 (1-6) and 9 (2-19) days, respectively. Complete overall or complete emesis control occurred on 94% of MOB and 89% of HDC treatment days during chemotherapy administration and 72% and 43%, respectively, following chemotherapy administration. Eighty-three percent of MOB and 55% of HDC treatment days were associated with no nausea. While on the BAD pump, no patient experienced severe toxicity or required hospitalization for management of nausea/vomiting. The BAD pump was safe and effective in minimizing nausea and vomiting associated with HDC, and thus, eliminated the need for hospitalization for management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.", 
    "87": "We investigated the effect of psychological stress on lipid peroxidation activity in the mouse brain, the mechanism underlying the psychological stress-induced change in the activity, and the effects of anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs on the activity in psychologically-stressed animals. Psychological stress exposure using a communication box paradigm for 2-16 h significantly increased the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), an index of lipid peroxidation activity, in the brain, and the effect was maximal after peaked by a 4-h stress exposure. In the animals stressed for over 4 h, the increased brain TBARS content lasted for 30 min after the stress exposure, while no significant increase of the TBARS content was observed in the liver or serum. Trolox (67.6 mg/kg, i.p.), an antioxidant drug, but not monoamine oxidase inhibitors, clorgyline (2.5-5 mg/kg, i.p.) or 5-(4-benzylphenyl)-3-(2-cyanoethyl)-(3H)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-o ne (1-5 mg/kg, i.p.), significantly suppressed the effect of psychological stress. The non-selective nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10-100 mg/kg, i.p.) and the selective neuronal NOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p.), but not the inducible NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (1-100 mg/kg, i.p.), dose dependently suppressed the psychological stress-induced enhancement of lipid peroxidation in the brain. L-Arginine (300 mg/kg, i.p.), a substrate of NOS, antagonized the effect of L-NAME. Measurements of NO metabolites revealed a significant increase of NO production in the brains of stressed mice. The benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor agonist diazepam (0.05-0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists (+/-)-8-hydroxy-di-propylaminotetralin and buspirone (0.1-1 mg/kg, i. p.), but not the 5-HT(3) receptor agonist MDL72222, dose-dependently suppressed the psychological stress-induced enhancement of brain lipid peroxidation. In contrast, the administration of anxiogenic drugs, FG7142 (an inverse BZD agonist: 1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (a mixed 5-HT(2A/2B/2C) agonist: 0.1-1 mg/kg, i.p.), potentiated it. The effects of diazepam and FG7142 were abolished by the BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p.). These results indicate that psychological stress causes oxidative damage to the brain lipid via enhancing constitutive NOS-mediated production of NO, and that drugs with a BZD or 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist profile have a protective effect on oxidative brain membrane damage induced by psychological stress.", 
    "88": "The behavioral responses of five mouse strains (inbred: C57 and BALB/c; outbred: Swiss, ICR and HS/Ibg) to alprazolam was examined in the staircase test, an animal model sensitive to benzodiazepines (BZs). Alprazolam administration resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of rearing behavior, but to a different extent among the strains. By contrast, the number of stairs ascended was not suppressed by alprazolam at doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, except in the C57 mice. The addition of flumazenil antagonized the alprazolam effect on rearing and climbing in all strains. There was a consistency within strains in sensitivity to alprazolam, with some strains being highly sensitive (C57 and HS) or less sensitive (Swiss, ICR and BALB/c) with regard to both rearing and climbing behaviors. Serum alprazolam levels did not differ significantly among the strains. This strain-dependent pattern of response to alprazolam seems to indicate a genetic component, rather than pharmacokinetic, in the behavior sensitivity to the BZ, with a spectrum of degree of responsivity among strains.", 
    "89": "The glutamate-mediated synaptic responses of neocortical pyramidal cell to fast-spiking interneuron (pyramidal-FS) connections were studied by performing paired recordings at 30-33 degrees C in acute slices of 14- to 35-day-old rats (n = 39). Postsynaptic fast-spiking (FS) cells were recorded in whole cell configuration with a patch pipette, and presynaptic pyramidal cells were impaled with sharp intracellular electrodes. At a holding potential of -72 mV (near the resting membrane potential), unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) had a mean amplitude of 2.1 +/- 1.3 mV and a mean width at half-amplitude of 10.5 +/- 3.7 ms (n = 18). Bath application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D(-)2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-AP5) had minor effects on both the amplitude and the duration of unitary EPSPs, whereas the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) almost completely blocked the synaptic responses. In voltage-clamp mode, the selective antagonist of AMPA receptors 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3, 4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53655; 40-66 microM) blocked 96 +/- 1.9% of D-AP5-insensitive unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), confirming the predominance of AMPA receptors, as opposed to kainate receptors, at pyramidal-FS connections (n = 3). Unitary EPSCs mediated by AMPA receptors had fast rise times (0.29 +/- 0.04 ms) and amplitude-weighted decay time constants (2 +/- 0.8 ms; n = 16). In the presence of intracellular spermine, these currents showed the characteristic rectifying current-voltage (I-V) curve of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. A slower component mediated by NMDA receptors was observed when unitary synaptic currents were recorded at a membrane potential more positive than -50 mV. In response to short trains of moderately high-frequency (67 Hz) presynaptic action potentials, we observed only a limited temporal summation of unitary EPSPs, probably because of the rapid kinetics of AMPA receptors and the absence of NMDA component in these subthreshold synaptic responses. By combining paired recordings with extracellular stimulations (n = 11), we demonstrated that EPSPs elicited by two different inputs were summed linearly by FS interneurons at membrane potentials below the action potential threshold. We estimated that, in our in vitro recording conditions, 8 +/- 5 pyramidal cells (n = 18) should be activated simultaneously to make FS interneurons fire an action potential from -72 mV. The low level of temporal summation and the linear summation of excitatory inputs in FS cells favor the role of coincidence detectors of these interneurons in neocortical circuits.",

    "91": "Fifteen patients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for major depression were investigated with the specific dopamine D2 receptor antagonist [123I]iodobenzamide (IBZM). Two single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations were performed before and after 6 weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI). Striatal D2 receptor binding was calculated and normalized to the cerebellum. In a non-psychiatric control group (n = 17), which was investigated once with [123I]IBZM and SPECT, striatal IBZM binding decreased significantly with age (0.092 per decade). The age-dependent correlation was lower in subjects with major depression and did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference in mean IBZM binding between depressives and control subjects. Age-corrected baseline IBZM binding in the striatum was significantly lower in treatment responders than in depressed non-responders and control subjects. Furthermore, in the depressive group there was a significant linear correlation between treatment response and change of D2 receptor binding during treatment in the basal ganglia. IBZM binding increased in treatment responders and decreased in non-responders. In accordance with animal studies, the results suggest an association between changes in the dopaminergic system and treatment response in major depression.", 
    "92": "In vivo studies of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy with atypical antipsychotics have suggested good clinical efficacy at occupancy rates less than those observed with typical neuroleptics, and few extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), possibly even at high levels of D2 occupancy. We used [123I]IBZM-SPECT to investigate striatal D2 receptor occupancy in 10 schizophrenic patients who were treated with both a low (5 mg) and a high dose (20 mg) of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine without concomitant medications. The mean D2 occupancy at 5 mg was 59.8% (range 33-81%); the mean D2 occupancy at 20 mg was 82.8% (range 56-97%). Although the D2 occupancy rates on 5 and 20 mg olanzapine were significantly different (P < 0.001), there were no significant differences in clinical ratings for psychiatric symptoms or extrapyramidal side effects between the two doses of olanzapine. These data suggest that: (1) olanzapine doses below those used routinely occupy D2 receptors at levels approaching those associated with therapeutic response; (2) higher doses produce relatively high levels of D2 occupancy rates; and (3) EPS are mild even at relatively high levels of D2 occupancy.", 
    "93": "There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PTBRs) and their endogenous ligands are implicated in the pathogenesis of end-organ failure in chronic liver disease. Portal-systemic encephalopathy, a major neuropsychiatric complication associated with chronic liver disease, results in activation of brain PTBR and probably in peripheral organs. In order to address these issues, PTBR mRNA was measured using semi-quantitative RT-PCR in extracts of cerebral cortex, kidney and testis of rats four weeks after end-to-side portacaval anastomosis and sham-operation (controls). Densities of PTBR sites were measured concomitantly by in vitro receptor binding using the selective PTBR ligand [3H]PK11195. Portacaval shunting resulted in a 2 to 3-fold increase in expression of PTBR in brain and kidney and a 37% reduction in expression in testis. Densities of [3H]PK11195 sites changed in parallel with the alterations of gene expression. These findings suggest that selective alterations of PTBR expression are implicated in the pathogenesis of peripheral tissue hypertrophy (kidney) and/or atrophy (testis) which accompanies portal-systemic shunting in chronic liver failure. In brain, activation of PTBR could result in an increase in the production of neurosteroids with potent inhibitory action in the CNS, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of portal-systemic encephalopathy.", 
    "94": "There is paucity of published data regarding controlled trials with risperidone and olanzapine in elderly psychotic patients. Medical records of 151 hospitalized geropsychiatric patients (risperidone patients n = 114 and olanzapine patients n = 37) were analyzed for demographic data, target symptoms, doses, effects, side effects, comorbid medical conditions and concurrent medications. The mean age of the patients was 71 years. The male: female ratio was essentially the same for both groups. The mean daily dose was 3 mg for risperidone and 10 mg for olanzapine. 78% of the risperidone group and 75% of the olanzapine group appear to have responded to treatment. The discontinuation rates of medication was the same in both groups (22%). Adverse events were reported in 16-17% in both groups. It appears from this study that both risperidone and olanzapine are relatively safe and effective in geropsychiatric patients with comorbid medical illnesses. Controlled studies and head-to-head comparison studies are recommended.", 
    "95": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of hormonal changes during pregnancy and lactation on the expression of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in platelet membranes. Platelet peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding characteristics, Hamilton anxiety and depression rating Scores, and progesterone and prolactin (PRL) levels were evaluated during pregnancy and lactation in 17 pregnant women [first (n = 9) and third (n = 8) trimesters], 10 lactating women, and 8 nonpregnant women. A significant decrease (38-41%) in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density was observed in women during the third trimester of pregnancy when compared to nonpregnant controls and women in their first trimester of pregnancy. The decrease is peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was parallel to the peak in progesterone and PRL secretion. The reduction in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor expression is hormone-dependent and may play a regulatory role geared to prevent pregnancy-related overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, and hypothalamic-PRL axes.",

MM produced relatively large cardiovascular changes such as bradycardia, hypertension, a decrease in cardiac output and vasoconstriction. AB produced moderate cardiovascular changes. Hypotension was observed within 5 min after administration and the mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 30% at 20 min after administration.

The majority of samples were blood and had been primarily obtained from males. Drugs were detected in 68 and 90% of blood and urine samples, respectively. Toxicological analyses revealed that cannabis was the most frequently encountered illegal drug which was detected in 39% of all drug positive blood samples. Benzodiazepines were detected in the majority of drug positive samples with 82% containing at least one member of this group. Polydrug use was prevalent, with the average number of drugs detected per sample increasing from 2.0 in 1995 to 3.1 in 1998. For comparison, the results of toxicological analyses from 151 fatally injured drivers are described. Although the majority of samples tested negative for the presence of drugs and alcohol, drugs were found to be present in 19% and alcohol was detected in 33%.

The results showed that the piloerection changed with age. Pharmacological studies showed that the piloerection was inhibited by an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, but, surprisingly, was not inhibited by anxiolytic diazepam. These findings strongly suggest that the neuronal system of piloerection is different from that of freezing behavior, and that the neuronal system of piloerection develops with age.",

This drug, which has a unique mechanism of action among marketed anticonvulsant agents, has been launched for add-on treatment of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients >12 years of age. Using this new agent as a benchmark, we have designed two series of novel GABA uptake inhibitors of remarkable potency, using a putative new model of ligand interaction at the GABA transporter type 1 (GAT-1) uptake site. This model involves the postulated interaction of an electronegative region in the GABA uptake inhibitor with a positively charged domain in the protein structure of the GAT-1 site. These two novel series of anticonvulsant agents contain diaryloxime or diarylvinyl ether functionalities linked to cyclic amino acid moieties and were derived utilizing the new model, via a series of design steps from the known 4,4-diarylbutenyl GABA uptake inhibitors. The new compounds are potent inhibitors of [(3)H]-GABA uptake in rat brain synaptosomes in vitro, and their antiepileptic potential was demonstrated in vivo by their ability to protect against seizures induced by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist methyl 4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) in mice. From structure-activity studies of these new GABA uptake inhibitors, we have shown that insertion of an ether oxygen in conjugation with the double bond in tiagabine (K(i) = 67 nM) improves in vitro potency by 5-fold to 14 nM.",

    "112": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is characterized by behavioral or cognitive change from baseline for at least 30 minutes with EEG evidence of seizures. Categorized into complex partial status epilepticus (with lateralized seizures), and generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (bilateral diffuse synchronous seizures), there is debate regarding the diagnosis and morbidity of NCSE. Because EEG is needed for diagnosis, only a high index of suspicion leads to a request for the study, whereas EEG is often unavailable after hours or on weekends. Furthermore, the cognitive changes during NCSE are often incorrectly ascribed to a postictal state, intoxication, psychogenic or psychotic states, and mental retardation. Regarding categorization, present classifications address EEG features but fail to distinguish among depths of coma. Deeply comatose patients (with coma etiologies that themselves carry poor prognoses) are mixed with lightly obtunded patients with no morbidity, confusing the prognosis. Thus, a classification that subsumes depth of coma, and possibly etiology, is sorely warranted. Regarding treatment, comatose NCSE patients treated with benzodiazepines may worsen, whereas generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus patients may suffer iatrogenically from aggressive treatment (hypotension and respiratory depression) necessitating balancing the potential neurologic morbidity of NCSE against the possible morbidity of IV antiepileptic drugs. A high index of suspicion is needed to initiate EEG studies. Better stratification of level of consciousness will be needed to distinguish among morbidity due to underlying conditions, treatment, and the effects of status epilepticus, proper.", 
    "113": "The calculated fraction of receptor ligands available for blood-brain barrier passage in vivo (f(avail)) may differ from in vitro (f(eq)) measurements. This study evaluates the protein-ligand interaction for iomazenil and flumazenil in rats by comparing f(eq) and f(avail). Repeated measurements of blood-brain barrier permeability for two benzodiazepine antagonists were performed in 44 rats by the double-indicator technique. Cerebral blood flow was measured by intracarotid Xe-injection. The apparent permeability-surface product (PSapp) was measured while CBF or bolus composition was changed. Comparison of PSapp obtained in the absence and presence of 5% albumin in the injectate yielded f(avail), whereas f(eq) was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Iomazenil and flumazenil f(avail) was 62% and 82%, respectively, whereas f(eq) was significantly lower, 42% and 61%. The PSapp for iomazenil and flumazenil increased significantly by 89% and 161% after relative CBF increases of 259% and 201%, respectively. The results demonstrate that application of f(eq) in neuroreceptor studies underestimates the plasma input function to the brain. Model simulations render possible that the differences between f(avail) and f(eq) as well as the effect of CBF on PSapp can be caused by capillary heterogeneity.", 
    "114": "In vitro and in vivo parameters of flumazenil (FMZ) binding were measured in spiking and nonspiking neocortex identified by intraoperative electrocorticography in epileptic patients who underwent cortical resection for seizure control. In vitro measures of receptor affinity (K(D)), number (Bmax) and laminar distribution for [3H]-FMZ binding in the epileptic focus (n = 38) were compared to nonspiking cortex from a subgroup of the patients (n = 12) and to tissue obtained from trauma patients (n = 5). The in vitro binding parameters were compared to in vivo [11C]-FMZ binding measured with positron emission tomography (PET) (n = 19). The Bmax was higher in the 38 spiking tissues as compared to the 12 nonspiking tissues (P = .012). Paired comparison of spiking versus nonspiking binding in the 12 patients from whom nonspiking tissue was available showed increases in both K(D) (P = .037) and Bmax (P = .0047) in spiking cortex. A positive correlation was found between K(D) and Bmax values for 38 patients (r = 0.55, P < .0001), the magnitude of the K(D) increase being twice that of the Bmax increase. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the asymmetry indices of the in vivo FMZ binding on PET and in vitro K(D) of spiking cortex (n = 19, r = 0.52, P = .02). The laminar distribution of [3H]-FMZ showed increased FMZ binding in cortical layers V-VI in spiking cortex compared to nonspiking and control cortex. The increased receptor number in spiking cortical layers V-VI may be a compensatory mechanism to decreased GABAergic input. The increased Bmax in spiking cortex was accompanied by a larger decrease in the affinity of FMZ for the receptor suggesting that decreased FMZ binding in the epileptic focus measured with PET is due to a decrease in the affinity of the tracer for the receptor.", 
    "115": "Epididymal sperm motion in rats was characterized by computer-aided sperm motion analysis (CASA) with its correlation to testicular lesions in the 2-week treatment study, using three compounds which are known to affect different stages of germ cells. Mature male rats were treated daily for 2 weeks with alpha-chlorohydrin (alpha-CH, 5 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (CP, 20 mg/kg) or nitrazepam (NZ, 20, 40, 60 mg/kg). Changes in sperm motion were detected only in the alpha-CH and 60-mg/kg NZ-treated groups. Of the sperm motion parameters, velocity and amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) were concomitantly reduced in these two groups with good correlation. With respect to the distribution of the values in parameters, however, alpha-CH shifted the values down within a small range with high percentages of motile sperm, while NZ distributed them over a wide range with low percentages of motile sperm. CP treatment showed no histopathological changes in advanced germ cells, though it showed a decrease in the number of early germ cells. NZ treatment affected round and elongating spermatids (approximately step 14) at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg, and affected also more advanced spermatids (approximately step 19) at the dose of 60 mg/kg. alpha-CH treatment did not affect testicular histopathology. These findings indicate that 60-mg/kg NZ treatment reduced sperm motion as a result of lesions affected in elongated spermatids and alpha-CH reduced it by direct effects on epididymal spermatozoa. The present study indicates that in addition to percentage of motile sperm, the velocity and ALH can be useful to detect the changes in sperm motion caused by different actions of NZ and alpha-CH, though each compound showed a distinct distribution pattern of these parameters.",

In this paper we focus our attention on benzodiazepines. The retention of benzodiazepines using different concentrations of Brij35 as micellar mobile phase in modified C(18) stationary phase was studied.

    "117": "The enthalpic relaxation of three amorphous benzodiazepines, diazepam, temazepam and triazolam was studied using differential scanning calorimetry for ageing temperatures which were below the glass transition temperature, and ageing times up to 16 h. Experimental determination of the relaxation enthalpy and the heat capacity change, both accompanying the glass transition, enabled us to calculate the extent of relaxation of the amorphous drugs at specific ageing conditions. Fitting of the relaxation function to the Williams-Watts two parameter decay function led to calculation of the mean relaxation time constant tau and the molecular relaxation time distribution parameter beta. The mean relaxation time constants for the three drugs increased from approximately ten h at the glass transition temperature with more than eight orders of magnitude at 66 K below the glass transition temperature. It was found that the benzodiazepines exhibited significant molecular mobility until approximately 50 K below the glass transition temperature; below this temperature molecular mobility becomes unimportant with respect to the shelf life stability. Hence the presented procedure provides the formulation scientist with a tool to set storage conditions for amorphous drugs and glassy pharmaceutical products.", 
    "118": "In recent years, we have been pursuing our mapping investigations of the substrate for brain-stimulation reward in regions of the anterior hypothalamic and lateral preoptic areas. However, one problem is that stimulation of these sites often generates overt seizures so that their suppression via a pharmacological means would be very useful. The sedative-hypnotic benzodiazepine, brotizolam, is reportedly a long-lasting anticonvulsant. Hence, its effects on motor seizures elicited from stimulation of the lateral preoptic area were evaluated in the first experiment. Both tested doses (5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg) of the drug were shown to significantly decrease the number, and marginally, the severity of stimulation-induced seizures; furthermore, this effect was relatively long lasting, up to about 3 h. The higher dose of brotizolam did not alter the single-pulse thresholds for self-stimulation, a requirement for evaluations of poststimulation excitability, the purpose of the second experiment. Here, our interest was in documenting whether the membrane properties of the stimulated neurons, as assessed by refractory periods, were altered by brotizolam. No differences in the time course of recovery were observed; refractoriness began between 0.4 and 0.8 ms, and reached 50% recovery by 2.0 ms, which is consistent with the pattern of poststimulation excitability typically measured at these sites. Thus, in addition to its long-lasting suppression of motor seizures in rats, brotizolam does not alter the time course of recovery from refractoriness of the neurons that mediate brain-stimulation reward in the lateral preoptic area.",

Mentally impaired residents consumed fewer drugs than mentally intact ones. In a logistic regression analysis the use of NSAIDS, beta-blockers and anxiolytics was significantly lower in mentally impaired residents (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.80, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-0.95, and OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.94, respectively), and the use of laxatives and vitamin B-12 higher (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.04-4.62, and OR 5.08, 95% CI 1.11-23.25, respectively). Twenty percent of mentally intact and 21% of mentally impaired residents have potentially harmful two-by-two drug combinations, and drugs augmenting sedating properties were dominating. The prevalence of inappropriately used drugs was significantly lower in mentally impaired residents (20%) than in mentally intact ones (33%).

    "124": "Olanzapine was more effective than haloperidol in reducing severity of psychopathology and in improving QOL in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The QOL benefits of olanzapine, although modest, may be important for long-term treatment.", 
    "125": "The cognitive and psychomotor effects of olanzapine (3 mg) were compared with haloperidol (3 mg) and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study. Fourteen healthy elderly volunteers (>65 years) were randomized to receive once daily medication for 4 days with a 16-day interval between treatment periods. Assessments of attention, memory and motor control were made prior to dosing on each day, at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after dosing on days 1 and 4, and at 24 and 48 h following the last dose. On day 1, detectable impairment was observed at all time points in both groups. On day 4, haloperidol treated subjects showed increased impairment compared with day 1 and this was sustained throughout the 48 h of testing. Olanzapine treated subjects showed reduced day 4 deficit (compared with day 1), with no significant difference from placebo beyond 6 h post dose. These results suggest that both haloperidol and olanzapine have a measurable initial effect on cognitive and psychomotor function in elderly volunteers. However, acute effects associated with olanzapine decrease with repeated dosing and show substantial adaptation within 4 days. In contrast, effects seen with haloperidol are sustained and increase with repeated dosing over the same period.", 
    "126": "The effects of buspirone, fluvoxamine and diazepam were investigated, using healthy volunteers, in an aversive conditioning paradigm, a putative model for conditioned anxiety. The main prediction was that buspirone, an anxiolytic agent which reduces activity in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT) neurones, would attenuate aversively conditioned skin conductance responses. Skin conductance responses were recorded to 10 neutral tones (habituation phase). Tone 11 was immediately followed by a 1-s 90-dB aversive white noise (unconditioned stimulus). The conditioning trial reinstated responding to a second presentation of the tones (extinction phase). Skin conductance response amplitude, inter-response level and spontaneous fluctuations were recorded. There were five treatment groups comprising five men and five women. One control group took placebo, another control group received nothing; there was no effect of placebo on any measure. Diazepam (2 mg, p.o.), a positive comparator, markedly reduced the amplitude of skin conductance responses at all phases of the experiment, but only in women. Buspirone (5 mg, p.o.) had the predicted effect of accelerating extinction but also of unexpectedly accelerated habituation of skin conductance responses. There was a trend to reduce spontaneous fluctuations and no effect on skin conductance level. The effects of buspirone were thus specific to responses to stimuli. Fluvoxamine (25 mg, p.o.) had similar effects to buspirone and diazepam in women. An action common to buspirone, fluvoxamine and diazepam, which may account for their shared effect on conditioned autonomic responses, is the suppression of neural activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus. It is argued that enhanced habituation must involve a different mechanism, such as enhanced 5-HT1A function in the terminal fields of the median raphe nucleus.", 
    "127": "The pain experience in the child with a significant neurological impairment is complex and confusing, and it raises many questions about the very nature of pain itself. Early work in this field suggests that the pain experience may be blunted. The neurological impairment associated with conditions such as cerebral palsy may alter the neurological system and hence the ability to comprehend and communicate pain; there is no evidence to date that this reflects true pain insensitivity or indifference. From recent work, the emerging body of evidence supports a relationship between the pain system and the motor, sensory, and autonomic systems and demonstrates how alterations to these systems may have a profound and unique impact on the pain experience. Beyond the altered neurological substrate, communication disabilities and social/environmental factors also seem to alter the pain experience. Establishing a clear pain history, including baseline information of child-specific patterns of behaviors and ongoing comparative use of this information over time, can provide clinically meaningful measures. Pain management should be directed at the underlying sources of pain and should include the analgesic ladder for everyday pain, opioids for acute/procedural pain (+/- benzodiazepine adjuvants), and antispasticity medications for high tone. With appropriate monitoring, demand and regional analgesic techniques can provide effective and safe postoperative pain control. The lack of basic and clinical knowledge in this field, however, adds another challenge to the clinician.", 
    "128": "We studied electromyography (EMG) of the geniohyoid muscle (Gh) and diaphragm (Di) in 12 postoperative, premedicated (flunitrazepam 2 mg PO), asymptomatic patients who snored after recovering from general anesthesia, the induction of which was partly achieved by i.v. midazolam. After extubation of the trachea, integrated EMG activity of Gh (E-Gh(MTA)) and Di (E-Di(MTA)) were measured. For Gh, tonic and phasic activity were distinguished. Patients were studied during obstructive apnea, at the end of apnea, while breathing through an artificial Guedel airway, and during quiet breathing 5 min after flumazemil. All patients experienced episodes of postoperative upper airway obstruction and nine became apneic. Flumazenil restored consciousness and predominant tonic E-GhMTA associated with upper airway patency in all patients. Reduced tonic E-GhMTA characterized postoperative obstructive apnea. Resolution of apnea required a burst of both tonic and phasic E-GhMTA associated with intense E-Di(MTA). Breathing through the Guedal airway resulted in patent airway in 8 of 10 patients and was associated with low tonic and phasic E-GhMTA and reduced E-Di(MTA). In this study, we demonstrated that the tonic pharyngeal muscular support modulates airway patency in the postoperative period. Because it is reversed by flumazemil, benzodiazepines are certainly the main cause of airway obstruction in these patients.", 
    "129": "Upper airway obstruction during recovery from general anesthesia induced by i.v. midazolam is associated with low tonic pharyngeal muscular support, which modulates upper airway patency in the postoperative period.", 
    "130": "Midazolam may be a useful analgesic when administered intrathecally. However, neurotoxicity must be excluded. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether spinally administered midazolam induces acute-phase histopathological or inflammatory reactions of the spinal cord. A lumbar laminectomy was performed on 40 cats, and their spinal cords were exposed. Midazolam 10 mg (2 mL, n = 20 cats) or saline 2 mL (20 cats) was administered directly to the spinal cord. At 1, 2, 4, or 6 h after the administration, cats were killed, and the lumbar spinal cord was removed and fixed in 10% formalin. Histology was examined using light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Both groups showed slight to moderate changes in the spinal cord, but no severe damage was observed. Inflammatory reactions were seen in only one cat in the saline group with slight neutrophil infiltration. These changes were not different between the midazolam group and the saline group. In conclusion, up to 6 h after direct exposure to midazolam, no acute histological damage or inflammatory reaction of the spinal cord was seen in cats.", 
    "131": "Spinally administered midazolam, even in large doses, does not cause acute neurotoxicity or inflammation of the spinal cord.", 
    "132": "Drug-induced delirium is often seen in clinical practice. Most knowledge about delirium-inducing drugs comes from reports on side effects, and few systematic studies have been done in the field. Delirium is strongly associated with anticholinergic activity; drugs of different classes, including tricyclic antidepressants and traditional high-dose neuroleptics, constitute a high-risk group. A large number of drugs, including benzodiazepines, sedatives, dopamine-activating drugs, antiepileptics, histamine H2 receptor blockers, digitalis and analgesics, are less frequently associated with delirious reactions and constitute a medium-high-risk group. Some of these drugs do not have anticholinergic effects but in vitro have shown to bind to muscarine receptors. The risk of inducing delirium in frail elderly and demented persons clearly suggests that drugs which might induced delirium should be avoided.", 
    "133": "Quazepam, a trifluoroethylbenzodiazepine hypnotic, and triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic, differ in terms of their benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile. Previous studies have suggested that quazepam produces less performance impairment than triazolam. Whether these effects are due to differences between quazepam and triazolam in terms of their benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile or to the testing of insufficient doses is unknown. The present study compared the acute behavioral effects of triazolam (0.1875, 0.3750, and 0.5625 mg), quazepam (30, 60, and 90 mg), and placebo in 12 healthy humans using a within-subjects, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Quazepam and triazolam produced comparable dose-dependent performance impairment and increased ratings of drug effect and drowsy. Quazepam, but not triazolam, increased ratings of dizzy/light-headed, performance impaired, and sleepy. Triazolam, but not quazepam, increased ratings of high. Thus, across a sufficient range of doses, the performance-impairing effects of quazepam were similar to those of triazolam. By contrast, quazepam and triazolam produced somewhat different constellations of participant-rated drug effects. These differential drug effects may be attributable to differences between quazepam and triazolam in terms of their benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile.", 
    "134": "Catatonia, a symptom complex with motor, affective and cognitive symptoms seen in a variety of psychotic conditions and with organic disease, was examined using a motor task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).", 
    "135": "Two acute catatonic patients and two age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed sequential finger opposition (SFO) after being medicated with 2 mg of lorazepam (i.v.). Functional magnetic resonance images were collected using a gradient echo pulse sequence (EPI).", 
    "136": "Patients with catatonia showed reduced motor activation of the contralateral motor cortex during SFO of the right hand, ipsilateral activation was similar for patients and controls. There were no differences in the activation of the SMA. During left hand activation the right-handed catatonic patients showed more activation in the ipsilateral cortex, a reversal from the normal pattern of activation in which the contralateral side shows four to five times more activation than the ipsilateral side.", 
    "137": "In catatonic patients there is a decreased activation in motor cortex during a motor task compared to matched medicated healthy controls. In addition activation of the non-dominant side, left-handed activity in right-handed patients, results in a total reversal of the normal pattern of lateral activation suggesting a disturbance in hemispheric localization of activity during a catatonic state.", 
    "138": "Glutamatergic regulation of neurofilament expression, phosphorylation and accumulation in cultured spinal cord neurons was studied. At seven days in culture, 0.15% of the neurons were immunoreactive for non-phosphorylated neurofilaments, but essentially no cells immunoreactive for phosphorylated neurofilaments were seen. The number and size of the immunoreactive cells in culture corresponded well to those of rat and human spinal cord neurons in vivo. In spinal cord cultures, sublethal, long-lasting stimulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)/kainate or metabotrophic receptors, but not N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, dose-dependently increased the number of non-phosphorylated neurofilament-immunoreactive cells, which was blocked by nifedipine, an antagonist of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Stimulation of kainate or all non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors decreased the expression of medium-molecular-weight neurofilament messenger RNA. Blockade of AMPA/kainate receptors, but not of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, increased the amount of phosphorylated neurofilament protein and the number of phosphorylated neurofilament-immunoreactive cell bodies. The phosphorylated neurofilament-immunoreactive cell population was different from the non-phosphorylated neurofilament-immunoreactive neurons, which lost their axonal non-phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactivity but showed intense cytoplasmic labeling in response to the blockade of AMPA/ kainate receptors. Immunoreactivity for phosphoserine did not change upon glutamate receptor stimulation and blockade. The results show that activation of AMPA/kainate receptors decreases the expression of neurofilament messenger RNA and neurofilament phosphorylation in spinal cord neurons by a mechanism involving active voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Blockade of these receptors seems to disturb axonal neurofilament transport. Because AMPA/kainate receptors mediate chronic glutamatergic death of spinal motor neurons and these receptors have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the observed alteration in neurofilament phosphorylation and distribution may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic motor neuron diseases.", 
    "139": "Investigations with specific PET ligands that bind to specific neuro-receptors give information on abnormalities of neurotransmission involved in the pathophysiology of the epilepsies. Data need to be interpreted in the light of optimal structural imaging. Objective voxel-based and region-based analyses, with correction of partial volume effect, are complementary. Central benzodiazepine (cBZR) and opioid receptors have been studied most. Reduced cBZR binding is commonly seen at an epileptic focus, in a more restricted distribution than an area of hypometabolism, and sometimes also in projection areas. In contrast to acquired lesions causing partial seizures, focal increases in cBZR binding have been demonstrated in malformations of cortical development and also in areas of brain that appear normal on MRI, indicating the widespread nature of the abnormalities. Focal abnormalities of cBZR are also commonly found in patients with partial seizures and normal MRI. It is not yet clear how useful these data will prove to be in presurgical evaluation. Mu- and delta-opioid receptors have been found to be increased in temporal neocortex overlying mesial temporal epileptic foci, but with different patterns of increase. Dynamic studies of the binding of 11C-diprenorphine to opioid receptors are possible using PET, and have implied the release of cerebral endogenous opioids at the time of serial absences and reflex seizures induced by reading. Other tracers, that have been applied less widely, label the enzyme monoamine oxidase type B and peripheral benzodiazepine and histamine H1 receptors.", 
    "140": "Recent postmortem studies have demonstrated subtle alterations in the hippocampal formation (HIPP) of patients with schizophrenia (SZ). These changes include a decreased density of nonpyramidal neurons (NPs), an increase of the GABAA, but not benzodiazepine receptors and a neuroleptic-dose-related increase of GAD65-IR terminals, particularly in sectors CA3 and CA2. High resolution studies of the GABAA receptor have further suggested that a decrease of disinhibitory GABAergic activity (i.e., GABA-to-GABA) in stratum pyramidale of CA3 may coexist with reduced inhibitory modulation (i.e., GABA-to-excitatory pyramidal neuron) in the stratum oriens of this same sector. These changes could potentially involve excitotoxic damage to interneurons in CA2; but, the precise time frame for the induction of such an injury during pre- versus postnatal life cannot as yet be inferred from the available data. These findings are consistent with reports of abnormal oscillatory rhythms and increased basal metabolic activity in the HIPP of patients with SZ. The fact that patients with manic depression also show a decrease of NPs in CA2 suggests that changes in the GABA system may not be related to a susceptibility gene for SZ. Rather, these alterations could be associated with a nonspecific factor, such as stress, experienced either early in life or much later during adolescence or adulthood. Presumably, there are also changes associated in other transmitter systems that may play a more specific role in establishing the SZ phenotype.", 
    "141": "We have studied the effect of a bolus dose of midazolam on the auditory evoked response (AER) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in nine patients. We measured the AER in the awake patient, at the point of loss of the eyelash reflex and when airway support was required. The eyelash reflex was lost at mean 1.78 (SD 0.5) min after administration of the midazolam bolus dose. Time to airway support in the seven patients who required it was 2.74 (1.26) min. Mean Nb latency in awake patients was 44.3 ms (95% CI 41.9-46.9) which was significantly shorter than Nb latency at the clinical end-points (P < 0.001). When the eyelash reflex was lost, Nb latency was 55.7 ms (95% CI 51.4-60.3) and when airway support was needed, it was 50.9 ms (95% CI 48.6-53.2). We conclude that loss of consciousness after midazolam was associated with an increase in mean Nb latency.", 
    "142": "The effects of diazepam, which acts at GABAA receptors to enhance the effects of GABA, and ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, on local rates of cerebral glucose utilization (ICMRglc) were examined in unrestrained rats. Four groups were studied: vehicle-injected controls; and ketamine-treated, diazepam-treated and combined ketamine- and diazepam-treated animals. Ketamine alone produced a heterogeneous pattern of changes in ICMRglc (e.g. significant increases in the corpus callosum, olfactory tubercle and the entire Papez circuit, in addition to other limbic areas, and significant decreases in lateral habenula and some components of the auditory system). Diazepam alone statistically significantly decreased ICMRglc in the brain as a whole and in most areas of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and limbic system. The most remarkable effects of the two drugs administered together on ICMRglc occurred in the limbic system where the dramatic increases observed with ketamine alone were prevented by treatment with diazepam.", 
    "143": "We have investigated the relationship between oral mucosal blood flow and plasma epinephrine concentration, and the effects of conscious sedation vs general anaesthesia on haemodynamic responses after submucosal epinephrine injection in 14 subjects. The same seven patients were studied both as controls and after sedation. For sedation, midazolam i.v. was used. Another seven patients underwent orthognathic surgery with isoflurane anaesthesia. All subjects received a submucosal injection of epinephrine 0.8 microgram kg-1, given as 2% lidocaine hydrochloride with epinephrine 12.5 micrograms ml-1. Baseline mucosal blood flow and peak increase in plasma epinephrine concentration in the general anaesthesia and sedation groups were approximately 2.0 and 1.5 times, respectively, higher than those in the control group. Mean plasma epinephrine concentration reached a maximum 3 min after administration of epinephrine in all groups. Overall, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.65) between baseline mucosal blood flow and the maximum increase in plasma epinephrine concentration. There were no differences in haemodynamic changes except for heart rate, between the three groups. These results suggest that plasma epinephrine concentration after submucosal injection depends on the initial mucosal blood flow in the injected area. Haemodynamic changes, except heart rate, in the sedation and general anaesthesia groups were similar despite different changes in maximum plasma epinephrine concentration."
