Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been shown to decrease meal size in many species including humans. In the present study we investigated the role of endogenous CCK in mediating the hyperphagia of male and female obese Zucker rats. CCKA-type receptors were blocked with the specific antagonist, devazepide, and test meal size was measured. Male obese and lean rats significantly increased food intake following devazepide. Neither obese nor lean female rats significantly increased food intake following devazepide. This is the first demonstration of a gender difference in endogenous CCK-mediated satiety. These results have implications for the higher incidence of eating disorders in females.", 
    "1": "Pigs have a strong appetite for sugar solutions and readily learn to perform operant responses (pressing a panel with their snouts) to obtain glucose solution. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 1 microgram CCK produced a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the amount of glucose consumed compared with saline in the 30 min following injection. The reduction was a central effect as the same dose of CCK was ineffective given intravenously. The inhibition of intake was completely abolished by prior dosing with 100 micrograms of the CCKA receptor antagonist Devazepide given ICV. Devazepide itself had no effect on intake. The pig is a good experimental animal for the study of the regulation of sugar intake.", 
    "2": "To assess the influence of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor on sleep and sleep EEG, rats were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle, two doses of muscimol (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg), a selective GABAA agonist, and midazolam (3 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine-GABAA agonist. EEG and EMG recordings were made for 6 or 8 hours. Muscimol dose-dependently increased the amount of nonrapid eye movement sleep (nonREMS) and REMS. The higher dose of muscimol enhanced EEG activity over almost the entire frequency range (0.5-25 Hz), including delta (0.5-4 Hz) and sigma (11-16 Hz) activity, within nonREMS and in the frequencies over 10 Hz within REMS. Midazolam also increased the amount of nonREMS. However, most of the other effects of midazolam contrasted the effects of muscimol: midazolam decreased REMS, reduced low frequency (< or = 11 Hz) EEG activity within nonREMS, and enhanced the activity in higher frequencies during both nonREMS and REMS. These data demonstrate the involvement of GABAA receptors in the regulation of sleep-wake behavior as well as in the generation of spindles and delta waves during nonREMS. The effects of these two GABAA agonists indicate that activation of different binding sites on the GABAA receptor complex differentially affect sleep states and sleep EEG.", 
    "3": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA has been shown to be critically involved in shaping neuronal responses to simple and complex acoustic stimuli in the inferior colliculus. Studies in the rat and human inferior colliculus have suggested significant changes in functions related to GABA neurotransmission occur in the aged. These changes include significant decreases in GABA content, GABA release, GABA neurons, glutamate decarboxylase enzymatic activity, and GABAB receptor binding. Such changes within the inferior colliculus may affect the ability of elderly listeners to process complex acoustic signals, particularly in the presence of background noise. The present study was designed to examine the regional distribution and effects of aging on GABAA receptor binding sites in the Fischer 344 rat inferior colliculus using in vitro quantitative receptor autoradiography. [3H]GABA binding to GABAA receptors was significantly reduced in the inferior colliculus of young adult (3 months) and aged (18-26 months) rats when compared to 2-month animals. However, no significant changes were observed after 3 months of age. Single concentrations of tritiated GABAA receptor ligands (muscimol, t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate, and flunitrazepam) revealed no significant age-related changes in receptor binding in the inferior colliculus between 3 and 26 months of age. To characterize further the pharmacology of the GABAA receptor in the inferior colliculus, GABA modulation of the picrotoxin binding site was examined using [3H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate. When increasing concentrations of GABA were added to the incubation buffer, a significant decrease in binding was observed in the inferior colliculus of rats in each age group. In aged rats, the dose-response curve was shifted to the left, indicating an increase in the potency of GABA to inhibit [3H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate binding. Although no changes in GABAA receptor binding were detected in the inferior colliculus after 3 months of age, a significant alteration in interaction between the GABA and picrotoxin binding sites was observed in the inferior colliculus of aged rats when compared to 3-month-old young adults. This difference appears to reflect an increased sensitivity of the receptor to GABA modulation in aged rats and, thus, may serve as a compensatory mechanism to enhance GABAA receptor function in response to a presynaptic loss of inhibition.", 
    "4": "The median anesthetic concentrations (AC 50 values) in the bath solution for loss of righting reflex (RR) or nociceptor response (NR) were determined in larval Rana catesbeiana. The AC50 (NR)/AC50(RR) ratios were between 1.6 and 1.9 for ethanol, ether and diazepam. Comparable ratios for hexobarbital and thiopental were 9.8 and 6.2, which indicated a marked lack of \"analgesic\" effect. The tadpole AC50 values were consistently higher than AC50 values reported for nonionized and unbound drug in mammalian blood water. The tadpole/mammal ratio for loss of NR during thiopental anesthesia was approximate 8, and analysis of ventricular blood showed that the ultrahigh bath concentrations of thiopental were in equilibrium with those in tadpole serum. The tadpole/mammal ratio for diazepam was approximate 110, and its effect in the tadpole was not reversed by flumazenil. Tadpole/mammal ratios for ethanol and ether were approximate 2. Ethanol and ether showed additive effects when tested in combination, and ethanol-tolerant tadpoles showed a similar tolerance to ether. In contrast, hexobarbital and ethanol showed supra-additive effects, and ethanol-tolerant tadpoles showed a greater tolerance to hexobarbital than to ethanol or ether. These studies show marked differences in effect between barbiturates and the ethanol-ether group, high-concentration benzodiazepine effects presumably independent of a specific receptor, and marked differences in drug potency between amphibia and mammals.", 
    "5": "Neurotensin microinjection into the medullary nucleus raphe magnus (RMg) has been shown to both inhibit and facilitate the spinal nociceptive tail-flick reflex in a dose-dependent manner. Our study was designed to determine a potential involvement of spinal cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK) in mediating neurotensin hyperalgesia from the RMg. Microinjection of neurotensin (50 ng) into the RMg of awake rats produced a facilitation of the tail-flick reflex that was completely inhibited by intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the nonselective CCK receptor antagonist proglumide (100 ng). Conversely, injection of a greater dose of neurotensin (5 micrograms) into the RMg produced an inhibition of the tail-flick reflex that was enhanced by i.t. proglumide. Intrathecal administration of the selective CCKB receptor antagonist L-365260 dose-dependently inhibited neurotensin hyperalgesia from the RMg (ID50 = 0.42 ng) at doses approximately 1000-fold less than that observed with the selective CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide (ID50 = 646 ng). Injection of CCK alone i.t. produced a biphasic response on the tail-flick reflex as lesser doses (0.1-0.3 ng) inhibited the reflex although greater doses (30-100 ng) facilitated it. Similar to supraspinal neurotensin hyperalgesia, the hyperalgesia observed with i.t. CCK (30 ng) was inhibited by i.t. L-365260 (ID50 = 0.59 ng) at doses approximately 1000-fold less than that observed with i.t. devazepide (ID50 = 630 ng). These data indicate that spinal CCK can both inhibit and facilitate spinal nociceptive responses. The facilitation of nociception observed with spinal CCK appears to involve CCKB receptors, which is consistent with the data in our study suggesting that spinal CCKB receptors mediate neurotensin hyperalgesia from the RMg via descending neuronal projections.", 
    "6": "In pigeons trained to discriminate between pentobarbital and saline, pentobarbital, amobarbital and diazepam substituted for pentobarbital, whereas phencyclidine (PCP) substituted in part for pentobarbital and d-amphetamine, morphine and drug vehicles did not substitute. After morphine replaced pentobarbital as the training drug (group A), morphine, pentobarbital and diazepam substituted, PCP substituted in part, but not d-amphetamine, haloperidol and vehicles. After d-amphetamine replaced pentobarbital as the training drug (group B), d-amphetamine, pentobarbital and diazepam substituted, PCP substituted in part, but not haloperidol, morphine and vehicles. Next, morphine and d-amphetamine were reversed as training drugs for the two groups. In group A, morphine, d-amphetamine, pentobarbital and diazepam substituted, PCP substituted in part, but not haloperidol and vehicles. Similar effects were observed in group B. Next, birds in group A were reinforced for responses on the drug key (red key) after d-amphetamine and on the previous saline key (green key) after pentobarbital. In group B, morphine continued as the training drug for the red key, whereas responses on the green key were reinforced after pentobarbital. In group A, d-amphetamine, morphine, d-pentazocine and to some extent PCP, produced responding on the red key, whereas pentobarbital, diazepam, haloperidol and the vehicles produced responding on the green key. Similar results were obtained in group B. Finally, responses were reinforced on the green key after pentobarbital and on the red key after saline. Group B did not learn this discrimination. In group A, responding occurred on the red key after d-amphetamine, morphine, haloperidol and vehicles, in part after d-pentazocine, but not after pentobarbital, diazepam and PCP. These experiments show that drug stimuli can continue to exert stimulus control over behavior for long periods, even when training with several other drug stimuli intervenes between tests, and the experiments also show that through sequential training procedures multiple drugs can serve as discriminative stimuli for the same response, even when these drugs are from different phamacological classes.", 
    "7": "The behavioral response elicited in mice by an i.p. injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1) (0.1 mg/kg) was differentiated from that elicited by standard agents such as acetylcholine (ACh) (5.5 mg/kg) or phenyl-p-quinone (PpQ) (1.25 mg/kg). First, there was lack of two-way \"cross-tolerance' between test paradigms. That is, at equieffective doses, a 60-min prior i.p. injection of ET-1 blocked the behavioral response to a subsequent i.p. injection of ET-1 or PpQ, but not of ACh, whereas a 60-min prior injection of ACh or of PpQ had no effect on a subsequent i.p. injection of ACh, PpQ or ET-1. Second, differential antagonism of ET-1-, ACh- or PpQ-induced responses was observed in an examination of 36 test compounds. For example, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin and ibuprofen did not block the ET-1-induced response at > 10 times the doses that blocked ACh- or PpQ-induced responses, whereas other compounds (such as certain benzodiazepines) inhibited ET-1-induced, but not ACh- or PpQ-induced, responses. These findings suggest that ET-1 produces a novel nociceptive stimulus, mechanistically distinct from ACh and PpQ. Hence, the ET-1-induced behavioral response in mice serves as a rapid and convenient measure of in vivo endothelin activity. In addition, this test might be a model for clinical pains not adequately treated by present analgesic agents or adequately tested by preclinical antinociceptive screens using ACh or PpQ. As such, it is a potentially valuable model for the identification of novel analgesic and other agents.", 
    "8": "A relatively simple ELISA technique was developed for the detection of a range of benzodiazepines (BZs) in urine. The assay employs a mouse anti-oxazepam antibody that is highly specific for the BZs. The limit of detection using 10 microliters samples of urine was 0.3 microgram ml-1 oxazepam. N-Desmethyldiazepam showed equal cross-reactivity to oxazepam, 11 BZs cross-reacted weakly and flurazepam and chlordiazepoxide did not cross-react at levels reported to be found in urine. No cross-reactivity was observed with drugs of abuse and a range of therapeutic drugs commonly found in urine. The assay was used as a screen to detect the presence of BZs in urine from 88 addicts that had been screened by the EMIT technique and a radioreceptor assay (RRA) for BZs. The ELISA produced two false negatives that were EMIT and RRA positive whereas the EMIT produced four different false negatives that were positive by both ELISA and RRA. Thirty-three positives were common to all three assays. The ELISA was also used to monitor nitrazepam-like activity in the urine of a greyhound receiving 5 mg oral medication and the results were compared with those obtained by RRA. Both assays were able to detect nitrazepam-like activity for up to 10 h post-administration.", 
    "9": "To investigate the effects of heavy social drinking on sober cognitive processing, event-related potentials were recorded from 13 heavy social drinkers and 13 light social drinkers in the presence and absence of a pharmacological challenge (i.e., lorazepam). Event-related potentials were elicited by a task requiring continuous recognition memory for visually presented words. The heavy social drinkers exhibited shorter P2 latencies than the light social drinkers and decreased P300 latencies to correctly identified \"old\" words (i.e., words presented previously in the task) versus \"new\" words. Lorazepam increased motor reaction time to correctly identified old words and produced a deficit in recognition memory only in the light social drinkers. Light social drinkers had an increased P300 latency and a larger P300 amplitude to new words in the lorazepam treatment. The differences in cognitive functioning evident between heavy and light social drinkers were reflected in event-related potential deviations and appear to indicate a tolerance in heavy social drinkers to the effects of lorazepam.", 
    "10": "Previous work indicates that endogenous CCK mediates suppression of sham feeding by some intraintestinal nutrients. To test whether the mechanism involved is dependent upon action at type A or type B CCK receptors, we examined the ability of CCKA (devazepide) and CCKB (L-365,260) receptor antagonists to attenuate the suppression of sham feeding by intraintestinal oleic acid, maltotriose, or L-phenylalanine. Suppression by oleic acid or maltotriose was dose dependently attenuated by intraperitoneal administration of the CCKA receptor antagonist, as was suppression by exogenous CCK. The CCKB receptor antagonist failed to attenuate the suppression of sham feeding by these nutrients. Neither receptor antagonist attenuated the suppression of sham feeding induced by intraintestinal L-phenylalanine. These results suggest that suppression of sham feeding by intestinally infused oleic acid and maltotriose is mediated by endogenous CCK acting at CCKA receptors.", 
    "11": "The effects of acute challenge with ethanol were studied in a putative rodent model of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic administration of fluphenazine elicited vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) in the rat. Neuroleptic-induced VCMs were dose dependently suppressed by ethanol in a behaviorally specific fashion. Suppression by ethanol of neuroleptic-induced VCMs was reversed by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (2.5 mg/kg). These findings suggest that ethanol may acutely suppress neuroleptic-induced dyskinesias in humans via stimulation of GABAA receptors and are compatible with the previously reported clinical effects of alcohol consumption on the extrapyramidal system. Treatment strategies focussed on GABAergic stimulation deserve further investigation in the management of tardive dyskinesia.",

Laboratory studies showed anemia (168 x 10(4).mm-3), leukopenia (2300.mm-3) and thrombocytopenia (5000.mm-3). Bleeding time exceeded 30 min, but the transfusion of fresh platelet concentrate was not effective for bleeding tendency. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.5 mg and fentanyl 100 micrograms, and maintained with N2O-O2-sevoflurane through a mask. The operation, which lasted for 40 min, was uneventful without marked hemodynamic changes, bucking or massive bleeding. Although 100 units of fresh platelet and 13 units of leucocyte poor red cells were infused during hospitalization, macrohematuria continued for about 3 weeks after this operation.", 
    "13": "A 60-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma extending through inferior vena cava into the right atrium was scheduled for the removal of the right kidney under general anesthesia and the cardiopulmonary bypass technique. In order to obtain a clear operative field and to minimize the risk for pulmonary embolism of necrotizing tumor, total circulatory arrest under profound hypothermia (20 degrees C) was performed. Anesthesia was maintained with high doses of fentanyl (62 micrograms.kg-1), midazolam and supplemented with enflurane. We attempted to prevent circulatory collapse due to acute pulmonary embolism by tumor fragments during operation. The body temperature of the patient was decreased down to 20 degrees C for protecting central nervous system with the minimal damage. No complications occurred during anesthesia and the post-operative period. For the safe anesthetic management of the patient such as our case, adequate monitoring of circulation and protection of central nervous system are essential.",

    "15": "A series of (3-substituted phenyl)urea analogues of the potent gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor antagonist YM022 has been prepared. Structure-activity relationship studies of this series suggested that a number of analogues retained good in vitro potency for gastrin/CCK-B receptor. In particular, the (3-amino substituted phenyl)urea derivatives (10-12) were more potent inhibitors of pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion in rats than YM022 on intraduodenal (i.d.) administration.", 
    "16": "It has been proposed that excessive intrarenal conversion of cortisol to 6 beta-hydroxycortisol by CYP3A may mediate increased tubular reabsorption of sodium, leading to a state of mild volume expansion and the clinical phenotype of salt-sensitive hypertension. Therefore, we characterized CYP3A activity in a bank of microsomes from human kidneys using the formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1'-OHM) as a prototypical CYP3A-catalyzed reaction. Maximal rates of metabolite formation occurred at midazolam concentrations of 12.5-50 microM; higher concentrations resulted in dramatic substrate inhibition. At 12.5 microM midazolam, 4 of 27 kidneys exhibited relatively high mean +/- standard deviation 1'-OHM formation rate (184.0 +/- 14.4 pmol/hr/mg) compared with the remaining 23 samples, which had a mean formation rate of (10.1 +/- 6.4 pmol/hr/mg). Triacetyloleandomycin and anti-CYP3A antibody inhibited midazolam hydroxylation by 53% and 57%, respectively. The correlation between CYP3A5 content, determined through immunoblotting, and 1'-OHM formation rate was high (r2 = 0.84, 24 experiments). The expressions of mRNA corresponding to CYP3A3, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 were determined through polymerase chain reaction with specific oligonucleotides as primers. All kidneys examined (25 experiments) expressed CYP3A5 protein and contained the corresponding CYP3A5 mRNA. CYP3A4 mRNA was detected in 40% of the kidney samples, and 70% of those that contained detectable CYP3A4 mRNA also expressed detectable levels of the corresponding protein. Therefore, in contrast to hepatic tissue, in which CYP3A4 is universally expressed, CYP3A5 is the ubiquitously expressed member of the CYP3A family in renal tissue. The distribution of enzyme activity and protein content suggests bimodality and may represent induction of CYP3A5 in a select population and/or a genetically determined organ-specific pattern of expression.", 
    "17": "The cDNAs encoding alpha 5 and gamma 2L subunit subtypes of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor (GABAR) were transfected into L929 cells together with cDNAs encoding either the beta 1, beta 2, or beta 3 subunit subtype. Properties of expressed recombinant alpha 5 beta X gamma 2L (where X = 1,2, or 3) GABARs were studied with the use of whole-cell, patch-clamp techniques. In cells voltage-clamped at -70 mV with equlvalent bath and pipette chloride concentrations, the application of GABA produced a concentration-dependent inward chloride current with all three alpha 5 beta X gamma 2L isoforms. Minimal or no responses were recorded from cells transfected with only two subunit cDNAs, demonstrating that all three subunits were required for functional receptor assembly in these cells. The GABA concentration producing a half-maximal current was similar for beta 2 and beta 3 subtype-containing receptors (6 microM) but higher for beta 1 subtype-containing receptors (26 microM). alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2L receptors were zinc and diazepam sensitive but zolpidem insensitive. In response to low GABA concentrations, beta 1 and beta 3 subtype-containing receptors showed outward rectification of the current-voltage relationship, whereas current-voltage responses of beta 2 subtype-containing receptors were relatively linear. Likewise, at high GABA concentrations, beta 1 and beta 3 subtype-containing receptors showed less desensitization at positive than at negative membrane potentials. Beta 2 subtype-containing receptors displayed faster desensitization at depolarized potentials. These voltage-dependent properties were characteristic of alpha 5 but not alpha 1 or alpha 6 subtype-containing receptors and were similar to responses recorded from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Based on the pharmacological and biophysical similarities to hippocampal GABAR responses, the alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2L isoform could represent a native GABAR subtype.", 
    "18": "Cholecystokinin (CCK)-B and gastrin receptors are expressed on a variety of human tumor cells. Recently, we have demonstrated that the human brain CCK-B receptors are identical to the gastrin receptors derived from the stomach mucosa, and that the brain-gut peptides, CCK-8 and gastrin I are mitogenic for mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing human CCK-B/gastrin receptors (N-hCCKBR). In this report, we evaluated the antiproliferative potency of CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonists by using N-hCCKBR cells. Among several antagonists, a benzodiazepine derivative, YM022 had the most potent activities in competing with [125I]CCK-8 or [125I]gastrin I binding, inhibition of CCK-8- or gastrin I-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increasing cytoplasmic free calcium. Interestingly, a potent antagonist for rat CCK-B/gastrin receptors did not have such activities in N-hCCKBR cells. YM022 inhibited the CCK-8- or gastrin I-induced [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation of N-hCCKBR cells in a dose-dependent manner. In the absence of exogenous peptide ligands, YM022 also inhibited the proliferation of several human cancer cell lines expressing the genes for both gastrin and its receptor. These results suggest that YM022 could intervene in the autocrine stimulation of human tumor cell lines through CCK-B/gastrin receptors. N-hCCKBR cells are an excellent tool to screen for novel human CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonists possessing antiproliferative activity for human cancer cells.", 
    "19": "Transient focal neurologic deficits have been observed in patients emerging from brain tumor or carotid surgery, and a pharmacologic effect of anesthetic agents has been proposed as the cause of such neurologic dysfunction. Therefore, the effect of sedation with midazolam or fentanyl on motor neurologic function was studied prospectively and preoperatively in patients with carotid disease or mass lesions of the brain.", 
    "20": "Fifty-four unpremedicated adult patients with carotid disease or a brain tumor were given small intravenous doses of either 2.8 +/- 1.3 mg midazolam or 170 +/- 60 micrograms fentanyl in the preoperative period. A thorough motor examination was performed at baseline and after sedation by an individual who was unaware of the details of the patient's disease or symptoms. A mental status examination also was performed to control for the effects of inattentiveness or lack of cooperation during the neurologic examination.", 
    "21": "Patients were sedated mildly but were fully cooperative. Focal motor deterioration occurred after sedation in 30% of patients, and the incidence was similar in patients in the fentanyl and midazolam groups. Among patients with a focal motor abnormality on baseline examination or a resolved prior motor deficit, 73% had exacerbation or unmasking of these signs by sedation, whereas no patient without a prior history of motor dysfunction had a sedative-induced change. Sedative-induced changes in neurologic function ranged from unilateral mild weakness to complete plegia, but appeared to be transient in nature.",

    "23": "The in vivo intestinal metabolism of the CYP3A probe midazolam to its principal metabolite, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, was investigated during surgery in 10 liver transplant recipients. After removal of the diseased liver, five subjects received 2 mg midazolam intraduodenally, and the other five received 1 mg midazolam intravenously. Simultaneous arterial and hepatic portal venous blood samples were collected during the anhepatic phase; collection of arterial samples continued after reperfusion of the donor liver. Midazolam, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, and 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide were measured in plasma. A mass balance approach that considered the net change in midazolam (intravenously) or midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam (intraduodenally) concentrations across the splanchnic vascular bed during the anhepatic phase was used to quantitate the intestinal extraction of midazolam after each route of administration. For the intraduodenal group, the mean fraction of the absorbed midazolam dose that was metabolized on transit through the intestinal mucosa was 0.43 +/- 0.18. For the intravenous group, the mean fraction of midazolam extracted from arterial blood and metabolized during each passage through the splanchnic vascular bed was 0.08 +/- 0.11. Although there was significant intersubject variability, the mean intravenous and intraduodenal extraction fractions were statistically different (p = 0.009). Collectively, these results show that the small intestine contributes significantly to the first-pass oxidative metabolism of midazolam catalyzed by mucosal CYP3A4 and suggest that significant first-pass metabolism may be a general phenomenon for all high-turnover CYP3A4 substrates.",

We also evaluated causes of diagnostic delay in patients referred to the emergency room (ER) in confusional states.", 
    "26": "There was considerable overlap in clinical features of patients with complex partial SE (CPSE) and generalized nonconvulsive SE (GNSE). Delays in seeking medical attention were common. Diagnosis was significantly delayed in 10 patients. Three cases illustrate the possible markedly different presentations of NCSE.",

The pleomorphic clinical presentation of NCSE indicates that EEG and a therapeutic trial of AEDs afford the best diagnostic measures in acute waxing and waning confusional states associated with agitation, bizarre behavior, staring, increased tone, mutism, or subtle myoclonus.", 
    "28": "There is intriguing evidence suggesting pathophysiologic relationships among dyspnea, hyperventilation, and panic anxiety. The symptoms of panic attacks and pulmonary disease overlap, so that panic anxiety can reflect underlying cardiopulmonary disease and dyspnea can reflect an underlying anxiety disorder. The pathogenesis of panic may be related to respiratory physiology by several mechanisms: the anxiogenic effects of hyperventilation, the catastrophic misinterpretation of respiratory symptoms, and/or a neurobiologic sensitivity to CO2, lactate, or other signals of suffocation. In a subset of patients with PD, incipient pulmonary dysfunction may also contribute to their anxiety symptoms. Patients with pulmonary disease, particularly those with obstructive lung disease, have a high rate of panic symptoms and PD. There is reason to believe that pulmonary disease constitutes a risk factor for the development of panic related to repeated experiences with dyspnea and life-threatening exacerbations of pulmonary dysfunction, repeated episodes of hypercapnia or hyperventilation, the use of anxiogenic medications, and the stress of coping with chronic disease. Panic in pulmonary patients may carry significant morbidity, including phobic avoidance of activity, overly aggressive treatment with anxiogenic medications, and more prolonged and frequent hospitalization. Successful treatment of panic in these patients can improve functional status and quality of life by relieving anxiety and dyspnea. Nonpharmacologic treatment of panic, including cognitive-behavioral approaches, can be useful in patients with concomitant respiratory disease. Sedating medications such as benzodiazepines should be used with caution in patients with pulmonary disease to avoid respiratory depression. Serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) and anxiolytics (buspirone) may be effective treatments for panic or generalized anxiety in pulmonary patients and have relatively little potential for significant adverse effects.", 
    "29": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the functional presence of inhibitory muscarinic M2 autoreceptors on postganglionic cholinergic nerve endings in different generations of human airways. To this end, the effects of the M2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists AQ-RA 741 and gallamine were studied on electrical field stimulation-induced twitch contractions of preparations from trachea and from bronchial airways of varying diameter. Furthermore, electrically evoked release of endogenous acetylcholine from human bronchial preparations, and the effect of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine thereon, was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. On average, twitch contractions were significantly but only slightly (11 to 15%) potentiated by M2-selective concentrations of AQ-RA 741 and gallamine, despite approximately half of the preparations showing no potentiation at all. A subdivision into airway generations showed that M2 autoreceptor function was not readily detectable in bronchioles and subsegmental bronchi. By contrast, both with AQ-RA 741 and gallamine a clear potentiation (26 to 36%) of the twitch contractions was observed in approximately half of the terminal bronchi and in all central airway preparations. Moreover, the evoked release of endogenous acetylcholine in terminal and subsegmental bronchi was significantly facilitated by atropine, to 162 to 189% of controls. These results provide strong and partly direct evidence for the existence of inhibitory muscarinic M2 receptors on postganglionic cholinergic nerve endings in human central airways and subsegmental and terminal bronchi, but not in bronchioli. It remains to be established, however, why these M2 receptors exhibit a rather variable functionality in regulating cholinergic nerve-mediated contraction in different airway generations.",

The method is based on a two-compartment model (K1, influx rate constant; k2', efflux rate constant; VT' (=K1/k2'), the total distribution volumes relative to the total arterial tracer concentration), and requires two SPET scans and one blood sampling. For a given input function, the radioactivity ratio of the early to delayed scans can be considered to tabulate as a function of k2', and a table look-up procedure provides the corresponding k2' value, from which K1 and VT' values are then calculated. The arterial input function is obtained by calibration of the standard input function by the single blood sampling. SPET studies were performed on 14 patients with cerebrovascular diseases, dementia or brain tumours (mean age+/-SD, 56.0+/-12.2). None of the patients had any heart, renal or liver disease.

This study investigates the dose-dependent direct relaxation effects of midazolam and propofol on both proximal and distal ASM compared with ketamine. The proximal and distal airways were dissected from eight mongrel dogs and cut into 2-mm rings. The rings were attached to pressure transducers and equilibrated in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate bath kept at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, CO2 37 mm Hg, and PaO2 > 100 mm Hg. Optimal length was determined, a dose-response curve to acetylcholine was established, and the 50% effective dose (ED50) of acetylcholine was calculated. Ketamine, midazolam, or propofol were given in random order to each ring preconstricted with ED50 of acetylcholine in cumulative log incremental doses from 10(-6) to 10(-4) M. Relaxation response was the tension during anesthetic equilibrium, expressed as a percentage of the tension from ED50 of acetylcholine. The drug vehicles were tested for their effects on the ASM. No bronchorelaxation was seen with any of the intravenous anesthetics at 10(-6) M. Ketamine 10(-5) M produced at 17.9% +/- 2.1% relaxation in the distal ASM but had no effect on the proximal ASM. Neither propofol nor midazolam affected the ASM at 10(-5) M. The distal ASM was significantly (P < 0.005) more sensitive to 10(-4) M of all three drugs compared with the proximal ASM. In the proximal ASM, 10(-4) M of ketamine, midazolam and propofol reduced ASM tension by 14.9% +/- 4.4%, 19.0% +/-8.8%, and 14.7% +/- 5.5%, respectively, versus 36.4% +/- 3.2%, 58.6% +/- 6.1%, and 64.4% +/- 9.0% in the distal ASM. The drug vehicles had no effect on the ASM. We conclude that ketamine, midazolam, and propofol have direct relaxant effects on ASM. All three intravenous anesthetics have a greater direct relaxant effect on distal ASM than on proximal ASM. Only ketamine showed significant direct bronchorelaxing effects at concentrations that are likely to be achieved with the usual clinical dosing patterns.", 
    "71": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is located in the brain and the spinal cord, and CCK antagonist is reported to enhance the analgesic effect of morphine. It has been suggested that, during inflammation, the level of endogenous opioid peptides increases in the spinal cord. Intrathecally administered CCK antagonist may have some analgesic effect during inflammation via the activated spinal opioid system. To gain a better understanding of the roles of CCK-A and CCK-B receptors in spinal nociceptive transmission during inflammation, this study evaluated the effects of intrathecally administered FK480 (a CCK-A receptor antagonist) and YM022 (a CCK-B receptor antagonist). Inflammation was induced by paw formalin injection (formalin test) in rats. The subcutaneous injection of formalin into the hind paw evoked biphasic flinching (Phase 1, 0-9 min; Phase 2, 10-60 min) of the injected paw. Drugs were administered intrathecally 10 min before (pretreatment) or 7 min after (posttreatment) the formalin injection. Neither pretreatment nor posttreatment with FK480 has any effect on the formalin test. Pretreatment, but not posttreatment, with YM022 depressed the Phase 1 and Phase 2 flinching behavior in a dose-dependent manner, and this YM022 effect was stereospecific and was not antagonized by naloxone. These data indicate that a CCK-B receptor antagonist, but not a CCK-A receptor antagonist, produces an antinociceptive effect in the rat formalin test. This effect of a CCK-B receptor antagonist was not mediated by the spinal opioid receptor activation.",

Both the CCKAR and CCKBR have high affinity for sulfated CCK peptides, while only the CCKBR has high affinity for gastrin peptides. To determine the structural basis for the selectivity of the CCKBR for gastrin, we first constructed a series of CCKB/AR chimeras in which restriction endonuclease-defined segments of the CCKBR were replaced with the corresponding segments of the CCKAR. Chimeras transiently expressed in COS-1 cells were screened for the selective loss of gastrin affinity according to the displacement of 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 binding by gastrin-17-I and CCK-8. The sequence spanning from transmembrane domain III (TM III) to TM V was the only segment that resulted in the selective loss of gastrin affinity. This segment could account for 100 of the expected 300-fold lower affinity of gastrin-17-I observed for the control CCKAR compared to the control CCKBR. Using site-directed mutagenesis in this segment of the CCKBR, we identified a sequence of 5 amino acids in the second extracellular loop responsible for this 100-fold selective loss in gastrin affinity. 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 binding displacement by L365,260 (a CCKBR selective antagonist) was unaffected by the changes in these 5 amino acids. These results present for the first time the identification of the amino acid sequence of the CCKBR conferring the majority of the selectivity for gastrin.",

However, naloxone alone had a significant proconflict effect, and beta-funaltrexamine alone tended to produce a proconflict effect. Spontaneous drinking behavior was not affected by treatment with diazepam and nor-binaltorphimine. In addition, nor-binaltorphimine had no effect on diazepam-induced motor incoordination, hypothermia or anticonvulsant action, respectively.

    "82": "The effects of loreclezole on the function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex in rat cerebral cortical membrane preparations were compared with those of propofol and diazepam. Loreclezole and propofol modulated [3H]muscimol binding and t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to washed and unwashed membranes with potencies and efficacies greater than those of diazepam. Loreclezole and propofol enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding to washed membranes with efficacies lower than those of GABA and muscimol. Both loreclezole and propofol showed biphasic effects on [35S]TBPS binding to washed membranes: at low concentrations (5 to 10 microM), both drugs, with different efficacies, enhanced [35S]TBPS binding whereas, at higher concentrations (30 to 100 microM), they inhibited this biochemical parameter. In contrast, diazepam enhanced [35S]TBPS binding to washed membranes at all concentrations tested. The combination of loreclezole with GABA, at a concentration (0.3 microM) that only slightly increased [35S]TBPS binding to washed membranes, reversed the increase in binding elicited by loreclezole (5 to 10 microM) and significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect exerted by higher concentrations (30 to 100 microM) of this drug. Similar effects were observed with the combination of GABA and propofol. However, GABA had no effect on the enhancement of [35S]TBPS binding induced by diazepam. The ability of GABA to reverse and potentiate the effects of loreclezole and propofol on [35S]TBPS binding to washed membranes was shared by pentobarbital (200 microM) and alphaxalone (3 microM). These anesthetics showed greater efficacies in combination with pentobarbital (200 microM) and alphaxalone (3 microM). These anesthetics showed greater efficacies in combination with propofol than with loreclezole. These results suggest that, unlike diazepam, loreclezole and propofol may activate the receptor-associated Cl- channel in the absence of GABA. Furthermore, the difference in the pharmacological profiles of loreclezole and propofol may result from their different effectiveness in activating the receptor Cl- channel directly.",

Binding of [3H]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxa mide ([3H]PK-11195), a specific ligand of PBRs, to islet membranes was saturable and Scatchard's analysis of saturation curve demonstrated the presence of a single population of binding sites, with a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 4.75 +/- 0.70 nM and a maximum amount of specifically bound ligand (Bmax) of 4505 +/- 502 fmol/mg of proteins. The pharmacological profile of PBRs was determined as the ability of PK-11195 and several benzodiazepine compounds to displace [3H]PK-11195 from these binding sites. The rank order of potency yielded the following affinity results: PK-11195 > 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-(p-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2 -on (Ro 5-4864) > diazepam > or = flunitrazepam > flumazenil.

Response to a submaximal dose of gastrin (50 nM) was dose-dependently blocked by the CCKB-receptor antagonists CAM-1028 (4-[[2-[[3-(1 H-indol-3-yl)-2-methyl-1-oxo-2-[[[1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2, 2,1]hept-2-yl)oxy]carbonyl]amino]propyl]amino]-1-phenylethyl]amino-4-oxo -[1 S-1 alpha, 2 beta [S'(S')4 alpha]]-butanoate-N-methyl-D-glucamine) (IC50 1.9 nM), L-365,260 (3 R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1 H-1, 4-benzodiazepin-3-yl)-N'-(3-methylphenyl)urea) (IC50 10 nM) and spiroglumide ((R)-4-(3,5-dichlorobenzamido)-5-(8-azaspiro[4.5]decan -8-yl)-5-oxopentanoic acid) (IC50 2 microM). The results were in agreement with those obtained from binding studies in guinea-pig cortical membranes. The model was employed to optimize the synthesis of a new class of spiroglumide analogues which led to a new molecule, (S)-4-\u00bf(R)-4'-(3,5-dichlorobenzoylamino)-5'-(8-azaspiro[4.5] decan-8-yl)-5'-oxo)-pentanoylamino-5-(1-naphthylamino)-5-oxo pentanoic acid (CR 2622), whose potency was about 100-fold greater than that of spiroglumide. CR 2622, as well as the other CCKB receptor antagonists tested, exhibited no effect on basal [Ca2+]i. The simplicity and the reproducibility of this method suggest that it is a useful model to screen gastrin and antigastrin activity in parallel or as an alternative to binding studies.", 
    "85": "The effect of camostate, a potent releaser of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK), and of caerulein, an amphibian peptide mimicking the biological actions of CCK, as well as of selective CCK receptor antagonists on gastric emptying of liquids was studied in the rat. Oral administration of camostate (200 mg/kg with the liquid test meal preceded by the same dose 10 min before the meal) significantly delayed gastric emptying of saline, an effect which was completely blocked by previous administration of the CCKA receptor antagonist, devazepide, at a dose (1 mg/kg i.v.) unable to modify the emptying rate when administered alone. Caerulein (0.03-30 nmol/kg i.v.) also delayed the emptying rate in a dose-dependent manner, with an ID50 of 3.94 nmol/kg. The effect of the peptide was also inhibited by devazepide. The CCKB receptor antagonist, L365,260 (3R-(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1, 4-benzodiazepine-3-yl)-N'-(3-methylphenyl)-urea; 3 mg/kg i.v.), was completely unable to modify the CCK (both endogenous and exogenous)-induced delay in gastric emptying. Repeated (7 days) camostate administration did not modify the gastric motor response to endogenous CCK, thus, suggesting that adaptation did not take place. These results demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous CCK delays gastric emptying of liquids through stimulation of CCKA receptors and suggest that adaptation of the gastric motor response to CCK does not occur.", 
    "86": "The gamma 2 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptor is associated with the actions of benzodiazepines and related drugs. A phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligodeoxynucleotide directed against the gamma 2 subunit was given by i.c.v. injection (18 micrograms in 2 microliters saline) to male Sprague-Dawley rats every 12 h for 3 days. Controls received the corresponding sense oligodeoxynucleotide. 4-6 h after the last i.c.v. treatment, rats were given methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), a benzodiazepine \"inverse agonist', by slow i.v. infusion. Compared to naive rats, the beta-CCM threshold dose was not affected by the sense oligodeoxynucleotide, but was increased 87% in antisense oligodeoxynucleotide-treated rats. The treatment had no effect on the seizure threshold for picrotoxin. Both antisense and sense oligodeoxynucleotide treatments slightly increased the threshold for strychnine seizures. The results suggest that antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment altered GABAA receptor composition and interfered with the actions of a benzodiazepine receptor ligand in vivo, and may provide a tool for studying regulation of receptor structure and function.", 
    "87": "The object of this study was to grade the response of patients undergoing a variety of dental procedures with the aid of intravenous midazolam sedation in general dental practice and to explore any relationships between the patients preoperative anxiety assessment and the clinician's assessment of co-operation whilst under sedation. One hundred consecutive patients aged between 18 and 58 years (mean 32 years; sd 10 years) and in ASA Class I or II were prospectively studied. Results showed that despite attempts to grade patient's behaviour it was not possible to reliably predict patient's responses under intravenous sedation. In addition to these findings, the great individual variation in sensitivity to midazolam was confirmed.", 
    "88": "A gas chromatographic method for the sensitive determination of midazolam in plasma volumes as low as 40 microliters was developed, utilizing clinazolam as the internal standard. After liquid-liquid extraction at basic pH into 1-chlorobutane-dichloromethane (96:4) a 2- to 4-microliters portion of the reconstituted extract was injected under electronic pressure control onto a 12 m x 0.2 mm I.D. methyl silicone capillary column, and was exposed to a three-step temperature program from 120 to 310 degrees C, to separate the analytes from the plasma constituents. The compound of interest was identified and quantified by means of a mass-selective detector. The assay was linear from 10 to 500 ng/ml using 40 microliters of plasma (limit of quantification: 10 ng/ml) and was linear from 0.25 to 100 ng/ml using 500 microliters of plasma (limit of quantification: 0.25 ng/ml). The intra-day precision for the 40-microliters aliquots varied from 2.2 to 6.6%, the corresponding accuracy from -7.4 to -4.4%; the inter-day precision ranged from 5 to 7.2% and the corresponding accuracy from -7.2 to -5.1%.", 
    "89": "A method for the determination of trace amounts of triazolam in serum by deactivated metal capillary gas chromatography with electron-capture detection was established. The column used exhibits excellent thermostability in high-temperature analysis and easy handling and a long lifetime of the column and well shaped peaks on the chromatograms are obtained. With the metal capillary column, it was found to be easier to maintain suitable analytical conditions for the routine assay of triazolam than with a fused-silica column. With this method, 0.5 ng/ml of triazolam in serum can be determined. The method is useful for pharmacokinetic and therapeutic purposes.", 
    "90": "The green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps) \"muscarinic toxin', MT1, was radioiodinated by the chloramine T method. 125I-MT1 labelled the muscarinic M1 receptor subtype with a very good selectivity in rat brain. It had no preference for the receptor states with high or low affinity for agonists, and was not affected by Gpp(NH)p addition to the incubation medium. The 125I-MT1 binding was reversible, with a half life of 45 min at 25 degrees C. The effect of competitive and allosteric muscarinic antagonists on 125I-MT1 binding and dissociation can be rationalized by assuming that the radioiodinated toxin is able to label the muscarinic (acetylcholine) binding site.", 
    "91": "The spinal cord dorsal horn contains neural mechanisms which can greatly facilitate pain. It is well established that excitatory amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, are involved in the spinal transmission of nociceptive information and in the development of hyperalgesia. In the present study, intrathecal (i.t.) administration of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA), a structural analog of L-glutamate, produced a dose-dependent behavioural syndrome characterized by caudally directed biting in mice. We demonstrated that peripheral pre-administration of the AMPA receptor antagonists 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX, 10-100 mg/kg s.c.) and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-7, 8-methylene-dioxy-5H-2,3-benzo-diazepine-HCl (GYKI 53655, 3-10 mg/kg s.c.), and also of the NMDA receptor antagonist 5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine maleate (MK 801, 0.3-1 mg/kg s.c.) reversed this effect. These findings suggest that the hyperalgesia induced by the i.t. injection of AMPA in mice involves the activation of both NMDA and non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptor sites.", 
    "92": "The time course of the discriminative stimulus effects of a benzodiazepine partial agonist, bretazenil, and a benzodiazepine full agonist, chlordiazepoxide, were determined in rats after administration of two doses of either drug. As in man, bretazenil was considerably shorter-acting than chlordiazepoxide, with 0% drug-appropriate responding at the 2-h time point after the training dose of 7 mg/kg and < 20% drug-appropriate responding at 9 h after the 14 mg/kg dose. With chlordiazepoxide, responding on the water-appropriate lever did not occur in all rats until 7 h after administration of the training dose of 7 mg/kg, compared to 17 h after administration of 14 mg/kg. Although there was considerable individual variability with both drugs, it would appear that the drug discrimination procedure can be a valuable tool for studying the time course of the interoceptive effects of psychoactive drugs.", 
    "93": "We investigated whether somatostain modulates the generation of long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat perforant path-dentate gyrus synapse in vivo. When somatostatin was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) 20 min prior to the tetanus, the intensity of LTP increased dose dependently. Synaptic potential evoked by a low-frequency test stimulation, however, was not altered by somatostatin. We next tested whether the LTP-augmenting effect of somatostain is mediated by cholinergic activation, because somatostatin was demonstrated to promote acetylcholine release in rat hippocampal slice. Pirenzepine (50 nmol/rat), a muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, did not affect the tetanus-induced LTP by itself. But when it was co-applicated with the somatostatin (50 ng/rat) 20 min before tetanus, it completely abolished the LTP-augmenting effect of somatostatin. Then we examined the effect of octreotide, a potent agonist specifically binding to somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 4, on the generation of LTP. Octreotide (500 ng/rat) also facilitated the intensity of LTP. These results suggest that somatostatin facilitates the generation of perforant path-dentate gyrus granule cell LTP by activating the muscarinic cholinergic receptor and the effect of somatostatin is induced, at least partly, by somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 4 in vivo.", 
    "94": "The vagus is a mixed nerve containing cholinerrgic and non-cholinergic neurons. Vagal fibers interact with peptidergic neurons of the enteric nervous system which stain immunohistochemically for cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and gastrin releasing peptide. The contribution of these peptidergic neurons in the pancreatic response to vagal stimulation is unknown. We tested the effect of specific inhibitor of these stimulants against vagally mediated exocrine secretion in rats. The response to vagal stimulation was blocked significantly by each of the following: the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (100% inhibition); the muscarinic, cholinergic blocker atropine (85% inhibition); the specific cholecystokinin-A receptor blocker (91% inhibition); and a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide polyclonal antibody (89% inhibition). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that potentiating interactions among several agonists mediate the vagal response. Our study, however, dose not exclude acetylcholine as the final common mediator.", 
    "95": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the best clinical use of Flumazenil, a specific antagonist of benzodiazepines, during endoscopic exams. Two-hundred patients were studied: 120 were treated with Flumazenil and 80 with placebo. The patients were prepared for the endoscopic exam with local anaesthesia and i.v. Diazepam administration. Controls performed at the end of the exam and at 5, 30, 120 e 240 minutes from the administration of Flumazenil and placebo, allowed to evaluate the state of awakeness, the level of conscience and the capacity of time-space orientation. Significantly statistical differences between the two groups were obtained at 5, 30 and 120 minutes after Flumazenil administration, while both groups had retrograde amnesia. The drug was well tolerated and there were no undesiderable side effects or reactions. The Authors therefore affirm that Flumazenil, in virtue of its competitive action toward benzodiazepine receptors, interrupts sedation with immediate awakening and improvement of the state of consciousness. Such drug, thus, permits the Day Hospital performance of endoscopic procedures which otherwise would require hospitalization, at the same time allowing the surgeon to use benzodiazepines at doses more adequate for surgical necessities.", 
    "96": "In this study we demonstrate that IgG present in the sera of patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (PSS) could bind and activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) of rat parotid gland. These antibodies were able to inhibit in a non-competitive manner the binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to mAChRs of purified rat parotid gland membranes. Moreover, IgG from PSS could modify biological effects mediated by mAChR activation; i.e. decrease cAMP, increase phosphoinositide turnover without affecting cGMP. Atropine and 4-DAMP blocked all of these effects, and carbachol mimicked them, confirming the M3 subtype mAChRs mediated PSS IgG action. Neither binding nor biological effect were obtained with IgG from sera of normal women. The prevalence of cholinergic antibody was 100% in PSS, and was independent of Ro/SS-A and La/SS-B antibodies. It could be concluded that antibody against mAChRs may be another serum factor to be considered in the pathophysiology of the development of PSS.", 
    "97": "We present a case of benign paradoxical vocal cord adduction' presenting to the emergency department as acute stridor. This patient received direct laryngoscopy at initial presentation documenting inspiratory vocal cord adduction. The syndrome is not well known to emergency physicians and, because it often mimics life-threatening airway compromise, prompt recognition of the benign nature of this syndrome may avert more aggressive airway interventions such as beta agonists, steroids, endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy. Successful treatment has included relaxation, sedatives and speech therapy to abort the acute attack and prevent further recurrence. As direct flexible laryngoscopy is more readily available in the emergency department, goals for the future are more rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of this benign syndrome.", 
    "98": "We present our results of intermittent prophylaxis with oral diazepam in febrile seizures. We treated 82 patients aged between 3 months and 5 years. They have had simple or complex febrile seizures. Recurrence occurred in 22 patients (26%), none had a long-lasting febrile convulsion. Transient side effects occurred in 21.95% of the cases. We conclude that diazepam is a safe and effective drug for prophylaxis of febrile seizures when used as soon as any sign of illness appears. We suggest, however, that the administration of the drug should be indicated if the child presents at least one consistent predictor of risk of recurrent febrile seizures.",

    "100": "The therapy of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is very heterogeneous with more than 100 drug combinations. This results from differently qualified physicians and from insufficient pharmacostudies concerning evaluation and psychopathological methodology of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The following advices can be given: Physical withdrawal should take place under the conditions of an appropriate hospital with a qualified team. The application of electrolytes and vitamines (B1) may be necessary in alcohol addicts. Less severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes are treated sufficiently with carbamazepine, sometimes it can be necessary to combine it with neuroleptics or benzodiazepines. A secure prevention from delirium tremens and its treatment is only guaranteed by clomethiazole or benzodiazepines. To reduce the doses of those drugs, combinations with neuroleptics are possible. In general voluntary physical withdrawal proves only to be successful if longtime abstinence is planned and a motivation program is setup the for withdrawal treatment.",

The authors describe two clinical cases of lipomatous hypertrophy and underline usefulness of multiplane transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of this affection.", 
    "102": "Social phobia has been recognized as a discrete diagnostic condition only relatively recently. Epidemiological studies have shown that social phobia is associated with significant impairment and an increasing body of evidence has now indicated that pharmacological treatment is effective. Placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine. A reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, moclobemide, is better tolerated and safer than the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors and placebo-controlled studies have also demonstrated efficacy for this compound; moreover, positive results from a small study of brofaromine also support the efficacy of this class of compounds. It has been reported that a high-potency benzodiazepine, clonazepam, is effective but there is little placebo-controlled evidence to support the use of other benzodiazepines. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also being tested in social phobia with encouraging results. More studies are now needed on the long-term treatment of social phobia.", 
    "103": "Social phobia has been recognized only recently as a clinical entity, and there is considerable overlap in diagnosis between agoraphobia, panic disorder, stress disorder and avoidant (anxious) personality disorder. In more severe cases there may also be some difficulty in differentiating the condition from schizophrenia. In reaching a correct diagnosis of social phobia it appears that the two essential elements of a phobic diagnosis, situational fear and avoidance, should be present prominently and that a distinction from agoraphobia can be made by paying close attention to the nature of the situations in which fear is shown. If this policy is followed, social phobia can be readily defined and is fairly easily distinguished from other neurotic disorders. There is considerable overlap with the anxious and fearful group of personality disorders, particularly avoidant (anxious) personality disorder and this is almost impossible to distinguish from chronic persisting social phobia. Data are presented on the incidence of primary and secondary social phobia occurring prospectively in patients with the most common neurotic disorders (dysthymia, panic and generalized anxiety disorder) seen over a 2-year period. Twelve per cent of the patients had secondary social phobia initially, but over the 2-year period 9% of the patients had social phobia as a primary or single psychiatric diagnosis on at least one occasion. This was most likely in those patients allocated to a benzodiazepine, diazepam, in the first phase of treatment (p < 0.05).", 
    "104": "Shiftworkers working on the night shift transpose their sleeping hours to the time of day which is inconvenient for sleep because of the endogenous circadian rhythm sleep wakefulness, the circadian rhythms of other body functions and the environmental schedule. As a result of this, a certain number of workers suffer from insomnia. This study aimed at examining the effects of two hypnotic agents with different elimination times on sleep disturbances which follow night shift work. Three groups of shiftworkers took zopiclone, nitrazepam and placebo capsules during a week of work on the night shift repeating it three times so that each week of capsule taking was separated from the next by a three-week break. In the two groups on hypnotics total length and efficacy of main sleep improved as did the efficacy of all day sleeps at the very beginning of the week, and these sleep characteristics persisted throughout the week. In contrast, in the group which took a placebo sleep was shorter and loss efficacious at the beginning but improved towards the end of the week. There was no negative effect of hypnotics on the shiftworker's mood after waking up. To an extent, the hypnotics proved to be useful for periodical pharmacological improvement of the length and efficacy of day sleep after night work in the slowly rotating shift system.", 
    "105": "To clarify the involvement of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) and CYP2C19 in the metabolism of alprazolam, the effects of pretreatment with erythromycin, which is an inhibitor of CYP3A and S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation capacity on the single-oral dose kinetics of alprazolam were studied in 12 healthy male volunteers. Six each were extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) of S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation. Each subject received erythromycin 1,200 mg/day or placebo for 10 days in a double-blind, crossover manner. At 9 AM of day 8 alprazolam 0.8 mg was given orally, and blood samplings were performed up to 48 hours postdosing. Erythromycin treatment compared with placebo treatment increased significantly plasma alprazolam concentrations from 6 to 48 hours postdosing. Erythromycin significantly decreased the apparent oral clearance and prolonged the elimination half-life of alprazolam. No significant difference was found in plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of alprazolam between the EM and PM groups. The present study thus suggests that CYP3A, but not CYP2C19, is involved in the metabolism of alprazolam.", 
    "106": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 on consumption of either a 1% sucrose solution or a 0.1% sodium saccharin solution in nondeprived male rats was examined. A video-recording approach was adopted in which licks were counted in a frame-by-frame analysis. Ro 15-4513 (1-10 mg/kg) caused a significant decrease in the intake of both sucrose and saccharin solutions that was associated with a reduction in the initial rate of licking. There was a decrease in the total duration of drinking, total licks, and number of bouts for both sucrose and saccharin. For sucrose, mean bout duration was significantly reduced, although this was not so for saccharin. Intrabout lick rate, the latency to engage in drinking, and the postdrinking time were not affected for either sucrose or saccharin. These data are consistent with previous evidence that strongly suggests that benzodiazepines influence palatability.", 
    "107": "1. The antilesion actions of two antimuscarinic drugs on ethanol-induced gastric injury and mucosal integrity were examined in male rats. Histological examinations were made and gastric emptying rates determined after in vivo administration of the drugs to conscious rats. In anaesthetized rats, with an ex vivo gastric chamber, effects on gastric transmucosal potential difference, Evan's blue leakage and Na+ output were examined. 2. In conscious animals, atropine (1 mgkg-1, i.p.) and pirenzepine (1 mgkg-1, i.p.) both significantly reduced macroscopic lesion formation, but not microscopic damage and functional alterations, caused by orally administered absolute ethanol. Moreover, these drugs did not show any effect on the basal gastric adherent mucus level, nor the depleting action of ethanol on both adherent mucus and the mucosal mucus layer. Nevertheless, both atropine and pirenzepine significantly reduced gastric emptying rate. 3. In anaesthetized animals, pirenzepine but not atropine increased the basal transmucosal potential difference (PD); however, it could not prevent the ethanol-induced drop in PD. Furthermore, the inhibitory action of ethanol on sodium ion output from the gastric mucosa was not attenuated by these drugs. Pirenzepine, however, significantly lessened the increase in vascular permeability caused by 100% ethanol. This action was not shared by atropine. 4. These findings indicate that both atropine and pirenzepine exert their antilesion actions through the relaxation of the stomach. Pirenzepine also preserves the integrity of the gastric mucosal vasculature, which is distinct from the action of atropine. The protective action of these drugs occurs only at the macroscopic level.", 
    "108": "The pharmacodynamic properties of meloxicam, a new nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), that go beyond those typical of an NSAID were examined. The extent to which meloxican shows NSAID-like interactions with paracetamol, pirenzepine, chlorthalidone, phenprocoumon and tolbutamide was also investigated. In the dose range studied, meloxicam had no influence on the blood pressure of the unanaesthetized rat, blood flow, heart rate, ECG and respiratory minute volume of the anaesthetized cat or on the blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory minute volume of the anaesthetized dog. The acute toxicity level of meloxicam after oral and parenteral administration to the rat and mouse proved considerably lower than that of indomethacin. Meloxicam showed excellent tissue tolerability following parenteral administration. The effects against inflammatory pain and acute antiexudative effects of meloxicam were enhanced by simultaneous low doses of paracetamol. Pirenzepine showed an antagonistic effect on the ulcerogenicity of meloxicam in the rat stomach. The diuretic effect of chlorthalidone in the rat was not influenced by high doses of meloxicam. The effect of phenprocoumon in the rat was enhanced by high doses of meloxicam. However, the hypoglycaemic effect of tolbutamide in the rabbit was not influenced by meloxicam.", 
    "109": "We studied the effects of diazepam, CL 218,872, Ro 15-1788, beta-CCM and Ro 15-4513 on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated current in adult and newborn rat superior cervical ganglion neurons. Diazepam (10-1,000 nmol/l) potentiated the current in a concentration-dependent manner. CL 218,872 was less effective and weaker than diazepam. The other ligands reduced the amplitude of the current. These peripheral receptors might be involved in some of the side effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "110": "Many patients with periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) display inadequate sleep hygiene, and others decline conventional pharmacologic intervention for their form of sleep disturbance. Nonetheless, the use of nonpharmacologic therapies with PLMD remains unexplored. The current study was designed to compare the short-term treatment effects of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and conventional pharmacotherapy (clonazepam) among a group of insomniacs with PLMD. The 16 subjects participating in this study first underwent baseline assessment procedures, including completion of a sleep log for 2 weeks, an ambulatory polysomnogram (APSG) and an Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ). They then were randomized either to CBT (n = 8) or standard clonazepam therapy (n = 8). Subjects maintained sleep logs throughout a 4-week treatment and then completed a second APSG and ISQ. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment data suggested that the two treatments led to equal improvements in sleep log measures of sleep-wake times and ISQ measures of subjective sleep concerns. Patients treated with CBT showed a decrease in daytime napping, whereas the clonazepam group reported increased napping. Conversely, those treated with clonazepam showed larger declines in periodic limb movement-arousals per hour of sleep than did the CBT group. Post-treatment interviews suggested that both CBT and clonazepam therapies were generally well tolerated by study participants. It is concluded that both treatments may be useful for PLMD but that the two treatments may have contrasting effects across selected measures of improvement. Additional research is needed to examine the long-term efficacy of CBT as a primary or adjunctive treatment for varying levels of PLMD severity.",

    "113": "Thirty-six patients were diagnosed after the onset of neurological disease (symptomatic group), twenty-one before (presymptomatic group). Carnitine levels were found to be reduced in all patients at diagnosis. In the symptomatic group, macrocephaly had been present around birth and was followed by rapid postnatal head growth in 70% of the children. The patients often showed symptoms such as hypotonia, irritability, and jitteriness followed by an acute encephalopathic crisis occurring on average at 12 months of age. Common neuroimaging findings included frontotemporal atrophy, subependymal pseudocysts, delayed myelination, basal ganglia atrophy, chronic subdural effusions and hematomas. In four patients the latter two findings were initially misinterpreted as resulting from child abuse. Other important misdiagnoses in older siblings who were affected and went undiagnosed include postencephalitic cerebral palsy, dystonic cerebral palsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Metabolic treatment did not convincingly improve the neurological disease, although it may have prevented further deterioration. Symptomatic treatment with baclofen or benzodiazepines was effective in reducing muscle spasms. Children in the presymptomatic group were diagnosed because of familiarity for the disease (n = 13), macrocephaly and/or additional minor neurological signs in infancy (n = 6), or acute encephalopathy, which was fully reversible after prompt treatment (n = 2). After diagnosis, all children were treated with oral carnitine, fluid infusion during intercurrent illnesses and, in addition, a diet was started in 13 of the 21 children. All 21 children except one (born prematurely at 31 weeks) have continued to develop normally up to now. Mean age at report is 6.3 years with a range from 6 months to 14.8 years. In older patients, the neuroradiological changes, present in infancy as in the symptomatic patients, became less prominent and in one girl disappeared.", 
    "114": "In presymptomatic children with GDD, the onset of neurological disease can be prevented by vigorous treatment of catabolic crises during illnesses together with carnitine supplementation. The importance of dietary therapy remains unclear and needs further evaluation. The potential treatability of GDD calls for increased attention to early presenting signs in order to recognize the disorder and to initiate treatment before the onset of irreversible neurological disease.", 
    "115": "Recently we developed a novel imaging technique using positron emitter-labeled compounds as probes and a storage phosphor screen as a detector. This approach makes it possible to follow a variety of biochemical processes with spatial information in living brain slices. Further technical development is reported here in terms of time-resolved imaging and receptor characterization in a real equilibrium state. The method was validated by use of [11C]Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Fresh brain slices were incubated with [11C]Ro15-1788 in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution at 37 degrees C, in a specially designed chamber. By placing the chamber on a storage phosphor screen, we could obtain two-dimensional images of radioactivity in the slices. Time-resolved imaging was made at 5 min intervals, revealing that it took 60 min to reach equilibrium binding. The dissociation process was observed by adding an excess amount of unlabeled Ro15-1788 to the chamber, 25 min was required for the full dissociation. In the equilibrium state, i.e. in the presence of free radio-ligand, Scatchard plot analysis was performed on the cerebral cortex (Kd = 7.4 nM, Bmax = 146 fmol/mg tissue) and striatum (Kd = 7.5 nM, Bmax = 107 fmol/mg tissue), suggesting the presence of a single component of binding site in these two regions. The present method, for the first time, made it possible to study a ligand-receptor interaction in living brain slices with temporal and spatial resolutions. This technique should prove useful for studies of receptor function under physiological conditions.", 
    "116": "In the rat, paradoxical sleep (PS) is preceded by a short-lasting stage characterized by high amplitude cortical spindles and low frequency hippocampal theta rhythm. This intermediate stage (IS) is massively extended at the expense of PS by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. To further study the relationship between the IS and PS, six rats were PS deprived for 48 h by sitting on one of three small platforms surrounded by water. A control group of six other rats remained in dry cages with shavings. After 24 h PS deprivation the latency of IS occurrence increased, was unchanged after 48 h deprivation and decreased during recovery on shavings after 52 h deprivation. The total IS duration, number of episodes and mean duration per episode were unchanged during deprivation but increased during recovery. This recovery was characterized by an increase in the number of PS episodes and the total duration while the latency of PS occurrence decreased. The frequency of theta rhythm, unchanged for PS, increased for the IS during deprivation and recovery. In conclusion, the IS did not substitute for PS after selective deprivation.", 
    "117": "General principles for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders include reevaluation of diagnosis, search for hidden comorbidity, and systematic trials of alternative treatments and treatment combinations. For the combination of refractory depression and substance abuse, alternative approaches to both problems need to be tried, as suggested in the decision tree in Figure 1. Recognition of a previously unappreciated substance abuse problem or institution of more effective substance abuse treatment (see Table 2) can improve the outcome of depression. Hospitalization is often useful to enforce abstinence and to clarify the diagnosis of depression, and is particularly indicated if substance abuse is severe. If hospitalization is not possible then features of the history, such as relative onsets of depression and substance abuse, can be considered to support the diagnosis. TCAs and SSRIs have been studied in depressed substance abusers and should be the first lines of treatment. If these fail, other medications, medication combinations, or ECT should be considered, extrapolating from the general literature on treatment of refractory depression. In general, single agents should be preferred to combinations, as this reduces the odds of drug-drug interactions in patients who may abuse a variety of substances. Impairment by antidepressant agents of hepatic metabolism of other drugs should be considered, and sertraline, for example, might be preferred over fluoxetine for this reason. For each case, the known side effects and risks of a given antidepressant medication must be considered in the context of a patient's substance abuse pattern and medical problems. Such risk:benefit analyses are often difficult, as illustrated in the cases presented. Finally, although it is a rare occurrence, antidepressant medications that are anticholinergic or amphetamine-like may be abused, and this needs to be monitored. Alcohol or drug abuse history is a likely risk factor for benzodiazepine abuse, and benzodiazepines should, therefore, be avoided or used with caution. These recommendations for management of treatment-resistant depression with substance abuse are based upon clinical experience and extrapolation from the literature on treatment-resistant depression, treatment of substance abuse, and initial treatment of depression in substance abusers with TCAs and SSRIs. More treatment research is needed, particularly on Type IV patients where both depression and substance use are treatment resistant.", 
    "118": "(+)-Limonene (d-limonene) and related monoterpenes show chemopreventive activity against rodent mammary carcinoma and inhibit the growth of cancer cells in vitro. One suggested mechanism for the anti-tumorigenic effect of (+)-limonene is inhibition of the post-translational isoprenylation of growth controlling Ras oncoproteins. We have here examined the growth inhibitory effect of (+)-limonene and other related monoterpenes on PANC-1 pancreas carcinoma cells (carrying a K-ras mutation) and on 12V-H-ras-transformed rat fibroblasts. (+)- and (-)-perillyl alcohol, 7-methyl-perillyl alcohol, (+)-limonene oxide and (+)-perillic acid methyl ester were all found to efficiently inhibit cell growth at 1 mM, whereas (+)-limonene caused an approximately 50% growth reduction at 5 mM. Whereas BZA-5B, an inhibitor of Ras farnesyl transferase, was found to induce morphological reversion of 12V-H-ras-transformed cells, (+)-perillyl alcohol and (+)-limonene did not induce reversion. Furthermore, monoterpenes did not decrease MAP kinase enzyme activity or collagenase promoter activity in PANC-1 cells, two functions known to be down-stream from Ras. We conclude that although effective in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells harboring activated ras oncogenes, limonene and (+)-perillyl alcohol are unlikely to act by inhibiting Ras function.", 
    "119": "The intensity of putative benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms was evaluated as part of a double blind placebo-controlled study of benzodiazepines and behaviour therapy in the management of agoraphobia. During the first phase of that study, some subjects were switched from low dose diazepam to placebo, and others remained on diazepam. Symptoms were evaluated in long-term benzodiazepine users (n = 30) and non-users n = 32) when they first entered the study and 4 weeks later, after both groups had been randomized to either diazepam or placebo, using eight analog rating scales measuring commonly reported withdrawal symptoms. At baseline, both users and non-users reported a substantial number of symptoms, with higher levels in the more anxious patients, but no differences between groups. After the transition to either diazepam or placebo, the users switched to placebo reported significantly higher levels of symptoms than users switched to diazepam and non-users combined. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the increase in symptoms was associated with the increase in anxiety, which was higher in the withdrawing group than the other three groups. These results raise questions concerning the extent to which withdrawal symptoms uniquely characterize benzodiazepine withdrawal. They confirm the common assumption that an increase in symptoms often accompanies withdrawal from benzodiazepines, but suggest that such symptoms are not so intense as to make withdrawal excessively difficult, at least in low-dose users.", 
    "120": "An in vitro/in vivo study was carried out with different rectal formulations of temazepam. Pharmacokinetic data were determined in a cross-over study in 10 volunteers after rectal administration of 10 mg temazepam as a polyethylene glycol based suppository (selected from in vitro data), a liquid-filled capsule and a micro-enema respectively, using oral administration of a liquid-filled capsule as a reference. Serum levels of temazepam indicate an instantaneous and complete release from the micro-enema (Frel = 0.94 +/- 0.21, Cmax 205 +/- 36.9 micrograms/l, tmax 0.49 +/- 0.31 hour) and a slower but complete release of temazepam from the suppository (Frel = 1.10 +/- 0.25, Cmax 202 +/- 41.3 micrograms/l, tmax 1.48 +/- 0.41 hour). A high interindividual variation in absorption profiles was observed after rectal administration of the liquid-filled capsule (Frel 0.72 +/- 0.36, Cmax 182 +/- 122 micrograms/l, tmax 4.08 +/- 4.28 hour), which makes it less suitable for rectal use. The micro-enema and suppository appear to be useful as rectal formulations for temazepam.", 
    "121": "GABAA agonists do not respond to the same degree to allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor complex such as benzodiazepines. We report there the effects of two steroids (alfaxalone and pregnenolone sulfate) on the inhibition induced by two GABAA agonists, 3-amino propane sulphonic acid (3-APS) and muscimol, on the extracellular evoked potentials obtained in CA1 of mice hippocampi. Alfaxalone (1 microM) potentiates the effects of both agonists, although incubation times longer than 15 minutes are required to potentiate the inhibitory effect of muscimol. Lower doses of pregnenolone sulfate at shorter incubation periods are able to inhibit the effects produced by single doses of 3-APS as compared to muscimol (15 microM during 5 min vs 30 microM during 5 min). Our results confirm the possibility that there might be differences in the interaction between GABAA agonists and modulatory steroids.", 
    "122": "OBJECTIVE- to assess the safety, acceptability, and efficacy of removing bilaterally impacted wisdom teeth as a one-stage rather than a two-stage procedure. DESIGN- randomised controlled trial. Setting - district hospital. SUBJECTS- 100 consecutive patients who required removal of bilaterally impacted third molars. INTERVENTIONS- 50 patients were randomised to have the teeth removed in two stages, 3-4 weeks apart, the other 50 to have the teeth removed at one visit. All operations were done under local anaesthetic (2% lignocaine and 1/80 000 adrenaline) and intravenous midazolam 0.07-0.13 mg/kg titrated against sedative effect individually. Main outcome measures - morbidity, time off work, anxiety scores (assessed by visual analogue scale), and patient opinions. RESULTS- 5 patients were withdrawn because they were not given the randomised treatment, and 10 were lost to follow-up, leaving 40 in the two-stage group and 45 in the one-stage group for analysis. Two patients in the one stage group developed SaO2 of less than 90% which was corrected by deep breathing, and another had a temporary parasthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve that resolved within a week. One patient in the two stage group had a haemorrhage after the first stage that required packing of the socket in the emergency department, and this patient refused to have the second tooth removed. The mean number of days taken off work was significantly less in the one stage group (mean 3 days compared with 5 days (P < 0.005), and the anxiety scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. A quarter of the patients in the two-stage group would have preferred a one-stage procedure, but none in the one-stage group would have preferred a two-stage operation. CONCLUSIONS- removal of bilaterally impacted wisdom teeth under local anaesthesia and sedation in one session is safe, cost effective and acceptable to patients.", 
    "123": "Chiral recognition abilities of a recently developed new type of cellulose phenylcarbamates were studied. These chiral stationary phases (CSPs) simultaneously contain both electron-withdrawing (Cl) and electron-donating (CH3) substituents on the phenyl moiety. Chiral pharmaceuticals which belong to the various pharmacological groups (sedatives, hypnotics, anticonvulsants, Ca2+ channel blockers, beta-blockers, antitusives, antihystaminics, choleretics, diuretics, antimycotics, etc) were resolved to enantiomers. These new CSPs sometimes exhibit alternative chiral recognition ability to that most successful commercially available cellulosic CSP Chiralcel-OD and can be used as a good complement to it in analytical and preparative scale enantioseparations.", 
    "124": "An on-line dialysis-solid-phase extraction-gas chromatographic (GC) approach has been developed for the determination of drugs in plasma, using some benzodiazepines as model compounds. Clean-up is based on performing the dialysis of 100 microliters samples for 7 min using water as acceptor phase and trapping the diffused analytes on a PLRP-S copolymer precolumn. After drying of the precolumn with nitrogen for 15 min, the analytes are desorbed with ethyl acetate (275 microliters) and injected on-line into the GC system via a loop-type interface. The system provides a very efficient clean-up, and offers the possibility of adding chemical agents which can help to reduce drug-protein binding and, thus, increase sensitivity. To demonstrate the potential of the described approach, the determination of benzodiazepines in plasma at their therapeutical levels is used as an example with flame ionization, thermionic and mass-selective detection."
