A multiple, fixed-interval, 2 min fixed-ratio, 15 response schedule of water presentation was used. The three drugs affected fixed-interval fixed-ratio responding in a rate-dependent way, lower rates being more increased whereas higher rates were relatively more decreased. Cyproheptadine increased low response rates to a lesser extent than amphetamine, but increased high response rates that were little affected or only decreased by amphetamine. The combination of cyproheptadine and amphetamine increased response rates to a higher extent than either of the drugs alone. In addition, the rate-suppressant effects of the highest doses of amphetamine were also enhanced by cyproheptadine. These results show that cyproheptadine can increase nonpunished responding and suggest that cyproheptadine and amphetamine act synergistically, but through different mechanisms, upon multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio performance.", 
    "1": "In water-deprived rats and mice, animals trained to the test situation spent more time in drinking than naive animals (first exposure to the test situation). The time spent in drinking, either during 5 min or during 10 min was recorded. As compared to controls, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, meprobamate, and mecloqualone increased drinking time whether the experiments were run on naive or on experienced animals [5 or 10 (in mice) and 9 (in rats) exposures in the test situation]. All drugs were injected i.p. 30 min before testing. This release of the drinking behavior was more pronounced during the last 5 min than during the first 5 min of the 10 min test session. These results suggest that: 1. The inhibition of water intake of naive animals as compared to trained rats and mice, could be related to some emotional factors elicited by the first exposure to an unknown situation. 2. The increase in drinking time induced by the antianxiety drugs in a novel and in a familiar situation seems difficult to correlate only with the antianxiety action of these compounds. 3. Antianxiety drugs could interfere with the regulatory mechanism of thirst.", 
    "2": "The withdrawal of oxazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) applied for 1 year in rats, increased shock-induced aggression of animals. This phenomenon is interpreted as a sign of abstinence and suggests that long-term treatment causes dependence to oxazepam in rats.", 
    "3": "The effects of dopaminergic stimulants on the cyclic GMP content in the medial forebrain and the cerebellum were studied in mice pretreated with dopaminergic antagonists, cholinolytics and agents enhancing GABAergic transmission. Low doses of butyrophenones (haloperidol and spiroperidol) inhibited the rise in cyclic GMP levels and the stereotyped behaviour induced by amphetamine, but were without effect on the same biochemical and behavioural changes elicited by apomorphine. Higher doses effectively blocked the rise in cyclic GMP levels and the stereotyped behaviour elicited by both drugs. These findings suggest that low doses of the dopaminergic antagonists may predominantly act by interfering with the release of dopamine from presynaptic stores, while high doses may act by blockade of the postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor. The rise in cerebellar cyclic GMP levels elicited by dopaminergic stimulants appears not to involve cholinergic transmission, since atropine did not block the effects of the dopaminergic stimulants. Enhancement of GABAergic transmission by diazepam or aminooxyacetic acid antagonized the rise in cerebellar cyclic GMP content induced by the dopaminergic stimulants, but was without effect on the cyclic GMP content in the medial forebrain. Cyclic AMP levels were not affected by any of the drugs in both parts of the brain.", 
    "4": "In five patients who had been on chronic maintenance haemodialysis for more than eight months a syndrome involving altered consciousness, asterixis, and abnormal electroencephalogram developed after they had been given flurazepam and diazepam. All five patients were adequately treated by haemodialysis. Hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac decompensation were not present. The encephalopathy and other abnormalities cleared when the drugs were withdrawn. Symptoms were also produced by accidental rechallenge.", 
    "5": "The behavioral effects of tetrahydroberberine (THB), tetrahydrocoptisine (THC), tetrahydropalmatine (THP) and tetrahydrojateorrhizine (THJ) were compared with those of chlorpromazine (CPZ) and benzodiazepines in mice and rats. Effects of THB were also determined by electroencephalography (EEG) in rabbits. THB was found to pharmacologically exert various actions similar to those of CPZ which is a major tranquilizer, however, the actions of THB were weaker than those of CPZ. Although THB alone did not induce catalepsy, it enhanced the cataleptogenic action of CPZ. At a dose over the effective levels, THB did not lower normal body temperature or induce muscle relaxation and loss of righting reflex. EEG activities in the frontal cortex areas were markedly affected by THB, e.g., fast waves in spontaneous EEG were converted to slow waves. THB and CPZ in a similar manner elicited a sustaining increase in hippocampal afterdischarge, but the action of THB was weaker than that of CPZ. The acute toxicity of THB was lower than that of CPZ and benzodiazepines and the depressant activity of THB almost equalled that of THC and THP, whereas the activity of 1-THB was 1.5 times as great as that of THB. These data indicate that THB, THC and THP may be a new type of tranquilizer.", 
    "6": "Effects of clonazepam, nitrazepam and diazepam on penicillin induced primary, spread and reactive epileptoform discharges were investigated in gallamine immobilized cats. Different strengths of seizure foci were induced by penicillin G 1000, 3000 and 6000 U injected into the cortex, amygdala and intralaminal thalamus, and the spread of epileptic discharges in the subcortex or surrounding area and to the contralateral area was followed. Benzodiazepines 5 mg/kg i.v. shortened the duration of primary epileptoform discharges and prolonged the interictal interval in the cortical, amygdaloid and intralaminal thalamic epileptogenesis induced by a high concentration of penicillin G. When a low concentration of penicillin G was injected into the cortex, amygdala and intralaminal thalamus, benzodiazepines abolished the spread of primary epileptoform discharges and the reactive discharges, but did not suppress completely the primary epileptogenic discharges and the contralateral reflective activity. Suppression of the discharges necessitated administration of a high dose. The greatest degree of suppression was seen with clonazepam. It is concluded that the anticonvulsive effect of benzodiazepines may be due to the blackades of neuronal pathways which spread the seizure discharges from the site of origin (focus) to the effector organ, and the elevation of convulsive thresholds.", 
    "7": "In two adult horses doses of 0.02-0.03 mg/kg diazepam, intravenously, increased 1 hr intake 54-75% above control levels. Intake was stimulated when the diet was a high grain, calorically dense one and also when the diet was a high fiber, calorically dilute one. Two young rapidly growing weanling horses showed an even more pronounced stimulation of intake. Following diazepam 1 hr intake was increased 105-240% above control lelvels. Promazine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg also stimulated intake in adult horses, but not as markedly as did diazepam. A transquilizer and a neuroleptic appear to have a stimulatory eff upon short-term intake in horses.", 
    "8": "To ascertain whether neuroleptics act on the caudate nucleus itself, the effects of these compounds as well as other centrally acting drugs were examined in relation to caudate spindle and EEG arousal responses (sciatic nerve stimulation) in gallamine-immobilized cats. Haloperidol and chlorpromazine enhanced the caudate spindle at a dose which had no effect on the EEG arousal response. On the other hand, clozapine and a higher dose of chlorpromazine enhanced the caudate spindle, but depressed the arousal response. High frequency stimulation of the sciatic nerve suppressed the caudate spindle. Pentobarbital, biperiden and diazepam, while depressing the arousal response, caused an enhancement of the caudate spindle. Imipramine at a low dose had no effect on either response, whereas at a high dose this drug enhanced the caudate spindle with concomitant depression of the arousal response. From these results, it may be concluded that the enhancing action on the caudate spindle induced by haloperidol and a low dose of chlorpromazine is due to an increase in susceptibility of the caudate nucleus itself. In addition, it is suggested that depression of the activating system is involved in an appearance of the caudate spindle.", 
    "9": "Arterial blood gas tensions were measured before and during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, with (group I) and without (group 2) sedation with intravenous diazepam. There was a highly significant fall in the PaO2, which occurred in both groups and was therefore not attributable to diazepam. Measurement of FEV, and FVC before endoscopy had no predictive value for those patients whose PaO2 fell the most.", 
    "10": "At the request of the Service des Haras, our laboratory works on the toxicological problems of the sport-horse. These studies have resulted in the setting up of an anti-doping control for equestrian competitions of various types, not only flat racing. During events, horses, must be calm and docile to the riders' order. Frequently, the latter use tranquillizers to try and win events. The analytical method for the research and identification of these compounds is described. The technique involves successively: 1. alkalinisation of the sample - saliva, blood or urine after enzymatic hydrolysis. 2. extraction with diethyl ether - the recovery is 70% to 90% depending upon the drug. 3. determination by gas-liquid chromatography with use of a retention index for qualitative analysis. We can detect up to fifteen tranquillizers in any one sample, even when present at such low concentrations as found in saliva. The use of the retention index is a reliable method for qualitative analysis. For example, the method has been used for three years, during which period the rentention index of acetylpromazine remained at 3240 +/- 7. The chromatographic analysis was performed on 3% OV-17 at 290 degrees. The chromatographic analysis has been performed by three columns of different polarity (OV-1; OV-17; SP-2250). If on the three columns, the retention index of one peak is the same as that of the tranquilizer, a further confirmation is made with the use of a thermionic detector specific for nitrogenous drugs. In conclusion, this method which is sufficiently precise and specific has been used for anti-doping control.", 
    "11": "Chlorpromazine (12.5 and 25 mg/70 kg, i.m.) and chlordiazepoxide (25 and 50 mg/70 kg, i.m.) were compared with morphine (15 and 30 mg/70 kg, i.m.) and placebo in their effects on electric shock-induced increases in basal skin conductance. Morphine and chlorpromazine attenuated the increase compared with placebo, while chlordiazepoxide did not. None of the treatments produced reliable effects on the phasic responses to the stimuli.", 
    "12": "The existence of several very impressive spinal paroxysms after lumbar myelography with Dimer-X1 caused us to make a retrospective investigation of 327 patients with 355 myelographies. In 7.1% of the investigations we have found partly heavy, but mostly reversible neurological complications. The latter cannot be classified, contrary to prevailing statements, in spinal, meningeal or cerebral reactions, since mostly all 3 anatomical structures are being concerned. Corresponding casuistical information are being presented and with their neurological symptomatic discussed. The spinal paroxysms appeared approximately 6 hours after the myelography and lasted over 8-10 hours, in spite of intensive therapeutical efforts. The pathogenesis points to a multifactorial occurrence caused by the coincidence of an increased dosage of the contrast media, too bed rest time, rising of the contrast media in the spinal cord zone and disturbed liquor fluid circulation and contrast media resorption. Pathophysiologically is in connection with spinal cramps an epileptic mechanism probable. Additional spinal reflexive components could be an explanation for the little therapeutical effect of Diacepam (Valium), which is contrary to the statement in the literature. We have seen a better effect in particular cases with Phenothiazine. With strict observance of specific precautionary measures, the Dimer-X seems to be a good media for the presentation of the lumbar subarachnoid space. A further development in this field is desirable.", 
    "13": "Diazepam (DZP) pretreatment (100mg/kg, ip) of rats 6 h before pentobarbital administration (45 mg/kg, ip) prolonged the barbiturate-induced narcosis. The concentrations of [14C]pentobarbital and total pentobarbital derivatives in blood or brain showed no differences between control and DZP-pretreated animals. The brain and blood concentrations of pentobarbital, when measured at a time corresponding to the respective arousal times from pentobarbital narcosis, were lower in the DZP-pretreated group. These results indicate that acute DZP pretreatment increases the sensitivity of the rat brain to pentobarbital rather than inducing changes in the disposition of the barbiturate.", 
    "14": "The influence of sedative, anaesthetic and neuromuscular blocking drugs on diagnostic urethral pressure profiles and cystometrograms has been investigated. These agents have marked effects on the results obtained; in particular, the urethral pressure profile was raised by opiates and lowered by anaesthetic induction agents. Bladder capacity as measured by the cystometrogram was greatly increased by halothane. These findings indicate that urodynamic studies should be performed only on conscious unsedated patients.", 
    "15": "Two hundred open heart cases anaesthetized with a combination of diazepam-ketamine using \"Micro-Mini\" drip administration technique were presented. The results were eminently desirable, and in the opinion of the authors are a notable improvement over other methods for all types of cardiovascular surgery including most advanced heart diseases. The advantages of this anaesthetic method for cardiovascular surgery are as follows: 1. Effects on cardiovascular system are minimal.--2. Respiratory depression is negligible.--3. There is no increase in salivation or muscle tone.--4. Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia are simple and smooth.--5. Anaesthesia can be maintained, using a high concentration of oxygen alone, by a slight increase in rate of ketamine administration whenever necessary.--6. Post-anaesthetic psychotomimetic effects are negligible.--7. Nearly 100% of patients have excellent amnesia.--8. It has a wide margin of safety.--9. This technique has proved highly acceptable to patients and surgeons. We feel ketamine should be used in small dosages continuously administered with either \"Micro-Mini\" drip infusion or infusion pump. Ketamine given in this fashion should be regarded as an analgesic.", 
    "16": "Recurrent hallucinations appeared in an 11-year-old boy during 5 days following ketamine anaesthesia. Previous anaesthesia with ketamine and adequate diazepam supplementation did not produce any such effect. The phenomenon of delayed recurring hallucinations is a rare but dangerous side-effect of ketamine, not unlike LSD flashbacks. The described case lends support to previous reports on the value of diazepam in the prevention of post-ketamine perceptual abnormalities.", 
    "17": "Eight normal subjects were tested on a battery of subjective and psychological tests 12 hours after a hypnotic dose of chlordesmethyldiazepam (1 or 2 mg), amylobarbitone sodium (100 mg), and a placebo. The tests included self-ratings of hypnotic effects and alertness; reactiontime, card-sorting, coding and cancellation tasks; arithmetic; and tapping. Before each task, test anxiety and performance expectation was self-rated; and after the task, judgment of performance was self-rated. Residual effects were definitely detectable after the 2-mg dose of benzodiazepine with both behavioral impairment and subjective hangover. Both the 1-mg dose and the barbiturate were almost devoid of such effects. Very few drug effects on test anxiety and performance judgment were discerned. Plasma concentrations of amylobarbitone were related to decreases in test anxiety and of chlordesmethyldiazepam with ratings of sleepiness.", 
    "18": "The capacity of the narcotic antagonists naloxone and nalorphine and the benzodiazepine derivatives diazepam and oxazepam to increase the LD50s of the narcotic analgesics morphine and methadone administered at convulsant doses was eveluated in the mouse. Naloxone produced a dose-related increase in the LD50s of both morphine and methadone. Iiazepam and oxazepam were also effective in increasing the LD50s of the narcotics; this effect was additive with that of naloxone. However, the maximal increase in the LD50s of the narcotics produced by pretreatment with naloxone alone was not increased further by the combined pretreatment of naloxone and a benzodiazepine. The anticonvulsant trimethadione did not elevate the LD50s of methadone, nor did it potentiate the effects of naloxone. These results suggest that the benzodiazepines may reduce the lethality of narcotic analgesics administered at high doses by a mechanism other than by an anticonvulsant effect alone. Therefore, the present results support the conclusion that the capacity to increase the convulsant LD50 of the narcotic analgesics is a general property of the narcotic antagonists.", 
    "19": "Forty-five out-patients with clinically manifested anxiety were tested in order to study the effects of 2 weeks' treatment with placebo, diazepam (5-10 mg three times daily) or thioridazine (25-50 mg three times daily) on their psychomotor skills related to driving. When compared with placebo, diazepam increased the number of mistakes in reaction and co-ordination tests and also decreased ability to discriminate the fusion of flickering light. When compared to other groups, reactive and co-ordinative skills were more impaired in patients treated with thioridazine which also impaired divided attention. Aubjectively thioridazine was not experienced as effective an anxiolytic as diazepam.", 
    "20": "In man, diazepam alone and in combination with scopolamine interferes with the memory of visual and painful stimuli. With a 15-minute interval between injection of the drug and the showing of emotionally neutral pictures, scopolamine (0.5 mg/70 kg) produces 14 per cent forgetting when evaluated 24 hours later. Under these conditions diazepam (10 mg/70 kg) produces 41 per cent forgetting, while the combination causes 64 per cent. Under conditions designed to insure selection of subjects in whom registration was clearly quite intact at the time of the initial exposure to the pictures, memory was still found to be impaired when tested 24 hours later. Graded doses of diazepam to as much as mg/70 kg in combination with 0.5 mg/70 kg scopolamine produced a virtually linear dose-response curve for amnesia. These results are compatible with the interpretation that the diazepam-scopolamine mixture interferes with memory by blocking consolidation of the memory trace.", 
    "21": "In a controlled, double-blind, cross-over study with diazepam (DZ) and placebo (PL) various clinical, psychological, and pharmacological parameters were studied in 33 patients having identical impacted third molars removed. The patients were admitted to the study consecutively and nonparametric statistics were used throughout the study for the evaluation (Wilcoxon's matched-pairs signed test). The following aspects were examined: Continous reaction times (CRT), rating scales (a.m. Beecher), blood pressure, pulse, plasma concentration of DZ and of N-desmethyldiazepam, visual changes, amnesia, adverse reactions, recalling of duration of surgery, orientation in time, phlebitis, and final evaluation performed by the patient. The operative conditions were found to be excellent, and only a few adverse effects were noticed. The patients expressed an overall enthusiasm about the sedation. In the rating scales only the predominantly sedative items were affected and not the anxiolytic ones. Neither the heart rate nor the systolic blood pressure were significantly changed; on the contrary, the DZ-group was less affected than the PL-group when maximum increases in the systolic blood pressure were compared in the two groups. The continuous reaction times were significantly correlated to the plasma concentrations of diazepam, especially 1 hour after sedation. The reported recurrence of initial clinical symptoms 6 hours after sedation due to the N-desmethyldiazepam could not be demonstrated in this study. The CRT has proved itself to be of great value in discriminating between different kinds of cerebral affections; the patients with DZ-intoxication showed significantly faster CRT 1 hour after injection than did patients suffering from well-documented cerebral disorders such as organic brain damage or hepatic encephalopathia.", 
    "22": "Four rhesus monkeys were reared for the first eight months of life in total social isolation. One animal died during this period; the three remaining subjects were treated with diazepam in an isolation chamber, in their home cages, and in a playroom testing situation. Diazepam significantly decreased the self-disturbance behaviors of two subjects, and there was even the appearance of some social behaviors, although they were limited and not of the same quality as in nonisolated subjects. The authors discuss the implications of the data for understanding the significance of the social isolation syndrome in monkeys as a model for human psychoses.", 
    "23": "Twenty male chronic schizophrenic patients participated in a double-blond between-patient study of the GABA-like drug baclofen to evaluate the antipsychotic effect of baclofen. No difference was found between the 10 patients who received baclofen and 10 who received placebo with regard to the number of days before a worsening of their psychiatric condition necessitated treatment with chlorpromazine, the total score for psychotic symptoms before and after treatment for 10 weeks, or the total consumption of chlorpromazine. Discontinuation of baclofen did not exacerbate the psychotic symptoms. Baclofen was superior to placebo in the treatment of anxiety, which is of particular interest in view of the recent theories on the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. The relationship between the gabergic system and the dopaminergic system with regard to the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum is discussed as well as the suggestion based on animal experiments that baclofen has an antipsychotic effect.", 
    "24": "The pharmacokinetics and plasma binding of diazepam were compared in man, dog, rabbit, guinea pig and rat. Diazepam (D) and its major metabolite, desmethyl-diazepam, were measured in blood and plasma by a specific and sensitive gas-liquid chromatography assay with an electron capture detector. After an intravenous bolus injection plasma levels of D declined biexponentially in all species examined and the data were analyzed according to the two-compartment open model. The binding of D and desmethyldiazepam has been determined at therapeutic concentrations by equilibrium dialysis in man (96.8 and 96.6%, respectively), dog (96.0 and 95.9%), rabbit (89.9 and 94.7%), guinea pig (91.3 and 78.6%) and rat (86.3 and 90.5%). In man, the elimination half-life, T1/2(beta), increased significantly (P less than .01) with decreasing total plasma clearance (Cl). Plasma binding affected Vd and Cl, but only Cl increased significantly (P less than .05), if more free D was available. This indicates that unbound drug is rate-determining for clearance by the liver, and that D fits into the restrictive elimination class in man. In the four animal species tested, Cl was a direct linear function of the body surface area. T1/2(beta) and the rates of drug clearance were characteristic figures for each species: from 1.1 hours and 81.6 ml/min/kg in the rat to 32.9 hours and 0.35 ml/min/kg in man, whereas T1/2(alpha), the half-life of distribution, varied only approximately 3-fold (0.3-1.0 hours) in the different species. A considerably higher extraction ratio than the unbound fraction of diazepam exists in these animal species, and blood clearance exceeds liver blood flow, giving reason to assume a much higher ability of the liver to metabolize D, and a species-dependent extrahepatic metabolism. The large variations described suggest that pharmacokinetic data or plasma binding results cannot simply be extrapolated to man.", 
    "25": "Following administration of chlordiazepoxide HCl to man, N-desmethyldiazepam, a known metabolite of diazepam (Valium), was identified in plasma. The metabolite was identified on the basis of its thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) mobility, electron-capture gas-chromatographic (EC-GC) retention time, and mass spectrum relative to authentic N-desmethyldiazepam. Plasma levels of N-desmethyldiazepam in subjects receiving both single and chronic doses of chlordiazepoxide were determined by an EC-GC method with a limit of sensitivity of 10 ng/ml using 2-ml samples and by a radioimmunoassay procedure which had a limit of sensitivity of 20 ng/ml using a 0.1-ml sample. Both assay methods gave good agreement for the levels of N-desmethyldiazepam. In subjects receiving a single 30-mg oral or intravenous dose of chlordiazepoxide, measurable levels of N-desmethyldiazepam in plasma (10 to 60 ng/ml) were obtained 24 to 72 hr after administration. In 5 subjects receiving 10 mg of chlordiazepoxide three times a day, steady-state levels of N-desmethyldiazepam in plasma were reached after about 1 wk of administration. The mean maximum and minimum steady-state levels of N-desmethyldiazepam were 260 and 220 ng/ml of plasma, respectively. Similar steady-state levels were observed on treatment with 30 mg of chlordiazepoxide over 24 hr.", 
    "26": "Oxymetazoline (an alpha-receptor agonist) reduced and phentolamine (an alpha-receptor antagonist) increased depolarization-induced release (potassium or electrical field stimulation) of 3H-noradrenaline (NA) from superfused neocortical slices in a dose-dependent way. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase also reduced NA release; this effect could be reversed by phentolamine. Phosphodiesterase inhibition potentiated the effect of oxymetazoline. It is suggested that stimulation of presynaptic alpha-receptors may reduce NA release up to about 60% and that increased cyclic AMP formation might be involved in this modulation.", 
    "27": "The effects of diazepam on evoked and spontaneous activity of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) principal (P) and inhibtory (I) cells were examined in rats. In the majority of P cells tested both spontaneous and evoked activity were suppressed following diazepam treatment with these effects being altered little by a pentylenetetrazol (Metrazol) challenge. In two P cells, which were offresponding to photic pulse stimulation, evoked and spontaneous activity was enhanced by diazepam but again these effects were altered little by the Metrazol challenge. I cell spontaneous activity was suppressed by diazepam and augmented by the Metrazol challenge; however, post-stimulus activity was relatively unaffected by either treatment. These results were discussed in terms of support for a functional re-evaluation of the rat dLGN.", 
    "28": "Ketamine was administered to 18 baboons (Papio papio) to disrupt epileptic discharges elicited through intracarotid air injection. Discharge suppression was obtained in all animals but could be preceded by a phase of enhancement of the epileptic patterns, which rendered necessary the injection of a supplementary dose. The mechanisms of Ketamine action are discussed, in connection with data from the literature. Some of the latter suggest that its use in proved epileptics facilitates paroxystic patterns or even convulsions while others emphasize its antiepileptic action. Present data corroborate the ambivalent action of this drug. However, its dominant depressant effect obtained with increasing doses is somewhat favourable to its administration to epileptic patients.", 
    "29": "The effects of pentobarbital and diazepam were compared in a series of tests in squirrel monkeys; the effects of phenobarbital and flurazepam were compared in a second series. Observations were made of gross behavior and on the ECoG; the latter was analyzed by the spectral density technique. The two barbiturates induced sedation,which was occasionally so deep that the monkeys could not be readily aroused. The benzodiazepines induced sedation in some monkeys, but others showed signs of restlessness. The ECoG showed general slowing with the barbiturates, whereas the benzodiazepines produced mixed fast and slow patterns. Spectral density analysis showed that pentobarbital increased activity at frequencies below 40 Hz, with the largest increases occurring below 8 Hz. Phenobarbital increased activity below 8 Hz, but differed from pentobarbital by decreasing activity above 13 Hz. The benzodiazepines increased activity below 8 Hz, decreased it between 8 and 20 Hz, and increased it between 20 and 50 Hz.", 
    "30": "Forty-six outpatients with anxiety tension states took part in a study on the effects of anxiolytic drugs. After the first interview the subjects also filled in a questionnaire as to their expectations of treatment outcome (n=41) and their experience of the first consultation (n=42), and the doctors made a prognostic evaluation (n=46). The relations between these three factors and background variables as well as initial ratings and outcome as rated by the doctors at follow-up examinations after 2, 4, and 8 weeks were investigated. Expectations, experience, and prognosis were not related to each other. Less hopeful patients more often considered conflicts to be the exclusive cause of their disorder and they were rated higher on signs and on the variable difficulties in being with people. Patients with less favourable experience more often considered practical and economic difficulties to be a cause of their disorder. Single or divorced patients were more often judged to have a less favourable prognosis. More positive expectations and a favourable prognosis. More positive expectations and a favourable prognosis were to some extent related to a better outcome after 2 and 4 weeks and a favourable experience was to some extent related to a better outcome after 4 and 8 weeks.", 
    "31": "Ventilatory response to CO2 was measured before and after two different benzodiazepine hypnotics in both chronic bronchitics and patients without chest disease. Flurazepam, but not nitrazepam, produced a significant decrease in CO2 sensitivity, although there was no significant change in FEV1 or mixed venous PCO2. This is the first unequivocal evidence of central depression of respiration by a benzodiazepine and may be the mechanism by which benzodiazepines cause deterioration in patients with respiratory failure.", 
    "32": "The metabolism of lorazepam by man and four other species is reviewed. Lorazepam and its metabolites in blood, urine and faeces were identified by thin-layer and gas chromatography and by mass spectrometry. The principal metabolite in man, dog, pig and cat is the glucuronide, but the rat produces other metabolites after small doses of lorazepam, and significant amounts of the glucuronide only after high doses. Since all metabolites, except the glucuronide, occur in small quantities only in man, most studies in man have been confined to an estimation of gree and conjugated lorazepam. Blood concentrations of unconjugated lorazepam peak at 1-4 h, significant concentrations persisting for 24 h and decreasing slowly over the next 24 h. About 95% of a dose of lorazepam was accounted for in urine and faeces over a period of 5 days; 74.5% was excreted in the urine as lorazepam glucuronide and 13.5% as minor metabolites. The excretory half-life was 12 h. The blood concentrations and excretion rates are compatible with the clinical effects of lorazepam.", 
    "33": "We used the method described here to detect and identify seven benzodiazepine derivatives--diazepam, chlorodiazepoxide, nitrazepam, cloxazolam, oxazolam, oxazepam, and medazepam--and their metabolites in the urine of rabbits given the seven drugs orally. We column-chromatographed 25-ml samples of urine on Amberlite XAD-2. The drugs and their metabolites in the urine were adsorbed by the resin, irrespective of urinary pH, and upon successive elution with methanol and ethyl acetate/methanol/acetic acid (90/10/0.1 by vol) they could be separated and extracted from the normal components of urine with satisfactory analytical recovery. The conjugated metabolites were then enzymatically hydrolyzed and the hydrolysate was extracted into ethyl acetate and the extract thin-layer chromatographed to detect and identify each drug and each of its metabolites. In an experiment in which the urine of human subjects given 5 mg of nitrazepam orally was analyzed by this method, the metabolites of nitrazepam in the 24-h urine could be identified satisfactorily.", 
    "34": "The outcome of a standard four-day intensive symptomatic treatment programme with 39 agoraphobics is examined in relation to the incidence of fresh symptom emergence. Twenty-six patients suffered fresh symptom emergence during follow-up, and there was a significant association of fresh symptom emergence with poorer outcome at one-year follow-up. About 18 percent of patients were adversely affected by the treatment programme, as judged on a wide range of symptoms and measures of inter- and intra-personal adjustment. Sixteen individually treated patients are then compared with the 39 group-treated patients and differences in drop-out rate are discussed.", 
    "35": "Psychomotor skills and visual functions related to driving were measured double-blind cross-over in ten healthy volunteers before, and 1,3,5 and 7 h after a single oral administration of diazepam (10mg), medazepam (15 mg) or lorazepam (2.5 mg). The late effects of lorazepam were tested in seven other subjects 12 and 24 h after the administration. Lorazepam impaired almost all the measured skills more (P less than 0.05 to 0.001) than diazepam, medizepam or the placebo. The lorazepam impairment of reactive skills and flicker fusion discrimination remained statistically significant (P less than 0.05) for as long as 12 h. Medazepam impaired only reactive skills and flicker fusion, the latter remaining impaired (P less than 0.05) for as long a 5 h after the administration. The magnitude and duration of the effects of diazepam were intermediate between those of lorazepam and medazepam. Diazepam impaired perceptual speed and reactive and co-ordinative skills as well as flicker fusion discrimination and visual parameters related to driving. Slight impairments in performance were measurable for up to 5 h after administration but at 7 h the results resembled those measured after the placebo. The lack of alterations in adaptation to darkness, sensitivity to brightness or visual discrimination ability in bright counterlight at a time when flicker fusion discrimination was severely depressed suggests that an impaired ability to discriminate flickering light is of no or little clinical significance to driving ability. It is concluded that patients receiving a 2.5 mg dose of lorazepam should not drive or operate machinery for 24 h after the administration. After diazepam (10 mg) or medazepam (15 mg) patients should refrain from driving or participating inskilled performances for only 5 to 7 hours.", 
    "36": "Action of enpiprazole on emotional behavior elicited by hypothalamic stimulation in rats and cats was investigated and comparisons were made with effects of diazepam. Two behavioral patterns were elicited by stimulation of the postero-medial part of the hypothalamus in rats: a food-carrying response beginning with exploratory movement and an analogue of fear. Enpiprazole frequently changed the food-carrying response into food-taking response and occasionally analogues of fear into food-carrying and /or food-taking responses. Thresholds for these behaviors were also elevated. Diazepam showed the same effects on the thresholds as enpiprazole, having but little effect on the behavioral patterns. In cats, enpiprazole evelvated the thresholds for affective-defensive responses induced by hypothalamic stimulation in 6 of 8 cases, but lowered them in 2 cases. This suggests that enpiprazple has a 'biphasic effect' in the central nervous system. By contrast,diazepam consistently elevated thresholds. Comparing the action of enpiprazole with that of diazepam it can be presumed that the former is a different type of anxiolytic drug than the latter.", 
    "37": "Clonazepam, one of the benzodiazepines, induced head twitches in mice in a dose-dependent manner and sustained them for at least 120 min. Some of the benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, fludiazepam, and nimetazepam also significantly induced head twitches at doses higher than 10 mg/kg, but other benzodiazepines like diazepam, flurazepam, oxazepam, medazepam, and chlordiazepoxide did not significantly induce head twitches at doses up to 60 mg/kg. The head twitches induced by clonazepam were more strongly blocked by a n antiserotonin drug, cyproheptadine than catecholamine receptor blocking drugs, haloperidol, propranolol, and phentolamine, and were not blocked by GABA receptor blocking drugs, bicuculline and picrotoxin, as well as by a glycine receptor blocking drug, strychnine. Clonazepam also increased the head twitches induced by mescaline, a serotonin receptor stimulant. These results indicate that the head twitches induced by clonazepam might be mediated via serotonergic neuron systems.", 
    "38": "Muscimol (8.8 mumol/kg i.v.) and diazepam (7.04 mumol/kg i.p.) decreased the rate of turnover of acetylcholine in midbrain and cortex of rat brain but failed to change acetylcholine turnover in striatum and hippocampus. The similarity in the profile of the action of diazepam and muscimol on acetylcholine turnover in various brain structures adds support to the view that GABA participates in mediating the actions of diazepam. Since the striatum contains an abundance of GABA neurones and intrinsic cholinergic neurones, it is inferred that the metabolism of acetylcholine, and presumably the activity of striatal cholinergic neurones are not regulated by the activation of GABA receptors. Similar considerations apply to the cholinergic pathway projecting from the septum to the hippocampus.", 
    "39": "In the present study, effects of psychotropic drugs were analyzed by observing avoidance and escape behavior or rabbits under hypothalamic electrical stimulation. In avoidance behavior, chlorpromazine (CPZ) and diazepam (DZP) depressed avoidance response and extended avoidance response latency and head movement latency. Autonomic behavior such as opening of palpebral fissure and pupil size were also delayed. The locus of movement and count of head movement were depressed by the administration of each drug. On the other hand, unlike CPZ, DZP extended escape response latency. On escape behavior, effects of CPZ and DZP were apparently different. Unlike CPZ, DZP induced avoidance behavior and increased locus of movement. With methamphetamine, no avoidance behavior was observed, but under conditional stimulation, the behavior and the escape response latency were decreased. Chlordiazepoxide induced avoidance behavior.", 
    "40": "Despite the similarity of the nitrazepam and phenobarbital spectra it was found that with their single usage the nature of tolerance for these substances differs quite substantially. With long-term introduction of nitrazepam to mice and rats in invariable and increasing doses there is seen a development of tolerance in the sense of the muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive action and in lethality without any marked attenuation of the tranquillizing effect. In contradistinction to this a long-term administration of phenobarbital is followed by a diminution of its tranquillizing action and by a slowly proceeding reduction of muscle relaxing manifestations. Crosswise tolerance among nitrazepam, diazepam and phenobarbital is marked but feebly. It is presumed that one of the possible mechanisms responsible for the nitrazepam tolerance in mice and rats may be a change in metabolic transformations and redistribution of metabolites.", 
    "41": "The influence of a number of neuroleptics and antidepressants on the release of 3H-GABA from the synaptosomas of the cerebral cortex in rats was studied. Chlorpromazine, phthorphenazine, trifluperidol, imipramine, phthoracizine caused an intensified liberation of 3H-GABA from the synaptosomas. In this phenothiazine neuroleptics proved more active than did trifluperidol and antidepressants. New neuroleptics--azabuperon and carbidine and also diphenylhydantoin tended to restrict the liberation of the mediator from synaptosomas. The tranquilizer diazepam, gamma-oxybutyric acid and carbamazepine failed to have any significnat effect on this process. The described effects of thepsychotropic substances are due, apparently, to their direct influence on the synaptomal membrane.", 
    "42": "The report is concerned with the action of single doses of aminazine, seduxen and benzctyzine on the EMG of the orbicular muscle of the mouth, pulse frequency, GSR and EEG during rest and in the process of speech in individuals with stuttering and neurotic disturbances (25 cases) and in early organic lesions (20 cases). The conclusion is made that there is a selective effect of these preparations on the different structures of the functional brain systems in stutterers.", 
    "43": "The synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline derivatives from 1-arylpyrroles bearing an acetic acid or acetonitrile moiety on the benzene or pyrrole nucleus is described. Pyrrolo [1,2-a]quinoline derivatives have some pharmaceutical interest as cyclic analogues of 9H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]indole and 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4]-benzodiazepine, the basic structures of the antitumor antibiotics mitomycin C, anthramycin and tomaymycin.", 
    "44": "A report is made of five tetanus patients who were treated with large repetitive doses of Diazepam and became comatose. The period of impaired consciousness varied from thirteen to twenty-one days. None had significant respiratory depression, and full recovery occurred in all. It is proposed that Diazepam-induced prolonged coma should be regarded as a side-effect rather than a toxic effect and should caution rather than contra-indicate further use of large doses of the drug in the management of tetanus.", 
    "45": "Key pecking of two pigeons was maintained under a multiple schedule of food presentation. In the presence of one keylight stimulus responding produced food according to a fixed-interval 5-min schedule. Additionally, during this component, each 50th response produced electric shock. When a different keylight stimulus was present, key pecking resulted in food delivery under a variable-interval 3-min schedule. Responding was suppressed by shock presentation (punishment) but was still positively accelerated throughout each fixed-interval cycle; steady response rates occurred during the alternate component when only the variable-interval schedule was in effect. Overall rates of punished responding were largely unchanged with d-amphetamine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg); unpunished responding was generally either increased slightly or was decreased. Pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide (1.0-17.0 mg/kg) administered alone increased both punished and unpunished responding at most doses. Combinations of d-amphetamine with either pentobarbital or chlordiazepoxide produced increases in punished responding that exceeded those obtained with either of these drugs alone. The combined effects of d-amphetamine and either pentobarbital or chlordiazepoxide on unpunished responding depended on the individual dose combinations. Combinations of d-amphetamine with pentobarbital or chlordiazepoxide produced effects on both punished and unpunished responding that differed substantially from those obtained when any of these drugs were administered separately.", 
    "46": "Morphine (0.2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) were injected IV after delivery of the fetus in 68 parturients undergoing cesarean section (CS). General anesthesia was with thiamylal-N2O-O2 (4:2) and muscle relaxant. Twenty-four to 36 hours postoperatively, 1 patient had recall, 1 had unpleasant dreams, and 2 had pleasant dreams. The incidence of recall and unpleasant dreams was 3.8 percent in elective CS and 0 percent in emergency cesareans. Morphine-diazepam combination caused anterograde and retrograde amnesia. During the cesarean, movement of patient, size of pupils, or changes in blood pressure were not indicative of awareness or dreams. During anesthesia, 33 percent O2 produced adequate oxygenation of mother and fetus.", 
    "47": "A progressive fibrous myopathy may result from chronic intramuscular drug abuse. This complication may mimic other rheumatic disorders and early recognition may prevent disability. The patient described here presented with fixed flexion and extension contracture of hips and knees, respectively, after abusing meperidine and other agents for 3 years. Soft tissues of thighs and buttocks were \"wood hard,\" EMG showed absence of action potentials in affected muscles, and biopsy revealed extensive replacement of muscle with dense, acellular fibrous tissue. Possible mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "48": "The effects of diazepam on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygen uptake (CMRO2) was studied using a 133xenon modification of the Kety-Schmidt (1948) technique in paralyzed, artifically ventilated rats with and without simultaneous administration of 70 per cent nitrous oxide. Diazepam was given iv in doses that induced light to heavy sedation or general anesthesia. When given with 70 per cent nitrous oxide, diazepam in sedative and anesthetic doses lowered CBF and CMRO2 to about 60 per cent of control. In the absence of nitrous oxide all doses of diazepam caused moderate (20-30 per cent) decreases in CBF, but CMRO2 remained unchanged or was only slightly lowered. It is concluded that diazepam interacts with nitrous oxide to produce a reduction in CMRO2 similar to that seen in barbiturate anesthesia, but that alone the drug produces sedation and anesthesia without a comparable decrease in CMRO2.", 
    "49": "Multiple malformations in all four children of a mother taking anticonvulsant drugs are reported, along with the extended family pedigree.", 
    "50": "As the anticonvulsant plasma level of diazepam (DZP) after intravenous injection is maintained only for a short period, it is profitable to administer DZP as an intravenous infusion. It has, however, been claimed that DZP cannot be mixed with dextrose injection as DZP would precipitate. As this is in contrast to our clinical experience we added DZP of various brands to dextrose injections. A precipitate was in fact found in dextrose injections containing Valium and Stesolid whereas Diazepam A.L. was not only slightly cloudy. The concentration of DZP was, however, the same in all the samples and corresponded to the calculated concentration. The precipitate in the solutions with Valium and Stesolid which did not pass the filter must therefore be due to additives, most probably benzoates. On the basis of these findings and our clinical experience of this mode of administration we recommend the infusion method as one of the most effective in the acute treatment of status epilepticus.", 
    "51": "Sixty-eight patients with various types of epileptic seizures have been treated with clonazepam (Rivotril). Fifty-four patients could be evaluated. In 44 patients, clonazepam was used as a supplement to insufficient previous medication. Ten patients received clonazepam alone. The mean duration of treatment was 2 years and 7 months. Thirty-three patients are still on clonazepam, with a mean duration of treatment of 3 years and 4 months. In 34 patients (63%) a reduction of more than 50% was seen in the seizure frequency of the only type suffered by a patient, or of one of several types. No significant decrease in antiepileptic potency with time was observed. Medication was withdrawn in a total of 21 of the 54 patients because of freedom from seizures (2 patients), lack of effect (7 patients), increased frequency of seizures (3 patients), or lack of cooperation and/or side-effects (3 patients). In 5 patients, the drug may have provoked new types of epileptic seizure. This long-term follow-up study seems to substantiate the favorable antiepileptic properties of clonazepam.", 
    "52": "The data generated from the application of spectral analytical techniques to the analysis of electroencephalograms (EEG) provide a reliable base for the quantification of such data. Drugs with a wide range of central nervous system (CNS) activities were characterized by their effects on neocortical EEGs of Macaca mulatta monkeys according to the specificity of autospectral changes at different anatomical sites. Changes in total spectral power, in the shape of the spectral envelope, and in the relative stability of the drug-induced EEG were assessed at various doses. Electroencephalograms were recorded from epidural electrodes under resting conditions and under the influence of CNS drugs. Autospectra representing sequential 4-second samples of EEG were generated successively over a nominal frequency band of 0-64 Hz. Averages of sequential autospectra were computed over specified time periods. Spectral power over the entire bandwidth and selected frequency regions was calculated and compared. This facilitated the grouping of drugs with similar activities, as well as the distinguishing of changes not readily detectable by visual inspection of the conventional EEG in the time domain.", 
    "53": "The effect of diazepam, depakin, thiosemicarbazide (TSC) and bicucullin on the spontaneous and incuced (by stimulation of the sciatic nerve) activity of the cells of the sensory-motor cortex was studied on the unanesthetized immobilized (curarized) albino rats. Diazepam proved to intensify the inhibitory phenomena, i.e. decreased the frequency of spontaneous discharges and prolonged the postactivation depression of the neuron impulsation (the inhibitory pause. Depakin increasing the GABA content in the brain acted similarly. The GABA-ergic receptors blocker, bicucullin and TSC, decreasing its content, on the contrary, weakened the inhibitory phenomena. There was also revealed a reversible antagonism between diazepam and bicucullin in their effect on the neuronal activity. The data obtained confirmed the supposition put forward formerly on the capacity of diazepam to intensify the effect of GABA on the neurons of the cerebral cortex."
