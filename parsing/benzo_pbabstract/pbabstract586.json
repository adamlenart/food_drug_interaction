    "0": "This case history of abnormal sensitivity to ordinary doses of drug with minimal respiratory depressant activities in Leber's disease underlines the fact that patients with this abnormality are exceedingly sensitive to ordinary doses of anaesthetic and sedative drugs.", 
    "1": "The authors describe a patient with major affective disorder, unipolar depressed type, recurrent, psychosis who went into a catatonic stupor state while being treated with maprotiline hydrochloride and thiothixene. The article also deals with findings on electroencephalogram, response to treatment, a review of other similar case reports, and the clinical significance and relevance based upon which other clinicians can take some precautionary measures while prescribing this newer antidepressant, especially in combination with a neuroleptic.", 
    "2": "Ten patients who were prescribed daily doses of diazepam for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, or psychosomatic symptoms were assessed repeatedly on measures of short-term and long-term memory on and off the drug. Both kinds of memory, especially the latter, appeared detrimentally affected by the drug. However, dosage seemed to be inversely related to the degree of memory impairment. In general, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that diazepam interferes with the memory consolidation process. The negative relationship between drug dosage and degree of memory impairment might be due to habituation toward this particular side effect by heavier drug users. It is suggested that on theoretical grounds, the use of diazepam in conjunction with the behavioral psychotherapies may be contraindicated.", 
    "3": "Intermittent oral or rectal administration of diazepam for the prophylactic treatment of febrile convulsions has given results comparable to the continuous use of phenobarbital while limiting side effects and risks of toxicity. Since we believe that nitrazepam is a better anticonvulsant than diazepam, we performed a study to evaluate the effectiveness of this medication in the prophylactic treatment of febrile convulsions. Nitrazepam was given only when the children had fever and almost exclusively in children with a high risk of recurrence (less than 12 months of age at first convulsion; atypical convulsion; one or several previous convulsions). Thirty one children with a high risk of recurrence received nitrazepam. The rate of recurrence in this group was 19.3% after a follow-up of 16 months, compared to 45.8% in 24 children who also had a high risk of recurrence but in whom the parents refused the medication or gave it inadequately (p less than 0.05). Fifty one children with a low risk of recurrence also were evaluated and followed for at least 12 months (mean 15.4 months). Six were treated with nitrazepam, mostly because of parental anxiety, and none had a recurrence; of the 45 untreated children in this group, 6 (13.6%) had another convulsion. These results show the efficiency of nitrazepam in the prophylactic treatment of febrile convulsions.", 
    "4": "Intracerebroventricular injection of 1-kynurenine sulfate (10 micrograms) eliminated anticaffeine effect of diazepam (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) in mice. Antipentylenetetrazole (0.5-2.5 mg/kg) and anticonflict (1-2.5 mg/kg) effects of diazepam were not altered by kynurenine (0.1-10 micrograms). The sedative effect of diazepam (1 and 4 mg/kg) was potentiated by kynurenine (1 microgram). Stimulation of locomotion induced by kynurenine (0.5 and 2.5 micrograms) was prevented or perversed by pretreatment with diazepam (1 mg/kg). In a conflict situation test, diazepam and kynurenine had an opposite action, respectively increasing and decreasing the number of transitions between light and dark compartments. The central effects of kynurenine can be related and not related to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "5": "The teratogenic potential of a combination of chlordiazepoxide (Cdz) and amitriptyline (Amt) was examined with regard to both internal and external anomalies. Timed pregnant golden hamsters were given a single intraperitoneal injection on day 8 of gestation of one of the following: chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (28.5 mg/kg), amitriptyline hydrochloride (70.3 mg/kg), Cdz-Amt combination (28.5 mg/kg Cdz + 70.3 mg/kg Amt, in order to retain the 1:2.5 dose ratio utilized in a clinically-used preparation of these agents), or saline vehicle (control). Fetuses were recovered on gestation day 15 following maternal sacrifice. Cranial malformations were analyzed in Bouin's-fixed fetuses by making 1-mm coronal sections through each head, whereas visceral anomalies were examined following general dissection of each body. Amt alone produced a significant (P less than 0.05) incidence of bent tail and encephalocele, whereas Cdz significantly (P less than 0.05) altered the male:female ratio of surviving fetuses when compared with saline-injected controls. The Cdz-Amt combination caused significant increases in cranial malformations, open eye, bent tail, abnormal lung, and urogenital anomalies. The teratogenic effects of potentiation between the components of this combination are discussed in terms of external and internal malformations.", 
    "6": "Toluene can have striking acute behavioral effects and is subject to abuse by inhalation. To determine if its actions resemble those of drugs used in the treatment of anxiety (\"anxiolytics\"), two sets of experiments were undertaken. Inasmuch as prevention of pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions is an identifying property of this class of agents, we first demonstrated that pretreatment with injections of toluene delayed the onset of convulsive signs and prevented the tonic extension phase of the convulsant activity in a dose-related manner. Injections of another alkyl benzene, m-xylene, were of comparable potency to toluene. Inhalation of toluene delayed the time to death after pentylenetetrazol injection in a manner related to the duration and concentration of exposure; at lower convulsant doses, inhalation of moderate concentrations (EC50, 1311 ppm) prevented death. Treatment with a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (Ro 15-1788) failed to reduce the anticonvulsant activity of inhaled toluene. Anxiolytics also attenuate the reduction in response rate produced by punishment with electric shock. Toluene increased rates of responding suppressed by punishment when responding was maintained under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-interval punishment schedule of reinforcement. Distinct antipunishment effects were observed after 2 hr of exposure to 1780 and 3000 ppm of toluene; the rate-increasing effects of toluene were related to concentration and to time after the termination of exposure. Thus, toluene and m-xylene resemble in several respects clinically useful drugs such as the benzodiazepines.", 
    "7": "The effects of diazepam alone, and in combination with acute and chronic exposure to methadone, on arterial pH, pCO2 and pO2 in the rat were evaluated. Measurements were made before drug administration and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min postadministration. Diazepam (20 mg/kg s.c.) did not cause any significant changes in arterial pCO2 or pH. However, it did cause a significant increase in arterial pO2 tension (P less than or equal to .05). The magnitude of this effect was essentially the same after acute and chronic diazepam treatment. The increase in arterial pO2 tension was attributed to a decrease in tissue uptake of oxygen associated with the decrease in body temperature that occurred after diazepam treatment. Acute and, to a far lesser extent, chronic administration of methadone (5 mg/kg/day i.p.) caused significant decreases in arterial pH and pO2 and increases in pCO2 (P less than or equal to .05). When given in combination with methadone, diazepam potentiated markedly the respiratory depressant effects of methadone. The most severe respiratory depression occurred when both drugs were used together acutely. The effects of the acute diazepam-chronic methadone treatment were 100 to 200% greater than those that occurred with the chronic diazepam-chronic methadone treatment, indicating the development of a tolerance to the potentiating ability of diazepam. These results show that there is a real potential for severe respiratory depression when these drugs, methadone and diazepam, are used concurrently, especially for the first time.", 
    "8": "The effects of phenobarbital, clonazepam, valproic acid, ethosuximide and phenytoin were examined in pigeons performing under a repeated acquisition procedure. Clonazepam (0.06-0.75 mg/kg), valproic acid (40-120 mg/kg), ethosuximide (40-160 mg/kg) and phenytoin (2.5-15 mg/kg) produced generally dose-dependent decreases in rate of responding, whereas phenobarbital (5-50 mg/kg) had little consistent effect on response rate across the dose range studied. Phenobarbital and clonazepam produced dose-dependent increases in error rates. Although valproic acid and phenytoin generally increased errors relative to control values, this effect was not directly dose-dependent or consistent across subjects. A within-session analysis of the distribution of drug-induced increases in errors revealed that the main effect of phenobarbital, clonazepam, valproic acid and phenytoin was to increase errors during early acquisition (i.e., before the procurement of 15 or fewer reinforcers). Later in the session, a similar number of errors per reinforcer was made during drug and control sessions. In contrast to the other anticonvulsants examined, ethosuximide had little effect on error rates. These results suggest that there are qualitative as well as quantitative differences in the effects of anticonvulsant drugs under the repeated acquisition procedure.", 
    "9": "A double-blind randomised study was performed to investigate whether aminophylline reversed the sedative effect of diazepam. Thirty-two patients undergoing genito-urinary surgery with spinal or topical anaesthesia were given diazepam to maintain a state of deep sedation. Postoperatively patients received either aminophylline (60-120 mg) or physiological saline intravenously. The aminophylline group showed a rapid reversal of sedation, which persisted throughout the observation period of 2 hours. No such effect was seen in the patients who received saline and the difference was still obvious after 2 hours. It is concluded that aminophylline is a potent antagonist to the sedative effect of diazepam.", 
    "10": "Lorazepam was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in eight patients with frequent partial complex seizures refractory to therapy with a combination of standard anticonvulsant drugs. Concomitant antiepileptic drugs were maintained at therapeutic serum levels throughout the study, and concentrations of lorazepam were monitored. Following an 8-week baseline observation, patients were randomly assigned to placebo or lorazepam (1 mg BID). The dose was increased biweekly until seizures stopped or unacceptable side effects occurred. Eight weeks later, patients were crossed over, and the same escalating dose paradigm was followed. When seizure frequency during the last 2 weeks of each treatment was compared, seven of eight patients had fewer seizures on lorazepam, and the eighth had decreased seizure duration (a significant difference: p less than 0.01, two-tailed sign test). Blood level data suggest a narrow therapeutic window, with seizure improvement occurring at concentrations of 20-30 ng/ml and side effects at greater than 33 ng/ml. Lorazepam appears to be a useful adjunct in refractory partial complex seizure therapy. It should not be stopped abruptly, as an increase in seizure frequency may result.", 
    "11": "The effects of intravenous lorazepam (0.05 mg/kg) on haemodynamics and oxygen transportation were studied in a group of 11 patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafting operation with high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia and compared to the changes in another group of 11 patients receiving the same anaesthesia, but saline instead of lorazepam. The measurements were made under stable haemodynamic conditions before the injection of lorazepam or saline, and repeated 5, 20 and 40 min after the injection. Lorazepam caused a slight decrease in the systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures and in the left ventricular stroke work index, as compared to the control group. The ECG or the rate-pressure product did not show changes indicative of myocardial oxygen supply/demand imbalance in either group. There was a similar decrease in the systemic oxygen transportation and an increase in the arterio-venous oxygen content difference in both groups, but the unchanged systemic oxygen consumption and arterial lactate level suggest a well-maintained tissue oxygenation. It is concluded that intravenous lorazepam does not cause important haemodynamic untoward effects as an adjunct to high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "12": "beta-Carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) binds with high affinity to brain benzodiazepine receptors and has potent behavioral and physiologic effects in primates. Dose-related increases in behavioral agitation, plasma cortisol level, BP, and heart rate were observed after administration of doses between 50 and 500 micrograms/kg of beta-CCE to rhesus monkeys. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with diazepam. Pretreatment with clonidine hydrochloride and propranolol hydrochloride, both of which have been reported to have anxiolytic actions in man, attenuated only selective aspects of the response to beta-CCE. The behavioral, endocrine, and physiologic effects of low doses of beta-CCE in monkeys are similar to those observed in anxious patients or normal subjects under anxiety-provoking or stressful situations. Administration of benzodiazepine receptor active antagonists such as beta-CCE to primates may, therefore, provide a valid and reproducible model of human anxiety that could be used to investigate specific biologic aspects of anxiety disorders.", 
    "13": "The relationship between the dose and anxiolytic effects of diazepam and the serum concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam were examined in groups of acutely and chronically anxious patients. The results showed a significant correlation between dose and serum nordiazepam concentrations after short-term (14-day) administration, but no significant association between clinical symptoms of anxiety and serum diazepam and nordiazepam. We conclude that the main value of serum benzodiazepine measurements in anxious patients in assessing compliance, particularly in patients suspected of taking more than the recommended dose. Serum nordiazepam is a more consistent index of dosage after chronic therapy than serum diazepam because it has a longer elimination half-time.", 
    "14": "Lower esophageal sphincter pressures were monitored with water-filled catheters in anesthetized opossums. Muscarinic agonists McN-A-343 and bethanechol were administered in the arterial supply of the sphincter. McN-A-343 caused relaxation after a brief contraction of the sphincter. Bethanechol caused a dose-dependent contraction. Tetrodotoxin antagonized the inhibitory effect of McN-A-343 but did not antagonized sphincter contraction caused by McN-A-343 or bethanechol. The mean ED50 values were 6.9 nmol/kg i.a. for McN-A-343-induced relaxation, 10.5 nmol/kg i.a. for McN-A-343-induced contraction and 0.4 nmol/kg i.a. for bethanechol-induced contraction. Atropine caused a dose-dependent rightward shift in the dose-response curves of inhibitory and excitatory effects of the two muscarinic agonists. Pirenzepine caused a dose-dependent rightward shift in the dose-response curves of McN-A-343-induced relaxation. Pirenzepine did not modify sphincter contraction caused by the muscarinic agonists. 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide, on the other hand, did not modify McN-A-343-induced sphincter relaxation but caused dose-dependent rightward shifts in the dose-response curves of sphincter contraction caused by McN-A-343 or bethanechol. These studies suggest that there are two distinct types of muscarine receptors in the opossum lower esophageal sphincter. The M1 muscarine receptors are present on the inhibitory neurons and participate in the synaptic transmission between vagal preganglionic and intramural postganglionic inhibitory neurons. They are activated by McN-A-343 and antagonized by pirenzepine. The M2 muscarine receptors are located directly on the sphincter muscle. They are also activated by McN-A-343, but are selectively activated by bethanechol and are antagonized by 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide.", 
    "15": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in the development of hypertension and in the regulation of blood pressure. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) offers an opportunity to explore the role of central GABA and other neurotransmitters in the genesis of high blood pressure. The receptor binding of [3H]GABA, [3H]flunitrazepam, and [3H]glutamate to synaptic membranes from the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of SHR rats were measured in animals of various ages. No significant differences between the SHR and a normotensive control strain of rats were found for any of the assays. The results indicate that in this model of hypertension, neither GABA nor glutamate function are involved, at least not in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum.", 
    "16": "An elevated X-maze with alternating open and enclosed arms was investigated as a model for the study of fear-induced behaviour. As predicted, the anxiolytics diazepam and amylobarbitone increased, and the putative anxiogenics ACTH and picrotoxin decreased the proportion of open arm entries. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine and ST587, and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists idazoxan, piperoxane, RS-21361 and yohimbine decreased relative open-arm entries, thus resembling the putative anxiogenics. On the other hand, azepexole, clonidine and guanabenz, agonists at alpha 2-adrenoceptors, and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and thymoxamine, enhanced the proportion of open arm entries at low doses, suggesting anxiolytic-like properties. A paradoxical fall in open arm entries occurred with these agents at higher doses. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of noradrenergic systems in 'fear'-motivated behaviour.", 
    "17": "General pharmacological activities of 450191-S were studied in various species of animals and compared with those of reference benzodiazepines (BDZ). 450191-S at doses of 10 mg/kg slightly decreased (-5 degrees C) the rectal temperature of rabbits. 450191-S decreased respiratory and heart rates in anesthetized cats, but the effects were less than those of diazepam or triazolam. 450191-S increased respiratory and heart rates in conscious dogs, but had no effect on the blood pressure, electrocardiogram and autonomic nervous system in cats and dogs. The drug displayed a slight spasmolytic activity in the small intestine of guinea pigs and a slight inhibitory effect on isolated non-pregnant and pregnant uteri of rats. These effects were less than those of diazepam or nitrazepam. Below doses of 25 mg/kg, 450191-S did not affect urinary volume and electrolyte excretions in rats. It also decreased brain norepinephrine (NE) turnover rates in rats, but decreased NE and dopamine turnover rates in mice. These effects of 450191-S were less than those of nitrazepam. 450191-S was found to be minimally irritating to the ocular mucosa in rabbits and did not irritate the stomach and small intestine in rats. These effects were also compared with those of active metabolites of 450191-S, M-1, M-2, M-A, M-3 and M-4, and the superiority of the mother compound over its metabolites was clarified.", 
    "18": "Interactions between 450191-S and other representative drugs which might be clinically used with 450191-S were behaviorally investigated in mice, and compared with the cases of nitrazepam, estazolam and triazolam. The potencies of 450191-S and nitrazepam in preventing pentetrazol convulsions were markedly decreased by aminopyrine, whereas that of estazolam was remarkably increased by phenytoin. Administration of nitrazepam with other drugs, except aminopyrine, or of estazolam together with haloperidol exhibited an anticonvulsive pattern different from the case of dosing with either drug alone. Only the effect of triazolam was not influenced by any drugs used. The potency of haloperidol against apomorphine-induced climbing behavior was significantly reduced by nitrazepam, and the pattern of the haloperidol effect was changed by treatment together with 450191-S or estazolam. However, triazolam had no influence on the effect of haloperidol. The antagonistic activity of imipramine to reserpine-induced hypothermia was slightly decreased by 450191-S, estazolam and triazolam, but little affected by nitrazepam. In the protection from maximal electroshock convulsions (MEC), the potency of phenytoin was significantly decreased by 450191-S and triazolam. Moreover, the anti-MES pattern of phenytoin was altered by nitrazepam. Estazolam exerted no significant influence on the effect of phenytoin. Analgesic activities of morphine and/or aminopyrine were potentiated by pretreatment with sleep-inducers, but not 450191-S. Thus, judging from the potency and stability of the anti-pentetrazol effect, 450191-S seems to be inferior to triazolam, but superior to nitrazepam and estazolam. Also, 450191-S may be differentiated from other sleep-inducers by the fact that only 450191-S did not potentiate the analgesic activities of morphine and aminopyrine.", 
    "19": "Pharmacological studies of premazepam in animals predicted antianxiety activity without sedation and, in combination with diazepam, a reduction in the sedative effects of the latter. The effects of single doses of premazepam (25 and 50 mg), diazepam (10 mg), premazepam (25 mg) plus diazepam (10 mg), and a placebo on subjective feelings, psychological tests and the EEG were studied in a double-blind cross-over study in 10 healthy subjects. In a repeated dose study in eight subjects, the effects on subjective feelings, psychological tests and the EEG of premazepam (5 and 10 mg twice-daily), diazepam (5mg twice-daily) and a placebo were compared. Premazepam had a different EEG profile from diazepam, producing more slow and less fast wave activity. In the single dose study its effects were similar to diazepam for sedative action and most of the psychological tests, with a tendency towards greater psychomotor impairment. In the repeated dose study, however, premazepam caused less sedation and also tended to produce less psychomotor impairment. The combination dose of premazepam (25 mg) plus diazepam (10 mg) in the single dose study indicated an additive effect rather than an antagonistic one.", 
    "20": "The benzodiazepine-receptors are close by the GABA-receptors. They are found in all areas of the brain, especially in the area of the cortex. The imidazo-benzodiazepine Ro 15-1788 has a high affinity to the receptor without showing any biological activity. The antagonist Ro 15-1788 cancels the sleeping effect, which was produced by benzodiazepines, within 30-60 s. Deep phases of sleep after 4 mg per 70 kg body weight lormetazepam, a dose which was not in clinical use up to now as well as the sleeping effect of 2 mg flunitrazepam per 70 kg body weight and 10-11 mg midazolam per 70 kg body weight are safely antagonized without adverse reactions. According to pharmacodynamic researches by means of EEG and psychometry the half-life period of the antagonist is shorter (1-2 h) than that of the agonist. The clinical application of the antagonist Ro 15-1788 (in patients) is at hand. The control of benzodiazepine-N2O/O2-anaesthesia seems to be guaranteed with the introduction of the antagonist for clinical use.", 
    "21": "Tifluadom produced a dose-related (0.08-5 mg kg-1) diuresis in normally hydrated rats. This diuretic effect was antagonized by kappa-antagonist doses of naloxone and blocked by morphine administration. This is further in-vivo evidence that tifluadom is a fairly specific kappa-opioid agonist.", 
    "22": "Adinazolam and its metabolites inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding in-vitro. The binding affinities of these compounds is significantly enhanced in the presence of 10-5 M muscimol, indicating that both adinazolam and its metabolites are benzodiazepine agonists. In-vivo metabolism of adinazolam results in the formation of active metabolites.", 
    "23": "The effects of tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carbonic acid methyl ester (I), 1-phenyl-tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carbonic acid methyl ester (II), tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carbonic acid methylamide, and beta-carboline-3-carbonic acid methylamide on evoked potentials (EP) of neurons were investigated in experiments with hippocampal slices. Each compound was tested in 5 experiments. These derivatives applied in a concentration 4 M had the following features in common: 1) a 10-20% augmentation of the amplitude of the population spike (PS) evoked in the CAI area by Schaffer collaterals stimulation; 2) appearance of additional PSs; 3) potentiation of the substance effect after beginning of washing; 4) poor washing (incomplete recovery of EP after 40-60 min of washing). In one of five experiments, I administration led to a decrease in the PS amplitude (by 15%). A similar effect was observed in one of five experiments during perfusion of II. The authors assume that there are hippocampal mechanisms responsible for realization of opposite effects associated with occupation of benzodiazepine receptors by ligands.", 
    "24": "Phenazepam (I) and 3-hydroxymetabolite (II) interacting with cytochrome P-450 of the liver of rats administered phenobarbital and 3-methylcholantrene demonstrated the 2nd type of spectral changes in hemoprotein. The binding constants of I and II considerably differ, which points to the possibility of interaction of substrates with different areas of hemoproteins. The characteristic points (maximum, minimum, isobestic) of the cytochrome P-450 spectrum were displaced during II titration to the longwave region as compared with I. The calculation of electron density on the atoms of the heterocycle and aromatic nuclei of the molecules of I and II has shown that the differences in the spectra of I and II binding with cytochrome P-450 are determined by the distribution of electron density of their heterocycle.", 
    "25": "From a sample of 257 elderly patients, 93 subjects who had received benzodiazepine (mainly diazepam) prescriptions for one or more years were interviewed about their subjective perception of the drug's effects and their attitudes regarding its use. The subjects were predominantly women: mean age was 72 years. All subjects had begun use of benzodiazepine more than two years earlier, although some had since stopped using the drug; more than a third had used it for more than six years. About half of the subjects said they took no more of the drug than had been initially prescribed, and three quarters reported they took the medications only when a need was felt. The principal indication for use of benzodiazepines was described as tension. Those who were still taking the drug at the time of interview were more likely to live alone and to say that they had the same problems as when they began its use. None of the subjects who had discontinued use of the drugs had been aware of withdrawal symptoms, and there was no evidence that any subject had become addicted, although several expressed a fear of this. It appears that in this age group, prolonged use of benzodiazepine at low doses, with the patients regulating the quantity, is safe and may be helpful. Most subjects, even if not helped, always kept some of the drug at home in case they might need it.", 
    "26": "Tranquilizers of the benzodiazepine group (oxazepam and diazepam) enhanced the rate of self-stimulation elicited from the lateral hypothalamus. Both tranquilizers induced reversal of escape and avoidance behaviors elicited from the medial hypothalamus to a high rate self-stimulation. The reversal effect persisted for two days and the initial negative emotional responses returned later as the drugs were depleted in the organisms. Thus the effect of minor tranquilizers substantially mimics the ventral hippocampus ablation effect which also produced the reversal of the medial hypothalamus responses in earlier experiments.", 
    "27": "Several doses of tifluadom, an opioid benzodiazepine with affinity for opioid kappa receptors, were tested on analgesia and locomotor activity in two strains of mice, the C57BL/6 and the DBA/2. The analgesic properties of the compound were confirmed in both strains by a tail flick test. As concerns locomotor activity both strains, that in previous researches showed opposite responses to opiates, were depressed by tifluadom, suggesting the involvement of kappa receptors in this effect.", 
    "28": "The anticonvulsive activity of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester (CCK-8-SE), non-sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-NS) and three different N- and C-terminal fragments were investigated against seizures induced by picrotoxin and electroshock in rats after intracerebroventricular administration. Doses of 0.8 and 80 pmol of CCK-8-SE and CCK-8-NS significantly enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin and shortened the duration of the clonic phase of the seizures induced by electroshock. Only CCK-8-SE shortened the recovery time and only 0.8 pmol of CCK-8-SE could shorten the duration of the tonic phase of convulsions induced by electroshock. Doses of the octapeptides of 8000 pmol were ineffective, with the exception of CCK-8-NS in the picrotoxin test. Of the fragments tested, the C-terminal tetrapeptide, CCK-5-8, enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin in a dose of 0.8 pmol, and had a dose-dependent biphasic effect on the duration of the clonic phase of seizures induced by electroshock. Intracerebroventricular administration of diazepam enhanced only the latency of tremor and clonic seizures induced with picrotoxin in a dose of 40 nmol. Twelve nmole of diazepam shortened the clonic phase of convulsions induced by electroshock. The peptides tested were much more active than diazepam, and their effective doses were comparable to the amounts of cholecystokinin octapeptide found in brain structures.", 
    "29": "One-electron reduction of the aromatic nitro-containing drug, clonazepam, by rat hepatic microsomes was found to produce a nitro anion radical which was observable by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry under anaerobic conditions. It was determined that NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase may be the enzyme responsible for this reduction and that this free radical reacts rapidly with oxygen to produce superoxide. The vasodilator nifedipine, another aromatic nitro-containing drug, was found not to be reduced by rat hepatic microsomes to a free radical nor to stimulate superoxide production. Based on a series of experiments, we propose that the inability of nifedipine to be bioreduced to its nitro anion free radical is the result of geometric restrictions which prevent the transfer of an electron from cytochrome P-450 reductase to nifedipine.", 
    "30": "Peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites have been studied in human and rat platelets and platelet membranes by using PK 11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl propyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide) as a ligand. [3H]PK 11195 binding to the intact cells and membranes is saturable, with a high affinity and presents the pharmacological specificity corresponding to the peripheral binding sites (PK 11195 greater than RO5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam). [3H]PK 11195 affinity is not affected by cell lysis, but there is a loss of binding capacity, contrarily to RO5-4864 whose affinity is greatly diminished. For this reason [3H]RO5-4864 binding can only be demonstrated in intact cells. Furthermore opposite to RO5-4864, PK 11195 affinity is not decreased by increasing temperatures. No difference was found between binding parameters (KD and Bmax) for [3H]PK 11195 between normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The very high binding capacity of human and rat platelets (Bmax greater than pmole/10(8) cells) makes them a good biological model for studying the physiological significance of \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "31": "Nearly 40 percent of Americans complain about insomnia. Such complaints are even more common among the elderly, possibly because sleep efficiency decreases with age. As a result, the use of hypnotics in this age group is high--sometimes too high. Hypnotics can be addictive, and many have a low therapeutic index. The benzodiazepine agents are safest for use in the elderly. Many elderly patients exhibit a marked increase in sensitivity to these hypnotics.", 
    "32": "Benzodiazepine receptors were studied in rats with hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure induced by galactosamine. [3H]-Diazepam binding studies on brain synaptic membranes of rats with mild and severe encephalopathy show a significant increase in the number of receptors in both stages of coma. [3H]Diazepam binding to synaptic membrane preparations from rats in the mild or severe stage of encephalopathy hyper-responded to the stimulatory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) applied in vitro at doses which for control rat preparations were in a subthreshold range. The effect of GABA was shown to be specific, since it was blocked by bicuculline methiodide. The sensitivity of benzodiazepine receptors in hepatic encephalopathy to nanomolar concentrations of GABA, which induced a significant increase in their affinity, seems to indicate a functional supersensitivity of benzodiazepine receptors in vivo in both mild and severe stages of encephalopathy. The phenomena described may be attributed to a partial degeneration of nerve terminals in hepatic encephalopathy, leading to a supersensitivity of benzodiazepine receptors, which parallels the previously described denervation supersensitivity of GABA receptors present in this animal model of fulminant hepatic failure. These findings may account for the brain hypersensitivity to sedatives administered to patients with liver diseases. The administration in vivo of a benzodiazepine antagonist, 2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]-quinolin-3(5H)-one, counteracted the hypersensitivity of benzodiazepine receptors in the mild stage of encephalopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Central and peripheral responses to restraint stress were evaluated in 90-day-old rats exposed prenatally to diazepam (1.0, 2.5, or 10.0 mg/kg/day) over gestational days 13-20. As a measure of a central response to stress, the utilization of norepinephrine (NE) by hypothalamic NE neurons was assessed by determining the effect of stress on the loss of NE after synthesis inhibition. The stress-induced changes in plasma corticosterone and prolactin levels were evaluated as a physiologic index of stress. While stress increased the loss of NE after synthesis inhibition in the non-exposed control animals, it totally prevented any loss of NE after synthesis inhibition in offspring prenatally exposed to DZ. Additionally, the stress-induced change in plasma corticosterone was attenuated in a dose-related manner by prenatal exposure to DZ. The stress-induced change in plasma prolactin was also altered in a dose-related manner by the prenatal exposure. Both the altered response to stress within hypothalamic NE neurons and the attenuated change in plasma corticosterone induced by prenatal exposure to DZ (2.5 mg/kg) were prevented by concurrent administration of the centrally acting benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 to the pregnant dam, indicating that the effects of DZ were mediated via binding of the drug to central sites during gestation. These results indicate that activation of specific binding sites during early development can induce neural alterations in the adult offspring which can be reflected in functional changes which may compromise the organism.", 
    "34": "The antimuscarinic properties of pirenzepine and N-methylatropine were evaluated in two intact preparations by measuring A) the inhibition of increase in mean arterial pressure evoked by McN-A-343 in pithed rats through activation of ganglionic muscarinic receptors and B) the inhibition of fall in arterial pressure evoked by methacholine in anaesthetized rats through activation of vascular muscarinic receptors. To characterize the antimuscarinic potencies of pirenzepine and N-methylatropine, for both antagonists doses were calculated that produce a 10-fold shift to the right of the dose-response curves for A) the pressor response to McN-A-343 (i.v. administration) in pithed rats (D10-p.r.) and B) for the depressor effect to methacholine (i.v. administration) in anaesthetized rats (D10-an.r.), respectively. Whereas N-methylatropine was virtually equieffective in blocking both muscarinic responses (D10-an.r./D10-p.r. approximately equal to 1), pirenzepine, however, was considerably more potent at ganglionic than at vascular muscarinic receptors (D10-an.r./D10-p.r. approximately equal to 16). These data confirm the existence of excitatory ganglionic muscarinic receptors with high affinity for pirenzepine (M1) and provide evidence for the presence of M2 receptors - receptors which show a low sensitivity to pirenzepine - on vascular smooth muscle cells. To further characterize the anticholinergic properties of pirenzepine, its effect on the pressor response to DMPP, a nicotinic ganglionic stimulant, was investigated in pithed rats. A high dose of pirenzepine (1.13 mumol/kg), given i.v., did not affect nicotinic ganglionic transmission.", 
    "35": "An in vivo characterization of specific central type benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites, labelled with [11C]Ro 15-1788 was performed, using positron emission tomography. After i.v. injection of 10 mCi [11C]Ro 15-1788 (corresponding to 1 nmol/kg), sequential quantitative tomographic slices of the brain were obtained during 80 min. In some experiments various doses of different cold drugs (BZD agonist or antagonist) were injected i.v. subsequently in order to explore the specificity of the binding of the radioligand in brain structures. The main criteria usually utilized in vitro to demonstrate a specific binding to receptors, such as regional distribution, stereospecificity and saturability of the binding and pharmacological effect linked to the receptor's occupancy, were demonstrated in the brain of a living baboon.", 
    "36": "Premazepam (PRZ) in vitro competitively displaced 3H-diazepam (DIA), 3H-flunitrazepam (FLU) and 3H-RO 15-1788 from their binding sites on rat brain synaptosomes, with a potency intermediate to other benzodiazepines (BDZs), and Hill coefficients near 1 in different brain regions. Incubation at 37 degrees C reduced premazepam's affinity for BDZ receptors to a lower extent than other benzodiazepines and had no effect on the Hill coefficient. The IC50 of PRZ on 3H-RO 15-1788 and 3H-FLU binding was markedly reduced by GABA in rat cortex, like those of reference classical BDZs, but was GABA-independent in the cerebellum. The IC50 of the BDZ antagonist, RO 15-1788 was unaffected by GABA in both brain areas. The possibility that PRZ behaves as a partial agonist in the cortex and as an antagonist in the cerebellum is discussed.", 
    "37": "Diazepam in vitro produced a concentration-dependent increase of membrane fluidity in crude synaptic membranes from rat hippocampus, but not cerebellum. Similar effects were obtained with higher concentrations of Ro 15-1788 and PK 11195, while zopiclone was completely inactive. In vivo acute treatment with diazepam and Ro 15-1788 gave results similar to those in vitro. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist also significantly increased membrane fluidity and was not able to reverse diazepam's effect. The data are discussed in terms of a possible role of protein kinase inhibition by the drugs not mediated by the 'central' or 'peripheral' type of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "38": "The anticonvulsant action of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor partial agonist, ethyl 5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (ZK 91296) was studied in rats of Wistar origin exhibiting spontaneous bilateral cortical synchronous spike and wave discharges with a symptomatology paralleling that of human petit mal seizures. ZK 91296 1-16 mg/kg i.p.) attenuated the absence seizures without inducing signs of sedation or disorganized EEG patterns at any dose. Diazepam (1-8 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed seizures but also induced sedation and modified EEG background activity in a dose-related manner.", 
    "39": "Photoaffinity labeling of benzodiazepine sites with [3H]-flunitrazepam was examined using either long-wave (366 nm) or short-wave (254 nm) ultraviolet irradiation. A multiple exposure protocol was employed so that the time course of the process could be determined as well as the fraction of total sites labeled. At 366 nm, approximately 20% of the total sites present were labeled and the remainder showed reduced affinity for flunitrazepam, in agreement with published reports. When membranes from either cortex or cerebellum were irradiated at 254 nm, however, the fraction of sites labeled increased above 40%. The change in the ratio of labeled sites to those showing reduced affinity, as well as differences in the time courses of the two phenomena, are taken as evidence that the labeling and affinity change are independent processes rather than two effects of a single event. Inhibition of labeling by clonazepam and Ro15-1788 indicated the \"central\" nature of the labeled sites.", 
    "40": "Ro 5-4864 is a 1,4 benzodiazepine lacking typical benzodiazepine behavioural actions, and which has very low affinity for the \"classical\" CNS benzodiazepine binding sites. However, Ro 5-4864 has very high affinity for the peripheral type of binding site in the periphery and in the brain. Evidence is reviewed that Ro 5-4864 is sedative, convulsant and anxiogenic in rodents. We also describe the effects of combining Ro 5-4864 treatment with benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) and with other drugs that modify the activity of benzodiazepines (Ro 15-1788, CGS 8216, picrotoxin, PK 11195, phenytoin). The binding sites that might be mediating these behavioural actions of Ro 5-4864 are discussed.", 
    "41": "The binding interactions of some aryl carboxylic acid derivatives have been examined by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. With specific probes, we have shown that the seven ligands under study bind primarily to the benzodiazepine site on HSA. Their association constants are in the range of 10(5)-10(6) M-1 as found by spectropolarimetric titration, and appear to be closely related to some chemical features. It is concluded that the binding is enhanced by the lengthening of the carbon chain substituent with a terminating carboxyl moiety and by halogen substitution in the aromatic rings. It is further shown that hydrophilic substitutions such as hydroxyl or ketone groups in the carbon chain substituent will decrease the binding.", 
    "42": "As part of an investigation into whether alpha 1-foetoprotein (alpha 1-FP) plays the same transport role in foetal serum as albumin does in the adult, the binding properties of both proteins were compared with respect to the binding of a series of compounds known to be bound by albumin's specific drug-binding sites. The binding of warfarin, phenylbutazone, azapropazone, diazepam, digitoxin and cholic acid by rat alpha 1-FP and serum albumin was studied by equilibrium dialysis at 4 degrees C. Rat alpha 1-FP was shown to have neither albumin's high-affinity site II (diazepam as marker) nor its site III (digitoxin and cholic acid as markers). High-affinity binding by alpha 1-FP was found for the specific markers (warfarin, phenylbutazone, azapropazone) of albumin's drug-binding site I. However, instead of albumin's one high-affinity site/molecule, a mean value of 0.5 site/molecule was obtained with rat alpha 1-FP. Charcoal treatment at neutral pH of rat serum albumin did not affect its measured binding properties, but treatment of the alpha 1-FP led to an increased affinity for warfarin, phenylbutazone and azapropazone without a change in the measured number of sites, indicating competition for binding at this site by (an) endogenous ligand(s). These results are discussed in terms of the structures of the two proteins and with respect to the physiological implications of the differences found.", 
    "43": "The effects of various doses of the potent and specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were investigated in rats with spontaneous non convulsive, petit mal-like seizures. In preliminary experiments, Ro 15-1788, 2 mg/kg i.p., completely but transiently antagonized the antiepileptic action of diazepam, 2 mg/kg i.p. Ro 15-1788, 2 mg/kg, given alone, exhibited no intrinsic activity. At 10-80 mg/kg, it acted as an antiepileptic; this dose-dependent suppressant effect developed slowly over 20-40 min after injection and was never total even at 80 mg/kg. At the highest dose, Ro 15-1788 also had a transient epileptogenic effect immediately following the injection. These results confirm that Ro 15-1788 is not a pure benzodiazepine antagonist but also has partial 'agonist' and 'inverse agonist' properties.", 
    "44": "Barbiturates and the related depressant drugs, etazolate and etomidate, inhibited both the binding of [3H]bicuculline methochloride (BMC) to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor sites and the binding of [3H] beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (beta CCM) to benzodiazepine receptor sites in mammalian brain. These concentration-dependent effects were chemically specific and stereospecific in a manner correlating with the activity of barbiturates to enhance GABA responses in neurons and to enhance GABA and benzodiazepine receptor agonist binding in vitro. The barbiturate inhibition of [3H]BMC binding involved a decrease in affinity which at high concentrations of barbiturates results in an effective complete loss of detectable binding. The maximal inhibition of [3H] beta CCM binding involved a more modest decrease in affinity (increase in KD from 1.35 to 1.85 nM). The barbiturate inhibitions of both ligands could be reversed by picrotoxin, suggesting an indirect action at previously defined picrotoxin/barbiturate modulatory sites on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ion channel complex.", 
    "45": "Peptic ulcers can be treated successfully with antisecretory drugs and drugs which have a protective effect. Thanks to their good tolerance and a form of administration acceptable to patients, the H2-receptor antagonists have won a leading position amongst the other ulcer therapeutics. It remains to be seen whether the substituted benzimidazoles will develop into a serious competitor. Until now the clinical experiences with the prostaglandins in the treatment of ulcers are not very encouraging.", 
    "46": "Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are used to confirm the points of attachment of anthramycin to DNA. Using 13C NMR spectroscopy, the C-11 resonance of anthramycin is shown to undergo a 16-ppm upfield shift upon formation of a covalent bond with DNA, indicative of an aminal linkage at that position. The site of attachment on the DNA is determined using the self-complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide d-(ApTpGpCpApT) as a DNA model. Proton NMR, both in H2O and D2O solutions, provides a direct characterization of the anthramycin-oligonucleotide adduct. Upon covalent attachment to the duplex, a loss in the helical symmetry is observed, resulting in a doubling of several of the oligonucleotide resonances. Examination of the data confirms that the point of attachment of the anthramycin to the d-(ApTpGpCpApT) is at the guanine-NH2-position, consistent with the model proposed by Hurley and Petrusek (Hurley, L. H., and Petrusek, R. L. (1979) Nature (Lond.) 282, 529-531) and Petrusek et al. (Petrusek, R. L., Anderson, G. L., Garner, T. F., Fannin, Q. L., Kaplan, D. J., Zimmer, S. G., and Hurley, L. H. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1111-1119).", 
    "47": "In binding studies with rat brain membranes, 1,4-benzodiazepines containing a trifluoroethyl moeity at the 1-N position, including halazepam and quazepam, had significantly higher affinities for binding sites in cerebellum than in cortex. This selectivity for cerebellar sites is not a property of benzodiazepines without the trifluoroethyl moiety, but is similar to that seen with the triazolopyridazines. Since halazepam and quazepam, like the triazolopyridazines, have behavioral effects in animals at doses much lower than those that cause ataxia, it is tempting to attribute this separation of pharmacologic activities to differential activity at subpopulations of benzodiazepine receptors. Further work is necessary to clarify this possibility.", 
    "48": "Cerebral cortex membranes from rats habituated to manipulations preceding decapitation (habituated rats) had 40% higher GABA binding than membranes from naive animals. Diazepam (5 X 10(-6) M), added to membranes from naive rats, increased GABA binding to the level of habituated rats, but failed to induce any further increase in membranes from the latter animals. Vice versa, beta-carbolines (FG 7142, beta-CCE, DMCM) added to membranes from habituated rats lowered GABA binding to the level of naive animals, but caused no further decrease in the membranes from this last group. Diazepam removed the effect of beta-carbolines in membranes from habituated rats. It is suggested that handling represents a stressful stimulus for naive animals and that stress lowers GABA binding by releasing an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors possessing similar properties to beta-carbolines. Finally, the results indicate that the emotional status of animals from which brain tissue is obtained should be considered when connections between GABA and benzodiazepine receptors are studied.", 
    "49": "The effects of naloxone and picrotoxin were determined alone and in conjunction with pentobarbital, diazepam or clonazepam, in pigeons responding under a multiple fixed-ratio 30-response, fixed-interval 5-min schedule of food presentation. Naloxone (10.0-80.0 mg/kg i.m.) and picrotoxin (0.1-0.56 mg/kg i.m.) alone produced only dose-related decreases in responding in both fixed-ratio and fixed-interval components. Pentobarbital (3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg i.m.) administered in combination with naloxone and picrotoxin shifted dose-response curves for both naloxone and picrotoxin to the right. In contrast, both diazepam (1.0-10.0 mg/kg p.o.) and clonazepam (0.3-3.0 mg/kg p.o.) attenuated the rate-decreasing effects of 0.56 mg/kg of picrotoxin, but not those of 80.0 mg/kg of naloxone. Dose-effect curves for naloxone and picrotoxin were then determined during daily administration of 10.0 mg/kg of diazepam. Dose-response curves for both naloxone and picrotoxin were shifted to the right under these conditions. These data support previous evidence that naloxone exerts gamma-aminobutyric acid-antagonistic effects in addition to its potent opioid-antagonistic effects.", 
    "50": "A water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, was used in 400 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, alone or in combination with pentazocine and compared with 68 patients given diazepam (Valium). In the last 200 patients the endoscopist used midazolam without the presence of an anaesthetist. The absence of injection pain was the most notable feature of midazolam. The degree of co-operation was similar in all groups but the operating conditions were significantly better when midazolam was combined with pentazocine. There was no significant difference in recovery times between the groups as assessed by the pegboard test. Midazolam is an acceptable alternative to diazepam for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.", 
    "51": "The effects of age, sex, and obesity on the kinetics of single intravenous (iv) and oral doses of midazolam were evaluated in healthy volunteers who received 2.5-5 mg of iv midazolam on one occasion and 5-10 mg orally on another. Kinetics were determined from multiple plasma midazolam concentrations measured during 24 h after dosage. Midazolam elimination half-life (t1/2) after iv dosage was significantly prolonged in elderly (aged 60-74 yr) versus young (24-33 yr) males (5.6 vs. 2.1 hours, P less than 0.01) and total clearance was significantly reduced (4.4 vs. 7.8 ml X min-1 X kg-1, P less than 0.01), leading to increased systemic availability of the oral dose (50% vs. 41%, P less than 0.05). However total volume of distribution calculated by the area method (Vd) (1.6 vs. 1.3 1/kg) and protein binding (3.5 vs. 3.4% unbound) did not differ between groups. Among women there were no significant differences between elderly (64-79 yr) and young (23-37 yr) volunteers in t1/2 (4.0 vs. 2.6 h), clearance (7.5 vs. 9.4 ml X min-1 X kg-1), Vd (2.1 vs. 2.0 1/kg), protein binding (3.7% vs. 3.7% unbound), or oral bioavailability (38% vs. 36%). In obese volunteers (mean weight 117 kg; 173% of ideal weight) versus control subjects of normal weight (66 kg, 95% of ideal weight) matched for age, sex, and smoking habits, midazolam Vd was increased significantly (311 vs. 114 1, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity was studied in specific brain regions of a newly identified genetic (rat) model of human torsion dystonia. GAD activity was found to be significantly increased in the deep cerebellar nuclei of dystonic rats at 16, 20, and 24 days of age. GAD activity in the other regions examined (vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus) did not differ from that of age-matched normal littermate controls. Diazepam treatment significantly reduced the frequency of dystonic movements in the mutant.", 
    "53": "The effect of sleep on quazepam kinetics was studied in 12 normal adult men. In a randomized two-way crossover design, each subject received one 15-mg quazepam tablet either at night just before sleep or in the morning after a night's sleep. Blood samples were drawn before and at specified times (to 120 hr) after dosing. To assure that blood collection did not interfere with sleep, blood was drawn by an indwelling catheter from a large arm vein. Plasma concentrations of quazepam and its two major plasma metabolites (which are also active) 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (N-desalkylflurazepam) were determined by specific GLC methods. Kinetic analysis was by a two-compartment open model with first-order absorption/formation kinetics. Quazepam was rapidly absorbed with both administration times; absorption t 1/2 was 0.7 to 0.9 hr. Absorption lag time was slightly longer after the nighttime dose (1.0 and 0.6 hr). Maximum concentration and AUC of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam and AUC of N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam were somewhat higher after nighttime dosing, most likely a result of decreased apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment after the nighttime dose (5.0 l/kg for nighttime dosing and 8.6 l/kg for morning dosing). The elimination t 1/2s of quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam, and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam after the morning dose were 25, 28, and 79 hr, which did not differ from those values after the nighttime dose. In general, time of dosing had no appreciable effect on quazepam kinetics or those of its major active plasma metabolites. The small differences between the two dose times are not expected to have clinical significance.", 
    "54": "The effects of diazepam premedication and administration of an epinephrine-containing local anesthetic on plasma catecholamine levels and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated prior to and during a minor surgical procedure, the removal of impacted third molars. Significant elevations in circulating epinephrine levels (203% above control) and cardiac output (30%) were seen in unsedated patients after administration of lidocaine with epinephrine before surgery, while no changes were seen after lidocaine alone. Unsedated patients had increased norepinephrine (24%) and epinephrine (57%) levels during surgery. Diazepam premedication decreased norepinephrine levels 29% below preoperative levels, followed by an increase during surgery to preoperative levels. These results indicate that intraoral injections of epinephrine-containing local anesthetics result in increased circulating epinephrine levels that are associated with cardiovascular changes and that diazepam premedication decreases plasma norepinephrine levels and attenuates the sympathoadrenal response to surgical stress.", 
    "55": "Pirenzepine (P) exerts cytoprotective action through a mechanism so far poorly understood. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the protective effect of P and by comparison PGE2, in different cytoprotective models: NaOH 0.2 N; antral ulcer induced by indomethacin; and in an \"in vivo\" model using ethanol (50% 1ml/rat p.o.) as mucosal barrier damaging agent. In this last group of experiments gastric mucosal potential difference (DP), Na+ concentrations and pH were measured. These parameters provided a clear measure of the mucosal barrier recovery from damaging agents. P., like PGs, significantly protect mucosa against NaOH 0.2 N induced ulcers with an ED50 = 21.94 mg/kg os, a similar activity was found for the antral ulcers induced by indomethacin (ED50 22.06 mg/kg os). Moreover P. significantly antagonized the PD reduction induced by ethanol in rat. PGE2 was strikingly active in this model. P. and PGE2 significantly decreased also Na+ ion concentration altered by ethanol. Although this paper shows a positive effect of P on the gastric mucosal barrier, further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism of gastric cytoprotection of P.", 
    "56": "Drug abuse appears destined to become an exacerbating cultural phenomenon despite intrinsic dangers to the abuser and accelerating costs to society. Dentists cannot afford to ignore the problem or its sequelae either in terms of their personal involvement or in terms of the clinical implications of such a practice for their patients. Abuse of agents, such as opioids and amphetamines, by the dental practitioner leads to devastating personal, social, and professional consequences. The abuser jeopardizes his or her reputation, family relationships, professional practice, and, not uncommonly, his or her very life through accidental overdose of drugs or by suicide. Nitrous oxide abuse is particularly prevalent among dentists and, although producing no psychological dependence, may result in long-term myeloneuropathy and physical disability making continued dental practice impossible. The dentist's responsibilities in this area lie within clinical and social domains. Clinically, the dentist must (1) learn to detect those physical and behavioral signs in patients that are indicators of drug abuse; (2) become familiar with tactics employed by drug abusers to obtain drugs for themselves or for further criminal diversion, and be prepared to defend against such tactics; (3) understand and make clinical allowance for therapeutic complications that may arise in the treatment of drug-abuse patients. The dentist's social role as an informed, concerned, and empathic counselor in matters of drug abuse must be assumed as a personal imperative and not viewed as an intellectual abstraction. Whenever we are made aware of the drug-related devastation or death of a friend, colleague, or student, we discern the immediacy of an ethical responsibility of social dimensions, so eloquently expressed over 350 years ago, by John Donne in his \"Devotions XVII\": \"No man is an island, ... Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee\".", 
    "57": "The information presented in this article suggests that the drug responses of the elderly may be greater than those in the young or essentially the same. We have presented evidence that the pharmacokinetics in the elderly would probably tend toward prolonging the half-life and delaying the clearance of many drugs. Pharmacodynamic changes are more ambiguous, increasing sensitivity to some drugs and decreasing sensitivity to others. Compliance errors, from whatever cause, lead to unpredictable intake of drugs. Psychosocioeconomic factors contribute to compliance errors and no doubt also lead to increased intake of combination of drugs. Multiple diseases are common among the elderly, but it is not clear how disease states, per se, affect drug responses unless the specifically diseased organ is focally important in the handling of drugs. Alterations in perception of pain and in reflex and immune competence will produce changes in all directions. Use of multiple drugs almost certainly will create an environment favorable to drug interactions and adverse reactions. What is the dentist to do with these conflicting effects of aging in drug therapy? There are a few, and only a few, rules that can be said to have a solid basis in fact. Elderly patients seem to be more sensitive to the depressant effects of drugs. It is wise, therefore, to reduce the dosage of such drugs as the benzodiazepines, general anesthetics, analgesics, and sedative-hypnotics in the elderly. Old people are apparently more sensitive to certain drugs, for example, the neuromuscular blocking drugs. It would be wise to reduce the dosage of these for the older patient. The geriatric person appears to be less sensitive to pain; it would be wise to prescribe analgesics for such patients in lower doses. Elderly patients are known to have lost some of their reflex ability to maintain homeostasis. This should be taken into consideration when drugs that affect blood pressure, heart rate, and smooth muscle tone are used. Elderly patients are almost certain to be taking multiple medications. Drug interactions, as well as adverse drug reactions (which are exaggerated in the elderly), are likely to occur in this polypharmaceutical setting. It is critical that the dentist be continually informed of the pharmacologic status of each patient and be aware of the likelihood of interactions between drugs prescribed by the dentist, drugs-prescribed by the physician, and drugs that are self-administered.", 
    "58": "During the course of dental treatment, when it is necessary to prescribe pharmacologic agents for the pediatric patient, a drug should be selected that is not only effective but also available in a readily acceptable form. Dosages should be considered carefully. Rather than attempting to adjust adult recommendations, established guidelines for children should be utilized. Manufacturer's doses should be followed when available. If a child frustrates efforts toward treatment and does not respond to nonpharmacotherapeutic management approaches, premedication should be considered. The practitioner should have a thorough medical history before deciding to employ outpatient sedation. This history can be helpful in selecting the most appropriate regimen. Very young children and severely compromised patients are not good candidates for sedation and are best treated under general anesthesia. Narcotic analgesics are rarely indicated for control of pain following dental treatment in children. Nonnarcotic preparations are very effective and will suffice for most procedures. Because prolonged bleeding has been demonstrated, aspirin should be used with caution in surgical cases. Oral administration is recommended for most dental infections requiring antibiotics. In instances when severe infection is encountered, the parenteral route is suggested. A narrow-spectrum, bactericidal agent is preferred; barring allergy, penicillin is the usual drug of choice. When antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, adherence to American Heart Association guidelines is strongly encouraged.", 
    "59": "It was demonstrated that baclofen, a GABA-ergic agent, exerted a sedative effect in rats with tolerance to the sedative action of oxazepam and nitrazepam induced by administration of these drugs during several weeks. After one dose baclofen alone reduced the motor activity of rats without potentiating the effects of benzodiazepines. During long-term administration of baclofen tolerance developed also to its sedative action.", 
    "60": "Intraspecies experience of domination or subordination in mice is an important factor predetermining their specific behaviour in response to painful stimuli, The significance is emphasized of ethological investigations for studying behavioural reactivity to pain and correct differentiation of responses of \"defence-subordination\" and \"aggression-offence\" types.

    "61": "The behavioral effect of brotizolam was investigated in mice and rats, in comparison with those of diazepam, nitrazepam and estazolam. Locomotor activity of rats in an open field situation was slightly increased with smaller doses of brotizolam and estazolam and with larger doses of nitrazepam, while it was decreased with large doses of brotizolam and estazolam. The anticonflict effect of brotizolam in rats was approximately as potent as that of diazepam and was augmented following chronic administration for 10 days. In suppressing hyperemotionality and muricide of olfactory bulbectomized rats, brotizolam was more potent than diazepam, being approximately equipotent to nitrazepam and estazolam. Brotizolam, diazepam, nitrazepam and estazolam prevented both maximal electroshock and pentetrazol convulsions in mice, the effects on the latter being much more potent than those on the former. In impairing rotarod performance, brotizolam was as potent as estazolam and nitrazepam and was much more potent than diazepam in mice, but was less potent than estazolam and nitrazepam in rats. These results indicate that brotizolam possesses pharmacological properties characteristic to benzodiazepines and that the activity is more potent than that of diazepam and approximately as potent as those of nitrazepam and estazolam.", 
    "62": "Metabolism and intracellular distribution of 14C-phenazepam and its derivatives were studied in rat and mice liver tissue. Phenazepam was found mainly in microsomal fraction of the animal hepatocytes, where rapid turnover of the substance occurred. The metabolites formed were uniformly distributed in the cell and penetrated into other tissues. The rates of phenazepam metabolites conjugation and binding with proteins were dissimilar in rat and mice tissues. Metabolism of phenazepam was shown to depend on doses of the drug administered. Incorporation of phenazepam into liposomes affected distinctly its turnover in mice tissues.", 
    "63": "A single dose open labelled two-way randomized crossover study was used to assess the pharmacokinetics of diazepam from a controlled release capsule relative to standard release tablets in elderly volunteers. Eighteen volunteers received a single 15 mg controlled release capsule or a 5 mg tablet t.i.d. on one day. Diazepam plasma concentrations were determined at specific times over a 96-h interval by an electron capture-gas chromatographic method. Mean plateau plasma concentrations endured from 2 to 24 h avoiding the peak to trough fluctuations associated with conventional t.i.d. dosing. Similar areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values indicated equal extent of absorption between formulations and regimens. Comparing parameters in this same elderly population to a young adult population, previously administered the controlled release capsule, shows lower maximum concentrations and a longer plateau duration in the elderly volunteers. Although there is a twofold increase in the mean diazepam half-life in the elderly when compared to young adults, the estimated apparent volume of distribution increased proportionately with half-life to maintain a constant clearance. Thus, the total body clearance of diazepam appears to be age independent. The age-dependent pharmacokinetics observed in this study are consistent with previously reported data involving diazepam. Overall, the controlled release capsule administered once daily mimics a t.i.d. regimen in elderly volunteers.", 
    "64": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (5 mg/kg) administered on four of eight sessions significantly impaired the performance of a previously learned, reinforcement-cued discrimination in male Sprague-Dawley rats. On four interspersed vehicle-injection sessions, the performance of subjects demonstrated immediate recovery and was indistinguishable from that of controls (0 mg/kg). An analysis of response components indicated that the impairment in discrimination performance was due to a \"disinhibitory\" effect of the drug on responding during \"no-go\" phases of the task. The results are discussed in the context of similarities and differences in the effect of CDP on performance and acquisition.", 
    "65": "Results of the identification of some additional products in the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of lorazepam are reported, together with some quantitative results about the hydrolysis products under varying circumstances. It appeared that the amount of byproducts was reduced by applying hydrochloric acid of good quality and further on hydrolysis time had to be short.", 
    "66": "\"Peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites were labelled in cat brain membranes by using [3H]PK 11195. This ligand binds to the \"peripheral type\" binding sites in a reversible, specific and saturable manner. Cat brain binding sites density (congruent to 6 pmol/mg prot.) was higher than in the rat. Pharmacological specificity was demonstrated by the potency order of displacing agents: PK 11195 greater than RO5-4864 greater than dipyridamole greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam. A similar characterization was performed in slide mounted brain sections where [3H]PK 11195 also labelled the \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites. The high percentage of specific binding (80%) at 1 nM of [3H]PK 11195 made possible the autoradiographic studies on binding sites distribution. These sites were heterogeneously distributed in the grey matter and absent in white matter. Visual, auditory and other specific sensory relay stations were highly labelled. The blood pressure regulating nuclei, the vestibulo-cerebellar and the extrapyramidal motor system also presented a very high binding density. As previously described in the rat brain, choroid plexus was also strongly labelled by [3H]PK 11195 in the cat.", 
    "67": "The present study is a survey of psychotropic drug use patterns among 1860 patients admitted to Padova General Hospital in North-East Italy. Our results show that 23% of the patients took psychotropic drugs for almost their entire stay in hospital. The drugs most commonly used are anxiolytics and hypnotics, both of the benzodiazepine class. The use of barbiturates as hypnotics has almost disappeared. Some significant correlations between the use of psychotropic drugs and socio-demographic factors were also found. Women, widows and widowers, retired and elderly persons seem to be at higher risk in the use of psychotropic drugs. The meaning and implications of these results are discussed.", 
    "68": "The effects of picrotoxin (2 and 4 mg/kg) and of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) were examined in a social-interaction test of anxiety. Picrotoxin (2 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in active social interaction, without a concomitant reduction in motor activity, indicating an anxiogenic action. Picrotoxin (4 mg/kg) and pentylenetrazole (20 mg/kg) reduced social interaction by more than 75% and motor activity by 40%. Although it is likely that the reduction in motor activity is secondary to the very low levels of social interaction, an unambiguous interpretation of an anxiogenic effect is not possible. Increased concentrations of corticosterone in plasma following administration of picrotoxin were consistent with the drug being anxiogenic. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) significantly reversed the reductions in social interaction and locomotor activity following injection of picrotoxin (4 mg/kg) and PTZ (20 mg/kg).", 
    "69": "Plasma levels of diazepam and its metabolites were compared after a controlled release formulation and a regular tablet. Both gas chromatographic analysis of plasma diazepam and desmethyldiazepam and radioreceptor assay of total benzodiazepine activity were used. Also the concentrations of benzodiazepine in saliva samples were analyzed by radioreceptor assay. A typical initial plasma peak was seen after the regular tablet but not after the controlled release capsule. Hence the excessive initial sedation can be avoided and the risk of abuse reduced. Desmethyldiazepam increased for about two days after a single dose of diazepam. The receptor assay correlated in general with the sum of diazepam and its desmethyl derivative. The saliva assay gave about 2.5% of the plasma total benzodiazepine which correlates well with the expected free benzodiazepine. It seems that both the plasma radioreceptor assay and the saliva assay can be used to monitor the total benzodiazepine concentration.", 
    "70": "Effects of pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide and ethanol were studied alone and in combination with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), IM, on punished behavior. Key-peck responses of pigeons were maintained by food presentation under a fixed-interval 3-min schedule in which every 30th response produced shock. Moderate doses of pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide and ethanol increased punished responding to 150-200% of control values while the higher doses of these drugs almost completely eliminated responding. TRH (0.01-1 mg/kg) had little effect on punished responding and 3 mg/kg produced 50% decreases. Although the lower doses of TRH were without effect when given alone, doses of 0.03 mg/kg and greater markedly potentiated the rate-increasing effects of pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide and ethanol. Increases in punished responding of 350% were obtained with combinations of TRH and these drugs. The rate-decreasing effects of the sedative-hypnotic and anxiolytic compounds were not reversed by TRH. Potentiation of the behavioral effects of sedative-hypnotic and anxiolytic drugs by TRH suggests that TRH may play an important role in modulating the behavioral effects of these compounds and that combinations of neuroactive peptides with certain psychotherapeutic agents may be of some therapeutic value.", 
    "71": "The anti-depressive effects of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and its analogues (DN-1417: gamma-butyrolactone-gamma-carbonyl-histidyl-prolinamide citrate; MK-771: L-pyro-2-aminoadipyl-histidyl-thiazolidine-4-carboxamide) were examined in behavioral despair rats, an animal model of depression. TRH, DN-1417, MK-771, amitriptyline and diazepam were injected three times after the first forced swimming. One hr after the last injection, a 5-min swimming test was performed. Experimental animals were placed in a Hall's type open-field apparatus immediately before and after the 5-min test, and their locomotor activities were determined. No significant difference was noted in the locomotor activity immediately before the 5-min test among any group. In the 5-min swimming test, TRH, DN-1417 and MK-771 caused a dose-dependent decrease in immobility, showing an anti-depressive effect similar to amitriptyline. Diazepam showed no difference compared with the control group. After the swimming test, locomotor activity remarkably decreased in the control rats, while decreased locomotor activity was partially prevented in the TRH, DN-1417, MK-771 and amitriptyline treated rats which exhibited active movement not only during the swimming period but also after it. In terms of the minimum effective dose, TRH and DN-1417 seemed to be of similar potency, while MK-771 was 40-fold stronger than TRH. An examination of a possible correlation between the cross-reactivity of TRH analogues in a radioreceptor assay and the effects of the analogues on despair rats suggested that the structure-binding relationship was proportional to the structure-activity relationship.", 
    "72": "This article reviews the agents used to treat manic patients. It has been suggested that up to 20 percent of all manic patients are refractory to lithium. We reviewed studies suggesting that drugs affecting the serotoninergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, and opioid neurotransmission systems, as well as anticonvulsants and others, are possible alternative treatments. Despite the large number of agents used, few large controlled studies carefully examine these interventions. Clinical assessments using specific manic rating scales are lacking in most studies. Among the successful alternative treatments reported, carbamazepine has received the most intensive research. Other suggested therapeutic agents, such as levothyroxine and clorgyline, require additional research to verify their effectiveness. From these pharmacological approaches and an understanding of the pathophysiology of mania, future therapeutic interventions can be formulated.", 
    "73": "Studies of the treatment of panic anxiety and various other states with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are critically reviewed. It is concluded that MAOIs have differential effects on several dimensions of pathologic anxiety. The association between depression and anxiety states is also reviewed; it is observed that MAOIs effectively treat severe anxiety and phobic disorders without operating strictly via their antidepressant mechanism. In addition, it is proposed that biologic depression and biologic anxiety should be considered to have some independence from one another. Guidelines for the clinical delineation of anxiety disorders are provided, and the clinical and research implications of the proposal for revision of DSM-III anxiety and phobic disorders section, are outlined in detail. It is suggested that anxiety and phobic disorders be classified into endogenous (disease) and exogenous (nondisease) types."
