    "0": "Triazolam was administered to five psychiatric inpatients for a two-week period. This period was preceded by a one-week placebo baseline and followed by another week of placebo administration. All conditions were double blind. By the second week of active drug administration, psychopathology greatly intensified across all of the patients with the emergence of anxiety, memory impairment, confusion, paranoid ideation, and hallucinations. The drug-induced behavioral changes persisted during the initial withdrawal period, but then gradually subsided. Also following drug withdrawal, four patients showed a marked worsening of their sleeplessness for several nights.", 
    "1": "Radioligand receptor binding might give more detailed information on the innervation pattern of the nasal mucosa and the character of the various neuroreceptors involved. With respect to the cholinergic receptors, this technique reveals that specific binding of tritiated I-quinuclidinyl benzilate to rat nasal mucosa homogenates occurs to a homogeneous class of binding sites, with a dissociation constant of 0.06 +/- 0.02 nM and a receptor density of 8 +/- 2 pmole/g of tissue. Binding is stereoselectively inhibited by benzetimide hydrochloride enantiomers. Pirenzepine displacement (inhibition constant = 0.5 X 10(-6) M) classifies tritiated I-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites as M2-muscarinic receptors. Methylfurthrethonium inhibits tritiated I-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding at high concentrations, pointing to the presence of low-affinity agonist binding sites, probably admixed with a small proportion of high-affinity agonist binding sites. These data obtained in the rat open new perspectives for studying muscarinic receptors in the human nose to elucidate the supposed disturbance of autonomic nerve regulation in nasal hyperreactivity.", 
    "2": "Effects of restraint stress on humoral immune responses were investigated in mice. Mice were restrained for 12 hours per day at nighttime and released at daytime for 2 consecutive days, either before or after sheep red blood cell (SRBC) immunization. The antibody response to SRBC was markedly suppressed in mice that were restrained before antigen injection. In contrast, the response was not significantly affected when the stress was loaded after immunization. Oral administration of 10 mg/kg diazepam prevented the stress-induced suppression of anti-SRBC antibody response. On the other hand, antibody responses to T cell-independent antigens such as trinitrophenylated (TNP)-Ficoll and TNP-lipopolysaccharide were not suppressed. These results suggest that the restraint stress causes dysfunction of T cell populations in mice.", 
    "3": "We have studied the effects of PGE2, the anticholinergic pirenzepine and vagotomy on the rat gastric mucosa after challenge with ASA+0.15N HCl or absolute ethanol. The damage was evaluated by quantitative macroscopic examination, light and electron (transmission and scanning examinations) microscopy. We found both macroscopically and microscopically that pirenzepine and PGE2 were effective against ASA+0.15N HCl, but under microscopic examination they were seen to be uneffective 1 hr after absolute ethanol. Vagotomy showed some protection against ASA+0.15N HCl but was totally uneffective against absolute ethanol. The results stress the differences between ASA+0.15N HCl and absolute ethanol damage and show that \"cytoprotection\" is possible when the mucosa is challenged with noxious agents that do not act by hyperosmolar effects.", 
    "4": "An analysis of three time phases--induction, maintenance, and recovery from anesthesia--is presented to clarify specific risk situations and the treatment necessary to decrease morbidity and mortality in the dental office.", 
    "5": "The action of single and repeated treatment with chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (5-10 mg/kg i.p.) and sodium valproate (VPA) (100-200 mg/kg i.p.) on water intake of rats adapted to a daily 23-h water deprivation schedule was investigated. The influence exerted by single or repeated treatment of the two drugs on the antidipsogenic effect of naloxone (Nx) (1 mg/kg s.c.) was studied too. Our results show that with single treatment of CDP the dipsogenic effect is lower and not further modified by increasing dose and by the time-course of the session; with repeated treatment the dipsogenic effect is greater and further enhanced by increasing dose and by the time-course of the session. Single or repeated treatment with VPA does not significantly affect the water intake. Single treatment of CDP enhances the antidipsogenic effect of Nx, while CDP, after repeated treatment, reverses the antidipsogenic effect of Nx. With VPA-Nx association, the response is univocal (antidipsogenic effect) independent of the experimental conditions. The results are briefly discussed.", 
    "6": "The effects of diazepam on pancreatic exocrine secretion were investigated in the vascularly isolated and self-hemoperfused dog pancreas under constant perfusion pressure of 100 mmHg. Close-arterial injections (i.a.) of diazepam (0.3-3.0 mg) caused dose-dependent increases in the secretion of pancreatic juice and in the rate of perfusion blood flow. Protein and bicarbonate concentrations of the pancreatic juice stimulated by 3.0 mg of diazepam were significantly higher than those of the resting pancreatic juice. The secretory activity of 1.0 mg (i.a.) of diazepam was comparable to that of 0.05 units (i.a.) of secretin. These secretory and vascular responses to diazepam were not modified by pretreatments with atropine, sulpiride, cimetidine, theophylline and Ro 15-1788. These results suggest that large doses of diazepam act directly on both acinar and ductular cells of the pancreas and induce protein and bicarbonate secretions.", 
    "7": "Three drugs which increase GABA-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, namely the GABA degradation inhibitors aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) and gamma-acetylenic GABA (GAG), and the GABA receptor agonist THIP (gaboxadol), were administered to epilepsy-prone gerbils via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps for 2 weeks. The antiepileptic drugs valproic acid (VPA) and diazepam were also included in the experiments. After one day of constant rate application, all GABAmimetics markedly suppressed seizure activity induced in the gerbils by air blast stimulation, but anticonvulsant efficacy of the drugs was lost after 8 and 14 days of treatment. With VPA, only moderate anticonvulsant effects were found because only sub-therapeutic drug levels (about 40 micrograms/ml plasma) were reached via minipump administration. The experiments with diazepam could only be evaluated in part because of instability of the drug in aqueous solution. Determination of brain GABA metabolism in the gerbils indicated that reduction of GABA synthesis may be responsible, at least in part, for development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of AOAA and GAG.", 
    "8": "The cardiopulmonary consequences of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, IV) followed by ketamine (10 mg/kg, IV) were evaluated in 11 dogs. Diazepam did not exhibit a tranquilizing effect and was frequently associated with excessive excitement. It produced minimal cardiopulmonary effects, except for a significant increase in heart rate. Ketamine administration was associated with less cardiovascular stimulation when administered after diazepam than it did when administered alone; the respiratory depression was greater. Compared with ketamine alone, the diazepam-ketamine combination was associated with more vomition, less muscle hypertonus, less seizure activity, and less salivation.", 
    "9": "The authors investigated the respiratory effects of diazepam in 24 healthy volunteers using a modified Read rebreathing circuit. Resting end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) and the slopes of the ventilatory (VE/PETCO2) and occlusion pressure (P0.1/PETCO2) response to CO2 were measured just prior to and 5, 20, 40, and 60 min after diazepam, 0.1 mg/kg iv. The slope of VE/PETCO2 for all 24 subjects analyzed as a single group was never significantly depressed. The slope of P0.1/PETCO2 for all 24 subjects analyzed as a single group was significantly depressed only at 5 min after diazepam. The resting PETCO2, however, had small but statistically significant increases throughout the 1 h of study. Group or cluster analysis of the slope of P0.1/PETCO2 clearly divided subjects into one group of five subjects, whose P0.1/PETCO2 slope was significantly and consistently augmented for 1 h and a second group of 19 subjects whose P0.1/PETCO2 slope was always less than control for the entire hour. Diazepam may, through effects on pulmonary mechanics and/or the central nervous system, sometimes enhance respiratory responses to CO2 rebreathing. Failure to select for such group effects when studying drug effects by CO2 rebreathing may obscure the severity and duration of respiratory depression that occurs in the majority of individuals. Resting PETCO2 indicated consistent depression of resting minute ventilation by diazepam and may be a more appropriate or sensitive measure of mild or subtle drug-induced respiratory effects.", 
    "10": "Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha by cultured antral and fundic gastric mucosa obtained from 86 patients with active duodenal ulcer who were not receiving medication was 50% lower (p less than 0.01) than their respective synthesis by cultured gastric mucosa in normal subjects. Antral and fundic prostanoid synthesis in patients receiving chronic therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was almost completely inhibited. The decreased synthesis of antral and fundic prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha in duodenal ulcer patients was not affected following ulcer healing achieved after 4 wk of therapy with placebo, arbacet, misoprostol, sucralfate, and pirenzepine. In contrast, following 4 wk of therapy with ranitidine, both antral and fundic prostaglandin E2 synthesis were significantly increased when compared with their respective synthesis before therapy. These results confirm that gastric prostanoid synthesis is decreased in patients with active duodenal ulcer and in subjects treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, suggesting that decreased endogenous prostanoid synthesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of mucosal damage. The induction of endogenous prostanoids by ranitidine may contribute to its therapeutic effect.", 
    "11": "Rats were trained to discriminate either chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 4 mg/kg, IP, N = 8) or pentobarbital (PB, 10 mg/kg, IP, N = 8) from saline in a two-lever food-reinforced procedure. CDP and PB dose-dependently substituted for each other (greater than or equal to 90% drug lever responses); indicating that their discriminative stimulus properties were closely similar. However, discriminative stimulus control induced by CDP and PB differentially was affected by the proposed benzodiazepine (BDZ) antagonists Ro 15-1788 (0.08-20 mg/kg, IP) and CGS 8216 (2.5-20 mg/kg, IP) in each experimental group; suggesting that the discriminative stimulus properties of CDP and PB are mediated by different mechanisms of action. When administered alone, Ro 15-1788 (5 and 20 mg/kg), but not CGS 8216, induced CDP like discriminative effects, suggesting that Ro 15-1788 may have partial (BDZ like) agonist properties, not shown by CGS 8216. Additional evidence for a behavioral difference between Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 is suggested by differential effects of both compounds on response rate. The results may reflect differential interactions of the compounds with the BDZ receptor-GABA receptor-Cl- ionophore complex.", 
    "12": "Ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE), inosine and Ro 15-1788 are antagonists of several actions of the benzodiazepines. These compounds can be differentiated, however, according to their ability to reverse the loss of the righting response induced by diazepam. Ro 15-1788 completely reversed effects of diazepam on the righting response of pigeons and squirrel monkeys but was ineffective against comparable effects produced by pentobarbital. Pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 protected against diazepam-induced righting loss. Neither inosine nor beta-CCE reversed diazepam-induced righting loss or acted prophylactically against this effect. Since beta-CCE has been characterized as an inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, the absence of antagonism we report would suggest that beta-CCE lacks specific pharmacological activity which opposes suppression of the righting response by diazepam. Research with these preferentially-acting antagonists may lead to the development of anxiolytics devoid of the sedative-hypnotic properties inherent in the drugs currently in a clinical use.", 
    "13": "The effects of anticonvulsant and proconvulsant benzodiazepine-receptor ligands were studied in infant rats. The agonist flurazepam increased myoclonic twitching of the limbs as has previously been reported. In contrast, the convulsant beta-carbolines DMCM and beta-CCM did not produce twitching, but did produce marked increases in locomotor activity and whole body shakes. The standard convulsants pentylenetetrazol and bicuculline similarly increased locomotor activity and shaking. These findings suggest that the effects of agonist benzodiazepines cannot be interpreted as convulsant-type behaviour. In addition, the finding that DMCM and beta-CCM have equivalent effects despite showing preferential affinities for benzodiazepine-receptor subtypes argues against one particular subtype having proconvulsant effects.", 
    "14": "The effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) beta-carboline carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) and its free acid on the protective effects of diazepam against leptazol- and R05-3663-induced convulsions were investigated in mice and compared with their effects on the antileptazol effect of sodium valproate, in an attempt to demonstrate a specific central effect of beta-CCE on benzodiazepine function. The results show that a small dose (1 microgram) of beta-CCE but not its free acid (in doses of up to 100 micrograms) was able to reverse the protective effects of diazepam against leptazol- and R05-3663-induced convulsions, whereas the effects of sodium valproate, a nonbenzodiazepine anticonvulsant, could not be reversed by these beta-carboline derivatives.", 
    "15": "A consummatory conflict procedure that involves an abrupt reduction in magnitude of an expected reward (negative contrast) has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of anxiolytic agents. As previously reported with chlordiazepoxide, another benzodiazepine (BDZ), midazolam released suppressed consummatory performance in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was not due to a general appetitie stimulatory effect of the drug. The effects of three 5-HT antagonists on negative contrast were examined to evaluate the role serotonin may play in the anxiolytic action of BDZ. Methysergide was found to be ineffective, cinanserin tended to reduce contrast at two intermediate doses, and cyproheptadine eliminated the contrast effect in a similar fashion as midazolam. The effectiveness of cyproheptadine may not be attributed to its anticholinergic or antihistaminergic actions since scopolamine and pyrilamine did not produce similar effects. The results are discussed in terms of the role serotonin may play in the anti-conflict action of BDZ, as well as possible interactional effects of GABA.", 
    "16": "The experiments on male mice and rats have revealed reversed behavioral effects of muscimol and Ro 15-1788 after 15 days of haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg, twice daily) treatment. Muscimol (0.75 mg/kg), which depressed motor activity in saline-pretreated mice, stimulated it after discontinuation of long-term haloperidol administration. Ro 15-1788 stimulating effect in saline-pretreated rats gave way to sedative effect following haloperidol withdrawal. Simultaneously, the number of 3H-muscimol and 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites was decreased in forebrain, but increased in hindbrain. It was suggested that GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors in forebrain and hindbrain play opposite (inhibiting and stimulating, respectively) functional roles in the regulation of behaviour.", 
    "17": "The new benzodiazepine triazolam was given to six initially awake dogs maintained with spinal anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for O2 (CMRO2) were significantly reduced after the initial dose of 0.1 mg X kg-1 triazolam, and the EEG changed from an awake to a sleep pattern in less than 20 s. CMRO2 was gradually reduced with increasing doses of triazolam (0.3, 1.0, 10.0 and 30.0 mg X kg-1) to 76% of control after the final 30 mg X kg-1 dose. CBF did not decrease further after the initial dose, and the addition of N2O after the final dose did not cause any significant change in CBF or CMRO2. The dogs were hemodynamically stable during the study. Small increases in brain lactate and pyruvate levels, but not in the L/P ratio were the only significant changes in brain metabolite levels. Triazolam appears to be a safe and rapidly acting induction agent in the dog.", 
    "18": "The pharmacokinetics of a fixed dose of midazolam (0.3 mg kg-1 i.v.) were studied in detail in 115 healthy patients or volunteers and nine were found with a prolonged elimination half-life. A further 102 patients had an abbreviated pharmacokinetic study, of whom five showed a similar abnormality. Defective hepatic metabolism of midazolam may be a factor in the aetiology of what appears to be a true phenomenon, occurring in 6% of over 200 fit subjects given a standard dose of the drug.", 
    "19": "Midazolam and the emulsion formulation of diazepam were compared in a cross-over study in 50 patients undergoing out-patient conservative dentistry, with particular regard to sedation and the quality of recovery. Both agents proved effective, but sedation was achieved more rapidly with midazolam (P = 0.001) and was more effective (P less than 0.02). Significantly greater anterograde amnesia for the dental procedure (P less than 0.001) and a more rapid return to normal activities (P less than 0.02) were found with midazolam. Psychometric testing, however, failed to show any objective differences between the treatments. A mean dose of midazolam 0.14 mg kg-1 was required to achieve sedation equating to 0.29 mg kg-1 of diazepam, although there was considerable variation between individual patients.", 
    "20": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of a new imidazo-pyridine derivative, alpidem (SL80.0342) and the 1,4 benzodiazepine lorazepam were investigated utilizing quantitative EEG and psychometric testing. Ten normal volunteers received randomized (latin square) single oral doses of placebo, 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg alpidem and 2.5 mg lorazepam at weekly intervals. Blood level sampling, EEG recordings, evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side-effects were carried out at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours post drug; psychometric and psychophysiological investigations at the same time periods except for the first hour. Computer-assisted spectral-analysis of the EEG demonstrated an anxiolytic profile after both compounds, characterized by an increase of beta activity, decrease of alpha activity and acceleration of the centroid of the total activity and total beta activity. Total power was attenuated, delta activity augmented and the centroid of the combined delta and theta activities decreased. The latter changes were most pronounced after 2.5 mg lorazepam suggesting it is more sedative than alpidem. Dose/treatment efficacy calculations revealed 2.5 mg lorazepam as the most CNS-active compound, followed by 100 mg, 50 mg and 25 mg alpidem. Based on a multivariate analysis 2.5 mg lorazepam could be differentiated from placebo at all times, 100 mg alpidem in the first, second and fourth hours, 50 mg only in the second hour. Time-efficacy calculations showed a marked CNS effect after alpidem in the first hour with a peak in the second hour, a gentle decline to the fourth hour and thereafter a rapid decline up to the eighth hour. In contrast, 2.5 mg lorazepam showed a slower rise in CNS activity which peaked in the fourth hour and declined slowly thereafter. These pharmacodynamic effects paralleled the blood level course of both compounds, as well as the time-course of psychometric changes. The latter were characterized by a deterioration in psychometer function after 2.5 mg lorazepam, which was less pronounced after 100 mg alpidem, while 50 mg and 25 mg showed no significant difference from placebo. Subjective ratings of mood showed a decrement which was most pronounced after 100 mg alpidem, less so after 50 mg, with no difference from placebo after 25 mg or lorazepam. Finally, there were no significant inter-drug differences with regard to psychophysiological variables.", 
    "21": "The mechanism by which a substance that binds to the benzodiazepine receptor acts as an agonist, an inverse agonist (e.g. methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM] or an antagonist (e.g. Ro 15-1788) was investigated. For this purpose, we studied the influence of bicuculline, an antagonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), on the binding of these substances in crude synaptosomal preparation (P2 fraction) containing high levels of endogenous GABA. Displacement curves were performed, using 3H-flunitrazepam in the absence and in the presence of a high concentration (7.10(-5) M) of bicuculline. The ratios of IC50 values with and without bicuculline were significantly higher than 1 for all benzodiazepine agonists investigated (e.g. 1.91 +/- 0.11 (n = 3) for diazepam), about 1 for Ro 15-1788 (0.94 +/- 0.06 (n = 4)) and lower than 1 for beta-CCE (0.55 +/- 0.05 (n = 4)). Statistically significant differences were also observed among benzodiazepine agonists e.g. between flunitrazepam (a sedative-hypnotic drug) and clonazepam (an anticonvulsant drug) or lorazepam (an anxiolytic drug). These data indicate that the ratios of IC50 values with and without bicuculline might provide the basis for an in vitro, pharmacologically relevant, classification of drugs acting on the benzodiazepine receptor. This procedure does not require extensive washing of the membrane preparation, in contrast to the method in which the ratios of IC50 values were determined with and without addition of GABA.", 
    "22": "The hypothesis linking decreased serotonin transmission to reduced anxiety as the mechanism in the anxiolytic activity of benzodiazepines conflicts with most clinical observations. Serotonin antagonists show no marked capacity to alleviate anxiety. On the other hand, clinical signs of reduced serotonergic transmission (low 5-HIAA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid) are frequently associated with aggressiveness, suicide attempts and increased anxiety. This brief review attempts to reconcile these human and animal findings by investigating whether anxiety reduction or increased impulsivity are likely to account for animal behavioral changes associated with decreased serotonergic transmission. The effects of manipulating central serotonin on experimental anxiety paradigms in animals (punishment, novelty) are reviewed and compared to the effects of anti-anxiety drugs. Anxiety seems neither necessary nor sufficient to induce control by serotonergic neurons on behavior. Further evidence suggests that behavioral effects of anxiolytics thought to be mediated by decreases in anxiety are not caused by the ability of these drugs to reduce serotonin transmission. Blockade of serotonin transmission, especially at the level of the substantia nigra, results in a shift of behavior towards facilitation of responding. This behavioral shift is particularly marked when there is competition between acting and restraining response tendencies and when obstacles prevent the immediate attainment of an anticipated reward. It is proposed that serotonergic neurons are not only involved in behavioral arousal but also in enabling the organism to arrange or tolerate delay before acting. Decreases in serotonin transmission seem to be associated with the increased performance of behaviors which are usually suppressed though not necessarily because of the alleviation of anxiety which might contribute to the suppression.", 
    "23": "It is well known that muscarinic cholinergic blockade either reduces or abolishes stimulated GH release in normal subjects. In this study we have investigated whether cholinergic muscarinic blockade could reduce the GH responses to GRF 1-29 and TRH in acromegalic subjects. Eight acromegalic subjects underwent two GRF tests (GRF 1-29, 1 microgram/kg i.v.) with and without pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg, i.v.). A further four of these patients received TRH (200 micrograms/kg, i.v.) on separate occasions with and without pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg, i.v.). Cholinergic muscarinic blockade did not alter the GH responses to GRF and TRH in patients with acromegaly. These findings are in contrast with previous data reported on the effects of cholinergic blockade on stimulated GH levels in normal subjects and in patients with type I diabetes mellitus and are compatible with the view that somatotroph adenomas are functionally disconnected from hypothalamic control mechanisms.", 
    "24": "Benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam reversed the antinociceptive action of caerulein in mice. Benzodiazepines (1-5 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally and 100 ng of caerulein was injected intracisternally to mice. Benzodiazepines did not change the basal pain threshold of mice but significantly antagonized the antinociceptive effect of caerulein. Proglumide (200 mg/kg, i.p.), which has been claimed to be a specific cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, could also antagonize the antinociceptive effects of caerulein. Naloxone (5 mg/kg) partially but significantly antagonized the antinociceptive effect of caerulein, suggesting that one of the mechanisms of antinociceptive action of caerulein is related to endogenous opioid peptides since benzodiazepines do not act on opioid receptors. Benzodiazepines may decrease the antinociceptive effect of caerulein through acting on cholecystokinin receptors in the central nervous system.", 
    "25": "This review comprises an exhaustive analysis of 120 case reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) representing the majority of published clinical data on this syndrome. Epidemiological, clinical and biological parameters, as well as those concerning the agent and the treatment of the syndrome, are critically evaluated on the basis of this data. The rate of neuroleptic loading is shown to play a cardinal role in the development of NMS. Rechallenge and aftercare of patients who need anti-psychotic treatment after NMS are considered.", 
    "26": "Peak velocity (PSV) and duration (SD) of horizontal saccadic eye movements are demonstrably under the control of specific brain stem structures. Experimental and clinical evidence suggest the existence of an immediate premotor system for saccade generation located in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). Effects on saccadic eye movements have been studied in normal volunteers with barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamine and ethanol. On two occasions computer analysis of PSV, SD, saccade reaction time (SRT) and saccade accuracy (SA) was carried out in comparison with more traditional methods of assessment of human psychomotor performance like choice reaction time (CRT) and critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT). The computer system proved to be a highly sensitive and objective method for measuring drug effect on central nervous system (CNS) function. It allows almost continuous sampling of data and appears to be particularly suitable for studying rapidly changing drug effects on the CNS.", 
    "27": "The interaction between benzodiazepines and the glucuronidation of morphine was studied in vitro and in vivo. All benzodiazepines tested (diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam and flunitrazepam) inhibited the glucuronidation of morphine in vitro in rat liver microsomes. Clonazepam was the most and nitrazepam the least powerful inhibitor, reducing the rate of morphine conjugation by 86% and 42% of the control, respectively, at a substrate and inhibitor concentration of 1.5 mM. Rats given a single oral dose of oxazepam (20 mg per kg body weight) one hour prior to an intraperitoneal dose of morphine (10 mg per kg body weight) had a lower morphine glucuronide/morphine concentration ratio in the 24 hour urine portion than control rats without pretreatment with oxazepam. These data indicate that oxazepam inhibits the glucuronidation of morphine in rats in vivo as well as in vitro.", 
    "28": "Pharmacological activities (hypnotic activity, anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures and motor incoordination) of N-allyl substituted derivatives of barbital (B) were investigated using mice. N-Monoallylbarbital (MAB) was found to possess more potent hypnotic activity [HD50 = 146(140-152)mg/kg, i.p.] and anticonvulsant activity [PTZ-ED50 = 25.1(18.1-34.8)mg/kg, i.p.] than the parent compound, barbital [HD50 = 179(153-209)mg/kg, i.p. and PTZ-ED50 = 27.7(25.5-30.1)mg/kg, i.p.]. N,N'-Diallylbarbital (DAB) was devoid of not only the hypnotic activity, but also of anticonvulsant activity and motor incoordination. The interactions of these N-allyl derivatives with various sedative-hypnotics [B, phenobarbital (PheB), amobarbital (AB), pentobarbital (PB), thiopental (TP) or diazepam (DZ)] were studied to characterize the antagonist or agonist properties of these N-allyl compounds. MAB (50-200 mg/kg, i.p.) showed a dose-dependent potentiation of B (200 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced sleep. DAB (150-300 mg/kg, i.p.) prolonged B-induced sleeping time, but its dose-response relationship was not clearly observed. Both compounds (150 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly prolonged PheB-, AB-, PB- and TP-induced sleeping time. Further, DAB (40 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced DZ-induced motor incoordination. These results indicate that MAB and DAB potentiate sedative-hypnotics responses in different manner, and that the mechanism of action may be due to their different effect, each other, on the central nervous system (CNS).", 
    "29": "The ability of a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, to modify the self-administration of anxiolytics was determined in rhesus monkeys. Lever-press responding was maintained in four monkeys under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of drug delivery in daily sessions of 2 hr duration. Responding was maintained either by flurazepam, lorazepam or pentobarbital. When responding was stable for each of these drugs, a range of doses of a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (0.0001-10 mg/kg, IM), was given 5 min prior to a session. At some doses the antagonist increased responding for lorazepam and flurazepam whereas pentobarbital self-administration was largely unaffected or reduced. These results suggest that Ro 15-1788 was able to specifically modify the effects of benzodiazepines responsible for drug-maintained performance.", 
    "30": "Differences in the tissue properties of water are the basis for the detailed anatomic visualization of internal body structures produced by NMR imaging. Physiological and pathological events have the potential to alter proton nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation properties through changes in water environment. In this study, the parenteral injection of pharmaceuticals produced significant changes (12-21%) in proton NMR relaxation times in tissues of treated rats. The extent of relaxation time change was both tissue specific and drug specific. Therefore, the effects of common pharmaceuticals should be considered in the interpretation of T1- and T2-weighted NMR images.", 
    "31": "The solubility of diazepam and prazepam in aqueous polyoxyethylen-10-dodecanol, polyoxyethylen-23-dodecanol and polyoxyethylen-20-hexadecanol, has been determined at 25.0 degrees C. Diazepam seems to achieve a higher micellar penetration than prazepam, in spite of an expected smaller hydrophobic character. Thermodynamic interpretation of the micellar solutions is carried out using the regular solutions approach. A surfactant-independent relation between solubilities of both drugs has been derived.", 
    "32": "A fatality following ingestion of the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (Anafranil), alprazolam (Xanax), and ethyl alcohol is described. Clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine were quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography and alprazolam by gas liquid chromatography. Concentrations of clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine were: in blood--0.84 and 1.4 mg/L; in urine--0.56 and 0.62 mg/L. Alprazolam concentration in blood was 0.069 mg/L. Ethyl alcohol was measured by headspace gas chromatography and found to be 375, 385, and 435 mg/dL in blood, urine, and vitreous humor, respectively. These findings are compared to previous reports of clomipramine related fatalities and alprazolam toxicity combined with ethyl alcohol.", 
    "33": "Patients with a postpanic anxiety disorder (PPAD) have panic attacks less frequently than patients with a panic disorder. A PPAD must be suspected when a physician notes the following: persistent somatic complaints despite repeatedly normal results of physical examinations and laboratory tests, reluctance to engage in certain activities or avoidance of activities because the patient fears the precipitation of panic or aggravation of symptoms, and history of one or more panic attacks. Three different groups of medication are effective in the treatment of PPAD: alprazolam (a triazolobenzodiazepine), imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant), and phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor). Relaxation training, desensitization, and family conferences assist in lowering anxiety and in improving the prognosis. An early diagnosis of PPAD reduces the patient's discomfort and morbidity and lowers the cost of medical care.", 
    "34": "Famotidine is currently under investigation as an H2-receptor antagonist. Eleven healthy male volunteers received a single 10 mg intravenous dose of diazepam on three occasions: once during coadministration of famotidine 40 mg bid, once during coadministration of cimetidine 300 mg qid, and once without other drug treatment (control). Multiple blood samples were drawn during the seven days after each diazepam dose. Diazepam and desmethyldiazepam plasma concentrations were measured by electron capture gas chromatography. There were no significant differences among the three treatment conditions in diazepam central compartment volume or total volume of distribution. During the cimetidine as compared with the control treatment, diazepam elimination half-life was significantly increased (72 vs 55 hr, P less than .05), total area under the curve (AUC) increased (11.8 vs 9.8 hr-micrograms/mL, P less than .05), and total clearance reduced (0.20 vs 0.28 mL/min/kg, P less than .05). Seven-day AUC for desmethyldiazepam also increased (4.6 vs 3.8 hr-micrograms/mL, P less than .05). However, there were no significant differences between famotidine and control treatment conditions in diazepam elimination half-life (53 vs 55 hr), total AUC (9.5 vs 9.8 hr-micrograms/mL), or total clearance (0.28 vs 0.28 mL/min/kg) or in seven-day AUC for desmethyldiazepam (3.9 vs 3.8 hr-micrograms/mL). Thus, therapeutic doses of cimetidine significantly impair the clearance of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam. Therapeutic doses of famotidine do not impair diazepam and desmethyldiazepam kinetics, suggesting that there is no significant kinetic interaction when diazepam and famotidine are administered concurrently in clinical practice.", 
    "35": "The anxiolytic triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam was administered to six male patients, aged 26 to 46 years, with panic disorder or agoraphobia (with panic attacks) to assess clinical effects and steady-state pharmacokinetics following multiple dosing at three levels: 3.0 mg/d, 6.0 mg/d, and 9.0 mg/d. Multiple-dose kinetics of alprazolam were compared with alprazolam disposition after a 1.0-mg oral dose in the same patients. Kinetic variables after the single dose were very similar to those reported previously for healthy young male volunteers. Mean values were peak plasma concentration, 19 ng/mL; time of peak, 1.33 hours after dosage; elimination half-life, 10.0 hours; total oral clearance, 1.11 mL/min/kg. During multiple dosage, mean steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) was proportional to dosing rate, and steady-state clearance was independent of dosage. Clinical improvement was rapid, with the greatest decrement in symptoms at the 3-mg/d dosage, at a mean Css of 30 ng/mL. Further improvement was not seen at 6 mg/d (Css, 62 ng/mL), or at 9 mg/d (Css, 103 ng/mL). Side effects, however, were directly related to dosage and plasma level, and increased progressively in number at the 3-, 6-, and 9-mg/d dosage levels. Thus, the disposition of alprazolam in young male patients with panic disorder is essentially identical to that in healthy male volunteers of similar age. Alprazolam clearance is independent of dose and plasma concentration up to daily doses of at least 9 mg/d, with steady-state plasma level proportional to dosing rate.",

    "37": "Substance abuse is a significant health problem in the adolescent population. Prevention is a formidable challenge, but attempts at discouraging experimentation in early adolescence and the promotion of healthy adult role models may be effective strategies. Questions that may elicit a history suggestive of abuse should be a routine part of the adolescent medical history. Pediatricians should be familiar with the important clinical findings resulting from intoxication with the various substances of abuse and should be able to recognize the \"telltale\" signs of abuse. Effective management is based on attention to the basics of life support, careful attention to the physical findings, and judicious use of specific therapeutic agents. Above all, a compassionate attitude should prevail if acute-phase recovery and long-term rehabilitation are to be successful.", 
    "38": "A review of the literature on the use of psychotropic drugs in dermatologic practice--including the antipsychotic, antidepressant, antianxiety, and hypnotic medications, as well as their pharmacologic properties, guidelines for clinical use, and a profile of adverse effects--is presented. After adverse effects and current guidelines for use are taken into consideration, it is suggested that psychotropic drugs be restricted to dermatologic conditions with clearly discernible psychiatric symptoms, for example, psoriasis and major depression, vitiligo resulting in social anxiety, and delusions of parasitosis. The pharmacologic properties of psychotropic drugs, such as the analgesic properties of certain antidepressants, may be of benefit in the treatment of dermatologic symptoms such as intractable pruritus, since pain and pruritus share the same central nervous system pathways. This use of psychotropic drugs remains to be evaluated by well-designed clinical trials.", 
    "39": "In a randomized double-blind, parallel groups study, 39 patients undergoing surgical removal of impacted third molar teeth received either temazepam 40 mg by mouth (as soft gelatin capsules) followed at 35 min by i.v. saline, or oral placebo followed at 35 min by i.v. diazepam 10 mg (Diazemuls). Rapid onset of significant anxiolytic activity and psychomotor depression was seen following temazepam, while the pattern and duration of postoperative sedation measured with standard psychometric tests, were similar for both treatments. Ratings by the surgeon and by the patients indicated that sedation following the two treatments was comparable. No significant cardiovascular complications were found with either treatment. The findings indicate that rapidly acting oral benzodiazepines such as temazepam provide safe, effective alternatives to i.v. diazepam for sedation in outpatients undergoing minor surgical procedures.", 
    "40": "Lactate infusions are anxiogenic in patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks, but few neuroendocrine profiles of this effect have appeared. The authors measured the number and intensity of panic symptoms and blood hormone levels during double-blind lactate infusions in 25 patients and 10 normal subjects and during placebo infusions in another five patients. Each patient was rechallenged with an identical infusate after chronic double-blind outpatient treatment with alprazolam or placebo. The results confirm the effectiveness of lactate infusions in evoking anxiety, extend previous hormone profiles of this maneuver, and indicate that chronic alprazolam treatment minimizes the neuroendocrine response to lactate challenges in patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks.",

    "42": "By use of the Addiction Research Center Inventory, the Amphetamine Self-Rating Scale, the Single-Dose Questionnaire, and selected physiologic measures (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, oral temperature, and pupil diameter), the abuse liability of buspirone (10, 20, and 40 mg) was compared with that of diazepam (10 and 20 mg) and placebo in 19 subjects who were hospitalized for the treatment of alcohol dependency. Each treatment was given as a single dose at intervals of at least three days according to a double-blind, six-period, crossover Latin square design. Neither buspirone nor diazepam had any effect on blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, or body temperature. A small, transient pupillary constriction was evident in the 20- and 40-mg buspirone groups, but it dissipated within two hours after dosing. Both buspirone and diazepam had only a small stimulating effect on appetite. On the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group and Sedation subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory, the 40-mg dose of buspirone yielded effects suggestive of a mild sedative-type drug. Only the 20-mg dose produced a significant effect on the Euphoria scale. Diazepam appeared to be more active as a sedative-hypnotic type of drug, by virtue of its effects on both the Amphetamine and Euphoria subscales and its greater effects on the Morphine-Benzedrine Group, Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group, and Sedation subscales, suggesting euphoria. Not only does the lack of effect of buspirone on the Amphetamine and Morphine-Benzedrine Group subscales indicate lack of a euphorigenic property, but the score on the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide subscale, especially in the 40-mg group, suggests a dysphorigenic property at high doses. On the Amphetamine Self-Rating Scale, buspirone and diazepam affected only the sleep factor and only the 40-mg buspirone dose was distinguishable from placebo. On the Single-Dose Questionnaire, both buspirone and diazepam tended to be rated more as sedative-type drugs, but buspirone was generally less well liked than diazepam. Overall, the results, which suggest a lack of euphoria and the presence of dysphoria at high doses, indicate that buspirone has only limited, if any, abuse liability.", 
    "43": "The effects of buspirone, diazepam, and placebo on tracking control were investigated over a nine-day period, using three groups of subjects, each with eight females and eight males. Subjects were tested using an interactive, computer-based driving simulator on days one, eight, and nine of the treatment period. On day nine, subjects received alcohol with their drug treatment. Measures of steering control were derived from car-driver transfer functions. Tracking performance was also measured. Diazepam was found to adversely affect steering control measures in comparison with placebo. This was true both after doses on the first as well as the eighth day of treatment. Thus, there was no evidence of behavioral tolerance to diazepam. In contrast, buspirone was not found to have any adverse effects on steering control; in fact, some evidence of improved tracking control was found. When alcohol was added to each treatment on the ninth day, differences between the drug treatment groups were less pronounced but in the same direction as on the first and eighth days.", 
    "44": "In 984 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who received buspirone in double-blind studies, the incidence of drowsiness (9 percent) did not differ significantly from that (10 percent) reported in 334 patients who received placebo. A probability value of p less than or equal to 0.10 was the criterion for significance. The incidence of drowsiness in buspirone-treated patients was significantly less than that in each of the groups receiving diazepam (32 percent), clorazepate (26 percent), lorazepam (58 percent), or alprazolam (43 percent). The side effects that did occur significantly more frequently in the buspirone group than in the placebo group were dizziness (9 percent versus 2 percent), headache (7 percent versus 2 percent), nervousness (4 percent versus 1 percent), light-headedness (4 percent versus less than 1 percent), diarrhea (3 percent versus less than 1 percent), paresthesia (2 percent versus less than 1 percent), excitation (2 percent versus less than 1 percent), and sweating/clamminess (1 percent versus 0 percent). The severities of these effects were predominantly rated as only mild or moderate. Fatigue occurred less frequently in buspirone-treated patients than in those receiving any of the benzodiazepines, and weakness occurred more frequently in diazepam-treated patients. Depression occurred less frequently in buspirone-treated patients than in those receiving clorazepate, diazepam, or lorazepam. Impotence occurred only in clorazepate- and lorazepam-treated patients. Decreased libido occurred more frequently in diazepam-treated patients, whereas increased libido was more frequent in clorazepate-treated patients. Nausea was reported more frequently in buspirone-treated patients than in those receiving clorazepate, diazepam, or alprazolam; diarrhea occurred more frequently in the buspirone group than in the diazepam group. The mean daily doses of the various treatments were buspirone, 20 mg; diazepam, 20 mg; clorazepate, 24 mg; lorazepam, 3 mg; and alprazolam, 1.5 mg. In an open-field study in West Germany involving 5,414 patients, gastrointestinal-related complaints were the most frequently reported side effects.", 
    "45": "Buspirone, a new nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, was compared with clorazepate in a double-blind, multicenter trial conducted with 336 outpatients who had moderate to severe anxiety. The two treatments were equally effective for relief of symptoms, including anxiety with associated depression. Although both agents were generally well tolerated, the profile of side effects was dissimilar. Drowsiness and depression occurred significantly (p less than 0.055) more frequently with clorazepate, whereas nausea and headache occurred significantly (p less than 0.055) more frequently with buspirone. Clorazepate-treated patients were significantly (p less than 0.055) more likely to have had an adverse experience that was considered drug related or that interfered with the therapeutic effect. In this study, buspirone was shown to be an effective antianxiety agent, causing significantly less sedation than clorazepate.", 
    "46": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent unrelated to the benzodiazepines in structure or pharmacologic properties. Extensive clinical studies have shown buspirone to be effective in the treatment of anxiety, with efficacy comparable to diazepam or clorazepate. Buspirone exhibits a unique pharmacologic profile in that it alleviates anxiety without causing sedation or functional impairment and does not promote abuse or physical dependence. Furthermore, preclinical studies have shown that buspirone does not possess anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties and does not interact significantly with central nervous system depressants. Biochemical and electrophysiologic studies indicate that buspirone alters monoaminergic and GABAergic systems in a manner different from that of the benzodiazepines. The uniform depressant action of the benzodiazepines upon serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic cell firing may result from their facilitatory effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid and its known inhibitory influence in these monoaminergic areas. Unlike the benzodiazepines, buspirone exerts a differential influence upon monoaminergic neuronal activity, suppressing serotonergic activity while enhancing dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell firing. The mechanism of action of buspirone challenges the notion that only one neurotransmitter mediates anxiety. The interaction with multiple neurotransmitters at multiple brain sites suggests that buspirone may alter diverse activities within a \"neural matrix of anxiety.\" In contrast to the benzodiazepines, buspirone orchestrates activity within this neural matrix to achieve effective treatment of anxiety while preserving arousal and attentional processes.", 
    "47": "In an attempt to elucidate a possible role of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in adrenal glomerulosa cell, effect of diazepam on potassium-induced aldosterone secretion was studied using isolated bovine adrenal glomerulosa cell. Diazepam inhibited aldosterone secretion stimulated by 8mM potassium in a dose dependent manner. The ID50 was approximately 14 nM. Although diazepam inhibited potassium action effectively, forskolin-induced aldosterone secretion was not affected by diazepam. These results indicate that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor may have an active role in regulating aldosterone secretion. The voltage dependent calcium channel may be a possible site of benzodiazepine action in this tissue.", 
    "48": "The high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) retention characteristics of 21 benzodiazepine drugs and some of their metabolites have been examined on both silica and ODS-silica packing materials. Four HPLC systems have been considered and retention data are presented for the drugs on these systems. The correlation of retention data on the systems is considered with reference to the problem of identifying unknown benzodiazepines.", 
    "49": "Anthramycin, tomaymycin, and sibiromycin are members of the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine [P(1,4)B] antitumor antibiotic group. These drugs bind covalently through N2 of guanine and lie within the minor groove of DNA [Petrusek, R. L., Anderson, G. L., Garner, T. F., Fannin, Q. L., Kaplan, D. J., Zimmer, S. G., & Hurley, L. H. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1111-1119]. The DNA sequence specificity of the P(1,4)B antibiotics has been determined by a footprinting method using methidiumpropyl-EDTA-iron(II) [MPE.Fe(II)], and the results show that each of the drugs has a two to three base pair sequence specificity that includes the covalently modified guanine residue. While 5'PuGPu is the most preferred binding sequence for the P(1,4)Bs, 5'PyGPy is the least preferred sequence. Footprinting analysis by MPE.Fe(II) reveals a minimum of a three to four base pair footprint size for each of the drugs on DNA with a larger than expected offset (two to three base pairs) on opposite strands to that observed in previous analyses of noncovalently bound small molecules. There is an extremely large enhancement of MPE.Fe(II) cleavage between drug binding sites in AT rich regions, probably indicating a drug-induced change in the conformational features of DNA which encourages interaction with MPE.Fe(II). In the presence of sibiromycin or tomaymycin the normally guanine-specific methylene blue reaction used in Maxam and Gilbert sequencing cleaves at other bases in defined positions relative to the drug binding sites. Finally, modeling studies are used to rationalize the differences and similarities in sequence specificities between the various drugs in the P(1,4)B group and their reactions with DNA.", 
    "50": "The densities of dihydropyridine calcium antagonist binding sites were examined in brains and cardiac issues of representative species from 4 classes of non-mammalian vertebrates (aves, pigeon; amphibia, frog; reptilia, chameleon; and osteichthyes, trout) previously shown to have low or undetectable levels of 'peripheral-type' binding sites for benzodiazepines. Dihydropyridine binding sites were present in brain and cardiac tissue of these 4 classes of non-mammalian vertebrates. The apparent dissociation constants for [3H]nitrendipine in non-mammalian vertebrates were comparable to those found in mammalian (rat) tissues. The densities of [3H]nitrendipine binding sites in brain and cardiac tissues were highest in the pigeon, with lower densities in tissues from chameleon, frog and trout. The densities of dihydropyridine binding sites in the latter tissues were comparable to those observed in the rat. Thus, dihydropyridine binding sites are phylogenetically diverse yet have similar kinetic characteristics in mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. Despite the pharmacologic evidence that links dihydropyridine binding sites and peripheral binding sites for benzodiazepines in mammals, the earlier evolutionary appearance of the former sites suggest that even though they may share one or more common effector mechanisms, they are discrete entities.", 
    "51": "A number of centrally active drugs were tested for antagonism of physostigmine- or apomorphine-induced yawning and for apomorphine-induced penile erections. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists piperoxan and idazoxan inhibited the yawning response without affecting the penile erections. The 5HT agonist quipazine and the histamine antagonist dexchlorpheniramine inhibited the yawning response more effectively than the penile erections. Dexchlorpheniramine even enhanced the apomorphine-induced penile erections and induced penile erections in physostigmine-treated rats. The 5HT antagonists metergoline and methysergide blocked the apomorphine-induced penile erections without affecting the yawning response. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, the dopamine antagonist sulpiride, the antihistaminic mepyramine and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide inhibited both yawning and penile erections at the same dose level. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and phenoxybenzamine were inactive. It is concluded that yawning and penile erections can be differentially affected by drug treatments. Also, while concomitant yawning and penile erections can be selectively induced by a class of dopamine receptor agonists, the same selectivity does not apply to antagonism of these induced behaviours.", 
    "52": "The median inhibitory and anticonvulsant potencies of seven benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonists and one BDZ antagonist (Ro15-1788) were established by two tests: inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam receptor binding and prevention of caffeine-induced seizures in mice. The effect of Ro15-1788 on the anticonvulsant potency of diazepam against caffeine-induced seizures was also investigated. The [3H]flunitrazepam receptor binding inhibitory potencies (IC50s) of the BDZ agonists correlate well with their anticonvulsant potencies (ED50s) against caffeine-induced seizures (r = 0.831; P greater than 0.01 and less than 0.05). Ro15-1788 and clonazepam are the most potent inhibitors (IC50s: 1.72 and 1.75 nM, respectively), but differ markedly in their ability to obtund caffeine-induced seizures (ED50s: 43.2 and 0.226 mg/kg, respectively). Although both Ro15-1788 and diazepam are effective against caffeine-induced seizures, when used in combination Ro15-1788 antagonizes the anti-caffeine effect of diazepam. These data indicate that Ro15-1788 is a BDZ partial agonist with low efficacy as well as a potent antagonist.", 
    "53": "Rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate injections of saline from those of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE), a compound that binds to the benzodiazepine receptor, but often has actions opposite to those of the benzodiazepines. A benzodiazepine agonist midazolam and low doses of a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, reversed the discriminative effects of beta-CCE. Higher doses of Ro 15-1788 produced stimulus effects similar to beta-CCE. In a separate experiment, monkeys responded to terminate intravenous infusions of beta-CCE, but not midazolam. This aversive effect of beta-CCE was reversed by Ro 15-1788. The behavioral effects of beta-CCE in these non-human primates are consistent with other data that have shown it to act on benzodiazepine receptors, and support the hypothesis that beta-CCE can be considered an inverse agonist at this receptor.", 
    "54": "The neutral to base transition in human serum albumin has been studied by means of circular dichroism and equilibrium dialysis using nitrazepam as the non-covalently bound circular dichroic probe. Spectroscopically two transitions were observed over the pH range 5.5-8.5, whereas dialysis data point to only one transition occurring in the latter part of the pH region studied. Both pH dependences could only be correlated if it is assumed that the neutral to base transition consists of at least two distinct consecutive steps.", 
    "55": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of pirenzepine in human plasma is reported using imipramine as an internal standard. The assay has a lower limit of detection of 2.5 ng/ml. The calibration function is found to be linear in the range from 5 ng/ml up to at least 100 ng/ml. Two sets of chromatographic conditions are described, which provide different chromatographic selectivities for the separation of the compounds of interest from other material present in a sample.", 
    "56": "After 21 days of twice daily i.p. injections of bupropion (10 mg/kg), B.W.306U (10 mg/kg) or saline, 5 rat brain regions were removed for [3H]flunitrazepam binding assay. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed no change in the Bmax in any brain regions in drug-treated rats compared to controls. There was, however, a significant change in the Kd value in the limbic forebrain of B.W.306U-treated rats.", 
    "57": "Antibiotics exhibiting immunomodulatory activities were found among antitumor antibiotics. These antibiotics had antileukemic activity. Neothramycin and mazethramycin, which are classified as anthramycin-group antibiotics, activated macrophages so that they became antitumor effector cells. Aclacinomycin and oxanosine inhibited generation of suppressor cells in tumor-bearing mice and oxanosine enhanced antitumor effector cells. Therapy using spergualin produced specific antitumor immunity in cured mice. The immunomodulatory activities of auromomycin and bactobolin were also reported.", 
    "58": "The rate and extent of the absorption of triazolam following sublingual and oral administration were evaluated in this study. Eight healthy volunteers received triazolam 0.5 mg in a commercially available tablet, by sublingual and oral routes on two occasions in random sequence. Plasma triazolam concentrations during 24 hours after each dose were measured by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. The mean total area under the curve for sublingual administration was significantly larger than that following oral dosage (28.9 vs 22.6 ng-hr/mL, P less than .025). The peak plasma concentration after sublingual dosage was also higher than after oral administration (4.7 vs 3.9 ng/mL, P less than .1). No significant differences between sublingual and oral administration were found for the elimination half-life of triazolam (4.1 vs 3.7 hr) and the time of peak concentration (1.22 vs 1.25 hr) after dose. Thus, the bioavailability of triazolam after sublingual administration is increased by an average of 28% compared with oral administration of the same dose, possibly because first-pass extraction is bypassed. Clinical effects of triazolam may likewise be enhanced by sublingual dosage.", 
    "59": "Circulating basal prolactin (PRL) levels were evaluated in 126 subjects of both sexes with partial or generalized epilepsy, who were treated with phenobarbital (PB) alone or in combination with either phenytoin or benzodiazepines. A significant increase in PRL levels was observed in male, but not in female, patients compared with a sex- and age-matched healthy volunteer group. Circadian PRL secretion, studied in six male epileptic patients on PB monotherapy and in nine normal subjects, showed comparable 24-h PRL mean values and a preserved PRL surge during the night in both groups; however, a statistically significant additional peak was found in male epileptic subjects during the late afternoon. The cosinor analysis of the data, used to evaluate PRL rhythmicity, showed a disruption of the 24-h periodicity in epileptic subjects, while the 12-h periodicity was maintained. These results indicate that central and/or peripheral mechanisms involved in PRL secretion control are more sensitive to PB alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in male than in female subjects. However, the changes of PRL secretion we found were small and unrelated to the different clinical conditions.", 
    "60": "The experiments have shown the capacity of antidepressant amitriptylin (0.5 mg/kg, i. p.) and tranquilizer phenazepam (0.1 mg/kg i. p.) to normalize the adaptive behaviour and almost completely prevent the development of alcohol motivation in animals with insufficient adaptive behaviour. It was established that in animals initially rejecting alcohol, chronic treatment with these drugs as well as d-amphetamine promoted alcohol motivation. The results obtained have proved our earlier hypothesis that preclinical search for drugs for the prevention and treatment of early stages of alcoholism is possible only in animals pre-selected according to their inclination to experimental alcoholism.", 
    "61": "Subcutaneous administration of pilocarpine to rats that were pretreated with a small dose of lithium chloride results in the evolution of generalized convulsive status epilepticus. The production of status epilepticus is absolutely reproducible, has a very consistent time to onset (22 min), has a duration of several hours, and is extremely severe with a high mortality rate. Experimental results show that this animal model of status epilepticus: (i) requires activation of muscarinic receptors because the initiation of seizures is blocked by atropine; (ii) requires presynaptic cholinergic activity because it is attenuated by hemicholinium-3; (iii) recruits noncholinergic cells because when status epilepticus is established it is not altered by atropine administration; and (iv) is blocked by pretreatment with diazepam and ongoing seizures are terminated by administration of diazepam, similar to certain forms of status epilepticus in humans. The reproducibility, prolonged nature, and involvement of a clearly defined neurochemical system as the triggering mechanism, i.e., cholinergic activation, makes this a potentially valuable animal model of generalized convulsive status epilepticus.", 
    "62": "Conversion to sinus rhythm is a rare event in a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation. There are no reports in the literature of this happening during general anaesthesia. This case report presents such a case and discusses the possible aetiology.", 
    "63": "Intrathecal and intracarotid effects of ketamine were investigated in anaesthetized rats. Ketamine was administered in the subarachnoid space in doses ranging from 300 to 1500 micrograms X kg-1. In these doses ketamine produced a short-lasting hypotension and bradycardia which may be due to inhibition of sympathetic outflow from thoraco-lumbar region. On the other hand when ketamine (5 mg X kg-1) was injected into the cerebral circulation it produced a rise in blood pressure and heart rate, probably through a cholinergic mechanism.", 
    "64": "We have reported previously that chick myocardium responds to muscarinic agonists with a decrease in slow inward current in both atrial and ventricular muscle. A second ionic current, the background potassium current, is increased in the atrium but not in the ventricle. A possible explanation for the modulation of potassium current in atrium only is the existence of a unique muscarinic receptor population in atrium responsible for potassium conductance changes. We looked for differences in atrial and ventricular muscarinic receptors by pharmacological and biochemical techniques. The dissociation constants for binding of l-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate were 46 pM in both tissues. Estimates for binding of atropine in competitive binding experiments gave dissociation constants of 1.8 nM in atrium and 2.0 nM in ventricle. Pharmacologic evaluation of atropine occupancy of muscarinic receptor by Schild analysis showed no difference in the dissociation constants in atrium (1.7 nM) and ventricle (1.1 nM). Displacement of 0.1 nM [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate with carbachol showed the atrium to have a higher apparent affinity for agonist than the ventricle (atrium IC50 = 8.2 X 10(-6) M, ventricle IC50 = 2.1 X 10(-5) M). Computerized curve fitting analysis detected three binding states (super high, high and low affinity) for carbachol in the atrium and ventricle in the absence and presence of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (10(-4) M). We did not detect a qualitative difference between atrial and ventricular muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic-induced potassium conductance changes which occur in the atria do not appear to be due to a unique muscarinic receptor in atria.", 
    "65": "The development of cholinergic synapses in the rat olfactory bulb was investigated by measuring changes in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; EC 2.3.1.6.), a presynaptic cholinergic marker, and in the concentration of muscarinic receptors, components of cholinoceptive membranes. Three biochemical properties of the muscarinic system also were examined for possible differentiation: ligand binding, molecular weight, and isoelectric point. Receptors from embryonic (day 18), neonatal (postnatal day 3), and adult rat olfactory bulbs exhibited identical complex binding (nH = 0.45) of the agonist carbachol. For each age, the relative proportions of high-affinity (Ki approximately equal to 1.0 microM) and low-affinity (Ki approximately equal to 100 microM) binding states were 60% and 40%, respectively. The antagonist pirenzepine also bound to high-affinity (Ki approximately equal to 0.15 microM, RH approximately equal to 70%) and low-affinity (Ki approximately equal to 2.0 microM, RL approximately equal to 30%) sites in neonatal and adult rats. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard-labeled receptors from neonatal and adult rats showed a single electrophoretic form with an apparent molecular weight of 65,000. In contrast, analytical isoelectric focusing indicated high pI (4.50) and low pI (4.00) receptor forms were present. Neonatal rats contained approximately equal proportions of the two receptor forms, whereas adult rats contained mainly the low pI form, indicating that molecular alteration of the receptor population had occurred during development. Comparison of postnatal changes in acetylcholine receptors and ChAT activity showed a striking correlation between the development of cholinergic terminals and muscarinic receptors. Throughout the first postnatal week, ChAT activity remained at 5% of adult levels; activity began to rise on postnatal day 6 and gradually reached adult levels (56 +/- 4 mumol of [3H]acetylcholine/h/g) during the fourth week. Similarly, muscarinic receptor concentration was low (30-50 fmol/mg) throughout the first week, began to rise at postnatal day 7; and reached 90% of adult levels (317 +/- 17 fmol/mg) by the fourth week. In contrast, there was little increase in the concentration of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (30 fmol/mg) during this period. The parallel postnatal development of ChAT activity and muscarinic receptors suggests the existence of factors that couple the differentiation of presynaptic cholinergic terminals and postsynaptic cholinoceptive elements.", 
    "66": "Pirenzepine has been proposed to selectively inhibit gastric acid production. In contrast to classical anticholinergics, pirenzepine does not appear to produce systemic side effects or to strongly inhibit contractions in gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle. This study compares the effects of two doses of pirenzepine (25 and 50 mg per os) with a standard anticholinergic, propantheline, 30 mg per os, and with placebo on esophageal contraction pressures in 12 healthy volunteers in a random double-blind study sequence. No significant change in lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) or in peristaltic pressures occurred with placebo or pirenzepine 25 or 50 mg. However, propantheline produced marked reduction in peristaltic contraction pressures and increased velocity (4 of 12 subjects had complete loss of peristalsis). LESP decrease was almost significant. Seven of 12 subjects experienced dry mouth after propantheline, but none after either dose of pirenzepine or placebo. This study indicates that, as opposed to a classical anticholinergic, pirenzepine does not adversely affect esophageal contraction pressures nor does it have anticholinergic side effects with the oral doses studied.", 
    "67": "The effects of diazepam (1-100 microM) on the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA of the mouse spleen lymphocytes in vitro have been investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte DNA synthesis has been found. A 70% inhibition occurred with 100 microM diazepam concentration.", 
    "68": "The effect of equal doses of brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno [3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin) (0.25 mg) and flurazepam (30 mg) was studied in double-blind technique in a continuous performance test. Experiments were done 7 h after the last of a three-day ingestion. The task was composed of a compensatory tracking one and additional visual ones in the central visual field (visuo-motor processing time) and in the peripheral visual field (visuo-motor reaction time). The effects were compared with that of different concentrations of alcohol. The starting point of all parameters was similar in spite of the drug used. The drug influenced the values during the running of the single experiment. Visuo-motor coordination in a compensatory tracking task, visuo-mental processing time, visuo-motor reaction time and reading errors were not impaired with brotizolam. In contrast there were observed residual effects with 30 mg flurazepam. As well visuo-motor coordination (p1 less than 0.01, p2 less than 0.01), visuo-mental processing time (p1 less than 0.025), p2 less than 0.05), visuo-motor reaction time (p1 less than 0.05, p2 less than 0.01) and reading errors (p1 less than 0.10, p2 less than 0.05) were impaired compared to placebo (p1) and 0.25 mg brotizolam (p2). Moreover, events in the peripheral visual field were not detected. Subjective assessments of performance correlated with measured performance only for flurazepam was performance in comparison with placebo assessed as significantly worse both for visuo-motor coordination (p less than 0.01) as well as visuo-mental processing time (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The interaction of brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno [3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin) and diazepam with ethanol, phenobarbital, haloperidol and desipramine was investigated in a motor performance test (rotarod) in mice. Brotizolam and diazepam were tested at dose levels which partially impaired the motor performance. In combination with ethanol and phenobarbital only the anticipated additive effect was observed. Brotizolam and diazepam partially overcame the cataleptic effect of haloperidol. A combined treatment with brotizolam and desipramine did not alter the effect obtained with brotizolam alone. In a second experiment the loss of righting reflexes induced by ethanol and hexobarbital was prolonged by brotizolam and diazepam depending on the dose. From this it is concluded that in combination with ethanol brotizolam and diazepam may be effective at antiemotional and anticonvulsant doses. In combination with hexobarbital brotizolam is expected to have a greater \"therapeutic range\".", 
    "70": "The degree of physical dependence induced by oral administration of brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno [3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin), triazolam, diazepam and nitrazepam in rhesus monkeys was evaluated in primary dependence studies. Substitution tests were performed in barbital-dependent animals. In the primary dependence studies, two dosages of each compound were administered for four weeks to compare the effects on motocoordination and development of body weight as well as the withdrawal symptoms after interruption of these chronic administrations. Taking into account the therapeutically effective doses in man, brotizolam and triazolam were tested at doses of 2 X 2 and 2 X 3 mg/kg/d. For comparison, 2 X 10 and 2 X 15 mg/kg/d of diazepam and nitrazepam were administered. Brotizolam and triazolam had a shorter duration of action than diazepam and nitrazepam. During chronic administration of brotizolam, triazolam and diazepam all animals gained body weight. Motocoordination was impaired by these compounds to a comparable degree. Nitrazepam, in contrast, was less compatible. It induced a decrease in body weight and a more pronounced disturbance of motocoordination. Only triazolam evoked effects indicating development of tolerance. Compared with the reference compounds, brotizolam induced the weakest degree of physical dependence. In the substitution tests about 2 mg/kg brotizolam, 0.6 mg/kg triazolam, 4.5 mg/kg diazepam and doses of less than 1 mg/kg nitrazepam were equipotent, suppressing withdrawal symptoms of barbital. These results demonstrate that relatively high doses of brotizolam were necessary to substitute barbital. The data obtained in rhesus monkeys are compared with the therapeutic doses in humans and discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Abstinence symptoms of doses acutely equi-effective on motocoordination of brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno [3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin) and diazepam in rhesus monkeys were evaluated in a primary dependence study of 61 days. After termination of oral treatment with 3 X 5.4 mg/kg/d brotizolam and 3 X 13.5 mg/kg/d diazepam the duration of withdrawal symptoms varied. Most symptoms of brotizolam abstinence disappeared within 24 h of withdrawal, while the withdrawal symptoms following diazepam were more pronounced between the second and fifth day after termination of administration. Regularly during the whole study, determinations of the serum levels of brotizolam and diazepam were performed. Two days after termination of brotizolam treatment the substance could scarcely be detected in the serum. Diazepam serum levels, in contrast, declined more slowly. The physical dependence capacity of lower daily doses of brotizolam, 3 X 0.2, 3 X 0.6, and 3 X 1.8 mg/kg/d was tested in experiments with chronic administration for 4 weeks. 3 X 1.8 mg/kg/d was the lowest oral dose inducing physical dependence. Taking into consideration the great difference in human therapeutic single dosages, brotizolam is thought to have a very low physical dependence capacity in man, compared with diazepam.", 
    "72": "Comparing dose levels for pentetrazol antagonism or antiaggressive activity with those causing motorial side effects in mice brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-alpha]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin) showed consistently larger dose ranges than diazepam. This gives evidence that brotizolam may offer the advantage of not causing motorial side effects during therapeutic use as do many other diazepines."
