    "3": "Fluctuations in sales of psychotropic drugs that cannot be explained by disease prevalence were caused by changes in sales of the benzodiazepines and SSRIs. We found a decline in the sales of benzodiazepines after a peak in 1986, likely due to the recognition that they cause dependence. From a low level in 1992, we found that the sales of SSRIs increased almost linearly by a factor of 18, up to 44 DDD per 1000 inhabitants, which was closely related to the number of products on the market that increased by a factor of 16.",

Ambulation and motor coordination were also tested to discern behavioral changes from general motor alterations. Without diazepam treatment, middle-aged males showed longer burying behavior latencies, more prod explorations and less freezing than both groups of females. Untreated middle aged males also showed less cumulative burying and more immobility compared to females with irregular cycles. None of the parameters showed any difference between the female groups. Diazepam (0.5 and 1.0mg/kg) increased burying behavior latency in females, but had no effect on any parameter in middle aged males. However, a higher dose (2.0mg/kg) of diazepam increased immobility, freezing and the number of prod shocks and decreased prod explorations and groomings, but impaired motor coordination in males. In contrast with young males and females, diazepam at any dose reduced cumulative burying. Data are discussed on the bases of (1) sex and age differences in burying behavior and on (2) the anxiolytic-like action of diazepam and its side effects.",

Using a rat model we investigated the effects of acute and long term olanzapine treatment on weight gain, food preference and glucose metabolism. Olanzapine treated rats fed a chow diet grew more slowly than vehicle controls but olanzapine treated animals fed a high fat/sugar diet grew faster than control animals on the same diet. These changes in weight were paralleled by changes in fat mass. Olanzapine also induced a strong preference for a high fat/high sugar diet. Acute exposure to olanzapine rapidly induced severe impairments of glucose tolerance and increased insulin secretion but did not impair insulin tolerance. These results indicate the defect in glucose metabolism induced by acute olanzapine treatment was most likely due to increased hepatic glucose output associated with a reduction in active GLP-1 levels and correspondingly high glucagon levels.",

    "35": "The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) published guidelines in 2003 which aimed to standardise and improve the safety of sedation in the modern Radiology department. As sedation requirements increase, we decided to audit our own departments understandings and practice with respect to sedation. A repeat audit cycle was performed following a re-educational lecture, one year later. Three common sedation case scenarios were incorporated into a questionnaire which detailed questioning on requirements for fasting, monitoring and the order and use of sedation drugs alongside analgesics. These were compared to the 2003 RCR guidelines. The audit was recycled at one year. Despite the RCR guidelines, freely available on the RCR website, there was a persisting variation in practice which revealed a lack of awareness of the requirements for adequate fasting and the importance of giving the opiate before the benzodiazepine (sedative) agent in cases where a combination are chosen. The audit did show a trend towards using shorter acting benzodiazepines, which is in keeping with the guidelines. Monitoring of vital signs was generally, well carried out. General awareness of the RCR guidelines for safe sedation in the Radiology department was initially low and practice found to be variable. Re-education saw some improvements but also, some persisting habitual deviations from the guidelines, particularly with respect to the order in which the opiate and sedative benzodiazepine were given.", 
    "36": "Centrally active agents have a variable impact in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) that is unexplained. How to phenotype the individual OSA response is clinically important, as it may help to identify who will be at risk of respiratory depression and who will benefit from a centrally active agent. Based on loop gain theory, we hypothesized that OSA patients with higher central chemosensitivity have higher breathing instability following the use of a hypnosedative, temazepam. In 20 men with OSA in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial we tested the polysomnographically (PSG) measured effects of temazepam 10 mg versus placebo on sleep apnoea. Treatment nights were at least 1 week apart. Ventilatory chemoreflexes were also measured during wakefulness in each subject. The patients (mean \u00b1 standard deviation; 44 \u00b1 12 years) had predominantly mild-to-moderate OSA [baseline apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) = 16.8 \u00b1 14.1]. Patients' baseline awake central chemosensitivity correlated significantly with both the change of SpO\u2082 nadir between temazepam and placebo (r = -0.468, P = 0.038) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI; r = 0.485, P = 0.03), but not with the change of AHI (r = 0.18, P = 0.44). Peripheral chemosensitivity and ventilatory recruitment threshold were not correlated with the change of SpO\u2082 nadir, ODI or AHI (all P > 0.05). Mild-moderate OSA patients with higher awake central chemosensitivity had greater respiratory impairment during sleep with temazepam. Relatively simple daytime tests of respiratory control may provide a method of determining the effect of sedative-hypnotic medication on breathing during sleep in OSA patients.", 
    "37": "Oral fluid (OF) has become a popular specimen to test for presence of drugs, particularly in regards to road safety. In Victoria, OF specimens from drivers have been used to test for the presence of methylamphetamine (MA) and \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) since 2003 and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) since 2006. LC-MS/MS has been used to test the most recent 853 submitted OF specimens from Victoria Police for 31 drugs of abuse including those listed in the Australian Standard AS4760-2006. At least one proscribed drug was detected in 96% of drivers, of which MA was the most common (77%), followed by THC (42%), MDMA (17%) and the combination of all three (3.9%). Opioids were detected in 14% of drivers of which 4.8% were positive for 6-acetylmorphine and 3.3% for methadone. The incidence of the opioids tramadol (1.2%) and oxycodone (1.1%) were relatively low. Cocaine (8.0%) was as commonly detected as benzodiazepines (8.0%), and was almost always found in combination with MA (7.9%). Samples positive to benzodiazepines were largely due to diazepam (3.5%) and alprazolam (3.4%), with only 0.2% of drivers combining the two. Ketamine was also detected in 1.5% of cases. While the incidences of the proscribed drugs itself are concerning, it is clear that many drivers are also using other drugs capable of causing impairment.", 
    "38": "The atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are associated with weight gain and an increased incidence of metabolic disease including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Epidemiological, cross-sectional and prospective studies suggest that two of the AAPs, olanzapine and clozapine, cause the most dramatic weight gain and metabolic impairments including increased fasting glucose, insulin and triglycerides. Relative to the other AAPs, both olanzapine and clozapine exhibit a particularly high antagonistic affinity for histamine and muscarinic receptors which have been hypothesized as mediators of the reported increase in weight and glucose abnormalities. In this article, we review the current evidence for the AAP associated weight gain and abnormal glucose metabolism. We postulate that the effects of the AAPs on food intake and peripheral metabolism are initially independently regulated but with increasing body adiposity, the early AAP-induced impairments in peripheral metabolism will be exacerbated, thereby establishing a vicious cycle such that the effects of the AAP are magnified by the known pathophysiological consequences of obesity. Furthermore, we examine how inhibition of the histaminergic pathway may mediate increases in food intake and the potential role of the vagus nerve in the reported peripheral metabolic effects.", 
    "39": "Postpartum female rats exhibit a suppression of anxiety-related behaviors when compared to diestrous virgin females, pregnant females, and males. This blunted anxiety promotes optimal maternal care and involves elevated GABA neurotransmission, possibly including greater density of GABA(A) and benzodiazepine receptors in the postpartum brain. We here examined autoradiographic binding of [(3)H]muscimol to measure the total population of GABA(A) receptors and [(3)H]flunitrazepam to assess density of benzodiazepine sites in the medial prefrontal cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray of female rats sacrificed on day 7 postpartum, day 10 of pregnancy, or as diestrous virgins. A group of sexually na\u00efve male rats was also included. We found that [(3)H]muscimol binding did not differ among groups in any site but that diestrous virgin females had greater [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in the CA1 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus compared to mid-pregnant females and males. Notably, postpartum and diestrous virgin females did not significantly differ in binding of either ligand in any site examined. This is the first study to evaluate the densities of GABA(A) and benzodiazepine binding sites simultaneously across three female reproductive states and sex with a focus on brain sites influencing anxiety-related behaviors. The results suggest that changes in other GABA(A) receptor characteristics such as subunit composition, or increased presynaptic GABA release during interactions with offspring, must instead play a greater role in the postpartum suppression of anxiety in laboratory rats.",

    "53": "Brivanib alaninate is the orally available prodrug of brivanib, a dual inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways that is under therapeutic investigation for various malignancies. Brivanib alaninate inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro, and thus there is potential for drug-drug interaction with CYP3A4 substrates, such as midazolam. The present study evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters and safety/tolerability upon coadministration of brivanib alaninate and midazolam. Healthy participants received intravenous (IV) or oral midazolam with and without oral brivanib alaninate. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 12 hours after midazolam and up to 48 hours after brivanib alaninate. Twenty-four participants were administered study drugs; 21 completed the trial. No clinically relevant effect of brivanib alaninate on the overall exposure to midazolam following IV or oral administration was observed. Orally administered brivanib alaninate was generally well tolerated in the presence of IV or oral midazolam. The lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction between brivanib and midazolam indicates that brivanib alaninate does not influence either intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4 and confirms that brivanib alaninate may be safely coadministered with midazolam and other CYP3A4 substrates.",

She had taken none of these drugs for 4 days prior to admission because she was unable to have the prescriptions refilled. Subsequently, the patient exhibited repeated arm and leg motions in response to an inner restlessness. Upon admission to the emergency department, she was agitated and restless; all vital signs and results of laboratory studies were within normal limits. Gabapentin was restarted at the original dosage and the symptoms resolved within 8 hours.

    "67": "Olanzapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, is a first-line agent in the treatment of schizophrenia. The objective of this review was to determine whether olanzapine warrants clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring in patients with schizophrenia, using a previously published decision-making algorithm. Although olanzapine is an appropriate therapy for patients with schizophrenia and is readily measurable in biological fluids, significant interindividual variation exists in its pharmacokinetics. While the duration of therapy is expected to be long term, the correlation of olanzapine concentrations with efficacy and toxicity has not been well defined in the literature. There are multiple tools readily available for the assessment of efficacy in schizophrenia, and clinical signs and symptoms can be used to monitor both for efficacy and for adverse effects. Therefore, routine monitoring of olanzapine concentrations does not appear warranted in the general schizophrenic population. However, patients in whom a change in olanzapine pharmacokinetics is expected--such as during addition or removal of an enzyme-inducing or -inhibiting drug, or during initiation or cessation of smoking--may benefit from clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring, as would patients in whom non-compliance is suspected. Patients who fail to respond to maximum recommended doses and those who experience adverse effects from therapeutic doses may also benefit from therapeutic drug monitoring, as they may have inherent variations in hepatic enzyme activity. However, in the population at large who suffer from schizophrenia, monitoring of olanzapine concentrations is not expected to offer additional benefit beyond appropriate clinical monitoring alone.",

    "69": "At least 50% of patients with depression do not enter remission after several weeks of antidepressant therapy. To determine the treatment options and their respective risk-benefit balances in this setting, we reviewed the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology. Clinical trials and epidemiological studies show that depression should only be considered drug-resistant after at least 6 weeks of therapy. After assessing residual symptoms and their impact on the patient's quality of life, a search should be made for factors responsible for the persistence of depression, such as the patient's environment, a psychiatric or somatic disorder, and drug intake or addiction. Increasing the dose of the first-line antidepressant is only based on weak evidence. Trials comparing continuing the first-line antidepressant versus switching to another pharmacological class have yielded conflicting results. A switch may benefit some patients, but the elimination half-life of the discontinued drug must be taken into account to limit the risk of interactions during the transition. Combining two antidepressants mainly increases the risk of adverse effects, without a tangible clinical benefit. Two meta-analyses suggest that adding a so-called atypical neuroleptic to ongoing antidepressant therapy leads to 1 extra remission per 7 to 10 treated patients, but also to treatment cessation due to adverse effects in 8% to 9% of cases. Older neuroleptics have not been properly evaluated in this setting. Comparative trials suggest that lithium may have a certain antidepressant effect in this setting, but there is no firm evidence that adding lithium increases the chances of remission. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic margin and overdose can be fatal; the blood lithium concentration must therefore be monitored. Adding an antiepileptic or a psychostimulant is more harmful than beneficial. Adding a thyroid hormone, a benzodiazepine, buspirone or pindolol has no proven antidepressive effect. Four trials, each including fewer than 20 patients, have assessed the efficacy of psychotherapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Two of them provided positive results. Electroconvulsive therapy is probably effective for some patients with refractory depression but it necessitates general anaesthesia and carries a risk of memory disorders. Vagal nerve electrostimulation has no proven efficacy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation seems to have some efficacy and few adverse effects, but its optimal modalities remain to be determined. In practice, when the patient and doctor decide to attempt second-line therapy for treatment-resistant depression, adverse effects must be taken into account in the choice of drug(s). Maintaining a good quality relationship between patient and doctor may be more important than attempting to obtain remission \"at any cost\".",

Twelve healthy participants (8 men) completed this open-label, single-sequence pharmacokinetic study. Healthy volunteers received single oral doses of midazolam 8 mg and fexofenadine 120 mg, before and after 28 days of P ginseng 500 mg twice daily. Midazolam and fexofenadine pharmacokinetic parameter values were calculated and compared before and after P ginseng administration. Geometric mean ratios (postginseng/preginseng) for midazolam area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(0-\u221e)), half-life (t(1/2)), and maximum concentration (C(max)) were significantly reduced at 0.66 (0.55-0.78), 0.71 (0.53-0.90), and 0.74 (0.56-0.93), respectively.

    "78": "Local control of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) depends on the spatial organization of L-type Ca(2+) channels and ryanodine receptors (RyR) in the dyad. Analogously, Ca(2+) uptake by mitochondria is facilitated by their close proximity to the Ca(2+) release sites, a process required for stimulating oxidative phosphorylation during changes in work. Mitochondrial feedback on CICR is less well understood. Since mitochondria are a primary source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), they could potentially influence the cytosolic redox state, in turn altering RyR open probability. We have shown that self-sustained oscillations in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8(m)), NADH, ROS, and reduced glutathione (GSH) can be triggered by a laser flash in cardiomyocytes. Here, we employ this method to directly examine how acute changes in energy state dynamically influence resting Ca(2+) spark occurrence and properties. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy was used to monitor cytosolic Ca(2+) (or ROS), \u0394\u03a8(m), and NADH (or GSH) simultaneously in isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes. Resting Ca(2+) spark frequency increased with each \u0394\u03a8(m) depolarization and decreased with \u0394\u03a8(m) repolarization without affecting Ca(2+) spark amplitude or time-to-peak. Stabilization of mitochondrial energetics by pretreatment with the superoxide scavenger TMPyP, or by acute addition of 4'-chlorodiazepam, a mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that blocks the inner membrane anion channel, prevented or reversed, respectively, the increased spark frequency. Cyclosporine A did not block the \u0394\u03a8(m) oscillations or prevent Ca(2+) spark modulation by \u0394\u03a8(m). The results support the hypothesis that mitochondria exert an influential role on the redox environment of the Ca(2+) handling subsystem, with mechanistic implications for the pathophysiology of cardiac disease.",

In addition, the locomotor activity was measured at the end of the restraint period. Immobilization was induced to animals for 24 hr, and then, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity and content, and mitochondrial function were all estimated in striatal tissue samples. Corticosterone levels were measured in serum. Diazepam was given to rats as a pre-treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.) 20 min. before the initiation of stress. Our results indicate that acute stress produced enhanced striatal levels of lipid peroxidation (73% above the control), decreased superoxide dismutase activity (54% below the control), reduced levels of mitochondrial function (35% below the control) and increased corticosterone serum levels (86% above the control). Pre-treatment of stressed rats with diazepam decreased the striatal lipid peroxidation levels (68% below the stress group) and improved mitochondrial function (18% above the stress group), but only mild preservation of superoxide dismutase activity was detected (17% above the stress group). In regard to the motor assessment, only the stereotyped activity was increased in the stress group with respect to control (46% above the control), and this effect was prevented by diazepam administration (30% below the stress group). The preventive actions of diazepam in this acute model of stress suggest that drugs exhibiting anxiolytic and antioxidant properties might be useful for the design of therapies against early acute phases of physic stress.",

Toxicological analysis based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed THP and its major metabolite (hydroxy-THP) in blood and urine, with THP concentrations of 0.053 and 0.560 mg/L, respectively. The blood and urine ethanol concentrations were low 0.096 and 0.100 g/L, respectively. Based on these results, we determined the cause of death to be THP poisoning.

    "85": "Exposure of the central nervous system to organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents causes seizures and neuronal cell death. Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat seizures induced by OPs. However, it is known that soman-induced seizures are particularly resistant to benzodiazepine treatment, as compared with other OPs. This study investigated the effect of soman on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in acute rat hippocampal slices and the surface expression of GABA(A) receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Results showed that GABA-mediated inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs) are significantly reduced by soman in a concentration-dependent manner in acute rat hippocampal slices. Furthermore, confocal microscopic and cell-based ELISA assays revealed that soman caused rapid internalization of GABA(A) receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The effect of soman on GABA(A)R endocytosis was not due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) because (1) the acetylcholine muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine did not block soman-induced GABA(A)R endocytosis; and (2) physostigmine, at concentrations that completely inhibit AChE activity, did not cause GABA(A)R endocytosis. Moreover, blocking of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) had no effect on soman-induced GABA(A)R endocytosis, suggesting that the soman effect was not secondary to glutamate receptor over activation. Regardless of the exact mechanism, the observation that soman induces rapid GABA(A)R endocytosis may have significant implications in the development of effective countermeasures against soman-induced seizures.", 
    "86": "Lavender oil has a long history of use for treating anxiety, but only recent research has examined its effects using standard behavioural methods used to test novel drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inhaled lavender oil on anxiety related behaviour of rats in the open field and to compare them with the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), a typical anxiolytic drug. Additionally c-fos immunochemistry was used to investigate whether lavender oil produced the same pattern of c-fos expression as CDP in eight different brain areas associated with anxiety. As previously found, lavender oil showed anxiolytic properties in the open field similar to but not as extensive as those of CDP. Immunochemistry results indicated that exposure to the open field increased c-fos expression, while CDP reversed the effects of this behavioural stressor on c-fos expression in all brain regions examined except the central nucleus of the amygdala, where c-fos expression increased. Lavender oil had similar effects to CDP on the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and the central nucleus of the amygdala. These results strengthen the suggestion that inhaling lavender oil has anxiolytic behavioural effects, but they are weaker than the effects of benzodiazepines, and there is limited evidence that they are mediated by the same neural processes.",

The present study investigated the prospective impact of baseline psychiatric comorbidities and treatment regimens on clinical outcomes in bipolar alcoholics. Data were drawn from an 8-week randomized controlled clinical trial of acamprosate for individuals (n=30) with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Depressive and manic symptoms, and alcohol craving and consumption were monitored longitudinally using standardized instruments. Path analysis was used to estimate the prospective associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. More than 50% of patients were diagnosed with at least one anxiety (76.7%) or drug dependence disorder (60.0%). Comorbid anxiety disorders were prospectively associated with increased depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Participants were prescribed an average of 2.6 psychotropic medications at baseline. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants were prospectively associated with increased alcohol use; anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines were associated with increased alcohol craving. Antidepressants were associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conversely, lithium was associated with decreased alcohol craving and depressive symptoms.

Taking advantage of improved sample homogeneity through matrix-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles (matrix@MNP) and the seed-layer method, we report a new strategy for the rapid identification and quantification of drugs in urine samples, using morphine and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7-aminoFM2) as model compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt using the seed-layer method for small molecule analysis. By applying the proposed seed-layer method, which was specifically optimized for the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid@MNP (DHB@MNP) matrix, homogeneous sample crystallization examined by microscopy analysis was obtained that generated reproducible MALDI signals (RSD<10.0%). For urine sample analysis, simple liquid-liquid extraction as a sample pretreatment step effectively reduced the ion suppression effect caused by the endogenous components in urine; good recoveries (82-90%) were obtained with a small ion suppression effect (<14% of signal decrease). This newly developed method demonstrated good quantitation linearity over a range of 50-2000 ng mL(-1) (R(2)>0.996) with reduced signal variation (RSD<10.0%). The detection limit is 30 ng mL(-1) with good precision (intra-day, 2.0-9.3%; inter-day, 5.0-10.0%) and accuracy (intra-day, 95.0-106.0%; inter-day, 103.0-115.5%).

    "90": "Zolpidem is a short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic that binds at the benzodiazepine binding site on specific GABA(A) receptors to enhance fast inhibitory neurotransmission. The behavioral and receptor pharmacology of zolpidem has been studied extensively, but little is known about its neuronal substrates in vivo. In the present within-subject, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study, blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) at 3 Tesla was used to assess the effects of zolpidem within the brain. Healthy participants (n=12) were scanned 60 min after acute oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20mg), and changes in BOLD signal were measured in the visual cortex during presentation of a flashing checkerboard. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored continuously throughout the session. Zolpidem (10 and 20mg) reduced the robust visual system activation produced by presentation of this stimulus, but had no effects on physiological activity during the fMRI scan. Zolpidem's modulation of the BOLD signal within the visual cortex is consistent with the abundant distribution of GABA(A) receptors localized in this region, as well as previous studies showing a relationship between increased GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition and a reduction in BOLD activation.", 
    "91": "Neuroactive steroids produce effects similar to other GABA(A) modulators (e.g., benzodiazepines and barbiturates) and have a large therapeutic potential; however, a greater understanding of the effects of these substances on learning and memory is needed. To specifically assess the effects of a neurosteroid on memory, pregnanolone (1-18 mg/kg) was administered to male Long-Evans rats responding under a repeated acquisition and delayed-performance procedure in which different 4-response sequences were acquired and then retested after varying delays. Responding was maintained under a second-order fixed-ratio (FR) 2 schedule of food reinforcement, and incorrect responses (errors) produced a 5-sec timeout. For comparison purposes, both a high (flunitrazepam) and low efficacy agonist/antagonist (flumazenil) of the GABA(A) receptor complex were also administered both alone and in combination. Retention of each sequence was quantified as percent savings in errors-to-criterion and this dependent measure was shown to be sensitive to increases in delay. When administered 15 min prior to the end of either a 30- or 180-minute delay, pregnanolone produced both dose- and delay-dependent decreases in percent savings, response rate and accuracy; this effect was selective in that decreases in retention occurred at doses lower than those that disrupted response rate or accuracy. Flunitrazepam (0.056-1mg/kg) produced similar disruptions in retention and these disruptions were antagonized by 5.6 mg/kg of flumazenil. Both an ineffective (0.056 mg/kg) and an effective (0.18 mg/kg) dose of flunitrazepam also potentiated the dose- and delay-dependent disruptions in retention produced by pregnanolone. These data indicate that the neurosteroid pregnanolone disrupts retention in a manner similar to the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam, and suggests that the interaction of flunitrazepam and pregnanolone on retention may be mediated by the GABA(A) receptor complex.",

Thus, we determined whether stress-induced enhancement of inflammatory hyperalgesia is mediated by an imbalance between glutamate and GABA neurotransmission. Male rats were subjected daily to 10 to 20 minutes per day of either forced swimming (FS) or sham swimming for 3 consecutive days; nonconditioned rats served as controls. Some rats were treated i.p. with ketamine (5 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg), flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg), or vehicle (0.9% NaCl), 30 to 60 minutes before each conditioning session or nociception assessment. Pain behavior, spinal nociceptive neuronal activation and GABA and glutamate release were respectively evaluated by the formalin test, the expression of c-Fos and in vivo microdialysis of superficial laminae of the lumbar spinal cord, 48 hours after the last conditioning session. Nitric oxide metabolites (NO(x)) were determined as markers of post-synaptic NMDA receptor activation. FS stress enhanced formalin-induced hyperalgesia, increased pain-elicited c-Fos expression, decreased basal and delayed pain-induced GABA release, and increased basal and induced glutamate release. Hyperalgesia and c-Fos overexpression were blocked only by prestress treatment with diazepam and post-stress treatment with ketamine, whereas changes in GABA and glutamate release were reversed by prestress treatment with diazepam. Diazepam effects were blocked by flumazenil. NO(x) increased in lumbar spinal cord of FS rats by a mechanism antagonized by ketamine. Thus, stress-induced hyperalgesia is initiated by a decreased and delayed GABA release and GABA-A receptor activation, whereas it is maintained by increased glutamate release and NMDA glutamate receptor activation at the spinal level.", 
    "109": "The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of olanzapine and risperidone for the acute treatment of first-episode schizophrenia patients with cannabis use disorders. This secondary analysis of a previously published study included 49 first-episode patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder and a co-occurring lifetime diagnosis of cannabis use disorders randomly assigned to treatment with either olanzapine (n=28) or risperidone (n=21) for 16weeks. The olanzapine group did not differ significantly from the risperidone group for initial response rates of positive symptoms, and rates of cannabis use or alcohol use during the study. Positive symptoms and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) global asociality-anhedonia scores improved over time but did not differ between study medications. In both groups, cannabis use during the study was higher in patients who used cannabis within three months of the admission. Thus, our results suggest that olanzapine and risperidone had a similar initial efficacy on psychotic symptoms and substance use in first-episode patients with co-occurring cannabis use disorders. If clinicians are choosing between olanzapine versus risperidone treatment for this population, their decision should be based upon factors other than symptom response and short-term substance misuse.", 
    "110": "We previously found that the glutamate release was decreased in synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex during the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis. Various other reports have shown a deficit in the expression of proteins associated with GABAergic neurotransmission in the neocortex of patients with multiple sclerosis and it was also demonstrated that the activation of GABAA receptors leads to an inhibition of glutamate release. Now, in order to evaluate the events that may affect the neuronal function in EAE synaptosomes, we analyzed the participation of the GABAergic system in glutamate release and in the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density. This revealed alterations in the GABAergic system of the frontal cortex synaptosomes from EAE animals. GABA induced a decrease in the 4-aminopyridine-evoked glutamate release in control synaptosomes which was abolished by picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist. In contrast, synaptosomes from EAE rats showed a loss in the inhibition of glutamate release mediated by GABA. Furthermore, the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density was decreased during the acute stage of the disease in synaptosomes from EAE rats. We also observed a loss of inhibition in the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I mediated by GABA in nerve terminals from EAE animals, which could explain the loss of GABAergic regulation on evoked glutamate release. The changes observed in the GABAA receptor density as well as the loss of GABAergic inhibition of glutamate release were partially reverted in cortical synaptosomes from recovered EAE animals. These results suggest that the decrease in the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor density may explain the observed failure of GABAergic regulation in the glutamate release of synaptosomes from EAE rats, which might contribute to the appearance of clinical symptoms and disease progression.", 
    "111": "Stress is a well-known risk factor in relapse to drug abuse. Several forms of stress in animals have been used with varied degrees of success to elicit reinstatement of drug-seeking after chronic drug self-administration. Here, we tested the ability of the benzodiazepine (BZ) inverse agonist, FG 7142, to elicit anxiety-like behavior and potentiate stress responses in rats as measured by standard behavioral and hormonal indices and for its ability to affect reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in rats with a prior history of cocaine self-administration. FG 7142 elicited anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze (EPM) in cocaine-na\u00efve rats, and cocaine-na\u00efve rats injected with FG 7142 exhibited increased plasma corticosterone levels following EPM exposure. However, in animals with a history of cocaine self-administration, FG 7142 failed to affect elevated plus maze performance and did not affect plasma corticosterone response to the EPM. Furthermore, FG 7142 failed to reinstate cocaine-seeking, nor did it alter conditioned cue-induced reinstatement. These data indicate that the anxiety-related and stress potentiating qualities of BZ inverse agonism are attenuated in cocaine-experienced animals and do not lead to reinstatement of cocaine-seeking.", 
    "112": "A provoked seizure may be due to structural damage (resulting from traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, stroke, tuberculosis, or neurocysticercosis) or due to metabolic abnormalities (such as alcohol withdrawal and renal or hepatic failure). This article is a part of the Guidelines for Epilepsy in India. This article reviews the problem of provoked seizure and its management and also provides recommendations based on currently available information. Seizure provoked by metabolic disturbances requires correction of the triggering factors. Benzodiazepines are recommended for treatment of seizure due to alcohol withdrawal; gabapentin for seizure seen in porphyria; and antiepileptic drugs (AED), that are not inducer of hepatic enzymes, in the seizures seen in hepatic dysfunction. In severe traumatic brain injury, with or without seizure, phenytoin (PHT) may be given for 7 days. In ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke one may individualize the AED therapy. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), AED may be prescribed if there is seizure or computed tomographic (CT) abnormalities or focal weakness; the treatment, in these cases, has to be continued for 1 year. Prophylactic AED is not recommended in cases of brain tumor and neurosurgical procedures and if patient is on an AED it can be stopped after 1 week.", 
    "113": "Spinal dorsal horn GABA(A) receptors are found both postsynaptically on central neurons and presynaptically on axons and/or terminals of primary sensory neurons, where they mediate primary afferent depolarization (PAD) and presynaptic inhibition. Both phenomena have been studied extensively on a cellular level, but their role in sensory processing in vivo has remained elusive, due to inherent difficulties to selectively interfere with presynaptic receptors. Here, we address the contribution of a major subpopulation of GABA(A) receptors (those containing the \u03b12 subunit) to spinal pain control in mice lacking \u03b12-GABA(A) receptors specifically in primary nociceptors (sns-\u03b12(-/-) mice). sns-\u03b12(-/-) mice exhibited GABA(A) receptor currents and dorsal root potentials of normal amplitude in vitro, and normal response thresholds to thermal and mechanical stimulation in vivo, and developed normal inflammatory and neuropathic pain sensitization. However, the positive allosteric GABA(A) receptor modulator diazepam (DZP) had almost completely lost its potentiating effect on PAD and presynaptic inhibition in vitro and a major part of its spinal antihyperalgesic action against inflammatory hyperalgesia in vivo. Our results thus show that part of the antihyperalgesic action of spinally applied DZP occurs through facilitated activation of GABA(A) receptors residing on primary nociceptors.", 
    "114": "Among some alcohol-dependent individuals, early alcohol abstinence is marked by alcohol withdrawal (AW), a phenomenon mediated by GABA and glutamate signaling. We previously reported that a combination of 2 medications that affect GABA and glutamate tone, gabapentin and flumazenil, more effectively reduced drinking among individuals with higher pretreatment AW (Anton et al., 2009). This study evaluated whether this finding is related to changes in neurocognitive performance, which is also affected by cortical GABA and glutamate tone.", 
    "115": "Neurocognitive performance was assessed at baseline and twice during the first week of treatment among 60 alcohol-dependent participants in the previously published clinical trial.", 
    "116": "AW was associated with poorer baseline performance on 4 of 8 measures, and individuals with higher baseline AW who received the gabapentin and flumazenil combination demonstrated greater improvement on a measure of response inhibition than those with lower AW or those who received a combination of placebos. Improvement in response inhibition during the first week and medication group interacted in their effect on subsequent drinking, such that improvement predicted greater abstinence only among individuals who received gabapentin and flumazenil. Improvement on other neurocognitive measures was neither differentially impacted by medication or baseline AW nor related to subsequent drinking.", 
    "117": "Taken together, these data suggest that acute AW accounts for a small proportion of variance in neurocognitive performance, that gabapentin and flumazenil slightly improve response inhibition during early abstinence, and that such improvement may somewhat reduce later drinking. However, these medications may not affect other neurocognitive domains.", 
    "118": "Solubility of drugs in binary and ternary solvent mixtures composed of water and pharmaceutical cosolvents at different temperatures were predicted using the Jouyban-Acree model and a combination of partial solubility parameters as interaction descriptors in the solution. The generally trained version of the model produced the overall mean percentage deviation values for the back-calculated solubility of drugs in binary solvents of 34.3% and the predicted solubilities in ternary solvent mixtures of 38.0%. In addition, the applicability of the trained model for predicting the solvent composition providing the maximum solubility of a drug was investigated. The results of collected solubility data of drugs in various mixed solvents and the newly measured solubility data of five drugs in ethanol + propylene glycol + water mixtures at 25\u00b0C showed that the model provided acceptable predictions and could be used in the pharmaceutical industry.", 
    "119": "Propofol and midazolam have a synergistic anesthetic action. One of the reasons for this is thought to be the inhibitory effect of propofol on midazolam metabolism. However, because both drugs bind strongly to serum protein, their interaction may not only involve the effects of propofol on midazolam metabolism, but may also involve propofol's effects on serum protein-binding. Against this background, we investigated the characteristics of midazolam binding to serum albumin, and evaluated the effects of both propofol and ketamine on this binding. Midazolam was added to a serum albumin solution with propofol or ketamine, and, after incubation for 1\u00a0h, albumin-free solution was separated from the sample and the midazolam concentration was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography system. The albumin-unbound rate of midazolam was evaluated and compared with the rate in the control solution (only midazolam). Propofol significantly raised the rate of albumin-unbound free midazolam, while ketamine had no effect on the binding of midazolam to serum albumin. These findings suggest that the increase in albumin-unbound free midazolam brought about by propofol is involved in the synergistic effect of these two agents.", 
    "120": "Two decades of pharmacologic research on the human capacity to implicitly acquire knowledge as well as cognitive skills and procedures have yielded surprisingly few conclusive insights. We review the empirical literature of the neuropharmacology of implicit learning. We evaluate the findings in the context of relevant computational models related to neurotransmittors such as dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and noradrenalin. These include models for reinforcement learning, sequence production, and categorization. We conclude, based on the reviewed literature, that one can predict improved implicit acquisition by moderately elevated dopamine levels and impaired implicit acquisition by moderately decreased dopamine levels. These effects are most prominent in the dorsal striatum. This is supported by a range of behavioral tasks in the empirical literature. Similar predictions can be made for serotonin, although there is yet a lack of support in the literature for serotonin involvement in classical implicit learning tasks. There is currently a lack of evidence for a role of the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems in implicit and related forms of learning. GABA modulators, including benzodiazepines, seem to affect implicit learning in a complex manner and further research is needed. Finally, we identify allosteric AMPA receptors modulators as a potentially interesting target for future investigation of the neuropharmacology of procedural and implicit learning.", 
    "121": "Under extreme conditions of heat exposure and exercise stress, the human body undergoes major physiological changes. Perturbations in organ blood flows, gastrointestinal properties, and vascular physiology may impact the body's ability to absorb, distribute, and eliminate drugs. Clinical studies on the effect of these stressors on drug pharmacokinetics demonstrate that the likelihood of pharmacokinetic alteration is dependent on drug properties and the intensity of the stressor. The objectives of this study were to use literature data to quantify the correlation between exercise and heat exposure intensity to changing physiological parameters and further, to use this information for the parameterization of a whole-body, physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the purposes of determining those drug properties most likely to demonstrate altered drug pharmacokinetics under stress. Cardiac output and most organ blood flows were correlated with heart rate using regression analysis. Other altered parameters included hematocrit and intravascular albumin concentration. Pharmacokinetic simulations of intravenous and oral administration of hypothetical drugs with either a low or high value of lipophilicity, unbound fraction in plasma, and unbound intrinsic hepatic clearance demonstrated that the area under the curve of those drugs with a high unbound intrinsic clearance was most affected (up to a 130% increase) following intravenous administration, whereas following oral administration, pharmacokinetic changes were smaller (<40% increase in area under the curve) for all hypothetical compounds. A midazolam physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was also used to demonstrate that simulated changes in pharmacokinetic parameters under exercise and heat stress were generally consistent with those reported in the literature.",

Her metabolism was kept stable throughout the intraoperative period. However, on the second postoperative day, she developed rhabdomyolysis and was treated with glucose containing infusion. This case provides instructive information that strict management is needed for patients with trifunctional protein deficiency in the perioperative period.",

    "127": "This study proposes a computational model for attentional blink or \"blink of the mind,\" a phenomenon where a human subject misses perception of a later expected visual pattern as two expected visual patterns are presented less than 500\u2009ms apart. A neocortical patch modeled as an attractor network is stimulated with a sequence of 14 patterns 100\u2009ms apart, two of which are expected targets. Patterns that become active attractors are considered recognized. A neocortical patch is represented as a square matrix of hypercolumns, each containing a set of minicolumns with synaptic connections within and across both minicolumns and hypercolumns. Each minicolumn consists of locally connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells with interacting basket cells and layer 4 pyramidal cells for input stimulation. All neurons are implemented using the Hodgkin-Huxley multi-compartmental cell formalism and include calcium dynamics, and they interact via saturating and depressing AMPA/NMDA and GABA(A) synapses. Stored patterns are encoded with global connectivity of minicolumns across hypercolumns and active patterns compete as the result of lateral inhibition in the network. Stored patterns were stimulated over time intervals to create attractor interference measurable with synthetic spike traces. This setup corresponds with item presentations in human visual attentional blink studies. Stored target patterns were depolarized while distractor patterns where hyperpolarized to represent expectation of items in working memory. Simulations replicated the basic attentional blink phenomena and showed a reduced blink when targets were more salient. Studies on the inhibitory effect of benzodiazepines on attentional blink in human subjects were compared with neocortical simulations where the GABA(A) receptor conductance and decay time were increased. Simulations showed increases in the attentional blink duration, agreeing with observations in human studies. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed on key parameters of the model, including Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channel conductance, synaptic depression, GABA(A) channel conductance and the NMDA/AMPA ratio of charge entry.", 
    "128": "The hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory. Synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, short-term and long-term, is postulated to be a neural substrate of memory trace. Paired-pulse stimulation is a standard technique for evaluating a form of short-term synaptic plasticity in rodents. However, evidence is lacking for paired-pulse responses in the primate hippocampus. In the present study, we recorded paired-pulse responses in the dentate gyrus of monkeys while stimulating to the medial part of the perforant path at several inter-pulse intervals (IPIs) using low and high stimulus intensities. When the stimulus intensity was low, the first pulse produced early strong depression (at IPIs of 10-30 ms) and late slight depression (at IPIs of 100-1000 ms) of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) generated by the second pulse, interposing no depression IPIs (50-70 ms). When the stimulus intensity was high, fEPSPs generated by the second pulse were depressed by the first pulse at all IPIs except for the longest one (2000 ms). Population spikes (PSs) generated by the second pulse were completely blocked or strongly depressed at shorter IPIs (10-100 or 200 ms, respectively), while no depression or slight facilitation occurred at longer IPIs (500-2000 ms). Administration of diazepam slightly increased fEPSPs, while it decreased PSs produced by the first pulse. It also enhanced the facilitation of PSs produced by the second stimulation at longer IPIs. The present results, in comparison with previous studies using rodents, indicate that paired-pulse responses of fEPSPs in the monkey are basically similar to those of rodents, although paired-pulse responses of PSs in the monkey are more delayed than those in rodents and have a different sensitivity to diazepam.", 
    "129": "We tested the efficacy of treatment with talampanel in a mutant SOD1 mouse model of ALS by measuring intracellular calcium levels and loss of spinal motor neurons. We intended to mimic the clinical study; hence, treatment was started when the clinical symptoms were already present. The data were compared with the results of similar treatment started at a presymptomatic stage. Transgenic and wild-type mice were treated either with talampanel or with vehicle, starting in presymptomatic or symptomatic stages. The density of motor neurons was determined by the physical disector, and their intracellular calcium level was assayed electron microscopically. Results showed that motor neurons in the SOD1 mice exhibited an elevated calcium level, which could be reduced, but not restored, with talampanel only when the treatment was started presymptomatically. Treatment in either presymptomatic or symptomatic stages failed to rescue the motor neurons. We conclude that talampanel reduces motoneuronal calcium in a mouse model of ALS, but its efficacy declines as the disease progresses, suggesting that medication initiation in the earlier stages of the disease might be more effective.",

RNA levels of Cyp2e1, Cyp1a2 and the drug transporters, multidrug resistance proteins, (Mrp)2, Mrp3 and multidrug resistant gene (Mdr)1b were unaltered in HFD mice. Gene expression of the NRs, PXR and CAR and nuclear protein levels of RXR\u03b1 was reduced in HFD mice. Cytokines, JNK and NF-\u03ba\u0392 were induced in HFD mice. Thus reduction in hepatic gene expression in obesity may be modulated by cross-talk between NRs and inflammation-induced cell-signaling.

Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult marmosets by pilocarpine injection (250mg/kg; i.p.). The animals were divided in 2 groups: acute (8h post-SE) and chronic (3 and 5 months post-SE). To manage the severity of SE, animals received diazepam 5min after the SE onset (acute group: 2.5 or 1.25mg/kg; i.p.; chronic group/; 1.25mg/kg; i.p). All animals were monitored by video and electrocorticography to assess SE and subsequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). To evaluate brain injury produced by SE or SRS we used argyrophil III, Nissl and neo-Timm staining techniques. Magnetic resonance image was also performed in the chronic group. We observed that pilocarpine was able to induce SE followed by SRS after a variable period of time. Prolonged SE episodes were associated with brain damage, mostly confined to the hippocampus and limbic structures. Similar to human TLE, anatomical disruption of dentate gyrus was observed after SRS. Our data suggest that pilocarpine marmoset model of epilepsy has great resemblance to human TLE, and could provide new tools to further evaluate the subtle changes associated with human epilepsy.",

The validation parameters of the method, including selectivity, linearity, limits of detection and quantification (LOQ), recovery, intra- and interassay precision and accuracy, and processed sample stability, were satisfactory. Moreover, the developed method was successfully applied to actual cases. In case 1, which involved a pop singer who was detained for suspected drug abuse, the concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam were 5.7 and 2.0 ng/mg in nonpigmented hair and 6.6 and 1.8 ng/mg in pigmented hair, respectively.

    "151": "The most difficult questions in pediatric anesthesiology still remain relevant at surgeries to correct congenital maxilla-facial pathologies, accompanied by severe respiratory distress, speech and auditory sensation. For a long time the anesthetics were widely used among the neonatal and young children with extreme care due to their indicated suppressive effects on the immature organ systems. According to this fact, the choice of anesthesia is a matter of extremely importance. In addition, the study of molecular mechanisms indicating to the adverse effects induced by application of anesthesia will make it possible to develop therapeutic strategies for prevention of postoperative complications. The purpose of present study is to investigate a change of the quantity of GABA positive cells in the hippocampus of white adult rats under the conditions of halothane narcosis and with the premedication by midazolam. Subjects of a study - 30 adult white rats with the weight of 130-140 g. Animals were subdivided into three groups. I group - intact animals; II group - sham-operated rats under the conditions of halothane narcosis; III group - sham-operated animals, premedicated by midazolam, under the halothane narcosis. A change in the quantity of GABA positive cells was determined by the immunohistochemical method (Rabbit Anti-GABA). All data were processed by the method of standard variation statistics. The authenticity of results was evaluated according to the Student's criterion within limits of 95-99% reliability. The results of conducted by us studies revealed, that during the application of halothane narcosis causes an increase in the GABA positive cells in the fields CA1 on hippocampus of adult white rats. In 24 hours after sham operation, at the condition of application of halothane narcosis a quantity of GABA positive cells raises in the CA3 field of hippocampus in II group animals as well. Moreover, in the CA1 field correlation between GAD65/67 positive and GABA positive cells is revealed which was not observed at later stages. The study of this question is the purpose of our next investigations.", 
    "152": "Second-generation antipsychotics yield only a modest improvement in cognitive benefit compared to first-generation antipsychotics. Aripiprazole, which is a partial dopamine D2 receptor agonist, may have an impact on cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. This study administered aripiprazole or placebo to 36 outpatients with schizophrenia also receiving risperidone or olanzapine for 12 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) just prior to drug administration as well as 12 weeks after. The PANSS and UKU side effect rating scales were used to evaluate the clinical response to additional treatment with aripiprazole. In a primary analyses, ANCOVA showed that there was an interaction between the treatment group and time for verbal fluency (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not for any domain in BACS, PANSS or UKU side effect rating scales. Upon secondary analysis, however, the ameliorative change in motor speed as assessed by the BACS (p\u2009<\u20090.05) for those receiving aripiprazole was greater than that for the placebo group, whereas deterioration in verbal fluency (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and executive function (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in those receiving aripiprazole was significantly greater than in the placebo group. These results suggest that adjunctive treatment with aripiprazole improves motor speed but worsens some cognitive functions. It is likely that these effects are due to the dopamine D2 antagonistic effect of aripiprazole.", 
    "153": "The potent sedative-hypnotic zolpidem and the convulsant methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) act primarily by binding to the benzodiazepine site of the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, the pentameric \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)). This binding depends critically on the wild-type F77 residue of the GABA(A) receptor \u03b32 subunit. Mice with \u03b32 subunit F77I point mutation (\u03b32I77 mouse line) lose the high-affinity nanomolar binding of these ligands as well as their most robust behavioral actions at low doses. Interestingly, the \u03b32I77 mice offer a tool to study the actions of these substances mediated via other possible binding sites of the GABA(A) receptor. In ligand autoradiographic experiments, we discovered in \u03b32I77 mouse brain sections a significant amount of residual non-\u03b32 subunit-dependent benzodiazepine site binding enriched to the striatum and septum. Zolpidem only weakly affected this residual binding at micromolar concentrations, and only a high zolpidem dose (\u2265 40 mg/kg) caused sedation and deficits in motor coordination in \u03b32I77 mice. DMCM had an agonistic action through a secondary, low-affinity non-benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptor in the forebrain of \u03b32I77 mice, and this drug also fully displaced the residual benzodiazepine-site labeling. In behavioral tests, a high dose (20mg/kg) of DMCM was sedative and modulated fear learning. DMCM, but not zolpidem, acted as an agonist in recombinant GABA(A) \u03b11/6\u03b23 receptors studied using ligand binding and electrophysiological assays. Our results highlight the less well-known actions of high doses of DMCM and zolpidem that are not mediated via the \u03b32 subunit-containing benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "154": "Introduced in the early 1960s, diazepam remains among the most frequently prescribed benzodiazepine-type sedatives and hypnotics. Patients with chronic use of short-acting benzodiazepines are frequently switched to diazepam because the accumulating, long-acting metabolite, N-desmethyl-diazepam, prevents benzodiazepine-associated withdrawal symptoms, which can occur during trough plasma levels of short-acting benzodiazepines. Although mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms are frequently observed during benzodiazepine switching to diazepam, severe medical complications associated with this treatment approach have thus far not been reported.",

Subsequent to the benzodiazepine switch, our patient unexpectedly developed an acute delirious state, which quickly remitted after re-administration of lorazepam. A newly diagnosed early form of mixed dementia, combining both vascular and Alzheimer-type lesions, was found as a likely contributing factor for the observed vulnerability to benzodiazepine-induced withdrawal symptoms.",

However, contrary to common clinical practice, benzodiazepine switching to diazepam may require cross-titration with slow tapering of the first benzodiazepine to allow for the build-up of N-desmethyl-diazepam, in order to safely prevent severe withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively, long-term treatment with low doses of benzodiazepines may be considered, especially in elderly patients with chronic use of benzodiazepines and proven vulnerability to benzodiazepine-associated withdrawal symptoms.",

Despite its clinical relevance, anxiety in schizophrenia remains poorly understood. In the prodromic phase, anxiety indicates a progression towards psychotic decompensation. After a first episode, it is an indicator of relapse.", 
    "158": "Two approaches have been used to investigate anxiety in schizophrenia: (i) categorical approach (comorbidity of schizophrenia and anxiety disorders) and (ii) dimensional approach (anxiety as a major symptom of the \"dysphoric\" dimension). Clinical categorical studies reported an increased frequency of comorbidity between schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and specific phobia. The dimensional approach proposes that five different factors contribute to the structure of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), with anxiety as a major symptom of the \"dysphoria\" dimension. Concerning diagnosis, it is unclear whether psychotic and neurotic anxiety differs in nature or intensity. Nevertheless, both are frequently opposed.", 
    "159": "Psychotic anxiety is intense, profound and hermetic. In contrast to neurotic anxiety, it is associated with psychomotor disturbances, such as agitation and sideration. There is no specific tool to evaluate anxiety in schizophrenia. The dimensional approach usually runs an evaluation using items or factors extracted from the most widely-used scales, i.e. PANSS or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or from anxiety scales developed in non-schizophrenic populations, such as the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Recently, we developed a specific scale for hetero-evaluation (\u00c9chelle Anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 Schizophr\u00e9nie [EAS scale]). The EAS scale was recently validated and the study of its sensitivity is ongoing. THERAPEUTICAL ISSUES: Several studies have examined the effects of antipsychotics on the anxious/depressive cluster extracted from the PANSS, and some other studies have specifically evaluated the effect of antipsychotics on depressive symptoms using the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), but to our knowledge, no study has reported the effect of antipsychotics or other treatment on anxiety when using a schizophrenia-specific scale. There are no specific guideline treatments for anxiety in schizophrenia. Among phenothiazines, cyamemazine is frequently prescribed in France, because of its potent anxiolytic activity and good neurological tolerance. Some authors have suggested a specific treatment with benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines should be used with caution, due to undesirable actions such as dependence, rebound and potentiation of certain lateral effects.",

    "163": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) infusion has been shown to reduce blood pressure in both humans and animals. Although the inhibitory effects of BDZ on the central nervous system have been well documented, less is known about the direct effects of BDZ on the vascular bed. The aims of this study were to assess the effects of the BDZ midazolam on the vascular system in C57/BL6 mouse aortic rings and to investigate the mechanisms of its direct vascular action. We found that midazolam induced reversible, dose-dependent vasodilation in potassium- and phenylephrine-precontracted rings. In rings that were precontracted with potassium or phenylephrine, treatment with 10 \u03bcmol l(-1) midazolam increased vasodilation by 15 and 60%, respectively, compared with baseline. Vasodilation increased by 80 and 87%, respectively, after treatment with 50 \u03bcmol l(-1) midazolam. Only the low concentration of midazolam (10 \u03bcmol l(-1)) induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in phenylephrine-precontracted rings. Vasodilation increased by 60% in rings with endothelium and by 20% in rings without endothelium. Conversely, only the high concentration of midazolam (50 \u03bcmol l(-1)) reduced the CaCl(2)-induced vasoconstriction of aortic rings with EC(50) (the concentration giving 50% of the maximal effect) values of 1 and 6 mmol l(-1) for vehicle- and midazolam-treated rings, respectively. Furthermore, the incubation of phenylephrine-precontracted rings with an inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or the inhibitors of central or peripheral type BDZ receptors (flumazenil or PK 11195, respectively) produced no change in midazolam-induced vasodilation. Thus, low concentrations of midazolam induce vasodilation via an endothelium-dependent mechanism that does not involve NO production. In contrast, high concentrations of midazolam induce vasodilation via an endothelium-independent mechanism that implies reduced sensitivity of aortic rings to calcium ions. Additionally, neither the central \u03b3-amino-butyric acid receptor type A nor the peripheral type BDZ receptors seem to be involved in the mechanism of midazolam-induced vasodilation.",

    "165": "The antitumor antibiotic sibiromycin belongs to the class of pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) that are produced by a variety of actinomycetes. PBDs are sequence-specific DNA-alkylating agents and possess significant antitumor properties. Among them, sibiromycin, one of two identified glycosylated PBDs, displays the highest DNA binding affinity and the most potent antitumor activity. In this study, we report the elucidation of the precise reaction sequence leading to the formation and activation of the 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylanthranilic acid building block found in sibiromycin, starting from the known metabolite 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK). The investigated pathway consists of four enzymes, which were biochemically characterized in vitro. Starting from 3HK, the SAM-dependent methyltransferase SibL converts the substrate to its 4-methyl derivative, followed by hydrolysis through the action of the PLP-dependent kynureninase SibQ, leading to 3-hydroxy-4-methylanthranilic acid (3H4MAA) formation. Subsequently the NRPS didomain SibE activates 3H4MAA and tethers it to its thiolation domain, where it is hydroxylated at the C5 position by the FAD/NADH-dependent hydroxylase SibG yielding the fully substituted anthranilate moiety found in sibiromycin. These insights about sibiromycin biosynthesis and the substrate specificities of the biosynthetic enzymes involved may guide future attempts to engineer the PBD biosynthetic machinery and help in the production of PBD derivatives.", 
    "166": "The binding of PET radiotracer [(11)C]flumazenil to the GABA(A) receptors is described by the receptor density (B(max)) and binding affinity (K(D)). The estimation of B(max) and K(D) is usually based on Scatchard analysis including at least two PET scans at steady state of various specific activities. Recently, a novel full saturation method to estimate both B(max) and K(D) was proposed, in which a saturating dose of flumazenil is given to cover a wide range of different receptor occupancies within a single scan. The aim of the present study was a direct comparison of steady state and full saturation methods for determining B(max) and K(D) of [(11)C]flumazenil in the same group of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Fourteen rats underwent 3 consecutive [(11)C]flumazenil scans of 30 min duration each. A tracer dose was injected at the start of the first scan. Prior to the second scan the tracer was mixed with 5, 20, 100 or 500 \u03bcg unlabelled (cold) flumazenil to cover a wide range of receptor occupancies during the scan. The third scan was performed during a constant intravenous infusion of unlabelled flumazenil, resulting in ~50% GABA(A) receptor occupancy. The first and third scans were part of the steady state method, whilst the second scan was performed according to the full saturation method. For both methods, B(max) and K(D) were then derived by compartmental modelling. Both methods yielded similar B(max) and K(D) estimates. The full saturation method yielded B(max) values of 37 \u00b1 5.8 ng \u00b7 mL(-1) and K(D) values of 7.6 \u00b1 2.0 ng \u00b7 mL(-1), whilst the steady state method yielded B(max) values of 33 \u00b1 5.4 ng \u00b7 mL(-1) and K(D) values of 7.1 \u00b1 0.8 ng \u00b7 mL(-1). The main advantage of the full saturation method is that B(max) and K(D) can be obtained from a single PET scan.", 
    "167": "Anxiety disorders are frequent and highly disabling diseases with considerable socio-economic impact. In the treatment of anxiety disorders, benzodiazepines (BZDs) as direct modulators of the GABA(A) receptor are used as emergency medication because of their rapid onset of action. However, BZDs act also as sedatives and rather quickly induce tolerance and abuse liability associated with withdrawal symptoms. Antidepressants with anxiolytic properties are also applied as first line long-term treatment of anxiety disorders. However, the onset of action of antidepressants takes several weeks. Obviously, novel pharmacological approaches are needed that combine a rapid anxiolytic efficacy with the lack of tolerance induction, abuse liability and withdrawal symptoms. Neurosteroids are potent allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptor function. The translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) plays an important role for the synthesis of neurosteroids by promoting the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is the rate-limiting step in neurosteroidogenesis. Etifoxine not only exerts anxiolytic effects as a TSPO ligand by enhancing neurosteroidogenesis, but also acts as a weak direct GABA(A) receptor enhancer. The TSPO ligand XBD173 enhances GABAergic neurotransmission via the promotion of neurosteroidogenesis without direct effects at the GABA(A) receptor. XBD173 counteracts pharmacologically-induced panic in rodents in the absence of sedation and tolerance development. Also in humans, XBD173 displays antipanic activity and does not cause sedation and withdrawal symptoms after 7 days of treatment. XBD173 therefore appears to be a promising candidate for fast-acting anxiolytic drugs with less severe side-effects than BZDs. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and TSPO ligands as a novel pharmacological approach in the treatment of these disorders.",

The improved antidepressant effect of many drugs, including OLA and CBZ used in combined therapy - as observed in our clinic - as well as confirmed evidence of OLA's and CBZ's positive effects on cognitive functions in humans and animals substantiated commencement of research on defining the effect of combined administration of OLA and CBZ on sedation (tested in a locomotor activity test), antidepressant effect (Porsolt test) and spatial memory (Morris test) in animals.

We hypothesized that blockade of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), the primary enzyme responsible for 2-AG deactivation in vivo, would produce context-dependent anxiolytic effects in rats. Environmental aversiveness was manipulated by varying illumination of an elevated plus maze. Percentage open arm time and numbers of open and closed arm entries were measured in rats receiving a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of either vehicle, the MGL inhibitor JZL184 (1-8mg/kg), the benzodiazepine diazepam (1mg/kg), the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonist rimonabant (1mg/kg), or JZL184 (8mg/kg) coadministered with rimonabant (1mg/kg). JZL184 (8mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects (i.e., increased percentage open arm time and number of open arm entries) under high, but not low, levels of environmental aversiveness. Diazepam produced anxiolytic effects in either context. Rimonabant blocked the anxiolytic-like effects of JZL184, consistent with mediation by CB(1). Anxiolytic effects of JZL184 were preserved following chronic (8mg/kg per day\u00d76 days) administration. Chronic and acute JZL184 treatment similarly enhanced behavioral sensitivity to an exogenous cannabinoid (WIN55,212-2; 2.5mg/kg i.p.) 24 or 72h following the terminal injection, suggesting a pervasive effect of MGL inhibition on the endocannabinoid system. We attribute our results to alterations in emotion rather than locomotor activity as JZL184 did not alter the number of closed arm entries in the plus maze or produce motor ataxia in the bar test. Our results demonstrate that JZL184 has beneficial, context-dependent effects on anxiety in rats, presumably via inhibition of MGL-mediated hydrolysis of 2-AG. These data warrant further testing of MGL inhibitors to elucidate the functional role of 2-AG in controlling anxiety and stress responsiveness. Our data further implicate a role for 2-AG in the regulation of emotion and validate MGL as a therapeutic target."
