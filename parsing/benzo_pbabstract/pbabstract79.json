There are good randomised controlled studies on the use of benzodiazepines in early status epilepticus, but an inadequate trial base in the later stages. Therapy has therefore to be based on open studies, although in the later stages there is also a dearth of open data. Tonic-clonic status epilepticus is a medical emergency and a condition with a significant mortality. The lack of information compromises optimal therapy. This paper reviews the reasons for the lack of data and the problems associated with collecting data. It is proposed that, in the first instance, the best way of improving the quality of evidence would be a multinational case registry of existing practice.", 
    "1": "A concept of physicochemical forms of biologically active substances introduced in investigation of the action mechanism of ultra-low doses allows qualitative explanation of the main effects of ultra-low doses, chemical diversity of biologically active substances, and physical boundaries for these effects. Phenazepam was shown to possess activity in ultra-low doses only in disperse state, in the form of nanoparticles with a diameter <100-300 nm; these nanoparticles appear as micelles of surface active substances and solvated. Panavir possesses pharmacological activity in ultra-low doses and appears as nanoparticles with a diameter of 200-300 nm, which have uncompensated negative surface charge and polymer nature.", 
    "2": "More effective countermeasures against nerve-agent poisoning are needed, because current ones do not protect sufficiently, particularly the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of the present study was to make a comparison of the antidotal capabilities of atropine/obidoxime/diazepam (termed the obidoxime regimen), atropine/HI-6 (1-[([4-(aminocarbonyl)pyridinio]methoxy)methyl]-2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]pyridinium)/avizafone (termed the HI-6 regimen), and scopolamine/HI-6/physostigmine (termed the physostigmine regimen) against various doses of soman (2, 3, 4 x LD50 ). The results showed that each regimen administered twice (1\u2009min and 5\u2009min after exposure) effectively prevented or terminated epileptiform activity within 10\u2009min. However, the regimens differed markedly in life-saving properties with the physostigmine regimen ranking highest followed in descending order by the HI-6 and obidoxime regimens. Pretreatment with pyridostigmine increased the potency of the HI-6 regimen, but not the obidoxime regimen. The latter regimen administered thrice (1\u2009min, 5\u2009min, and 9\u2009min after exposure) did not compensate for the insufficiency. In half of the rats that lived for 7\u2009days, neuropathology was unexpectedly observed predominantly in the left hemisphere unrelated to whether they seized or not. Local glutamatergic excitotoxic activity may occur even if manifest toxic signs are absent. The physostigmine regimen has excellent antidotal capacity, but the very narrow therapeutic window (< 10\u2009min) makes it unsuitable for use in the field. The HI-6 regimen appears to constitute an efficacious therapy against lower doses of soman (2 and 3 x LD50).", 
    "3": "The benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) a melatonin receptor agonist and a histamine antagonist have all been approved as hypnotics. Beyond their differing mechanisms of action, they have differences in pharmacokinetics, and among the BzRAs differences in receptor subtype affinity and formulations, which provides the physician with broad options for tailoring therapy to each patient's specific needs. Consistent with their specific pharmacokinetics and formulations, these Food and Drug Administration-approved hypnotics have been shown to improve sleep with no evidence of tolerance development in long-term use. In addition, emerging data indicate these drugs also improve aspects of daytime function. Their side effects are either associated with the direct sedating effects of the drugs, doses greater than clinical doses, or a combination with alcohol or other sedating drugs. Anxiolytic BzRAs, sedating antidepressants and antipsychotics have been used off-label as hypnotics. However, in the absence of information regarding their dose range for efficacy and safety, their use as hypnotics is ill-advised.",

There are any reports about the effects of kale ingestion on the chemoprevention function and mechanism, but the interactions between kale and drugs have not been researched. We investigated the effects of kale intake on cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism by using cocktail probe drugs, including midazolam (for CYP3A4), caffeine (for CYP1A2), dextromethorphan (for CYP2D6), tolbutamide (for CYP2C9), omeprazole (for CYP2C19), and chlorzoxazone (for CYP2E1). Cocktail drugs were administered into rats treated with kale and cabbage (2000 mg/kg) for a week. The results showed that kale intake induced a significant increase in plasma levels and the AUC of midazolam, caffeine, and dextromethorphan. In addition, the plasma concentration and AUC of omeprazole tended to increase. Additionally, no almost differences in the mRNA expression levels of CYP enzymes in the liver were observed. In conclusion, kale ingestion was considered to have an inhibitory effect on the activities of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2D6, and 2C19 for a reason competitive inhibition than inhibitory changes in the mRNA expressions.",

    "6": "The intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated in our hospital between March 2008 and August 2011 who had acute pulmonary edema and hyoxemia in NIV failure due to patient refusal to continue the NIV sessions (due to discomfort) were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups by the random numerical table method. They were treated with either midazolam (29 cases) or dexmedetomidine (33 cases). The patients were sedated (Ramsay scale 2-3) by a continuous perfusion of midazolam or dexmedetomidine during the NIV session. Cardiorespiratory and ventilatory parameters, the results of the blood gas analysis, and adverse events were prospectively recorded. The main outcome measure was the percentage of endotracheal intubation during NIV. Secondary endpoints included the duration of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and adverse events.", 
    "7": "In both groups of patients, the expected sedative scores were obtained. The cardiorespiratory symptoms and signs (oxygenation index, pH value, and respiratory rate) were significantly improved in both groups. In the dexmedetomidine-treated group, the patients had a further decreased percentage of failure of NIV requiring endotracheal intubation (ETI) and a more prolonged mean time to ETI (p=0.042, p=0.024). Furthermore, when compared with the group treated with midazolam, the overall duration of mechanical ventilation and the duration of ICU hospitalization in the group treated with dexmedetomidine were markedly decreased, and weaning from mechanical ventilation was easier (p=0.010, p=0.042). Despite the fact that more dexmedetomidine-treated patients developed bradycardia (18.2% vs. 0, p=0.016), no patients required an intervention or interruption of study drug infusion. Conversely, the incidence of respiratory infections and vomiting was lower in the dexmedetomidine-treated patients (p=0.026, p=0.010).", 
    "8": "Dexmedetomidine led to a more desired level of awaking sedation, shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of the ICU stay, and further reduced the prevalence of nosocomial infection for NIV sedation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It appears to provide several advantages and safe control compared with the \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) agonist midazolam.",

The mean age (\u00b1SD) of these offenders was 40\u00b115years and 89% were male. The median BAC was lower (1.30 mg/g) in drivers who had consumed alcohol and used a prescription drug before driving (N=1,251). The mean age of this group of traffic offenders was 38\u00b113years and 85% were male. Both the median BAC (0.97 mg/g) and the mean age were lowest (36\u00b111years, 92% male) in N=3,153 drivers who had consumed alcohol and used illicit drugs before driving. Cannabis, amphetamine, cocaine and morphine (metabolite of heroin) were the commonest illicit drugs identified in blood samples. Sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) were the major prescription drugs co-ingested with alcohol. Poly-drug use was a common finding in these traffic delinquents, although individuals who only drank alcohol had a higher median BAC and were also several years older than drinking drivers combining alcohol with other drugs before driving.",

    "12": "Although there is an abundance of literature on the acute management of enterocutaneous fistulas, there is a paucity of data on the chronic management of enterocutaneous fistulas. Their impact on oral pharmacotherapy, including their effect on the bioavailability of oral medications, is poorly understood. This case describes a 23-year-old quadriplegic male with a complex history of multiple abdominal surgeries presented with three persistent enterocutaneous fistulas. Diazepam and furosemide were among the patient's oral medications and had sufficient bioavailability to show efficacy on anxiety and pedal edema, respectively. Conversely, oral oxycodone and methadone were ineffective in controlling chronic pain despite high doses and aggressive titration. Due to inadequate pain control, the patient supplemented opioid medications with high doses of lorazepam and diazepam to augment psychological comfort. A trial of subcutaneous morphine successfully produced immediate analgesia, causing a marked reduction in benzodiazepine use. Enterocutaneous fistulas may reduce the bioavailability of oral medications to various degrees depending upon the medication. Further research is needed to elucidate the effect chronic enterocutaneous fistulas have on the bioavailability of oral medications. It is therefore important for clinicians to question the bioavailability of medications in the setting of enterocutaneous fistulas and poor clinical response.",

A control group treated with OLZ without AEDs was also included (205/247). Dose-adjusted serum concentrations (C:D ratios) of OLZ and its major metabolites (N-desmethyl, N-oxide, and 10-N-glucuronide) were compared between AED subgroups and controls, using linear mixed model analyses with age, gender, and cigarette smoking as covariates.",

The 10-N-glucuronide concentration was significantly lower in patients comedicated with VPA (-26%, P < 0.001), whereas CBZ significantly lowered N-desmethyl (-42%, P = 0.001) and N-oxide (-52%, P < 0.001) metabolite concentrations. C:D ratios of OLZ and metabolites were not significantly affected by comedication with LTG or any of the other AEDs. All covariates were significant determinants of OLZ C:D ratio, that is, age 60 years or above +35% (P < 0.001), female gender +11% (P < 0.01) and smoking -32% (P < 0.001).",

Computer-assisted personal interviews at baseline and 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups included well-tested measures of substance use and dependence. Changes in substance dependence symptoms and drug use frequencies were calculated using Cohen's d statistic. Mean age was 22; 40% were female; 58% were Hispanic, 17% White, and 21% Black. At 18-month follow-up assessment, participants reported significantly fewer days of cocaine (d = -.85 at 18 months), ecstasy (d = -.93), benzodiazepine (d = -.82), and prescription opioid (d = -.81) use, as well as reduced substance dependence symptoms (d = -.42). These results, together with data from focus groups with completers, suggest that comprehensive health and social risk assessments may have quite strong intervention effects among young adult multidrug users.", 
    "22": "\u00a0\u00a0Ritonavir dramatically increases the bioavailability of a variety of concurrently administered drugs by inhibition of metabolic enzymes and drug transporters. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which ritonavir's inhibition of drug transporters and/or CYP3A contributes to the increased oral bioavailability in mice. The area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) for orally administered saquinavir after coadministration with 50 mg/kg ritonavir dramatically increased (325-fold). As a result, the bioavailability, Fa\u00b7Fg and Fh increased 75-, 38- and twofold, respectively. In addition, the increase in the AUC predicted from the in vitro Ki value was ninefold, which was derived from the inhibition of metabolic enzymes by ritonavir in the liver. The remaining 36-fold increase in the AUC was considered to be derived from the inhibition in the small intestine. The AUCinf for probe substrate midazolam, fexofenadine, and pravastatin increased after the oral administration of ritonavir by only five-, 13-, and sevenfold, respectively. Moreover, the AUC0-12 for saquinavir was affected negligibly by itraconazole. These results indicate ritonavir mainly affects the first-pass effect of saquinavir in the small intestine, increasing the bioavailability of orally administered saquinavir. Furthermore, cyp isoforms other than CYP3A, which contribute to the metabolism of saquinavir in humans, are involved in the metabolism of saquinavir in mice.",

Both private and public prescription drug plans encourage the use of generic drugs through a variety of mechanisms. The magnitude of cost savings for a given generic drug is dependent on the degree to which the generic market is competitive. Should the competitive structure become compromised, higher prices and reduced cost savings may result. An alleged conspiracy between Mylan Laboratories and its active-ingredient suppliers in 1997 was associated with an increase in seller concentration in the generic lorazepam market. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleged that Mylan raised costs to consumers by $120 million because of price increases for generic lorazepam from March through December 1998 and for generic clorazepate from January through December 1998.

Medicaid's excess payments were estimated under 2 different assumptions regarding what the average generic lorazepam price would have been in the absence of the alleged conspiracy. To find counterfactual prices, the average per-claim reimbursement for lorazepam for the 4 quarters prior to the alleged conspiracy, $6.80, was inflated using (a) the quarterly change in the average per-claim reimbursement for generic alprazolam and (b) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, all goods.

The clinical features and genetic findings of PNKD, rarely described in the Asians, were mostly delineated from European families. The present study characterized the clinical and genetic findings of a Taiwanese PNKD family. The clinical features of our five patients in successive three generations included onset age less than 10 years, attack duration between 3 min and 4h, and a variety of aura symptoms. The attacks were provoked not by sudden action but by emotional stress, caffeine, fatigue, heavy exercise and sleep deprivation. Sleep could abolish or diminish the attack and the attacks responded well to clonazepam. Sequencing the whole coding region of PNKD/MR-1 gene identified a heterozygous c.20 C>T (p.Ala7Val) mutation which was clearly segregated in the five affected patients. Comparing our patients with previously reported 18 families with PNKD/MR-1 mutations, the majority of the patients exhibited quite similar manifestations in attack patterns and precipitating factors. The recurrent conservative mutations in different ethnicities indicate importance in the pathogenesis of PNKD.",

The isolation of the selected compounds involved a liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate at a basic pH. Good chromatographic separation was achieved on a HSS T3 column (1.8 \u03bcm particle size), with a 3 min gradient elution using a mixture of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 5mM ammonium acetate (solvent B) as the mobile phase. The tandem mass spectrometric detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with ionization of the analytes in positive mode. The assay was fully validated according to current acceptance criteria for bioanalytical methods validation. It was proved to be linear in the range of 0.5-250 ng/mL, with adequate accuracy and precision over this range. Based on accuracy and CV% values the LOQ and ULOQ values were set at 0.509 ng/mL and 2036 ng/mL for MET, 0.520 ng/mL and 2080 ng/mL for EDDP, 0.524 ng/mL and 2096 ng/mL for FNZ and 0.528 ng/mL and 2114 ng/mL for 7-AFNZ, respectively.

    "60": "Olanzapine is prescribed for a number of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and unipolar and bipolar depression. Olanzapine treatment is associated with tolerability issues such as metabolic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, increase in blood glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol levels), extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS] (e.g. parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) and sedative adverse effects. Metabolic issues lead to some long-term consequences, which include cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and these complications cause high rates of mortality and morbidity among patients with severe mental illnesses. The expanded indications of olanzapine in psychiatry suggest a need to investigate whether there is a difference in the incidence and severity of adverse effects related to category diagnosis. Are the adverse effects expressed differently according to phenotype? Unfortunately, there are no reported studies that investigated these differences in adverse effects associated with olanzapine treatment in psychiatric patients with different phenotypes.",

The secondary outcomes of our study were assessing the incidence of some EPS (parkinsonism, akathisia and use of antiparkinson medication). The tolerability outcomes were calculated separately for the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups and were combined in a meta-analysis. Tolerability outcomes show that olanzapine contributes to weight gain and elevates blood triglycerides, glucose and total cholesterol levels in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. However, olanzapine treatment produced significantly more weight gain in schizophrenia patients than in bipolar disorder patients. In addition, increases in blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in the schizophrenia group compared with the bipolar disorder group, even though these differences were not statistically significant. Based on our results, the incidence of parkinsonism was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group than in the bipolar disorder group. Subgroup analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the influence of treatment duration, dose, industry sponsorship, age and sex ratio on tolerability outcome.",

The findings may be explained by considering the fact that in addition to genetic disposition for metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients, they have an especially high incidence of lifestyle risk factors for CVD, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, stress and smoking. It might be that an antipsychotic induces severity of adverse effect according to the phenotype.",

'First-generation' oral agents such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine are associated with high levels of unwanted neurological effects and poor rates of patient adherence.1,2 Long-acting ('depot') injections of antipsychotics were developed to try to improve adherence. 'Second-generation' antipsychotic agents (also known as atypical antipsychotics) were introduced into clinical practice over 16 years ago. Although these agents have a lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal side effects, they are associated with a range of other unwanted effects (e.g. weight gain and its sequelae).1,3,4 Initially, second-generation agents were only available as orally administered medicines. Three long-acting injectable formulations of second-generation antipsychotics are now available in the UK: olanzapine embonate injection (ZypAdhera), paliperidone injection (Xeplion) and risperidone injection (Risperdal Consta).

Additionally it promotes host cell rupture by cleaving the skeletal proteins of the erythrocyte membrane. Therefore, the inhibition of FP-2 represents a promising target in the search of novel anti-malarial drugs.

In order to study in depth the inhibition mechanism triggered by this interesting compound, we carried out, through ONIOM hybrid calculations, a computational investigation of the processes occurring when the inhibitor targets the enzyme and eventually leads to an irreversible covalent Michael adduct. Each step of the reaction mechanism has been accurately characterized and a detailed description of each possible intermediate and transition state along the pathway has been reported.", 
    "69": "Parasomnias are abnormal behaviors emanating from or associated with sleep. Sleepwalking and related disorders result from an incomplete dissociation of wakefulness from nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Conditions that provoke repeated cortical arousals, or promote sleep inertia lead to NREM parasomnias by impairing normal arousal mechanisms. Changes in the cyclic alternating pattern, a biomarker of arousal instability in NREM sleep, are noted in sleepwalking disorders. Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) is characterized by a disruption of the nocturnal fast with episodes of feeding after an arousal from sleep. SRED is often associated with the use of sedative-hypnotic medications; in particular, the widely prescribed benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Recently, compelling evidence suggests that nocturnal eating may in some cases be a nonmotor manifestation of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). rapid eye movement (REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is characterized by a loss of REM paralysis leading to potentially injurious dream enactment. The loss of atonia in RBD often predates the development of Parkinson's disease and other disorders of synuclein pathology. Parasomnia behaviors are related to an activation (in NREM parasomnias) or a disinhibition (in RBD) of central pattern generators (CPGs). Initial management should focus on decreasing the potential for sleep-related injury followed by treating comorbid sleep disorders. Clonazepam and melatonin appear to be effective therapies in RBD, whereas paroxetine has been reported effective in some cases of sleep terrors. At this point, pharmacotherapy for other parasomnias is less certain, and further investigations are necessary.", 
    "70": "Recent reports have implied that aberrant biochemical processes in the brain frequently accompany subtle shifts in the cellular epigenetic profile that might underlie the pathogenic progression of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, certain antidepressants or mood stabilizers have been reported to have the ability to modulate epigenetic parameters. We previously reported that pretreatment of mice with 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists 24 h before testing suppressed the decrease in emotional behaviors induced by exposure to acute restraint stress. Based on this finding, the aim of the present study was to examine the association between the development of emotional resistance to stress stimuli and the modulation of an epigenetic parameter, particularly histone acetylation. We found that acetylated histone H3 was increased in the hippocampus of mice that had developed resistance to emotional stress by pretreatment with flesinoxan (1 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h before testing. On the other hand, pretreatment with benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) did not have similar effects. Interestingly, similar to flesinoxan, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A also protected against the emotional changes induced by acute restraint stress, as well as histone H3 acetylation. The present findings suggest that the epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation may play an important role in the development of emotional resistance to stress stimuli.", 
    "71": "Neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease, a better correlate of cognitive impairment than amyloid deposition, is currently gauged by the degree of regional atrophy. However, functional markers, such as GABA(A) receptor density, a marker of neuronal integrity, could be more sensitive. In post-mortem hippocampus, GABA(A) messenger RNA expression is reduced even in mild cognitive impairment. We measured whole-brain GABA(A) binding potential in vivo using [(11)C]-flumazenil positron emission tomography and compared GABA(A) binding with metabolic and volumetric measurements. For this purpose, we studied 12 subjects, six patients with early Alzheimer's disease and six healthy controls, with [(11)C]-flumazenil and [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, as well as with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Data were evaluated with both voxel-based parametric methods and volume of interest methods. We found that in early Alzheimer's disease, with voxel-based analysis, [(11)C]-flumazenil binding was decreased in infero-medial temporal cortex, retrosplenial cortex and posterior perisylvian regions. Inter-group differences reached corrected significance when using an arterial input function. Metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and volumetric measurements obtained with magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in regions affected in early Alzheimer's disease, but, unlike with [(11)C]-flumazenil binding and probably due to sample size, the voxel-based findings failed to reach corrected significance in any region of the brain. With volume of interest analysis, hippocampi and posterior cingulate gyrus showed decreased [(11)C]-flumazenil binding. In addition, [(11)C]-flumazenil hippocampal binding correlated with memory performance. Remarkably, [(11)C]-flumazenil binding was decreased precisely in the regions showing the greatest degree of neuronal loss in post-mortem studies of early Alzheimer's disease. From these data, we conclude that [(11)C]-flumazenil binding could be a useful marker of neuronal loss in early Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "72": "Organophosphates are a class of highly toxic chemicals that includes many pesticides and chemical weapons. Exposure to organophosphates, either through accidents or acts of terrorism, poses a significant risk to human health and safety. Existing antidotes, in use for over 50 years, have modest efficacy and undesirable toxicities. Therefore, discovering new organophosphate antidotes is a high priority. Early life stage zebrafish exposed to organophosphates exhibit several phenotypes that parallel the human response to organophosphates, including behavioral deficits, paralysis, and eventual death. Here, we have developed a high-throughput zebrafish screen in a 96-well plate format to find new antidotes that counteract organophosphate-induced lethality. In a pilot screen of 1200 known drugs, we identified 16 compounds that suppress organophosphate toxicity in zebrafish. Several in vitro assays coupled with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling enabled determination of mechanisms of action for several of the antidotes, including reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cholinergic receptor antagonism, and inhibition of bioactivation. Therefore, the in vivo screen is capable of discovering organophosphate antidotes that intervene in distinct pathways. These findings suggest that zebrafish screens might be a broadly applicable approach for discovering compounds that counteract the toxic effects of accidental or malicious poisonous exposures.", 
    "73": "Melatonin has been mainly used for alleviating some disorders related with insomnia and circadian rhythmicity. The use of this hormone has been limited, among others, due to its short half-life and instability. This study reports some behavioural actions of two new melatonin analogues that incorporate a phenyl or a benzoyl group at the nitrogen atom of the melatonin molecule. Although diazepam was about 10 times more potent than either of the melatonin analogues, results show that in general these last display better anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative actions than the original molecule.", 
    "74": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy and several rodent models allow studying the pathophysiology of this disorder. One of the best characterized models of TLE is the pilocarpine model. The model has been widely used in rats, but relatively few studies report data obtained with mice. This triggered the present study to perform a comprehensive characterization of the mouse pilocarpine model. We used male NMRI mice (28-32 g) and first established the dose-response relationship for pilocarpine (250-400 mg/kg; ip) to induce status epilepticus (SE). This enabled to define the optimal dose (300 mg/kg) producing the highest SE response (50%) associated with the best survival rate of the animals (90%). The impact of different durations of SE (0.5-3.0 h) on the time to the onset of the first spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) was recorded during 5-day continuous video monitoring following the SE. Virtually no \"latent\" period was observed as the seizures appeared already within 24-48 h after the pilocarpine-induced SE and 0.5 h duration of the SE was sufficient to trigger SRS. Pharmacokinetics assessment showed that these seizures were not associated with residual pilocarpine exposure as it was cleared from the blood and brain already within 24 h post-injection. Consistent with previous reports from the rat pilocarpine model we observed that the extent of hippocampal reorganization and neuronal loss correlates with the duration of SE. However, the shorter durations of SE (0.5-2.0 h) appeared to produce cell loss restricted mainly to the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Interestingly, we also observed that the number of seizures occurring within 5 days after SE appeared to correlate with the degree of hippocampal damage. Continuous 7-week video-EEG monitoring after the SE revealed that SRS were expressed in a particular pattern of clusters. Taken together, the current study provides an in-depth characterization of the mouse pilocarpine model and confirms several features of the epileptogenesis process previously reported from the rat pilocarpine model. However, the mouse pilocarpine model differs by the rapid onset of seizures and an apparent correlation between their numbers and the degree of histopathological changes. Our findings highlight that the pilocarpine model of TLE in mice is associated with brain pathology akin to different stages of human disease and may provide a valuable tool for the discovery of future antiepileptic drugs with disease-modifying properties.", 
    "75": "Olanzapine is one of the most widely prescribed atypical antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. Besides its well-known side effect on weight gain, it may also impair human parental behavior. In this study, we took a preclinical approach to examine the behavioral effects of olanzapine on rat maternal behavior and investigated the associated neural basis using the c-Fos immunohistochemistry. On postpartum days 6-8, Sprague-Dawley mother rats were given a single injection of sterile water or olanzapine (1.0, 3.0 or 5.0mg/kg, sc). Maternal behavior was tested 2h later, after which rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were collected. Ten brain regions that were either implicated in the action of antipsychotic drugs and/or in the regulation of maternal behavior were examined for c-Fos immunoreactivity. Acute olanzapine treatment dose-dependently disrupted various components of maternal behavior (e.g., pup retrieval, pup licking, nest building, crouching) and increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens shell and core (NAs and NAc), dorsolateral striatum (DLSt), ventral lateral septum (LSv), central amygdala (CeA) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), important brain areas generally implicated in the incentive motivation and reward processing. In contrast, olanzapine treatment did not alter c-Fos in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vBST) and medial amygdala (MeA), the core brain areas directly involved in the mediation of rat maternal behavior. These findings suggest that olanzapine disrupts rat maternal behavior primarily by suppressing incentive motivation and reward processing via its action on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems, other limbic and striatal areas, but not by disrupting the core processes involved in the mediation of maternal behavior in particular.",

General practitioners are responsible for the majority of antidepressant prescriptions in France. Antidepressant treatments decrease the suicide risk in adult patients with a depressive disorder or suicidal behavior. However, antidepressant treatment is not recommended in children or adolescents. Indeed, an increase risk of suicide has been reported in this population in previous studies, especially when antidepressant treatment is started. The treatment of adolescents with major depression or suicidal behaviors must be preferentially conducted by a specialized care team. A clinical evaluation must be done very carefully before the onset of antidepressant treatment. In some specific clinical contexts, antidepressant treatments may be used to decrease levels of impulsiveness and aggressiveness. However, the efficacy of antidepressant treatment on violent behaviors is still not clearly determined by scientific literature owing to lack of studies with a high level of evidence. In a few cases of patients, activation syndromes may appear at the beginning of antidepressant treatments, with akathisia, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia and agitation. These reactions may be risk factors for acting out. Alcohol, cocaine or benzodiazepines when concomitantly consumed with antidepressant treatment may increase the risk for acting out. Whenever benzodiazepines are needed in a patient with a high suicide risk, the dosage used must be enough to avoid desinhibition and to obtain anxiolytic and sedative effects.",

To address this problem, a patient group direction (PGD) for acute behavioural disturbance (lorazepam 0.5-2\u2003mg) and staff training materials were developed. The intention was to replace PRN prescriptions with the PGD in two mental health trusts. One of the potential benefits of this would be the removal of the contribution of PRN to high and combined dose antipsychotic prescriptions. This proposal, however, was met with significant resistance in both trusts and did not replace PRN as a result. A series of interviews and focus groups were conducted with 16 RMNs working in the two trusts, to explore the reasons why the PGD was met with resistance. Senior nurses perceived resistance to be associated with anxieties over increased responsibility for decision making. Junior nurses reported concerns regarding the medicalization of the nursing role, the paperwork associated with the PGD and the training approach used. Future efforts to implement PGDs in mental health settings must carefully consider the methods for engaging effectively with participating organizations, in terms of managing change and completing the necessary groundwork for successful implementation.",

The current study is a randomized, cross-sectional resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study where a single dose of commonly prescribed amounts of either benzodiazepine (oxazepam), L-dopa, or placebo was given to 81 healthy subjects. It was hypothesized that the connectivity in resting-state networks would be altered, and that the strength of connectivity in areas rich in target receptors would be particularly affected. Additionally, based on known anxiolytic mechanisms of benzodiazepines, modulated amygdala (Am) connectivity was predicted. To test this, seed region-based correlational analysis was performed using seven seeds placed in well-characterized resting-state networks, in regions with above-average densities of GABA-A or dopamine receptors and in Am. To alleviate the anatomical bias introduced by the a priori selected seed regions, whole-brain exploratory analysis of regional homogeneity and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was also carried out. Oxazepam increased functional connectivity between midline regions of the default-mode network (DMN) and the prefrontal, parietal, and cerebellar areas, but decreased connectivity between, for example, the Am and temporal cortex. L-dopa mainly decreased connectivity between the Am and bilateral inferior frontal gyri and between midline regions of the DMN. The fALFF analysis revealed that L-dopa decreased low-frequency fluctuations in the cerebellum. It was concluded that the overall effects of single administrations of oxazepam and L-dopa on resting-state connectivity were small both in strength and in spatial extent, and were on par with placebo effects as revealed by comparing the two placebo groups.",

In total, 114 patients without life time exposure to any psychotropic medication were randomized to haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine or ziprasidone. Primary outcome was time to all-cause discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included discontinuation rates and symptom change as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The overall discontinuation rate 64%. At 12 months, the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment was 40.0% for olanzapine, 56.5% for quetiapine, 64.0% for risperidone, 80.0% for ziprasidone and 85.7% for haloperidol. Mean time to antipsychotic discontinuation was higher in patients randomized to second-generation antipsychotics than in those taking haloperidol. Significantly lower discontinuation was noted in patients on olanzapine than on haloperidol, or ziprasidone. Our results suggest that olanzapine might lead to longer treatment continuation in treatment na\u00efve FEP patients than haloperidol and, possibly ziprasidone. Global psychopathology was significantly less reduced by haloperidol than with each individual SGA in this earliest phase of treatment.", 
    "104": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the study of white matter (WM) structure. Literature suggests that WM structure could be altered in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) proportional to the severity of the disease. Heterogeneity of brain imaging methods, of the studied samples, and of drug treatments make localization, nature, and severity of the WM abnormalities unclear. We applied Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) of DTI measures to compare fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial, and radial diffusivity of the WM skeleton in a group of 40 consecutively admitted inpatients affected by severe OCD (18 drug-naive, and 22 with an ongoing drug treatment) and 41 unrelated healthy volunteers from the general population. Data were analyzed accounting for the effects of multiple comparisons, and of age, sex, and education as nuisance covariates. Compared to controls, OCD patients showed a widespread reduction of FA with a concurrent increase of mean and radial diffusivity. In no brain areas patients had higher FA or lower diffusivity values than controls. These differences were observed in drug-treated patients compared to drug-naive patients and healthy controls, which in turn did not differ among themselves in any DTI measure. Reduced FA with increased mean and radial diffusivity suggests significant changes in myelination of WM tracts, without axonal loss. Drug treatments could modify the structure of cell membranes and myelin sheaths by influencing cellular lipogenesis, cholesterol homeostasis, autophagy, oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. Changes of DTI measures in drug-treated OCD patients could reflect pathophysiological underpinnings of OCD, or a yet unexplored part of the mechanism of action of drugs.", 
    "105": "Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is generally considered to be of low toxicity. However, serotonin syndrome, seizures, electrocardiographic abnormalities as well as respiratory failure and death have been described in patients with citalopram overdose. The mechanisms of severe toxicity remain unclear. Our objective was to study the mechanisms of death following high-dose citalopram administration in Sprague Dawley rats. The median lethal dose (MLD) of intraperitoneal (i.p.) citalopram was measured using Dixon & Bruce's up-and-down method at 102 mg/kg. Dose-effect relationships of citalopram-induced clinical features, alterations in arterial blood gas and plethysmography, and disturbances in blood lactate, plasma and platelet serotonin concentrations were studied. Seizures were significantly increased in rats receiving 80% and 120% of citalopram MLD versus controls (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). A significant decrease in body temperature was observed after 90 min in rats treated with doses >60% MLD in comparison to controls (p<0.05). The occurrence of serotonin behavioural syndrome was comparable in all groups. Citalopram administration did not result in significant hypoxemia, hypercapnia and lactate elevation. However, a significant moderate increase in the inspiratory time (p<0.05) accompanied with an expiratory braking was observed. A significant dose-related linear decrease in platelet serotonin and increase in plasma serotonin concentrations were measured (p<0.05). Pre-treatments of rats receiving 120% of citalopram MLD with diazepam (1.77 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (17.1mg/kg) prevented seizures and death, but propranolol pre-treatment was ineffective. Neuroprotection with diazepam and cyproheptadine was not associated with decreased serotonin plasma concentrations. In conclusion, citalopram-induced deaths resulted from seizures in relation to serotonin release, whilst respiratory and metabolic toxicity was mild. Our observations support the role of serotonin-induced neurotoxicity in citalopram overdose and suggest that cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, but not beta-blockers, may have a role in the management of citalopram toxicity.",

Modifiable conditions are of major interest, as a causal treatment of dementia is still unknown. Drugs represent a major reversible contributor to cognitive deficits and delirium which is seen in 12-50% of elderly in-hospital patients. A third of patients with delirium is being attributed to drugs, and age-related multimorbidity and subsequent polypharmacy are dominant risk factors. The anticholinergic mechanism is not sufficient to explain delirant drug side effects. Most prevalent in the induction of delirium are psychotropic drugs, in particular benzodiazepines, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, and typical neuroleptics. In addition, \"peripheral\" drugs such as oxybutynin or fluorquinolones are involved. Rationalization of drug therapy is the clue for the prevention of cognitive impairment and delirium; most causative drugs are contained in negative lists (e.g., Beers list) and should be replaced by positively labelled drugs (e.g., by virtue of the FORTA classification). On top of the treatment of other modifiable causes for delirium (such as dehydration, infections, and fever), the avoidance or at least optimization of psychotropic drug prescriptions are key elements of the prevention of cognitive impairment in the elderly.",

The 6.6% of the drivers found positive to alcohol (>0.05 mg/l in breath), 11% were found positive to any illicit drug, and 2% were positive to one of the medicines analysed. Some drivers were positive in more than one substance. The most common illicit drugs among Spanish drivers were cannabis (7.7%), or cocaine (3.5%), either alone or combined with other substances. The most prevalent medicines were the benzodiazepines (1.6%). As a tendency, higher figures for positive cases were observed among males than in females (being statistically significant the differences for alcohol, cannabis and cocaine). Alcohol and cocaine positive cases were more frequently found among drivers of urban roads. Alcohol positive cases (alone, >0.05 mg/l), were more likely found as age increase (OR=1.02), those driving in urban roads (OR=2.13), and driving at any period than weekdays, while alcohol+drugs cases were more likely found among males (OR=2.819), those driving on urban road (OR=2.17) and driving at night periods. Finding a medicines positive case was more likely as elder the driver was (OR=1.05). There have been differences in the prevalence of positive cases of alcohol, cannabis and cocaine, in relation to the period of the week: in three cases the highest prevalence seen in night time. This study shows the high prevalence of psychoactive substances and alcohol in Spanish drivers, mainly illicit drugs (cannabis). This question requires a response from the authorities and from society, with an integral and multi-disciplinary approach that can heighten the population's awareness of the risks of driving under the influence of certain substances.",

The aim of this study was to explore prescription patterns of SRSO in Swedish real-world data on patients with a diagnosis related to chronic pain (DRCP). Patient-level data were extracted from the national prescriptions register and a regional register with diagnosis codes. The prescription sequences, switches, co-medications, and strengths over time were analyzed for cancer and noncancer patients. Of 840,000 patients with a DRCP, 16,257 initiated treatment with an SRSO in 2007 to 2008. They were 71 years old on average; 60% were female and 34% had cancer. The most common first prescription was oxycodone (54%) followed by fentanyl (19%), buprenorphine (14%), and morphine (13%). 63% refilled their prescription within 6 months, and 12% switched to another SRSO, most commonly fentanyl. After 3 years, 51% of cancer and 27% of noncancer patients still being in contact with health care remained on any SRSO. Of noncancer patients, 35% had a psychiatric co-medication (SSRI or benzodiazepine). In conclusion, fewer patients remain on SRSO in the long-term in clinical practice than reported in previous clinical trials. Oxycodone is the most common first SRSO prescription and one-third of patients get a prescription indicating psychiatric comorbidity. Our interpretation of these findings are that there is need for better treatment options for these patients, and that more effort is needed to improve treatment guidelines and to ascertain that these guidelines are followed.",

The aim of this study was to find differences in the steroid spectrum in patients and controls, and to assess the diagnosis of schizophrenia by building a predictive model based on steroid data. Thirty-nine serum steroids (22 neuroactive steroids and their metabolites and 17 polar conjugates) representing steroid metabolome were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 22 drug-naive (first episode) schizophrenia patients (13 men and 9 women) before and after six-month treatment with atypical antipsychotics. The results were compared to the data from healthy subjects (22 males, 25 females). In summary the following significant differences were found: (1) In both sexes higher levels of pregnenolone sulfate and sulfated 5\u03b1- as well as 5\u03b2-saturated metabolites of C21-steroids in progesterone metabolic pathway were found in patients, pointing to decreased activity of sulfatase. (2) In a few instances decreased levels of the respective 5\u03b1-metabolites of C21 steroids were found in patients. (3) As C19 steroids concern, in both sexes there were considerably lowered levels of 5\u03b2-reduced metabolites in patients. On the other hand, with only a few exceptions, the treatment did not significantly influence most steroid levels. Further, to assess the relationships between schizophrenia status and steroid levels and to build the predictive model of schizophrenia, multivariate regression with reduction of dimensionality (the method of orthogonal projections to latent structures, OPLS) was applied. Irrespective of the small number of patients, use of this model enabled us to state the diagnosis of schizophrenia with almost 100% sensitivity. Our findings suggest that the assessment of steroid levels may become a valid and accurate laboratory test in psychiatry. A limitation of our study is the absence of subjects with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia, so we cannot conclude whether the results are specific for schizophrenia. On the other hand, steroid metabolome model may be used as a diagnostic tool for further studies.",

SE was induced with 20 mg/kg KA (i.p.) and seizures terminated after 2 h with diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p). L-NPA (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered 30 min before KA. Behavioural seizure severity was scored using a modified Racine score and electrographic seizure was recorded using an implantable telemetry device. Neuronal activity, activity-dependent synaptogenesis and reactive gliosis were quantified immunohistochemically, using c-Fos, synaptophysin and microglial and astrocytic markers. L-NPA treatment reduced the severity and duration of convulsive motor seizures, the power of electroencephalogram in the gamma band, and the frequency of epileptiform spikes during SE. It also reduced c-Fos expression in dentate granule cells at 2 h post-KA, and reduced the overall rate of epileptiform spiking (by 2- to 2.5-fold) in the first 7 days after KA administration. Furthermore, treatment with L-NPA suppressed both hippocampal gliosis and activity-dependent synaptogenesis in the outer and middle molecular layers of the dentate gyrus in the early phase of epileptogenesis (72 h post-KA). These results suggest that nNOS facilitates seizure generation during SE and may be important for the neurobiological changes associated with the development of chronic epilepsy, especially in the early stages of epileptogenesis. As such, it might represent a novel target for disease modification in epilepsy.",

    "150": "Vascular dementia (VaD)--secondary to cerebrovascular disease (CVD)--has been traditionally distinguished from Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a purely neurodegenerative form of dementia. However, CVDs such as lacunes and white matter lesions are common in patients with AD, whereas certain pathological changes of AD, including senile plaques and tangles, are observed in elderly patients with VaD. These findings indicate that mixed vascular-degenerative dementia (MD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In the treatment and prevention of dementia, the accurate diagnosis of each individual type of dementia is vital. However, recognizing the distinction between these diseases can be difficult in clinical practice. This article provides an overview of MD, including the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment. In particular, we emphasize that functional brain imaging, including perfusion single photon emission computed tomography and benzodiazepine receptor binding measurement, in combination with morphological imaging (such as magnetic resonance imaging) is useful for distinguishing AD, VaD and MD.

Multiple studies have identified sedatives, especially benzodiazepines, as modifiable risk factors for delirium. Imaging studies examining global brain disorders have demonstrated white matter lesions and brain atrophy to be associated with delirium. Endothelial dysfunction, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and reduced blood flow have also been implicated in cerebral perfusion abnormalities associated with brain dysfunction. The response of the brain to inflammation, including activation of microglia and neuronal apoptosis, leads to synaptic and neurochemical disturbances. Decreased availability of acetylcholine during critical illness leads to decreased counter-regulatory activity in response to inflammatory disease states, likely causing additional injury and further neurotransmitter imbalances. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin excess and their respective amino acid precursors have also been associated with brain dysfunction.",

For this purpose, both DA and LD ethyl ester were linked by carbamate bond to imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine acetamide moieties to yield two DA- and two LD-imidazopyridine derivatives. These compounds were evaluated in vitro to assess their stability, binding affinities and cell membrane transport, and in vivo to assess their bio-availability via microdialysis studies. The two DA derivatives were adequately stable in buffered solution, but underwent cleavage in diluted human serum. By contrast, the LD derivatives were unstable in buffered solution. Receptor binding studies showed that the DA-imidazopyridine carbamates had binding affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in the nanomolar range. Brain microdialysis experiments indicated that intraperitoneal administration of the DA derivatives sustained DA levels in rat striatum over a 4-h period.

A 45-year-old man with no prior psychiatric history, sustained subarachnoid hemorrhage. After initial stabilization for 2 days, he underwent craniotomy and clipping of anterior cerebral communicating artery aneurysm. Treatment was continued with labetalol, nimodipine, and levetiracetam. Beginning postoperative day 4, patient developed episodes of confusion and agitation/aggression. Switching of Levetiracetam to valproate did not show any improvement. Psychiatry team tried to manage him with intense nursing intervention and different medications like olanzapine, valproate, lorazepam, and haloperidol. However, patient continued to be agitated and aggressive. Switching from labetalol to metoprolol resulted in dramatic improvement within 3 days. Discussion. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are often not sufficiently effective in the control of agitation/aggression in patients with traumatic brain injury and similar conditions.

    "178": "Surgery is often needed in patients with concurrent liver disease. The multiple physiological roles of the liver places these patients at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Diseases necessitating surgery like gallstones and hernia are more common in patients with cirrhosis. Assessment of severity of liver dysfunction before surgery is important and the risk benefit of the procedure needs to be carefully assessed. The disease severity may vary from mild transaminase rise to decompensated cirrhosis. Surgery should be avoided if possible in the emergency setting, in the setting of acute and alcoholic hepatitis, in a patient of cirrhosis who is child class C or has a MELD score more than 15 or any patient with significant extrahepatic organ dysfunction. In this subset of patients, all possible means to manage these patients conservatively should be attempted. Modified Child-Pugh scores and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores can predict mortality after surgery fairly reliably including nonhepatic abdominal surgery. Pre-operative optimization would include control of ascites, correction of electrolyte imbalance, improving renal dysfunction, cardiorespiratory assessment, and correction of coagulation. Tests of global hemostasis like thromboelastography and thrombin generation time may be more predictive of the risk of bleeding compared with the conventional tests of coagulation in patients with cirrhosis. Correction of international normalized ratio with fresh frozen plasma does not necessarily mean reduction of bleeding risk and may increase the risk of volume overload and lung injury. International normalized ratio liver may better reflect the coagulation status. Recombinant factor VIIa in patients with cirrhosis needing surgery needs further study. Intra-operatively, safe anesthetic agents like isoflurane and propofol with avoidance of hypotension are advised. In general, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and benzodiazepines should not be used. Intra-abdominal surgery in a patient with cirrhosis becomes more challenging in the presence of ascites, portal hypertension, and hepatomegaly. Uncontrolled hemorrhage due to coagulopathy and portal hypertension, sepsis, renal dysfunction, and worsening of liver failure contribute to the morbidity and mortality in these patients. Steps to reduce ascitic leaks and infections need to be taken. Any patient with cirrhosis undergoing major surgery should be referred to a specialist center with experience in managing liver disease.",

Although there is heterogeneity in the registered indications, all benzodiazepine agonists have almost the same mechanism of action. There are, however, substantial pharmacokinetic differences between individual benzodiazepine agonists. During short-term use of benzodiazepines, the elimination half-life is no measure of duration of action. Benzodiazepine lipophilicity determines the speed of action. If a rapid effect is desired, for instance in acute anxiety or agitation, then regarding oral medication the use of a lipophilic benzodiazepine such as diazepam is a rational choice. An accumulation factor can be used to estimate benzodiazepine accumulation during chronic use. In theory, accumulation does not occur with once-daily dosage of benzodiazepines that have an elimination half-life markedly shorter than 24 h, such as oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam.",

Recently, epidemiological studies revealed an association between NPSR single nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to panic disorders. Here we investigated the effects of NPS in mice subjected to the elevated T maze (ETM), an assay which has been proposed to model anxiety and panic. Diazepam [1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)] elicited clear anxiolytic effects reducing the latency to emerge from the closed to the open (CO) arm without modifying the latencies from the open to the closed (OC) arm. By contrast, chronic fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p., once a day for 21 days) selectively increased OC latency, suggesting a panicolytic-like effect. NPS given intracerebroventricularly at 0.001-1 nmol elicited both anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like effects. However, although the NPS anxiolytic dose-response curve displayed the classical sigmoidal shape, the dose-response curve of the putative panicolytic-like effect was bell shaped with peak effect at 0.01 nmol. The behaviour of wild-type [NPSR(+/+)] and receptor knock out [NPSR(-/-)] mice in the ETM task was superimposable. NPS at 0.01 nmol elicited anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like effects in NPSR(+/+) but not in NPSR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that NPS, via selective activation of the NPSR, promotes both anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like actions in the mouse ETM.",

    "205": "Three different biocompatible polymers were tested and evaluated in order to improve the whole-blood biocompatibility of previously developed C18-polyacrylonitrile (C18-PAN) thin-film solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coating. Among all methods of modification, UV-dried thin PAN-over C18-PAN provided the best results. This coating presented reusable properties and reproducible extraction efficiency for at least 30 direct extractions of diazepam from whole blood [relative standard deviation (RSD) = 12% using external calibration and 4% using isotope dilution calibration]. The amount of absolute recovery for direct immersion analysis and based on the free concentration of diazepam in blood matrix was about 4.8% (desorption efficiency = 98%). The limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the developed solid-phase microextraction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPME-LC-MS/MS) method for direct whole-blood analysis was 0.5 ng/mL. The optimized modification of the coating was then used for an extracted blood spot (EBS) sampling approach, a new sampling method which is introduced to address the limitations of dried blood spot sampling. EBS was evaluated using LC-MS/MS and direct analysis in real time (DART)-MS/MS, where, for a 5 \u03bcL blood spot, LOQs of 0.2 and 1 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, were achieved for extraction of diazepam.",

The GABA-A receptors are primary targets of many clinically useful drugs. In recent years, GABA has been shown to act as an immunomodulatory molecule. We have examined in human, mouse and rat CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells which subunit isoforms of the GABA-A channels are expressed. The channel physiology and drug specificity is dictated by the GABA-A receptor subtype, which in turn is determined by the subunit isoforms that make the channel. There were 5, 8 and 13 different GABA-A subunit isoforms identified in human, mouse and rat CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, respectively. Importantly, the \u03b32 subunit that imposes benzodiazepine sensitivity on the GABA-A receptors, was only detected in the mouse T cells. Immunoblots and immunocytochemistry showed abundant GABA-A channel proteins in the T cells from all three species. GABA-activated whole-cell transient and tonic currents were recorded. The currents were inhibited by picrotoxin, SR95531 and bicuculline, antagonists of GABA-A channels. Clearly, in both humans and rodents T cells, functional GABA-A channels are expressed but the subtypes vary. It is important to bear in mind the interspecies difference when selecting the appropriate animal models to study the physiological role and pharmacological properties of GABA-A channels in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and when selecting drugs aimed at modulating the human T cells function.",

We have recently shown that ODN exerts a protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced oxidative stress in astrocytes. The purpose of the present study was to determine the type of receptor and the transduction pathways involved in the protective effect of ODN in cultured rat astrocytes. We have first observed a protective activity of ODN at very low concentrations that was abrogated by the metabotropic ODN receptor antagonist cyclo(1-8)[DLeu(5)]OP, but not by the CBR antagonist flumazenil. We have also found that the metabotropic ODN receptor is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase in astrocytes and that the glioprotective action of ODN upon H(2)O(2)-induced astrocyte death is PKA- and MEK-dependent, but PLC/PKC-independent. Downstream of PKA, ODN induced ERK phosphorylation, which in turn activated the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and blocked the stimulation by H(2)O(2) of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax. The effect of ODN on the Bax/Bcl-2 balance contributed to abolish the deleterious action of H(2)O(2) on mitochondrial membrane integrity and caspase-3 activation. Finally, the inhibitory effect of ODN on caspase-3 activity was shown to be PKA and MEK-dependent. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that the potent glioprotective action of ODN against oxidative stress involves the metabotropic ODN receptor coupled to the PKA/ERK-kinase pathway to inhibit caspase-3 activation.",

Chronic antipsychotic treatment might contribute to this comorbidity by inducing supersensitivity within the brain's dopamine system. Dopamine supersensitivity can enhance the incentive motivational properties of reward cues, and reward cues contribute to the maintenance and severity of drug addiction. We have shown previously that rats withdrawn from continuous haloperidol (HAL) treatment (via subcutaneous minipump) develop dopamine supersensitivity and pursue reward cues more vigorously than HAL-naive rats following an amphetamine (AMPH) challenge. Atypical antipsychotic drugs are thought to be less likely than typicals to produce dopamine supersensitivity. Thus, we compared the effects of HAL and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (OLZ) on the pursuit of reward cues. Rats were trained to associate a light-tone cue with water then treated with HAL or OLZ. Following antipsychotic withdrawal, we assessed AMPH-induced enhancement of lever pressing for the cue. Withdrawal from HAL, but not from OLZ, enhanced this effect. HAL, but not OLZ, also enhanced AMPH-induced psychomotor activation and c-fos mRNA expression in the caudate-putamen. Thus, prior HAL, but not OLZ, enhanced conditioned reward following an AMPH challenge, and this was potentially linked to enhanced behavioral sensitivity to AMPH and AMPH-induced engagement of the caudate-putamen. These findings suggest that HAL, but not an atypical like OLZ, modifies reward circuitry in ways that increase responsiveness to reward cues. Because enhanced responsiveness to reward cues can promote drug-seeking behavior, it should be investigated whether atypical antipsychotics might be a preferential option in schizophrenic patients at risk for drug abuse or addiction.",

    "213": "For a better understanding of circumstantial and toxicological findings of fatalities resulting from self-administration of intravenous anesthetic/narcotic agents, medico-legal autopsy files of the State Institute of Legal and Social Medicine Berlin from 1998 to 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Of a total of 15,300 autopsies, 9 cases of such deaths were identified, and all were health care professionals. Medical supplies for injection were found still on, or near, the body at the scene. Anesthetic/narcotic agents detected were classified into 3 categories, and administered solely or in combination. Propofol was the most common agent, being detected in 6 cases. In 2 out of 6 cases, propofol was detected substantially above therapeutic levels and was considered the cause of death. In the remaining 4 cases, propofol levels were within the therapeutic range, but propofol intoxication was considered as lethal due to it being administered by rapid continuous injection. In 5 cases, injection of opioid narcotics was fatal. Alongside the 2 propofol-detected cases, there was one case where a higher-than-therapeutic level of piritramide and a therapeutic level of alfentanil was identified. Despite suspected usage, remifentanil was not detected due to its rapid metabolism by elastases in one case, and sufentanil was undetectable due to putrefaction in another, but death was attributed to their potent respiratory depressant effects without respiratory assistance. Benzodiazepines were detected in 4 cases. All of them were used together with propofol or opioids, and contributed to death by inhibiting respiration. It is essential to consider means of administration as well as additive or synergistic effects of combined agents when interpreting toxicological results in such cases."
