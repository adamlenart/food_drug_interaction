    "0": "Midazolam has several advantages over diazepam as a sedative agent in electrophysiologic studies, but its electrophysiologic effects in humans are unknown. Therefore, its effects were studied in 20 patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies. Electrophysiologic variables were measured before and after administration of intravenous midazolam (5 mg). There were no significant changes in the electrophysiologic variables, apart from a minor decrease in sinus cycle length (711 +/- 124 vs 647 +/- 91 ms; p = 0.005). Ease of inducibility of reentrant tachycardia was not significantly altered by midazolam, and tachycardia remained inducible in all patients. The drug was well-tolerated with no significant side effects, apart from a minor reduction (mean 18 mm Hg) in blood pressure (p less than 0.001). Good amnesic effect was achieved in 16 patients, and most patients preferred it to oral diazepam for sedation during the procedure. It is concluded that midazolam can be used safely in patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies without significantly interfering with electrophysiologic variables or the inducibility of reentrant tachycardias.", 
    "1": "To investigate the nature of the muscarinic receptors present on parietal cell membranes, binding studies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of parietal cell messenger (m) RNA were undertaken. Displacement of N-[3H]methylscopolamine by various muscarinic antagonists showed displacement with a single affinity. The apparent dissociation constant values were as follows: atropine (nonselective), 1.95 +/- 0.28 nmol/L; pirenzepine (M1), 169 +/- 24 nmol/L; AF-DX 116 (M2), 1542 +/- 33 nmol/L; and hexahydrosiladifenidol (M3), 29 +/- 3.4 nmol/L. These data confirmed the existence of only an M3 receptor linked to acid secretion as defined pharmacologically. PCR amplification of parietal cell mRNA with primers designed for detection of all known muscarinic receptor subtypes showed that only m3 fragments were produced from parietal cell mRNA, whereas m1 and m2 products could be detected in brain or cardiac mRNA. The m3 nature of the PCR product was confirmed by Southern blotting with 32P-labeled human m3 complementary DNA. Hence the two carbachol affinities and the separable cellular responses following muscarinic activation are caused by separate coupling pathways of the M3 receptor.", 
    "2": "1. Animal studies of the effects of early exposure to CNS agents devoid of a major teratogenic potential must assess possible deviations from normal behavioral development in both a stage-specific and a behavior-specific fashion; several experiments on prenatal benzodiazepine (BDZ) exposure are reviewed, illustrating such an assessment strategy and discussing caveats on experimental designs and statistical analysis. 2. The offspring of mouse dams treated in late pregnancy with oxazepam (15 mg/kg p.o. twice daily on days 12-16) show a mild and reversible impairment in somatic and neurobehavioral development which is unlikely to be responsible for a series of other more specific changes. 3. The treatment produces a selective reduction of locomotor activity and amphetamine hyperactivity at the end of the second postnatal week, as well as a selective impairment of active avoidance at the young adult stage, in the absence of similar changes in scopolamine hyperactivity and passive avoidance. 4. The treatment also prevents the appearance at 28 days of morphine hyperactivity and of rebound hyperactivity after muscimol depression, without modifying the developmental profile of pain reactivity and of morphine and muscimol analgesia. 5. Young adult females previously exposed to oxazepam in utero show a marked enhancement of maternal aggression towards male intruders; mother-pup interactions are also modified, leading either to reduced or to exaggerated maternal care as a function of fostering procedures. 6. Overall, several effects of prenatal BDZ exposure appear to be amenable to modifications in monoaminergic system functions and/or to an accelerated development of GABAergic mechanisms; some of the changes in social and parental interactions, however, point to subtle modifications in the balance between different components of the fear-defensive repertoire, possibly due to an altered stimulus reactivity by mechanisms which are still poorly understood.", 
    "3": "Pancreatic secretion in rats is regulated by feedback inhibition of cholecystokinin (CCK) release by proteases in the gut lumen, but little is known about the role of gastric acid in this regulation. This study, carried out on conscious rats with large gastric fistulas (GF) and pancreatic fistulas, shows that diversion of pancreatic juice results in the progressive stimulation of pancreatic secretion only in rats with the GF closed. When the GF was kept open, the diversion resulted in only small increment in pancreatic secretion and this was accompanied by progressive increase in gastric acid outputs. Similar amounts of HCl instilled into the duodenum in rats with the GF open fully reproduced the increase in pancreatic secretion observed after the diversion of pancreatic juice. Pretreatment with omeprazole (15 mumol/kg) to suppress gastric acid secretion or with L-364,718 (5 mumol/kg) to antagonize CCK receptors in the diverted state, resulted in the decline in pancreatic secretion similar to that observed after opening the GF. CCK given s.c. (20-320 pmol/kg) failed to cause any significant rise in the post-diversion pancreatic secretion in rats with the GF closed, but stimulated this secretion dose-dependently when the GF was open. Camostate (6-200 mg/kg) in rats with pancreatic juice returned to the duodenum caused dose-dependent increase in pancreatic secretion, but after opening the GF or after omeprazole this increase was reduced by about 75%. This study provides evidence that gastric acid plays a crucial role in the pancreatic response to diversion of pancreatic juice or inhibition of luminal proteases, and that factors that eliminate gastric acid secretion reduce this response.", 
    "4": "Fifteen patients with restless legs syndrome underwent whole-night polysomnographic recordings before and during clonazepam treatment. The treatment with 0.5 to 1.5 mg clonazepam improved subjective complaints of all the 15 patients. All the patients presented periodic leg movements on the polysomnograms before the treatment. The clonazepam treatment significantly decreased the total numbers of leg movements and the numbers of leg movements per hour without affecting the mean intermovement interval.", 
    "5": "The most common pharmacological treatments for panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) include the use of imipramine and alprazolam while the most common behavior therapy is the use of graded in vivo exposure. Several studies have found these treatments to be superior to placebo in the treatment of PDA, but it has not been clear if there are differences among these three treatments. It has also not been clear for what aspects of PDA each treatment is the most effective. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the results of relevant treatment outcome studies on a number of dependent variables (e.g., panic attack severity, dysphoria, avoidance behavior). Few studies satisfied the minimum criteria for inclusion and the final data pool consisted of 34 treatment studies. Imipramine was found to be generally ineffective for most variables. Alprazolam was significantly effective for panic and anxiety variables in PDA, while exposure was significantly effective for phobia variables. Exposure had the most consistently strong effect sizes.", 
    "6": "A growing body of literature has documented the differential role of the frontal regions of the two cerebral hemispheres in certain positive and negative affective processes. This corpus of evidence has led to the hypothesis of a possible differential effect of diazepam on asymmetry of frontal activation. To examine this question, nine infant rhesus monkeys were tested on two occasions during which brain electrical activity was recorded from left and right frontal and parietal scalp regions. During one session, recordings were obtained under a baseline restraint condition and then after an injection of diazepam (1 mg/kg). In the other session, following the same baseline restraint condition, a vehicle injection was given. In response to diazepam, the animals showed an asymmetrical decrease in power in the 4-8 Hz frequency band, which was most pronounced in the left frontal region. No change in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was observed in response to vehicle. Asymmetry in parietal EEG activity was also unchanged by diazepam. Diazepam also produced overall reductions in power across different frequency bands in both frontal and parietal regions. Good test-retest stability of EEG measures of activation asymmetry was also found between the two testing sessions separated by three months. The possible proximal cause of the asymmetrical change in frontal brain electrical activity in response to diazepam, as well as the implications of these findings for understanding the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines are discussed.", 
    "7": "Dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibit POMC peptide release from the pituitary intermediate lobe, via interaction with D2 or GABA-A/benzodiazepine receptors. Here, we examined the effects of an antianxiety triazolobenzodiazepine, adinazolam, on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-stimulated POMC peptide secretion from the rat neurointermediate pituitary. Neurointermediate lobes (NILS) were incubated with CRF (10(-7) M), then adinazolam (10(-8) or (10(-9) M) was added, with CRF remaining in the medium. Aliquots were removed at 15-min intervals and frozen for radioimmunoassay of beta-endorphin. Adinazolam alone did not significantly affect secretion as compared to controls or CRF alone. Adinazolam incubated with CRF led to significant inhibition of beta-endorphin secretion, as compared to CRF alone. In addition, adinazolam was as effective as dopamine or the CRF antagonist, alpha-helical CRF, in preventing CRF-induced beta-endorphin release. Adinazolam appears to act directly on the pituitary to suppress hormone release induced by a stress-related hypothalamic peptide.", 
    "8": "Twenty-two subjects (8 males, 14 females, mean age 36 years, range 21-57) with symptoms of diffuse pain or fullness in a lower abdominal quadrant, without repercussions on general health but with chronic anxiety of which the subjects complained or which emerged during confidential conversation with the physicians, were enrolled in our outpatient department for liver and gastroenterologic pathology at the Institute of Internal Medicine and Metabolic Disorders, II Faculty of Medicine, Naples University. After an average 30-day wash-out period, patients were treated with etizolam, a new psychoactive drug for somatized anxiety. Mean dosage and duration of treatment were 1 tablet twice daily for 25 days. Painful symptoms disappeared in 16.3% of patients, decreased in 38.3% and remained stationary in 22.7% and became worse in 22.7%. Number of bowel motions decreased in 14 patients (63.6%, from an average of 2.04 to 1.56). It can therefore be concluded that etizolam treatment was effective in subjects with colon disorders accompanied by chronic anxiety syndrome or that became acute as result of stressful socio-economic or affective situations or personal disappointment.", 
    "9": "Nitrazepam was used in the treatment of resistant myoclonic epilepsy in 38 children. After the occurrence of nitrazepam-associated swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis and related bronchospasm in one patient, we initiated a prospective study of esophageal manometry using a station pull-through technique with a pediatric 4-channel continuous perfusing system. Three more patients were found to have delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation and high-peaked esophageal peristaltic waves. The initial patient developed severe respiratory distress and bronchospasm necessitating ventilatory support while on nitrazepam and improved dramatically with subsequent normal manometric study following nitrazepam discontinuation. Nitrazepam was reintroduced for its anticonvulsant and cognitive benefits and was tolerated at a reduced dosage. We postulate a central nervous system effect of nitrazepam promoting parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia which can cause potentially fatal respiratory distress. Care must be exercised in nitrazepam use and esophageal manometry may be helpful in defining patients at greater risk for sudden death.", 
    "10": "Alternating hemiplegia in childhood (AHC) has clinically characteristic features which are easily defined and recognizable. Laboratory investigations were basically normal although they were extensively examined during and between attacks. There is still much debate about its etiology, particularly its relation to migraine or epilepsy. Clinical characteristics of identified 23 AHC in Japanese were presented, which were obtained from a large Japanese cooperative study in 1988. AHC may prove not to be as rare as has been thought.", 
    "11": "The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether alprazolam pretreatment can increase the analgesic potency of morphine without increasing opioid side-effect intensities. We employed computer-controlled, variable-rate morphine infusions based on each subject's pharmacokinetic profile for morphine derived from a tailoring bolus dose of the drug administered 1 or 2 weeks before the infusion test sessions. On each of 2 test days, we used dental electrical stimulation to determine stimulus intensity that produced consistent reports of strong (but tolerable) pain; this intensity was used for the rest of that session. Then, we measured baseline (no drug) pain intensity reports, pain-related evoked potentials recorded from vertex, and other parameters typically affected by opioids (subjective side effects). We administered alprazolam (1 mg) or placebo (lactose) orally to the subject and then repeated the test battery 30 min later. One hour after the alprazolam or placebo dose, we initiated the tailored morphine infusion to reach target plasma morphine concentration plateaus of 16, 32 and 64 ng/ml (45-min duration each) on both test days. The test battery used during baseline was then repeated at each target concentration plateau. The order of alprazolam versus placebo pretreatments was counterbalanced across subjects and known only to the investigator operating the infusion system. Results suggest that alprazolam at the dose studied did not alter analgesic potency of morphine. However, alprazolam did clearly decrease the intensity of nausea reported by subjects during and after termination of the morphine infusions. Of special interest, alprazolam alone (30 min after oral dosing) decreased evoked potential amplitude consistently without affecting pain intensity reports.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Taurine is hypothesized to exert its inhibitory neuromodulatory effects, in part, by interaction with the GABAA receptor. Although taurine displaces GABA agonist binding to synaptic membranes, its allosteric effects on the benzodiazepine recognition site of the GABAA receptor complex is unsettled. We determined the effects of taurine on [3H]flunitrazepam (Flu) binding to well-washed, frozen-thawed synaptic membranes prepared from rat cortex. Comparative binding studies were conducted at 37 degrees C and on ice (0-4 degrees C). At 37 degrees C taurine increased Flu binding in a concentration dependent way by interaction with a bicuculline sensitive site, similar to GABA. Taurine increased Flu binding by causing a decrease in KD. The maximal effectiveness of taurine on Flu binding could not be increased further by addition of GABA. In contrast, the maximal stimulation of Flu binding by GABA was decreased by addition of taurine to the level attained by taurine alone. These mixed agonist/antagonist effects of taurine are pharmacologically specific and qualify taurine as a partial GABA agonist in this type of allosteric interaction. However, taurine causes opposite effects on Flu binding when measured at 0-4 degrees C: taurine interacts with a bicuculline insensitive site to inhibit Flu binding by increasing the KD. Taurine inhibition of Flu binding is not overcome by increasing concentrations of GABA. Although the mechanism of taurine inhibition of Flu binding at 0-4 degrees C is unclear, it may be an indirect effect of taurine interaction with membrane phospholipids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "A series of 2,5-disubstituted 2,3-dihydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-4(5H)-one 1,1-dioxide derivatives were prepared and evaluated for the antiarrhythmic effect on ouabain-induced arrhythmias in guinea pigs. Most of the synthesized compounds showed the antiarrhythmic activity in this primary screening system. Some of the compounds with 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl, 2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl and 2-oxo-2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethyl moieties on the 5-position of 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-4(5H)-one 1,1-dioxide exhibited a potent antiarrhythmic activity. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds was discussed.", 
    "14": "The pretreatment anxiety level is supposed to be a very important unspecific treatment factor. Main purpose of this study is to test whether the patients' pretreatment anxiety level is a general or a specific predictor of treatment response and whether mildly, moderately, and severely anxious patients can be differentially characterized by other diagnostic and clinical variables. 103 patients (37 males, 66 females; mean +/- sd age 35.6 +/- 9.5 years), a subsample of the Second Phase of the Cross-National Collaborative Panic Study, were included in the present study. A high positive correlation of initial anxiousness with the number of panic attacks at the end of treatment was found, moreover high positive correlations with most other baseline assessments. Initially severely anxious patients are the severest ill patients with the least treatment response, and that in all treatment groups. The pretreatment anxiety level predicts the number of panic attacks as well as the degree of avoidance behavior in both drug groups, whereas it predicts anticipatory anxiety intensity in the placebo group.", 
    "15": "Effect of pirenzepine, famotidine or a combination of both agents on gastric secretion during anesthesia and surgery was evaluated in 42 surgical patients ranged in age from 17 y to 70 y. They underwent orthopedic, ophthalmic, ENT, plastic, oral or non-abdominal surgery under either neuroleptanesthesia or enflurane anesthesia. They received either pirenzepine 10 mg, famotidine 20 mg or the combination of both agents intravenously just before the induction of anesthesia. Volume and acidity of gastric juice were measured during 3 hours after the administration of these agents. A continued decrease in volume and acidity of gastric juice was observed 3 hrs after the administration of the agents both in the pirenzepine group and in the famotidine group. Efficacy of the combination of pirenzepine and famotidine on gastric secretion tended to be more prominent than that of either pirenzepine or famotidine alone.", 
    "16": "Quantitative EEG was assessed in six dogs anaesthetized with 1.8% end-tidal isoflurane concentration and following diazepam (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) administration. Ventilation was controlled to maintain normocapnia. Five dogs were subsequently given the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (0.04 mg/kg i.v.), and quantitative EEG was recorded. One dog received a saline injection following diazepam (as a control) and quantitative EEG was recorded for an additional 2.5 h. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, esophageal temperature, arterial pH and blood gas tensions, end-tidal CO2 tension and end-tidal isoflurane concentration were monitored throughout the study. A 21 lead linked-ear montage was used for recording EEG. Quantitative EEG data were stored on an optical disc for analysis at a later date. Values for absolute power of EEG were determined for theta, delta, alpha, and beta frequencies. Cardiovascular parameters remained stable throughout the study. Diazepam administration was associated with decreased absolute power in all frequencies of EEG at all electrode sites. The duration of diazepam-induced decreased absolute power of EEG was at least 3 h in one dog. Administration of flumazenil antagonized diazepam-induced decreased absolute power of EEG in all frequencies at all electrode sites. We conclude that quantitative EEG provides a relatively non-invasive, objective measure of diazepam- and flumazenil-induced changes in cortical activity during isoflurane anaesthesia.", 
    "17": "1. The effects of a chronic treatment with several quinolone derivatives on on the aminophylline-induced convulsions in the genetically epilepsy-prone rat have been investigated. 2. Two series of experiments have been performed: in the first one animals received the quinolone twice a day for 5 days, then were given aminophylline (80-140 mg.kg-1, i.p.); in the second series of experiments the rats were treated once a day with the quinolone plus 120 mg.kg-1 of aminophylline for 5 days. The changes induced by both treatment protocols on electrocortical activity and on the occurrance of seizures have been evaluated. 3. Enoxacin reduced the dose of aminophylline necessary for the induction of seizures in a higher degree with respect to the other quinolone derivatives. The derivatives which showed minor proconvulsant properties were ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and cinoxacin. The potentiation of seizures induced by quinolones appeared a dose-dependent phenomenon which was more evident when high doses of quinolones were used. 4. The chronic treatment carried out daily with quinolones and aminophylline suggests that additive neurotoxic effects of both classes of drugs may contribute to the increase of severity of seizure scores. 5. The possible role of GABA-benzodiazepine, excitatory amino acid, purinergic mechanisms as well as the role of pharmacokynetic factors are discussed.", 
    "18": "Overflow of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) from guinea-pig isolated tracheae was evoked by electrical field stimulation (3 Hz, 540 pulses). The muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine inhibited the evoked overflow of NA in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 84 nM). Methoctramine, pirenzepine and p-fluoro-hexahydrosiladiphenidol (each 1 microM) shifted the concentration-response curves of oxotremorine to the right with apparent pA2 values of 7.60, 6.74 and 6.18, respectively. It is concluded that sympathetic nerve terminals in the guinea-pig trachea are endowed with inhibitory muscarinic M2 receptors.", 
    "19": "1. The purpose of the present investigations was to determine the influence of increasing age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam in male BN/BiRij rats as an animal model of aging. 2. Midazolam was administered intravenously at a dose of 2.5 mg kg-1 and its pharmacokinetics were determined on the basis of plasma concentrations as measured by high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.). Pharmacodynamics were studied using the midazolam-induced changes in the electro-encephalogram (EEG) as a measure of the pharmacological effect. Results were evaluated on the basis of simultaneous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling. In an attempt to differentiate between the effects of aging and of concurrent disease, an extensive clinical biochemical/pathological examination was conducted in individual rats by an independent pathologist. 3. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam were best characterized on the basis of a two exponential model. In the 4-month-old rats the values of the clearance, volume of distribution and elimination half-life were 104 +/- 13 ml min-1 kg-1 (mean +/- s.e. mean), 3.4 +/- 0.7 l kg-1 and 30 +/- 3 min, respectively. With increasing age, no changes in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam were observed. 4. The pharmacodynamics of midazolam were determined on the basis of the sigmoidal Emax model. In the 4-month-old rats the values of the parameters relative maximum effect, midazolam concentration at half maximum effect and Hill factor were 106 +/- 10%, 50 +/- 6 micrograms l-1 and 1.6 +/- 0.3, respectively. In the group as a whole no significant changes in the pharmacodynamic parameters of midazolam were observed.4. The pharmacodynamics of midazolam were determined on the basis of the sigmoidal Emax model. In the 4-month-old rats the values of the parameters relative maximum effect, midazolam concentration at half maximum effect and Hill factor were 106 +/- 10%, 50 +/-6 lg 1' and 1.6 +/- 0.3, respectively. In the group as a whole no significant changes in the pharmacodynamic parameters of midazolam were observed. However, when diseased animals were excluded from the evaluation, a tendency towards a decrease in the midazolam concentration at half maximum effect to 25 +/- 14 pg 1-1 was observed in the 36-month-old rats.5. These findings suggest, that increasing age is associated with a tendency towards an increased brain sensitivity to midazolam, which is reflected in a parallel shift of the concentration vs. EEG effect relationship towards lower concentrations. However, it appears that factors other than age also contribute to interindividual variability in pharmacodynamics, considering the substantial interindividual variability within certain age groups.", 
    "20": "Forty-eight male rats were administered continuous cocaine, daily cocaine injections (intermittent), continuous amphetamine, or no drug for 5 days. Beginning 45 days after the administration all groups were tested for their responsivity, as measured by automated activity cages, to a low dose of the cholinergic agonist scopolamine. The continuous cocaine group showed decreased sensitivity to this challenge as compared to the other groups. When tested with a low dose of diazepam, the continuous cocaine group showed the greatest response. However, when observed following an injection of cocaine HCl, the intermittent cocaine group showed the greatest behavioral response. These findings support those of previous studies that indicated that the mode of initial cocaine administration is a key factor in the production of persisting changes in behavior and biochemistry.",

Both were admitted unconscious, with ventilatory insufficiency and convulsions. Hepatic dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy were notable complications.", 
    "22": "The haemodynamic response and changes in plasma catecholamine concentrations associated with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were compared during anaesthesia employing three strictly standardised techniques with commonly used drug combinations. Thirty-six patients were investigated consecutively resulting in 12 patients in each of three study groups. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg.kg-1 (group 1), fentanyl 6 micrograms.kg-1 with thiopentone 5 mg.kg-1 (group 2), or midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 with fentanyl 6 micrograms.kg-1 (group 3). Undesirable changes in haemodynamic effects and an elevation of plasma catecholamine concentrations during laryngoscopy and intubation occurred in group 1. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure increased significantly (34% and 23% respectively). Noradrenaline concentration increased by a maximum of 147%. The addition of fentanyl (groups 2 and 3) attenuated the adverse haemodynamic response and elevation of plasma catecholamine concentrations; heart rate and mean arterial pressure did not differ from pre-intubation values and plasma catecholamine concentrations decreased steadily. Substitution of thiopentone by midazolam in combination with fentanyl abolished the adverse haemodynamic response and modified the increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations. 'High-dose' opioid anaesthesia is not necessary to produce optimal conditions during laryngoscopy and intubation.", 
    "23": "It is well-known that many athletes experience some form of precompetition stress that may result in insomnia during the night before their competition. Yet, sleep withdrawal even if only partial, has a negative influence on performance, particularly when the type of exercise requires good psychomotor performance The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the intake of a hypnotic drug would have negative effects on physical performance capacity. The authors have compared the effects of oral temazepam, a medium half-life benzodiazepine vs oral zolpidem, a short half-life non-benzodiazepine drug, vs placebo. A randomized double-blind trial was used to assess endurance, resistance, strength and coordination in 26 athletes. The results did not show any differences between the three groups, neither in physical performance characteristic nor in coordination. It is concluded that as regards the performance capacity, there is no risk for stressed athletes to use sleep inducers the night before their competition.", 
    "24": "Changes in gastric mucus glycoprotein (mucin) isolated from pirenzepine-treated rats with or without ethanol (50%)-induced gastric damage were studied. The prior administration of pirenzepine inhibited significantly and dose-dependently the occurrence of macroscopically observable hemorrhagic lesions induced by treatment with ethanol. The gastric mucosa was separated into the surface mucosa, including the mucus gel layer, and the deeper mucosa by mechanical scraping, and the mucin in each was isolated. In ethanol-treated animals the mucin content of the deep corpus mucosa was significantly reduced to 68% the control value. This reduction was inhibited by pretreatment with pirenzepine. In the surface mucosa mucin content was also reduced to 48% of control value by ethanol treatment, but pirenzepine pretreatment increased mucin content to 235% the control value. Total mucin content in the entire stomach essentially resumed the control level by pretreatment with 100 mg/kg of pirenzepine. A single oral administration of pirenzepine (100 mg/kg) caused no change in total mucin content, but mucin in the deep corpus mucosa selectively and significantly increased to 124% the control. These and the results of carbohydrate analysis of purified mucin indicate that pirenzepine administration possibly accelerates the secretion of accumulated deep corpus mucus, retains this deep mucus on surface mucosal mucus, and protects the gastric mucosa in ethanol-induced gastric damage. This may be related to the antiulcerogenic effects of pirenzepine.", 
    "25": "According to recent reports, the powerful and selective cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist devazepide (also referred to as L-364,718 or MK-329) is without effect on the weight of the pancreas. This has been interpreted to mean that basal and meal-stimulated endogenous CCK does not play a major role in the normal maintenance of the pancreas. In the present study we show that continuous subcutaneous infusion of devazepide effectively and dose-dependently reduced the weight of the pancreas both in normal rats and in hyperCCKemic rats (because of pancreaticobiliary diversion). The maximum reduction of the pancreatic weight was 40%. Maximum or near-maximum effects were seen with a dose of 200 micrograms/kg/h. The DNA content of the pancreas was also reduced. The reduction in weight and DNA content of the pancreas was maximal after 10 days. Provided that devazepide acts solely by inhibiting CCK-A receptors, we can conclude that endogenous CCK plays an important role in both normal and stimulated growth of the rat pancreas.", 
    "26": "The benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 reverses a number of ethanol's effects, including its reinforcing properties as measured through self-administration. The present study examined the effect of this putative ethanol antagonist in a place conditioning design that has been shown to be sensitive to ethanol's rewarding properties in mice. Using an unbiased differential conditioning procedure, DBA/2J mice received, on alternate days, pairings of a distinctive floor stimulus (CS+) with either ethanol (2 g/kg), Ro 15-4513 (3 mg/kg), or a combination of ethanol and Ro 15-4513. On alternate days, a different distinctive floor stimulus (CS-) was paired with vehicle. Under these conditions, ethanol produced a conditioned place preference that was unaffected by Ro 15-4513. Ro 15-4513 alone did not produce either a place preference or aversion. Ro 15-4513 did produce reductions in locomotor activity during conditioning, indicating it was behaviorally active. These results indicate that a dose of Ro 15-4513 that alters general activity does not affect ethanol reward.", 
    "27": "Dominant and subordinate male mice behave differently when exposed to a female, with subordinates showing impairment of their sexual performance in the presence of the male antagonist. In the present study, we investigate whether these rank-related behavioral differences can be modified by an anxiolytic treatment. In a first experiment, diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) improves the performance of subordinate mice toward the female, as shown by the increase of proxemic behavior, anogenital sniffing, and social grooming of the female. Social grooming of the female is the only behavior modified by a higher dose of the anxiolytic drug (0.5 mg/kg). A second experiment, in which dominant and isolated mice are subjected to the same experimental procedure, demonstrates that social behavior of these two classes of males is not affected by the pharmacological treatment. The results are discussed in terms of the advantages of using subordinate males in such a sexual context as a model for the study of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "28": "The effect of administration of diazepam on successive negative contrast in one-way avoidance learning was examined in rats. Contrast was induced by shifting rats from a large reward, 30 s spent in the safe compartment, to a small reward, 1 s spent in the safe compartment. IP administration of 2 mg/kg diazepam eliminated this negative contrast. Moreover, this effect is dose dependent, with doses of 2 and 2.5 mg/kg, but not 0.5 mg/kg, effective in reliably reducing contrast. These results suggest the existence of similar or common underlying mechanisms in both aversive and appetitive contrast effects; they are discussed in light of the current theories of frustrative nonreward and as a mean of studying the behavioral and biological mechanisms of anxiety.", 
    "29": "Previously determined retention data for a series of benzodiazepine (BDZ) derivatives, comprising nine achiral compounds, four single enantiomers, and 18 individual isomers of nine racemates, on a chiral stationary phase based on immobilized human serum albumin (HSA) were analyzed to define quantitative relationships between structure and enantiospecific retention. Structural parametrization of the agents was done by means of hydrophobic fragmental constants and electronic and steric parameters obtained by computational chemistry methods. A structural descriptor was identified, a submolecular measure of polarity about the stereogenic center, that accounted for the stronger electrostatic interactions of the second-eluting enantiomer with the HSA chiral stationary phase. Quantitative structure-enantiospecific retention relationships were derived for both enantiomeric series and for achiral compounds, and structural requirements for binding to HSA were determined. Two types of binding sites were postulated. For BDZs in the P-conformation, binding to HSA involved a hydrophobic region with steric restrictions. For BDZs in the M-conformation, a hydrophobic region was also involved, as well as a cationic region that interacted electrostatically with carbon C(3) of the diazepine system and substituents at that carbon. These differences lead to different binding patterns for BDZ enantiomers and provide a rationalization for the diversified behavior of individual BDZs that was observed in previous displacement studies.", 
    "30": "The displacement of a series of 1,4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) drugs from a chiral stationary phase, based upon human serum albumin, for high performance liquid chromatography was investigated. The different displacement patterns obtained using various mobile phase additives could not be interpreted in terms of binding of the solutes to a single site. The observations were better described by considering the attachment of the BDZs to several loci on the protein. Two main mechanisms of binding were discerned, a nonstereoselective mode, which affected all solutes and seemed to occur at a large number of locations on the protein, and a highly stereoselective mode, which involved only one enantiomer of chiral BDZs and presumably one conformation of certain achiral solutes. The stereoselective binding mode encompassed at least four different sites, each of which displayed slightly different structural requirements. It is suggested that the nomenclature currently used to describe drug binding to human serum albumin may be misleading. Rather than the use of site I or site II, it may be preferable to adopt the terms type I and type II binding, according to the displacement patterns of the compound concerned. This approach would retain the conceptual simplicity of the current notation, while avoiding misleading implications of the exact molecular locus of binding.", 
    "31": "We report a patient in whom intra-arterial injection of oral medication led to the development of fulminating gas gangrene and death, despite the initial clinical symptoms being minor. We believe that prophylactic antibiotics should be administered to patients following intra-arterial injection of oral medication especially if immunocompetence, such as from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is likely.", 
    "32": "Two total intravenous anaesthesia techniques were compared in an open study of 80 ambulatory patients undergoing ENT endoscopic procedures randomly assigned to two groups: Group I midazolam-flumazenil n = 40, Group II propofol n = 40. The mean doses including induction were 0.75 +/- 0.31 mg kg-1 h-1 for midazolam and 171 +/- 64 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for propofol for 46.3 +/- 17.7 min and 50.3 +/- 24.8 min respectively. At the end of the procedure flumazenil 8.1 +/- 1.9 micrograms kg-1 was administered to Group I patients followed by a flumazenil continuous infusion at a minimal arousal rate (MAR) of 0.24 +/- 0.1 micrograms kg-1 min-1, and propofol discontinued in Group II patients. Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were similar in both groups and remained so during the procedure and recovery. In patients with cardiovascular disease, large variations (greater than or equal to 40% of baseline values) occurred more frequently in the propofol group whereas large variations in patients with no cardiovascular disease occurred more frequently in the midazolam group (P less than 0.05). Early recovery was more rapid after midazolam (P less than 0.05) whereas late criteria for recovery (maze and ambulation tests) were met more rapidly after propofol (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that with the midazolam-flumazenil sequence, early recovery is faster and haemodynamic stability better maintained in poor cardiovascular risk patients, whereas with propofol, street-fitness is more rapidly obtained, and haemodynamic stability better maintained in good risk patients.", 
    "33": "The brain uptake index (BUI) method of Oldendorf was used to examine blood-brain barrier (BBB) drug transport in mice, rats, and rabbits; felbamate (FBM) extraction (E) in a single transcapillary passage was 5-20%, and drug uptake in rat brain was not concentration-dependent. Like diazepam, FBM was retained in mouse brain. To ensure that radioactivity measurements reflected the disposition of parent drug and not some metabolite, extracts of mouse brain were prepared for further analysis. No FBM metabolites were detected in brain 5 min after administration: In silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC), a single [14C]FBM peak was detected--Rf = 0.504 (70:30 acetone:hexane). Confirmatory high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separations [30% methanol, 1.3 ml/min, C18 column, ultraviolet (UV) detection 254 nm] indicated a single peak containing greater than 93% of the radioactivity in the FBM fraction (12-min retention time). In a single transit through the liver (a nonbarrier tissue with fenestrated capillaries), FBM E was 82%. The octanol:buffered saline partition coefficient of FBM was (log PFBM =) 0.54 +/- 0.01. Thus, lipid-mediated BBB penetration of FBM is similar to that of phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB). Plasma proteins do not affect FBM entry to the brain: neither human serum, nor bovine or human serum albumin (BSA, HSA), nor human alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) significantly modified BBB FBM extraction. Erythrocyte-borne FBM may also dissociate and gain access to the brain in a single transcapillary passage. Differences between newborn and adult rabbit BBB FBM extraction and between different anesthetic agents are attributable to cerebral blood flow (CBF) rates. The permeability-surface area products (PS = [CBF].[E]) for FBM in rats, rabbits, and mice were 0.09, 0.16 and 0.30 ml/min/g, respectively. Preliminary autoradiographic analyses of frozen brain sections suggest that [14C]FBM distributes relatively uniformly throughout the brain and that minor variations apparently are a function of differing CBF rates.", 
    "34": "Reduction potentials were determined for various anticonvulsants, including progabide, SL 75.102, CGS 9896, pyridazines, zonisamide, 1,2,3-triazoles, and copper complexes. The values generally were in the range of about -0.1 to -0.6 V for the protonated drugs and the metal complexes. Reduction potentials provide information on the feasibility of electron transfer (ET) in vivo. If the value is relatively positive (greater than about -0.6 V), the agent can act catalytically as an electron acceptor from an appropriate cellular donor. A concomitant favorable influence on abnormal neuronal processes associated with epilepsy could occur. We describe ET as a possible mode of action of anticonvulsants as well as some antiepileptic agents with no electrochemical data based on this hypothetical ET approach.", 
    "35": "One hundred fifteen consecutive patients in the Austin Hospital Comprehensive Epilepsy Program (Melbourne, Australia) were surveyed to document the psychosocial and rehabilitation difficulties after temporal lobectomy. During the follow-up period (mean 4 years) 3 patients died, 5 patients were lost to follow-up, and 107 patients with family and friends were interviewed. Eighty-four patients (78%) had been seizure-free for the year preceding the interview; 13 others had seizure reduction greater than 75%. Success in ablation or reduction in seizures correlated with the amount of postoperative gain, but in this series, analysis of work and dependency outcome did not emphasize areas of success. Although improvement in work and financial status, interpersonal relations and sexuality were all recorded, successful patients deemed that most advance had been made in the areas of newly acquired independence, enhanced career potential, and social freedom. Significant postoperative anxiety, especially after left temporal lobectomy, was noted, possibly explained by benzodiazepine antiepileptic drug (AED) discontinuation. Although 1 patient committed suicide, neither depression nor psychosis was common in the rehabilitation period, in contrast to results in previous series. Significant sociodomestic problems emerged from this survey, however: 35% of patients considered successes reported postoperative problems stemming from the necessity to restructure family dynamics; in 6%, this resulted in divorce. Moreover, 20% of patients and relatives reported significant behavioral problems in coping with the seizure-free lifestyle. Finally, the problems of the worsened situation after surgical failure indicated the counterproductive potential of ineffective lobectomy. These results indicate the necessity for a preoperative counseling program to prevent these problems.", 
    "36": "1. Airways derived from different levels of the lung exhibit a difference in the reactivity and sensitivity to agonists. We have evaluated the effect of acetylcholine and cholinergic selective (pirenzepine, gallamine and 4-dipherylacetoxymethyl piperidine [4-DAMP]) and non-selective (atropine) antagonists on bovine proximal and distal smooth muscle preparations. 2. The distal preparations are more sensitive to acetylcholine than proximal bronchi. The relaxant effect of three selective antagonists on the distal and proximal tissues was the same when the results for each drug were compared. 3. Atropine and 4-DAMP were more potent than pirenzepine and gallamine in relaxing both proximal and distal bovine smooth muscle preparations. 4. These data suggest that the muscarinic sites on the smooth muscle of bovine airways are of the M3 subtype.", 
    "37": "Two interviews separated by 12 months (mean) were conducted with a purposive sample of Glaswegian adolescent drug misusers. Across that interval, beginning to use buprenorphine and temazepam were predictable by prior extent of other substance use, especially cannabis and tobacco, and by the Drug Misuse Scale, using selected MMPI items. About 50% of those who had been using either drug prior to first interview did not use at all between first and second interview. For temazepam, this cessation was not predictable, but ceasing to use buprenorphine was more likely the less time subjects had used this drug and if they had never injected. It is concluded that personality and frequent substance use predispose to drug misuse, but that additional factors must lead to dependence.", 
    "38": "We have studied the effect of ketanserin on cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) and cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity in 19 adult patients undergoing lumbar disc operation--10 during midazolam-fentanyl anaesthesia (group A) and nine during isoflurane anaesthesia (group B). Measurements were made in each patient whilst awake, during anaesthesia, during anaesthesia with ketanserin and during anaesthesia with ketanserin and hyperventilation. CBF was measured by the i.v. xenon-133 technique. CMRO2 was calculated as the product of CBF and the cerebral arterio-venous oxygen content difference. In the awake state, CBF was 52 and 51 ml/100 g min-1 and CMRO2 3.8 and 3.5 ml/100 g min-1 in groups A and B, respectively. After induction of anaesthesia, CBF decreased 37% in group A and 22% in group B (P < 0.05); CMRO2 decreased 26% in group A and 51% in group B (P < 0.05). Adding ketanserin did not change CBF or CMRO2 in either group. The carbon dioxide reactivity of the cerebral vessels during anaesthesia with ketanserin was 15.4% kPa-1 in group A and 24% kPa-1 in group B. We concluded that ketanserin, in a clinically recommended dose, administered during midazolam-fentanyl or isoflurane anaesthesia had no effect on global CBF, CMRO2 or the relationship between the two factors. Cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity was preserved.", 
    "39": "We gave either midazolam or propofol for induction of anaesthesia to 140 ASA I or II female patients (18-60 yr). ED50 values were obtained by probit analysis for three clinical end-points: loss of response to command; loss of eyelash reflex; failure to respond to application of an anaesthetic face mask delivering 1% isoflurane. Propofol ED50 values (95% confidence intervals) were 1.25 (0.99-1.48) mg kg-1, 1.61 (1.29-1.94) mg kg-1 and 1.51 (1.20-1.82) mg kg-1, respectively. ED50 values for midazolam were 0.26 (0.20-0.37) mg kg-1, 0.29 (0.23-0.47) mg kg-1 and 0.25 (0.20-0.32) mg kg-1, respectively. An additional 92 similar patients received one of nine dose combinations of midazolam and propofol for induction of anaesthesia, propofol being administered 2 min after midazolam. Success of induction was based on the clinical end-point of loss of response to command. Administration of 25% of the ED50 of midazolam followed by 50% of the ED50 of propofol resulted in loss of response to command in 50% of patients, while 50% of the ED50 of midazolam, followed by 25% of the ED50 of propofol had the same effect. A probit regression model specifying a synergistic interaction between midazolam and propofol fitted the data significantly better than a model specifying no interaction.", 
    "40": "1. The ability of various anxiolytic and potential anxiolytic agents to modify 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release in the frontal cortex of the rat was assessed by the microdialysis technique. 2. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (2.5 mg kg-1, i.p.), the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.32 mg kg-1, s.c.) and the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist buspirone (4.0 mg kg-1, i.p.) maximally reduced extracellular levels of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex by approximately 50-60%, 70-80% and 30-40%, respectively. 3. (R)-zacopride (1.0-100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) dose-dependently reduced extracellular levels of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex (approximately 80% maximal reduction) whereas the other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron (10 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) and (S)-zacopride (10-100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) were ineffective. 4. In contrast to (S)-zacopride (100 nM; administered via the microdialysis probe), (R)-zacopride (1.0-100 nM; administered via the microdialysis probe) induced a concentration-dependent reduction in extracellular levels of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex (approximately 70% maximal reduction). 5. In contrast to ondansetron (100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.), (S)-zacopride (10-100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) dose-dependently reversed the (R)-zacopride (10 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) induced reduction in extracellular levels of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex. The highest dose of (S)-zacopride (100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) completely prevented the (R)-zacopride response.In addition, (S)-zacopride (100 nM; administered via the microdialysis probe) attenuated the inhibitory action of (R)-zacopride (10 nM; administered via the microdialysis probe) on extracellular levels of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex.6. In conclusion, the present study provides further evidence of the ability of diazepam, 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone to reduce the activity of the central 5-hydroxytryptaminergic system in vivo. Furthermore,the results indicate that the ability of (R)-zacopride to reduce the in vivo release of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex does not correlate with its 5-HT3 receptor antagonism. However, the differential affinity of (R)- and (S)-zacopride for a (S)-zacopride-insensitive (R)-zacopride site in rat cerebral cortex mirrors the relative activity of the two zacopride stereoisomers to modify the in vivo release of 5-HT in the frontal cortex of the rat and their ability to release suppressed behaviour in animal models of anxiety.", 
    "41": "Chronic ethanol (alcohol) administration has been associated with alterations in the binding and function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor. To evaluate the mechanism underlying these changes, we measured the steady state levels of the mRNAs for the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 subunits of the GABAA receptor after chronic ethanol administration to rats and ethanol withdrawal for 24 hr. The results indicated that chronic ethanol administration resulted in a 61% decline in the level of the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNAs [3.8 and 4.3 kilobases (kb)] in the cerebral cortex in rats. The levels of the alpha 2 subunit mRNAs (6 and 3 kb) and the alpha 5 subunit mRNA (2.8 kb) were also reduced, by 61, 45, and 51%, respectively, whereas there was no change in the level of the alpha 3 subunit mRNA (3 kb). Furthermore, the ethanol-induced decrease in receptor mRNA levels persisted for 24 hr, after withdrawal of ethanol and returned to control values at 36 hr of withdrawal. alpha 1 mRNA levels in cerebellum also decreased by 28%. The level of the alpha 6 subunit mRNA, which selectively encodes Ro15-4513 binding sites, was found to be increased by approximately 76% in the cerebellum. Also, the photoaffinity labeling studies using [3H]Ro15-4513 indicated an increase in the levels of various protein components of the GABAA receptor, in the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex (e.g., 50- and 55-kDa proteins in the cerebellum and 41- and 50-kDa proteins in the cortex), after chronic ethanol treatment. The increase in alpha 6 mRNA in the cerebellum might be related to the increased labeling of the 55-kDa (approximately 56-kDa) protein and partially responsible for the increased binding, as reported previously by us. Because the alpha 6 subunit is not expressed in cortex, involvement of an as yet unknown subunit in this region cannot be ruled out. The effect of chronic ethanol treatment appears to be specific for GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs, because the same treatment did not alter the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase mRNA or poly(A)+ RNA. In summary, these data indicate that chronic ethanol treatment results in an alteration in the regulation of expression of GABAA receptor subunit-encoding mRNAs, which could be due to alterations in transcription or mRNA stability.", 
    "42": "The fluorescent probes warfarin and dansylsarcosine are known to selectively interact with binding sites I and II, respectively, on human albumin. This paper investigates whether similar binding sites exist on bovine, dog, horse, sheep and rat albumins. Binding sites on albumins were studied by: (1) displacement of warfarin and dansylsarcosine by site I (phenylbutazone) and site II (diazepam) selective ligands; (2) the effects of non-esterified fatty acids (carbon chain lengths: C5-C20) and changes in pH (6-9) on the fluorescence of warfarin and dansylsarcosine; and (3) the ability of site selective ligands to inhibit hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate. For bovine, dog, horse, human and sheep albumins the fluorescence of bound warfarin and dansylsarcosine was selectively decreased by phenylbutazone and diazepam, respectively. For these albumins medium chain fatty acids (C1-C12) reduced the fluorescence of dansylsarcosine (maximum inhibition with C9) whereas long chain acids (C12-C20) enhanced the fluorescence of warfarin (maximum increases with C12). In addition, changes in pH from 6 to 9 increased the fluorescence of warfarin and although site I ligands (warfarin/phenylbutazone) had no pronounced effects on 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis, site II ligands (dansylsarcosine/diazepam) significantly inhibited this reaction. Rat albumin behaved differently from the other albumins studied in that the C12-C20 fatty acids and changes in pH did not enhance the fluorescence of warfarin. Moreover, the differential effects of site I and site II ligands on the fluorescence of warfarin/dansylsarcosine and hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate were less apparent with rat albumin. The results suggest bovine, dog, horse and sheep albumins have binding sites for warfarin and dansylsarcosine with similar properties to sites I and II on human albumin. By contrast, the warfarin binding site and to a lesser degree the dansylsarcosine site, of rat albumin have different characteristics from these sites on the other albumins studied.", 
    "43": "Catecholamine (CA) release from adrenal medulla evoked by muscarinic receptor stimulation has been studied using isolated perfused adrenal gland and cultured chromaffin cells from dogs. Muscarine and oxotremorine (1-100 microM), and bethanechol (0.1-1 mM) dose-dependently stimulated CA release. Muscarine-evoked CA release was antagonized with M1-antagonist, pirenzepine and, to a lesser extent, with atropine; and was reduced either by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or treatment with Ca2+ channel blockers. Muscarine caused an increase of 45Ca uptake and 22Na uptake. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) did not affect muscarine-evoked increase of 22Na uptake and CA release. Under the absence of extracellular Ca2+, muscarine stimulated a 45Ca efflux. Muscarine-induced CA release was attenuated by treating the cells with 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate-HCl (TMB-8) which blocks Ca2+ release from the intracellular store. A phospholipase C inhibitor, neomycin, markedly reduced muscarine-induced CA release but not nicotine- and high K(+)-evoked release. Cinnarizine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, attenuated muscarine-evoked but not caffeine-induced CA release and 45Ca efflux in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Muscarine caused an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. It caused a similar increase, but to a lesser extent, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The increase of [Ca2+]i induced by muscarine without extracellular Ca2+ was reduced by neomycin and cinnarizine. Polymixin B and retinal, which reduced 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced CA release, had little effect on muscarine-induced CA release. Muscarine increased cellular Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, and atropine inhibited this increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Antiparkinsonian drugs used for 117 chronic schizophrenic patients receiving long-term neuroleptic treatment were withdrawn. Seventy-eight (66.7%) of the 117 patients were without akathisia and/or parkinsonism at least for 6 weeks after the antiparkinsonian drug withdrawal. A double-blind study of clonazepam was carried out for 22 patients and clonazepam was effective on 8 patients (100%) with akathisia and on 3 patients (75%) with parkinsonism. The authors conclude that these data support the need for discontinuous use of antiparkinsonian medication during the long-term neuroleptic therapy of chronic schizophrenic patients and the effectiveness of clonazepam in managing antiparkinsonian drug withdrawal-induced akathisia and parkinsonism.", 
    "45": "Ipsapirone (1.25-10 mg kg-1), a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug with high affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors, increased dose-dependently the number of punished licks in the drinking conflict test (Vogel test) in rats. The anticonflict effect of the drug administered at a dose of 5 mg kg-1 was not modified in animals with lesions of 5-HT neurones, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, 2 x 10 mg kg-1). The anticonflict effect of ipsapirone in PCA-pretreated rats was antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimmido)]butylpiperazine hydrobromide; 0.5-1 mg kg-1), but not by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (0.5 mg kg-1). Neither NAN-190 nor prazosin affected the punished response in PCA-pretreated rats. The present results indicate that the anticonflict effect of ipsapirone depends on stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.",

Esterases in S9 were enantioselective in hydrolyzing either S-OXA or R-OXA, depending on a particular subcellular preparation. Cytosolic and microsomal esterases had opposite enantioselectivity and selectively hydrolyzed S-OXA and R-OXA, respectively. Enantioselectivity of esterases solubilized from microsomes with Triton X-100 (0.1%, w/v) was identical to that of the membrane-bound microsomal esterases. Cytosolic esterases were more sensitive to temperature than either solubilized or membrane-bound microsomal esterases. In the presence of paraoxon (1 microM), the esterases selective toward R-OXA in both microsomes and S9 were completely inhibited, whereas the esterases selective toward S-OXA in cytosol were inhibited by approximately 6%. These results indicate that cytosolic and microsomal esterases in rat small intestinal mucosa are distinctly different enzymes, with opposite enantioselectivity in the hydrolysis of rac-OXA.",

A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the epidemiology of poisoning in children based on admissions to six of Zimbabwe's main urban hospitals over a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989 inclusive. 2. A total of 2873 cases were children aged between 0-15 years. This constituted 47.8% of poisoning cases from all age groups (6018) recorded during the study period. 3. All of the children (0-15 years) had signs and symptoms of poisoning on admission and, depending on their severity, were admitted to a ward or to an intensive care unit. A total of 4.9% (141) died. Most of those who died were suicide cases among the 11-15 year age group and accidental poisonings among the 0-15 year old group. 4. The under 0-5 age group constituted the majority of cases (75.4%) in the 0-15 age group, and most were between 1 and 3 years old.

    "48": "The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil is a very valuable tool in the diagnosis and treatment of intoxications in which benzodiazepines are involved. In case of a positive response, patients will regain consciousness immediately, thus verifying the diagnosis and making a brief history possible to identify other drugs that might be involved. Moreover, invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures like gastric lavage, lumbar puncture, mechanical ventilation, etc., may then be unnecessary. In cases of pure benzodiazepine overdose a single injection of flumazenil 0.2mg should be given, followed by individually titrated increments of 0.1 mg/min until the patient is awake and responsive. In these cases a total dose of 2mg is usually sufficient. Higher doses of flumazenil may be necessary in cases of combined drug overdose. Because of its high therapeutic index, the administration of flumazenil is usually not accompanied by serious adverse effects. Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes characterised by transient anxiety and depression can occur, but the incidence is low. Increases of blood pressure and heart rate due to a release of catecholamines are possible, which might endanger patients with cardiovascular diseases. In severe cases, seizures have been observed which usually respond well to small doses of benzodiazepine agonists. In all cases of successful treatment it should be remembered that the effect of flumazenil deteriorates after 1 to 2h, which usually leads at first to resedation. In these patients additional bolus injections or a continuous infusion (0.1 to 0.5 mg/h) may be necessary. The effectiveness of flumazenil in cases of alcohol (ethanol) poisoning is questionable and should be further investigated.", 
    "49": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether selective antagonism of type \"A\" cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors blocks inhibition of gastric acid secretion produced by CCK and whether this inhibition is mediated through either a somatostatin-dependent pathway or a vago-vagal reflex. Intravenous infusion of CCK (0.04-10 nmol.kg-1.h-1) dose dependently inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in urethan-anesthetized rats, with a 50% inhibitory dose of 0.9 nmol.kg-1.h-1 and a maximum inhibition of approximately 50%. Blockade of type A CCK receptors using the selective type A receptor antagonist MK-329 completely reversed the inhibitory effect produced by a maximal dose (4 nmol.kg-1.h-1) of CCK. Immunoneutralization of endogenous somatostatin by administration of somatostatin monoclonal antibody abolished the inhibition produced by CCK. Concentrations of somatostatin in portal venous plasma were significantly increased after CCK administration; the increase in somatostatin was blocked by pretreatment with MK-329. In contrast, CCK-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion was unaltered after perivagal capsaicin treatment. These results indicate that CCK inhibits gastric acid secretion in rats by activation of type A CCK receptors and through release of endogenous somatostatin.", 
    "50": "In an attempt to evaluate an alternative drug treatment to benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorders, a placebo controlled trial was carried out with a new beta-adrenergic blocker (CPG 361 A). A low-dosage neuroleptic (flupenthixol) was included as a reference drug. Depending on the clinical assessment scales the placebo treatment resulted in moderate to excellent improvement in 36% to 56% of the patients after four weeks of treatment. The active drugs generally had a higher improvement range (from 31% to 80%). The global improvement scale was found to be better than the other scales in discriminating between placebo (50% improvement) and the active drugs (CGP 361 A brought about 78% improvement and flupenthixol brought about 80% improvement). However, only for flupenthixol was the difference of statistical significance.", 
    "51": "Rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus properties of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate acid methyl amide (FG 7142) (5.0 mg/kg) or the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist 17 alpha-hydroxyyohimban-16 alpha-carboxylic acid methyl ester (yohimbine) (3.0 mg/kg) from vehicle in a two-lever, food-motivated operant task. These compounds have in common a beta-carboline structure and anxiogenic behavioral profiles. The yohimbine discriminative stimulus was mimicked by the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist idazoxan and antagonized by the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine, indicating that the yohimbine stimulus was mediated through the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. The anxiogenic beta-carbolines FG 7142, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC), and norharmane, the anxiogenic/convulsant agent pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), and two physiological stressors failed to mimic the yohimbine discriminative stimulus. In contrast, both yohimbine and idazoxan dose responsively mimicked the anxiogenic FG 7142 stimulus. The present results demonstrate that an asymmetrical generalization exists between the discriminative stimuli produced by yohimbine and FG 7142. Furthermore, these data suggest that yohimbine can produce a multicomponent discriminative stimulus, part of which may be anxiogenic in nature. The ability of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists to mimic the FG 7142 cue suggests that activation of the noradrenergic system may underlie cues produced by benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists.",

This orally active compound is a representative of a quinolizinone structure class and shows potent anticonflict activity in mice and rats. It protects rodents from convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazol, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and maximal electroshock, as well as against audiogenic seizures, with an efficacy comparable to that of the full agonist alprazolam. No appreciable sedative or motor-impairing effects could be detected up to a very high dose (100 mg/kg) in the horizontal wire test or the rotarod performance test in mice and rats and in spontaneous behavior in monkeys. Consistent with its characterization as a partial agonist, Ro 19-8022 antagonized the motor impairment induced by the full agonists diazepam or meclonazepam measured in horizontal wire and rotarod tests in rodents, and reduced flunitrazepam-induced effects in squirrel monkeys, with an efficacy comparable to that of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. After subchronic administration of Ro 19-8022 to mice, antagonist-precipitated withdrawal syndrome was dramatically weaker than after alprazolam treatment, which is indicative of a lower physical dependence liability of Ro 19-8022. Pharmacodynamic effects recorded in convulsion and reversal of motor impairment tests after i.v. administration suggest a long duration of action of this compound. Taken together, such preclinical data suggest that benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists with a neurological and behavioral profile such as that of Ro 19-8022 may offer an innovative therapeutic approach to the treatment of anxiety disorders.", 
    "54": "Sleep disorders are especially common among elderly patients and may be the result of psychiatric illness, a medical problem, poor sleep habits, or a primary sleep disorder. Because a sleep complaint (especially insomnia) is only a symptom, the physician must undertake a careful evaluation in an attempt to identify a specific treatable cause. Although some patients may require referral to a psychiatrist or sleep disorders clinic, many patients may benefit from behavioral strategies, such as improved sleep hygiene. In general, hypnotics should be prescribed for only a limited period of time and should be combined with other therapeutic approaches in patients with chronic insomnia.", 
    "55": "A large number of benzodiazepines have been studied for use as sedatives and for their anxiolytic potential as premedicants for outpatient surgery. Potent, new, orally-administered drugs with short half-lives, rapid onset, and minimal residual effects have been developed. Dose-dependent amnesia is also produced by some of these agents. Advances in understanding receptor physiology have shed light on specific pharmacologic activities and aided the discovery of benzodiazepine antagonists with antidote properties. While these drugs have relatively low toxicity, dose-related oversedation remains a risk in susceptible patients, especially when combined with other sedatives.", 
    "56": "1. Social phobia is one of the anxiety disorders that until recently, had not been thoroughly investigated. 2. Social phobia is a relatively common anxiety disorder that appears to have a genetic basis. 3. There are certain physiological aspects of social phobia that separate it from the other anxiety disorders. 4. Support for a dopaminergic abnormality related to social phobia is supported by investigation studies and pharmacotherapy. 5. There are a number of studies reporting success in the treatment of social phobia with medications.", 
    "57": "Tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines (BZ) may be mediated by changes in benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs). Peripheral BZRs (in brain and platelets) and central BZRs (in brain) were measured in rats following intraperitoneal administration of diazepam and clobazam each for 4 and 12 days. BZRs were measured by binding assays using [3H] PK 11195 (peripheral) and [3H] flunitrazepam (central) as radioligands. Diazepam, but not clobazam, increased peripheral BZR numbers in platelets (both P < 0.005), but not in brain, after 4 and 12 days' treatment compared with appropriate controls. Neither drug altered central BZR affinities or numbers in rat brain. BZ effects on peripheral BZRs in platelets cannot be extrapolated to predict changes in brain receptors, either peripheral or central.", 
    "58": "The effects of bilateral intraamygdala microinjection of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor (BZD-R) antagonist, on the exploratory activity in an elevated plus maze were examined in chronically implanted rats. This compound induced a significant decrease in the time spent in the open arms, which is consistent with an anxiogenic action. No effect was observed after intrastriatal injections of flumazenil. Naive rats exposed to the elevated plus maze showed a rapid and selective decline in the content of BZD-like molecules in amygdala (-68%) but not in striatum and hippocampus. These data suggest that the anxiogenic effects of the intraamygdala injection of flumazenil is probably due to the blockade of BZD-like molecules released during the performance.", 
    "59": "Effects of corazol (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ) on the GABAA receptor-channel complex mediated 36Cl- influx into synaptoneurosomes isolated from rat cerebral cortex, were studied. PTZ inhibited the 36Cl- influx stimulated by a GABA agonist, muscimol, concentration-dependently with an IC50 of 2.11 +/- 0.25 mM. In addition, the rate of muscimol-dependent desensitization of the GABAA receptor-channel complex was significantly reduced in the presence of PTZ. Apparently, the superimposition of these two mutually opposing effects is the cause of a mixed (competitive/noncompetitive) type of inhibition displayed by PTZ. The rate of desensitization of GABAA receptor-channel complex is suggested to be regulated by intracellular concentration of Cl- through a feed-back mechanism.", 
    "60": "Effect of compounds related to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex on gastric acid secretion was studied to clarify a role of endogenous GABA in controlling the basal secretory activity in pylorus-ligated rats. When pentobarbital, a GABAA stimulant, was given to pylorus-ligated rats after recovery from ether anesthesia, the drug did not modify gastric acid secretion. In contrast, pentobarbital significantly stimulated acid secretion in rats anesthetized with urethane. The basal acid secretion was much higher in the rats without urethane anesthesia. Diazepam, an agonist of the benzodiazepine (BZP) receptor, did not change gastric acid secretion in both the animal groups. Picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and bicuculline, which block GABAergic mediation, significantly reduced gastric acid secretion in rats without urethane anesthesia. Moreover, the inhibition by picrotoxin was reversed completely by pentobarbital and moderately by diazepam, while the inhibition by PTZ was partly reversed by pentobarbital but not affected by diazepam. These findings suggest that the central GABAA receptor complex may play a significant role in controlling the basal gastric secretory activity. The direct involvement of the BZP receptor may be small, if any. The stimulatory mechanism through the mediation of GABAA receptor complex appears to be demonstrable when the basal secretory activity is lowered.", 
    "61": "Previous studies demonstrated that the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) regulates steroid biosynthesis. In this study we investigate further PBR action by examining its subcellular localization in mouse adrenal gland using anti-peptide PBR antiserum and employing biotin-streptavidin peroxidase immunocytochemistry. Results demonstrated PBR immunostaining exclusively in the cortex. Within this region, however, PBR staining was homogeneously distributed in cells of the zona glomerulosa, whereas in cells of the zona fasciculata both cytoplasmic and prominent plasma membrane immunostaining was evident. Next, PBR distribution was examined using confocal microscopy. Confocal optical sections were obtained, 3-D reconstructions of these sections generated, and vertical, z-sections of the 3-D reconstruction recreated. The immunostaining pattern observed was consistent with a cell surface distribution of PBR. The demonstration of a subset of PBR at the plasma membrane may account for actions of PBR ligands not related to mitochondrial function.", 
    "62": "In vitro binding of [3H]PK-11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1- methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide) in rodent AA ascites and C6 glioma as well as in human gliomas was investigated. The Bmax (mean +/- S.D.) of AA ascites tumor and C6 glioma is 1.39 +/- 0.15 pmol/mg tissue and 4.50 +/- 0.76 pmol/mg tissue, respectively. This Bmax is 9 and 30 times, respectively, higher than the one found in the rat cortex (0.15 +/- 0.03 pmol/mg tissue). A Bmax of 1.26 +/- 0.24 pmol/mg tissue and 0.64 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg tissue was found in human malignant and low grade gliomas respectively. This Bmax value should be compared to 0.35 +/- 0.04 pmol/mg tissue found in the normal human cortex. There are significant (P less than 0.05) differences between Bmax in tumors and normal cortex. There was no significant difference in KD between the malignant and low grade gliomas. C6 glioma has a KD significantly greater than rat cortex. In some cases of human low grade gliomas, kinetic measurements suggested the presence of two affinity receptor sites. However, at this time, heterogeneity of the tissue cannot be excluded as being at least in part a source of this.", 
    "63": "In a prospective study of 169 tenants of senior citizen housing in New Jersey in 1986-1987, the relations between tests of peripheral sensory and motor functions in the lower extremities and the rate of first falls were evaluated. The mean age of the cohort was 79.8 years. Fifty-seven persons fell at least once during the follow-up period (mean, 5.6 months). After adjustment for history of stroke, heart failure, emphysema, and use of a walker or cane, rate ratios for first falls were elevated in subjects with reduced toe joint position sense (rate ratio (RR) = 2.2) and sharp-dull discrimination (RR = 2.0), but to a lesser extent for reduced ankle strength (RR = 1.5). Presence of one or more of these three deficits was defined as a peripheral neuromuscular dysfunction and was associated with first falls after adjustment for multiple covariates (RR = 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.5). Having two or all three sensory or motor deficits increased the rate of falling 3.9 times (95% confidence interval 2.1-7.0) compared with persons without these deficits. These data suggest that impaired sensory and motor function of the lower extremities plays an important role in falls in the elderly.", 
    "64": "The regional, cellular and subcellular distribution of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors was investigated by light and electron microscopy in the rat substantia nigra. The regional distribution and density of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor subtypes (Type I and II) was studied using quantitative receptor autoradiography following in vitro labelling of cryostat sections with tritiated ligands. This was followed by a detailed study of the cellular and subcellular distribution and localization of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors by light and electron microscopy using immunohistochemical techniques with a monoclonal antibody (bd-17) to the beta 2,3 subunits of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Finally, in situ hybridization histochemistry using 35S-labelled oligonucleotide probes was used to demonstrate the cellular distribution of mRNA for the alpha 1 and alpha 2 GABAA receptor subunits in the substantia nigra. The results of the autoradiographic and immunohistochemical studies showed a close correspondence in the regional distribution of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors in the substantia nigra. A moderate-to-high density of receptors was present throughout the full extent of the substantia nigra pars reticulata with a very low density of receptors in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Quantitative autoradiographic studies showed that: (i) the pars reticulata contained mainly central Type I receptors; (ii) the highest density of receptors was present in the caudal pars reticulata (200 +/- 38 fmol/mg) with successively lower densities of receptors in the middle (176 +/- 31 fmol/mg) and rostral (150 +/- 26 fmol/mg) levels of the pars reticulata; and (iii) the density of receptors in the pars reticulata was reduced by 34% following 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration of dopaminergic pars compacta neurons. At the cellular level, GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor immunoreactivity was localized in a punctate fashion on dendrites and neuronal cell bodies in the pars reticulata. At the subcellular level, GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor immunoreactivity was associated with the pre- and postsynaptic membranes of axodendritic synaptic complexes along the length of small-to-large sized smooth dendrites in the pars reticulata. Two types of immunoreactive axodendritic synaptic complexes were identified: most (about 80%) immunopositive synapses showed equal staining of the pre- and postsynaptic membranes and were associated with small (less than 1.0 micron) axon terminals containing few mitochondria and small, round-to-pleomorphic vesicles in synaptic contact with small, peripheral dendrites; less frequently (about 20%) immunopositive synapses showed a marked immunoreactive thickening of the postsynaptic membrane and were associated with large (greater than 1.0 micron) axon terminals containing numerous mitochondria and mainly pleomorphic vesicles in synaptic contact with large mainstem dendrites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The effects of spermine, spermidine and putrescine on the binding of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex were examined in the hippocampus and frontal cortex membranes of the rat. The results demonstrated modulatory effects of polyamines on the binding of diazepam and flunitrazepam but not on that of GABA, muscimol and Ro 15-1788. When membranes were prepared without detergent, the polyamines enhanced the binding of diazepam. However, while the binding capacity increased after homogenization in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, the polyamines did not enhance the binding but inhibited the binding of diazepam and flunitrazepam at greater concentrations. Considered together with other studies, the present findings indicate that polyamines can modulate the binding characteristics of several different neurotransmitter receptor-ionophore complexes.", 
    "66": "The effect of selective protein modifying reagents was examined on benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in synaptosomal membrane preparations of rat whole brain and cerebellum. The potency of diethyl pyrocarbonate, a histidine modifying reagent, to inactivate BZ receptor binding, correlated with the rank order of agonist-inverse agonist efficacies of BZ ligands, the binding of the partial inverse agonist [3H]Ro 15-4513 was inactivated least. Diethyl pyrocarbonate slightly enhanced the displacing potency of Ro 15-4513 and enhanced its binding in low concentrations (1-2 mM). Diazepam-sensitive and -insensitive components of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding were separated in cerebellum. Diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivated the diazepam-sensitive component with a potency (IC50 = 1.8 mM) similar to that on the binding of other benzodiazepines, while the diazepam-insensitive component was resistant to diethyl pyrocarbonate. Tetranitromethane and 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl), reagents specific for tyrosine and arginine residues respectively, exerted concentration-dependent partial inactivation of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding. The diazepam-insensitive component of cerebellar Ro 15-4513 binding was more sensitive to inactivation by diacetyl but less sensitive to inactivation by tetranitromethane. These findings are consistent with a distinctive role of histidine-101 in alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 and alpha 5 subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex and the His is replaced by an arginine residue in the alpha 6 subunit of the diazepam-insensitive cerebellar benzodiazepine receptors. The only other point of the protein sequence where histidine residues conserved in alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 and alpha 5 subunits are replaced in alpha 6 is tyrosine-214 but this residue does not appear to contribute to benzodiazepine binding.", 
    "67": "1. The present study investigated biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioural properties of the novel cognition enhancer, MDL 26,479 (5-(3-fluorophenyl)-2,4-dimethyl-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione). 2. The 5-aryl-1,2,4-triazole, MDL 26,479, potently (0.22 +/- 0.05 mg kg-1) inhibited [3H]-flumazenil (Ro15-1788) binding in mouse cortex but was ineffective in vitro at displacing radioligand binding to the GABAA receptor complex. 3. Parenteral administration of MDL 26,479 (1 mg kg-1) or the benzodiazepine (BZD) inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (0.3 mg kg-1) increased cortical ex vivo binding of [3H]-hemicholinium-3 ([3H]-HC-3), a marker for cholinergic activation. This effect of MDL 26,479 was blocked by pretreatment with the antagonist flumazenil (1 mg kg-1). 4. MDL 26,479 (20 microM) and DMCM (1 microM) increased excitation in the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) slice preparation; however, unlike DMCM, the effect of MDL 26,479 was not blocked by flumazenil. 5. In behavioural studies, MDL 26,479 did not exhibit adverse properties characteristic of drugs associated with the GABAA receptor complex. It lacked convulsant, anxiogenic, anxiolytic, or depressant effects. Since MDL 26,479 lacks activity with the BZD receptor in vitro we suggest that it acts via the GABAA receptor complex at another site on this receptor or in an as yet undefined manner or an active metabolite is formed in vivo. 6. Previous work showed that MDL 26,479 enhances learning acquisition in animal models.The present study suggests that at least some of the cognition enhancing properties are due to the enhancement of cortical and hippocampal cholinergic function and LTP.", 
    "68": "1. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the influence of increasing age on the pharmacokinetics and the time course of the anticonvulsant response of oxazepam in BN/BiRij rats as an animal model of aging. 2. Oxazepam was administered intravenously in a dose of 12 mg kg-1 body weight and the anticonvulsant effect intensity was measured as elevation above baseline of a threshold for induction of localized seizure activity (TLS). Direct cortical stimulation with ramp shaped electrical pulse trains of increasing intensity was used to determine this threshold. 3. The pharmacological effect vs. time profile showed in young rats an anticonvulsant component followed by proconvulsant component which is suggestive for the occurrence of acute tolerance and/or withdrawal syndrome. With increasing age the proconvulsant component disappeared, resulting in a monophasic effect profile (anticonvulsant effect only) at the age of 35 months with significantly higher anticonvulsant effect intensity immediately following drug administration. No age-related changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of oxazepam were observed. 4. In five animals of each age group, benzodiazepine receptor binding characteristics were determined in vitro with [3H]-flunitrazepam as a ligand. Both receptor density and affinity did not show age-related changes. Available literature data on post-receptor events do not indicate conclusive age-related changes. 5. It is concluded, that the observed change in the pharmacodynamics of anticonvulsant effect of oxazepam can be explained by the disappearance of the tolerance/withdrawal phenomenon. This is compatible with a decreased efficiency of homeostatic control mechanisms in the elderly.", 
    "69": "Mice submitted to surgical stress induced by laparotomy and treated with chronic midazolam (1 mg/kg) showed a reduction in stress-induced suppression of thymus and spleen cellularity and in peripheral lymphocyte population. The blastogenic response of spleen lymphoid cells was also assessed and midazolam was found to partially attenuate the suppressive effect of surgery.", 
    "70": "The 2 aryl-3-indoleacetamides (FGIN-1) are a new class of compounds that potently (nM) and selectively bind to glial mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptors (MDR), previously called peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, and increase mitochondrial steroidogenesis. The high-affinity binding of FGIN-1 to MDR derivatives depends on the following chemical characteristics: 1) the dialkylation of the amide; 2) the chain length of this alkyl substitution; and 3) the halogenation of aryl groups appended to the indole nucleus. FGIN-1 derivatives do not bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA), GABAB, glycine, glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, opiate, cholecystokinin, beta adrenergic, cannabinoid or sigma receptors. FGIN-1-27 [N, N-di-n-hexyl 2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide] enters the brain, and for this reason, this FGIN-1 compound is potent and efficacious behaviorally. Like the neurosteroid 3 alpha-5 alpha tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), FGIN-1-27 delays the onset of isoniazid-induced convulsions, but fails to delay the onset of bicuculline-induced convulsions. However, differently from THDOC, the FGIN-1-27 anticonvulsant action is blocked by the isoquinoline carboxamide PK 11195. In the elevated plus maze test, FGIN-1-27 inhibits neophobia manner that is antagonized by PK 11195 but not by flumazenil. Because FGIN-1-27 binds to MDR and does not bind to the GABAA receptors, it is inferred that FGIN-1-27 may act on GABAA receptors indirectly, presumably via a stimulation of neurosteroid synthesis and release from glial cells.", 
    "71": "The objective of these studies was to determine whether the chronic administration of choline, like the chronic administration of nicotine, increased the density of nicotine binding sites in brain. To accomplish this, rats were maintained on a choline-deficient (0% choline chloride), basal choline (0.2% choline chloride) or choline-supplemented (2.0% choline chloride) diet for 30 days or were fed a standard rodent chow and received injections of saline or nicotine (3.6 mumol/kg s.c.) twice daily for 10 days. Membranes from striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex were isolated, and the binding of L-(-)-[N-methyl-3H]nicotine (0.5-60 nM) was studied. A single binding site for nicotine was evident for all brain regions from all animals studied with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 2 to 5 nM. Chronic supplementation with choline, which increased circulating choline levels by 92%, did not alter binding affinity, but increased significantly the maximal number (Bmax) of nicotine binding sites in cortical and hippocampal membranes by 20 and 73%, respectively, compared to animals fed the basal choline diet; the Bmax in striatal membranes was unaltered. Nicotine binding parameters for membranes from animals maintained on the choline-deficient diet were not different from those maintained on the basal diet. The chronic administration of nicotine did not alter binding affinity, but increased significantly the maximal density of nicotine binding sites in striatal and cortical preparations by 47 and 18%, respectively; the Bmax in hippocampal membranes was unaltered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

They correspond, respectively, to anxious depressions, double depressions, anergic depressions, rapid-cycling depressions, and hostile depressions. The author argues that, despite a certain degree of overlap in pharmacologic response, each prototype has a relatively unique profile, including benzodiazepines, MAOIs, SSRIs, TCAs, lithium, low dose neuroleptics and anti-epileptic agents.",

    "74": "In a randomized blind study, we compared the neonate Apgar score, umbilical venous pH, incidence of maternal hypotension and intra-operative maternal discomfort in elective Cesarean section performed under spinal anesthesia in two groups of parturients with or without low dose midazolam as a sedative agent before the deliveries. Each group consisted of 20 parturients. Ninety percent of the mothers in the midazolam group fell asleep smoothly before the operations started. The neonates in the midazolam group were scored similar to saline control group on Apgar score and umbilical venous pH. The incidences of maternal hypotension during operation in both groups were 55%. However, the occurrence of intra-operative maternal discomfort was eleven fold more often in the saline control group. On the other hand, there existed a significant inverse correlation between uterine incision-delivery interval and Apgar score as well as umbilical venous pH. We concluded that low dose midazolam is a good sedative agent during spinal anesthesia in elective Cesarean section. It is also safe and effective even given before delivery.", 
    "75": "Premedication is one of the popular techniques in anesthesia, not only for the decrease of side effects but also for the increase of actions. Clinically, we found that plasma neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-IR) was lowered in patients who had received premedication. In rats, plasma NPY-IR was not modified by the intravenous injection of diazepam. Pethidine reduced the plasma NPY-IR level which could be reversed by naloxone. Direct inhibition of plasma NPY-IR through an activation of opioid receptors can thus be considered. To the cold-stress stimulation, plasma NPY-IR was markedly raised. Diazepam reduced this stimulation-induced increase of plasma NPY-IR in a dose-dependent manner. Similar derivative of benzodiazepine produced an inhibition in a way following the potency as that to produce anxiolytic action. Also, this inhibition was reversed by PK11195, an antagonist of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Moreover, pain-stimulated increase of plasma NPY-IR in rats was also reduced by pethidine. This action was totally reversed in the presence of naloxone, indicating the participation of opioid receptors in the process. The obtained results suggest that premedication of diazepam and/or pethidine has the ability to decrease plasma NPY-IR in animals.", 
    "76": "Rat corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) microinfused unilaterally or bilaterally into the locus coeruleus (LC) of awake, chronically cannulated rats produced a dose-dependent ECoG desynchronization and behavioral activation. ECoG spectra analysis revealed a significant decrease of total voltage power and of 0.25-3 and 3-6 Hz frequency bands. These effects were prevented by a pretreatment into the same site with alpha-hCRF, a selective antagonist at CRF receptors and by alprazolam, a benzodiazepine derivative. In conclusion, the present results indicate that CRF produces its behavioral and ECoG activating effects by interaction with specific receptors located on LC neurons.", 
    "77": "Time-concentration studies of clonazepam (CZP) were performed in 7-, 14-, and 28-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood samples and brains were collected at specific intervals following a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 2.5 mg/kg of CZP. CZP concentrations were measured both in plasma and brain samples by high performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using R-Strip for each age group. The results were compared between the age groups and with those of a similar study in our laboratory using lower dose CZP (1 mg/kg) SC injections in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Younger rats had slower, delayed and higher peak concentrations, larger areas under the curve (AUC), longer elimination half lives (T1/2), smaller volumes of distribution (Vd) and slower clearances (C1). 28-day-old rats showed the fastest C1, smallest AUC and largest Vd. These data suggest that the pharmacokinetic behavior of CZP is age-dependent. If this is true in human, it is implicated in dosing of neonatal or pediatric patients.", 
    "78": "The effects of iloprost, a chemically stable analog of prostacyclin, on motor activity, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)- and strychnine (ST)-induced seizures were studied in rats. Depression on motor activity was observed after a 500 ng/icv dose. Thus, both spontaneous locomotor activity and exploratory behavior were significantly reduced. While iloprost was ineffective against ST-induced seizures, it produced dose-dependent inhibition of PTZ-induced seizures. ED50 (95% confidence limits) value of iloprost for the suppression of clonic convulsions induced by PTZ was 224.96 (100.43-504.00) ng/icv. Anticonvulsive effect of iloprost was significantly potentiated by clonazepam pretreatment. In this case ED50 of iloprost was 39.40 (23.88-65.01) ng/icv. Unilateral iloprost injections into substantia nigra pars reticulata in a relatively lower dose range (0.5-2.0 ng/ic) also dose-dependently inhibited PTZ-induced seizures. In comparison to other prostanoids iloprost seems to have more potent and selective anticonvulsive activity against PTZ-induced seizures without marked motor depressant action in rats. It is further suggested that antiseizure effect of iloprost might be mediated by GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms.", 
    "79": "The olfactory bulb (OB) kindling is a model of limbic secondary generalized epilepsy. Ten days after the completion of OB kindling, we have studied the long term effects of both electrode insertion and kindling on the binding of [3H]diazepam to crude mitochondrial fractions. On the one hand, we have shown that electrode implantation in sham-operated controls induced an obvious increase in benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor density (Bmax) only at the site of the electrode in comparison to sham-unoperated rats. These results might indicate an additional mechanism extending earlier observations reported by others, who have shown that prolonged electrode implantation induced changes in sham-operated and kindled rats. On the other hand, the long lasting effect of OB kindling on the binding parameters of [3H]diazepam was examined in the focus and in the hippocampus. The results indicate a bilateral increase of BZD receptors in the OB and an ipsilateral increase in the hippocampus. These changes might be a regulation phenomenon in response to a hyperexcitability state and to focal stimulations.", 
    "80": "Endozepines are naturally occurring small organic molecules, devoid of peptidic bonds and halogens, that act as allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor through their actions at the benzodiazepine binding site. Endozepines are present in physiologically significant amounts in the brain and can act as potent positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor. In this study, 3 endozepines present in cultured cerebellar granule cells were found to be released from neurons in a potassium-stimulated, calcium-dependent fashion. This release could also be mimicked by increasing concentrations of veratridine. Although endozepines were also found in cultured astrocytes, they could not be released in significant amounts by potassium depolarization. Differential release under depolarizing conditions and granule cell content of the various endozepines suggested a possible metabolic relationship between these two processes.", 
    "81": "Adrenal corticosteroids and adrenalectomy (ADX) have opposing effects on benzodiazepine binding sites in brain regions. These treatments were employed to study [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) binding in regions punched out from the rat spinal cord. We found that binding was higher in dorsal horn than in ventral horn, and minimal in white matter. Clonazepam and RO 15-1788 largely displaced [3H]FLU binding, whereas RO 5-4864 was weakly active. Four days post-ADX, binding increased exclusively in the dorsal horn, and this effect was reversed by administration of corticosterone (CORT), but not dexamethasone (DEX) or aldosterone (ALDO) given over 4 days. When endogenous CORT was increased by administration of cold stress to adrenal-intact rats, reduced benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding was also observed in the dorsal horn. When added in vitro, only ALDO and not CORT or DEX, inhibited [3H]FLU binding. It is suggested that steroids with affinity for the type I corticosteroid receptor (CORT, ALDO) decrease [3H]FLU binding to a neural-type BDZ receptor in the dorsal horn. Reduction of the inhibitory BDZ system may be physiologically important, and can partly explain the enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission produced by corticosteroids at the level of the spinal cord.", 
    "82": "Peripheral administration of various benzodiazepine derivatives or beta-carbolines (inverse agonists at benzodiazepine receptors), has been shown to affect memory. In this study, the effect of local infusion of a beta-carboline-methyl beta carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) of rats was examined in a two-trial recognition task. The results show that beta-CMM (3 micrograms/0.5 microliter) enhances recognition performance when injected both before or immediately after the acquisition trial. These effects appear to be mediated by a benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor since they were blocked by pretreatment with Ro 15-1788, a BZD receptor antagonist. This study supports the involvement of the NBM in cognitive processes, and demonstrates that these processes can be influenced by alteration of GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "83": "In a three-panel runway task, the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide at 3.2 and 10 mg/kg i.p. significantly increased the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points) in a test of working memory, but it had no effect on errors in a test of reference memory. This effect of 10 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide on working memory was blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil at 10 mg/kg. Intrahippocampal injection of chlordiazepoxide at 10 and 32 micrograms/side significantly increased the number of working memory errors. This effect of intrahippocampal chlordiazepoxide (32 micrograms/side) was attenuated not only by flumazenil at 10 mg/kg but also by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor antagonist bicuculline at 3.2 mg/kg. Intrahippocampal injection of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol at 100 and 320 ng/side also significantly increased working memory errors. Neither chlordiazepoxide nor muscimol affected the number of reference memory errors when injected into the hippocampus at doses up to 32 micrograms/side or 320 ng/side, respectively. These results suggest that activation of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the hippocampus impairs working memory, but does not affect reference memory.", 
    "84": "Ceruletide (CLT), a cholecystokinin-like peptide was given subcutaneously or via the perfusate to rats to clarify the site of action (peripheral vs. central location) of CLT, using in vivo microdialysis techniques. Striatal dopamine (DA) release induced by haloperidol (HPD) was significantly inhibited by subcutaneously administered CLT (160 micrograms/kg) when given with a perfusate containing 15 mM K+. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomies failed to block the inhibitory effect of CLT. CLT (10(-15)-10(-11) M) locally applied, via a dialysis tube, produced an inhibitory effect on HPD-induced DA release in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of CLT given subcutaneously on DA release was antagonized by both locally applied proglumide and systemically administered L-365,260. These findings suggest that systemically administered CLT can directly act on the striatal neurons via CCK-B receptors and produce an inhibitory effect on DA release in the striatum under appropriate depolarization.", 
    "85": "Male ICR mice were fed powdered laboratory chow containing phenobarbital for 7 days to induce tolerance. Mice were sacrificed and brains assayed for changes in GABA-mediated chloride flux into brain membrane vesicles (microsacs). Concentration-dependent stimulation of chloride flux by GABA alone was not affected by the development of tolerance to phenobarbital. Phenobarbital potentiation of GABA-mediated chloride flux was significantly attenuated in the membranes prepared from phenobarbital-tolerant mice compared with those from pair-fed control mice. Similarly, stimulation of GABA-mediated flux by the benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam was also depressed in membranes from tolerant mice. However, the ability of ethanol and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG-7142 to modulate GABA-gated chloride flux was not affected by the development of phenobarbital tolerance. No significant changes in saturation [3H]diazepam binding parameters were observed. These findings suggest that there is a degree of cross-tolerance between phenobarbital and benzodiazepine agonist at the level of the GABA-operated chloride channel. Furthermore, although some reports have demonstrated behavioral cross-tolerance between ethanol and barbiturates, the present data suggest different mechanisms of tolerance development for these intoxicants at the level of the GABAA receptor chloride channel complex.", 
    "86": "A case of the female caucasian patient with constricting tuberculous pericarditis is presented. The patient has been treated with tuberculostatics, which produced severe to ic liver damage, and ultimately the death. A risk of liver damage increases with patients' age and the jaundice onset in the period shorter than two months after the start of therapy. Prognosis is poor in case of HBs carrier state, alcohol abuse, therapy with benzodiazepines, and oral contraceptives. A moderate increase in transaminases activity does not require a cessation of the drugs but a reduction of the administered doses is necessary, especially in patients over 35 years of age. Patients of the height risk group require a careful selection of antitubercular+ agents. Patients with suspected chronic liver disease should be carefully examined, together with liver biopsy, before tuberculostatics are given.", 
    "87": "Radioligand binding studies were performed in order to elucidate the mechanism of action of anxiolytic-neuroleptic homophthalazines. Rat striatal membrane preparations were found to bind 3H-EGIS 6775 [3H-GYKI-52 322, 3H-(1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-dimethoxy-5H-homophthalazine)] in a specific and displaceable manner. Several other brain regions tested were devoid of similar binding activity. Saturation analysis revealed that binding affinity was in the 10(-8)-10(-7) M range. Binding was enhanced by Mg2+ ions and, to a smaller extent by Ca2+ ions. The binding principle was sensitive to heat or trypsin treatment. This specific binding site appears, according to competition studies, different from the receptors whose presence in the rat striatum has been reported earlier.", 
    "88": "Over the period 1981 to 1989, the number of admissions to Dutch general hospitals for barbiturate poisoning has dropped sharply and steadily, due to a more restrictive policy in prescribing regarding these sedatives. This trend is also present concerning poisoning with sedatives and hypnotics in general (ICD-code 967), but not concerning those with benzodiazepines (ICD-code 969.4). The female-male ratio was nearly 2:1. This difference is possibly due to the fact that females take more medication than males.", 
    "89": "A template-directed approach to the design of a DNA-DNA interstrand cross-linker based upon the structure of a bis-tomaymycin-duplex adduct has been carried out. Tomaymycin is a member of the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines antitumor antibiotics. In a previous study (F.L. Boyd et al., Biochemistry 1990, 29, 2387-2403), we have shown that two tomaymycin molecules can be covalently bound to a 12-mer duplex molecule, where the drug molecules are on opposite strands six base-pairs apart, and the stereochemistry at the drug bonding site, and orientation in the minor groove, was defined by high-field NMR. This bis-tomaymycin 12-mer duplex adduct maintains the self-complementarity of the duplex and a B-type structure. In the present study we have shown using high-field NMR that this same 12-mer sequence can be truncated by two base pairs so that the two tomaymycin-modified guanines are now only four base-pairs apart, the two species of tomaymycin molecules are still bound with the same stereochemistry and orientation, and the 10-mer duplex adduct maintains its self-complementarity. In a second 10-mer duplex we have shown that changing the bonding sequence from 5'CGA to 5'AGC does not significantly affect the structure of the bis-tomaymycin-duplex adduct. However, when the sequence is rearranged so that the drugs point in a tail-to-tail orientation rather than in the previous head-to-head configuration, there are more than one species of tomaymycin bound to DNA, and, as a consequence, the bis-tomaymycin 10-mer duplex adduct loses its self-complementarity. Last, we have used the 10-mer duplex containing the 5'CGA sequence, in which the tomaymycin molecules are oriented head to head, to design an interstrand cross-linking species in which the two drug molecules are linked together with a flexible linker molecule.", 
    "90": "During the past five years, the literature has tended to prove the occurrence of \"natural benzodiazepines\" in tissues and biological fluids of non-medicated humans. Several have been identified but very few papers deal with their quantitation in biological material. We present here a method for the specific and sensitive measurement of serum levels of diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam by gas chromatography with selected-ion monitoring mass spectrometry in twenty human volunteers without medication. Diazepam was found over the whole population, in the range 7.3-32.0 pg/ml, identical in males and females. The other two were present in only some individuals (1.0-7.6 pg/ml for N-desmethyldiazepam and 2.0-13.0 pg/ml for oxazepam). The origin (endogenous, dietary or microbial) of these substances is still to be elucidated.", 
    "91": "The novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, WAY100289, was examined in two animal models of anxiety: the mouse two-compartment light: dark box, and the rat potentiated acoustic startle paradigm. The activity of WAY100289 in the light: dark box model was also compared with that of the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron, zacopride, ICS-205,930 and quaternary ICS-205,930 (QICS). WAY100289 mimicked the activity profile of benzodiazepine positive controls in the mouse light: dark box, i.e. WAY100289 markedly and significantly increased the exploratory activity of mice in the more aversive light compartment, at doses of 0.01-1.0 mg/kg s.c. and 0.1-10.0 mg/kg p.o. Zacopride and ondansetron induced comparable effects at doses of 0.001-1.0 mg/kg s.c. ICS-205,930 displayed a markedly biphasic dose-response relationship; being active at 0.01 mg/kg s.c., but not at higher or lower doses. QICS was not active in the light: dark box up to a dose of 10 mg/kg s.c., suggesting that the compound does not enter the brain readily. WAY100289 was also active in the rat potentiated acoustic startle model, significantly attenuating the potentiated startle response at doses of 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg s.c. The activity profile of WAY100289 in this model resembled that of ondansetron. These data strongly suggest that WAY100289 may possess anxiolytic properties in the clinic."
