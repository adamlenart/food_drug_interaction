    "0": "When subjected to ultraviolet light flunitrazepam could be irreversibly attached to brain membrane preparations such that the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for certain ligands, such as diazepam, becomes markedly reduced. However, the apparent affinity for diazepam is increased by the addition of gamma-aminobutyric acid and sodium chloride, to the same extent in this membrane preparation as in membranes not so pretreated. This observation suggests that photoaffinity labelling of the benzodiazepine receptor with flunitrazepam modifies the recognition characteristics of the receptor but not its effector mechanism.", 
    "1": "The biotransformation of the labelled forms of 1-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-4-methyl-5-ethyl-7,8-dimethyoxy-5H-2,3-be nzodiazepine (Grandaxin, tofizopam) has been investigated after oral administration in animals and man. The major part of urinary metabolites was found to be conjugated with glucuronic acid. The metabolites were separated using TLC technique and analysed by GLC and GLC-MS. The chief way of the metabolic information of tofizopam is demethylation, however, the position of CH3 elimination as well as the rate of it was different in various species.", 
    "2": "In state of tolerance to the sedative effect of nitrazepam (NTZ) its pharmacokinetic properties are changed: the absorption is slowed down, the elimination, in contrast, is accelerated due to the rapid biotransformation. The NTZ content in brain tissue is increased significantly with respect to the brain levels of animals treated with a single dose of NTZ. In animals of only moderate intensity of tolerance produced by oxazepam (OX) the brain concentrations of OX are correlated with the developed tolerance.", 
    "3": "The aim of the first part of this work is to present the theory of the radioreceptor assay and to compare it to the other techniques of radioanalysis (radioimmunoassay, competitive protein binding assays). The technology of the radioreceptor assay is then presented and its components (preparation of the receptors, radioligand, incubation medium) are described. The analytical characteristics of the radioreceptor assay (specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy) and the pharmacological significance of the results are discussed. The second part is devoted to the description of the radioreceptor assays of some pharmacological classes (neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, anticholinergic drugs) and to their use in therapeutic drug monitoring. In conclusion, by their nature, radioreceptor assays are highly sensitive, reliable, precise, accurate and simple to perform. Their chief disadvantage relates to specificity, since any substance having an appreciable affinity to the receptor site will displace the specifically bound radioligand. Paradoxically in some cases, this lack of specificity may be advantageous in that it allows for the detection of not only the apparent compound but of active metabolites and endogenous receptor agonists as well and in that radioreceptors assays can be devised for a whole pharmacological class and not only for one drug as it is the case for classical physico-chemical techniques. For all these reasons future of radioreceptor assay in pharmacology appears promising.", 
    "4": "Effects of benzodiazepines on spinal reflex potentials, especially on the dorsal root reflex potentials (DRR), were studied in the spinal preparation of cats. All benzodiazepines used in this study (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, bromazepam, flurazepam, medazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, oxazolazepam, lorazepam, estazolam and triazolam) were administered into the duodenum via a rubber tube implanted previously. These drugs consistently increased the amplitude of DRR. Presynaptic inhibition was increased, but postsynaptic inhibition was not affected by the drugs. DRR was decreased gradually by intravenous administration of semicarbazide, and pretreatment with semicarbazide completely blocked the spinal effect of diazepam. Pyridoxine given intravenously recovered the amplitude of DRR and restored the effect of diazepam on the spinal cord. Pretreatment of AOAA potentiated the increasing effect of diazepam on DRR. Occlusion of the thoracic aorta for 47 min with simultaneous clamping of the mammary arteries produced permanent hind-limb rigidity in cats (Murayama-type rigid cats). The ischemic spinal rigidity is characterized by an enhanced monosynaptic reflex and markedly reduced polysynaptic reflex potentials. Furthermore, DRR was not grossly detectable in the preparation. In these ischemic spinal rigid cats, diazepam administered intravenously or intraduodenally did not enhance DRR at all. These results suggest that the effect of diazepam is closely related with GABA content. Normal levels of GABA in the spinal cord are required for the increasing effect of diazepam on DRR and presynaptic inhibition. These benzodiazepines may act on the releasing mechanism of GABA from the spinal interneuron, or they presumably enhance the sensitivity of the GABA receptor in the spinal cord.", 
    "5": "The sleep-inducing activity and effect on the motor system of the 1H-1,2,4-triazolyl benzophenone derivative 450191-S were examined behaviorally, electroencephalographically and electro-physiologically with various species of animals and were compared with those of diazepam, nitrazepam, estazolam and triazolam. In the rhesus monkey, rabbit and rat with chronically indwelling brain electrodes, 0.6 to 3 mg/kg, p.o. of 450191-S caused a shorter latency of sleep onset, an increase of and a stable continuity of slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) with higher amplitude, and the appearance of clear spindle bursts in the slow wave light sleeping (SWLS) state with little muscle relaxation. Animals treated with nitrazepam and/or estazolam showed a smaller increase in SWDS and its unstable continuity with remarkable disturbance of gait. The doses needed to induce sleep in the rhesus monkey were 0.6 to 1 mg/kg p.o. for 450191-S, 3 mg/kg for nitrazepam, 1 mg/kg for estazolam and 0.3 mg/kg for triazolam. The cat treated with 450191-S showed the phenomena caused by benzodiazepines (BDZ), i.e., behavioral excitation and decrease of frequencies in the hippocampal theta waves. The suppressive effects of 450191-S on the EEG arousal reaction and/or blood pressure elevation induced by hypothalamic stimulation in the rabbit suggested that the inhibitory effects acted on the posterior hypothalamus to the limbic system. The inhibitory effect of 450191-S on the amygdaloid kindling in the rat was as potent as those of diazepam and nitrazepam. Successive daily oral administration of both 3 mg/kg of 450191-S and/or 3 to 6 mg/kg of nitrazepam for 15 days in the rabbit caused slight decrease of SWDS and increase of fast wave (REM) sleep (FWS). During the withdrawal period of both compounds, a slight but insignificant increase in the waking state was noticed for 1 to 2 days, but not a rebound increase of FWS. Intravenously administered 450191-S showed the same action as BDZ on the spinal reflex and the dorsal root potential of the rat; it particularly acted on the crossed extensor reflex in the same manner as the commercial BDZ sleep inducers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The behavioral effects of 450191-S and its metabolites were investigated in mice, rats, cats and rhesus monkeys, and they were compared with those of related benzodiazepines (BDZ) such as diazepam and nitrazepam. Oral administration of 450191-S consistently caused sedation without excitability in mice and rats, and it was only 1/2 to 1/266 as potent as the BDZ in producing motor incoordination as assessed by traction, rotarod performance and inclined screen tests in mice, induced much less ataxia in cats and monkeys, and inhibited respiration in anesthetized cats. The locomotor activities of mice and rats measured by Animex and the open field test were not affected by 450191-S, but rearing and preening decreased with 450191-S as with the BDZ. 450191-S was equipotent with nitrazepam and 2 to 6 times more potent than diazepam and estazolam in potentiating chlorprothixene-induced hypnosis and thiopental-Na-induced anesthesia. These effects were not different with successive 14-day administration of 450191-S. Anti-pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin and bicuculline convulsions of 450191-S had the same potency as nitrazepam, but caused much less anti-electroshock convulsion than the BDZ. 450191-S had potent antianxiety activity as observed by anti-aggressive and anti-conflict activities and had almost the same effect as diazepam on operant behavior. The metabolites M-1, M-2, M-A and M-3 showed approximately the same potency as 450191-S in inducing anesthetic potentiation and antianxiety activity, but they were much more potent in causing disturbance of the somatic functions. These results indicate that 450191-S possesses inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, including a potent sleep-inducing effect, and is characterized by markedly weak muscle relaxant activity and motor incoordination.", 
    "7": "Both human and animal studies relating to the combined effects of alcohol and benzodiazepine (BZD) are reviewed. Although the combination of alcohol and BZD is sometimes associated with drug-induced deaths, drug overdoses and traffic accidents or fatalities, epidemiological information is lacking on the true extent of the combined abuse and on the patterns and prevalence of use of these two drugs. Since BZD are widely used for the short- and long-term treatment of alcoholics, these patients are deemed more at risk of developing BZD or alcohol/BZD dependence than the general population. There is a dire need for large-scale controlled studies concerning the efficacy of BZD in the long-term treatment of alcoholics. Compared to men, women are at a higher risk as far as the potential for BZD addiction is concerned, since they tend to use BZD more often. Epidemiologic studies on the patterns of use of BZD, alcohol or alcohol/BZD in pregnant women are called for. Animal models are also needed to ascertain whether prenatal exposure to both alcohol and BZD can impart long-lasting behavioral changes in the progeny. It is possible that BZD can exacerbate the damaging prenatal effects of alcohol.", 
    "8": "The disposition of 14C-quazepam (7-chloro-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) [5-14C]-5-o-fluorophenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-thione), a new benzodiazepine hypnotic, was studied in hamsters and mice after iv and po dosing. In both species, quazepam was rapidly absorbed, as indicated by the plasma Cmax being reached within 1 hr of an oral dose (5 mg/kg). Also, radioactivity is essentially completely absorbed in both species, since the percentage of dose excreted in the urine was not dependent on the route of drug administration. Radioactivity was widely distributed in the tissues of both species; however, it was concentrated (relative to plasma) only in the liver and kidneys. In hamsters, 66-77% of the radioactivity was excreted within 48 hr, and 97% within 7 days of dosing (57% found in urine and 40% in feces after iv; 54% in urine and 43% in feces after po dosing). In mice, 86-88% of the radioactivity was excreted within 24 hr, and 98% within 4 days of dosing (43% in urine and 56% in feces after iv, 37% in urine and 61% in feces after po dosing). In both species, plasma levels of quazepam, measured by GLC, accounted for a very small percentage of plasma radioactivity and the elimination half-life was short (2.4 hr in hamster and 1.2 hr in mice), indicating extensive first pass metabolism for this drug. TLC analysis of plasma and urine extracts from both species showed biotransformation of quazepam involved substitution of oxygen for sulfur, followed by: (a) N-dealkylation, 3-hydroxylation, and conjugation or (b) 3-hydroxylation and conjugation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "This study is a double-blind comparative trial of flurazepam and temazepam in the treatment of insomnia, using subjective assessments with an analogue scale technique and questionnaire. The main dependent variable in this experiment is vigilance. The two drugs differ essentially in their half life value. (Flurazepam +/- 72 h; temazepam +/- 8 h). It can be predicted that temazepam causes less impairment of vigilance than flurazepam, and that the difference between the two drugs is more pronounced when the number of days the drugs are taken consecutively, increases. In statistical terms an interaction effect between drugs and days should be expected. The results show no effect at all, neither the predicted interaction effect, nor any main effect. If there is a difference in efficiency reduction between patients, the assessment methods used were unable to measure it. These findings warn against a possible overestimation of clinical relevance of the plasma elimination half-life of benzodiazepines.", 
    "10": "The triazolopyridazine, CL218,872, inhibited the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the cerebellum more potently than in cortex, both in vitro and in vivo. The relationship between this phenomenon and the selectivity of benzodiazepine receptor subtypes is considered. In a range of behavioural tests the overall profile of CL218,872 was similar to that of diazepam in the rat and mouse, although CL218,872 was half as potent as diazepam in the rat and some 20-fold weaker in the mouse. In particular contrast to published observations, CL218,872 reduced locomotor activity in rats and mice at doses only slightly larger than those required to inhibit conflict in rats and footshock-induced fighting in mice. The only qualitative difference between the compounds that could be detected was in the mouse where large doses of CL218,872 did not produce the marked degree of motor incoordination seen after diazepam. However, no such difference was observed in the rat. The presently held view that CL 218,872 is a non-sedative anxiolytic agent needs to be revised in the light of these observations.", 
    "11": "Twelve adult neurological patients undergoing lumbar puncture for diagnostic purposes received acute or repeated doses of the 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam 20-40 mg/day. In one patient, additional ventricle cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected in the course of the diagnostic procedure and the respective concentrations of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam were determined. The serum and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of clobazam and its main metabolite N-desmethylclobazam were compared. The concentrations of both clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam were higher in serum than in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam showed similar increase and decline in the ventricle CSF of one patient. This result differed from the pharmacokinetics of clobazam and its main metabolite in the blood which is characterized by a slower increase and a more prolonged elimination of N-desmethylclobazam, as opposed to the parent compound.", 
    "12": "Since up to 90% of a theophylline dose is biotransformed, drugs influencing microsomal enzyme systems in the liver may affect the elimination of theophylline. Other integrated mechanisms (e.g. hepatic uptake) may also be altered by concurrent administration of other drugs. Whatever the mechanism, the interaction may be sufficient to necessitate adjustment of the theophylline dosage, preferably guided by plasma theophylline determinations. Comedication with phenobarbitone may require an increase of the theophylline dose by about 30% due to increased clearance resulting from enzyme induction. Similarly, with phenytoin and carbamazepine a dose increase of about 40 to 50% may be required. In the case of rifampicin, isoniazid or sulphinpyrazone comedication, an increase of the theophylline dose by about 20 to 25% may be needed. On the other hand, other drugs decrease theophylline clearance, making a reduction in the dose of concurrent theophylline advisable: with usual doses of erythromycin, propranolol and isoprenaline (isoproterenol), a reduction of about 25% is needed; with cimetidine and oral contraceptives by about 30% or more; and with triacetyloleandomycin (troleandomycin) by about 50%. In high doses, the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol can also retard theophylline elimination, and a reduction of the theophylline dose by about 20% may be advisable. Conflicting results have been reported on the influence of frusemide (furosemide) and influenza vaccines, while data regarding the effect of corticosteroids, benzodiazepines and verapamil on theophylline kinetics are not yet conclusive. Many drugs, however, appear not to significantly affect theophylline clearance. Some are from the same therapeutic group as the drugs mentioned above and offer clinical alternatives for coadministration with theophylline. Examples of drugs not found to have a significant effect on theophylline pharmacokinetics are ranitidine, josamycin, midecamycin, amoxycillin, tetracycline, cephalexin, cefaclor, orciprenaline, metoprolol, antacids, medroxyprogesterone acetate, metoclopramide and metronidazole.

    "14": "Midazolam is a water soluble benzodiazepine of interest to the anaesthetist for use as a premedicant and for induction of anaesthesia. The effects of midazolam were observed on the resting tension of directly stimulated muscle biopsied from control and malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptible patients. In addition, interactions between midazolam and the two most commonly used MH diagnostic agents (halothane and caffeine) were examined. Midazolam, at maximum therapeutic concentrations (ca. 0.5 microgram X ml-1), had no detectable effects on muscle contraction in preparations from control or MH positive patients. Midazolam did elicit a contracture from control and MH positive preparations when used in a concentration range of 160-1280 micrograms X ml-1. There was no significant difference between control and MH positive patients in minimum concentration of midazolam causing contracture or the strength of contracture at the respective eliciting concentration. There appears to be no interaction between midazolam and either halothane or caffeine on the resting tension of the directly stimulated muscle twitch preparation.", 
    "15": "Our study sought to determine whether premedication with intramuscular midazolam would decrease the time to induction of anaesthesia with intravenous midazolam, and if so whether induction of anaesthesia would be as rapid as with thiopentone or ketamine, intravenously. Eight-nine patients, ASA physical status I or II, received midazolam 0.2 mg X kg-1, thiopentone 3.0 mg X kg-1, or ketamine 2.0 mg X kg-1 intravenously 60-90 min after intramuscular injection of either midazolam 0.07 mg X kg-1 or matching placebo. Time to induction of anaesthesia or the dose required to induce anaesthesia with intravenous midazolam was not decreased by midazolam premedication. Both with or without premedication, midazolam induction time was longer than with thiopentone or ketamine. Midazolam induction was associated with a lower incidence of blood pressure increase than with ketamine induction, and a lower incidence of apnea than that with either thiopentone or ketamine.", 
    "16": "The bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on performance of lormetazepam (1 mg) have been compared using soft gelatin capsule and tablet formulations. Lormetazepam was more rapidly absorbed from the soft gelatin capsule (tmax = 1.0 +/- 0.2 h) than from the tablet (tmax = 2.4 +/- 0.4 h), and the plasma concentration-time curve for the capsule was shifted to the left. Bioavailability and elimination kinetics did not differ between the formulations. The number of substitutions in the digit symbol test was reduced between 0.5 and 1.5 h for both formulations (P less than 0.001), but the degree of impairment at 0.5 h was greater after the capsule than after the tablet (P less than 0.01). Visuo-motor co-ordination was impaired from 0.5 to 1.5 h after the tablet and the capsule (P less than 0.01), and extended to 5.5 h after the tablet (P less than 0.05). These observations reflect the differences in the plasma concentration-time curves.", 
    "17": "Symptomatic treatment of transient insomnias is advisable, for without treatment these sleep disorders may become persistent. The drugs of choice are the benzodiazepine hypnotics, which have minimal side effects when used for short periods in properly selected patients. The three such drugs currently available in the United States differ enough in half-life, absorption rate, and potential for drug interactions that they cannot be used interchangeably. A sound selection matches the drug's characteristics with the patient's needs. Transient insomnias must be differentiated from persistent insomnias, which are more resistant to treatment. Hypnotic agents not only are more likely to be ineffective against persistent insomnias but also have greater potential for exacerbating a sleep-related breathing disorder, producing a drug-dependent insomnia, or contributing to drug misuse.",

The scores of seven patients (44%) whose benzodiazepine was withdrawn abruptly increased 10% or more on both the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the Self Rating Symptom Scale. There were no cases of rebound anxiety in 14 patients whose benzodiazepine was withdrawn gradually; fewer cases of rebound anxiety were seen with a benzodiazepine that had a long half-life.",

    "22": "The effects of ACTH(1-24) on the potentiation of hexobarbitone sleeping time by chlordiazepoxide (CDP) were investigated in the rat. CDP (10 mg/kg, IP) significantly (p less than 0.001) potentiated hexobarbitone (100 mg/kg, IP)-induced sleeping time. This effect was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced by ACTH(1-24) (10 micrograms/100 g, IP), although ACTH did not influence the response to hexobarbitone in the absence of CDP. The possible implications of these findings are discussed in relation to recent observations concerning the possible interactions between ACTH and benzodiazepines.", 
    "23": "The purpose of this study was to examine the benzodiazepine-like activity of fominoben-HCl, a compound with prominent antitussive and respiratory stimulant actions. Towards this end we examined the anticonvulsant actions of fominoben as well as its ability to displace benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding from brain membranes. Scatchard analysis of binding data demonstrated that fominoben displaced 3H-flunitrazepam binding from rat cortical membrane preparations. Furthermore when tested against 3H-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, the addition of GABA resulted in a mean (+/- SE) shift of the IC50 from 4.05 +/- 0.10 microM to 2.2 +/- 0.05 microM, a characteristic of benzodiazepine agonists. Seizures were induced in male, Swiss Webster mice with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (3-MP). Fominoben (50 and 100 mg/kg) completely protected mice from seizures induced by 50 mg/kg PTZ and elevated the seizure latency against 75 mg/kg of PTZ. The anticonvulsant effects of fominoben were less pronounced against 3-MP-induced seizures. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 antagonized the anticonvulsant action of fominoben against both convulsants. Taken together, these data suggest that the anticonvulsant action of fominoben may be mediated by agonistic actions at benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "24": "Conformational and electronic properties of a series of 1,4-benzodiazepine analogues and their specific interaction with a model cationic receptor site have been calculated using both empirical energy and semiempirical molecular orbital methods. The aim of these studies was to identify molecular properties and modes of receptor interaction which are determinants of relative receptor affinities and pharmacological activities for these anxiolytics. Analogues with variations in key positions of the 7-membered (B) ring, at positions C7, C8, and C9 of the fused phenyl (A) ring, and at positions 2' and 4' of the phenyl (C) ring were examined. The results indicate that both active and inactive analogues have similar low-energy conformations, arguing against this property as a modulator of recognition at the receptor. However, calculated molecular electrostatic potentials together with explicit model receptor interactions allowed the deduction that interactions with three cationic receptor sites are required for high-affinity analogues. The specific cationic site interactions are postulated with electron-withdrawing groups at C7, the C2 = O1 group, and the imine nitrogen, N4. Moreover, interactions of N4 with a model cationic receptor site are enhanced by halogen substituents at C2', but only when the phenyl ring is rotated by 30 degrees toward a more planar conformer, corresponding to an induced conformational change. If this enhancement is important, a 2'-Cl substituent on more rigid analogues of the 1,4-benzodiazepines with increased co-planarity of the phenyl C-ring and the C1'--C5 = N4 plane should have an even greater differential effect on receptor affinity.", 
    "25": "Quantitative light-microscope autoradiography has been used to compare the specific, clonazepam-displaceable binding of [3H]flunitrazepam, a photoaffinity label for the 1,4-benzodiazepine receptor, in different regions of the brain and spinal cord of spastic mice and their unaffected littermates. Specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the central nervous system of the spastic mouse showed significant increases in the anterior colliculus and pretectal area and in all laminae of the grey matter in the lumbar spinal cord. These results confirm homogenate binding assays suggesting an increased number of benzodiazepine receptors in the spinal cord of the spastic mouse. Possible sites are therefore provided at which disorders of function could arise, associated with changes seen at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex in spinal cord homogenates from the mutant mouse spastic.",

    "28": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) produce most, if not all, of their pharmacological actions by specifically enhancing the effects of endogenous and exogenous GABA that are mediated by GABAA receptors. This potentiation consists in an increase of the apparent affinity of GABA for increasing chloride conductance without increase in its efficacy and, on the single chloride channel level, seems to be the result of an increased probability of channel opening events. Recent studies indicate that the BZR is a site on the GABA receptor (GABA-R)-chloride channel complex, through which the gain of the signal transducer function of the latter is allosterically modulated. The unique feature of this drug receptor, which is located on a neurotransmitter receptor-gated ion channel, is its specific interaction with three classes of ligands. Agonists, competitive antagonists and inverse agonists at BZR, respectively increase, do not alter and reduce the gain of the GABA-R function. Compounds have been found that cover a whole spectrum of transition between the two extremes (partial agonists, partial inverse agonists) and for which interesting therapeutic applications can be foreseen.",

Valproate and diazepam protected mice against convulsions caused by beta-vinyllactic acid although both anti-epileptic drugs antagonized neither the decrease in GABA concentrations nor the inhibition of GAD observed after treatment with beta-vinyllactic acid alone. Assuming that the anticonvulsant effect measured with both antiepileptics is GABA mediated, these results support the hypothesis of a postsynaptic enhancement of GABAergic transmission by diazepam and valproate.", 
    "32": "The anxiogenic or anxiolytic properties of five beta-carbolines were assessed in rats trained in two-lever operant chambers to operate one lever to obtain food reward when treated with a training drug, and the other when treated with saline. Two such drug-discrimination tests were used, employing either chlordiazepoxide (CDP) or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) as training drugs. The benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist, ZK 93 423, substituted for the CDP cue and antagonized the PTZ cue. The inverse agonists DMCM and FG 7142 showed the opposite effects. An antagonist, ZK 93 426, antagonized the CDP cue but did not substitute for PTZ, while a partial agonist was identified as CDP-like but only partially antagonized the PTZ cue. An anxiolytic profile (substitution for CDP and antagonism of PTZ) was associated with GABA ratios of about 2, and an anxiogenic profile with GABA ratios less than 1. The antagonist and partial agonist displayed intermediate values. These observations are generally consistent with the beta-carbolines modulating anxiety through their activity at BZ receptors influencing GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "33": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a brain neuropeptide putative ligand for benzodiazepine binding sites, has been isolated and purified to homogeneity. This compound, like the anxiogenic beta-carbolines, injected intracerebroventricularly facilitates shock-induced suppression of drinking in thirsty rats. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage of DBI produces three peptide fragments: the carboxy terminal fragment (F3 approximately equal to 1800 mol.wt.) and an intermediate fragment (F2 approximately equal to 3200 mol.wt.) are inactive, whereas the fragment that contains the amino terminus (F1 approximately equal to 6500 mol. wt.) facilitates punishment inhibition of operant behavior in rat. These data suggest that the F1 peptide contains the active sequence. The latter might be the natural effector of benzodiazepine recognition sites while DBI could be a polyprotein functioning as the precursor of the putative endogenous ligand of the benzodiazepine recognition site.", 
    "34": "The isolated frog spinal cord was used as a test system to investigate the interactions of midazolam and caffeine with GABA-evoked responses recorded from dorsal afferent fibres. Midazolam was a potent stimulator (ED50 = 1 nM) of GABA effectiveness on this preparation since the ED50 value for GABA was nearly halved. The enhancing action of midazolam was apparently produced via activation of benzodiazepine receptor mechanisms with no detectable receptor cooperativity and with a rather high sensitivity to the selective benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 14-7437 (antagonist ED50 = 2.5 nM). Responses to glutamate, glycine or high K+ were unchanged in midazolam solutions. When midazolam was applied in concentrations equal or larger than 100 nM, antagonism of GABA responses was evident. Caffeine (50 microM) also potentiated GABA responses through a mechanism distinct from benzodiazepine receptor activation as this action of caffeine was insensitive to Ro 14-7437. Mixtures of low doses of caffeine and midazolam frequently antagonized GABA responses. It is suggested that the blockade of GABA responses by caffeine-midazolam mixtures might account for the reversal of some behavioural actions of these substances even if they probably operate through separate pharmacological mechanisms.", 
    "35": "The benzodiazepine antagonist properties of CGS8216 were evaluated in rats trained to discriminate between saline and 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam in a two-choice, stimulus-shock termination procedure. CGS8216 (0.3 to 100 mg/kg) administered alone, either s.c., p.o. or i.p., occasioned only saline-appropriate responding. When administered concomitantly with a constant 1.0 mg/kg dose of diazepam, CGS8216 produced dose-related decreases in drug-appropriate responding. CGS8216 was most potent by the i.p. route, and approximately tenfold less potent by the oral route. CGS8216 was dermatotoxic after s.c. administration. CGS8216 i.p. had a long duration of action. A dose of 30 mg/kg completely antagonized the discriminative effects of the 1.0 mg/kg training dose of diazepam when the antagonist was administered 8 hr before the start of the test session. In order to determine the type of antagonism by CGS8216, the dose-effect curve for diazepam was redetermined in the presence of varying doses of CGS8216 (0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.). CGS8216 produced a dose-related rightward shift in the diazepam dose-effect curve, but also decreased the slope and appeared to decrease the maximal effect. These results are consistent with the interpretation that CGS8216 antagonizes diazepam in a noncompetitive manner. It may do so because either it interacts with a subpopulation of benzodiazepine receptors, it functions as a pseudo-irreversible antagonist due to its high affinity, or because it is an antagonist with agonist properties.", 
    "36": "Two compounds with high affinity for the \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites, PK 11195 (an isoquinoline derivative) and RO5-4864 (a benzodiazepine derivative) can modify the sensitivity of DBA/2J mice to audiogenic seizures. RO5-4864 (1-15 mg/kg) facilitates in a dose-dependent manner the audiogenic seizures and PK 11195 (2-5 mg/kg) antagonizes the RO5-4864 effects. At these doses PK 11195 alone does not modify the sensitivity to audiogenic seizures, but at doses between 20-80 mg/kg it protects DBA/2J mice against audiogenic seizures. By contrast PK 11195 is inactive against the facilitation of audiogenic seizures by ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (a brain benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist) and against the seizure elicited in absence of noise stimuli by RO5-4864 at doses between 20-40 mg/kg. These results suggest that facilitation by RO5-4864 of the audiogenic seizures and its antagonism by PK 11195 are mediated by the peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites and agree with the thermodynamic analysis of the binding data which suggested that RO5-4864 might be an agonist and PK 11195 an antagonist. The good correlation between pharmacological effects and the occupancy degree of the binding sites as measured by the displacement of the \"in vivo\" [3H]-PK 11195 binding give an additional support to binding sites mediated effects.", 
    "37": "Using a new rat conflict test it was found that 30% of the subjects failed to respond to benzodiazepines and other anxiolytic agents. This value is similar to that reported using more classical procedures such as the Geller-Seifter and Vogel conflict tests. Biochemical analysis of various brain regions from responder (R) and non-responder (NR) subjects revealed no significant differences in 5-HT1, 5-HT2, GABA receptor binding or GABA-activated benzodiazepine binding. However, a small, but significant, increase in basal benzodiazepine binding was noted in the hippocampus of NR rats. These findings suggest that the insensitivity of these animals to anxiolytics is probably unrelated to an alteration in serotonin, GABA or benzodiazepine binding sites in brain.", 
    "38": "Cimetidine is known to impair the hepatic microsomal oxidation of diazepam, reducing its clearance and prolonging its half-life. We studied the clinical importance of this effect in 10 patients, who were receiving long-term treatment with diazepam for anxiety, tension, or difficulty in sleeping, in an eight-week double-blind controlled study during which the diazepam dosage remained constant. The study was in four two-week phases: base-line or adaptation, coadministration of cimetidine (300 mg) or matching placebo four times daily, crossover to the opposite treatment (placebo or cimetidine), and recovery treatment with diazepam alone. During the cimetidine phase, plasma concentrations of diazepam plus desmethyldiazepam rose an average of 57 per cent (P less than 0.005), then fell when cimetidine was withdrawn. However, there were no significant changes in scores on the digit-symbol-substitution test, a tracking task, or a reaction-time test. Clinical self-ratings indicated no increases in sedation, fatigue, or drowsiness. Patients experienced shortening of sleep latency (P less than 0.05) and an increase in self-rated depth or soundness of sleep (P less than 0.001) during the cimetidine period, but there were no changes in sleep duration or in the number of nocturnal awakenings. Although coadministration of cimetidine to diazepam-treated patients causes a large increase in plasma diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations, the increase is of minimal clinical importance.", 
    "39": "The effects of RO 15-1788, RO 5-3663, picrotoxin and bicuculline on the anti-conflict properties of valproate were studied in rats using a modified Vogel 's conflict test procedure. A low dose of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) antagonist, RO 15-1788 (5 mg/kg), blocked the anti-punishment properties of valproate (400 mg/kg), whereas no antagonism was observed after a high dose (25 mg/kg) of the BDZ antagonist. High doses of RO 5-3663 or picrotoxin also reversed the anti-conflict action of valproate. Bicuculline did not change the effects of valproate in this test situation. The suppressive effect of valproate on locomotor activity was reversed by a low dose (5 mg/kg) of RO 15-1788, but not by the other antagonists. RO 5-3663 was the only antagonist which effectively reversed the muscle relaxant effects of valproate observed in a Rotarod performance test. These findings indicate that various pharmacological actions of valproate may be due to a complex interplay with several sites at the GABA-BDZ-receptor complex.", 
    "40": "Normal sleepers underwent sleep recordings and daytime tests of sleep tendency, performance, and mood while being shifted 180 degrees in their sleep-wake schedule. After two baseline 24-hour periods, subjects postponed sleep until noon. For the next three 24-hour periods, they were in bed from 1200 to 2000 and received triazolam, flurazepam, or placebo at bedtime in parallel groups. Placebo subjects showed significant sleep loss after the shift. Active medication reversed this sleep loss. Despite good sleep, flurazepam subjects appeared most impaired of the three groups on objective assessments of waking function; triazolam subjects were least impaired.", 
    "41": "Low doses of Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 were without effect on variable-interval self-stimulation, but completely abolished the enhancement of responding produced by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Higher doses of Ro 15-1788, unlike other benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, produced an increase in response rates similar to that found after chlordiazepoxide. This result is consistent with its suggested action as a partial agonist. The combination of a high (benzodiazepine-like) dose of Ro 15-1788 with chlordiazepoxide produced a depression of responding similar to that seen with high doses of benzodiazepines. High doses of CGS 8216 produced a depression of self-stimulation, which was not reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Thus, the present procedure is able to distinguish contrasting behavioural effects of benzodiazepine antagonists.", 
    "42": "On the stretch-induced discharge activity of the isolated crayfish sensory neuron flurazepam (less than or equal to 3 X 10(-4) M) and Ro 15-1788 (less than or equal to 10(-3) M) produced reversible concentration-dependent excitation, but oxazepam only produced depression (less than or equal to 5 X 10(-4) M). Similar divergent effects on the membrane properties were observed. Oxazepam increased the threshold to firing without changing resting potential, membrane resistance or the GABA-mediated IPSP. In contrast flurazepam and Ro 15-1788 produced a concentration-dependent decrease in threshold. Flurazepam did not alter membrane resistance or resting potential but facilitated GABA transmission. Ro 15-1788 had the opposite effect on the GABA synapse, and also depolarized the resting potential but did not alter membrane resistance. The change in spike threshold appeared to be an important component in producing discharge excitation or depression. These results not only demonstrate the capability of the sensory neuron to discriminate between structures of benzodiazepines, but also that these agents can produce divergent effects on synaptic and non-synaptic properties of a single neuron.", 
    "43": "The antagonistic and intrinsic activity of an imidazodiazepine derivative, Ro 15-1788, was manifested on the crossed extensor reflex. Ro 15-1788 antagonized the depressant effect of diazepam and shifted the dose-response curve of diazepam to the right in a parallel manner but could not reverse the depression produced by either phenobarbital or chlorpromazine. Ro 15-1788 also antagonized the enhancement produced by ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. When administered alone, Ro 15-1788 showed a weak depressant effect. Thus, Ro 15-1788 seems to be a partial agonist on the benzodiazepine receptors with weak intrinsic activity and pharmacological properties differing from those of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate.", 
    "44": "Rats implanted with electrodes for polygraphic recordings were injected with diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or midazolam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and recorded for 6 h during the 8 h of darkness of a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. The results show that administration of diazepam reduced SWS1 latency by 92%, and increased SWS1 and total sleep by 255% and 59%, respectively, in comparison to control. Administration of midazolam increased SWS1 by 158% and total sleep by 57% when compared to control. These findings correlate well with the effects of benzodiazepines on sleep stage 2 in humans and indicate that benzodiazepine hypnotics increase only the behaviorally lighter stage of SWS in rats as well as in human subjects.", 
    "45": "A gamma-aminobutyrate/benzodiazepine receptor complex has been purified from bovine cerebral cortex by an improved procedure using a zwitterionic detergent. A high affinity binding site for the chloride ion channel-blocking ligand [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate ( TBPS ) was co-purified with the high affinity binding sites for gamma-aminobutyrate and benzodiazepines. The latter two have previously been shown to reside on the same physical structure ( Sigel , E., Stephenson , F.A., Mamalaki , C., and Barnard , E. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6965-6971). The dissociation constants, as measured in assay medium containing zwitterionic detergent were 90 +/- 20 nM for TBPS and 11 +/- 4 nM for [3H]flunitrazepam, whereas the binding of [3H]muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyrate agonist, showed a more complex binding behavior with more than one site. If the same preparation was assayed in a medium containing instead Triton X-100 as the detergent, the binding of TBPS was strongly inhibited, [3H]flunitrazepam binding was unaffected, and [3H]muscimol bound to a single class of sites with a dissociation constant of 33 +/- 3 nM. Regulatory interactions were retained in the complex isolated by the improved method: [3H]flunitrazepam binding was stimulated by gamma-aminobutyrate or by pentobarbital, and in a dose-dependent manner. The same two subunit types of Mr = 53,000 and 57,000 are present in the purified receptor complex as previously reported.", 
    "46": "The effect of diazepam was tested on self-stimulation (SS) in 21 mice implanted with a bipolar electrode in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the dorsolateral hippocampus (HPC) or the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). Diazepam, injected i.p. in doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg, significantly increased SS rates with electrodes in LH while 4 and 8 mg/kg of diazepam had no significant effect. At low doses, similar increases were seen in mice with LEC electrodes but high doses produced a significant suppression. HPC animals showed an almost total suppression of SS beginning at 2 mg/kg of diazepam; lower doses had no significant effect. The results indicate that entorhinal and hippocampal SS are at least partly independent phenomena; in addition, the suppression of SS by moderate doses of diazepam remains specific to the HPC among the brain structures studied to date.", 
    "47": "The annual number of deaths in England and Wales associated with poisoning by solids and liquids over the 8-year period between 1973 and 1980 has remained fairly constant with an average of 2897. Marked trends in the number of deaths associated with specific drugs are evident and apparently reflect prescription trends and drug availability. Barbiturate poisonings dropped steadily following the downward trend in barbiturate prescriptions. Deaths associated with dextropropoxyphene, paracetamol and certain benzodiazepines increased dramatically.", 
    "48": "A capillary gas chromatography column directly interfaced to a mass spectrometer was used for the analysis of sixteen benzodiazepines. The thermal stability of the drugs was found to be related to their chemical structure. Nine of the benzodiazepines were thermally unstable indicating that care should be taken in the interpretation of gas chromatographic data from this class of drugs. The unstable benzodiazepines were: ketazolam which decomposes to diazepam; N-4 oxides (chlordiazepoxide and demoxepam) which lose an oxygen radical; aromatic 7-nitro compounds (nitrazepam and clonazepam) which are partially reduced to the corresponding amine; alpha-hydroxy ketones (lorazepam and oxazepam) which decompose with the loss of water and N-methyl-alpha-hydroxy ketones (lormetazepam and temazepam) which partially decompose with the loss of a hydrogen molecule to produce the corresponding alpha, beta-diketones. Few problems were encountered in distinguishing the drugs by their mass spectra, the exceptions being ketazolam which decomposes to diazepam and demoxepam which decomposes to desmethyldiazepam. In general, good spectra were obtained from 20-50 ng of drug injected. However, for those compounds where the decompositions were not quantitative (nitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, temazepam) detection limits were poor.", 
    "49": "In a randomised cross-over trial, midazolam, a new water soluble benzodiazepine was compared with the conventional diazepam preparation (Valium) in 34 patients aged 16-45 years who were undergoing outpatient conservation dentistry. Midazolam hydrochloride (0.17 mg/kg) was virtually free of venous complications and showed advantages over diazepam (0.32 mg/kg) in providing a faster onset of action, higher incidence of amnesia and more rapid recovery. Midazolam produced a higher incidence of respiratory side effects hiccough (17.6% compared with 2.9%), brief apnoea following induction (11.8% compared with 5.8%), and airway obstruction during maintenance (8.8% compared with 0%). These may be related to the greater potency of midazolam as suggested by the smaller total dose required. Cardiovascular changes and operating conditions were similar.", 
    "50": "To investigate whether it is indicated to make a shift to bilateral technique when the first 6-10 unilateral ECT treatments have produced no improvement in patients with endogenous depression, a retrospective study was made concerning 61 patients 34 of whom (group U) continued with unilateral treatment while in 27 (group UB) a shift was made to bilateral technique. No significant differences were found between the groups with regard to final therapeutic result, only a tendency to better effect in the first mentioned group. This tendency can be explained by the somewhat higher age in this group. The duration of seizures, administration of benzodiazepines, as well as treatment with antidepressive drugs, were equal in the groups, which were thus comparable. It is concluded that since bilateral ECT may severely impair memory for weeks or months the patients should not be stressed by a change to this technique.", 
    "51": "Midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, was compared with thiopentone as an induction agent prior to inhalational anaesthesia. Induction time, cardiovascular response and venous sequelae were studied in 100 healthy in-patients randomly divided into two groups. Midazolam proved to be a good alternative to thiopentone, the longer induction time being compensated by a lower incidence and duration of apnoea.", 
    "52": "Since diazepam is metabolized by many organs in the rat, the microsomal fractions of the liver, kidney, and lung from male Wistar rats were assayed for NADPH-dependent metabolism of diazepam and enzymatic parameters. The predicted extraction ratios were obtained from this in vitro experimental system. The organ clearances of the liver, kidney, and lung were then calculated for the determination of the relative contribution of each eliminating organ to the total body clearance (CLtot) of diazepam in the rat. The liver was the most effective eliminating organ, followed by the kidney and the lung, in that order. The hepatic extraction ratio of diazepam was determined in vivo after portal and femoral vein administrations of diazepam. The validity of the in vitro experimental system for the liver was demonstrated by a good agreement between the calculated hepatic extraction ratio of diazepam from in vitro enzymatic parameters (0.616) and that derived in vivo (0.648). However, the sum of organ clearances of the liver, kidney, and lung did not account for CLtot of diazepam in the rat, suggesting the possible contribution of the metabolism in the other organs or tissues, or an underestimation of the pulmonary and renal metabolism.", 
    "53": "Two cases in which dermal absorption of promethazine hydrochloride resulted in a toxic neurologic syndrome are reported. The symptoms included central nervous system depression, acute excitomotor manifestations, ataxia and visual hallucinations. In addition, peripheral anticholinergic effects occurred. These symptoms are comparable with those of oral, intramuscular and rectal overdose of promethazine. The demonstrated risks of the topical use of promethazine outweigh any benefits.", 
    "54": "Unlabeled diazepam of 0.9 mg/kg was administered i.p. to the rat of 21 days of age with a trace amount of [N-methyl-3H] diazepam and the drug concentrations in the blood and the brain tissues were determined at various time intervals. A two-compartment open model was applied and the absorption and distribution rate constants were distinctly determined on the theoretical basis established in the present study with the aid of a computer. The specific rate constants for absorption, distribution (k12 and k21) and elimination were 0.158, 0.015 and 0.136 and 0.013/min, respectively. A full description of the drug concentration in the central compartment as a function of time enabled us to calculate directly the transfer rate constants between the blood and the brain (k'12 and k'21), resulting in 4.49 and 2.66/min on the average of the five regions in the brain. A time-dependent change of the rate constants through the blood-brain barrier was suggested from a computer simulation.", 
    "55": "The effects of atropine i.v. on inspired volume and occlusion pressure were measured in three groups of patients. Group PE received premedication with pethidine 50 mg and promethazine 12.5 mg i.m., and anaesthesia was provided by 2% enflurane in 67% nitrous oxide. Group TE received temazepam 20 mg orally for premedication and similar anaesthesia. Group TH received temazepam premedication and 1% halothane in 67% nitrous oxide. Atropine 0.02 mg kg-1 i.v. increased significantly the inspiratory flow in the first 1 s of inspiration, and this effect was greater in the group that received pethidine (9% increase in flow). However, occlusion pressure did not change, and minute volume was not altered. The results suggest that atropine increases inspiratory flow after pethidine premedication without increasing the force developed during inspiration, possibly by bronchodilatation.", 
    "56": "Twenty-one episodes of status epilepticus (SE) were each treated with 1 to 9 mg (mean, 4 mg) of intravenous lorazepam. All patients with generalized tonic-clonic ( GTC ) SE responded within 15 minutes. Nine (82%) of the 11 patients with episodes of partial SE with altered responsiveness responded poorly. Respiratory depression occurred in five instances (two requiring intubation) and was associated with transient loss of brain-stem reflexes, hypotension, and decorticate posturing in three cases. Generalized tonic-clonic SE was transformed into partial SE with altered responsiveness in three patients. In an additional four patients, marked lethargy developed. Lorazepam appears effective in controlling GTC SE but only occasionally effective in partial SE with altered responsiveness.", 
    "57": "Many benzodiazepines of the type whose receptors are found in peripheral tissues cause the differentiation of cultured Friend erythroleukemia cells. The maximal level of induction of hemoglobin synthesis is 10-80% of the cells, depending on the compound tested. The induction is concentration and time dependent, requiring micromolar amounts of the drugs and about 5 days of treatment for full expression. The time course is very similar to that observed for a well-studied inducer, dimethyl sulfoxide. The affinities of the agents for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site are not correlated with their capacity to induce differentiation. Also, the biological effect is stereospecific since the (3S) stereoisomer Ro11 -6896 is at least an order of magnitude more potent than its (3R) enantiomer, Ro11 -6893. The benzodiazepine effect exhibits definite structure-activity relationships. A 1-methyl group is an absolute requirement, although this is not sufficient in itself. Hydroxyl and methoxyl groups at the 4' position enhance the biological activity, but 4'-chloro decreases it. Substitutions at the 2', 6', and 4 positions also decrease the biological activity, as does the lack of a 2-carbonyl group. These data suggest that the benzodiazepines act in a specific manner to induce the differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells.", 
    "58": "Certain tricyclic drugs, some of which are primarily used clinically as antidepressants, have been shown to act as gastric antisecretory agents. The anatomical site(s) and mechanism(s) of action of these agents is, however, in most cases unclear. In this study, we found that desmethylimipramine (DMI) was approximately 28 times more potent in inhibiting gastric acid secretion when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.) than when administered intravenously (i.v.) in pylorus-ligated rats, which is indicative of a site of action in the central nervous system. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with pirenzepine where the i.c./i.v. potency ratio was 8. Doxepin also preferentially inhibited acid secretion when given i.c. at low but not at high doses. Atropine and chlorpromazine were equipotent antisecretory agents by both routes of administration. Doxepin and DMI but not pirenzepine were effective inhibitors of brain stem norepinephrine uptake in vitro thus making this an unlikely common mechanism to explain the central actions of these compounds.", 
    "59": "In this study we evaluated the effects of an oral combination therapy with cimetidine and pirenzepine on plasma parathyroidhormone (PTH) and calcitonin (CT) levels in 24 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (mean age: 50 years; mean duration of dialysis treatment: 23 months). As compared to the pre-treatment plasma levels of PTH and CT, there were no significant changes of their plasma concentrations during a 4-week administration of 800 mg cimetidine or 100 mg pirenzepine daily, and the concentrations also did not change significantly during the following 4 weeks of combination therapy with cimetidine and pirenzepine in the above mentioned dosage. Serum concentrations of calcium and phosphate and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase showed no significant changes either. Therefore, we suggest that this therapeutic approach cannot be considered for the treatment of uremic hyperparathyroidism.", 
    "60": "The effects of pirenzepine and atropine on gastric emptying, gastric secretion and heart rate were studied in rats. Both drugs inhibited gastric emptying and secretion dose dependently and increased pulse rate. In the gastric secretory studies both compounds displayed potencies which were not very dissimilar (ID50 were 8.1 mumol X kg-1 and 1.4 mumol X kg-1 for pirenzepine and atropine respectively, potency ratio 6); pirenzepine was however decidedly less potent than atropine in inhibiting gastric emptying (potency ratio 36 on a molar basis) and in increasing heart rate (potency ratio 125). These data, in accordance with results of clinical trials, indicate that pirenzepine-unlike atropine-can inhibit acid secretion without appreciably affecting gastric motility and cardiac function.", 
    "61": "The effects of some antimuscarinic compounds on oxotremorine-induced gastric damage, the pupil size and the pupillary light reflex have been studied in the rat. Unlike atropine, propantheline and methylscopolamine, pirenzepine is effective in preventing gastric erosions at doses much lower than those that affect pupillary reflex.", 
    "62": "In animal behavioral tests of anxiolytic efficacy, TVX Q 7821 was active and equipotent with diazepam, but did not produce muscle relaxation or anti-convulsant effects. The high affinity, specific binding of 3H-TVX Q 7821 to calf hippocampal membranes was displaced by serotonin (5-HT) but not by diazepam. Similarly, unlabeled TVX Q 7821 displaced 3H-5-HT but not 3H-flunitrazepam binding. Since ketanserin (a putative 5-HT2 ligand) was equally weak in displacing labeled 5-HT or TVX Q 7821, TVX Q 7821 may preferentially bind to 5-HT1, receptors.", 
    "63": "Experiments were made to study the effect of a typical (chlorodiasepoxide) and an atypical (lithonite) tranquilizers on the structure and function of mitochondria in emotional-painful stress. It was demonstrated that emotional-painful stress gives rise to the disturbance of the activity of mitochondrial enzymes responsible for tissue respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. This is accompanied by an increase in the relative volume of the mitochondria, their swelling, diminution in the number of crysts and by their fragmentation. As shown by the data of fluorescent studies, the intermolecular relations of the mitochondrial membranes get disturbed, which is likely to be a reason for a change in the activity of mitochondrial enzymes. Lithonite made the activity of the enzymes and the structure of the mitochondria return to normal and stabilized membrane permeability. Chlorodiasepoxide did not exert any such action on the majority of indicators under study.", 
    "64": "Various derivatives of 2-amino-6- methylthiopurine with substituents at the 6-position of purine were tested for their abilities to displace [3H]diazepam binding to rat brain membranes. The potency was dependent on the carbon chain-length in the 6-position of purine. Among the derivatives tested, 2-amino-6-n- pentyldithiopurine had the highest potency, with a Ki value of 0.92 microM.", 
    "65": "Intravenous midazolam was tried as a hypnotic agent for induction of anesthesia in 63 surgical patients. Three dosages were used: 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg body weight. Indices of induction, changes of vital parameters, incidence of apnea and side effects and the duration of the drug effect on central nervous system functions were evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the effects of the different doses of midazolam on the cardiac and respiratory parameters. The drug provided a satisfactory degree of sleep in all patients of maximal intensity at three minutes but anesthetic induction was not achieved in several patients of each dose group (overall failure rate 11%). A short-lasting apnea was seen in 13% of the patients and seemed not related to the administered dose of midazolam. The awareness of the surroundings was satisfactorily obtunded by the anti-recall effect of the drug. The sedative effects of midazolam on central nervous system functions lasted fairly long. Indeed, mental arousal, sensory functions and muscle tone still had not returned to preinjection values 20 min after midazolam administration. A reliable relationship between dose of midazolam and intensity of cerebral depressive effect was not evident.", 
    "66": "In a 20 year old female nurse prolonged recovery (4 hours) unexpectedly followed to Rohypnol intoxication, the oral intake of which was realised only in the later period of postanaesthetic coma. Naloxone and physostigmine failed to achieve improvement but 4-aminopyridine was immediately successful.", 
    "67": "The discharge of cerebellar neurons was investigated in the rabbit and the rat under the influence of pentobarbital, diazepam or medazepam. In the rabbit, these drugs are known to induce a rhythm ranging between 4 and 25 Hz in the red nucleus (RN) and the cerebellum (Cb). Purkinje cells (P cells) in the intermediate zone of the cerebellar cortex as well as neurons of the interposed nucleus (IPN) were found to discharge with burst patterns fully synchronized with the drug-induced RN rhythm. In contrast, P cells in the medial cerebellar zone responded to these drugs only with changes in their discharge rate. Since P cells of the intermediate longitudinal zone project to the RN mainly via the IPN, the present findings complement our previous results, indicating that the rhythmic electrical activity in the RN is initiated by the cerebellum. The three drugs had similar effects on the activity of cerebellar units in the rabbit and the rat. The investigation also shows that, in spite of the uniform morphological structure of the cerebellar cortex, P cells do not respond uniformly to a given drug: the diversity of findings published on the P cell response to barbiturates or benzodiazepine derivatives may be explained by differences in the recording sites.", 
    "68": "In vitro and in vivo experiments were employed in the screening of potential anthelmintic agents against Opisthorchis viverrini infection in hamsters. A few selected groups of compounds tested included those that are commercially available as well as those that are still being tested by various pharmaceutical firms. The compounds tested in the present study were praziquantel, amoscanate, albendazole, flubendazole, metrifonate, metronidazole and benzodiazepine derivatives. Results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that at the dosages employed, praziquantel was the only one that gave complete cure, as judged from faecal egg examination and worm recovery at the time of sacrifice. It was therapeutically effective against different developmental stages of O. viverrini including the metacercariae. Moreover, the drug was also effective as a chemoprophylactic agent when given 6 to 12 hr prior to being exposed to infective metacercariae. Other compounds tested were considerably less active although some might have permanently damaged the fluke reproductive capacity, while others were able to suppress egg-laying capacity only temporarily. Together, results suggests that the ineffectiveness of most agents tested in this study is not related to their inability to attain concentrations high enough to kill or damage the flukes in the biliary system but is most likely due the inherent lack of capacity to kill the flukes.", 
    "69": "Chlordiazepoxide's interaction with ethanol (5% v/v) intake was assessed in rats on a feeding regimen producing high daily quantities of ethanol intake (schedule-induction procedure with intermittent feeding), more moderate amounts of ethanol intake (a single daily feeding), and small amounts of ethanol intake (free feeding). Six days of twice daily sham injections (IP) were followed by 12 days of 0 (vehicle), 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg (twice daily) chlordiazepoxide, and finally six days of the saline (vehicle) injections. Rats in the intermittent feeding daily consumed 9.9-12.3 g/kg (80-95 ml) of ethanol on baseline which was reduced 15 to 33% by the drug. In the single feed condition most rats were drinking 70 to 85 ml (8.8-10.3 g/kg) of ethanol and this was reduced 15-40% by the drug. During the six days after drug, intake in both of these feeding regimens returned to the baseline level. Ethanol intake of rats under the free feeding condition (48 ml, 3.5 g/kg on average) was not affected by the drug, nor was water intake under any of the three feeding regimens.", 
    "70": "The effects of low doses of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) on exploratory behaviour and locomotor activity in the rat, were measured in the holeboard apparatus. PTZ (30 mg/kg) significantly reduced exploratory head-dipping, an effect that was significantly reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) and enhanced by RO 15-1788 (20 mg/kg). RO 15-1788 (20 mg/kg) also significantly enhanced the reduction in locomotor activity produced by PTZ (30 mg/kg); although this reduction was not reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) the reduction in locomotor activity with the drug combination was no greater than that with either drug alone. The results are discussed with respect to a coupling between the benzodiazepine receptors and the site at which PTZ acts.", 
    "71": "Ethanol-induced sedation in Sprague-Dawley rats was antagonized by intracisternally administered thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) at a dose as low as 1 microgram. Furthermore, when a dose of 25 micrograms or greater of TRH was combined with ethanol doses above 2 g/kg, the locomotor activity was significantly greater than observed for TRH alone. A dose-related increase in activity was observed when varying doses of ethanol were administered with a constant dose of TRH (100 micrograms). This increase in locomotion induced by the TRH-ethanol combination could not be attributed to a change in TRH concentration, ethanol distribution or to a pituitary action of TRH. Inasmuch as tert-butanol in combination with TRH produced the same effects as ethanol, the hyperactivity does not appear to be associated with acetaldehyde formation. TRH acid and His-Pro-diketopiperazine, metabolites of TRH, did not produce hyperactivity when administered with ethanol, whereas MK-771, a TRH analog, produced a significant increase in locomotion in ethanol-treated rats greater than that for MK-771 alone. Three lines of evidence suggested that the hyperactivity induced by the TRH-ethanol combination could not be attributed to an influence of ethanol on the stimulant effects of TRH. First, pentobarbital- and chlordiazepoxide-induced depression of locomotion was antagonized by TRH (100 micrograms) but, unlike ethanol, locomotor stimulation greater than that for TRH was not observed. Second, behavioral observations did not reveal ethanol altering any effects of TRH that would compete with locomotion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "This ultrafiltration technique allows determination of free drug in 50 microL of serum. We ultrafiltered sera containing the following drugs--valproic acid (and its major metabolites), phenobarbital, diazepam, indomethacin, phenytoin, furosemide, and chloramphenicol--using both the commercially available micropartition system (MPS-1, Amicon), which requires a 200-microL sample, and our modified micro system, which requires only 50 microL. The value for the free fraction of each drug obtained in the two experiments agreed well. The smaller sample requirement makes the micro method particularly suited for pediatric samples and studies on small laboratory animals.", 
    "73": "There have been no controlled therapeutic trials in Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). In 6 patients with RLS, a randomized double-blind cross-over trial vs placebo showed a significant efficacy of clonazepam in improving subjective quality of sleep and leg dysaesthesia. Vibratory stimulation of the leg showed a less pronounced and non-significant effect. Clonazepam is a safe and effective drug for treatment of RLS; however its long-term efficacy needs confirmation.", 
    "74": "The safety and efficacy of lorazepam and hydroxyzine, administered intramuscularly for surgical premedication, were compared in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Ninety patients were given either 0.05 mg/kg of lorazepam (maximum 4 mg), 1.5 mg/kg of hydroxyzine (maximum, 100 mg), or 1 ml of normal saline before surgery. By 60 min after injection, patients given lorazepam or hydroxyzine were significantly (P less than 0.05) more sedated than the placebo-treated patients. The sedative effect of lorazepam lasted longer than that of hydroxyzine. Baseline anxiety scores were low; thus differences in the anxiolytic effect of the test drugs were not detected. Lorazepam-treated patients were consistently less able to recall postinjection events than patients treated with hydroxyzine or placebo. The frequency of injection-site reactions was similar in the three treatment groups. Premedication with lorazepam was considered satisfactory by a higher percentage of patients (77%) than was that with hydroxyzine (62%) or placebo (34%); only lorazepam was considered significantly (P less than 0.005) superior to placebo. The advantages of a longer duration of sedative effect, a greater effect on recall, and higher patient acceptance favor the use of lorazepam over hydroxyzine for surgical premedication.", 
    "75": "In a randomized, crossover design the antiemetic activity of one of the most active single agents, metoclopramide was compared with a combination of dexamethasone and lorazepam. Both regimens were effective, but dexamethasone-lorazepam was significantly better than metoclopramide in preventing (26% versus 13%) or limiting (44% versus 23%) vomiting. Although side effects were more frequent with lorazepam-dexamethasone, the patients generally judged them desirable and overall patient preference was strong (70% versus 12%) for the lorazepam-dexamethasone combination. Patients required supervision and assistance due to lorazepam-induced drowsiness.", 
    "76": "Lorazepam was compared to placebo to assess its control of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and prochlorperazine. The study design was a randomized, double-blind crossover in which three consecutive chemotherapy courses were compared so that each patient acted as his or her own control. Of 107 patients entered, 80 were evaluable for analysis. Lorazepam significantly reduced the severity and duration of nausea, the severity of vomiting, and the number of vomiting episodes when compared to placebo. Anxiety was reduced during lorazepam courses but not significantly when compared to placebo. There was significantly more sedation with lorazepam courses. Overall, patients preferred lorazepam courses although this preference was significant only in the patient subset receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Lorazepam is a useful adjunct to prochlorperazine in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.", 
    "77": "A series of 4,6,7,8- tetrasubstituted 3,4- dihydroquinazolines , quinazolines, quinazolin -2-ones, 1,2,3,4- tetrahydroquinazolin -2-ones, and 5,7,8,9- tetrasubstituted 1,4-benzodiazepines have been synthesized by utilizing the Diels -Alder reaction between furan o-amino nitriles and various alkyl or aryl vinyl ketone dienophiles to obtain the anthranilic acid precursors. All of the newly synthesized target compounds were evaluated in mice for anticonvulsant activity. Pro- and anticonvulsant action was quantified by the timed intravenous pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold method. Selected compounds were also evaluated for benzodiazepine receptor binding properties and in vivo antagonist potential. Although the compounds lack potency, the data suggest that previously inaccessible substituted analogues may be useful to segregate the proconvulsant , anticonvulsant, and antagonist actions of benzodiazepines and quinazolines.", 
    "78": "The chemical topography of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors was investigated in a thoroughly washed cortical membrane preparation of the rat. Chemical modification by several amino- and tyrosyl-selective reagents and the protection from it by direct and allosteric ligands of the GABA-BZ receptor complex were used to identify the residues at the binding sites. Inhibition of specific GABA binding by p-diazobenzenesulfonic acid (DSA), tetranitromethane (TNM), and N-acetylimidazole and the selective and complete protection from it by GABA and muscimol suggest the presence of a tyrosine residue at the GABAA site. TNM, like DSA, selectively decreased the number of the low-affinity GABA receptors, and this could be completely protected only by GABA concentrations that can saturate the low-affinity sites. TNM pretreatment also abolished the muscimol enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding, which suggests that the low-affinity GABA receptor sites are responsible for this enhancement. Inhibition of GABA binding by pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) and the selective protection by GABA and muscimol support the presence of a lysine residue at the GABAA receptor site. Complete and selective protection from diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) inhibition of [3H]diazepam binding by flurazepam suggests the presence of a histidine residue at the BZ site. Flurazepam selectively protected from inhibition of [3H]diazepam binding by N-bromosuccinimide and N-acetylimidazole, but not that by DSA and TNM, which does not allow a unanimous conclusion regarding the presence of tyrosine or tryptophan residues at the BZ site.", 
    "79": "Rat brain frontal cortex or striatal slices preincubated with 3H-serotonin were superfused with physiological salt solution and tritium overflow was evoked by electrical field stimulation at a frequency of 3 Hz. 1. GABA 1 mmol/1 inhibited the evoked overflow from frontal cortex slices by about 30%. The inhibitory effect was abolished when the frequency of electrical stimulation was 10 instead of 3 Hz. Progabide and R(-)-baclofen were more potent, whereas muscimol was less potent than GABA itself in inhibiting the evoked overflow; the IC15 values of progabide, R(-)-baclofen, GABA and muscimol were 8.3, 15, 170 and greater than 320 mumol/1, respectively. S(+)-baclofen behaved as a partial agonist with a maximum inhibitory effect by about 15%. Nipecotic acid and aminooxyacetic acid were ineffective. The same held true for bicuculline, picrotoxin and diazepam. 2. Bicuculline, picrotoxin, diazepam, phentolamine and the serotonin receptor antagonist metitepin did not influence the inhibitory effect of GABA. By contrast, S(+)-baclofen attenuated the effects of GABA and R(-)-baclofen. 3. The evoked overflow from striatal slices was inhibited by GABA and progabide (IC15 values: 480 and 13 mumol/1, respectively). Nipecotic acid was ineffective. The results suggest that exogenous GABA inhibits serotonin release in the rat brain via GABAB receptors which may be assumed to be located presynaptically.", 
    "80": "The hemodynamic effects of diazepam (0.2 mg/kg)--vecuronium (0.2 mg/kg)--fentanyl (10 micrograms/kg) sequence was investigated when used for induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation in eleven patients undergoing CABG. The parameters monitored included HR, SBP, PAP and PCWP. Also, EKG was monitored via a modified V5 lead and C.O was measured by thermodilution. SVR, PVR and SV were computed from the measured parameters. Following induction of anesthesia by diazepam-vecuronium-fentanyl sequence, there was a decrease in SBP by 20.0% (P less than 0.05), in HR by 15.7% (P less than 0.001) in C.O by 13.3% (P less than 0.01) and in SVR by 13.6% (P less than 0.05) of control value. There were no changes in PAP, PCWP, PVR and SV. Coronary perfusion pressure and heart rate product were both decreased following this induction sequence. However, the percentage decrease in PR was higher than that of CPP, affecting favorably the myocardial oxygen supply-demand balance. Orotracheal intubation was followed by an increase of HR by 10.7% (P less than 0.05), SVR by 13% (P less than 0.05) and PCWP by 26% (P less than 0.05) of preceding value. However, all these values did not reach the control awake values. It was concluded that diazepam (0.2 mg/kg)--vecuronium (0.2 mg/kg)--fentanyl (10 micrograms/kg) sequence does not produce serious hemodynamic changes when used for induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "81": "A review is given of the pharmacodynamic effects of Ketamine and the commonly used Benzodiazepines especially regarding the clinical application of the substances in combination as socalled ataranalgesia. The literature as well as own experimental results show the advantages of ataranalgetic combinations for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Special comment is given for new results about the reversal of hypnotic action by means of 4-aminopyridine."
