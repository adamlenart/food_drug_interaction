    "1": "The objective of the study is to assess adverse events and clinical outcomes of flumazenil administration in known and suspected BZD overdose in an ED at a tertiary academic medical center.", 
    "2": "This is a retrospective observational study of adult patients administered flumazenil for known or suspected BZD overdose in the ED over 7 years. Outcomes included mental status improvement, the incidence of seizures, and intubation of the trachea after flumazenil administration.", 
    "3": "Twenty-three patients were included in the analysis, of which 15 (65%) of patients experienced some type of clinically significant mental status improvement. No seizures were identified despite 7 (35%) reported proconvulsant coingestants. One patient required intubation of the trachea but was subsequently extubated in the ED.", 
    "4": "A majority of patients had improved mental status after the administration of flumazenil. No patient experienced seizures. Additional studies that clarify the role of flumazenil for ED patients with suspected BZD toxicity are warranted.", 
    "5": "Violent patients in the prehospital environment pose a threat to health care workers tasked with managing their medical conditions. While research has focused on methods to control the agitated patient in the emergency department (ED), there is a paucity of data looking at the optimal approach to subdue these patients safely in the prehospital setting. Hypothesis This study evaluated the efficacy of two different intramuscular medications, midazolam and haloperidol, to determine their efficacy in sedating agitated patients in the prehospital setting.", 
    "6": "This was a prospective, randomized, observational trial wherein agitated patients were administered intramuscular haloperidol or intramuscular midazolam to control agitation. Agitation was quantified by the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). Paramedics recorded the RASS and vital signs every five minutes during transport and again upon arrival to the ED. The primary outcome was mean time to achieve a RASS less than +1. Secondary outcomes included mean time for patients to return to baseline mental status and adverse events.", 
    "7": "Five patients were enrolled in each study group. In the haloperidol group, the mean time to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 was 24.8 minutes (95% CI, 8-49 minutes), and the mean time for the return of a normal mental status was 84 minutes (95% CI, 0-202 minutes). Two patients required additional prehospital doses for adequate sedation. There were no adverse events recorded in the patients administered haloperidol. In the midazolam group, the mean time to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 was 13.5 minutes (95% CI, 8-19 minutes) and the mean time for the return of normal mental status was 105 minutes (95% CI, 0-178 minutes). One patient required additional sedation in the ED. There were no adverse events recorded among the patients administered midazolam.", 
    "8": "Midazolam and haloperidol administered intramuscularly appear equally effective for sedating an agitated patient in the prehospital setting. Midazolam appears to have a faster onset of action, as evidenced by the shorter time required to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 in the patients who received midazolam. Haloperidol offers an alternative option for the sedation of an agitated patient. Further studies should focus on continued investigation into appropriate sedation of agitated patients in the prehospital setting.", 
    "9": "Obesity represents one of the most important public health issues according to the World Health Organization. Additionally, in a recent National Health and Nutrition Survey of 2011-2012, approximately 17 % of children and adolescents in the United States were considered obese. The obesity rate is higher within the adolescent age group as compared to preschool children. Childhood obesity is particularly problematic, because the co-morbid disease states which accompany obesity may require frequent pharmacotherapy and/ or surgical intervention. Despite the potential for increased pharmacotherapy among obese patients, there is a paucity of dosing guidelines for this special population. Optimal drug dosing in obese pediatric patients has not been sufficiently explored as the present data available are mostly specific for obese adults. In this review, we present an overview concerning what is currently known about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of frequently used drugs including midazolam, fentanyl and its newer derivatives, morphine, ketamine, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and enoxaparin in obese adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery. We will also summarize the current dosing recommendations of anesthetic drugs in bariatric anesthesia.", 
    "10": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are the drugs of choice to prevent the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Various treatment protocols are published and have been shown to be effective in both office-managed and facility-managed treatment of AWS. The aim of this scientific commentary is to demonstrate the differences in the expected exposure to BDZs during AWS treatment using different treatment regimens available in the literature, in patients with or without alcoholic liver cirrhosis.", 
    "11": "Diazepam and lorazepam AWS protocols were examined and reviewed in the literature, and blood plasma levels were examined and compared, respectively.", 
    "12": "Considerable variation in the blood levels with the different dosing schedules was found. Because the drugs are metabolized differently, we have also shown that liver disease affects the blood levels of diazepam, but not of lorazepam.", 
    "13": "Differences in treatment regimens, the choice of BDZ, as well as the presence of liver cirrhosis can substantially alter the exposure of patients to drugs used for AWS treatment. Outpatient treatment of AWS has been shown to be relatively safe and effective for the treatment of AWS but patients should be carefully monitored.", 
    "14": "Neuroinflammation is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of Schizophrenia (SCZ). In addition, there is increasing evidence for a relationship between the dose and duration of antipsychotic drug (APD) treatment and reductions in grey matter volume. The potential contribution of microglia to these phenomena is however not yet defined. Adult rats were treated with a common vehicle, haloperidol (HAL, 2 mg/kg/day) or olanzapine (OLZ, 10 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks via an osmotic mini-pump implanted subcutaneously. Microglial cells, identified by their Iba-1 immunoreactivity, were quantified in four regions of interest chosen based on previous neuroimaging data: the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, corpus striatum, and secondary somatosensory cortex. Those cells were also analysed according to their morphology, providing an index of their activation state. Chronic APD treatment resulted in increased density of total microglia in the hippocampus, striatum, and somatosensory cortex, but not in the ACC. Importantly, in all brain regions studied, both APD tested led to a dramatic shift towards an amoeboid, reactive, microglial morphology after chronic treatment compared to vehicle-treated controls. These data provide the first in vivo evidence that chronic APD treatment at clinically relevant doses leads to microglial proliferation and morphological changes indicative of activated microglia in the na\u00efve rat brain. Although caution needs to be exerted when extrapolating results from animals to patients, these data suggest a potential contribution of antipsychotic medication to markers of brain inflammation. Further investigation of the links between antipsychotic treatment and the immune system are warranted.", 
    "15": "Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can lead to severe morbidity and potentially be fatal if untreated. A subgroup of patients treated for alcohol withdrawal symptoms will exhibit symptoms resistant to first-line treatment with benzodiazepines. The understanding of benziodiazepine-resistant alcohol withdrawal symptoms has increased with new knowledge of implicated neuroreceptors and possible treatment methods. This article aims to elucidate the patient population and the existing methods of treatment.", 
    "16": "It has been proposed that spontaneous panic attacks are the outcome of the misfiring of an evolved suffocation alarm system. Evidence gathered in the last years is suggestive that the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) in the midbrain harbors a hypoxia-sensitive suffocation alarm system. We here investigated whether facilitation of 5-HT-mediated neurotransmission within the dPAG changes panic-like defensive reactions expressed by male Wistar rats submitted to a hypoxia challenge (7% O2), as observed in other animal models of panic. Intra-dPAG injection of 5-HT (20 nmol), (\u00b1)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) (8 nmol), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, or (\u00b1)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo amphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) (16 nmol), a preferential 5-HT2A agonist, reduced the number of upward jumps directed to the border of the experimental chamber during hypoxia, interpreted as escape attempts, without affecting the rats' locomotion. These effects were similar to those caused by chronic, but not acute, intraperitoneal administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine (5-15 mg/kg), or acute systemic administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist alprazolam (1-4 mg/kg), both drugs clinically used in the treatment of panic disorder. Our findings strengthen the view that the dPAG is a key encephalic area involved in the defensive behaviors triggered by activation of the suffocation alarm system. They also support the use of hypoxia-evoked escape as a model of respiratory-type panic attacks.", 
    "17": "The aim of this study was to examine the role of GABAergic neurotransmission in amygdala nuclei in low- (LR) and high-anxiety (HR) rats after repeated corticosterone administration and acute injection of the benzodiazepine midazolam. The animals were divided into LR and HR groups based on the duration of their conditioned freezing in a contextual fear test (CFT). Repeated daily administration of corticosterone (20\u00a0mg/kg s.c.) for 21 injections increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field and reduced body weight in both the LR and HR groups. These effects of corticosterone administration were more pronounced in the HR group. Moreover, in the HR group, chronic corticosterone administration increased the duration of freezing in the CFT test compared with the appropriate control group and treated LR rats. The behavioral effects in HR rats were accompanied by an increase in the expression of c-Fos in the lateral (LA) and central (CeA) nuclei of the amygdala and by a decrease in GABA-A alpha-2 subunit density in the CeA. Acute midazolam administration significantly attenuated the neophobia and conditioned fear responses, decreased c-Fos expression in the LA and CeA, and increased alpha-2 subunit density in the CeA only in the HR group. These studies have shown that HR rats are more susceptible to the anxiogenic effects of chronic corticosterone administration, which are associated with the attenuation of GABAergic control over the amygdala output that controls emotional responses. The current data may increase understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for individual differences in the psychopathological processes induced by repeated administration of high doses of glucocorticoids or by elevated levels of these hormones, which are associated with chronic stress and affective pathology.", 
    "18": "Levomilnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with balanced potency for the reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin, approved in the USA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. We conducted studies in healthy human subjects to investigate pharmacokinetic interactions when levomilnacipran extended-release (ER) is administered in combination with an inhibitor (ketoconazole), an inducer (carbamazepine), or a substrate (alprazolam) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.", 
    "19": "Randomised, open-label studies were conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 34 ketoconazole, n = 34 carbamazepine, n = 30 alprazolam) and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined when levomilnacipran was administered alone or together with the relevant study drug.", 
    "20": "Co-administration of ketoconazole with levomilnacipran ER increased levomilnacipran maximum concentration (C max) by 39% [90% confidence interval (CI) 31-47%] and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) by 57% (90% CI 47-67%), whereas carbamazepine reduced the C max and AUC of levomilnacipran by 26% (90% CI 22-30%) and 29% (90% CI 26-32%), respectively. Levomilnacipran at steady state had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 1 mg dose of alprazolam extended release (XR); neither did single-dose alprazolam XR affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of levomilnacipran. No new safety concerns were noted in these studies.", 
    "21": "Based on these results, the levomilnacipran ER dose should not exceed 80 mg once daily when used with ketoconazole, compared to 120 mg once daily in the absence of ketoconazole. No dose adjustment for levomilnacipran is suggested when levomilnacipran ER is co-administered with carbamazepine or other CYP3A4 inducers. Co-administration with levomilnacipran of drugs metabolised by CYP3A4, such as alprazolam, requires no dose adjustment due to pharmacokinetic considerations.", 
    "22": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single-step, organic solvent-free supercritical fluid process for the preparation of olanzapine-methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin complexes with an express goal to enhance the dissolution properties of olanzapine. The complexes were prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide processing, co-evaporation, freeze drying and physical mixing. The prepared complexes were then analysed by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, solubility and dissolution studies. Computational molecular docking studies were performed to study the formation of molecular inclusion complexation of olanzapine with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. All the binary mixtures of olanzapine with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, except physical mixture, exhibited a faster and greater extent of drug dissolution than the drug alone. Products obtained by the supercritical carbon dioxide processing method exhibited the highest apparent drug dissolution. The characterisation by different analytical techniques suggests complete complexation or amorphisation of olanzapine and methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin complexes prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide processing method. Therefore, organic solvent-free supercritical carbon dioxide processing method proved to be novel and efficient for the preparation of solid inclusion complexes of olanzapine with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. The preliminary data also suggests that the complexes of olanzapine with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin will lead to better therapeutic efficacy due to better solubility and dissolution properties.", 
    "23": "This work examines the effect of midazolam-induced light sedation on intrinsic functional connectivity of human brain, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, within-subject design. Fourteen healthy young subjects were enrolled and midazolam (0.03 mg/kg of the participant's body mass, to a maximum of 2.5 mg) or saline were administrated with an interval of one week. Resting-state fMRI was conducted before and after administration for each subject. We focus on two types of networks: sensory related lower-level functional networks and higher-order functions related ones. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify these resting-state functional networks. We hypothesize that the sensory (visual, auditory, and sensorimotor) related networks will be intact under midazolam-induced light sedation while the higher-order (default mode, executive control, salience networks, etc.) networks will be functionally disconnected. It was found that the functional integrity of the lower-level networks was maintained, while that of the higher-level networks was significantly disrupted by light sedation. The within-network connectivity of the two types of networks was differently affected in terms of direction and extent. These findings provide direct evidence that higher-order cognitive functions including memory, attention, executive function, and language were impaired prior to lower-level sensory responses during sedation. Our result also lends support to the information integration model of consciousness.", 
    "24": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the number of women recruited for studies to establish the efficacy of medications approved for treatment of alcohol dependence (AD) and of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is sufficient to reveal possible gender differences in the response to these medications and in suggesting the use of different doses in female patients. Our results show that the rates of women recruited for studies evaluating the efficacy of disulfiram (1%), benzodiazepines (3%), and anticonvulsants (13%) were too low to establish possible gender differences. The rates of women recruited for studies evaluating the efficacy of acamprosate (22%), naltrexone (23%), and nalmefene (30%) were higher and allowed evaluation of data obtained for female patients. Women receive medications for treatment of AD and/or AWS for which efficacy has been demonstrated in studies in which men were more largely represented.",

    "27": "Patients in maintenance treatment with buprenorphine with a daily dose of 24 mg were given a triple dose of 72 mg (n = 9), in an outpatient setting. Blood samples were drawn, and withdrawal symptoms were evaluated objectively and subjectively every 24 hours over 72 hours. Urine and blood toxicology samples were obtained.", 
    "28": "The triple dose was generally accepted well with low subjective and objective withdrawal scores. However, two patients aborted the study on day 3 and reported withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepine use was confirmed in one while the other likely used unauthorized buprenorphine.", 
    "29": "Administration of buprenorphine in three times the daily dose seems acceptable, also in the higher daily maintenance doses (here, 24 mg) used in many clinical settings. Two patients did not tolerate the regimen but, partly due to the outpatient setting, the reasons why are unclear. Further research should be of interest as high buprenorphine doses are becoming more common clinically.", 
    "30": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening neurological emergency often refractory to available treatment options. It is a very heterogeneous condition in terms of clinical presentation and causes, which besides genetic, vascular and other structural causes also include CNS or severe systemic infections, sudden withdrawal from benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants and rare autoimmune etiologies. Treatment of SE is essentially based on expert opinions and antiepileptic drug treatment per se seems to have no major impact on prognosis. There is, therefore, urgent need of novel therapies that rely upon a better understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying this clinical condition. Accumulating evidence in animal models highlights that inflammation ensuing in the brain during SE may play a determinant role in ongoing seizures and their long-term detrimental consequences, independent of an infection or auto-immune cause; this evidence encourages reconsideration of the treatment flow in SE patients.", 
    "31": "Status epilepticus (SE) represents the most severe form of epilepsy. It is one of the most common neurologic emergencies, with an incidence of up to 61 per 100,000 per year and an estimated mortality of 20 %. Clinically, tonic-clonic convulsive SE is divided into four subsequent stages: early, established, refractory, and super-refractory. Pharmacotherapy of status epilepticus, especially of its later stages, represents an \"evidence-free zone,\" due to a lack of high-quality, controlled trials to inform clinical decisions. This comprehensive narrative review focuses on the pharmacotherapy of SE, presented according to the four-staged approach outlined above, and providing pharmacological properties and efficacy/safety data for each antiepileptic drug according to the strength of scientific evidence from the available literature. Data sources included MEDLINE and back-tracking of references in pertinent studies. Intravenous lorazepam or intramuscular midazolam effectively control early SE in approximately 63-73 % of patients. Despite a suboptimal safety profile, intravenous phenytoin or phenobarbital are widely used treatments for established SE; alternatives include valproate, levetiracetam, and lacosamide. Anesthetics are widely used in refractory and super-refractory SE, despite the current lack of trials in this field. Data on alternative treatments in the later stages are limited. Valproate and levetiracetam represent safe and effective alternatives to phenobarbital and phenytoin for treatment of established SE persisting despite first-line treatment with benzodiazepines. To date there are no class I data to support recommendations for most antiepileptic drugs for established, refractory, and super-refractory SE. Limiting the methodologic heterogeneity across studies is required and high-class randomized, controlled trials to inform clinicians about the best treatment in established and refractory status are needed.", 
    "32": "Several novel cascade reactions are herein reported that enable access to a variety of unique mono- and bis-heterocyclic scaffolds. The sequence of cascade events are mediated through acid treatment of an Ugi adduct that affords 1,5-benzodiazepines which subsequently undergo an elegant rearrangement to deliver (E)-benzimidazolones, which through acid-promoted tautomerization convert to their corresponding (Z)-isomers. Moreover, a variety of heterocycles tethered to (Z)-benzimidazole-2-ones are also accessible through similar domino-like processes, demonstrating a general strategy to access significantly new scaffold diversity, each containing four points of potential diversification. Final structures of five scaffolds have been definitively proven by X-ray crystallography.",

    "35": "Diazepam with ketamine or propofol was given IV to each of 10 sheep after premedication with SRB (0.01 mg/kg, SC); after > 4 weeks, each sheep received the other induction combination with no premedication. For both eyes, IOPs were measured before premedication (if given), 10 minutes prior to (baseline) and immediately following administration of ketamine or propofol (time of IOA), after endotracheal intubation, and 5 minutes after IOA. Peak end-tidal P(CO2), globe position, and pupillary diameter were also analyzed.", 
    "36": "Data were not available for all sheep for all anesthetic episodes. Propofol-diazepam administration alone had no significant effect on IOP, whereas there was a significant decrease in IOP immediately following ketamine-diazepam administration alone. At 5 minutes after ketamine-diazepam administration, SRB-premedicated sheep had significantly higher IOP than unpremedicated sheep. Intraocular pressure was significantly higher at baseline, at intubation, and 5 minutes after IOA in SRB-premedicated sheep receiving propofol-diazepam, compared with unpremedicated sheep. Peak end-tidal P(CO2) at intubation was significantly higher in SRB-premedicated sheep. For sheep receiving either anesthetic treatment, IOPs did not differ significantly with or without SRB premedication. Globe position or pupillary diameter and IOP were not significantly related at any time point.", 
    "37": "Results suggested that both ketamine-diazepam and propofol-diazepam combinations were suitable for IOA without increasing IOP in sheep. The use of SRB should be avoided in sheep when increases in IOP are undesirable.", 
    "38": "This review provides background information on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) classification and pathophysiology and reviews various antiemetic agents for CINV prophylaxis, including corticosteroids, serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT3 RAs), tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists (NK1 RAs), and olanzapine. Other less commonly used agents are briefly discussed. Practical considerations are reviewed as well, including emetogenicity of chemotherapeutic regimens, patient-specific risk factors for CINV, principles of CINV management, health economics outcome research, and quality of life. Available data on the newly FDA-approved antiemetic combination netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA) is also reviewed. Prevention of CINV is an important goal in managing patients with cancer and is especially difficult with respect to nausea and delayed CINV. Corticosteroids are a mainstay of CINV prophylaxis and are usually given in combination with other therapies. The 5-HT3 RA palonosetron has shown increased efficacy over other agents in the same class for prevention of delayed emesis with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and NK1 RAs improve emesis prevention in combination with 5-HT3 RAs and dexamethasone. Olanzapine has shown efficacy for CINV prophylaxis and the treatment of breakthrough CINV. The new combination therapy, NEPA, has been shown to be efficacious for the prevention of acute, delayed, and overall CINV. Risk factors that have been identified for CINV include gender, age, and alcohol intake. It is important to assess the emetogenicity of chemotherapy regimens as well as the potential impact of patient risk factors in order to provide adequate prophylaxis. Acute and delayed CINV are severe, burdensome side effects of chemotherapy; however, new data on prevention and the discovery of new agents can further improve CINV control.", 
    "39": "Recent studies reported the translocator protein (TSPO) to play critical roles in several kinds of neurological diseases including the inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. This study was undertaken to explore the distribution and possible mechanism of spinal TSPO against chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) in a rat model of L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Our results showed that TSPO was upregulated in a time-related manner in the spinal dorsal horn after SNL. Spinal TSPO was predominately expressed in astrocytes. A single intrathecal injection of TSPO agonist Ro5-4864, but not TSPO antagonist PK11195, alleviated the mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. A single intraspinal injection of TSPO overexpression lentivirus (LV-TSPO), but not TSPO inhibited lentivirus (LV-shTSPO), also relieved the development of CNP. Intrathecal administration of 2 \u03bcg Ro5-4864 on day 3 induced a significant increase of TSPO protein content at the early stage (days 5-7) while inhibited the TSPO activation during the chronic period (days 14-21) compared with the control group. Ro5-4864 suppressed the astrocytes and p-JNK1 activation and decreased the CXCL1 expression in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Ro5-4864 also attenuated the spinal CXCR2 and p-ERK expressions. These results suggested that early upregulation of TSPO could elicit potent analgesic effects against CNP, which might be partly attributed to the inhibition of CXCL1-CXCR2-dependent astrocyte-to-neuron signaling and central sensitization. TSPO signaling pathway may present a novel strategy for the treatment of CNP.", 
    "40": "Zolpidem is a widely used ultrashort-acting non-benzodiazepine in clinical practice; compared with benzodiazepines, it does not have side effects such as daytime hangover, rebound insomnia, and development of tolerance. We report an autopsy case of abnormal behaviour induced by zolpidem. A man in his 60's had suffered from postherpetic neuralgia about 2 months ago and had been prescribed zolpidem for insomnia. According to his family, he had no memory of his actions such as striking a wall, taking his futon outside, and eating 5 times a day after he took zolpidem. Because his postherpetic neuralgia did not improve, he was hospitalized and treated with an epidural block. During hospitalization, he took off his clothes, removed the epidural block catheter by himself, and slept on others' beds. He disappeared from the hospital one day; the next day, he was found dead in a narrow water storage tank 10 km away from the hospital. He was thought to have driven a car by himself to reach the place. Forensic autopsy revealed that the cause of death was drowning. Zolpidem and several other drugs were detected by toxicological analysis of his blood; the concentrations of these drugs were within therapeutic range. There are several reports about somnambulism induced by zolpidem such as sleepwalking, sleep driving, and eating. Considering the strange episodes following zolpidem administration, his behaviour on the day of his death was considered abnormal behaviour induced by zolpidem.", 
    "41": "The French pay-for-performance (P4P) contract CAPI implemented by the national health insurance included a target-goal which aims at reducing benzodiazepines prescriptions.

After controlling for the self-selection bias, the propensity of GPs to achieve the benzodiazepines target is only 0.31\u00a0% higher for signatories than for their non-signing counterparts-estimate for June 2012, which yields a statistically significant gap. Our economic analysis demonstrates that the CAPI contract does not allow savings, but presents in 2012 a NET cost of 93.6\u20ac per avoided benzodiazepines treatment (291\u20ac in 2011).",

Leukemia cells were treated with various concentrations of GSK525762A. The inhibitory effects of BRD4 inhibitor on common B-ALL leukemia cells were measured by CCK-8 assay and the apoptosis of those cells was determined by Annexin\u2164/7-AAD staining using flow cytometry. The transcripts of c-MYC, CDK6 and Bcl-2 were detected by quantitative RT-PCR, and the expression of c-MYC, CDK6 and Bcl-2 proteins were detected via Western blot.",

This issue reviews the pathophysiology of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome, describes the 4 manifestations of alcohol withdrawal, and looks at the available evidence for optimal treatment of alcohol withdrawal in its diverse presentations. Patients commonly manifest hyperadrenergic signs and symptoms, necessitating admission to the intensive care unit, intravenous benzodiazepines, and, frequently, adjunctive pharmacotherapy. An aggressive front-loading approach with benzodiazepines is proposed and the management of benzodiazepine-resistant disease is addressed.", 
    "50": "Quazepam (QZP) is a long-acting benzodiazepine-type hypnotic. We searched for novel QZP metabolites in bile and determined their structures by liquid chromatography-ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-IT-TOF MS). The metabolites were extracted with ethyl acetate after \u03b2-glucuronidase treatment. First, a single MS spectrum was acquired. Second, MS(n) spectra were acquired for peaks that consisted of ions with the isotope pattern corresponding to molecules bearing one chlorine atom. The novel QZP metabolites found in this study were hydroxyquazepam, hydroxy-methoxyquazepam, hydroxy-oxoquazepam, and hydroxy-methoxy-oxoquazepam, which have the hydroxy and methoxy groups on the fluorophenyl group, and dihydroxy-oxoquazepam and dihydroxy-methoxy-oxoquazepam, which have one hydroxy group at the 3-position of the seven-membered ring and the other hydroxy group and the methoxy group on the fluorophenyl group. We demonstrated that LC-IT-TOF MS was a useful tool for determining the structure of the metabolites. However, the exact locations of the hydroxy and methoxy groups on the fluorophenyl group could not be identified.", 
    "51": "Treatment of severe and refractory manic episodes in hospital settings can occasionally be very difficult. In particular, severely excited patients showing aggressive, hostile, impulsive behaviours frequently require physical restraint and seclusion, high doses of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, and sometimes, electroconvulsive therapy. Hospital stay is generally prolonged and such patients cause great emotional distress for other patients in the ward and clinical staff involved in their care. Here we report on three patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and one patient with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder bipolar subtype, all of whom were hospitalized for severe manic episodes with psychotic features. These patients were extremely difficult to manage in the ward as no response could be obtained in the first week of treatment despite high doses of antipsychotics and benzodiazepine administration. The introduction and rapid titration of clozapine proved remarkably effective and was well tolerated in the acute management of these patients. We observed that clozapine had a superior and fast mood stabilization effect with rapid titration and could be extremely helpful in the management of such patients.", 
    "52": "In ancient and current traditional medicine in M\u00e9xico, extracts from the leaves or whole plant of 'life leaf' (Kalanchoe pinnata [K. pinnata]Lam) have been used to treat an entity known locally as 'yellow epilepsy' (alferec\u00eda amarilla) when it is accompanied by seizures. However, the anticonvulsive activity of its stems and roots remains unexplored", 
    "53": "The anticonvulsant activity of the methanolic root extract (MER) or stem (MES) of K. pinnata Lam. was evaluated in a pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure model in Balb/C mice, and effects were compared to those of diazepam. The stem extract fractions that produced anticonvulsant activity were subsequently evaluated using the pentylenetetrazol -induced seizure model.", 
    "54": "We observed increased latency of tonic-clonic seizures that was inversely proportional to the dose of MRE, with a similar impact on the lethal effects of pentylenetetrazol. Different doses of the MSE showed a dose-dependent increase in latency to myoclonus, clonus, and tonic-clonic seizures, acting similarly to diazepam and offering 100% protection against the lethal effects of pentylenetetrazol. Fractioning MSE decreased its effectiveness, but when fractions were mixed with fractions of chloroform and ethyl acetate, anticonvulsive activity was restored. The preliminary phytochemical analysis identified alkaloids and sterols in MRE, and sterols and terpenes in MSE CONCLUSIONS: The anticonvulsant activity of K. pinnata Lam. decreases with increased doses of MRE, whereas the effect of MSE is dose-dependent and preserved in the mixture chloroform and ethyl acetate. We suggest that the metabolites responsible for these effects are sterols in MRE, and sterols and terpenes in MSE.", 
    "55": "The administration of trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE) may cause nausea, shortness of breath, agitation, emotional distress and pain in patients due to pharyngo-esophageal intubation, which may be partially relieved by sedoanalgesia. The aim of this study was to compare clinical effects of midazolam, midazolam-alfentanil combination and propofol sedation given for sedation and sedoanalgesia to patients with planned diagnostic TEE interventions.", 
    "56": "This study was prospectively completed with 90 randomized adult patients in ASA risk groups I-II-III. Group M were given 2.5 mg midazolam, group MA were given 1 mg midazolam and 5 \u03bcg/kg alfentanil and group P were given 0.5 mg/kg propofol intravenous bolus. If necessary, additional doses were administered. Patients administered with TEE were evaluated in terms of additional dose requirements, Ramsey Sedation Scale (RSS), modified Aldrete Scoring (MAS), recovery time and duration of stay in the hospital.", 
    "57": "In the group P additional dose requirements were greater (p<0.05), as well as the duration of stay in the recovery unit and hospital were shorter (p<0.05). On insertion of the TEE probe, the RSS in the group P was clearly higher than in other groups M and MA (p<0.05).", 
    "58": "During the TEE intervention, the use of propofol, contrary to requirements for additional dose and observation of apnea, appears to be advantageous due to providing more rapid and effective sedation depth without a need of expensive antagonist agents, and allowing early discharge of patients. Additionally, it seems that the use of midazolam combined with alfentanil, is more advantageous comparing to midazolam alone.",

SGA type, dose, higher age, and lower baseline functioning were jointly associated with drug-induced parkinsonism (R(2) = 0.18; p < .0001). Controlling for these factors, drug-induced parkinsonism rates were significantly lower only for quetiapine and olanzapine. Subjectively reported EPS (5%), EPS-related treatment discontinuation (3.3%), and anticholinergic initiation (3%) were infrequent. Anticholinergic initiation was most frequent with risperidone (10.2%; p = .0004). Treatment-emergent dyskinesia ranged from 4.5% (aripiprazole) to 15.5% (olanzapine). SGA type, younger age, white race/ethnicity, and baseline AIMS were jointly associated with treatment-emergent dyskinesia (R(2) = 0.31; p < .0001). Controlling for these factors, treatment-emergent dyskinesia rates differed among SGA subgroups, with higher rates with olanzapine and ziprasidone. At baseline, psychostimulant use was associated with dyskinesia, and number of psychotropic comedications was associated with subjective EPS.",

The main problems encountered were by decreasing order of frequency: missing monitoring (15% of the interventions), lack of compliance (13%), over dosage (10%), lack of conformity with recommendations or consensus (8%). Interventions were accepted in 78% cases. Most prescribing errors implied medications of the central nervous system. Among the interventions, 8% were initiated by pharmacy technicians, mainly lack of compliance.", 
    "66": "The pharmaceutical interventions reported reflected actions of securisation initiated by the pharmacists in cooperation with physicians: monitoring of patients taking antipsychotic medications or benzodiazepines maximal dosages. Besides, in this population with a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities and important suicide rate, detection of patients with default of compliance is one of the keys for drug optimization among these patients as it is an explanation for therapeutic failure.",

However, ARHGAP26 is also expressed in some hippocampal neurons. Moreover, some of the previously reported patients showed cognitive and affective symptoms. It is unknown whether those symptoms reflected involvement of the limbic system or were part of the so-called cerebellar cognitive/affective syndrome.",

    "70": "AM-694 or 1-(5-fluoropentyl)-3-(2-iodobenzoyl)indole is a synthetic cannabinoid that acts as a selective and a powerful agonist for CB1 receptor, inducing cannabinoid-like effects (euphoria, sedation, hallucinations and anxiety). Its spread, like for other synthetic cannabinoids, has increased in recent years and many web sources freely supply these kinds of new drugs. It can be taken by smoking or through oral consumption. A 25-years-old man was hospitalized at the local hospital following a major trauma after ingestion of alcohol and an unknown pill. Urine and blood samples were sent to our Forensic Toxicology Division to investigate on possible substance abuse. A general unknown screening of biological samples, extracted by liquid-liquid extraction (ethylacetate and dichloromethane) in basic, acidic and neutral conditions, was achieved to verify the presence of drugs of abuse and/or their metabolites, both in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For the quantification of AM-694, urine was extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) on a Bond Elut Certify cartridge; an acidic hydrolysis (HCl 30%, 95\u00b0C, 60min) was necessary before liquid-liquid extraction of metabolites. For the detection of benzodiazepines and their metabolites, an enzymatic hydrolysis was applied (\u03b2-glucuronidase, pH 4.5, 50\u00b0C, 18h). Quantification of AM-694 (internal standard AM-2201), midazolam and \u03b1-hydroxymidazolam (internal standard halazepam) were performed by LC-MS/MS analysis in multiple reaction monitoring ([M+H](+): m/z 436\u2192190, 272, AM-694; m/z 360\u2192155, 127, AM-2201; m/z 326\u2192291, 223, midazolam; m/z 342\u2192168, 203, \u03b1-hydroxymidazolam; m/z 353\u2192241, 222, halazepam). The general unknown screening revealed the presence of AM-694 (urine sample) and benzodiazepines (urine and blood). The concentration of AM-694, obtained by LC-MS/MS, was 0.084\u03bcg/L. Midazolam and \u03b1-hydroxymidazolam were detected in urine (0.97 and 74.58\u03bcg/L, respectively) and in blood (34.84 and 23.15\u03bcg/L, respectively). Qualitative information about the AM-694 metabolites was obtained by LC-MS/MS in selected-ion monitoring for the putative [M+H](+) ions: m/z 448, carboxylated metabolite; m/z 434, defluorinated metabolite; quantification was not possible since reference standards are not available. Our report is the first case of detection of AM-694 and its metabolites in human biological fluids in Italy. For this reason, this case constitutes a first worrisome alarm about the spread of this substance.",

From July 2013 to March 2015, 1243 cases of suspected NPS intoxication originating from ED or ICU were enrolled in the STRIDA project. During the 21-month period, 56 (4.5%) patients tested positive for 3-MeO-PCP and 11 (0.9%) for 4-MeO-PCP; 8 of these cases involved both substances. The 59 patients were aged 14-55 (median: 26) years and 51 (86%) were men. Co-exposure to other NPSs and/or classical drugs of abuse was common with only 7 cases (12%) indicated to be 3-MeO-PCP single-substance intoxications; prominent clinical signs seen in the latter cases were hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265 140 mmHg; 7 cases), tachycardia (\u2265 100/min; 5 cases), and altered mental status (4 cases) including confusion, disorientation, dissociation, and/or hallucinations. Mixed-drug users displayed not only the same clinical features, but also more sympathomimetic effects including agitation (38%) and dilated pupils (33%). Patients testing positive for 3-/4-MeO-PCP were typically under medical care for 1-2 days (85%), and 37% of all cases were graded as severe intoxications (Poisoning Severity Score 3). Besides standard supportive therapy, 49% of the patients were treated with benzodiazepines and/or propofol.",

The adverse effects noted in cases of acute intoxications involving 3- and/or 4-MeO-PCP resembled those of other dissociatives such as PCP, ketamine, and methoxetamine. However, similar to intoxications involving other NPS, poly-substance use was found to be common.", 
    "76": "This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and antipsychotic activity of olanzapine administered as free drug (OLA-FREE) or loaded into lipid-core nanocapsules (OLA-LNC). OLA-LNC were successfully developed with a particle size of 142 \u00b1 4 nm and a zeta potential of -19.6 \u00b1 0.6 mV. Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution studies were carried out after the administration of free and nanoencapsulated olanzapine (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal route to male Wistar rats. Higher olanzapine concentrations and AUC(0-12 h) were found in plasma and tissues evaluated after the administration of OLA-LNC compared to the drug in the free form, resulting in a relative bioavailability of 226.7% in the plasma. As a result olanzapine loaded lipid-core nanocapsules presented pronounced and long-lasting effects on central nervous system. These nanocapsules (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly diminished the stereotyped behavior induced by D,L-amphetamine up to 12 hours whereas olanzapine free-form (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was effective during 03 hours only. Moreover, olanzapine loaded lipid-core nanocapsules (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) have shown a marked sedative effect and also prevented the prepulse inhibition disruption induced by apomorphine at lower dose than olanzapine in free-form (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Herewith, we point to the nanoencapsulation as a strategy for reducing the concentration of olanzapine in pharmaceutical formulations.", 
    "77": "Nose-to-brain drug delivery has been proposed to overcome the low absorption of drugs in central nervous system due to the absence of brain-blood barrier in the olfactory nerve pathway. However, the presence of a mucus layer and quick clearance limit the use of this route. Herein, amphiphilic methacrylic copolymer-functionalized poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) nanocapsules were proposed as a mucoadhesive system to deliver olanzapine after intranasal administration. In vitro evaluations showed that these nanocapsules were able to interact with mucin (up to 17% of increment in particle size and 30% of reduction of particle concentration) and nasal mucosa (2-fold higher force for detaching), as well as to increase the retention of olanzapine (about 40%) on the nasal mucosa after continuous wash. The olanzapine-loaded amphiphilic methacrylic copolymer-functionalized PCL nanocapsules enhanced the amount of drug in the brain of rats (1.5-fold higher compared to the drug solution). In accordance with this finding, this formulation improved the prepulse inhibition impairment induced by apomorphine, which is considered as an operational measure of pre-attentive sensorimotor gating impairment present in schizophrenia. Besides, nanoencapsulated olanzapine did not affect the nasal mucosa integrity after repeated doses. These data evidenced that the designed nanocapsules are a promising mucoadhesive system for nose-to-brain delivery of drugs.",

Risperidone also exerted a significant prenatal toxicity, but its adverse effect was less pronounced than that induced by olanzapine. Valnoctamide did not show any teratogenic effect, even when used in relatively higher dosages than olanzapine and risperidone. The observed increased skeletal abnormalities in one of the valnoctamide treatment groups were nonspecific and, as such, signaled a modest developmental delay rather than an indication that the compound could induce structural malformations.",

    "92": "Benzodiazepines remain as the first-line treatment for status epilepticus (SE), but debate continues as to the choice and delivery route of pharmacotherapy. Lorazepam is currently the preferred anticonvulsant for clinical use, but midazolam has become a popular alternative, particularly as it can be given by nonintravenous routes. Anticonvulsants are also commonly used to terminate SE in animal models. Here, we aimed to compare the efficacy of midazolam with that of lorazepam in an experimental model of focal-onset SE. Status epilepticus was induced by intra-amygdala microinjection of kainic acid in 8week old C57Bl/6 mice. Forty minutes later, mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of either lorazepam or midazolam (8mg/kg). Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, histology, and behavioral tests assessing recovery of function were evaluated and compared between groups. Intraperitoneal injection of either lorazepam or midazolam resulted in similar patterns of reduced EEG epileptiform activity during 1-hour recordings. Damage to the hippocampus and presentation of postinsult anxiety-related behavior did not significantly differ between treatment groups at 72h. However, return of normal behaviors such as grooming, levels of activity, and the evaluation of overall recovery of SE mice were all superior at 24h in animals given midazolam compared with lorazepam. Our results indicate that midazolam is as effective as lorazepam as an anticonvulsant in this model while also providing improved animal recovery after SE. These data suggest that midazolam might be considered by researchers as an anticonvulsant in animal models of SE, particularly as it appears to satisfy the requirements of refining procedures involving experimental animals at early time-points after SE.",

The present study investigated the effect of buffer components (phosphate or Tris-HCl) and their concentration (10-200 mM) on the CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 activities of HLM, using paclitaxel and triazolam, respectively, as marker substrates. 3. The Km (or S50) and Vmax values for both paclitaxel 6\u03b1-hydroxylation and triazolam \u03b1- and 4-hydroxylation, estimated by fitting analyses based on the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equation, greatly depended on the buffer components and their concentration. 4. The CLint values in phosphate buffer were 1.2-3.0-fold (paclitaxel) or 3.1-6.4-fold (triazolam) higher than in Tris-HCl buffer at 50-100 mM. These values also depended on the buffer concentration, with a maximum 2.3-fold difference observed between 50 and 100 mM which are both commonly used in drug metabolism studies. 5. These findings suggest the necessity for optimization of the buffer conditions in the quantitative evaluation of metabolic clearances, such as in vitro-in vivo extrapolation and also estimating the contribution of a particular enzyme in drug metabolism.",

    "113": "The dual hypocretin receptor (HcrtR) antagonist almorexant (ALM) may promote sleep through selective disfacilitation of wake-promoting systems, whereas benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) such as zolpidem (ZOL) induce sleep through general inhibition of neural activity. Previous studies have indicated that HcrtR antagonists cause less-functional impairment than BzRAs. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying these differential profiles, we compared the effects of ALM and ZOL on functional activation of wake-promoting systems at doses equipotent for sleep induction. Sprague-Dawley rats, implanted for EEG/EMG recording, were orally administered vehicle (VEH), 100\u2009mg/kg ALM, or 100\u2009mg/kg ZOL during their active phase and either left undisturbed or kept awake for 90\u2009min after which their brains were collected. ZOL-treated rats required more stimulation to maintain wakefulness than VEH- or ALM-treated rats. We measured Fos co-expression with markers for wake-promoting cell groups in the lateral hypothalamus (Hcrt), tuberomammillary nuclei (histamine; HA), basal forebrain (acetylcholine; ACh), dorsal raphe (serotonin; 5HT), and singly labeled Fos(+) cells in the locus coeruleus (LC). Following SD, Fos co-expression in Hcrt, HA, and ACh neurons (but not in 5HT neurons) was consistently elevated in VEH- and ALM-treated rats, whereas Fos expression in these neuronal groups was unaffected by SD in ZOL-treated rats. Surprisingly, Fos expression in the LC was elevated in ZOL- but not in VEH- or ALM-treated SD animals. These results indicate that Hcrt signaling is unnecessary for the activation of Hcrt, HA, or ACh wake-active neurons, which may underlie the milder cognitive impairment produced by HcrtR antagonists compared to ZOL.", 
    "114": "To date, antipsychotics remain the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and related disorders although other psychotropic medications and non-pharmaceutical interventions have been used adjunctively in some patients and settings. Regular surveys on access to and prescription patterns of psychotropic medications in clinical practice are an important and efficient way of examining the use and time trends of treatments in a given population and region. Unlike developed Western countries, Asian countries have not fully undergone deinstitutionalisation of the severely and chronically mentally ill, and community-based mental health services are still under-developed. As a result, a large number of psychiatric patients still receive treatments in psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, there have been very limited studies examining access to and prescription patterns of psychotropic medications for schizophrenia patients in Asian countries. In this paper, we focus on the only international project on the use of psychotropic medications in schizophrenia patients in selected East and Southeast Asian countries/territories summarising its major findings. Most of the first- and second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs and SGAs) are available in Asian countries, but the access to psychotropic medications is largely affected by socio-cultural and historical contexts, health insurance schemes, health care policy, medication cost and consumers' preference across different countries/territories. Overall, the proportional use of FGAs, high dose antipsychotic treatment and antipsychotic polypharmacy have decreased, while the use of SGAs and antidepressants have increased and the utilisation of benzodiazepines and mood stabilisers has remained relatively stable over time. However, within these general trends, there is great inter-country variation regarding the psychotropic prescribing patterns and trends in Asian schizophrenia patients that also seems to differ from data in many Western countries.",

With respect to schizophrenia, social withdrawal belongs to the category of negative symptoms and is associated with deficits in the cognitive domain. Here, we used the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) for induction of social withdrawal in rats and assessed the efficacy of several atypical antipsychotics with different pharmacological profiles as putative treatment. In addition, we reasoned that the marijuana constituent cannabidiol (CBD) may provide benefit or could be proposed as an adjunct treatment in combination with antipsychotics. Hooded Lister rats were tested in the three-chamber version for social interaction, with an initial novelty phase, followed after 3 min by a short-term recognition memory phase. No drug treatment affected sociability. However, distinct effects on social recognition were revealed. MK-801 reduced social recognition memory at all doses (>0.03 mg/kg). Predosing with aripiprazole dose-dependently (2 or 10 mg/kg) prevented the memory decline, but doses of 0.1 mg/kg risperidone or 1 mg/kg olanzapine did not. Intriguingly, CBD impaired social recognition memory (12 and 30 mg/kg) but did not rescue the MK-801-induced deficits. When CBD was combined with protective doses of aripiprazole (CBD-aripiprazole at 12 :\u2009 or 5 : 2 mg/kg) the benefit of the antipsychotic was lost. At the same time, activity-related changes in behaviour were excluded as underlying reasons for these pharmacological effects. Collectively, the combined activity of aripiprazole on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1A receptors appears to provide a significant advantage over risperidone and olanzapine with respect to the rescue of cognitive deficits reminiscent of schizophrenia. The differential pharmacological properties of CBD, which are seemingly beneficial in human patients, did not back-translate and rescue the MK-801-induced social memory deficit.",

The upregulation of cortical p-FADD/FADD was exclusively observed in the nucleus (up to 2.8-fold), where the transciption factor NF-\u03baB was also increased (up to 46%), and that of p-PEA/p-Akt1 only in the cytosol (up to 53%), suggesting that p-FADD/p-PEA/p-Akt1 are involved in sleep-induced neuroplasticity. Repeated treatment with midazolam (60 mg/kg, 4 days) induced behavioral (prolonged sleep latency and reduced sleeping time) and neurochemical (reduced p-FADD/p-PEA contents) tolerance. These findings indicated that p-FADD/p-PEA are novel molecules in GABAA receptor signaling and that cortical p-PEA and p-FADD, working in tandem, are involved in the complex molecular processes leading to the hypnotic effect of midazolam in mice.",

Mortality was more common among episodes that were not treated according to the published status epilepticus treatment guidelines compared to the episodes where guidelines were followed.", 
    "164": "Our findings showed that factors such as younger age, acute neurologic pathology and coma at presentation were associated with IVAD use in patients with NCSE.

However, the long-term outcome of disturbed nocturnal sleep/wake patterns in AD and on increased stress of spousal caregivers is unclear. This study assessed the 5-year effect of nocturnal SD on the long-term outcome in AD patients. A total of 156 donepezil-treated mild-moderate AD patients (93 AD + SD and 63 AD - SD as a control group) were recruited. The AD + SD patients were formed into 4 subgroups according to the preferences of spousal caregivers for treatment with atypical antipsychotics (0.5-1 mg risperidone, n = 22), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic (5-10 mg zolpidem tartrate, n = 33), melatonin (2.55 mg, n = 9), or no-drug treatment (n = 29). SD were evaluated by polysomnography, sleep scale, and cognitive scale examinations. Moreover, all spousal caregivers of AD patients were assessed using a series of scales, including sleep, anxiety, mood, and treatment attitude scales. Our data showed that nocturnal sleep/wake disturbances were significantly associated with lower 5-year outcomes for AD patients, earlier nursing home placement, and more negative emotions of spousal caregivers. Treatment with low-dose atypical antipsychotic risperidone improved the 5-year outcome in AD + SD patients. In conclusion, low-dose atypical antipsychotic risperidone improves the 5-year outcome in AD patients with SD. Moreover, improvement of nocturnal sleep problems in AD patients will also bring better emotional stability for AD caregivers.",

Its occurrence after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in pediatric population is a neglected scenario. In our series, all pediatric patients with moderate and severe head injuries were studied and those patients who developed PSH were monitored for the PSH episodes. Four children out of 36 cases of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury developed features of PSH. Admission GCS of 3 children were 4/15 and 1 child was 6/15 and each of them had an ICU stay of more than 2 weeks and a poor DRS score at discharge. The presence of PSH is known to produce poorer outcome in terms of overall mortality, time needed for recovery, chances of developing infections, etc. which was also seen in these cases presented here. Though some studies have provided guidelines for the management of PSH like symptomatic management and use of drugs like clonidine, bromocriptine, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin, strict management guidelines are not established and exact incidence in pediatric population is not determined.", 
    "179": "The second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are associated with weight gain and an increased incidence of metabolic diseases. The metabolic impairments are assumed a consequence of increased body adiposity secondary to central nervous system-associated increases in food intake. We have previously reported that, independent of weight gain, 9 days of olanzapine administration to control subjects is associated with insulin resistance and increases in postprandial levels of insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 to a mixed meal challenge. This current report describes previously unpublished data on the effects of the SGAs olanzapine and aripiprazole compared with placebo on detailed hunger and satiety responses over the 12-day inpatient evaluation as well as postprandial ghrelin and leptin responses prior to and following administration of the 2 SGAs. We found no changes in hunger, fullness, or in the orexigenic hormone ghrelin or satiety hormone leptin, consistent with our previous report indicating no change in weight during this study. The results indicate that the SGAs are associated with metabolic changes prior to changes in hunger, satiety, and food intake, and this temporal separation suggests that there are differential mechanisms mediating SGA-associated changes in metabolism and food intake.",

Many of these patients have epilepsy and are medicated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin (PHT) are known to promote the metabolism of midazolam, and the blood levels of midazolam in patients medicated with CBZ or PHT may be different from those in healthy individuals. In this study, we clarified the influences of CBZ and PHT on the blood level of intravenously administered midazolam in patients medicated with CBZ or PHT. The subjects were divided into the following groups: not medicated with AEDs (control group), medicated with only CBZ or PHT (mono CBZ/PHT group), and medicated with CBZ or PHT or both and other AEDs (poly CBZ/PHT group). General anesthesia was achieved using midazolam, propofol, and remifentanil, and then the blood midazolam level was measured at 10, 30, and 60\u00a0min after intravenous midazolam administration. According to the results, the blood midazolam level was significantly lower in the mono and poly CBZ/PHT groups than in the control group. This finding suggests that intravenously administered midazolam may have a weaker effect in patients medicated with CBZ or PHT.",

    "191": "Several events occurring during the secondary damage of traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause oxidative stress. F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs) and F(4)-neuroprostanes (F(4)-NPs) are specific lipid peroxidation markers generated from arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively. In this study, we evaluated oxidative stress in patients with moderate and severe TBI. Since sedatives are routinely used to treat TBI patients and propofol has been considered an antioxidant, TBI patients were randomly treated with propofol or midazolam for 72 h postoperation. We postoperatively collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 15 TBI patients for 6-10 d and a single specimen of CSF or plasma from 11 controls. Compared with the controls, the TBI patients exhibited elevated levels of F(2)-IsoPs and F(4)-NPs in CSF throughout the postsurgery period regardless of the sedative used. Compared with the group of patients who received midazolam, those who received propofol exhibited markedly augmented levels of plasma F(2)-IsoPs, which were associated with higher F(4)-NPs levels and lower total nitrate/nitrite levels in CSF early in the postsurgery period. Furthermore, the higher CSF F(2)-IsoPs levels correlated with 6-month and 12-month worse outcomes, which were graded according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale. The results demonstrate enhanced oxidative damage in the brain of TBI patients and the association of higher CSF levels of F(2)-IsoPs with a poor outcome. Moreover, propofol treatment might promote lipid peroxidation in the circulation, despite possibly suppressing nitric oxide or peroxynitrite levels in CSF, because of the increased loading of the lipid components from the propofol infusion.",

Amisulpride is one of the atypical antipsychotic that has been effective for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. We examined the effect of augmentation of oral low doses of amisulpride with lorazepam on resolution of catatonic symptoms. Fifteen patients with catatonia were treated with a combination of oral lorazepam (2-4 mg) with amisulpride (100 mg). Catatonic symptoms were rated using the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale at the baseline and daily thereafter. There was complete resolution of catatonic symptoms on the third day in all patients. There was significant reduction of the total Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale score over time (F = 181.38, P < 0.001) with a strong effect size (partial \u03b7 = 0.96).

    "193": "In adult mice, monocular enucleation (ME) results in an immediate deactivation of the contralateral medial monocular visual cortex. An early restricted reactivation by open eye potentiation is followed by a late overt cross-modal reactivation by whiskers (Van Brussel et al., 2011). In adolescence (P45), extensive recovery of cortical activity after ME fails as a result of suppression or functional immaturity of the cross-modal mechanisms (Nys et al., 2014). Here, we show that dark exposure before ME in adulthood also prevents the late cross-modal reactivation component, thereby converting the outcome of long-term ME into a more P45-like response. Because dark exposure affects GABAergic synaptic transmission in binocular V1 and the plastic immunity observed at P45 is reminiscent of the refractory period for inhibitory plasticity reported by Huang et al. (2010), we molecularly examined whether GABAergic inhibition also regulates ME-induced cross-modal plasticity. Comparison of the adaptation of the medial monocular and binocular cortices to long-term ME or dark exposure or a combinatorial deprivation revealed striking differences. In the medial monocular cortex, cortical inhibition via the GABAA receptor \u03b11 subunit restricts cross-modal plasticity in P45 mice but is relaxed in adults to allow the whisker-mediated reactivation. In line, in vivo pharmacological activation of \u03b11 subunit-containing GABAA receptors in adult ME mice specifically reduces the cross-modal aspect of reactivation. Together with region-specific changes in glutamate acid decarboxylase (GAD) and vesicular GABA transporter expression, these findings put intracortical inhibition forward as an important regulator of the age-, experience-, and cortical region-dependent cross-modal response to unilateral visual deprivation.", 
    "194": "In adult mice, vision loss through one eye instantly reduces neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Strengthening of remaining eye inputs in the binocular cortex is followed by cross-modal adaptations in the monocular cortex, in which whiskers become a dominant nonvisual input source to attain extensive cortical reactivation. We show that the cross-modal component does not occur in adolescence because of increased intracortical inhibition, a phenotype that was mimicked in adult enucleated mice when treated with indiplon, a GABAA receptor \u03b11 agonist. The cross-modal versus unimodal responses of the adult monocular and binocular cortices also mirror regional specificity in inhibitory alterations after visual deprivation. Understanding cross-modal plasticity in response to sensory loss is essential to maximize patient susceptibility to sensory prosthetics.",

We followed 297 older veterans diagnosed with depression and provided a new AD medication prospectively for 4 months. Data include validated self-report measures and VA pharmacy records. At initial assessment, 20.5% of participants were prescribed a BZD. Those with a BZD prescription at baseline were significantly more likely than those without to have a personality disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorder, or other anxiety disorder, and higher depressive symptom and anxiety symptom scale scores on average. In adjusted regressions, BZD use was not significantly associated with AD adherence, any improvement in depressive symptoms, or a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms. Our results suggest BZD use concurrent with AD treatment does not significantly improve depressive outcomes in older veterans.",

Current guidelines support the use of propofol sedation, which has the same rate of adverse effects as traditional sedation with benzodiazepines and/or opioids, but decreases the procedural and recovery time. Non-anesthesiologist administered propofol sedation has become an option in most of the countries, due to limited anesthesiology resources and the increasing evidence from prospective studies and meta-analyses that the procedure is safe with a similar rate of adverse events with traditional sedation. The advantages include a high quality of endoscopic examination, improved satisfaction for patients and doctors, as well as decreased recovery and discharge time.

In the remaining 4243 patients, one or more medications that were considered to be PIMs had been prescribed to 48.4% of patients. PIM-induced ADEs were found in 8% of these patients by pharmacists during home visits. The top ADE-inducing medications were strong anticholinergic antihistamines, benzodiazepines, sulpiride and digoxin. The most common ADEs associated with benzodiazepines were frequent lightheadedness, somnolence and sleepiness, which increase the risk of falls and subsequent fractures in elderly patients. The following factors associated with ADEs were identified: sex, pharmacist awareness of prescription issues, frequency of visits and time spent at patients' homes, and the frequency of detailed checks for patient adverse reactions by pharmacists.", 
    "212": "The PIM prevalence associated with home healthcare in Japan was relatively high, as reported in previous studies. The present study suggests that pharmacists could reduce the incidence of PIMs and consequent ADEs.", 
    "213": "This study tightly controlled seizure duration and severity during status epilepticus (SE) in postnatal day 10 (P10) rats, in order to isolate hyperthermia as the main variable and to study its consequences. Body temperature was maintained at 39 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C in hyperthermic SE rats (HT+SE) or at 35 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C in normothermic SE animals (NT+SE) during 30 min of SE, which was induced by lithium-pilocarpine (3 mEq/kg, 60 mg/kg) and terminated by diazepam and cooling to NT. All video/EEG measures of SE severity were similar between HT+SE and NT+SE pups. At 24h, neuronal injury was present in the amygdala in the HT+SE group only, and was far more severe in the hippocampus in HT+SE than NT+SE pups. Separate groups of animals were monitored four months later for spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Only HT+SE animals developed convulsive SRS. Both HT+SE and NT+SE animals developed electrographic SRS (83% vs. 55%), but SRS frequency and severity were higher in hyperthermic animals (12.5 \u00b1 3.5 vs. 4.2 \u00b1 2.0 SRS/day). The density of hilar neurons was lower, thickness of the amygdala and perirhinal cortex was reduced, and lateral ventricles were enlarged in HT+SE over NT+SE littermates and HT/NT controls. In this model, hyperthermia greatly increased the epileptogenicity of SE and its neuropathological sequelae.", 
    "214": "Here we present a case of successful treatment employing a mixed approach including pharmacological and psychosomatic treatments for a 72-year-old woman who experienced severe nausea and vomiting in reaction to postoperative stress from gastric cancer surgery. This case demonstrates that appropriate provision of psychosomatic treatments, including a psychotherapeutic session and autogenic training, enhances the efficacy of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "215": "Triazolam has similar pharmacological properties as other benzodiazepines and is generally used as a sedative to treat insomnia. Alprazolam represents a possible alternative to midazolam for the premedication of surgical patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anxiolytic, sedative, and amnestic properties of triazolam and alprazolam as pre-anesthetic medications.", 
    "216": "Sixty adult patients were randomly allocated to receive oral triazolam 0.25 mg or alprazolam 0.5 mg one hour prior to surgery. A structured assessment interview was performed in the operating room (OR), the recovery room, and the ward. The levels of anxiety and sedation were assessed on a 7-point scale (0 = relaxation to 6 = very severe anxiety) and a 5-point scale (0 = alert to 4 = lack of responsiveness), respectively. The psychomotor performance was estimated using a digit symbol substitution test. As a memory test, we asked the patients the day after the surgery if they remembered being moved from the ward to the OR, and what object we had shown them in the OR.", 
    "217": "There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to anxiety and sedation. The postoperative interviews showed that 22.2% of the triazolam-treated patients experienced a loss of memory in the OR, against a 0% memory loss in the alprazolam-treated patients. In comparison with alprazolam 0.5 mg, triazolam 0.25 mg produced a higher incidence of amnesia without causing respiratory depression.", 
    "218": "Oral triazolam 0.25 mg can be an effective preanesthetic medication for psychomotor performance.", 
    "219": "More than half a century after their discovery, benzodiazepines (BDZs) still represent one of the largest and most widely prescribed groups of psychotropic compounds, not only in clinical psychiatry but also in the entire medical field. Over the last two decades, however, there has been an increased focus on the development of antidepressants and antipsychotics on the part of the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, and researchers, with a reduced interest in BDZs, in spite of their widespread clinical use. As a consequence, many psychiatric residents, medical students, nurses, and other mental health professionals might receive poor academic teaching and training regarding these agents, and have the false impression that BDZs represent an outdated chapter in clinical psychopharmacology. However, recent advances in the field, including findings concerning epidemiology, addiction risk, and drug interactions, as well as the introduction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition with related diagnostic changes, strongly encourage an updated appraisal of the use of BDZs in clinical practice. During a recent thematic event convened with the aim of approaching this topic in a critical manner, a group of young Italian psychiatrists attempted to highlight possible flaws in current teaching pathways, identify the main clinical pros and cons regarding current use of BDZs in clinical practice, and provide an updated overview of their use across specific clinical areas and patient populations. The main results are presented and discussed in this review.", 
    "220": "To quantify pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships of various classes of GABAA agonists in healthy volunteers, in order to investigate the sensitivity of the biomarker responses due to differing GABAA-subtype selectivity and to explore the correlation between biomarker responses and side effects of these drugs.", 
    "221": "A comprehensive search was conducted for published placebo-controlled clinical studies of non- and \u03b11-selective GABAA drugs in healthy volunteers. PK/PD models were developed for concentrations and biomarker outcomes (saccadic eye movement (SEM), visual analogue scale (VAS), digit symbol substitution task (DSST), and critical flicker fusion test (CFFT)) extracted from included studies. Predicted responses and equivalent doses for biomarkers (based on predicted response) were used to compare drug effects. And the relationship between biomarkers and safety was explored by linear regression.", 
    "222": "A total of 2237 data from 163 articles were included. Based on PK and placebo effect modeling, linear biomarker-concentration relationships well fit the data. The \u03b11-selective compounds had similar equivalent doses for VAS, DSST, and CFFT (4.7-6.7\u00a0mg), which were about three to seven times lower than that for SEM (14.4-35.5\u00a0mg), while such difference was less evident for non-selective drugs. DSST had the highest correlations with incidences of somnolence and dizziness.", 
    "223": "The integral PK/PD models of GABAA agonists were established in healthy volunteers. SEM was identified as the most sensitive biomarker in differentiating GABAA receptor \u03b11 subtype selective compounds. The exploratory analysis implied that different relationships existed between the drug effects on biomarkers and the adverse event profiles in healthy volunteers.", 
    "224": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed for the treatment of anxiety or insomnia, but their impact on mortality is still debated. This study investigated the impact of benzodiazepine use on short term mortality. Exposed-unexposed cohorts were constructed with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the UK and with the General Sample of Beneficiaries (EGB) in France. Benzodiazepine incident users were matched to incident users of antidepressants/non-benzodiazepine sedatives and to controls (non-users of antidepressants or anxiolytics/hypnotics) according to age and gender in both sources (and practice for the CPRD only). Survival at one year was studied using Cox regression model. In the CPRD, the final population comprised 94 123 patients per group (57 287 in the EGB). In the CPRD, adjusted HR was 3.73 in benzodiazepine users (95% CI, 3.43-4.06), and 1.61 (1.47-1.76) in antidepressant/non-benzodiazepine users compared to controls. When considering benzodiazepine use as a time-dependent covariate, adjusted HR for current use at 12 months was 1.70 (1.36-2.12). In the EGB, adjusted HR was 1.26 in benzodiazepine users (95% CI, 1.08-1.48), and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.91-1.27) in antidepressant/non-benzodiazepine users. When considering benzodiazepine use as a time-dependent covariate, adjusted HR for current use at 12 months was 1.03 (0.74-1.44). Using two nationally representative databases, we found a significant while moderate increase in all-cause mortality in relation to benzodiazepines, in a population of incident and mostly occasional users. This issue need to be monitored given the extensive use of these drugs."
