    "0": "The NMDA antagonist MK-801 at 0.3 mg/kg, i.p. increased the punished response under a MULT VI 1.5/FR 5-punishment schedule of food reinforcement in mice. Furthermore, although neither MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) nor diazepam (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.) was without effect when separately administered, a significant increase in the punished response appeared after the combined administration of these two drugs. The present results suggest that MK-801 not only shows an anticonflict effect, but also enhances the anticonflict effect of benzodiazepine anxiolytics in mice.", 
    "1": "The effects of lesions in the centromedial and basolateral amygdala were examined using three different tests sensitive to the following stress-related responses: exploratory behavior, pain reactivity, and immune responses. The most clear-cut results were found with exploratory behavior. Rats with lesions of the centromedial amygdala tended to explore a radial-arm maze more quickly and entered more novel arms of the maze than controls. Those with lesions of the basolateral amygdala were generally too hesitant to explore at all. No significant differences were found between groups on measurements of natural killer cell activity. In tests of pain perception, rats in the control group displayed an analgesic response on the hot plate following an injection of the anxiogenic drug, RO 15-1788, whereas rats with centromedial lesions tended to exhibit a blunted response. These findings provide modest support for the view that the central and lateral regions of the amygdala play complementary roles in aversively motivated behaviors and in stress-related response patterns.", 
    "2": "The ratio of cis/trans isomers (referring to 11b-substituent and 2- or 3-substituent) of benzodiazepinooxazoles was estimated by using the lanthanide shift reagent (Eu(fod)3-d27) for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The amide carbonyl oxygen at 6-position is considered to coordinate with the reagent, because the largest downfield shifts were observed at the amide carbonyl carbon (C-6) in 13C-NMR and the amide hydrogen (H-7) in 1H-NMR. The ratios depend largely on the substituents at 11b-, 2-, and 3-positions. The cis isomer for compounds having 11b-hydrogen increases with an increase in the bulkiness of the substituents at 2-position. The cis isomer for compounds having 3-methyl group decreases with change from 11b-2'-chlorophenyl group (mexazolam) to 11b-hydrogen.", 
    "3": "Benzodiazepines differ from many of the other abused substances in that there are legitimate medical indications for their use. Any prescription for benzodiazepines must be preceded by a careful risk-benefit analysis that considers the specifics of an individual's particular life situation, personality style, and psychiatric diagnosis. The risk of benzodiazepine abuse by chemically dependent individuals and the problems of cognitive and/or psychomotor impairment and dependence for all individuals have to be balanced against the therapeutic benefits of these drugs for patients who experience disabling anxiety disorders or anxiety that accompanies chronic medical illness. Problems of dependence can be minimized by utilizing a variety of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic strategies to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms that might accompany the discontinuation of long-term benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "4": "The synthesis and biological activity of a series of 4,5-dihydro-1H-2,4-benzodiazepine is reported. The structure-activity relationship of these new compounds was studied based on X-ray investigations. Pharmacological investigations have shown that the compounds exert depressive action on the central nervous system and exhibit weak neuroleptic activity.", 
    "5": "Buspirone and other drugs that act as 5-HT1A agonists appear to be clinically effective anxiolytics in humans, yet their anticonflict effects, though robust in pigeons, are equivocal in rodents. In the present study we examined the effects of the benzodiazepine midazolam and a series of 5-HT1A agonists on punished responding of squirrel monkeys. Lever presses were reinforced according to a fixed-interval 3-min schedule; in addition, each thirtieth lever press was punished. Midazolam produced large increases in response rates, whereas none of the 5-HT1A compounds produced any increases in responding. Most of these drugs decreased response rates at the higher doses examined. Although the reasons for the discrepancy between species in the anticonflict effects of serotonergic anxiolytics cannot be specified, the different anatomical distribution of 5-HT1A binding sites across species may suggest a different functional role for this receptor.", 
    "6": "Concurrent performances were studied in rats under conditions where responses on one lever postponed shock on a Sidman avoidance schedule and responses on another lever produced periods of signaled timeout from avoidance on a variable-interval schedule. Chlorpromazine decreased rates of responding on both the timeout and avoidance levels to about the same extent. The effects of chlordiazepoxide and CGS 9896 depended upon the event maintaining responding. Both drugs increased responding on the timeout lever at doses that concurrently decreased responding on the avoidance lever. Thus, the novel anxiolytic CGS 9896 produced effects that closely resembled those of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide. Like chlorpromazine, buspirone decreased both avoidance and timeout responding. Despite the documented anxiolytic properties of buspirone, its actions here were unlike those of the other anxiolytic drugs tested. Nonetheless, the differentiation between drugs obtained with the timeout from avoidance procedure indicates its utility for behavioral pharmacology.", 
    "7": "The use of psychoactive medication was examined among 64 people with mental retardation who moved from two hospitals to the community as part of a plan of resettlement. There was no significant difference between the overall use of antipsychotic drugs 2 years before discharge, on the date of discharge and after at least 6 months (mean 25 months) of community living, although changes in drugs and doses prescribed had taken place. About 39% of people were receiving antipsychotics, 32% receiving antiepileptics, 7% receiving antidepressants and 8% receiving benzodiazepines.", 
    "8": "We studied the incidence of fasciculations and postoperative myalgias in 100 female outpatients who had laparoscopy under thiopentone, N2O, isoflurane anaesthesia. Four groups of 20 patients each were pretreated with saline (group 1), tubocurarine 0.05 mg/kg (group 2), vecuronium 0.006 mg/kg (group 3), or midazolam 0.025 mg/kg (group 4), followed by suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Group 5 received only vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg as relaxant (no suxamethonium). Fasciculations were graded, and postoperative myalgias rated on the first and third postoperative days. In groups 1-5 the incidence of fasciculations was 95, 15, 25, 95 and 0%; the incidence of myalgias on the first day after operation was 70, 45, 65, 75 and 60%, and on the third day after operation 20, 5, 20, 20, and 5%, respectively. We conclude that pretreatment with vecuronium, but not midazolam, decreases the incidence of fasciculations after suxamethonium (p less than 0.05) and that in this patient population, postoperative myalgias appear to be unrelated to the use of suxamethonium.", 
    "9": "Benzodiazepines can be prescribed for a number of medical conditions. Many physicians are reluctant to prescribe benzodiazepines out of fear of producing dependence in patients and incurring the disapproval of their peers. Studies of psychotropic drug use and abuse demonstrate that individuals using benzodiazepines for treatment of a medical illness rarely demonstrate tolerance to the therapeutic action of the medication or escalate the dose. Eighty percent of benzodiazepines are prescribed for 6 months or less, and elderly women are the most common long-term users of low-dose benzodiazepines. In contrast, recreational use of benzodiazepines is associated with polysubstance abuse, lack of medical supervision, rapid tolerance to the euphoric or sedating side effect, and escalation of dose. Most recreational users of benzodiazepines are young men. Documentation of indication for use, collection of drug-abuse history, close monitoring, and drug holidays can improve the management of this class of medication.", 
    "10": "Depression is a common complication of anxiety disorders. Major depressive disorder may be the primary diagnosis, the patient having been unaware of depressed affect until anxiety became less prominent. Depression may also be a comorbid condition, appearing because anxiety lowers the threshold for its development or as a result of use of central nervous system depressants or intercurrent medical illnesses. Depression may also be a response to psychosocial consequences of anxiety or its resolution. In some anxious patients, depression is a later stage in the development of a dysregulated stress response. Initial treatment of depression involves therapy for organic causative factors and psychosocial problems. Medications that may be useful for both depression and anxiety include cyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and possibly azapirones and benzodiazepines. Combined anxiolytic-antidepressant treatment may be necessary for some patients.", 
    "11": "Issues related to the epidemiology, nosology, and differential diagnosis of organic aggressive disorders in the elderly are discussed. Rating and monitoring of aggressive events using the Overt Aggression Scale are reviewed. The management of acute aggression with antipsychotic agents and benzodiazepines is presented, as well as an approach for using beta-blockers, anticonvulsant agents, and serotonin-specific antidepressants and an antianxiety agent for the treatment of chronic aggression.", 
    "12": "Anxiety in the elderly is often mixed with depression, and successful antidepressant treatment will often also eliminate the anxiety. For specific symptoms of generalized anxiety, benzodiazepines are important therapeutic agents. Selection of an appropriate benzodiazepine is guided by pharmacokinetic properties of individual drugs. Long half-life benzodiazepines usually are not preferred for older patients because of cumulative toxicity. Among the short half-life drugs, high-potency compounds (e.g., lorazepam, alprazolam) may be more toxic than low-potency compounds (e.g., oxazepam). Although confirming controlled data are lacking, clinical experience suggests that dependence, rebound symptoms, and memory impairment may be more intense with lorazepam and alprazolam. Clinicians should endeavor to use benzodiazepines for short periods when treating the elderly. Long-term use has been reported effective and nonhazardous, but subtle and gradual cognitive impairment may occur in other patients over time. Buspirone has also been reported as an effective, nontoxic antianxiety compound for older patients, but more experience and comparative research data are needed.", 
    "13": "We investigated the potential ability of p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (p-F-HHSiD) to discriminate between M1 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the genes encoding the two receptors. Both radioligand binding and functional assays were utilized for this purpose. In contrast to initial reports of a 14-fold selectivity of this antagonist for M3 versus M1 receptors, we have detected a qualitatively similar selectivity that was markedly smaller in magnitude.", 
    "14": "Stimulation of mucosal alkaline secretion represents an opportunity for discovering novel drugs of potential benefit in maintenance therapy of duodenal ulcer disease. We screened over 200 agents representing the full spectrum of pharmacological categories in order to characterize stimulatory pathways and identify mechanistic leads. A variety of eicosanoids, phospho-diesterase inhibitors and adrenoreceptor agonists together with forskolin, 6-hydroxy-dopamine, 2-chloroadenosine, diazepam, testosterone, dipyridamole and dihydropyridazinone caused a reproducible increase in the metabolism-dependent component of alkaline secretion in bullfrog proximal duodenum. PGE2 (ED50 0.02 microgram/ml) was the most potent agent in vitro and was also the most effective stimulant of duodenal alkalinization in vivo in an anaesthetized cat preparation. Agents without effect on spontaneous alkaline secretion by amphibian duodenum included agonists and antagonists of histamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, inhibitors of amine uptake, monoamine oxidase and cholinesterase, plus various corticoids, diuretics, oestrogens, chemotherapeutic (anticancer) and antimicrobial agents. The major mechanism of stimulating alkaline secretion in the isolated duodenum is by increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels. This may occur by either inhibiting metabolism of the nucleotide or by stimulating its formation. Additionally, many stimulants appear to act indirectly via liberation of endogenous prostaglandins as judged from the marked attenuation of responses in the presence of indomethacin to all agonists apart from exogenous PGE2, forskolin, ICI 63197 (PDE inhibitor), 2-chloroadenosine and diazepam. Whether purinergic agonists and benzodiazepines act directly on the enterocyte or by releasing other paracrine mediators is unknown.", 
    "15": "Several Methyl N-(diphenylmethyl)-D,L-tryptophanates were synthetized and the affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor was measured. Disappointingly, none of the tested compounds showed to be active, even at the high concentration examined.", 
    "16": "The binding of the triazolobenzodiazepine [3H]alprazolam was studied to characterize the in vitro interactions with benzodiazepine receptors in membrane preparations of rat brain. Studies using nonequilibrium and equilibrium binding conditions for [3H]alprazolam resulted in high specific to nonspecific (signal to noise) binding ratios. The binding of [3H]alprazolam was saturable and specific with a low nanomolar affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in the rat brain. The Kd was 4.6 nM and the Bmax was 2.6 pmol/mg protein. GABA enhanced [3H]alprazolam binding while several benzodiazepine receptor ligands were competitive inhibitors of this drug. Compounds that bind to other receptor sites had a very weak or negligible effect on [3H]alprazolam binding. Alprazolam, an agent used as an anxiolytic and in the treatment of depression, acts in vitro as a selective and specific ligand for benzodiazepine receptors in the rat brain. The biochemical binding profile does not appear to account for the unique therapeutic properties which distinguish this compound from the other benzodiazepines in its class.", 
    "17": "A model for the development of pentobarbital tolerance and dependence was characterized and correlated with changes in radioligand binding to the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex. While one day of pentobarbital exposure decreased the duration of loss of righting reflex, tolerance to the hypothermic effects of thiopental and barbital took 7 days to develop, indicating that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic tolerance are separable. Increased sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures was first observed after 3 days of pentobarbital exposure, suggesting brain areas involved in seizure control develop tolerance to, and dependence on pentobarbital faster than those involved in temperature regulation. Acute exposure to pentobarbital in vivo did not affect cortical binding of [3H]muscimol in vitro, while tolerance caused a decrease in binding due to an increase in the low-affinity site KD. Pentobarbital tolerance also caused a decrease in the cortical binding of the benzodiazepine, [3H]flunitrazepam. These observations suggest that the acute effects of barbiturates on the GABAA receptor complex are reversible, while tolerance causes receptor modifications which may be related to the development of physical dependence.", 
    "18": "Rats were trained to switch-off aversive electrical brain stimulations applied to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) or mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) by pressing a bar (switch-off behavior). We investigated the effects of IP injections of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor inverse agonist FG 7142 (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) or BZ receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP: 5 mg/kg) on the switch-off latency, i.e., the time elapsed between the onset of the stimulation and its offset by a press of the bar. It was found that FG 7142 decreased, whereas CDP increased the mean switch-off latency for electrical stimulation of the PAG, which is interpreted as a potentiating effect of FG 7142 and a reducing effect of CDP on the electrically induced aversive state. By contrast, neither FG 7142 nor CDP were found to affect the mean switch-off latency for MLR stimulations. These results suggest a difference in the pharmacological sensitivity to BZ receptor ligands between aversive states elicited by electrical stimulation of the PAG or MLR.", 
    "19": "Effects of induction with midazolam on serum histamine levels (Study 1) and the volume as well as pH of gastric juice (Study 2) were studied. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 in midazolam group, thiamylal 4 mg.kg-1 in control group. In Study 1, serum histamine levels were measured with high performance liquid chromatography till 180 minutes after intubation. There were no statistical significance between the two groups in serum histamine levels at all points. But in midazolam group, at 30 minutes after intubation, the histamine level was significantly lower than the preinduction level. In control group, serum concentration of histamine increased but not significantly. In Study 2, gastric juice was sampled through naso-gastric tube inserted on the morning of operation. Gastric juice pH was measured with the use of pH Strip (E. Merck, F.R. Germany). There were no significant differences between the two groups in volume as well as pH of gastric juice at all points. It is concluded that midazolam used for induction of anesthesia might decrease histamine release, but it has no clinical effects on gastric juice secretion.", 
    "20": "Cholinergic receptors on canine bronchial smooth muscle (mediating excitation) or on the cholinergic nerve endings (modulating acetylcholine release) have not yet been characterized. In this study, the effects of agents selective for the various muscarinic receptors on mechanical and electrical responses in isolated segments of canine bronchial smooth muscle (3rd-6th order) were investigated. Carbachol (Cch), bethanechol (Bch), oxotremorine (Oxo), and McNeil A343 (McN) produced membrane depolarization and contractions with a ranked potency order of Oxo approximately Cch greater than Bch greater than McN. Oxo-induced contractions were antagonized by pirenzepine (Pir), AF-DX 116 (AF-DX), or hexahydrosiladifenidol (Hexa); Schild analysis yielded pA2 values of 6.61, 6.81, and 7.40, respectively. Contractions induced by field stimulation (FS) were antagonized by Pir, AF-DX, or Hexa with a potency order of Hexa greater than AF-DX approximately Pir. FS responses were potentiated by lower (i.e., M1-selective) concentrations of Pir, and antagonized by McN. The non-M1 agonists and antagonists had no such effects. These findings indicate that the postjunctional receptors are of the M3 subtype, and that the inhibitory receptors on the cholinergic nerve endings are of the M1 subtype.", 
    "21": "The records of 188 consecutive patients admitted for acute opiate intoxication were analyzed retrospectively to evaluate the morbidity and mortality of opiates. The most frequently used of these drugs were heroin (127 cases) and methadone (41 cases). In 79 cases the opiate was associated with another psychodepressant, usually benzodiazepines, alcohol or barbiturates. Forty-seven percent of the patients were admitted in deep coma, with respiratory arrest in almost every case. The complications observed in 49 patients were: aspiration of gastric contents (n = 24), rhabdomyolysis (n = 22), often associated with myocarditis (n = 13), pulmonary edema (n = 16), convulsions (n = 10), left ventricular dysfunction (n = 5) and lesions of the peripheral nervous system (n = 4). All patients survived, except one who died of cardiac arrest before admission. It is concluded that acute opiate intoxication treated in hospital has an excellent prognosis for life provided no cardiac arrest occurs prior to admission. One quarter of the patients require prolonged stay in an intensive care unit because of complications. The other patients, even when deeply comatose on admission, spend less than 1 day in hospital owing to the specific antagonist available.", 
    "22": "The substantia nigra (SN) is thought to be involved in the regulation of seizure activity and there is evidence that the nigra might be a site of anticonvulsant drug action, especially in the case of drugs that act by potentiating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission. The current studies monitored the anticonvulsant effect of four major antiepileptic drugs, i.e. valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and diazepam, in fully kindled rats before and after bilateral destruction of the SN. Rats were kindled by stimulation of either the basolateral amygdala or the piriform cortex. The SN was lesioned bilaterally by microinjection of ibotenic acid, and only animals with near-complete, selective destruction of the SN were used for final evaluation of the anticonvulsant drug experiments. The behavioural characteristics and the duration of fully kindled seizures were not altered by bilateral destruction of the SN. Phenobarbital, diazepam and valproate significantly reduced kindled seizures severity and duration before and after the SN lesions. Carbamazepine was the only drug to show a marked decrease in its anticonvulsant effects after SN lesion. Since benzodiazepines, valproate and phenobarbital are though to enhance GABAergic transmission, the lack of effect of SN lesions on the anticonvulsant effects of these drugs argues against the suggestion that the SN is the anatomical site responsible for exerting anticonvulsant effects in response to drug-induced augmentation of GABA transmission.", 
    "23": "Radiation inactivation was used to determine the molecular target size of the binding site for [3H]GR65630, a specific 5-HT3 receptor ligand, in two different neuronal tissues. Using a calibration curve of known molecular weight enzymes, the target sizes of [3H]GR65630 binding sites in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and rat brain were 98,600 +/- 11,300 and 49,100 +/- 8,500 Da, respectively. The results suggest 5-HT3 receptors may be present as dimers in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells.", 
    "24": "Recombinant rat lipocortin I increased [3H]PK 11195 binding to porcine aortic smooth muscle membranes, whereas a polyclonal anti-rat lipocortin I antiserum decreased both basal and lipocortin I-enhanced [3H]PK 11195 binding. The results suggest the possibility of lipocortin I being involved in the function of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "25": "Quantitative autoradiography of rat brain coronal sections show that maximum enhancement (more than 80%) of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA occurs in brain regions particularly rich in type I benzodiazepine receptors (inferior colliculus, medium raphe, central gray and substantia nigra); conversely, brain areas where type II predominates show the lowest enhancement by GABA (about 50%). These results, suggesting that the coupling of GABA receptors with type I sites is more efficient than that with type II sites, are at variance with those reported on GABA-benzodiazepine receptors expressed in transfected cells, where the greater GABA potentiation of benzodiazepine binding is due to a subtype of the type II site containing the alpha 3 subunit of the GABAA receptor. One possible explanation of these discrepancies is that the type II receptors found in type I-enriched tissues (inferior colliculus, median raphe, central gray and substantia nigra) are associated with the alpha 3-subunit, while the type II sites present in limbic and cortical regions represent a subpopulation carrying the alpha 2-subunit of the GABAA receptor, with lower GABA potentiation.", 
    "26": "Two cases of convulsions following intake of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazepil, are presented. The etiology is discussed and special precautions are recommended for the diagnostic employment of the preparation.", 
    "27": "The development of selective irreversible ligands has proven to be an invaluable technique for the isolation, purification and characterization of many receptor proteins. An isothiocyanato-derivative of the muscarinic antagonist aprophen was synthesized and evaluated as a potential irreversible ligand for muscarinic receptors. This compound (aprophit) displaced [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding from rat cerebral cortex with a Ki of 3.1 x 10(-7) M. The inhibition was concentration-dependent and could not be reversed by extensive washing. Aprophit inhibited the acetylcholine-stimulated release of catecholamines from isolated, perfused guinea pig adrenal glands in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition was not reversed by perfusing the tissue with Locke's solution and was not due to a non-selective acylation by the isothiocyanate function. The data suggest that aprophit is selectively acylating muscarinic receptor proteins and thus may be useful in their further characterization.", 
    "28": "In vitro protein binding studies were conducted to examine the interaction between ceftriaxone (CEF), probenecid (PROB) and diazepam (DIAZ). The presence of PROB and DIAZ at concentrations equal to molar albumin concentration caused a decrease in CEF affinity from 3.7 x 10(4) M-1 (control) to 1.1 x 10(4) (PROB) and 2.6 x 10(4) (DIAZ) M-1, but not in binding capacity in pooled human plasma. PROB and DIAZ at five times the molar albumin concentration also caused a decrease in CEF affinity from 4.5 x 10(4) M-1 (control) to 0.45 x 10(4) (PROB) and 3.0 x 10(4) (DIAZ) M-1 in isolated human serum albumin. DIAZ and PROB displaced one another, confirming their common binding site (Site II, the benzodiazepine site) on serum albumin. By contrast, CEF was unable to displace either PROB or DIAZ from defatted albumin. In the presence of elevated free fatty acid concentrations (four times the albumin concentration), CEF decreased the binding of both drugs. CEF free fraction (fp) in isolated human serum albumin (CEF fp = 7.7%) was increased by drugs which bind to Site I: sulfisoxazole (CEF fp = 68.1%), warfarin (CEF fp = 56.0%) and furosemide (CEF fp = 55.0%). At ten times the molar concentration of albumin, CEF displaced both warfarin (warfarin fp from 0.99 to 2.20%) and phenytoin (phenytoin fp from 17.7 to 23.4%) from defatted albumin. CEF appeared to bind to Site I (the warfarin site) on human serum albumin, and was displaced by PROB and DIAZ via a mechanism which did not involve direct competition at a common binding site.", 
    "29": "Chronic benzodiazepine agonist administration may lead to decreases in gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor binding and function, but little information is available concerning chronic GABA-neutral or GABA-negative benzodiazepine exposure. We evaluated effects of chronic exposure to flumazenil (Ro15-1788) and FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) on GABA-dependent chloride uptake in chick cerebral cortical neurons in primary culture. Acute flumazenil treatment (1 microM) had no effect on chloride uptake, but uptake was increased after 2 days of exposure. Similar increases were observed after 4 and 10 days. Flumazenil, 0.1 microM, had no effect after 10 days, and a 10 microM concentration had a similar effect as the 1 microM concentration. Acute FG 7142 (1 microM) decreased chloride uptake, but uptake was increased markedly after 2, 4, and 10 days of treatment. No effect was observed after treatment for 10 days with 0.1 microM, but a 10 microM concentration showed similar enhancement to the 1 microM concentration. Concurrent treatment with 0.3 microM flumazenil which did not affect chloride uptake and 1 microM FG 7142 for 10 days substantially attenuated the effects of FG 7142, suggesting that FG 7142 effects are mediated at the benzodiazepine site. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was increased in cultures treated for 10 days with 1 microM flumazenil or FG 7142, with an increase in receptor number in both cases but no change in apparent affinity. Neither flumazenil nor FG 7142 (1 microM for 10 days) altered GABA-independent chloride uptake, total cellular protein, protein synthesis or degradation, or neuronal survival. These results indicate that both chronic GABA-neutral and GABA-negative benzodiazepine exposures in cultured cortical neurons lead to increases in GABA-dependent chloride uptake and benzodiazepine binding. Effects of GABA-negative benzodiazepine exposure appear to be greater than those observed with GABA-neutral benzodiazepine exposure.", 
    "30": "In certain clinical situations, a close correlation between CNS alterations and changes in the normal functioning of the cardiovascular apparatus has been well documented. Thus, it has been shown that a certain type of behavior, termed type A, is significantly associated with coronary disease and other cardiovascular disorders. Stress, too, by activating complex neurohormonal mechanisms can become an important factor in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Systematic management of these disorders has not yet been worked out but centrally acting drugs, and especially benzodiazepines, have been found useful in reducing the stress reaction and the consequent psychosomatic cardiovascular involvement. Some molecules of this class of drugs have been shown to possess marked affinity for the cardiac muscle and to act effectively in control and suppression of the cardiovascular disorders following upon the neuro-hormonal activation caused by stressful events.", 
    "31": "The effects of systemic administration of kainic acid and pentylenetetrazol on interleukin-1 beta gene expression in the rat brain was studied. After the administration of kainic acid in a convulsive dose (10 mg/kg i.p.), Interleukin-1 beta mRNA was induced intensely in the cerebral cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus, moderately in the hippocampus and weakly in the striatum, but not in the midbrain, pons-medulla and cerebellum. Pentylenetetrazol induced Interleukin-1 beta mRNA in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus with a faster time-course than kainic acid. Diazepam suppressed both the convulsion and the induction of Interleukin-1 beta mRNA produced by kainic acid. Dexamethasone suppressed the induction of Interleukin-1 beta mRNA, but did neither the convulsion nor the induction of c-fos mRNA following the injection of kainic acid. These results provide the first evidence that intensive neuronal excitation induces Interleukin-1 beta mRNA in particular regions of the brain.", 
    "32": "In previous studies we demonstrated that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) were coupled to steroidogenesis in several adrenocortical and Leydig cell systems (Mukhin, A.G., Papadopoulos, V., Costa, E., and Krueger, K.E. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 9813-9816; Papadopoulos, V., Mukhin, A.G., Costa, E., and Krueger, K.E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3772-3779). The current study elucidates the specific step in the steroid biosynthetic pathway by which PBR mediate the stimulation in steroid hormone production. The adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-responsive Y-1 mouse adrenocortical cell line was used to compare the mechanisms by which ACTH and PK 11195 (a PBR ligand) stimulate steroidogenesis. The effects of these agents were studied at three stages along the steroid biosynthetic pathway: 1) secretion of 20 alpha OH-progesterone by Y-1 cell cultures; 2) pregnenolone production by isolated mitochondrial fractions; 3) quantities of cholesterol resident in outer and inner mitochondrial membrane fractions. Steroid synthesis stimulated by ACTH was blocked by cycloheximide, an effect documented by other laboratories characterized by an accumulation of mitochondrial cholesterol specifically in the outer membrane. In contrast, PK 11195-stimulated steroidogenesis was not inhibited by cycloheximide, and the magnitude of the stimulation was markedly enhanced when the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide and ACTH. When isolated mitochondria were used, stimulation of pregnenolone production by PK 11195 was largely independent of exogenously supplied cholesterol, indicating that PBR act on cholesterol already situated within the mitochondrial membranes. This phenomenon was found to be the result of a translocation of cholesterol from outer to inner mitochondrial membranes induced by the PBR ligand. These studies therefore suggest that mitochondrial intermembrane cholesterol transport in steroidogenic cells is mediated by a mechanism coupled to PBR.", 
    "33": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different dopamine receptor antagonists on the function of proprioceptive reflex mechanisms involved in the regulation of stance and gait. Haloperidol as preferential D2 and the 'pure' dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride significantly reduced the level of the reflex response in the gastrocnemius muscle following backward perturbation. Flupentixol, however, which in addition blocks D1 receptors, had no effect on compensatory gastrocnemius EMG responses. Furthermore, neither the peripherally acting dopamine D2 receptor antagonist domperidon nor the sedative diazepam had any significant influence on this functionally essential reflex mechanism. None of the drugs tested had a significant effect on the tibialis anterior responses elicited following forward perturbation. It is concluded that the reduced stretch sensitivity of the gastrocnemius (but not that of the tibialis anterior) during perturbations of stance described for parkinsonian patients corresponds to these results and arises from an impaired function of central dopamine D2 receptors.", 
    "34": "The chlordiazepoxide (CDP)-induced impairment of the passive avoidance response was attenuated by Ro 15-4513, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, physostigmine and scopolamine at low doses. In a biochemical approach, CDP increased, but Ro 15-4513 decreased the acetylcholine (ACh) levels of cerebral cortex. After the training of passive avoidance, the ACh levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex decreased. This change disappeared by pretraining administration of CDP. These results suggest that the effect of CDP on the passive avoidance response was related to AChergic neuronal systems.", 
    "35": "In a model of physical dependence in mice, treatment with cyclopyrrolones such as zopiclone and suriclone (from 4 to 400 mg/kg/day), did not modify the sensitivity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex to the partial inverse agonist FG 7142 following their withdrawal, whereas sensitivity changes were observed after treatment and withdrawal from some benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam and triazolam). These data suggest that, in contrast to some benzodiazepines, zopiclone and suriclone may not produce physical dependence.", 
    "36": "The Institute of Forensic Chemistry, Copenhagen, receives approximately 29,000 blood samples annually for alcohol determination from drivers suspected of drinking and driving. The incidence of benzodiazepines were estimated in the 877 alcohol-negative samples from six months (01.01-07.31 1983). Eight samples had to be excluded because of insufficient material. Screening for benzodiazepines was made by means of a radioreceptor-method. Quantification and identification of the benzodiazepines was performed by gas- and liquid-chromatography. 15% of the samples were found to be positive for benzodiazepines (13% positive for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam), while an earlier investigation of the same type of material, but including all blood samples, both alcohol-positive and negative showed only 5.8% of the samples positive for benzodiazepines (5.5% positive for diazepam). These findings are in agreement with the results of other investigations. 59% of the diazepam cases had a total concentration of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam higher than 1 mumol/kg. 69% were men and 31% were women. Most cases were found in the age group 20-30 years old. In only 22% of the cases, had the police required analyses for benzodiazepines. Due to the known difficulties in instituting proceedings against drivers influenced by drugs, it is feared, that the drug problem in connection with driving will be forgotten, all the while it is increasing steadily.",

In homogenate binding studies, L-365,260 displayed nanomolar affinity for CCK-B receptors in the cerebral cortex of several species including man (pIC50 congruent to 8.2) but showed low affinity for CCK-A receptors in the rat pancreas (pIC50 congruent to 6.3). By contrast, the CCK-A antagonist MK-329 showed the reverse selectivity (cortex: pIC50 congruent to 6.9, pancreas: pIC50 = 9.6). In autoradiographs of rat and monkey brain. 125I-BH-CCK binding was localized regionally with high levels being detected in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and some mid- and hindbrain nuclei. Specific 125I-BH-CCK binding was also localized to the substantia gelatinosa of the rat, monkey and human spinal cord. L-365,260 inhibited binding to most areas of the brain, but in the rat medial nucleus tractus solitarii and the monkey nucleus tractus solitarii. dorsomedial nucleus and infundibular hypothalamic nuclei together with the dorsomedial aspects of the caudate nucleus, where CCK-A sites are present, L-365,260 failed to displace all 125I-BH-CCK binding. In the primate spinal cord, L-365,260 was a relatively weak inhibitor of 125I-BH-CCK binding (pIC50 congruent to 6.0) whereas MK-329 showed high affinity for the CCK-A sites present there (pIC50 congruent to 9.6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The main objective of the present work was to determine whether the regulation of ACh release by nicotinic and muscarinic autoreceptors is compromised in the aged rat brain. For this, the effects of the nicotinic agonist N-methylcarbamylcholine (MCC) and the muscarinic-M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 on ACh release from brain slices of young (3-month-old), adult (9-month-old), and aged (27-month-old) rats were tested. The ability of MCC to enhance spontaneous ACh release in hippocampal, cerebral cortical, and cerebellar slices was only modestly altered with age. In contrast, the sensitivity of muscarinic autoreceptors in the aged hippocampus and cerebral cortex, but not the striatum, to blockade by the muscarinic-M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 was severely attenuated. To assess whether the age-related changes in cholinergic autoreceptor function may be due to deficits in presynaptic cholinergic markers, we tested whether choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, basal and evoked ACh release, and nicotinic and muscarinic binding sites are altered in the aged rats. ChAT activity in forebrain regions was decreased in the aged compared to the young and mature adult rats. Furthermore, the potassium-evoked, but not the spontaneous, release of ACh was markedly depressed in striatal, hippocampal, and cortical slices of aged rats. The densities of nicotinic and muscarinic-M2 binding sites, assessed using 3H-MCC and 3H-AF-DX 116 as selective ligands, respectively, were markedly reduced in homogenates of the striatum, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus of aged rats. In contrast, muscarinic-M1 sites, selectively labeled with 3H-pirenzepine, were not affected. Therefore, it appears that age-related decrements in ChAT activity and in muscarinic-M2, but not nicotinic, binding sites in the rat brain are reflected in a decreased function of muscarinic-M2 autoreceptors. However, the positive correlation between loss of ChAT activity, decreased muscarinic-M2 binding sites, and impaired muscarinic autoreceptor function is clearly tissue dependent.", 
    "39": "Using in vitro receptor autoradiography, the distributions of cholinergic muscarinic [3H-N-methyl scopolamine (NMS), 3H-pirenzepine (PZ), and 3H-oxotremorine-M (OXO-M)] and nicotinic [3H-acetylcholine (ACh)] receptors were mapped in the temporal cortices of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) ranging from 2-22 years of age. Although high-affinity 3H-PZ, low-affinity 3H-NMS binding (M1 sites) and high-affinity 3H-OXO-M, high-affinity 3H-NMS binding (M2 sites) occurred across all layers of the temporal neocortex, the laminar distribution of M1 and M2 receptor binding sites was different. M1 muscarinic receptor binding was concentrated in layers II and III, whereas M2 muscarinic receptor binding was greatest in layers IV and V. The concentration of both muscarinic (M1 and M2) and nicotinic receptor binding sites declined with increasing age, and decrements were uniform across all cortical layers. This investigation provides evidence for a decrease in cholinergic receptor binding with age in temporal cortices of rhesus monkeys. Moreover, these changes appear to precede previously reported age-associated memory deficits and neuropathological changes that occur in this species.", 
    "40": "Previous experiments in hamsters indicate that daily injections of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, can entrain the free-running circadian activity rhythm to the period of the injections and that, after discontinuation of triazolam injections, the period of the free-running activity rhythm remains close to that of the previous injection schedule for 20-50 cycles. In this paper, we extend these findings and demonstrate that 1) long-term treatment with triazolam can induce aftereffects on the period of the circadian clock underlying the activity rhythm that can last for up to 100 days, 2) triazolam-induced changes in period can lead to a loss of effect of daily injections of triazolam which can be restored if the time of injection is altered, and 3) chronic treatment with triazolam also alters the period of the circadian clock in animals entrained to a light-dark cycle, and such changes in period alter the phase relationship between the circadian clock and the entraining light-dark cycle.", 
    "41": "Human cortex cerebri and cerebelli xenografts from first-trimester fetal tissue fragments were used to study the effects of ethanol on single human central neurons. Transplants were placed into the anterior eye chamber of athymic nude rats and allowed to develop for 3 to 11 months. Immunohistologic analysis revealed graft structures that stained positively for a number of neuronal, transmitter-related, glial and vascular markers. Superfusion of ethanol (EtOH) elicited a reversible and dose-dependent depression of action potential discharge. At least two populations of neurons could be identified--a more sensitive group with an EC50 of 3.0 mM and a less sensitive group with an EC50 of 22.4 mM. These EtOH levels are within the range eliciting behavioral signs of intoxication in humans. EtOH-induced depressions could be antagonized by administration of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 15-4513. This study represents the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of the electrophysiologic actions of EtOH on single neurons from human brain, and provides dose-response data collected with known concentrations of EtOH as well as evidence for the blockade of these EtOH effects by the Roche compound.", 
    "42": "The pharmacokinetics of atracurium, laudanosine and the quaternary alcohol were studied in patients with normal and impaired renal function following intravenous administration of atracurium. Anaesthesia consisted of thiopental, fentanyl, halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Plasma and urine concentrations of the parent compound and its degradation products were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Renal failure was defined as a creatinine clearance of less than 5 ml/min; it caused no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of atracurium but did result in a different pharmacokinetic profile of laudanosine, with a 3-fold increase in the mean ( +/- SD) terminal half-life (176 +/- 84 and 516 +/- 262 minutes for patients with normal and impaired renal function, respectively). Moreover, the half-life of the quaternary alcohol increased from 27.1 +/- 8.3 minutes in patients with normal renal function to 42.5 +/- 8.3 minutes in those with impaired renal function (mean +/- SD). Renal elimination of unchanged atracurium accounted for 11% of the administered dose and at least 27% of the total degradation of atracurium occurred via ester hydrolysis. The neuromuscular function was monitored by measuring the twitch tension of the adductor pollicis muscle elicited by stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 0.1 Hz. The total duration of neuromuscular blockade (51.8 +/- 11.5 minutes) and the recovery index (9.6 +/- 2.0 minutes) are shortened in patients with impaired renal function, compared with those with normal renal function (64.1 +/- 7.2 and 16.7 +/- 4.1 minutes, respectively), indicating that sensitivity to the neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium may be altered by renal failure.",

Group 1 (n = 8) served as a control; group 2 (n = 7) received intrathecally (it) the opioid receptor agonist morphine (500 micrograms); group 3 (n = 7), the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine (200 micrograms it); and group 4 (n = 7), the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (1 mg it). Plasma samples were collected from the adrenal vein at baseline, after it drug administration, and during sciatic nerve stimulation for the measurement of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. In control cats (group 1), sciatic nerve stimulation evoked significant increases in adrenal vein catecholamine plasma levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. Morphine (group 2) did not have any effect on spontaneous hemodynamics and adrenal secretion. During stimulation (group 2), there were no significant increases in adrenal norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations, whereas dopamine concentrations, blood pressure, and heart rate rose significantly. Clonidine (group 3) led to a decrease in heart rate and adrenal vein norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations at baseline. During sciatic nerve stimulation in this group (3), significantly lower concentrations were observed in adrenal vein catecholamines compared with control, whereas the hemodynamic response was not suppressed. Midazolam suppressed baseline and stimulation-evoked adrenal vein catecholamine concentrations, but hemodynamics were not significantly affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The influence of diazepam, midazolam, and flunitrazepam on the antinociceptive effect of morphine, fentanyl, and buprenorphine was studied using the hot-plate test and the tail-flick test in mice. Diazepam and midazolam induced a dose-dependent attenuation of the effect of all three opiates in both tests of nociception. Flunitrazepam antagonized the antinociceptive effect only in the tail-flick test. The benzodiazepine effect could not be explained by altered tail-skin temperature. The antagonism did not correlate well with the sedative or muscle-relaxing properties of the benzodiazepines, and a different mechanism may therefore be involved. It is proposed that the antagonism represents an interaction between benzodiazepines and opioid systems in the brain participating in modulation of nociceptive inputs.", 
    "45": "Quantitative cholescintigraphy using technetium-99m-disofenin was employed to study the kinetics of gallbladder filling and emptying in cats. The radionuclide rapidly visualizes the gallbladder, with activity continuing to rise during the 60 minutes after injection. The gallbladder emptied in a dose-response manner to the intravenous administration of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-OP). An infusion of 10 ng/kg/min of CCK-OP resulted in 75% emptying of the gallbladder at 30 min compared to control. This was significantly greater emptying than with an infusion of either 0.1 or 1.0 ng/kg/min. After administration of a fatty meal, the 30-min gallbladder emptying was 73% of control, similar to the response to CCK-OP at a dose of 10 ng/kg/min. Intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg of L-364,718 (a CCK-receptor antagonist) completely inhibited the gallbladder response to a fatty meal but had no effect on gallbladder filling in the fasting state. These results suggest that feline cholescintigraphy can be used for the quantitative study of gallbladder emptying. While CCK appears to be the primary modulator of gallbladder contraction after a fatty meal, no influence of CCK was detected in the interdigestive (fasting) state.", 
    "46": "Subtypes of muscarinic receptors (possible m1 to m5) can be identified by their molecular size, specific effector systems and antagonist specificity. In membranes prepared from primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard [( 3H]PBCM) irreversibly binds to muscarinic receptive proteins, having two major molecular sizes, 92 and 66 kDa. With relatively short periods of incubation (approx. 30 min, 30 degrees C) of [3H]PBCM with atropine, a nonspecific competitive receptor antagonist, the irreversible labeling of these muscarinic proteins by [3H]PBCM could be prevented. Methoctramine, a specific competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, protected most of the muscarinic receptors having a molecular size of 66 kDa from binding of [3H]PBCM. These 66 kDa receptive proteins are suggested to be muscarinic m2 and m4 subtypes. (-)Quinuclidinyl xanthene-9-carboxylate [(-)QNX], a somewhat specific competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors coupled to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, prevented the binding of [3H]PBCM to 92 kDa muscarinic receptive proteins and some 66 kDa muscarinic receptive proteins. The 92 kDa receptive proteins are suggested to be the muscarinic m3 subtype and the 66 kDa proteins could be either the m2 or m4 receptor subtype. Lastly, pirenzepine, a nonspecific antagonist at muscarinic receptors mediating inhibition of adenylate cyclase and hydrolysis of PI in these cultures, resembled (-)QNX in preventing binding of [3H]PBCM to the 92 kDa receptive proteins and some 66 kDa receptive proteins. The suggested subtypes of muscarinic receptors, specifically bound by pirenzepine should be the m3 (92 kDa) and the m4 (66 kDa) subtypes, since pirenzepine reportedly exhibits a low affinity for the muscarinic m2 subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "In primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, activation of muscarinic receptors stimulates both hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The specificity of three muscarinic receptor antagonists, pirenzepine, methoctramine and (-)quinuclidinyl xanthene-9-carboxylate [(-)QNX], in blocking carbachol-stimulated hydrolysis of PI and inhibition of adenylate cyclase were determined. Pirenzepine was found to be nonspecific in blocking the carbachol-stimulated hydrolysis of PI and inhibition of adenylate cyclase, while methoctramine specifically antagonized carbachol-stimulated inhibition of adenylate cyclase with 600 times greater potency than carbachol-stimulated hydrolysis of PI. (-)Quinuclidinyl xanthene-9-carboxylate was approximately 20 times more potent in blocking the carbachol-stimulated hydrolysis of PI than inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Studies of the ability of these three antagonists to block the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) to muscarinic sites on membranes from cerebellar granule cells, revealed that all three antagonists displayed binding characteristics, characteristic of two binding sites, possibly representing the two types of muscarinic receptors. However, the ratio of the affinities for each of the two binding sites was about ten for pirenzepine, 100 for methoctramine and 650 for (-)QNX. Thus, the specificity of these antagonists, in blocking the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and hydrolysis of PI did not correlate with their specificities obtained with the binding studies with [3H]QNB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "1. The effect of atropine on the nociceptive system was examined in mice and rats by use of the hot-plate, writhing and tail-flick tests. 2. Atropine dose-dependently produced analgesia, no effect and hyperalgesia. Analgesia was observed in both species with doses ranging from 1 to 100 micrograms kg-1 while hyperalgesia was obtained with 5 mg kg-1. 3. Atropine antinociception was prevented by pirenzepine (0.1 microgram per mouse, i.c.v.), dicyclomine (10 mg kg-1, i.p.), atropine-methylbromide (0.5 microgram per mouse, i.c.v.) and hemicholinium-3 (1 microgram per mouse, i.c.v.). Naloxone (1 mg kg-1, i.p.), alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (100 mg kg-1, s.c.) and reserpine (2 mg kg-1, i.p.) were ineffective. 4. The site of atropine analgesia is in the CNS since it exerts its antinociceptive effect also when injected i.c.v. (1-10 ng per mouse). Moreover drugs which do not cross the blood-brain barrier, such as hemicholinium-3, pirenzepine and atropine methylbromide, were unable to antagonize atropine analgesia if administered i.p. 5. Atropine also in vitro, showed a biphasic action on electrically-evoked guinea-pig ileum contractions. Concentrations between 10(-14) and 10(-12) M increased electrically and nicotine-evoked contractions but did not affect acetylcholine- and oxotremorine-evoked contractions. Concentrations above 10(-9) M inhibited both electrically- and drug (acetylcholine, nicotine and oxotremorine)-evoked contractions while they were ineffective on unstimulated ileum. 6. On the basis of the above findings, amplification of cholinergic transmission by very low doses of atropine is postulated, through a selective blockade of presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors, as the likely mechanism of action. 7. Atropine antinociception, unlike oxotremorine antinociception, was obtained without any impairment of mouse rota-rod performance. 8. The antagonism by pirenzepine and dicyclomine of oxotremorine and atropine antinociception suggests that M1 muscarinic receptor subtypes are responsible for cholinergic analgesia.", 
    "49": "In this work, we have carried out a stereological and ultrastructural study in order to verify the action of pirenzepine on regenerating parietal cells. We have used a control group and operated or nonoperated groups treated with 1, 5 and 25 mg/kg/day pirenzepine. In operated groups an ulcer was provoked by cauterization with a metallic plate in the gastric fundus. Parietal cells in operated groups showed mitochondria with altered crests, a fine granular matrix and a large number of tubulo-vesicles. The comparative stereological analysis demonstrates a generalized decrease in the mitochondria, canaliculi and lysosomal volume density, and an increase in the tubulo-vesicle volume density. Changes detected in these cellular structures would originate a decrease in the production of HCl [correction of ClH].",

All patients were free from endocrine and metabolic disease undergoing elective low risk operation. Pethidine 1 mg/kg i.m. and benzodiazepine 0.01 mg/kg p.o. were given as premedication one hour before anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental 4 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg for tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% isoflurane and 50% N2O in oxygen. Ventilation was controlled and adjusted to maintain an end-tidal CO2 concentration of 25-35 torr. Atracurium 0.4 mg/kg was given as muscle relaxant. Blood samples were obtained from radial arterial catheter, 15 minutes before induction of anesthesia and 5 min after anesthesia, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min during operation and 30 min after operation in postanesthesia recovery room. The results showed that there were no statistically significant changes in plasma levels of NPY and catecholamines during operation underwent isoflurane anesthetic technique. This result indicates that isoflurane anesthesia can block the plasma NPY as well as catecholamines during surgical stress.",

The drug was administered at two easily recognizable time points in the course of the encephalopathy: first, when the righting reflex was disturbed, and second, when the animal could no longer achieve to the sitting position. The response after flumazenil did not differ from that after the placebo, as measured by clinical evaluation and automated EEG analysis. Furthermore, the progression of the encephalopathy, as measured by the survival time after the first injection, was not affected by flumazenil.", 
    "52": "Organic cosolvents are used in many intramuscular formulations for solubilization of drugs and have been shown to cause skeletal muscle damage (myotoxicity). This study explored the influence of organic cosolvent-induced myotoxicity on the bioavailability of a model compound, diazepam. A tracer (C14) dose of diazepam was selected which did not elicit any systemic pharmacologic effects (viz., hypothermia and sedation) that might alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Male New Zealand White rabbits were injected with diazepam dissolved in three cosolvent: water mixtures (20% v/v propylene glycol, 20% v/v polyethylene glycol 400, and 50% v/v polyethylene glycol 400). These mixtures have similar physicochemical properties, but vary 10-fold in their in vitro myotoxicity. Using plasma total radioactivity following intramuscular administration of diazepam, statistical differences were not detected in the area under the curve (AUC), the peak concentration, and the time of the observed peak concentration among these treatments, although the in vivo myotoxicity of these systems (measured by the plasma creatine kinase AUC) varied by 10-fold (p less than 0.01). Limited data on unchanged diazepam levels confirmed these observations. Thus, the degree of skeletal muscle damage caused by these organic cosolvent systems does not seem to affect the bioavailability of a tracer dose of intramuscular diazepam.",

In one episode, in which reading was not interrupted, jerks were followed by a generalized convulsive seizure. EEG with routine activating procedures was normal, while EEG recorded during reading showed bilaterally synchronous paroxysmal small-voltage spikes, more prominent in frontocentral regions, coinciding with jaw myoclonus.

    "54": "The effects of subcutaneously administered scopolamine and diazepam on simultaneous as well as delayed light-dark discrimination behavior were studied in a Y-maze situation using rats. In simultaneous discrimination behavior, running responses to the lighted side of either the right or left arm of the Y-maze were regarded as correct choices. In delayed discrimination behavior, running responses to the lighted side at several delay times (0. 2, 4, and 8 sec) after extinguishment of the light were regarded as correct choices. In the saline test, the percentage of correct choices decreased as the delay time was extended. Scopolamine at 0.03 mg/kg decreased the percentage of correct choices as the delay time was extended within the range of 0 sec through 4 sec. Diazepam both at 1 mg/kg and at 2 mg/kg decreased the percentage at the delay times of 0, 2, and 4 sec but this decreasing effect was not dependent on the delay time. The same doses of these drugs had no effect on simultaneous discrimination behavior. These results suggest that scopolamine at 0.03 mg/kg and diazepam both at 1 mg/kg and at 2 mg/kg disrupt delayed discrimination behavior in different ways.", 
    "55": "The present studies examined the effects of chronic posttest treatment with the antipanic agent alprazolam (ALP) or the traditional anxiolytic agents chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and phenobarbital (PhB) on conflict behavior. In daily ten-minute sessions, water-deprived rats were trained to drink from a tube which was occasionally electrified (0.25 or 0.5 mA). Electrification was signalled by a tone. Chronic ALP (10 mg/kg/day), CDP (40 mg/kg/day), PhB (80 mg/kg/day) or vehicle were injected IP after conflict testing (in some experiments again 12-16 hours later) for a minimum of 6 weeks. Chronic ALP (but not CDP or PhB) resulted in a time-dependent increase in punished responding, with a latency to onset of 3-4 weeks; this effect was not antagonized by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788. These data support the hypothesis that conflict paradigms may serve as animal models for the study of antipanic agents. Moreover, these data suggest that not all anxiolytics will exhibit antipanic efficacy.",

    "57": "The regional, intraarterial, injection of CCK-8 elicits reciprocal effects on the motility of the extrahepatic biliary tree in the cat: the contraction of the gallbladder and a relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi as well as of the duodenal wall. After neural blockade with tetrodotoxin the responses of the sphincter to CCK-8 were blocked, and the responses of the gallbladder were markedly reduced. After the regional administration of a VIP antiserum the sphincter relaxation in response to CCK-8 was blocked. Immunocytochemically it was demonstrated that the feline sphincter contains a rich VIP-ergic innervation, while CCK-like immunoreactivity was found only in mucosal endocrine cells. The results indicate that CCK-8 selectively activates inhibitory VIP neurons innervating the sphincter. After the administration of a nonpeptide CCK-receptor antagonist, the CCK-8 induced motor responses of both the sphincter and the gallbladder were markedly reduced. This indicates that blockade of CCK-8 receptors involves muscular as well as neural CCK-receptors.",

The infusion regimen of midazolam was as follows; an initial infusion of 0.68 mg.kg-1.hr-1 for 15 min followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.125 mg.kg-1.hr-1, and about 30 min before the end of operation infusion was stopped. Fentanyl and pancuronium were injected as required. During operation, blood pressure and heart rate were stable with a small dose of nicardipine. Total dose of fentanyl was the same as in NLA. Extubation was done as quickly as in NLA, after aminophylline infusion which was said to reverse midazolam. In the recovery room, patients were asleep and snored. But they opened eyes and responded to verbal command. Respiratory rate and PaCO2 were in normal ranges.

EEG was recorded first for about 15 minutes at rest with eyes closed, followed by intravenous injection of 10 mg diazepam. At the end of the test, the antagonist, RO 15-1788 0.5-0.8 mg was administered. Slow waves and alpha waves were frequently found at rest with eyes closed. After diazepam administration, however, power spectrum percent in rapid waves (13-17.5 Hz) mainly consisting of beta waves increased from 8.0 +/- 1.3% (mean +/- SE) to 19.9 +/- 2.2%. These changes were statistically significant (P less than 0.05). At the end of procedures RO 15-1788 was administered and percent of power spectrum in beta waves decreased from 17.4 +/- 2.8% to 9.5 +/- 1.5%. These changes were also statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The sedative effect of diazepam may be evaluated by monitoring these rapid waves since the antagonizing effect of RO 15-1788 is demonstrated on EEG.", 
    "61": "The efficacy and general safety of flumazenil (YM684), a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, have been evaluated. Forty-seven patients scheduled for surgery under lumbar spinal or epidural anesthesia with diazepam sedation received flumazenil at the end of the procedure. Criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation and antegrade amnesia. Before injection all patients were heavily sedated with the mean dose of 27 mg of diazepam (range 10-50 mg). After the mean dose of 0.21 mg of flumazenil (range 0.2-0.4 mg), all patients were awake or drowsy within 1-6 min but sedation recurred in one patient 1 hour later. The amnesia was eliminated by flumazenil in 34 patients (72%). No serious side-effects or hemodynamic changes were observed after flumazenil. It is concluded that flumazenil is an effective antagonist of sedation induced by diazepam.", 
    "62": "The effective dose, usefulness and side effects of flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, have been investigated in 72 sleeping patients after the end of the surgical operation who had received flunitrazepam 0.03 mg.kg-1, a long acting benzodiazepine. The patients received intravenous injections of flumazenil 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg per person as initial doses. Four minutes after the injection of flumazenil, the percentages of the patients who were awake, were 47.4% in 0.1 mg group, 82.4% in 0.2 mg group, 82.4% in 0.4 mg group and 88.2% in 0.8 mg group respectively. There were several side effects observed in all the groups except 0.2 mg group. However, they presented no clinical problems. Therefore, flumazenil 0.2 mg as the initial dose, is considered appropriate.", 
    "63": "The blood sample records of all 1,231 blood samples of female DWI-offenders submitted to the D\u00fcsseldorf Institute of Forensic Medicine in 1986/87 were analysed for date and time arrest, age, additional drug intake. BAC and results of medical examination. The data obtained were compared to a randomly selected male comparison group and to the situation in the sixties. The proportion of women arrested for impaired driving has increased from 1.75% in the sixties to 7.5% in 1986/87 (factor 4.3), the percentage of highly intoxicated women (BAC above 2.5 g/l) from 0.07% to 0.55% (factor 7.9). Current female DWI behavior is quite similar to male with both groups mainly comprising highly intoxicated young subjects apprehended on the days of the weekend in the hours around midnight. Women more often admit additional drug intake with benzodiazepine abuse representing a major problem. As concluded from time of arrest, discrepancy between BAC and degree of drunkeness and blood methanol levels about 60% of the women with a BAC above 2.5 g/l have to be classified as chronic alcoholics. As a consequence female alcoholics are significantly overrepresented in female DWI-delinquency.", 
    "64": "Benzodiazepine derivates can cause transient global amnesia even when administered in therapeutical doses. As amnesia seems to be more frequent than supposed, it is relevant for traffic medicine. We shall discuss forensic cases in which Midazolam amnesia was suspected with special attention to the interpretation of toxicological data.", 
    "65": "A three-process model of chronic pain comprising tissue damage, anxiety, and depression is hypothesized. Within this model, the effectiveness of flurbiprofen (for analgesia) plus either alprazolam (for anxiety and depression) or placebo was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial with a single crossover. Flurbiprofen was found to have a significant analgesic effect but this was not enhanced by combining it with alprazolam.", 
    "66": "We have examined the effect of synthetic human cholecystokinin (CCK-33 and CCK-8) on pancreatic blood flow and protein output in anesthetized dogs. Human CCK-33 and CCK-8 increased pancreatic blood flow and protein output in a dose-related manner. There were no significant differences in increasing pancreatic blood flow between human CCK-33 and CCK-8, and increases in blood flow were closely related to the increase of the pancreatic enzyme secretion. L-364,718 (20 nmol/kg) caused a potent inhibition of CCK-stimulated pancreatic blood flow as well as protein output. The degree of inhibition by L-364,718 was dependent on the amount of CCK infused. This study demonstrates that increasing effect on pancreatic blood flow may be one of the biological actions of CCK mediated via CCK receptor. The CCK-33, one of longer molecular forms of CCK, is an important biological stimulator of pancreatic blood flow as well as of exocrine pancreatic secretion.", 
    "67": "Two studies compared alprazolam and imipramine in the treatment of school refusal. In an open label study (N = 17), two-thirds of the subjects completing a trial in both the alprazolam and imipramine groups showed moderate to marked global improvement in symptoms of anxiety and depression. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 24), posttreatment scores calculated as change from baseline on the Anxiety Rating for Children were significantly different (p = .03) among the three treatment groups, with the active medication groups showing the most improvement. Additionally, on all depression rating scales, similar trends were evident with the alprazolam and imipramine groups demonstrating greater improvement than the placebo group. However, analyses of covariance (with pretreatment scores as the covariates) showed no significant differences among the three treatment groups on change in anxiety and depression scales. Thus, additional research is needed to determine whether trends in this study are explained by drug effect or baseline differences on rating scales.", 
    "68": "The pharmacokinetics of nitrazepam and temazepam were investigated in 16 healthy volunteers before and after seven days of the administration of rifampin 600 mg/d and/or probenecid 500 mg/d. In order to determine the endoplasmatic reticulum enzyme function, 6-beta-hydroxycortisol excretion and antipyrine pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated. After the administration of rifampin, the total body clearance of antipyrine and nitrazepam increased by 87% and 83%, respectively. After the combined treatment with rifampin and probenecid, the elimination of the two drugs was also increased, even though to a lesser extent (33%, 31%). After the administration of probenecid only, the total clearances of antipyrine and nitrazepam were decreased by 22% and 25%, respectively. The urinary clearance of the antipyrine metabolites also decreased. In norantipyrine and 4-OH-antipyrine, this was due to a significant reduction of glucuronide fraction (211 +/- 32 to 159 +/- 26 mg, and 259 +/- 39 to 191 +/- 25 mg). The sulphate fraction of norantipyrine increased by 18% and that of 4-OH-antipyrine by 21%. Apart from a reduced excretion of the glucuronide fraction, the pharmacokinetics of temazepam were neither altered significantly by probenecid nor by rifampin. According to the outcome of this investigation, probenecid seems to bring about not merely an inhibition of phase II but also an inhibition of phase I metabolization.", 
    "69": "In a study of AIDS-related risk behaviour among injecting drug users in the north west of England it was found that 90% were polydrug users, and 28% were using temazepam. A third of all polydrug users had regularly used more than three drugs in addition to their preferred drug in the previous year. Statistical analysis revealed that the use of temazepam and extensive polydrug use were associated with sharing injecting equipment. Significant associations were also found with indices of sexual risk behaviour. It was concluded that multiple drug use and the use of temazepam were associated with behaviour that could increase exposure to HIV infection.", 
    "70": "1. The effects of zolpidem 20 mg, flunitrazepam 2 mg and placebo, administered at bed time, were studied in 12 healthy young male volunteers. 2. The assessments included, at awakening, subjective ratings of overnight sleep, cognitive function, psychomotor performance (digit symbol substitution, choice reaction time, flicker fusion threshold), subjective ratings of alertness, and plasma assay of residual drug concentration. Daytime sleep propensity during the day after dosing was evaluated with the multiple sleep latency test. 3. Compared with placebo, both active drugs improved subjective assessment of the ease of getting to sleep. At awakening, under flunitrazepam treatment, the reduction of performance, on memory and psychomotor tests, paralleled an increased subjective rating of sleepiness, but zolpidem treatment left subjects unimpaired compared with placebo. Similarly, daytime sleep propensity was enhanced throughout the following day under flunitrazepam treatment, but not under zolpidem treatment. Plasma assay for residual drug concentration at awakening found significant amounts of flunitrazepam and marginal amounts of zolpidem. 4. Results indicate that zolpidem 20 mg is devoid of residual effects in a range of tasks that were sensitive enough to demonstrate a prolonged wakefulness impairment following flunitrzepam 2 mg in healthy volunteers.", 
    "71": "Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for elderly patients living in the community and for those in hospitals and institutions. Their use is more prevalent in women. Prolonged use of benzodiazepines is particularly likely in old age for the treatment not only of insomnia and anxiety, but also of a wide range of nonspecific symptoms. Long term users are likely to have multiple concomitant physical and psychological health problems. The distinction between benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics is difficult and somewhat arbitrary, since the differences between the compounds are less than their similarities, especially in respect of adverse reactions. Despite their wide therapeutic range, elderly patients are particularly prone to adverse reactions to benzodiazepines. The incidence of unwanted effects, predominantly manifestations of central nervous system depression, has been found to be significantly increased in hospitalised elderly patients, particularly in the frail elderly. Studies on unwanted effects during long term use are scarce, but there is some evidence of tolerance to side effects. However, benzodiazepines have been found to be frequently implicated in drug-associated hospital admissions. There is suggestive evidence that benzodiazepines, especially compounds with long half-lives, may contribute to the falls which are a major health problem in old age. The incidence of benzodiazepine dependence in elderly patients is unknown. The features of benzodiazepine withdrawal in the elderly may differ from those seen in young patients; withdrawal symptoms include confusion and disorientation which often does not precipitate milder reactions such as anxiety, insomnia and perceptual changes. Problems due to both adverse reactions and to benzodiazepine withdrawal may easily be overlooked in multimorbid elderly patients, particularly in those suffering from disorders of the central nervous system. There are numerous studies on benzodiazepine pharmacokinetics indicating that alterations, especially in distribution and elimination of certain compounds, occur in old age. Benzodiazepines with oxidative metabolic pathways and longer half-lives are likely to accumulate with regular administration. However, changes in pharmacodynamics may be more important to explain altered responses to benzodiazepines in the elderly. Although information on pharmacodynamics is still limited, there is convincing evidence of increased pharmacodynamic response in the elderly which may be further accentuated by disease factors. Since the variability of pharmacological response increases with age and is not always predictable, there is good reason at least to start therapy at lower doses and to titrate dosages individually. This may also be appropriate for the newer benzodiazepines, irrespective of advantageous pharmacokinetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "72": "In children there is a good effect of diazepam on convulsions after intravenous or rectal administration. This is not the case in neonates. We describe a newborn to whom diazepam was given because of a convulsion and who exhibited serious side effects: coma, hypotonia and feeding difficulties. We point out the risks of using diazepam in neonates.", 
    "73": "Since children's intellectual perception is limited, the preoperative visit by an anesthesiologist alone can rarely help to free the small patients from fear and restlessness prior to elective surgery. In order to relieve anxiety which should be the primary goal of premedication in any patient - children need anxiolytic premedication agents. Drugs for premedication administered by intramuscular or rectal route in children often cause pain, fear and discomfort. The present study was performed in order to investigate oral given midazolam in the premedication of children with special regard to the practical suitability of this method. 100 children, 0.5 to 10 years of age (group A: 0.5-4 years, group B: 5-10 years) undergoing elective urological surgery received 0.4 mg/kg midazolam orally about 20 minutes prior to the arrival in the operation unit. After insertion of a venous cannula into a forearm vein anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained by inhalation with Isoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen (fi O2:0.3). Degree of sedation, state of mind and behaviour (for 100 children) as well as blood pressure and heart rate (separately for group A and B) were registered preoperatively at defined, comparable and representative circumstances. Side effects prior and during induction phase of anesthesia were documented. The personal data are representative for a normal population of children with typical urological diseases. Oral administered midazolam had only a mild or non sedative effect in 76-84% of the children 70-84% of the small patients showed an indifferent or euphoric state of mind and 67-88% behaved cooperatively or passively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Tardive dyskinesia is a disorder secondary to prolonged treatment (from 18 months to 3 years) with antipsychotic agents, affecting approximately 15% to 20% of patients. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by difficulty controlling involuntary movements of the small muscle groups, producing tic-like reactions, muscle rigidity, and difficulty maintaining muscle tone. It is a chronic and unrelenting disorder which may be permanent if not successfully treated. The mechanism of action is thought to be secondary to dopamine hypersensitivity resulting from prolonged deprivation of dopamine on the part of dopamine-sensitive receptors. Theoretically, these receptors have been deprived of the neurotransmitter by chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs, which are recognized as dopamine-blocking agents. We present a case in which alprazolam was successfully used in treating tardive dyskinesia.", 
    "75": "Buspirone, an azapirone derivative and a 5-HT1A partial agonist, is the first nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic introduced into medicine for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. A series of well-controlled clinical trials demonstrated that its anxiolytic properties were similar to those of various benzodiazepines and significantly better than placebo. More recently, antidepressant effects were also observed. Patients with clinical indications for which buspirone seems to be particularly appropriate are those with generalized anxiety disorder, those with chronic anxiety, the anxious elderly, and, perhaps, many patients of all ages who suffer from mixed symptoms of anxiety and depression. Studies conducted with patients suffering from panic disorder have so far been inconclusive, and thus buspirone is, for the present at least, not recommended for routine treatment of panic disorder. Buspirone seems to be most helpful in anxious patients who do not demand immediate gratification or the immediate relief they associate with the benzodiazepine response. Slower and more gradual onset of anxiety relief is balanced by the increased safety and lack of dependency-producing aspects of buspirone. Finally, whether or not buspirone may possess \"curative\" properties, in addition to \"anxiety-suppressant\" properties, that allow the patient to improve coping skills with time requires further exploration.", 
    "76": "A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to determine the safety of concurrently using buspirone with alprazolam before and during a gradual tapering of the alprazolam dose. Thirty-six patients received placebo t.i.d. and 36 received buspirone 5 mg. t.i.d. Findings included significantly greater anxiety (as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) in the placebo group and significantly reduced manifestations of abstinence (as measured by the Abstinence Rating Scale) in the buspirone group. Buspirone and alprazolam may be used together safely, and buspirone may be started early in the alprazolam tapering process.", 
    "77": "Two hundred thirty patients with generalized anxiety and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) scores greater than or equal to 18 were subdivided at random, according to a double-blind design, into one group treated with 5-10 mg of oral buspirone t.i.d. or one group treated with 10-20 mg of oral oxazepam t.i.d. for 6 weeks. No anxiolytic treatment was allowed 3 months prior to trial entry. Analysis of demographic variables revealed no significant imbalance between the two treatment groups. Twenty patients were excluded from efficacy analysis because of treatment withdrawal before the first efficacy evaluation on Day 7. Another 4 patients were excluded because they were taking concomitant psychotropic medication. The remaining 206 patients displayed a decrease in HAM-A scores (mean +/- SD) from 23.9 +/- 4.1 to 10.6 +/- 7.7 in the buspirone group and from 23.9 +/- 4.2 to 11.5 +/- 8.0 in the oxazepam group. The two treatment groups were also found to be virtually identical in an \"intent to treat\" analysis of all 230 patients as well as in other ratings (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Raskin Depression Scale, Covi Anxiety Scale, Physicians Questionnaire, global ratings, and Hopkins Symptom Checklist [HSCL]-56). However, oxazepam was never superior to buspirone in any of the efficacy analyses. Of the 230 patients, 127 spontaneously reported adverse events, including drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and nervousness. Adverse events were relatively similar in the two groups. In conclusion, buspirone and oxazepam appear to be equally effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety encountered by general practitioners. This outcome, in addition to a previously documented absence of any dependency liability, makes buspirone a clinically important anxiolytic drug."
