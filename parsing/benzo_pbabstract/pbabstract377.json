A prospective study was performed to determine the prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use in orthopedic trauma patients at an inner-city teaching hospital. All patients admitted to the orthopedic service during a 2-year period (January 1993 to December 1994) were prospectively studied. Patients < 14 years old were excluded. Blood alcohol levels were determined, and the urine was screened for cocaine, opiates, marijuana, barbiturates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and phencyclidine. Demographic data and a medical history were obtained. Seven hundred sixty-six patients met the study parameters. Of these, 628 (82%) had complete drug and alcohol screens available for review. The data were then sorted by diagnosis, mechanism of injury, type of injury (closed versus open), length of inpatient stay, age, sex, and race, and a statistical analysis was performed. The overall incidence of positive drug or alcohol tests was 56%. Twenty-four percent of patients tested positive for two or more drugs, and 9% for three or more. Alcohol (25%) was the most commonly detected drug, followed by cocaine (22%) and marijuana (21%). The highest incidence of drug use was found in males and in those ages 31-40 years. Hospital stay averaged 1.3 days longer in patients with positive screens. Patients with tibia fractures or open fractures, and those injuries sustained by gunshot, altercation, or pedestrian versus motor vehicle accident had the highest incidence of positive screens. These data show that drug-using patients have more severe orthopedic injuries (i.e., open fractures) and require longer hospitalizations. We conclude that drug and alcohol use is widespread in patients presenting with orthopedic injuries and we make recommendations regarding treatment of these patients. The majority of orthopedic trauma resources in this setting is devoted to treating intoxicated patients. Drug and alcohol use is a major social problem and may have an adverse effect on patient care.", 
    "1": "Central cholinergic (ACh) blockade produces profound cognitive impairments in human and animal subjects. Our previous research demonstrated that ACh blockade exacerbates stress-induced adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) secretion, and increases anxiety-like behavior (ALB) in rats. The fact that all these responses occur following the same manipulation led us to question whether or not increases in ALB might play a part in the cognitive deficits. This issue was all the more intriguing given that anxiolytic agents such as benzodiazepines are reported to produce learning and memory impairments on their own. We reasoned that a low dose of diazepam (DZP) with no apparent cognitive effects itself, might be able to antagonize an impairment induced by scopolamine (SCOP). Adult male Lister rats (n = 6/group) were administered IP either vehicle (VEH), 0.5 mg/kg DZP, 0.25 mg/kg SCOP, or 0.5 mg/kg DZP, followed 20 min later by 0.25 mg/kg SCOP, and tested 20 min later in a water maze for latency to locate a hidden platform and for path length taken to the platform. Rats were tested in an acquisition phase (Day 1) and a retention phase (Day 2), as well as on a visually guided task. On Day 1, SCOP produced a marked acquisition deficit that was unaffected by DZP. DZP by itself had no obvious effect. However, whereas SCOP resulted in a persistent deficit on the retention task (Day 2), pretreatment with DZP prior to SCOP on Day 1 completely abolished the impairment. There were no group differences on the visually cued task. We contend that SCOP-induced cognitive deficits may, in part, be due to increases in ALB. Stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors may offset the loss of cholinergic systems underlying consolidation mechanisms, but not those mediating immediate task performance. Whether this effect of DZP relates to an action on ALB remains to be elucidated.", 
    "2": "Physiologic and psychologic changes associated with sleep disturbance decrease the ability of a critically ill child to adapt to hospitalization and thus hamper recovery. Research demonstrates that intensive care settings interfere with sleep of adults, but little is known about the impact of these settings on children's sleep. An exploratory field study was conducted to describe the sleep-wake patterns of 1- and 2-year-old children in intensive care, identify intensive care environmental stimuli associated with sleep and waking states, compare the intensive care sleep-wake pattern to the pre-illness sleep-wake pattern, and determine the time required for children to return to their pre-illness sleep-wake pattern. Twelve children aged 13 to 35 months composed the sample for the study. Pre-illness and postdischarge sleep patterns, sleep patterns during a 12-hour night in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and external and internal environmental stimuli were measured. Prior to hospitalization, subjects demonstrated sleep similar to that documented in healthy children. Children in the PICU experienced a significant loss of sleep, frequent awakenings, and a virtual rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation. External environmental stimuli of light, noise, and caregiver activity were negatively correlated with sleep state. Pain and treatment with benzodiazepines were associated with sleep acquisition. Sleep changes persisted after discharge from the PICU and the hospital. Total sleep time recovered more rapidly than nighttime awakening. Parents perceived that their child's sleep remained different longer than total sleep time and night awakening values demonstrated.", 
    "3": "Longitudinal studies in naturalistic settings have shed new light on the course and value of therapeutic interventions in panic disorder and agoraphobia. Patients, their families, and clinicians need additional information about the natural course of the disorders and the factors that predispose patients to sustained illness, recovery, and relapse during treatment and upon treatment discontinuation. Clinical experience and controlled studies confirm the efficacy of pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Newer antidepressants, especially the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, represent a significant advance in effective pharmacologic intervention. However, despite the availability of effective treatment options, panic disorder often remains a chronic condition characterized by intermittent remissions and relapses over many years. Depression and comorbid anxiety disorders are associated with increased disease severity, treatment refractoriness, and relapse. The role of CBT as both a primary intervention and as an aid in the discontinuation of pharmacotherapy is reviewed.", 
    "4": "Alteration in the function of the GABAA receptor complex and its relation to changes in withdrawal signs in diazepam (DZP)-dependent rats were studied. Physical dependence on DZP was induced in male F344 rats by using the drug-admixed food method. After cessation of treatment, withdrawal signs such as spontaneous convulsions were observed and withdrawal scores were maximal at 39 approximately 45 hr after the DZP withdrawal. Furthermore, these withdrawal signs almost disappeared by 159 approximately 168 hr after the DZP withdrawal. GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into cerebral cortical membrane vesicles was significantly decreased in rats 0 hr after DZP withdrawal and significantly increased in rats 42 hr after DZP withdrawal compared with control rats Flunitrazepam (FZ)-induced potentiation and an antagonistic effect of Ro 15-1788 on GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx were observed in control rats. No FZ-potentiated GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx was observed in rats 0 hr after DZP withdrawal: however, such an effect of FZ was recognized in rats 42 hr and 162 hr after DZP withdrawal. No antagonistic effect of Ro15-1788 on the FZ-induced stimulation was recognized in rats 0 hr and 42 hr after DZP withdrawal but was recognized at 162 hr after DZP treatment, although it was not significant. In a [3H]FZ assay of binding to benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. Bmax values were significantly decreased in rats 0 hr after DZP withdrawal, but increased at 42 hr after DZP withdrawal, compared with control rats Bmax had almost returned to the control level at 162 hr after DZP treatment rats. In conclusion, these results indicate that functional changes in the GABAA/BZ receptor/CI- channel complex, i.e. increased sensitivity in GABAA receptors and impairment in the functional coupling between BZ receptors and GABAA receptors, may possibly be involved in the biochemical mechanism of the severe withdrawal symptoms appearing after chronic treatment with DZP.", 
    "5": "The present study tests the hypothesis that the changes in myocardial lactate metabolism in the early period of coronary surgery are caused by raised adrenergic activity, and that these are preventable by the addition of thoracolumbar epidural blockade to high dose fentanyl/midazolam anesthesia. Twenty-seven male beta 1-blocked patients undergoing coronary surgery were included in a prospective, controlled, randomized study. High dose fentanyl/midazolam anesthesia alone (control) or supplemented with thoracolumbar epidural blockade (treatment) was used. Measurements were performed before the induction of anesthesia and after sternotomy. After sternotomy adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) had decreased and were both in the low range, especially in the epidural group (P < 0.01). Arterial pressures decreased in both groups, especially in the epidural group, where coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) decreased from 61 (42-88) to 48 (33-64) mm Hg; Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased with 30% in the epidural group (P < 0.01), but not significantly in the control group. The myocardial fractional extraction of lactate decreased in both groups, from 33 (10-45) to 13 (0-42)% in the control group (P < 0.01), and from 36 (19-43) to 10 (2-20)% in the epidural group. It is concluded that high dose fentanyl/midazolam anesthesia prevents hyperadrenergic activity in the early phase of coronary surgery, but cannot eliminate changes in myocardial lactate metabolism. The addition of the thoracolumbar epidural blockade to high dose fentanyl/midazolam anesthesia offers no obvious benefits in the early phase of coronary surgery.", 
    "6": "The interaction of Ro15-4513 (5 mg/kg) with ethanol (3 g/kg, 60%w/v bolus) in dogs was investigated. Ro15-4513 challenge 120 minutes after a single ethanol dose had no significant effect on blood ethanol concentration or heart rate. In the same experiment, (1) blood acetaldehyde concentration was elevated to more than double the control value (vehicle only, no Ro15-4513), and (2) systolic blood pressure decreased to less than 60% of control. Further investigation revealed: (1) after Ro15-4513, area under the blood acetaldehyde vs time curve was more than twofold greater (p = 0.0006) than control, and the area under the systolic blood pressure vs time curve was 76% (p = 0.0027) of control. Based on these results, we propose that an inter-relationship exists between Ro15-4513, blood acetaldehyde concentration, and systolic blood pressure in ethanol intoxicated dogs.", 
    "7": "Zolpidem, a new imidazo-pyridine hypnotic, acts like a benzodiazepine. Because of its short half-life, zolpidem plays a special role in the group of drugs suitable for anesthesiological premedication because of its sedative and anxiolytic effects. The study compared preanesthesiological treatment by zolpidem and phenobarbital in combination with promethazine in a clinical setting. In a double-blind randomized design, 304 patients awaiting different kinds of surgery were studied. For the assessment of emotional states, a multidimensional rating scale was administered. The study showed differing effects of zolpidem and phenobarbital, which could be demonstrated in the scales 'irritation', 'vulnerability', and 'aggression' and could therefore represent in domain hostility. In most of the other scales there were similar effects of phenobarbital and zolpidem. Assuming that phenobarbital is a potent sedative, the reported results confirm the results found by other authors, that zolpidem also acts as a sedative. The reported results describe promethazine as selectively deactivating. These results are in agreement with the findings of an experimental study which tested the acute effects of stress under promethazine.", 
    "8": "Principle goals of sedation for eye surgery are to provide patient comfort and to allow the patient to stay calm during both retrobulbar injection and surgery. Insufficient sedation may not prevent the patient from moving during retrobulbar injection, whereas very deep sedation may result in respiratory complications during surgery. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and suitability of a combination of diazepam and propofol for sedation for both application of retrobulbar block and subsequent elective eye surgery. One-hundred and fifty patients were randomly allocated to receive either diazepam, propofol or a combination of both drugs before retrobulbar injection. Tolerance of retrobulbar injection and comfort during the surgical procedure were assessed by comfort scores using a nominal analogue scale between 1 (worst possible condition) and 6 (best conceivable condition). Side effects related to sedation were recorded. The combination of diazepam and propofol resulted in the highest comfort scores for both retrobulbar block (5.3 +/- 0.3) and the surgical procedure (5.4 +/- 0.4). Diazepam alone did not produce adequate sedation for retrobulbar block (3.1 +/- 0.3), whereas comfort scores during surgery were significantly higher (5.3 +/- 0.3) compared to propofol alone (3.6 +/- 0.4). No severe side effects induced by sedation were noted in any of the study groups. The combination of diazepam and propofol proved able to provide a reliable degree of sedation with minimal side effects for both retrobulbar block and surgery. The combination was clearly superior to the sedation induced by propofol or diazepam alone.",

All patients were receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The given doses of vecuronium and pancuronium are equieffective with respect to duration of neuromuscular blockade.", 
    "11": "During a 25-min experimental period following the administration of the randomly selected drug, no significant changes in the haemodynamic parameters were observed in the vecuronium group. The administration of pancuronium, however, resulted in a significant mean increase in heart rate (20%), rate-pressure product (23%) and cardiac index (21%). Following endotracheal intubation in the pancuronium group, we observed an additional significant increase in mean arterial pressure and rate-pressure product.",

Ketorolac tromethamine has few sedative effects and no respiratory depression. The purpose of this study was to compare ketorolac to meperidine as adjuncts in conscious sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EDG).", 
    "14": "Patients undergoing diagnostic EGD (n = 47) were randomly assigned to receive normal saline solution or 50 mg meperidine or 30 mg ketorolac intravenously. Midazolam was subsequently administered (as needed, to achieve adequate conscious sedation) by endoscopists who were blinded to the test substance given before the procedure.", 
    "15": "For all treatment groups, there was no significant difference in extent or adequacy of sedation, incidence of oxygen desaturation, patient amnesia, time of procedure, or vital signs (except for a relative procedural tachycardia in the ketorolac and placebo groups as compared to baseline). The ketorolac group experienced more pain and anxiety. The meperidine group experienced less gagging, a shorter sedation time, less midazolam usage, and more discomfort at the intravenous site. Meperidine seemed to offer a \"protective\" effect against procedural tachycardia.",

Particular interest was directed to the anxiolytic effect of this benzodiazapine. Midazolam proved to be an effective sedative and anxiolytic drug with no remarkable effects on vigilance and cooperation during induction of anaesthesia. Midazolam was well accepted by the patients and showed only slight side-effects.", 
    "18": "Prolonged occupancy of GABAA receptors by ligands, including GABA and benzodiazepine agonists, sets in motion a series of mechanisms that can be termed use-dependent regulation. These mechanisms can be subdivided into two distinct pathways, one for GABAA receptor downregulation and another for upregulation. Treatment of cortical neurons with GABA or benzodiazepines in cultures opens the pathway for GABAA receptor downregulation, which includes (in putative temporal order): (1) desensitization (tachyphylaxis), (2) sequestration (endocytosis) of subunit polypeptides and uncoupling of allosteric interactions between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites, (3) subunit polypeptide degradation, and (4) repression of subunit gene expression. The end-point of GABAA receptor downregulation, a reduction in receptor number, is postulated to be established initially by degradation of the receptor protein and then maintained by a diminished level of de novo synthesis. Benzodiazepine treatment of many preparations, including cells expressing recombinant GABAA receptors, may elicit only desensitization, sequestration, or uncoupling, without a decline in receptor number. Components of the GABAA receptor downregulation pathway are also evoked by chronic administration of GABAmimetics, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and neurosteroids in animals. This downregulation correlates with the establishment of tolerance to and physical dependence on the pharmacological effects of these drugs, suggesting a cellular model for this behavior. The upregulation of GABAA receptors is observed as one of the neurotrophic actions of GABA, primarily in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Upregulation in culture is caused by enhanced expression of genes for GABAA receptor subunits and correlates with the establishment of GABAergic circuitry in the developing cerebellum. Thus, both the upregulation and downregulation of GABAA receptors appear to represent use-dependent pathways for guiding synaptic plasticity in the vertebrate central nervous system.",

    "23": "A wide variation in the performance of inbred rats measured in the evaluated plus maze test suggests a possible genetic basis for anxiety response (AR). To gain further insight into the role of genetics in AR, we have characterized AR in male outbred S-D rats. Rats were placed in the black compartment (BC) facing the wall opposite the aperture and time needed for the animal to exit BC was noted. All rats underwent 3 successive trials 1-1.5 hrs apart. Naive rats showed a wide variation in their AR in trial 1(mean = 89 +/- 19 sec, range = 5-360 sec). Sixty-eight% of the rats exhibiting low AR exited BC in < 30 sec, whereas 16% stayed in for the entire 360 sec (high AR). On successive testing, there was a progressive increase in AR which reached to max on second trial (Trial 1: 89 +/- 19, Trial 2: 171 +/- 23, Trial 3: 210 +/- 22 sec, p < 0.0001). The time spent in BC on successive trials increased for most rats (33/44), decreased for some (2/44), showed min to no change (5/44) or erratic response (4/44) for others. In conclusion wide variation in the AR in outbred rats could be exploited to study genetic and neurochemical mechanisms of anxiety.", 
    "24": "Male Wistar rats were maintained on a nutritionally adequate diet and diazepam was administered in a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Control animals were pair-fed an adequate diet. Feeding was continued for 180 days, and the effects on the liver, plasma and erythrocyte phospholipid content were studied. It was found that the contents of sphingophospholipids and phosphatidylinositol + phosphatidylserine were significantly reduced in the erythrocytes of diazepam-treated rats. There was a significantly increased content of phosphatidylcholine in the liver an erythrocytes after 180 days of diazepam treatment. Such treatment did not cause statistically significant changes in the plasma of diazepam-treated rats. These investigations are in agreement with the hypothesis that extended or chronic use of drugs such as diazepam may alter membrane-dependent processes.",

DZ was administered in intravenous and intraduodenal boluses, and in intravenous infusion in three groups of rats with different total lipid (TL) content in the central lymph. The effect of a) different lipophilicity of DZ and DDZ, b) lymphatic TL content, and c) route of DZ administration on FL was determined. It was found that a) FL values of DZ exceeded the FL values of DDZ and b) FL values of DZ increased with increasing TL content in the lymph (an opposite relation was found in DDZ), and c) the highest FL value of DZ + DDZ sum after intravenous bolus administration was attained contrary to the lowest one after intraduodenal bolus administration.", 
    "26": "The effects of two benzodiazepines (alprazolam and bromazepam) on performance and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in visual search and verbal recognition memory paradigms were tested in a placebo-controlled double-blind paradigm employing 12 young healthy subjects. Both drugs exerted similar effects on performance and electrophysiological measures. Reaction times and hit rates were adversely affected in both paradigms. The ERP pattern in the visual search experiment suggested an impairment in selective attention (reduction of N1 component) and of automatic feature registration (posterior N2 reduction). In the world recognition experiment a dramatic reduction of the N400 component was seen under benzodiazepines. This is interpreted as reflecting an impaired ability to perform context integration processes.", 
    "27": "We studied the effect of alprazolam (APZ) in 12 healthy volunteers on the psychological stress-induced activation of emotion and on the pituitary-adrenal, adrenomedullary and sympathoneuronal systems. After 3 days of placebo or APZ (1 mg/day orally) administration, we examined plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine, norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine, metanephrine, normetanephrine, homovanillic acid, vanillylmandelic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy phenyglycol, urinary levels of cortisol and catecholamines, circulatory responses and state anxiety levels in subjects undergoing psychological stress based on viewing horror, violence, danger and war film clips. Film viewing produced modest rises of state anxiety levels, of plasma NE concentration and of diastolic blood pressure in both the placebo and drug groups. APZ significantly reduced anxiety levels at the beginning of the experimental session and caused a decrease of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter and cortisol concentrations. Our data suggest that APZ reduced anxiety related to the expectation of the event, while the circuitry between structures responsible for anxiety and peripheral sympathoneural function was still found to be partly sensitive to film viewing.", 
    "28": "The authors investigated the presence of a serum activity inhibiting the specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam (which labels the central benzodiazepine receptors) (BBIA) in patients with different psychiatric disorders and analyzed it by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The results showed that the lowest activity was present in healthy controls who were not different from patients with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. On the contrary, the BBIA values of these 3 groups of patients were significantly lower than those found in patients with bipolar disorder in various phases (depressive, mixed or manic), in unipolar depressives and in patients with panic and delusional disorders. The HPLC analysis of the serum extracts revealed the presence of 3 peaks of activity which were differently distributed in the patients and in the healthy controls, peak 3 being totally absent in the last group and mainly represented in bipolar depressives. The GABA ratio values showed that peaks 1 and 2 behave as agonists while peak 3 behaves as an inverse agonist. The mass fragmentography of the different peaks is in progress.",

Sedation was performed in 36.6% of cases. Subsequent endoscopy would be accepted by 79.3% of patients in the same conditions. Acceptance was significantly better with use of sedation and use of propofol.

    "33": "Our objective was to establish the safety and effectiveness of a loading dose of midazolam for postoperative sedation of children recovering from open heart surgery; a prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study was done with subjects randomized to three groups according to loading dose. I = 0.08 mg.kg-1; II = 0.04 mg.kg-1; and III = 0.00 mg.kg-1 (placebo). An open label continuous midazolam infusion protocol followed. Haemodynamic parameters were monitored. The study was discontinued following an adverse event involving the 23rd subject. When data for all 23 subjects were combined, there was a mean decrease of 10% in blood pressure (BP) 30 min after the loading dose (P < 0.001). Heart rate change was less significant. Clinicians identified four hypotensive episodes as temporally associated with the midazolam load, two each in Groups I (0.08 mg.kg-1) and III (placebo). One subject in Group I (the 23rd) became hypotensive within five min of receiving the loading dose, had a difficult clinical course and died four weeks postoperatively. We cannot conclude that the loading dose of midazolam had any systematic haemodynamic effect in our study population. Although the clinical course of the 23rd subject suggests a subset of more susceptible children (those who receive opioid analgesia with midazolam, are volume-restricted, and/or undergo more complex forms of surgical correction), many critical care patients are inherently physiologically unstable, and concluding clinically that blood pressure fluctuation is drug related may be erroneous.", 
    "34": "There is a well-established body of data demonstrating that protein or protein-calorie malnutrition experienced early in life is associated with neuroanatomical, neurochemical, as well as behavioral alterations in both animals and humans. A number of studies has focused on the following question: are the neuroanatomical and/or neurochemical changes produced by early malnutrition responsible for the altered behaviors reported in malnourished animals? A tool that has been used to help answer this question is the administration of drugs with specific actions in the various neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system (CNS). This neuropharmacological approach has produced a considerable amount of data demonstrating that malnourished animals react to drugs differently from controls, suggesting that the altered behavioral expression of these animals could be partly explained by the alterations in the brain function following malnutrition. The present review will provide an overview of the literature investigating the reactivity of malnourished animals to psychoactive drugs acting through GABAergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic, opioid and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems. Altered responsiveness to psychoactive drugs in malnourished animals may be especially relevant to understanding the consequences of malnutrition in human populations.", 
    "35": "Paradoxical sleep in rats, cats and mice is usually preceded and sometimes followed by a short-lasting (a few seconds) electroencephalogram (EEG) stage characterized by high-amplitude spindles in the anterior cortex and low-frequency theta rhythm in the dorsal hippocampus. The former is an index of advanced slow-wave sleep; the latter is an index of limbic activation since it occurs during active waking and paradoxical sleep. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines extend this intermediate stage at the expense of paradoxical sleep while concomitantly barbiturates suppress the pontine reticular activation characteristic of this sleep stage. During the intermediate stage, thalamocortical responsiveness and thalamic transmission level, which are controlled by brain stem activating influences, are the lowest of all sleep-waking stages. The unusual EEG pattern of this stage is otherwise only observed in the acute intercollicular-transected preparation. Therefore, forebrain structures may be functionally briefly disconnected from the brain-stem during this short-lasting stage, which could possibly account for the mental content of a similar sleep period in humans. In spite of strong evidence in favour of this forebrain deafferentiation hypothesis, other data indicate that the IS is in some way linked either to slow-wave sleep or to paradoxical sleep.",

    "40": "The sensitivity of an alcoholic's sensory systems (SS) to alcohol therapy is a good indication of treatment efficacy in this disease. In this study, we compare pharmacotherapy (PHT) and acupuncture therapy (AP) on the sensitivity of visual (VL), acoustic (AC), olfactory (OL) and taste (TS) systems to alcohol irritants (AI). The results showed that PHT changed the threshold sensitivity of SS to AI but did not cause aversion of SS to AI. In acupuncture treatment, results can be divided into four groups: Group 1, no aversion of AC was produced to AI; Group 2, no aversion of TS and OL were produced to AI; Group 3, no aversion of VL to AI; and group 4, no aversion was recorded to AI. Supposedly, one of the sensory systems of the organism is genetically leading in organizing sensory-emotional operation of information, and other SS are subordinates. Therefore, before acupuncture treatment for alcoholism, it is necessary to cause excitation to the ethanol-dependent system (target-system) by means of irritation to the leading sensory system of the patient.", 
    "41": "Among three calcium channel inhibitors, only nicardipine (10-40 mg/kg) significantly inhibited clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol administered at its CD97 (convulsive dose 97%) of 81 mg/kg, subcutaneously. Nimodipine and flunarizine (both up to 80 mg/kg) did not suppress pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic seizures per se. Co-administration of nicardipine (5 mg/kg) resulted in a significant enhancement of the protective potency of either ethosuximide (50 mg/kg) or valproate (100 mg/kg) against clonic seizures in this test. Similar effects were noted in case of combined treatment of nimodipine (20-40 mg/kg) with these antiepileptics. On the contrary, flunarizine (up to 20 mg/kg) did not modify the anticonvulsive action of these antiepileptic drugs. Moreover, none of the studied calcium channel inhibitors influenced the protective activity of clonazepam (0.01 mg/kg). The antiepileptic drugs, administered alone in above doses, were ineffective against pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic convulsions. In case of ethosuximide and valproate, the motor performance in the chimney test was worsened by co-administration of nimodipine (40 mg/kg). We found no pharmacokinetic interactions (at least in relation to the plasma levels of ethosuximide and valproate) that could explain the observed results. Thus, we conclude that a combination of some calcium channel inhibitors and antiepileptic drugs may provide more efficient protection against experimental seizures which may bear a potential clinical significance.", 
    "42": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is useful in diagnosing senile dementia, but to avoid the creation of artifacts the patient should be kept immobile. We studied the effects of pretreatment with flunitrazepam, a sleep inducer of the benzodiazepine class, as a sedative prior to imaging. The subjects consisted of 108 patients with senile dementia admitted to the Dementia Ward of Kyoto Higashiyama Geriatric Hospital. Their ages ranged from 64-95 years (mean, 81) and the mean body weights of the 76 women and 32 men were 36 and 47 kg, respectively. Immediately before undergoing MRI the patients were given a slow intravenous injection of flunitrazepam (2 mg/ml diluted in 19 ml of saline). Immediately before the patients fell asleep, administration was discontinued and the dose was noted: mean 0.008 mg/kg. In all patients sleep induction and sedation were achieved. No adverse reactions such as apnea were observed. The flunitrazepam dose in our study was much lower than that in previous reports on adults. As body weights of the elderly are also lower than those of younger adults, the optimum dose of flunitrazepam for the elderly may be much lower. Intravenous flunitrazepam may be a useful and safe premedication for MRI in elderly patients with dementia. To avoid serious adverse reactions the dose should be minimized by: 1) determining body weight before MRI, 2) administering diluted flunitrazepam, and 3) discontinuing the drug before the patient falls asleep.", 
    "43": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats developed posthypoxic myoclonus following 10-min cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Previous results showed that dysfunction of central GABAergic neurotransmission may contribute to the disease. In current studies, effects of GABA uptake inhibitors, guvacine hydrochloride (1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridine carboxylic acid hydrochloride) and (+/-)-cis-4-hydroxynipecotic acid ([+/-]-cis-4-hydroxy-3-piperidine carboxylic acid), in the pathophysiology of posthypoxic myoclonus were investigated. Administration of guvacine (1 or 10 mg/kg, IP) or nipecotic acid (0.5 or 5 mg/kg, IP) significantly attenuated myoclonus scores of the animals. Tolerance to antimyoclonus effects of these two compounds did not develop after chronic administration (twice a day for 14 days) of guvacine (10 mg/kg, IP) or nipecotic acid (5 mg/kg, IP). On the other hand, tolerance was noticed with clonazepam (2.5 mg/kg, IP twice a day for 7 days). The results indicate that guvacine or nipecotic acid may be used in combination with (at reduced doses) or as alternatives to clonazepam to treat patients with the disease so as to reduce tolerance phenomenon usually associated with clonazepam.", 
    "44": "One case of prenatally diagnosed congenital diaphragmatic hernia was reviewed in terms of the anesthetic managements. Concentrations of diazepam, pancuronium and fentanyl were measured in maternal, fetal and umbilical serum. As expectedly, the transition of diazepam through the placenta was large and the concentration of diazepam in the fetal serum was equal to that of maternal serum, but only a small amount of pancuronium was transferred.", 
    "45": "The effects of some psychotropic agents were evaluated on cognitive function in rats. Acute administration of antipsychotic agents chlorpromazine, haloperidol or pimozide-all inhibited the active avoidance response as elicited by pole climbing test-the least effect being seen with pimozide. The antianxiety benzodiazepines, lorazepam and alprazolam, also attenuated active avoidance learning with the latter showing lesser effects. Maze task performance was differentially affected by these psychotropic drugs with maze traversing time being increased significantly after all drug treatment, except alprazolam.", 
    "46": "The aim of this study was to describe the use of psychotropic drugs in a psychogeriatric nursing home, \"Joachim en Anna\", in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. To this end the medical records of 890 nursing home patients with dementia, admitted between 1980 and 1989, were analysed retrospectively. Each time pattern of psychotropic drug use was registered. Drugs were coded by means of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. The daily dose was expressed as the ratio of the mean prescribed daily dose and the defined daily dose. Side-effects and changes in prescription patterns throughout the years patients were admitted were analysed. A total of 3,090 time patterns of exposure to psychotropics were registered. Neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants accounted for 58, 32, and 9 percent of the time patterns, respectively. For almost every drug prescription the prescribed daily dose was lower than the defined daily dose. More than 75 percent of these nursing home patients had at least one prescription for a psychotropic drug during institutionalization. One or more side-effects were observed in 50 percent of the patients who used a neuroleptic. The total number of patients receiving psychotropics did not change throughout the study. Psychotropics were prescribed for long-term use, but in a low dose. Side-effects were frequently observed while the correct individual dose was being determined.",

Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep is a complex behavioral state characterized by desynchronized electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, postural atonia, rapid, saccadic movements of the eyes, and vivid dreaming. 2. A recently developed class of drugs, the inverse agonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylates, elicits a number of effects similar to the properties of REM sleep, such as desynchronized cortical EEG and penile erections. 3. The hypothesis is put forth that an endogenous beta-carboline-3-carboxylate exists which may initiate many aspects of REM sleep. 4. Clinical relevance of this hypothesis is discussed with regard to REM anxiety dreams, night terrors, narcolepsy, and depression.",

The effects of Mid were measured by psychomotor tests and by self-rating on visual analogue scales before and 30 and 90 min after intake. Study II was similar, but the post-treatment tests were at 45 and 90 min, and the active drugs used were 0.250 mg Trz, GraTrz, and Mid 10 mg. In the crossover Study III, 6 subjects took Mid 10 mg alone and with Gra (GraMid) and 750 mg erythromycin (EryMid). Performance tests were made and blood was sampled before and 30, 60 and 90 min after intake. Midazolam and its active metabolite alpha-OH-midazolam were assayed by gas chromatography (GC) and radioreceptor assay (RRA).",

GraMid had more effect (P < 0.05) than Mid on the DSS performance. Mid caused drowsiness at 30 and 90 min. Both Mid and GraMid caused clumsiness and a feeling of impaired performance at 90 min. In Study II, the active drugs impaired objective test performances (DSS, LC, CFF) at 90 min, without having a clear subjective effect. In Study III, Mid, EryMid and GraMid impaired performance in the DSS, LC and CFF tests. EryMid proved stronger than Mid and GraMid on DSS and LC tests at 30 min. Mean values of plasma midazolam (and alpha-OH-midazolam) at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after Mid 10 mg were 68(19), 61(19), 43(14) and 42(12) micrograms.l-1.

Further research is needed on the impact of pharmacological treatments on the medium- and long-term course of the disorder.",

This article will review the evidence of the efficacy of single classes of pharmacological agents (antidepressants, including TCAs, MAOIs, and SSRIs; benzodiazepines; and other agents) and integrated treatments, involving coadministration of medications within or across classes or a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Research pertaining to the relative efficacy of administering combination treatments concurrently or sequentially is examined.

    "55": "A chronobiotic is defined and levels of action within the mammalian circadian pacemaker system, such as the retina, retinohypothalamic tract, geniculohypothalamic tract, suprachiasmatic nuclei, output and feedback systems are identified. Classes of drug that include the indoleamines, cholinergic agents, peptides, and benzodiazepines, which might act as chronobiotics within these levels, are evaluated. Particular emphasis is placed on the indole, melatonin (MLT). The clinical circumstances for use of chronobiotics in sleep disturbances of the circadian kind, such as jet lag, shift work, delayed sleep-phase syndrome, advanced sleep-phase syndrome, irregular and non-24-hr sleep-wake cycles, are described under reorganized headings of disorders of entrainment, partial entrainment, and desynchronization. Specific attention is given to the blind and the aged. Both human and animal studies suggest that MLT has powerful chronobiotic properties. MLT shows considerable promise as a prophylactic and therapeutic alternative or supplement to the use of natural and artificial bright light for resetting the circadian pacemaker. Throughout this discussion, the hypnotic and hypothermic versus the chronobiotic actions of MLT are raised. Finally, problems in the design of delivery systems for MLT are discussed.", 
    "56": "Enantiomeric and racemic oxazepam (OX), 3-O-methyloxazepam (MeOX), and 3-O-ethyloxazepam (EtOX) were used to study racemization, heteronucleophilic, and homonucleophilic substitution reactions in anhydrous acidic methanol and ethanol. Kinetics of racemization and nucleophilic substitution reactions in nondeuterated and deuterated solvents were determined by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, chiral stationary phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), reversed-phase HPLC, and mass spectrometry. Several reactions occurred when (S)-OX, for example, was dissolved in acidic methanol: (1) (S)-OX itself underwent spontaneous racemization, (2) the 3-hydroxyl group of (S)-OX was stereoselectively substituted by the methoxy group of methanol to form MeOX enriched in (S)-MeOX, and (3) the 3-methoxy group of (R)-MeOX was stereoselectively substituted by the methoxy group of methanol to form MeOX enriched in (S)-MeOX, and (4) the 3-methoxy group of (R)-MeOX was stereoselectively substituted by the methoxy group of methanol to form MeOX enriched in (R)-MeOX. Repetitive reactions 3 and 4 eventually resulted in a racemic MeOX. Similar reactions occurred for an enantiomeric OX in acidic ethanol.",

    "61": "This review compares the ability of acute and chronic benzodiazepine treatments (BZs), gonadal hormone treatments, and neurosteroids to modify gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) physiologic responses in animals. Both BZ ligands and certain \"neurosteroid\" derivatives of steroid hormones can modulate GABA responses through direct interactions with the GABA receptor complex. Fluctuations in gonadal steroids can be anticonvulsant or proconvulsant, anxiolytic or anesthetic, suggesting a pharmacologic profile comparable to that of the BZs. A comparison of neuronal physiological responses in spinal cord, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus-preoptic area, cerebellum, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, and cortex indicates that both acute and chronic BZ treatments produce region-specific effects on in vivo GABAergic responses. This appears to be based on regional variability in intrinsic sensitivity to GABA and/or BZ ligands, the level of ongoing GABA neurotransmission in a region, and the indirect influences of BZs on afferent inputs to an area. Regionally specific adaptations to chronic BZ treatments that lead to the development of tolerance include the following: intrinsic subsensitivity to GABA, reduced activity in GABAergic circuits (e.g., reduced recurrent inhibition in hippocampus), attenuated responses to BZs without alterations in GABA sensitivity, modulation of the intrinsic properties of neurons, and alterations in the activity of non-GABAergic afferent inputs. The in vivo evidence that neurosteroid derivatives modify physiological responses to GABA is also beginning to emerge. Progesterone, through conversion to its neurosteroid metabolite 3 alpha-OH DHP, potentiates GABA responses of cerebellar Purkinje cells. This neurosteroid also enhances GABA responses in hippocampal slices, including recurrent inhibition, in a BZ-like manner. Despite the evidence that fluctuations in estrogen levels can modulate several aspects of GABA neurotransmission, neither in vivo estrogen treatments nor in vitro administration of estrogen to brain slices clearly modifies physiological GABA responses. Although estrogens alter excitability in several areas, these changes are associated with estrogenic effects on responses to excitatory neurotransmitters or inputs. Relatively few studies have examined the in vivo influences of androgenic steroids on GABA responses.", 
    "62": "Previous work demonstrated that systemic administration of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) partial inverse agonist beta-carboline FG 7142 (FG) augments the cardiovascular response to non-signal stimuli, similar to the effects of an aversive context. Analysis of the parasympathetic and sympathetic contributions to the effects of FG prompted the hypothesis that increases in central cholinergic activity mediates the potentiation of the cardioacceleratory response by FG. Consistent with this hypothesis, the present experiments demonstrate: (a) intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol mimics the response-potentiating effects of FG; (b) this effect of carbachol was blocked by ICV co-administration of the muscarinic antagonist atropine; (c) ICV infusions of atropine blocked the potentiation of the cardioacceleratory response by systemically administered FG, but did not alter the basal response to the stimulus; and (d) 192 IgG-saporin-induced lesions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons prevented the FG-induced potentiation of the cardioacceleratory response, again without altering the basal cardiac response. These data strongly support the hypothesis that the effects of FG on cardiac reactivity are mediated via an activation of central muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "63": "This study explored whether the behavioral heterogeneity of benzodiazepine receptor (BDZR) ligands is a consequence of multiple receptor subtypes or partial agonism. Putative partial agonists Ro16-6028, Ro23-1590, Ro23-0364, and abecarnil were compared with U78875, a mixed agonist-antagonist, and CGS8216, an inverse agonist, in five BDZR-mediated functions: hyperphagia, anxiolysis, sedation, hypothermia, and anticonvulsant activity. Only abecarnil was an agonist in all end points. Each of the other drugs exhibited qualitatively different responses at these end points. Specifically, Ro23-0364 produced no effect on body temperature, but was an agonist at other tests. Ro23-1590 had no effect on anxiolysis and hypothermia, but was an agonist at other tests. In contrast to other putative partial agonists, Ro16-6028 was found to be an antagonist in sedation and U78875 was an antagonist in hypothermia, but both were agonists at other end points. These qualitative differences in activity in the five behavioral end points studied cannot be explained by partial agonism at a single receptor and indicate that these ligands differentially activate multiple BDZR subtypes.", 
    "64": "To investigate the influence of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT pathways on different types of fear, we microinjected into the rat DRN the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 and the excitatory amino acid kainic a acid. In addition, we systemically administered the 5-HT releasing drug D-fenfluramine. The behavioral effects of these drugs were measured in an elevated T-maze, consisting of three arms of equal dimensions (50 x 10 cm), elevated 50 cm from the floor. One arm is enclosed by walls (40 cm) and stands perpendicular to the two open arms. Inhibitory (passive) avoidance--representing learned fear--was measured by placing a rat at the end of the enclosed arm and recording the time to withdraw from this arm with the four paws during three consecutive trials. Soon afterwards, the same animal was placed at the end of one of the open arms and the time to withdraw from this arm with the four paws was recorded. This one-way escape response represents unconditioned fear. Intra-DRN FG 7142 (40 pmol) facilitated inhibitory avoidance (anxiogenic effect), but did not affect one-way escape. Kainic acid (60 pmol) also facilitated inhibitory avoidance and, in addition, impaired one-way escape (anxiolytic effect). These effects are unlikely to be due to motor deficit, because intra-DRN kainate did not change locomotor activity and rearing behavior of rats placed inside a circular arena for 10 min. Finally, D-fenfluramine (0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg, IP) tended to enhance inhibitory avoidance while depressing one-way escape in a dose-dependent way. Because the three drug treatments are believed to increase 5-HT release from DRN nerve terminals, these results support the hypothesis that ascending DRN 5-HT pathways facilitate learned fear while inhibiting unconditioned fear. The former may be related to generalized anxiety and the latter to panic disorder.", 
    "65": "The effects of chlorpromazine and diazepam on performance of two operant tasks, one modelling time estimation and the other motivation to work for food reinforcers, were investigated in rats. These same tasks had been used previously in rhesus monkeys to assess the effects of chlorpromazine and diazepam. Rat performance of the time estimation task [temporal response differentiation (TRD)] was nearly identical to that previously described in monkeys. This performance similarity across these two species occurred despite slightly different methodologies. Performance of the motivation task [progressive ratio (PR)] was clearly different between rats and adult monkeys in that rats exhibited lower values on all PR endpoints. Acute administration of chlorpromazine [0.03-5.6 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (IP)] caused decrements in rat TRD and PR performance at doses > or = 1.0 mg/kg. Acute administration of diazepam (0.25-4.0 mg/kg, IP) altered TRD performance only. The effects of chlorpromazine and diazepam in rats were similar to those previously noted in the monkey, indicating the potential utility of rat performance in these operant tasks to predict drug effects in the rhesus monkey.", 
    "66": "This study examined whether the pharmacologic manipulation of catecholaminergic systems would affect the hypnotic action of flunitrazepam in rats. Flunitrazepam, a potent hypnotic, was used alone or in combination with alpha-methyl paratyrosine (alpha MPT), an inhibitor of the synthesis of catecholamines, and clonidine (CLN), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. Flunitrazepam significantly increased the amount of slow-wave sleep and the latency of paradoxical sleep (PS) and decreased the amount of PS. Administration of flunitrazepam to alpha MPT-treated rats significantly increased the number of sleep cycles and PS episodes as compared with flunitrazepam alone. Clonidine decreased total sleep time and significantly decreased PS. The association of flunitrazepam with CLN induced a decrease in PS and waking as compared with flunitrazepam alone. The possible involvement of noradrenergic mechanisms in modulating the effect of flunitrazepam on the rat sleep-waking cycle is proposed.", 
    "67": "This article reviews the literature on the plasma concentration-effect relationships for benzodiazepines, in humans and in experimental animals. Only literature that explicitly links pharmacokinetics to pharmacodynamics is included. The following questions are evaluated. Can concentration-effect relationships be demonstrated? If so, are these relations stable? Are the influences of specific factors such as age and disease on these relationships established? It is clear that, when studies are conducted and interpreted appropriately, relations can be found for a wide range of benzodiazepine effects. These include objective measures such as electroencephalography, semisubjective measures such as psychomotor performance, and subjective measures such as mood/sedation scales. A generally applicable model of the relationship which will allow prediction of effect is, however, not yet established. The relationship appears to be dependent on route and rate of administration, because of factors such as distributional delay, formation of active metabolites and, probably, acute tolerance. Furthermore, intra- and interindividual variability is considerable, probably due to varying experimental conditions and intrinsic interindividual differences. The limited data available on factors influencing the plasma concentration-effect relationships for benzodiazepines demonstrate clear changes in the pharmacodynamics after multiple doses, suggesting the development of tolerance, and a subsensitivity in patients with panic disorder. The influence of factors such as age, disease and drug interactions on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship remains less clear.", 
    "68": "The effects of single (1mg/kg) and repeated (1mg/kg 2* daily for 4 days) diazepam administration are investigated on brain regional 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration in rats. Daily treatment decreased food intakes but body weights did not decrease. Administration of diazepam (1mg/kg) to 4 day saline injected rats on the 5th day decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and increased it in the hypothalamus. 5-HIAA levels were increased in the striatum and decreased in the hypothalamus 4 day diazepam injected rats injected with saline on the 5th day also exhibited similar changes of 5-HT and 5-HIAA. Cortical levels of 5-HIAA were also smaller in these rats. Administration of diazepam to 4 day diazepam injected rats again decreased 5-HT in the hippocampus and 5-HIAA in the hypothalamus. 5-HT and 5-HIAA were both decreased in the striatum. Regionally specific effects of diazepam on brain serotonin metabolism are discussed in relation to their possible functions.", 
    "69": "It has recently been demonstrated that L-365,260, a CCK-B antagonist in mammals, causes an increase in food intake in chickens. In contrast, L-364, 718, a CCK-A antagonist in mammals, shows this effect only at very high dose levels. It has been shown that L-365,260 has very low affinity for chicken CCK receptors. Thus, the mechanism of action of L-365,260 remains unknown. As L-365,260 is a benzodiazepine derivative, one may hypothesize that it would be acting on benzodiazepine binding sites. The aims of this work were to establish the existence of benzodiazepine binding sites in the chicken brain, and to check the possibility that L-365,260 was acting on these receptors, determining the affinity of L-364,718 and L-365,260 for them. We have found specific binding for tritiated flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine agonist) ([3H]-flunitrazepam) in chicken brain membranes. A single binding site was detected with a Kd of 3.58 +/- 0.97 nM and a Bmax of 451.6 +/- 23.3 fmol/mg protein L-365,260 and L-364,718 exhibited very low affinity for these binding sites (Ki = 1.17 x 10(-6) +/- 0.16 x 10(-6) M and Ki > 10(-5) M, respectively). Thus, these results demonstrate that the increase in food intake caused by L-365,260 in the chicken is not due to a direct action on benzodiazepine receptors. Other possible explanations for its effect are discussed.", 
    "70": "Aging is a physiological process that shares many behavioral, biochemical and neuroendocrine phenomena with the pathophysiological situation of unresolved stress, as well as with a pharmacologically induced syndrome resulting from chronic benzodiazepine (BZ) consumption. Behavioral findings include symptoms such as drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, confusion, weakness, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, reversible dementia, depression, impairment of intellectual, psychomotor and sexual function, agitation, auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoid ideation, panic, delirium, depersonalization, sleepwalking, aggressivity, orthostatic hypotension, and insomnia. Neuroendocrine findings include: central depletion of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine, adrenaline (AD), and serotonin (5-HT); reduction in the ratio of circulating NA/AD as well as platelet 5-HT and increase of AD, plasma free 5-HT and cortisol. These disturbances together with the increased platelet aggregability observed in the three groups are typical of unresolved-stress situations. Immunological findings include significant reduction of peripheral T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) and the CD4/CD8 ratio, CD16 and gamma-delta cells. On the other hand, the three groups (elderly subjects, subjects faced with unresolved stress, and BZ consumers) show increase of the CD57 lymphocyte subset as well as natural killer cytotoxicity. Alterations of several biological markers have also been found, specifically in the oral glucose tolerance test, the intramuscular clonidine test, and the supine/orthostasis/exercise test. From a clinical point of view, the three groups appear to be more susceptible to the appearance and progression of many acute and chronic diseases (infectious and malignant diseases). As a result, chronic consumption of BZs should be avoided in both the elderly and subjects in unresolved-stress situations.", 
    "71": "Recently, anatomical evidence was presented that the mammalian circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) may utilize GABA to transmit diurnal information to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). The present study provides further physiological evidence for the involvement of this GABAergic projection in the regulation of diurnal rhythms. Infusion of the GABA agonist muscimol in the region of the DMH completely blocked the daily increase of plasma melatonin during darkness and reduced sympathetic output in the pineal gland resulting in lower pineal melatonin production, as measured with transpineal microdialysis. Further experiments in SCN-lesioned animals indicated that the origin of this inhibitory input to the DMH is indeed the SCN. The results of this study imply that the SCN can influence the sympathetic outflow of the hypothalamus through its GABA-containing projection. Furthermore, the present results probably explain the previously reported strong inhibitory effect of benzodiazepines on plasma melatonin in both animals and humans.", 
    "72": "We report a five-month-old infant with an impaired left ventricular ejection fraction as a result of Bland-White-Garland-syndrome (BWGS). Total intravenous anaesthesia with fentanyl and midazolam was used as the anaesthetic technique. After aortic reimplantation of the left coronary artery, weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was prolonged and was only successfully managed with high dose noradrenaline, dopamine and dobutamine. Persistent myocardial dysfunction led to prolonged intensive care treatment. Seven months after surgery, left ventricular function and clinical condition have improved significantly.", 
    "73": "The purpose of this observational study was to determine whether hypercarbia or oxygen desaturation occurred during our current regimens of deep sedation or general anaesthesia of infants and children undergoing cardiac catheterization. Data were gathered prospectively from 50 consecutive infants and children aged 4 months to 12 years undergoing cardiac catheterization. Several anaesthetists used the following regimens, which were not randomized: 1) propofol. 1.5-2.0 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl 1 microgram.kg-1 IV over 2 min for induction, followed by propofol infusion of 100-150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; 2) fentanyl 2-3 micrograms.kg-1 and midazolam 0.1-0.2 mg.kg-1 IV over 10-15 min; 3) ketamine 8 mg.kg-1 IM, or 4) same as regimens 1 or 2, plus pancuronium, intubation and controlled ventilation. Regimens 1, 2, and 3 were associated with spontaneous ventilation through the natural airway. End-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), SpO2, and respiratory rate were monitored for 60 min. The three regimens employing spontaneous ventilation through the natural airway were associated with both statistically and clinically significant increases in PetCO2 and decreases in SpO2. This raises the possibility that acute exacerbation of PAP and PVR may occur in pulmonary hypertensive patients. In contrast, PetCO2 and SpO2 did not change significantly from baseline in the controlled ventilation group.", 
    "74": "The National Toxicology Program (NTP) recently determined that the commonly prescribed sedative hypnotic agent oxazepam is a mouse liver carcinogen. Many other benzodiazepines are metabolized to oxazepam resulting in further human exposure to this drug. This has resulted in considerable interest in the mechanism of oxazepam-mediated mouse liver carcinogenesis for use in human risk assessment. Several directions for mechanistic research were examined in this study. B6C3F1 mice were treated with oxazepam-dosed feed at 125 (noncarcinogenic) and 2500 ppm (carcinogenic) for 3, 7, 10, and 21 days. Cell proliferation in liver, cytochrome P450 induction, free radical formation, GSH depletion, and levels of circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were analyzed at these time points. Increased levels of hepatic cell proliferation were observed by 7 days at 125 ppm and by 10 days at 2500 ppm. Microsomal enzyme induction also occurred and was associated with elevated plasma TSH levels. Hepatic GSH levels were slightly depressed but there was no evidence of increased oxidative stress. A similar pattern of biochemical events has been observed to occur during dosed feed treatment with phenobarbital. These results suggest that oxazepam and phenobarbital may induce carcinogenesis by similar mechanisms in mice.",

The possible interaction between itraconazole and diazepam was investigated in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Ten healthy volunteers were given orally placebo or itraconazole 200 mg a day for 4 days. The challenge dose of 5 mg of diazepam was ingested on the fourth day, after which plasma samples were collected and psychomotor performance tests were carried out for 42 h. Despite a statistically significant small increase in the area under the plasma diazepam concentration-time curve and the elimination half-life of diazepam, there was no clinically significant interaction as determined by the psychomotor performance tests. The lack of significant first-pass metabolism and the different metabolic pathways of diazepam explain the smaller interaction potential of diazepam compared with midazolam and triazolam. Diazepam, unlike midazolam and triazolam, can be prescribed in usual doses for patients receiving itraconazole and probably other inhibitors of P4503A4, at least when diazepam is used as single doses.", 
    "76": "The aims of the present study were to compare nocturnal growth hormone (GH) secretion, insulin requirements and insulin sensitivity on two occasions in six adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes when the GH secretion was reduced one night by an oral dose of 100 mg of pirenzepine at bedtime. The mean nocturnal intravenous insulin infusion required to maintain a normal constant blood glucose concentration between 24:00 and 07:00 was 53% higher during the night on placebo (p = 0.0212). During the night on pirenzepine, the serum GH area under the curve (AUC) was reduced in all patients to a mean concentration which was 50.1% (15-78%) of that during the night without pirenzepine (p = 0.0036). The nocturnal urinary GH excretion was also reduced in all of the investigated patients (p = 0.0229). Insulin sensitivity in the morning, measured by the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp, increased significantly from 115 +/- 51 mg m-2 min-1 after the night on placebo to 205 +/- 67 mg m-2 min-1 after the night on pirenzepine (p = 0.0161). No side-effects were observed during the pirenzepine night. Negative correlations were found between the nocturnal serum GH AUC and the insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (r = -0.65, p = 0.0241) and between the nocturnal urinary GH excretion and the insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (r = -0.77, p = 0.0054). In conclusion, the present study shows a relation between GH secretion and insulin resistance in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes. The administration of pirenzepine acutely reduces GH secretion and improves insulin sensitivity.", 
    "77": "In sublingual mucous acini, membrane depolarization induces a threefold transient increase in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration [(Ca(2+))i]. The underlying mechanism was examined by using the Ca(2+) sensitive fluorescent indicator fura-2. Membrane depolarization with high K+ induced a transient [Ca(2+)]i increase in acini, but not in single acinar cells. Atropine, pirenzepine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide prevented the[Ca(2)+]i increase, suggesting the involvement of muscarinic receptor activation. Inhibition of the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca(2+) release pathway with S-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate prevented the depolarization-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]i. Blockade of nicotinic receptors and L-, N-, and P-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (hexamethonium, nifedipine, diltiazem, (omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-agatoxin IVA) did not inhibit the increase in [Ca(2+)]i. However, Cd(2)+ (0.2 mM) blocked >85 percent of the [Ca2+]i increase. The depolarization-induced [Ca(2+)]i increase was also extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent. These results suggest that the membrane depolarization-induced Ca(2+) increase in sublingual acini is mediated by activating Cd(2+)-sensitive, voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels in nerve terminals associated with the dispersed acini and stimulating release of acetylcholine, which then triggers the [Ca(2+)]i increase in acinar cells.", 
    "78": "Forty-nine children having day-stay surgical procedures were randomly assigned to receive oral midazolam 0.75 mg.kg-1 or placebo in a double blind fashion. The child's level of anxiety was assessed before premedication using parental, child and observer scales. The child and observer anxiety scores were repeated in the anaesthetic room. Most children presented for anaesthesia in a calm state, irrespective of whether they had received midazolam. Parents tended to overestimate their child's level of anxiety. Observer anxiety scores reliably predicted behaviour during induction of anaesthesia in the absence of a sedative. Observer scores decreased in the midazolam group (P < 0.02), but not in the placebo group, children below six years having the greatest decrease with midazolam. The median time to discharge from hospital was delayed by 30 min in the midazolam group (P < 0.01). Children do not require routine sedative premedication for day case procedures, but oral midazolam is useful in producing calm behaviour in those children with high observer anxiety scores.", 
    "79": "1. Neurosteroids such as pregnanolone have been established as potent modulators of the GABAA receptor in both electrophysiological and binding studies. Since cholesterol is present in substantial amounts in the neuronal membranes, we have sought evidence for possible interactions of cholesterol with the neurosteroid site and more generally, with the GABAA channel. 2. Synaptosomal membranes were prepared from rat whole brain, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and spinal cord. These membranes were enriched with cholesterol to about double the original level by incubation with liposomes comprised of 50 phosphatidylcholine: 50 cholesterol in the presence of 1% BSA. The additional cholesterol formed a homogeneous mixture with the endogenous cholesterol. 3. The effects of cholesterol and modulatory drugs on the GABAA channel were assessed from the changes induced in [3H]-flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding. Cholesterol enrichment did not affect FNZ binding itself; however, the enhancement of [3H]-FNZ binding by pregnanolone was affected. In membranes from cerebral cortex, the potency of pregnanolone was reduced by a factor of 3.2 following cholesterol enrichment. By contrast, in membranes from spinal cord, the potency of pregnanolone was increased by a factor of 8.4 following cholesterol enrichment. In membranes from cerebellum, there was little overall change in pregnanolone potency although the effects of threshold concentrations were increased. 4. The enhancement of [3H]-FNZ binding by propofol in whole brain membranes was reduced in cholesterol-enriched membranes, similar to the effects of pregnanolone. Experiments with muscimol resulted in an increase in its potency as a potentiator of [3H]-FNZ binding, following cholesterol enrichment. 5. These results provide little evidence for a selective competition between cholesterol and pregnanolone at its binding site. Rather, they suggest an influence of membrane cholesterol on the functional coupling between the benzodiazepine site and the other specific drug sites on the GABAA channel. The detailed pattern of influence depended upon the region of CNS and may be related to the subunit composition of the GABAA channels present.", 
    "80": "A threefold higher area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of nifedipine, a substrate of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A), has been shown in Southern Asians when compared with Caucasians. To determine if these differences are specific to nifedipine or apply to other substrates of CYP3A, we examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 0.375 mg triazolam, another substrate of CYP3A, in eight healthy Caucasians and eight healthy Southern Asians in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. When compared with Caucasians, Southern Asians achieved higher maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (8.0 +/- 2.6 vs 4.8 +/- 1.9 ng ml-1; the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean difference was 0.76 to 5.7; P < 0.01) and had a shorter time to reach maximal concentration (tmax) (45 min (range 30-75) vs 90 min (range 60-145); the 95% CI of the mean difference was -69 to -20; P < 0.002). Triazolam AUC, clearance and partial metabolic clearance did not differ significantly between Southern Asians and Caucasians. Significant differences were found in postural sway after triazolam when compared with placebo in both Caucasians (double stance: eyes open (DSEO): 172.9 +/- 82.9 vs 1138.9 +/- 1182.4; the 95% CI of the mean difference was -1897.2 to -34.4; P < 0.04; and Southern Asians (DSEO: 216.2 +/- 80.9 vs 1086.0 +/- 827.1; the 95% CI of the mean difference was -1564.2 to -175.6; P = 0.02; double stance: eyes closed (DSEC): 207.5 +/- 89.8 vs 1156.9 +/- 932.1; the 95% CI of the mean difference was -1718.5 to -178.5; P = 0.02; with no significant difference between the two ethnic groups. These results suggest that the large inter-ethnic difference in nifedipine clearance are not generalizable to all CYP3A4 substrates.", 
    "81": "Developments over the past 20 years in maintenance treatment have substantially reduced problems with relapses, rehospitalization, and serious psychopathology and dysfunction for most patients with schizophrenia. Therapeutic gains can be accomplished with minimal dosing strategies, targeted drug therapy for medication-refusing patients, psychosocial interventions, and new drugs. Although minimal dose maintenance requires close clinical monitoring and effective collaboration, this strategy reduces side effects and negative symptoms and may thereby translate into greater medication compliance. Psychosocial therapeutics that include family intervention in conjunction with antipsychotic drug treatment reduce relapse rates, but further study is needed. Lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, and antidepressant drugs along with electroconvulsive therapy and social skills training provide other relevant approaches in maintenance treatment. Before a maintenance role for new drugs such as clozapine and risperidone is clarified, controlled studies are needed. However, the advantages with motor side effects and secondary negative symptoms should enhance clinical course and medication compliance, and superior antipsychotic prophylaxis is hypothesized. Special issues in maintenance treatment include difficulty in predicting relapse, increased risk of adverse drug effects in elderly patients, and complication of the nonpsychotic aspects of schizophrenia by continued use of antipsychotic drugs. Optimal maintenance treatment incorporates early detection and outpatient management of symptom exacerbation, minimal dosing to increase compliance and reduce adverse effects, psychosocial intervention to reduce relapse rates and enhance functioning, and the integration of several therapeutic modalities and the provision of case managers and assertive community treatment teams.", 
    "82": "In this article, we review the use of stably transfected cells to study the regulation of receptor structure and function by chronic drug treatments and compare results from these cells to results obtained from other systems, including neuronal cultures and intact animals. We focus on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex. Sedative/hypnotic drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol that potentiate GABAA receptor function produce tolerance and dependence. Chronic treatment of GABAA receptor preparations from brain and neuronal cultures with GABAA agonists, as well as these other three classes of drugs, results in regulation of several properties of the receptor. Drug treatments may regulate levels of binding sites, allosteric binding interactions, receptor function, levels of receptor subunit mRNA and levels of receptor subunit protein. Some or all of these effects may comprise the molecular mechanisms of tolerance to these GABAA-modulatory drugs. The use of cells stably transfected with neurotransmitter receptors provides a homogeneous population that can be cultured under controlled conditions. As most preparations contain mixed populations of GABAA receptor subunits, stably transfected cells offer the advantage of the expression of receptors with a defined subunit composition. We conclude that chronic drug treatments regulate allosteric coupling and function of GABAA receptors in stably transfected cells. This regulation does not appear to be due to decreases in the expression of alpha 1- or beta 1-receptor subunits or to expression of subunits other than alpha 1, beta 1, gamma 2L. Therefore, it is unlikely to be due to changes in receptor subunit composition and probably represents post-translational changes. The rapid regulation of allosteric coupling and function by drug treatment of the stably transfected cells should provide insights to the mechanisms of coupling between GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors as well as tolerance and dependence of benzodiazepines and ethanol.", 
    "83": "The effect of daily forced swimming (15 min) of rats for 21 consecutive days on peripheral-type bentodiazepine receptors (PBR) was investigated. A significant reduction (-17%; p < 0.05) was observed in renal PBR in the stressed animals. A nonsignificant reduction of -18% was detected in adrenal PBR. The maximal binding capacity of [3H]PK 11195 was unaltered in the liver, heart, testis and thymus. It seems that the kidney is especially sensitive to repeated stress. The renal PBR reduction may be related to habituation to stress, and may reflect an adaptatory mechanism aimed at preventing long-term stress-induced overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "84": "This study was designed to investigate benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Imaging of BZR and measurement of CBF were performed by SPECT using 123I-Iomazenil (IMZ) and 123I-IMP respectively, in seven patients with early Alzheimer's disease and five patients with unilateral left cerebral infarction as controls. The values for the normal cerebral hemisphere (ratio to the contralateral cerebellum) in patients with cerebral infarction were adopted as control values. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, the CBF (ratio to cerebellum) decreased significantly in the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex compared with the control values. There was no significant difference in late IMZ SPECT counts (ratio to cerebellum) and washout (the ratio of late-to-early IMZ SPECT counts) between patients with Alzheimer's disease and the controls. However, the late IMZ SPECT counts and washout decreased in one patient with moderate dementia. There was a significant correlation between the severity of dementia and the late IMZ SPECT counts in the temporal cortex and the parietal cortex. These results suggest that benzodiazepine binding sites are relatively well preserved in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, and reduction of the CBF is caused by neuronal dysfunction rather than by neuronal loss. IMZ SPECT study is useful and necessary for clarifying the pathophysiological state in Alzheimer's disease.",

This study was performed to quantify the role of substance abuse in fatal fires occurring in New Jersey over a 7-year period. Records of all the fatalities of fire reported to the State Medical Examiners Office between 1985 and 1991 were retrospectively examined. Blood assay results for ethanol were positive in 215 of the 727 (29.5%) fatalities of fire tested. For this group, the mean blood-ethanol level was 193.9 mg/dl. Blood or urine assay results for substances of abuse were positive in 78 of the 534 (14.6%) fatalities tested. The most commonly detected illicit substances were cocaine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and cannabinoids. The test results were positive for both ethanol and drug use in 36 victims. Forty percent of all the fatalities of fire were aged younger than 11 or older than 70. In contradistinction, 75% of drug-positive fatalities of fire and 58% of ethanol-positive fatalities of fire were between the ages of 21 and 50, suggesting that inebriation may impair the ability to escape from fire. Substance abusers in middle life are a previously unrecognized group at higher risk of injury or death in a fire.", 
    "86": "Separation of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate subtypes of glutamate receptors, known as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and kainate receptors, is traced through conventional pharmacology to molecular biology. The physiology and pharmacology of recombinant receptor subtypes (GluR1-7 and KA1-2) are described. Competitive antagonists, e.g., the quinoxalinedione, 2,3-dihyroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benz(F)quinoxaline, and the decahydroisoquinoline, 3S,4aR,6R, 8aR-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazol-5-yl)ethyl]-decahydroisoquinolin e-3-carboxylate, have a broad antagonist spectrum, except that the latter is inactive on GluR6. The 2,3-benzodiazepines noncompetitively antagonise the AMPA receptor GluR1-4. Desensitisation of AMPA (GluR1-4) and kainate (GluR5-7 and KA1-2) receptors is blocked by cyclothiazide and concanavalin A, respectively. Polyamine toxins block AMPA receptors not containing GluR2 and unedited kainate receptors (GluR5-6). These data correlate well with results on native neurons characterised by techniques such as in situ hybridisation.", 
    "87": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) decreases food intake in a variety of species when administered systemically or centrally. Moreover, both CCKA and CCKB receptor mechanisms have been implicated in CCK's effects on feeding. Previous work done in our laboratory has shown that rats exhibit significant individual differences in the consumption of sugar. Moreover, intra-nucleus accumbens (Acc) administration of CCK reduced sugar consumption in rats with high baseline sugar intake (High) but did not affect sugar consumption in rats with low baseline sugar intake (Low). Thus, CCK mechanisms may contribute to individual differences in sugar intake observed in rats. The present study examined the involvement of endogenous CCK mechanisms in the regulation of sugar intake in Low and High rats. In Experiment 1, male Wistar rats were administered either the CCKA antagonist devazepide (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg) or the CCKB antagonist L,365-260 (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 mg/kg) IP, and their intake of sugar and powdered lab chow recorded for 1 h. Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1 with the exception that rats received intra-Acc administrations of the selective CCKB antagonist PD-135158 (3, 10, 30 micrograms). Results showed that blockade of CCKB, but not CCKA receptors produced an increase in sugar consumption in Low rats and a decrease in sugar consumption in High rats. These effects were obtained with both systemic and intra-Acc administrations of a selective CCKB antagonist. These results suggest that endogenous CCK contributes to the mechanism regulating sugar consumption in Low and High rats through its actions on CCKB receptors in the Acc.", 
    "88": "The discovery that non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic agents such as buspirone bind with high affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor has stimulated the development of selective 5-HT1A receptor ligands as potential drug candidates. However, the lack of selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists has hampered the elucidation of the mechanism of action of these agents, indeed, it is still unclear whether buspirone exerts its anxiolytic effects via an agonist action at presynaptic (somatodendritic) or an antagonist action at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Ligands that have been used previously to define the 5-HT1A receptor are either non-selective or have agonist activity at the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor. It is only in the past three years that selective and silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonists have emerged. This overview compares the profiles of the first selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists in models of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor function. In addition, it highlights some of the problems associated with the development of selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists.", 
    "89": "It is known that the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) increases after brain damage. Astrocytes are among the cell types where PBR ligand binding has been detected and may be involved in the response to neuronal injury and regeneration. Consistent with the hypothesis, the apparent density of PBR sites in astrocytes is increased by both cytokines and neurotoxins. However, microglia, the resident macrophages which represent 5-15% of glial cell populations have not been evaluated for the presence of the PBR. In the present study, we report the presence of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding in microglial cells. In particular, we used BV-2 cells, an immortalized cell line of murine microglial cells. High affinity binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to a single site was detected in membranes prepared from BV-2 cells (KD = 4.4 nM, Bmax = 3,800 fmoles/mg protein). Various ligands for the PBR displaced [3H]Ro5-4864 binding with the following rank order of potencies: PK11195 = Ro5-4864 > FGIN-1-27 > triazolam = diazepam > beta-pro-pyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate = clonazepam > lorazepam = flurazepam > chlordiazepoxide = clorazepate. Subcellular fractionationstudies indicate that the majority of the Ro5-4864 binding sites is in the mitochondrial fraction. The remainder is found in nonmitochondrial cell fractions. The [3H]Ro5-4864 binding observed on intact cells had characteristics similar to those found on membranes. The presence of a high density of PBRs in these cells establish the basis for additional investigations into their possible functional role, if any, in the microglial response to neuronal injury.",

The drug shows a subtype selectivity (M1/M2=8; M1/M3=178; M2/M3=22) that proposes it as a useful pharmacological tool for receptor studies. S-(-)-ET 126, like pirenzepine, prevents the antinociception induced by M1 agonists (McN-A-343 and AF-102B). Unlike pirenzepine and spirotramine, the compound is able to cross the blood brain barrier which makes it useful for in vivo investigations.", 
    "92": "To investigate the possible role of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in hepatic encephalopathy, we examined expression of PBR in mouse brain following thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute liver failure. Treatment of mice with TAA resulted in an increase in the number of binding sites of the PBR ligand [3H] Ro5-4864 to brain homogenates, with no significant change in affinity of the ligand. The order of potency of different ligands to compete against [3H] Ro5-4864 binding in the brain of TAA-treated mice was Ro5-4864 > PK11195 > diazepam > protoporphyrin IX, findings similar to those in the control. Northern blot analysis revealed an increase in PBR/isoquinoline binding protein (PBR/IBP) mRNA in mouse brain following TAA treatment, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that the increased number of PBR in the brains of TAA-treated mice relates to the induction of PBR/IBP expression and suggest that the induction of PBR in brain may contribute to pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.",

    "100": "Exocrine pancreatic zymogens are proteolytically processed to active forms after they are secreted into the small intestine. However, intracellular conversion of zymogens to active forms can be stimulated by treating pancreatic acinar cells with high doses of cholecystokinin (0.1 microM) or carbamylcholine (0.1 mM). The high doses of cholecystokinin are unlikely to be achieved physiologically. The ability of ethanol to sensitize the acinar cell to zymogen conversion Induced by cholecystokinin or carbamylcholine was examined. Ethanol (10-200 mM) had no effect alone or when combined with carbamylcholine. However, ethanol (25 mM) added with low-dose cholecystokinin (0.1 nM) generated zymogen conversion that was 1) sixfold higher than cholecystokinin alone and 2) equivalent to that generated by highdose cholecystokinin (10 microM). The ability of ethanol to enhance cholecystokinin-induced zymogen conversion was dependent on the dose of ethanol and the duration of ethanol treatment. The cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-364,718, blocked the conversion stimulated by the addition of ethanol with cholecystokinin. This effect of ethanol did not change the affinity or number of cholecystokinin receptors, suggesting an effect more distal in the stimulus-activation cascade. These findings demonstrate that ethanol selectively sensitizes the pancreatic acinar cell to cholecystokinin-stimulated zymogen proteolysis.", 
    "101": "Carbamate and organophosphate poisoning is a well known toxicological problem in developing countries, but still has, even in industrialized ones, a high mortality rate and a frequent invalidating outcome. Serious problems especially arise from cardiac (toxic myocarditis, QT prolongation, and other ventricular arrhythmias), muscular (intermediate syndrome, OPIDN), and neuro-behavioral (regressive psychosis, cognitive, mnesic and perceptive alterations) sequelae. Such complications, caused by direct neuronal, cardiac, and muscular damage, sneaky appear immediately after resolution of cholinergic crisis. Early establishment of antidotal (atropine + oximes) and supportive therapy, while reducing duration and seriousness of cholinergic crisis, should increase survival rates. In order to improve \"quoad valetudinem\" prognosis, widespread use of benzodiazepines is still recommended: such drugs antagonize some central signs and symptoms of cholinergic attack insensitive to atropine (fasciculations, muscular spasms, seizures, anxiety, psychomotor agitation). Moreover, they attenuate neuronal, cardiac, and muscular damage, caused by cholinergic overstimulation, which is responsible for invalidating outcome.", 
    "102": "We examined the in vitro cytotoxicity, antitumour activity and preclinical pharmacokinetics of the novel sequence-selective, bifunctional alkylating agent DSB-120, a synthetic pyrrolo[1,4][2,1-c]benzodiazepine dimer. DSB-120 was shown to be a potent cytotoxic agent in vitro against a panel of human colon carcinomas [50% growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50) 42 +/- 7.9 nM, mean +/- SE, n = 7] and two rodent tumours (L1210 and ADJ/PC6). Antitumour activity was assessed in the bifunctional alkylating-agent-sensitive murine plasmacytoma ADJ/PC6 using a variety of administration protocols. The maximal antitumour effects were observed following a single i.v. dose but the therapeutic index was only 2.6. DSB-120 was less effective when given i.p. either singly or by a daily x 5 schedule. After a single i.v. dose at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD, 5 mgkg-1) the plasma elimination was biphasic, with a short distribution phase (t1/2 alpha 4 min) being followed by a longer elimination phase (t1/2 beta 38 min). Peak plasma concentrations were 25 micrograms ml-1, the clearance was 1.3 ml g-1 h-1 and the AUC0-infinity was 230 micrograms ml-1 min. Concentrations of DSB-120 in ADJ/PC6 tumours were very low, showing a peak of 0.4 micrograms g-1 at 5 min. The steady-state tumour/plasma ratio was about 5% and the AUC was only 2.5% of that occurring in the plasma. DSB-120 appeared to be unstable in vivo, with only 1% of an administered dose being recovered unchanged in 24-h urine samples. Plasma protein binding was extensive at 96.6%. In conclusion, the poor antitumour activity of DSB-120 may be a consequence of low tumour selectivity and drug uptake as a result of high protein binding and/or extensive drug metabolism in vivo.", 
    "103": "In step-down test, diazepam (1 mg.kg-1 po, 1 h before training) was shown to significantly impair memory acquisition in mice. But piracetam (200 mg.kg-1 ip, 1 h before training) was found to improve the diazepam-induced impairments of learning. By photocell cage method, piracetam showed no significant inhibitory effect on the diazepam-induced spontaneous motor activity in mice. In Y-maze test, Glutamic acid (0.1 microgram, icv, 3 min before training) significantly improved learning in normal mice and the amnesic effect of GABA and diazepam were completely antagonized by Glutamic acid and piracetam (200 mg.kg-1 ip, 1 h before training). These results suggest that increasing GABA-ergic neuronal transmission is unfavorable to learning and memory, but increasing Glu-ergic transmission is contrary to the former.

Since some of the pharmacological effects of ethanol are thought to be mediated via the GABA/benzodiazepine-chloride channel complex, we investigated if extracts from Radix Puerariae contain active substances at the benzodiazepine receptor which could explain its reported usefulness for medical purposes. Therefore, a bioassay-guided purification of active substances from Radix Puerariae was initiated.",

It is not known whether generation of these two EEG frequencies is mediated by the same or different neuronal mechanisms. In this report, we compare alterations of delta, sigma and beta EEG induced by FNZ (4 mg) orally administered to five healthy male subjects for seven consecutive nights. Sleep EEG on the baseline night (BLN), and the fourth and seventh drug nights (4DN, 7DN) was subjected to fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. On drug nights, sigma was enhanced without regard to delta amount, but beta was enhanced only during epochs containing low delta. Thus, sigma and beta EEG were altered differently by the same pharmacological agent. These results suggest that sigma and beta EEG are mediated by different neuronal mechanisms.", 
    "106": "This study was carried out to assess the efficacy of oral lorazepam on postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to two groups, and receiving orally, one hour before induction of anaesthesia, either 2.5 mg of lorazepam (n = 13) or a placebo (n = 13). Lorazepam reduced the incidence and especially the intensity of nausea. The incidence of vomiting in the lorazepam group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (14.5% vs 45%). The use of lorazepam for premedication thus reduces the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The advantages of this benzodiazepine are its ease of use, low cost and very low incidence of side effects.",

    "110": "Twenty-nine French and three non French centers answered the questionnaire. In 14 centers, more than 60 SAH had been treated in the previous year. Angiography was performed under sedation with a benzodiazepine associated with an opioid (54%). Criteria for choosing an endovascular approach were the site of the aneurysm (81%), its neck size (42%) and the underlying disease (42%). Anaesthesia was induced with either propofol (60%) or thiopentone (40%) associated with an opioid and a muscle relaxant. It was maintained with either isoflurane (59%) or propofol (41%). Nitrous oxide was often associated (62%). During anaesthesia, nimodipine (84%), mannitol (69%), anticonvulsants (47%), dopamine (31%) and lidocaine (9%) were also administered. Postoperatively, nimodipine was administered for prophylaxis of vasospasm (97%) and transcranial Doppler was employed to diagnose vasospasm (50%). Other techniques of care included hypervolaemia (89%), controlled arterial hypertension (36%) and haemodilution (36%).", 
    "111": "In anesthetized cats, swallowing elicited by electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerves (SLNs) was inhibited by the GABA-mimetic muscimol and by diazepam, an action that was reversed by picrotoxin and bicuculline. This inhibition supports the involvement of GABA receptors, specifically those of the GABAA subtype which both antagonists have been shown to block in various areas of the central nervous system. The inhibition of reflex swallowing and its reversal were unaltered by a transection of the brainstem at a midcollicular level. Stimulation of the SLNs also caused a bradycardia that was inhibited by both muscimol and diazepam and was restored by both GABA antagonists. Data from these experiments provide suggestive evidence for a role of GABA-ergic transmission in the central control of the deglutitory reflex.", 
    "112": "Infantile spasms and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are considered to be age-specific pediatric epileptic syndromes and together constitute a significant percentage of medically resistant seizures in childhood. Twenty children, ages 4 to 28 months (median, 12 months), with medically refractory infantile spasms or the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, were treated with the investigational benzodiazepine nitrazepam in an open-label study. Daily dosage of nitrazepam ranged from 0.5 to 3.5 mg/kg, with a median dosage of 1.5 mg/kg, divided into two doses per day. Side effects included pooling of oral secretions (12 children) and sedation (six children); however, no serious side effects were seen. Responses to nitrazepam were as follows: five complete responses (cessation of all seizures), seven partial responses (greater than 50% reduction of seizures), and eight with no response. Median duration of response was 9 months (range, 4 to 16 months) in children with infantile spasms and 14 months (range, 8 to 26 months) in children with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Nitrazepam is an effective anticonvulsant in this small cohort of children with medically refractory infantile spasms and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, resulting in a 25% response rate and only modest side effects.", 
    "113": "The SSRI antidepressants have emerged as effective new treatment for patients with premature ejaculation whether or not these patients suffer from depression. Clomipramine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline seem to be a safe treatment option for patients with premature ejaculation, especially in cases of failed psychological treatment, in rejection of psychological treatment, and when partners are unwilling to cooperate in treatment. Further controlled and larger studies that focus on clinically relevant issues such as dose, length of treatment, maintenance of beneficial effects after treatment discontinuation, and the combination of pharmaco- and behavior therapy for premature ejaculation are warranted. Other medications, such as benzodiazepines, may be useful in some cases of premature ejaculation.", 
    "114": "1. Treatment of cultured cerebellar granule cells for 3 min with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) resulted in a concentration-dependent elevation of cyclic GMP. However, neither kainate (KA) nor NMDA produced a concentration-dependent elevation of this nucleotide after exposing cells to the agonist for 60 min. 2. Unlike the case for cGMP, both KA and NMDA produced concentration-dependent elevations of glutamate for 60 min incubation. 3. The NMDA-induced elevations of cGMP and glutamate were blocked by selective NMDA receptor antagonists. 4. The selective KA/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist, 6,7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), blocked the KA-induced elevations of cGMP with 3-min exposures, but it augmented the response with 60-min exposures. However, the KA-induced release of glutamate was prevented by DNQX. 5. The KA/AMPA receptor antagonist, GYKI 52466, blocked all KA-induced responses regardless of the incubation times.", 
    "115": "Previous studies have suggested that in some circumstances, learning processes such as overshadowing may determine the effects that one drug has upon the response to another. The experiments described here examined overshadowing in rats trained to discriminate mixtures of nicotine plus midazolam in two-lever operant procedures with food reinforcement. After training for 60 sessions, midazolam (0.32 mg/kg SC) overshadowed nicotine (0.32 mg/kg SC) so that the discriminative stimulus effect of nicotine seen in control rats trained with nicotine alone was abolished (n = 8-10). In the next phase of the study, the discriminative response to midazolam in one group of mixture-trained rats was devalued by means of an extinction procedure which weakened the relationship between administration of midazolam and the response that was reinforced. Dose-response determinations then showed that the devaluation procedure had indeed attenuated the response to midazolam, whereas the previously overshadowed response to nicotine was restored. Post-session injections of drugs were used to equate the pharmacological histories of the groups and the effects seen were therefore attributable to training with the drugs and not simply to repeated exposure to them. Additionally, in the control rats trained with nicotine only (with midazolam given post-session), midazolam markedly reduced response rates, whereas in the three groups of rats trained with the mixture, midazolam had little response rate-depressant effect; this observation suggests that behaviourally contingent tolerance had developed to the response rate-reducing effect of midazolam. Application of devaluation procedures in studies of the discriminative stimulus effects of single drugs with multiple effects may provide a means for manipulating the characteristics of the discriminations obtained and for identifying individual elements of the drug-produced stimulus complex.", 
    "116": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the preference for buspirone, an anxiolytic predicted to have minimal abuse potential, in comparison with diazepam in moderate drinkers. Preference for diazepam and buspirone was assessed in 55 moderate drinkers using a seven-session procedure consisting of four sampling sessions followed by three choice sessions. On each sampling session subjects ingested five capsules, one every 30 min. Color-coded capsules contained placebo on two sessions and drug on two sessions. Each drug capsule contained diazepam (4 mg) for 30 subjects and buspirone (5 mg) for 25 subjects. On choice sessions subjects chose whichever of the two color-coded capsules, i.e., drug or placebo, they wished to take. After ingesting one capsule, every 30 min they had the option of ingesting another capsule of the same color and content, for a maximum of seven capsules over the session (maximum of 28 mg diazepam or 35 mg buspirone). In the diazepam group 70% of subjects chose diazepam over placebo on at least two of the three choice sessions, whereas in the buspirone group only 24% of subjects chose buspirone over placebo on at least two sessions. Both diazepam and buspirone increased measures of sedation. Only diazepam increased ratings of liking and impaired performance, whereas only buspirone decreased ratings of feeling Friendly. These results replicate previous findings indicating that diazepam has reinforcing effects in moderate drinkers. Further, these results demonstrate the pharmacological specificity of this effect by showing that buspirone did not function as a reinforcer under these same conditions.", 
    "117": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is co-localized with dopamine (DA) in portions of the mesolimbic system, where it may facilitate the function of DA through the CCKA receptor subtype. DA has been implicated in the acquisition of conditioned incentive learning, raising the possibility of a role for endogenous CCK in this learning process. This hypothesis was tested using two complementary behavioral paradigms. Experiment 1 examined the effects of systemic administration of the CCKA receptor selective antagonist, devazepide (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg), on the acquisition of conditioned reward. Two novel levers were presented to drug-free animals in a test session; depression of the conditioned reward (CR) lever produced a light-tone stimulus previously paired with food availability while depression of the non-CR lever produced no programmed consequence. Animals receiving vehicle pretreatment in the food-CS conditioning sessions responded more frequently on the CR lever during the test session. However, pre-treatment with devazepide (0.1 mg/kg but not 0.001 or 0.01 mg/kg) in the conditioning sessions blocked the acquisition of conditioned reward. In contrast, experiment 2 showed that the development of conditioned reward was not affected by similar administration of the CCKB selective antagonist, L-365,260 (0, 0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 mg/kg). The possibilities that devazepide (0.1 mg/kg) impaired the development of conditioned reward by decreasing the amount of food consumed or by inducing a conditioned taste aversion to the food were ruled out in experiments 3 and 4. The effects of devazepide on the acquisition of conditioned activity induced by amphetamine were assessed in experiment 5. During four conditioning sessions, rats received devazepide (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg) treatment prior to amphetamine-environment pairings. The conditioned activity effect was demonstrated if on the subsequent drug-free test day the environment alone elicited increased locomotion. Devazepide (0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the development of conditioned activity. Together, these results provide converging evidence that intact CCKA function may be necessary for the development of conditioned incentive learning.", 
    "118": "Aminophylline reversed the protective action of both, D-3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-1-propenyl-1-phosphonic acid (D-CPP-ene-a competitive NMDA antagonist) and valproate (used as a conventional antiepileptic drug for comparative purposes) against maximal electroshock-induced seizures. The respective ED50 values of aminophylline were 55.7 and 98.4 mg/kg i.p. However, aminophylline (up to 100 mg/kg i.p.) did not influence the protective efficacy of 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methyl- enedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466-a non-NMDA antagonist). Strychnine affected the protection provided by D-CPP-ene, GYKI 52466, and valproate against maximal electroshock-the ED50 values of strychnine for the reversal of the anticonvulsive effects of D-CPP-ene, GYKI 52466 or valproate were 0.082, 0.35 and 0.28 mg/kg s.c., respectively. An involvement of strychnine sensitive glycinergic receptor-mediated events in the mechanism of the anticonvulsive activity of excitatory amino acid antagonists and valproate may be postulated. The ineffectiveness of aminophylline to reduce the anticonvulsive effects of GYKI 52466 may distinguish a new class of antiepileptic drugs offering an advantage over conventional antiepileptics in patients with epilepsy, requiring aminophylline for pulmonary reasons.", 
    "119": "This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and profile of use of benzodiazepines in the Italian population and risk factors for use. Between November 1992 and February 1993, 62 general practitioners submitted a validated self-administered questionnaire on health status and drug use to a randomised sample of 3100 subjects ( > or = 18 years of age, stratified by sex and age), of whom 2803 responded (response, rate 90.4%). Main outcome measures were point estimate (past-week) of all the drugs taken by each individual, dosage and length of use and source of the prescription. The overall past-week prevalence of use of benzodiazepines was 8.6% (5.0% males and 11.8% females). In the elderly ( > or = 65 years) 18.8% reported current use (9.0% males and 24.7% females). Fifty-six per cent of the persons exposed to a benzodiazepine were chronic users (daily, for more than 6 months), and 70.1% in subjects > or = 65 years. The average daily dose taken was relatively low: 61% of short-term users and 51% of chronic users used less than half a defined daily dose (DDD). Female sex, older age, unemployment and retirement were independently associated with the use of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine use in Italy appeared to be relatively high (about 9% of subjects reported current use 57% of whom were chronic users). Women were prescribed a benzodiazepine twice as often as men and one out of four elderly women was on treatment. Although the average dosage used was rather low, the high prevalence and the elevated proportion of chronic users should encourage drug information campaigns and educational interventions to promote a more conservative use of these drugs especially in the elderly.", 
    "120": "In healthy volunteers thermal specific, thermal pain and vibration thresholds were assessed and correlated to each other and to sympathetic nervous system parameters. Additionally, different factors such as temperature, diazepam and ischemia affecting perception thresholds were evaluated. The thresholds assessed did not correlate significantly to each other and to sympathetic skin response latency or amplitude. Diazepam influenced the thermal specific, thermal pain and vibration thresholds assessed. The preingestion and postingestion (after 30, 60 and 90 minutes) thresholds did not differ significantly, meanwhile the scatter of thermal and vibration thresholds increased obviously. The skin temperature within the range of naturally occurring values of control subjects in a state of \"thermal comfort\" affected neither the warm-cold difference limen nor the heat and cold pain thresholds. Considerable temperature changes (the warming for 5 degrees C and cooling for 10 degrees C) influenced the vibration thresholds measured. Warming increased and cooling decreased the values recorded. Tourniquet-induced ischemia influenced only the vibration disappearance thresholds. Vibration perception and vibration thresholds varied but differences were not significant.", 
    "121": "In 1987 the Swedish Dental Act was amended to allow Swedish dentists who have undergone a specific accreditation course to administer intra-venous sedation. Midazolam is a benzodiazepin derivate with express sedative and hypnotic qualities, powerful amnesia, a short half-life time and few secondary effects. From 1989-1994 midazolam intravenous conscious sedation (ICS) was administered in 372 cases in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, County Hospital, Falun. This study presents data on the 298 patients. Although surgical removal of impacted wisdom teeth predominated, implant surgery, reduction of fractures and correction of anomalies were also carried out. Supplementary sedative premedication was rarely used. Most patients were treated under local anaesthesia. The mean dosage was 10.45 mg (range 1.25-40 mg). Mean dosage/kg was 0.15 mg (range 0.03-0.50 mg). The average duration of anaesthesia was 50 minutes. The average recovery time was 94 minutes. Three hundred and sixty-nine of 372 planned treatments were completed. No serious complications occurred. The patients were co-operative during surgery and were satisfied with the treatment. Compared with full anaesthesia this method required less resources and is a valuable complement in management of anxious patients undergoing oral surgery."
