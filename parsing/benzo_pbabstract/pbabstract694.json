    "0": "Metoclopramide hastens emptying of the stomach. Since it may be given to patients before operation, the sedative and toxic effects of 10- and 20-mg does given i.m. were studied in patients and student volunteers. Saline and diazepam 10 mg were used as placebo and reference drugs. Neither dose of metoclopramide had as good a sedative effect as diazepam 10 mg. Restlessness occurred in a small number of patients but there were no other side effects apart from dryness of the mouth.", 
    "1": "1 In rats trained to a 12 h light-12 h dark cycle, advancing the phase by 6 h produced a resynchronization of the 24 h variation in passive avoidance response (PAR) which was completed after 10 days.2 The attainment of the new steady state was preceded by a period of disruption which was greatest 5 days after phase-shift.3 The presence of chlordiazepoxide (62.5-500 mug/ml) in the drinking water during the days after phase-shift produced a dose-dependent lessening of the disruptive effect of phase-shift, and a more rapid adaptation to the new light-dark cycle.", 
    "2": "The results of a double-blind sequential comparative study conducted on 20 women suffering from menopausal disorders by administering a preparation containing a combination of natural conjugated estrogens and oxazepam and the estrogens alone in the same dose (equivalent to .4 mg of estrone sodium sulphate) are repeated. The combination drug showed considerable therapeutic efficacy and the advantage of being well tolerated, without marked side effects. Both with respect to efficacy and mildness of side effects, the combination was markedly superior to the estrogens administered alone. The findings were confirmed by the subjective evaluation of the patients. Both somatic and psychological-emotional disorders, such as insomnia and loss of libido, showed considerable improvement. It is concluded that the addition of oxazepam or a similar drug to the estrogens is safe and effective in the treatment of menopausal disorders.", 
    "3": "Interaction of 21 benzodiazepines with the glycine receptor in the brainstem and spinal cord of rat have been evaluated in terms of their displacement of [(3)H]strychinine binding. The rank order of potency of the 21 drugs in displacing specific [(3)H]strychinine binding correlates (p < 0.005) with their rank order of potency in a vareity of pharmacological and behavioral tests in humans and animals that predict clinical efficacy. There is a 50-fold variation in potency of the series of benzodiazepines with mean effective dose (ED(50)) values ranging from 19muM to > 1000 muM. Diazepam (Valium(R)) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium(R)) have ED(50)'s of 26 muM and 200 muM, respectively, whereas the ED(50) for glycine is 25 muM. The inhibitory effects of 10 of the agents in two other central nervous system membrane receptor assays, for the opiate receptor and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, do not correlate with any of the in vivo pharmacologic and behavioral tests. The benzodiazepines may exert their antianxiety, anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effects by mimicking the effects of the neurotransmitter glycine at its central nervous system receptor sites."
