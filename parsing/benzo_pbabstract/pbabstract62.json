The [1,4]-benzodiazepine has unique structure that mimics the peptide linkage. This interesting observation completely shifted the interest of medicinal chemist for [1,4]-benzodiazepine from CNS acting drugs to anticancer agent. During last few decades, large number of reports has appeared in the literature highlighting the anticancer activity of [1,4]-benzodiazepines. Here, in this article, we have discussed the brief synthesis, origin of [1,4]-benzodiazepines as anticancer agent, its mechanism of action and latest developments in this field. We have compiled the most important literature reports from last few decades to till date.", 
    "1": "A growing body of evidence shows that gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is an addictive substance. Its precursors gammabutyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) show the same properties and may pose even more risks due to different pharmacokinetics. There are indications that problematic GHB use is increasing in the European Union. This review investigates the existing literature on the neurochemistry of GHB and its precursors, their acute toxicity, addiction potential and withdrawal, the proposed molecular mechanism underlying addiction and the treatment of withdrawal and addiction. Current evidence shows that GHB and its precursors are highly addictive, both in humans and animals, probably through a GABAB receptor related mechanism. Severity of withdrawal symptoms can be considered as a medical emergency. Recent studies suggest that benzodiazepines are not very effective, showing a high treatment resistance, whereas detoxification with pharmaceutical GHB proved to be successful. However, relapse in GHB use is frequent and more research is warranted on relapse prevention. This might aid medical practitioners in the field and improve general understanding of the severity of addiction to GHB, GBL and 1,4-BD.",

The analyte was extracted from human plasma with diethyl ether, reaching an average recovery of 64.02 and 66.48% for clonazepam and the internal standard, respectively. The separation was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (50 x 2.1 mm id, 1.7 microm particle size) with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min using a 0.5% formic acid solution (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile-methanol-formic acid (75+25 + 0.5, v/v/v; mobile phase B). Detection was performed on a triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer in the multiple reaction monitoring mode via electrospray ionization. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range of 0.3-50.0 ng/mL, with an LOQ of 0.3 ng/mL. The intraday and interday precision (CV) values were below 10%, and accuracy (relative error) ranged from -2.6 to 6.6% at all QC levels.

    "3": "Ras homolog enriched in striatum (Rhes), is a highly conserved small guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) binding protein belonging to the Ras superfamily. Rhes is involved in the dopamine receptor-mediated signaling and behavior though adenylyl cyclase. The striatum-specific GTPase share a close homology with Dexras1, which regulates iron trafficking in the neurons when activated though the post-translational modification called s-nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO). We report that Rhes physiologically interacted with Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein7 and participated in iron uptake via divalent metal transporter 1 similar to Dexras1. Interestingly, Rhes is not S-nitrosylated by NO-treatment, however phosphorylated by protein kinase A at the site of serine-239. Two Rhes mutants - the phosphomimetic form (serine 239 to aspartic acid) and constitutively active form (alanine 173 to valine) - displayed an increase in iron uptake compared to the wild-type Rhes. These findings suggest that Rhes may play a crucial role in striatal iron homeostasis.",

Three experimental set-ups were employed: two lab-scale photoreactors, each provided with an UV lamp (one medium pressure mercury lamp and one blacklight blue lamp), and a pilot-scale Solar Plant with Compound Parabolic Collectors (CPCs). Samples collected along the different phototreatment experiments were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QqToF-MS). The key assumption of the analytical approach was that related compounds (LZP and its by-products (LBPs)) provide identical \"diagnostic fragment ions\". Identification was also based on the chlorine atoms specific isotopic pattern, as well as accurate masses. Six major LBPs were identified and elucidated, with nominal [M + H](+) masses of 337, 303, 319, 275, 291 and 293 Da. The proposed LZP photodegradation mechanism included the initial opening of the diazepinone seven-membered ring, followed by a rearrangement into a highly stabilized six-membered aromatic ring and subsequent cleavage and/or hydroxylation reactions. The evolution profiles of LBPs were described for each of the three experimental prototypes and the CPCs Solar Pilot Plant proved to be the most efficient one. Finally, LZP photocatalytic degradation was further assessed on a municipal effluent, where the photoproducts generated showed to be more persistent than LZP itself.",

Recent evidence has showed that co-treatment of betahistine (a histaminergic H1 receptor agonist and H3 receptor antagonist) is effective for preventing olanzapine-induced weight gain/obesity, however it is not clear whether this co-treatment affects on the primary therapeutic receptor binding sites of olanzapine such as serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2AR) and dopaminergic D2 receptors (D2R). Therefore, this study investigated the effects of this co-treatment on 5-HT2AR, 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) and D2R bindings in various brain regions involved in antipsychotic efficacy. Female Sprague Dawley rats were administered orally (t.i.d.) with either olanzapine (1mg/kg), betahistine (2.7 mg/kg), olanzapine plus betahistine (O+B), or vehicle (control) for 2 weeks. Quantitative autoradiography was used to detect the density of [(3)H]ketanserin, [(3)H]paroxetine and [(3)H]raclopride binding site to 5-HT2AR, 5-HTT and D2R. Compared to the controls, olanzapine significantly decreased [(3)H]ketanserin bindings to 5-HT2AR in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Similar changes in 5-HT2AR bindings in these nuclei were also observed in the O+B co-treatment group. Olanzapine also significantly decreased [(3)H]paroxetine binding to 5-HTT in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, however, both olanzapine only and O+B co-treatment did not affect [(3)H]raclopride binding to D2R. The results confirmed the important role of 5-HT2AR in the efficacy of olanzapine, which is not influenced by the O+B co-treatment. Therefore, betahistine co-treatment would be an effective combination therapy to reduce olanzapine-induced weight gain side-effects without affecting olanzapine's actions on 5-HT2AR transmissions.",

Propofol is a short-acting hypnotic with a potential risk of respiratory depression at levels of moderate to deep sedation. The existing literature on capnography for endoscopy patients sedated with nurse-administered propofol sedation (NAPS) is limited. Can the addition of capnography to standard monitoring during endoscopy with NAPS reduce the number, duration, and level of hypoxia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study was a randomized controlled trial with an intervention group (capnography) and a control group (without capnography). Eligible subjects were consecutive patients for endoscopy at Gentofte Hospital compliant with the criteria of NAPS. RESULTS. Five hundred and forty patients, 263 with capnography and 277 without capnography, were included in the analysis. The number and total duration of hypoxia was reduced by 39.3% and 21.1% in the intervention group compared to the control group (p > 0.05). No differences in actions taken against insufficient respiration were found. Changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide (R = 0.177, p-value < 0.001) and respiratory rate (R = 0.092, p-value < 0.001) were correlated to oxygen saturation (SpO2) up to 36 s prior to changes in SpO2. CONCLUSIONS. Capnography seems to reduce the number and duration of hypoxia in NAPS patients (p > 0.05). Capnography is able to detect insufficient respiration that may lead to hypoxia prior to changes in pulse oximetry. However, due to a limited clinical benefit and additional costs associated with capnography, we do not find capnography necessary during the use of NAPS.",

In this paper, we will summarize current epidemiological, clinical, and EEG knowledge on CSWS and will provide suggestions for treatment. CSWS typically presents with seizures around 2-4 years of age. Neurocognitive regression occurs around 5-6 years of age, and it is accompanied by subacute worsening of EEG abnormalities and seizures. At approximately 6-9 years of age, there is a gradual resolution of seizures and EEG abnormalities, but the neurocognitive deficits persist in most patients. The cause of CSWS is unknown, but early developmental lesions play a major role in approximately half of the patients, and genetic associations have recently been described.

In subjects experiencing a suboptimal response [\u226516 points on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at screening and baseline] or intolerance, olanzapine was switched to ziprasidone while maintaining the same dose of their current combined mood stabilizer during the 8-week trial. The primary efficacy measure was the mean change in the YMRS total score. Metabolic parameters were measured to evaluate the improvement in metabolic syndrome.", 
    "59": "A total of 56 patients were enrolled, and 46 (82.1 %) completed this study. Switching to ziprasidone was effective and well-tolerated. YMRS total scores were significantly reduced over 8 weeks (mean change, -10.4 \u00b1 10.2). There were significant improvements in metabolic parameters, with mean changes of -0.4 \u00b1 0.8 kg/m(2) in body mass index (BMI), -1.2 \u00b1 2.5 kg in body weight, -21.3 \u00b1 62.7 mg/dL in the fasting triglyceride level, and -13.2 \u00b1 26.6 mg/dL in the total cholesterol level.

    "61": "Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent group of psychiatric diseases, and have high personal and societal costs. The search for novel pharmacological treatments for these conditions is driven by the growing medical need to improve on the effectiveness and the side effect profile of existing drugs. A huge volume of data has been generated by anxiolytic drug discovery studies, which has led to the progression of numerous new molecules into clinical trials. However, the clinical outcome of these efforts has been disappointing, as promising results with novel agents in rodent studies have very rarely translated into effectiveness in humans. Here, we analyse the major trends from preclinical studies over the past 50 years conducted in the search for new drugs beyond those that target the prototypical anxiety-associated GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid)-benzodiazepine system, which have focused most intensively on the serotonin, neuropeptide, glutamate and endocannabinoid systems. We highlight various key issues that may have hampered progress in the field, and offer recommendations for how anxiolytic drug discovery can be more effective in the future.",

However, the possibility that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) might affect M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease or other neurotological consequences was not noticed, until studies using polysomnography for these patients.", 
    "63": "OSAS may cause not only vestibular but also auditory dysfunction. Several reports suggest that insufficient supply of blood via the vertebral basilar artery, which supplies the inner ear, may cause hydropic distension of the endolymphatic system and lead to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. However, few people noticed that in OSAS this insufficient supply might be exacerbated in the night while patients are sleeping. Even more, we should note that M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's patients may not only suffer from insomnia, but also that the impaired sleep might be caused by OSAS.",

The new generation of GABAA modulators is targeting subtype selectivity and low/partial efficacy on the receptor to potentially overcome the adverse effects described for drugs with full agonist profile. We evaluated a screening approach to measure the relative efficacy of GABAA positive allosteric modulators (PAM) using automated patch clamp and fluorescence membrane potential assays. We determined that the use of an internal comparator (zolpidem), tested on each cell in parallel to the test compound, provides a reliable approach to measure and compare the relative efficacy of PAM ligands. Patch clamp recordings on recombinant GABAA receptors, using a multiple drug addition protocol, allows us to rank PAM ligands with different levels of efficacies. We observed that fluorescence membrane potential assays are not predictive of the relative efficacies of GABAA PAM ligands.",

    "70": "A comparative understanding of effluent quality of decentralized on-site wastewater treatment systems, particularly for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), remains less understood than effluent quality from centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants. Using a novel experimental facility with common influent wastewater, effluent water quality from a decentralized advanced aerobic treatment system (ATS) and a typical septic treatment system (STS) coupled to a subsurface flow constructed wetland (WET) were compared to effluent from a centralized municipal treatment plant (MTP). The STS did not include soil treatment, which may represent a system not functioning properly. Occurrence and discharge of a range of CECs were examined using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry during fall and winter seasons. Conventional parameters, including total suspended solids, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand and nutrients were also evaluated from each treatment system. Water quality of these effluents was further examined using a therapeutic hazard modeling approach. Of 19 CECs targeted for study, the benzodiazepine pharmaceutical diazepam was the only CEC not detected in all wastewater influent and effluent samples over two sampling seasons. Diphenhydramine, codeine, diltiazem, atenolol, and diclofenac exhibited significant (p<0.05) seasonal differences in wastewater influent concentrations. Removal of CECs by these wastewater treatment systems was generally not influenced by season. However, significant differences (p<0.05) for a range of water quality indicators were observed among the various treatment technologies. For example, removal of most CECs by ATS was generally comparable to MTP. Lowest removal of most CECs was observed for STS; however, removal was improved when coupling the STS to a WET. Across the treatment systems examined, the majority of pharmaceuticals observed in on-site and municipal effluent discharges were predicted to potentially present therapeutic hazards to fish.", 
    "71": "Lesatropane, a synthesized chiral tropane (3S, 6S-isomer of satropane), is a novel muscarinic agonist, and is being under preclinical development in China for the treatment of primary glaucoma. The reports concerning that activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) could protect cells against apoptosis prompted us to study the neuroprotective effects of lesatropane and the mechanism. We found that lesatropane could protect PC12 cells from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and reverse the decreased ERK1/2 activation caused by glutamate. Atropine or pirenzepine, antagonist of mAChR or M1 mAChR, antagonized the protective effects of lesatropane respectively and suppressed the lesatropane's effects on ERK1/2. Furthermore, chelerythrine, a PKC inhibitor, partially suppressed ERK1/2 activation induced by lesatropane. The results indicated that the specific M1 mAChR via PKC-ERK1/2 pathway might be involved in the neuroprotective effects of lesatropane. While M1 mAChR is a therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the results of this paper contribute to further information concerning the activation of M1 mAChR as a therapeutic target in AD.",

Nine formulations were prepared by changing the concentration of chitosan, PEG 400 and heating time. The alprazolam entrapment efficiency of these nanoparticles was in the range of 68.12\u00b11.27 to 99.37\u00b14.86%. These nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, DSC, P-XRD and FE-SEM analysis. Average particle diameter, poly-dispersity index and zeta potential of these nanoparticles were found 259.60 nm, 0.501, and -9.00 mV, respectively. The in vitro drug release from these alprazolam-loaded nanoparticles showed sustained drug release over a period of 24h.

We conducted a retrospective study between 1st May and 22nd May 2011 in Grenoble University Hospital in France. All patients receiving midazolam during the study period were included, excepted if the prescription was performed in intensive care units, operating rooms or in pediatric units. Physicians from the different units were asked about the characteristics of patients receiving midazolam and about their practice concerning the use of midazolam. Forty-four patients were included, 82 % of whom having a cancer. The prevalence of prescription of midazolam was 3.3 % (44/1,323), 2.8 % (37/1,323) for anxiety relieving and 0.8 % (11/1,323) for sedation. The main refractory symptoms that justified the prescription were dyspnea (36.4 %), confusion (29.5 %), pain (27.3 %) and psychological suffering (27.3 %). Twenty-eight physicians were asked about their practice. The main representations of midazolam were the stop of active treatment (46.5 %) and premature cause of death (46.5 %). Practice of sedation is under-estimated by physicians as they have difficulties to differentiate anxiety relieving and sedation and they have difficulties to initiate a sedation.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Ranitidine in attenuating or preventing Olanzapine-induced weight gain. A parallel 2-arm clinical trial was done on 52 patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorders who received Olanzapine for the first time. All these were first-episode admitted patients. They were randomly allocated to receive either Ranitidine or placebo. The trend of body mass index (BMI) was compared between groups over 16-week course of treatment. Mean weight was 62.3 (SD: 9.6)\u2009kg at baseline. Thirty-three subjects (63.5%) had positive family history of obesity. The average BMI increment was 1.1 for Ranitidine group and 2.4 for the placebo group. The multivariate analysis showed this effect to be independent of sex, family history of obesity, and baseline BMI value. The longitudinal modeling after controlling for baseline values failed to show the whole trend slope to be different. Although the slight change in trend's slope puts forward a hypothesis that combined use of Ranitidine and Olanzapine may attenuate the weight gain long run, this needs to be retested in future larger scale long-term studies.

    "80": "The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is a widely expressed transporter for endogenous and exogenous organic cations. Of particular interest is OCT3 expression and function in the brain, where it plays a role in serotonin clearance and influences mood and behavior. Protein kinase signaling mediates rapid modulation of cerebral processes, but little is known about acute regulation of OCT3 by protein kinases. Therefore, we cloned mouse OCT3 (mOCT3) and generated a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the transporter to study transport characteristics, acute regulation by protein kinases, and interaction with psychotropic drugs. Uptake measurement was performed using the fluorescent cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+), 1\u00a0\u03bcM) as a substrate. The translational value of these findings was determined by comparing results obtained with cloned mouse and human OCT3. mOCT3-mediated transport is membrane potential dependent and pH independent. ASP(+) uptake by mOCT3 and human OCT3 (hOCT3) was efficiently inhibited by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, tetrapentylammonium (TPA(+)), corticosterone, serotonin, and histamine and by the drugs ketamine, fluoxetine, and diazepam. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations of mOCT3 and hOCT3 for TPA(+), serotonin, diazepam, and ketamine are significantly different. Diazepam is a non-transported inhibitor. Furthermore, the activities of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are acutely regulated by the p56 (lck) tyrosine kinase by decreasing their V max. Studies with freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from mOCT1/2(-/-) mice, in which mOCT3 is the only OCT present, confirmed this regulation pathway. Only the activity of hOCT3 is regulated by calmodulin. These findings suggest that even though many transport properties of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are similar, there are also species-specific aspects of OCT3 function.",

    "85": "Cocaine is a commonly abused illicit drug that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Although there is no true antidote to cocaine toxicity, current management strategies address the life-threatening systemic effects, namely hyperthermia, vasospasm, and severe hypertension. Clinicians rely on rapid cooling, benzodiazepines, and \u03b1-adrenergic antagonists for management, with years of proven benefit. Experimental agents have been developed to more effectively treat acute toxicity. Pharmacodynamic approaches include antipsychotics that are thought to interfere with cocaine's actions at several neurotransmitter receptors. However, these medications may worsen the consequences of cocaine toxicity as they can interfere with heat dissipation, cause arrhythmias, and lower the seizure threshold. Pharmacokinetic approaches use cocaine-metabolizing enzymes, such as butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), cocaine hydrolase (CocH), and bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE). Experimental models with these therapies improve survival, primarily when administered before cocaine, although newer evidence demonstrates beneficial effects shortly after cocaine toxicity has manifested. CocE, a foreign protein, can induce an immune response with antibody formation. When enzyme administration was combined with vaccination against the cocaine molecule, improvement in cocaine-induced locomotor activity was observed. Finally, lipid emulsion rescue has been described in human case reports as an effective treatment in patients with hemodynamic compromise because of cocaine, which correlates well with its documented benefit in toxicity due to other local anesthetics. A pharmaceutical developed from these concepts will need to be expedient in onset and effective with minimal adverse effects while at the same time being economical.", 
    "86": "Certain women experience negative mood symptoms during the menstrual cycle and progesterone addition in estrogen treatments. In women with PMDD increased negative mood symptoms related to allopregnanolone increase during the luteal phase of ovulatory menstrual cycles. In anovulatory cycles no symptom or sex steroid increase occurs. This is unexpected as positive modulators of the GABA-A receptor are generally increasing mood. This paradoxical effect has brought forward a hypothesis that the symptoms are provoked by allopregnanolone the GABA-A receptor system. GABA-A is the major inhibitory system in the brain. Positive modulators of the GABA-A receptor include the progesterone metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. GABA-A receptor modulators are known, in low concentrations to induce adverse, anxiogenic effects whereas in higher concentrations show beneficial, calming properties. Positive GABA-A receptor modulators induce strong paradoxical effects e.g. negative mood in 3-8% of those exposed, while up to 25% have moderate symptoms thus similar as the prevalence of PMDD, 3-8% among women in fertile ages, and up to 25% have moderate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The mechanism behind paradoxical reaction might be similar among them who react on positive GABA-A receptor modulators and in women with PMDD. In women the severity of these mood symptoms are related to the allopregnanolone serum concentrations in an inverted U-shaped curve. Negative mood symptoms occur when the serum concentration of allopregnanolone is similar to endogenous luteal phase levels, while low and high concentrations have less effect on mood. Low to moderate progesterone/allopregnanolone concentrations in women increases the activity in the amygdala (measured with fMRI) similar to the changes seen during anxiety reactions. Higher concentrations give decreased amygdala activity similar as seen during benzodiazepine treatment with calming anxiolytic effects. Patients with PMDD show decreased sensitivity in GABA-A receptor sensitivity to diazepam and pregnanolone while increased sensitivity to allopregnanolone. This agrees with findings in animals showing a relation between changes in alpha4 and delta subunits of the GABA-A receptor and anxiogenic effects of allopregnanolone.",

Glabridin is a major flavonoid component from licorice which we evaluated by examining GABA responses in acutely isolated dorsal raphe neurons of the rat. Neurons were recorded with patch-clamp methods at a holding potential of - 50 mV. Glabridin potentiated GABA-induced responses by positively modulating GABAA receptor responses with different concentration range. GABA (2 \u00d7 10(-6) M)-evoked currents were potentiated in a stepwise pattern increasing glabridin concentration. Between 10(-12) and 10(-8) M glabridin increased GABA responses by about 140 % of the control. At concentrations above 10(-7) M, a much larger, dose-dependent potentiation occurred before reaching a plateau at 3 \u00d7 10-6 M glabridin. A hypnotic drug, zolpidem, also induced biphasic concentration-potentiation relationship. The glabridin potentiation ratio was 2.2 times larger than the maximum potentiation to the benzodiazepine receptor full agonist diazepam. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (3 \u00d7 10(-7) M), failed to inhibit glabridin (3 \u00d7 10(-7) M)-induced potentiation. This result implies that glabridin may exhibit sedative and hypnotic effects by potentiating GABAergic inhibition in dorsal raphe neurons by GABAA receptor actions.",

This traditional use led to the present investigation of R. rosea in the context of anxiety disorders. An alcohol extract of R. rosea roots was characterized phytochemically and orally administered for three consecutive days to Sprague-Dawley rats at 8 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 75 mg/kg body weight. The rats were subjected to three behavioral paradigms of anxiety, including the elevated plus maze, social interaction, and contextual conditioned emotional response tests. Rhodiola rosea showed dose-dependent anxiolytic activity in the elevated plus maze and conditioned emotional response tests, with moderate effects in the higher-anxiety SI test. The active dose varied according to the anxiety test. In order to elucidate a mechanism, the extract was further tested in an in vitro GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor-binding assay, where it demonstrated low activity. This study provides the first comparative assessment of the anxiolytic activity of Nunavik R. rosea in several behaviour models and suggests that anxiolytic effects may be primarily mediated via pathways other than the GABAA-benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "90": "Dexmedetomidine is currently used in the US in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, although data to support this practice are limited. Dexmedetomidine targets the noradrenergic system, an important but frequently overlooked secondary mechanism in the development of AWS, and, in doing so, may reduce the need for excessive benzodiazepine use which can increase the risk of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated deliriogenesis and respiratory depression. The purpose of this narrative review is to evaluate available literature reporting on the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine for AWS in the ICU setting. An English-language MEDLINE search (1966 to July 2013) was performed to identify articles evaluating the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for AWS. Case series, case reports and controlled trials were evaluated for topic relevance and clinical applicability. Reference lists of articles retrieved through this search were reviewed to identify any relevant publications. Studies focusing on the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine for AWS in humans were selected. Studies were included if they were published as full articles; abstracts alone were not included in this review. Eight published case studies and case series were identified. Based on a limited body of evidence, dexmedetomidine shows promise as a potentially safe and possibly effective adjuvant treatment for AWS in the ICU. Prospective, well-controlled studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of the use of dexmedetomidine in AWS.",

Because the time course after drug treatment discontinuation has received little attention, we aimed to clarify the chronological changes of rifampicin-induced CYP enzyme activities after rifampicin discontinuation. Thirteen volunteers took 450\u2009mg of rifampicin once daily, and the cocktail method, which uses caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and midazolam as CYP-specific probes, was repeatedly used for the evaluation of CYP levels. Concentrations of probes and metabolites were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Seven-day rifampicin administration increased CYP2C19 and CYP3A enzyme activities. The induced CYP2C19 and CYP3A activities remained elevated at 4 days after rifampicin discontinuation and returned to baseline levels 8 days after rifampicin discontinuation. CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzyme activities showed no significant changes, and CYP2C9 enzyme activity was increased with rifampicin administration, with a tendency toward statistical significance. Drug interactions can occur even after rifampicin discontinuation.",

    "96": "Treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs is known to increase the risk of glucose intolerance and diabetes. However, the mechanism of this effect is unclear. Since central adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an important role in regulating nutrient homeostasis, the present study was performed to examine the involvement of central AMPK in the glucose intolerance induced by olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, in mice. Acute intraperitoneal treatment with olanzapine dose-dependently increased blood glucose levels in the glucose tolerance test. Intracerebroventricular administration of olanzapine also increased blood glucose levels in the glucose tolerance test. The glucose intolerance induced by both intraperitoneal and intracerebroventricular treatment with olanzapine was significantly attenuated by intracerebroventricular pretreatment with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Intracerebroventricular treatment with the AMPK activator AICAR increased blood glucose levels in the glucose tolerance test, and this increase was inhibited by compound C. Moreover, the hypothalamic level of phosphorylated AMPK after glucose injection was significantly increased by intracerebroventricular pretreatment with olanzapine. Olanzapine did not affect plasma glucagon and insulin levels. Our results indicate that acute treatment with olanzapine causes glucose intolerance through the activation of hypothalamic AMPK. The present study suggests that the inhibition of central AMPK activity may have a therapeutic effect on the metabolic disturbance induced by atypical antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "97": "Reuse of treated wastewater to irrigate agricultural crops is increasing in many arid and semi-arid areas around the world. The presence of numerous pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in treated wastewater and their potential transfer into food produce such as vegetables poses an unknown human health risk. The goal of this study was to identify PPCPs that have a comparatively high potential for plant uptake and translocation. A total of 20 frequently-occurring PPCPs were compared for their accumulation into four staple vegetables (lettuce, spinach, cucumber, and pepper) grown in nutrient solutions containing PPCPs at 0.5 or 5\u03bcgL(-1). Triclocarban, fluoxetine, triclosan, and diazepam were found at high levels in roots, while meprobamate, primidone, carbamazepine, dilantin, and diuron exhibited more active translocation from roots to leaves. Root uptake of neutral PPCPs was positively correlated with the pH adjusted log Kow(i.e., log Dow), and was likely driven by chemical adsorption onto the root surfaces. In contrast, translocation from roots to leaves was negatively related to log Dow, suggesting hydrophilicity-regulated transport via xylems. Compounds preferentially sorbed to roots should be further evaluated for their uptake in tuber vegetables (e.g., carrot, radish) under field conditions, while those easily translocated into leaves (e.g., carbamazepine, dilantin) merit focused consideration for leafy and other vegetables (e.g., lettuce, cucumber). However, estimation of dietary intake by humans suggested the implied risks from exposure to PPCPs via wastewater irrigation to be negligible.",

The mechanism may be related to the neuronal quiescence or inactivity associated with anesthetic exposure. Few data exist on how brief anesthetic exposure may affect neurodevelopment in the newborn. Good evidence however shows that untreated pain and stress have an adverse effect on neurodevelopment, and therefore, at this stage, providing effective analgesia, sedation, and anesthesia would seem to be more important than concern over neurotoxicity.", 
    "99": "Regardless of age, health care professionals have a professional and ethical obligation to provide safe and effective analgesia to patients undergoing painful procedures. Historically, newborns, particularly premature and sick infants, have been undertreated for pain. Intubation of the trachea and mechanical ventilation are ubiquitous painful procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit that are poorly assessed and treated. The authors review the use of sedation and analgesia to facilitate endotracheal tube placement and mechanical ventilation. Controversies regarding possible adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes after sedative and anesthetic exposure and in the failure to treat pain is also discussed.",

Overt HE (OHE) presents as a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms, ranging in severity from mild confusion to life-threatening coma. Minimal HE (MHE) is a more subtle form of the condition; it is characterized by deficits in cognitive function in patients with a normal clinical examination.",

Because MHE lacks obvious clinical signs, specialized testing is required for diagnosis, although there is no consensus on the most appropriate assessment tools or treatment algorithms. Compounds derived from bacterial activities in the gut can cause neurochemical changes in the brain. These gut-derived toxins (eg, ammonia, benzodiazepine-like substances) are implicated in the pathophysiology of OHE. In patients with liver disease or portosystemic shunting, these toxins are inefficiently detoxified, accumulate in the blood, cross the blood-brain barrier, and result in abnormalities such as altered neurotransmission, astrocyte swelling, and impaired energy metabolism. Therefore, treatments have focused on toxin removal and the management of gut flora levels. Several studies have indicated that probiotics, nonabsorbable disaccharides, and nonsystemic antibiotics can all be effective in improving the symptoms of MHE. Furthermore, prophylaxis for MHE in patients with cirrhosis could serve to improve patient quality of life while preventing its transition to OHE.", 
    "104": "Although MHE detection and treatment is not currently the standard of care, several therapies have been reported to improve cognitive function and quality of life. Interest is increasing in the proactive diagnosis and management of MHE in the clinical practice setting.

    "108": "This report entails a multifaceted approach to benzodiazepine (BZ) action, involving electron affinity, receptors, cell signaling and other aspects. Computations of the electron affinities (EAs) of different BZs have been carried out to establish the effect of various substituents on their EA. These computations were undertaken to serve as a first step in determining what role electron transfer (ET) plays in BZ activity. The calculations were conducted on the premise that the nature of the substituent will either decrease or increase the electron density of the benzene ring, thus altering the ability of the molecule to accept an electron. Investigations were performed on the effect of drug protonation on EA. Similarities involving substituent effects in prior electrochemical studies are also discussed. As part of the multifaceted approach, EA is linked to ET, which appears to play a role in therapeutic activity and toxicity. There is extensive literature dealing with the role of receptors in BZ activity. Significant information on receptor involvement was reported more than 40 years ago. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is known to be importantly involved. GABA is a probable mediator of BZ effects. BZ and GABA receptors, although not identical, are physiologically linked. Cell signaling is known to play a part in the biochemistry of BZ action. Various factors participated, such as gene expression, allosteric influence, toxic effects and therapeutic action. Evidence points to involvement of EA and ET in the mode of action in cell signaling. Oxidative stress and antioxidant effects are also addressed.",

Understanding how to elicit goals of care from dying patients and initiate basic palliative measures is well within the scope of emergency medicine. While a wide variety of factors drive patients at the end of life into the acute-care setting, dyspnea is one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by dying patients, and it is a common reason for such patients to seek care. Many underlying disease states and acute illnesses account for shortness of breath at the end of life, and management tends to be symptomatic rather than diagnostic, particularly in those for whom comfort is the most important goal. Opioids are the most effective and widely studied agents available for palliation of dyspnea in this population, while adjuvant therapies such as oxygen, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and fans may also play a role. Other medications (eg, benzodiazepines and low-dose ketamine) may also be useful in select patients. The early involvement of palliative medicine specialists and/or hospice services for dying patients can facilitate optimal symptom management and transitions of care.", 
    "125": "Mitochondria play important roles in cancer progression and have emerged as viable targets for cancer therapy. Increasing levels of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), are associated with advancing breast cancer stage. In particular, higher TSPO levels are found in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast tumors, compared with ER-positive tumors. In this study, we sought to define the roles of TSPO in the acquisition of breast cancer malignancy. Using a three-dimensional Matrigel culture system, we determined the impact of elevated TSPO levels on mammary epithelial morphogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that stable overexpression of TSPO in mammary epithelial MCF10A acini drives proliferation and provides partial resistance to luminal apoptosis, resulting in enlarged acinar structures with partially filled lumen that resemble early stage breast lesions leading to breast cancer. In breast cancer cell lines, TSPO silencing or TSPO overexpression significantly altered the migratory activity. In addition, we found that combination treatment with the TSPO ligands (PK 11195 or Ro5-4864) and lonidamine, a clinical phase II drug targeting mitochondria, decreased viability of ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, these data demonstrate that increases in TSPO levels at different stages of breast cancer progression results in the acquisition of distinct properties associated with malignancy. Furthermore, targeting TSPO, particularly in combination with other mitochondria-targeting agents, may prove useful for the treatment of ER-negative breast cancer.",

The effects of EMA on the anxiolytic-like behaviour were studied using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and hole-board test. To elucidate the mode of action of the anxiolytic-like effects of EMA, the mice were subjected to the co-administration of EMA (200\u2009mg/kg, per os (p.o.)) and either antagonist. EMA (at 200 or 400\u2009mg/kg) significantly increased the percentages of time-spent in the open arms and entries into the open arms of the EPM versus vehicle-treated control group (p<0.05). Moreover, in the hole-board test, EMA (200 and 400\u2009mg/kg) significantly increased the number of head-dips versus vehicle-treated control group (p<0.05). However, there were no changes in the locomotor activity and myorelaxant effects in any group compared with the vehicle-treated control group. In addition, the anxiolytic-like effects of EMA were abolished by thioperamide (10\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), which is a histamine H3 receptor antagonist. Moreover, results from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) also revealed that the amygdalal histidine decarboxylase mRNA expression levels in EMA (200\u2009mg/kg)-treated group were significantly higher than those in the vehicle-treated controls (p<0.05). These results suggest that EMA might prove to be an effective anxiolytic agent and that EMA acts via the histaminergic system in central nerve system.",

    "132": "Hippocampal neurogenesis is accelerated during the elevation of hippocampal neural activities under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. One of these conditions, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), induces both the hyperactivities of hippocampal network and the elevation of neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation. However, the causal relationship between the elevated activity and the elevation of NSC proliferation is still unclear. In this study, to block the elevation of hippocampal activity after MCAO in mice, we utilized a typical \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptor active modulator, diazepam. With MCAO mice treated with diazepam, we observed complete disappearance of the elevation of hippocampal activity. Additionally, the diazepam treatment blocked the elevation of NSC proliferation after MCAO. From this result, it is speculated that the increased NSC proliferation is blocked by the suppression of elevated neural activity. However, diazepam might have effects other than the suppression of hippocampal activity, so we performed additional experiment and found that diazepam did not affect the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells under the normal condition, whereas the GABA agonist pentobarbital stimulated NSC/neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Next, we evaluated the expression of the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) protein and found that the cells expressed DBI in soma and on the surface of cell membrane. From these observations, we can propose that diazepam blocks the elevation of hippocampal activity and also NSC proliferation after MCAO.",

According to the DSC thermogram, the solvents can be divided into four classes: those that do not form solvates and leave olanzapine form 1 (ethyl acetate, toluene, diethyl ether, and acetone); those that form solvate and leave form 1 of olanzapine after desolvation (methanol, 1- and 2-propanol); those that after desolvation of the solvate show a polymorph transition in the thermogram indicating the presence of form 2 of olanzapine (ethanol); other solvents (tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, acetonitrile) give solvate thermograms, where this last thermal trace is only poorly evident. With few exceptions, each solvent forms solvate both when pure and in mixture (10%, v/v, in ethyl acetate). Methanol monosolvate displays complex thermogram and thermogravimetric desolvation profiles, depending on the crystallization experimental conditions, used to prepare the solvates. Dichloromethane solvate was found by X-ray diffraction analysis to be amorphous and, on heating during DSC analysis, allowed the crystallization of both form 1 and 2, with different weight ratio, according to the experimental conditions of the solvate preparation.",

The objective of this work was to evaluate a seizure advisory system (SAS) that alerts caregivers of seizures in canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Four dogs with epilepsy were implanted with a SAS that wirelessly transmits continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) to an external device embedded with a seizure detection algorithm and the capability to alert caregivers. In this study a veterinarian was alerted by automated text message if prolonged or repetitive seizures occurred, and a rescue therapy protocol was implemented. The performance of the SAS caregiver alert was evaluated over the course of 8 weeks. Following discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs, the dogs experienced spontaneous unprovoked partial seizures that secondarily generalized. Three prolonged or repetitive seizure episodes occurred in 2 of the dogs. On each occasion, the SAS caregiver alert successfully alerted an on call veterinarian who confirmed the seizure activity via remote video-monitoring. A rescue medication was then administered and the seizures were aborted. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a SAS to alert caregivers to the occurrence of prolonged or repetitive seizures and enables rescue medications to be delivered in a timely manner. The SAS may improve the management of human epilepsy by alerting caregivers of seizures, enabling early interventions, and potentially improving outcomes and quality of life of patients and caregivers.",

Primary hepatocytes in suspension are routinely used to predict in vivo clearance; however, incubation times have typically been limited to 4-6 hours, which is not long enough to accurately evaluate the metabolic stability of slowly metabolized compounds. HepatoPac is a micropatterened hepatocyte-fibroblast coculture system that can be used for continuous incubations of up to 7 days. This study evaluated the ability of human HepatoPac to predict the in vivo clearance (CL) of 17 commercially available compounds with low to intermediate clearance (<12 ml/min per kg). In vitro half-life for disappearance of each compound was converted to hepatic clearance using the well stirred model, with and without correction for plasma protein binding. Hepatic CL, using three individual donors, was accurately predicted for 10 of 17 compounds (59%; predicted clearance within 2-fold of observed human in vivo clearance values). The accuracy of prediction increased to 76% (13 of 17 compounds) with an acceptance criterion defined as within 3-fold. When considering only low clearance compounds (<5 ml/min per kg), which represented 10 of the 17 compounds, the accuracy of prediction was 60% within 2-fold and 90% within 3-fold. In addition, the turnover of three slowly metabolized compounds (alprazolam, meloxicam, and tolbutamide) in HepatoPac was directly compared with turnover in suspended hepatocytes. The turnover of alprazolam and tolbutamide was approximately 2-fold greater using HepatoPac compared with suspended hepatocytes, which was roughly in line with the extrapolated values (correcting for the longer incubation time and lower cell number with HepatoPac). HepatoPac, but not suspended hepatocytes, demonstrated significant turnover of meloxicam. These results demonstrate the utility of HepatoPac for prediction of in vivo hepatic clearance, particularly with low clearance compounds.",

Participants with a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression had the highest mean loneliness scores, followed by those with lung disease and those with heart disease. Furthermore, participants with mood disorders, lung disease, or heart disease had significantly higher loneliness scores than those without these conditions.

    "161": "The study aimed at validating an increasing-temperature water bath suitable for determining the noxious heat threshold for use in mice. The noxious heat threshold was determined by immersing the tail of the gently held awake mouse into a water container whose temperature was near-linearly increased at a rate of 24\u00b0C/min. until the animal withdrew its tail, that is, heating attained the noxious threshold. The effects of standard analgesic, neuroleptic and anxiolytic drugs were investigated in a parallel way on both the noxious heat threshold and the psychomotor activity assessed by the open field test. Morphine, diclofenac and metamizol (dipyrone) elevated the heat threshold of mice with minimum effective doses of 6, 30 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg i.p., respectively. These doses of morphine and diclofenac failed to induce any remarkable effect on psychomotor activity in the open field test while that of metamizol exerted a profound inhibition. The anxiolytic diazepam and the neuroleptic droperidol at doses evoking a mild and moderate, respectively, psychomotor inhibition failed to alter the heat threshold. Combination of a subliminal dose of morphine (regarding both antinociceptive and psychomotor inhibitory action) with diclofenac, metamizol, diazepam or droperidol at doses also subliminal regarding the thermal antinociceptive effect elevated the noxious heat threshold without major additional effects in the open field test. It is concluded that the increasing-temperature water bath is suitable for studying the thermal antinociceptive effects of morphine and diclofenac as well as the morphine-sparing action of diclofenac, metamizol, droperidol and diazepam. Behavioural testing is recommended when testing analgesics.", 
    "162": "Acute pancreatitis is a lethal inflammatory condition of pancreas with high mortality rate. There is a pressing need for research to explore active agents and novel mechanisms involving in the treatment of pancreatitis. Clinical studies have shown after the initial acinar cell injury plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in patients with acute pancreatitis and the degree of cytokine elevation correlates with disease severity. Diazepam may decrease interleukin release from macrophages, suppress neutrophil activities, and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. So it is expected that in vivo pretreatment of acute pancreatitis with different doses of diazepam can attenuate its severity. Thus, we evaluated the effects of diazepam, intraperitoneally (5, 10, and 20\u2009mg/kg i.p.), intracerebroventricularly (ICV 10\u2009 \u03bc g), and concurrently with flumazenil (1\u2009mg/kg) on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice. Interestingly, the pretreatment with diazepam (5\u2009mg/kg i.p.) reduced significantly the inflammatory response of acute pancreatitis by ameliorating pancreatic edema, amylase and lipase serum levels, myeloperoxidase activity, pancreatic TNF-alpha, and pathological alteration compared to control group. Diazepam i.c.v. was ineffective, suggesting that central benzodiazepine receptors have no significant role in this property. These results demonstrate that pretreatment with diazepam exhibits anti-inflammatory property in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis possibly through peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "163": "Wogonin is a flavonoid compound extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis and is well known as a benzodiazepine receptor ligand with anxiolytic effects. Many recent studies have demonstrated that wogonin modulates angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and tumor progress in various cancer tissues. We further explored the mechanism of action of wogonin on cervical cancer cells that contain or lack human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. Wogonin was cytotoxic to HPV 16 (+) cervical cancer cells, SiHa and CaSki, but not to HPV-negative cells. We demonstrated that wogonin induced apoptosis by suppressing the expressions of the E6 and E7 viral oncogenes in HPV-infected cervical cancer CaSki and SiHa cells. The modulation of p53 and protein retinoblastoma (pRb) were also triggered by the suppression of E6 and E7 expressions. However, p53 was not altered in HPV-negative cervical cancer C33A cells. Moreover, wogonin modulated the mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors such as Bax and Bcl-2. Wogonin also provoked the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly ADP ribose polymerase. After transfection of siRNAs to target E6 and E7, additional restoration of p53 and pRb was not induced, but processing of caspases and PARP was increased compared with wogonin treatment alone. Together, our findings demonstrated that wogonin effectively promotes apoptosis by downregulating E6 and E7 expressions and promoting intrinsic apoptosis in human cervical cancer cells.", 
    "164": "Among several commonly used atypical antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine and risperidone cause a sensitization effect in the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotion paradigms--two well established animal tests of antipsychotic drugs, whereas clozapine causes a tolerance effect. Asenapine is a novel antipsychotic drug recently approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic disorders. It shares several receptor binding sites and behavioral features with other atypical antipsychotic drugs. However, it is not clear what type of repeated effect (sensitization or tolerance) asenapine would induce, and whether such an effect is transferrable to other atypicals. In this study, male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were first repeatedly tested with asenapine (0.05, 0.10 or 0.20 mg/kg, sc) for avoidance response or PCP (3.20 mg/kg, sc)-induced hyperlocomotion daily for 5 consecutive days. After 2-3 days of retraining/drug-free recovery, they were then challenged with asenapine (0.10 mg/kg, sc), followed by olanzapine (0.50 mg/kg, sc) and clozapine (2.50 mg/kg, sc). During the 5-day drug test period (the induction phase), repeated asenapine treatment progressively increased its inhibition of avoidance response and PCP-induced hyperlocomotion in a dose-dependent fashion. On the asenapine and olanzapine challenge tests (the expression phase), rats previously treated with asenapine still showed significantly lower avoidance response and lower PCP-induced hyperlocomotion than those previously treated with vehicle. An increased reactivity to clozapine challenge in prior asenapine-treated rats was also found in the PCP-induced hyperlocomotion test. These findings suggest that asenapine is capable of inducing a sensitization effect and a cross-sensitization to olanzapine and clozapine (to a lesser extent). Because the behavioral profile of asenapine in both tests is similar to that of olanzapine, but different from that of clozapine, we suggest that asenapine resembles olanzapine to a greater extent than clozapine in its therapeutic and side effect profiles.", 
    "165": "P2X7, an ATP-gated cation channel, is involved in immune cell activation, hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain. By regulating cytokine release in the brain, P2X7 has been linked to the pathophysiology of mood disorders and schizophrenia. We here assess the impact of 123 drugs that act in the central nervous system on human P2X7. Most prominently, the tricyclic antipsychotics prochlorperazine (PCP) and trifluoperazine (TFP) potently inhibited P2X7-mediated Ca2+ entry, dye permeation and ionic currents. In divalent cation-containing bath solutions or after prolonged incubation, ATP-evoked P2X7 currents were inhibited by 10 \u03bcM PCP. This effect was not related to dopamine receptor antagonism. Surprisingly, PCP co-applied with ATP enhanced inward currents in bath solutions with low divalent cation concentrations. Intracellular perfusion with PCP did not substitute for the extracellularly applied drug, indicating that its binding sites are accessible from the extracellular space. Since P2X7 current potentiation by PCP was voltage-dependent, at least one site may be located within the electrical field of the membrane. While the channel opening and closure kinetic was altered by PCP, the apparent affinity of ATP remained unchanged (potentiation) or changed slightly (inhibition). Measurements in human monocyte-derived macrophages confirmed the PCP-induced inhibition of ATP-evoked Ca2+ influx, Yo-Pro-1 permeability, and whole cell currents. Interestingly, neither heterologously expressed rat or mouse P2X7 nor native P2X7 in rat astrocyte cultures or in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were inhibited by perazines with a similar potency. We conclude that perazine-type neuroleptics are potent, but species-selective allosteric modulators of human but not murine P2X7 receptors.",

This sustained hiccup had severely restricted the patient's ability to intake food and sleep. To explore alternative treatments, we investigated the adjuvant administration of lansoprazole, dimenhydrinate and clonazepam in this patient. We discovered that this drug combination was capable of successfully terminating his intractable hiccups, with no further evidence of recurrence. No similar treatment is previously reported for intractable hiccups. We further suggest a hypothesis concerning a potential mechanism on the anti-hiccup effect of dimenhydrinate.",

Metabolic side-effects, including glucose intolerance, can be accurately modelled in rodents. The benefits of interventions used for treating metabolic side-effects of SGAs are mostly unknown. In a 9\u00a0wk longitudinal study, female rats were given daily olanzapine (10\u00a0mg/kg s.c.) or vehicle. Animals were either sedentary or allowed 1 or 3\u00a0h daily access to a running wheel, with total wheel revolutions electronically quantified to reflect exercise intensity. Glucose tolerance tests were performed once weekly to measure glycemic control. Drug levels were measured at week 4. At week 9, abdominal fat and skeletal muscle levels of Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT4) were measured. Exercise intensity progressively increased over time in all groups given access to running wheels; however, rats treated with olanzapine consistently exercised less than those given the vehicle. Olanzapine caused acute and persistent glucose intolerance throughout the study, which was markedly, though incompletely, ameliorated by exercise. Exercise did not affect glycemic regulation in vehicle-treated rats. Olanzapine-treated rats showed greater central adiposity. Levels of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle were higher in both groups of exercising than in sedentary rats, and GLUT4 values were negatively correlated with glucose intolerance. Routine exercise reduced olanzapine-induced glucose intolerance and increased skeletal muscle levels of GLUT 4, the insulin-responsive transporter that mediates glucose uptake into cells. The current animal model is suitable for evaluating physiological pathways involved with glucose intolerance.",

Despite a number of TSPO ligands whose effects have been studied with respect to these varied biological activities, the nature of their interactions with TSPO and the molecular mechanism of their effects remain controversial, in part because of the lack of an atomic-resolution structure. We expressed and purified the homologue of mammalian TSPO from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsTSPO), as well as a mutant form in a proposed drug binding loop, RsTSPOW38C. We characterized their binding behaviors with endogenous ligands and a series of compounds that affect apoptosis by using a sensitive tryptophan fluorescence quenching assay. Our results show that RsTSPO behaves as a dimer in the purified state and binds with low micromolar affinity to many of these ligands, including retinoic acid, curcumin, and a known Bcl-2 inhibitor, gossypol, suggesting a possible direct role for TSPO in their regulation of apoptosis. A computational model of the RsTSPO dimer is constructed using EM-Fold, Rosetta, and a cryo-electron microscopy density map.

Midazolam, a fast-acting benzodiazepine, is now authorised for use in this setting, in the form of a solution for oral transmucosal route. The results of five trials conducted in specialised centres suggest that midazolam oromucosal solution is at least as effective as rectal diazepam in reducing the duration of seizures and preventing early seizure recurrence. However, the evidence provided by these studies is weak. The main adverse effects of midazolam oromucosal solution are the same as those of rectal diazepam; in particular, respiratory depression occurs in 1% to 5% of patients and can necessitate intubation. Some anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital, may reduce the effectiveness of midazolam and diazepam. At the recommended doses, midazolam overdose may occur when the oromucosal solution is used to treat infants less than 6 months old. Midazolam oromucosal solution is sold in single-dose ready-to-use oral syringes. In France, diazepam doses for rectal administration must be prepared from a vial of solution. In early 2013, the usability of oral transmucosal versus rectal administration has not been compared prospectively in children with convulsive seizures. In practice, rectal diazepam is the drug of choice for paediatric convulsive seizures occurring outside the hospital setting.

PCI is calculated by (i) perturbing the cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to engage distributed interactions in the brain (integration) and (ii) compressing the spatiotemporal pattern of these electrocortical responses to measure their algorithmic complexity (information). We test PCI on a large data set of TMS-evoked potentials recorded in healthy subjects during wakefulness, dreaming, nonrapid eye movement sleep, and different levels of sedation induced by anesthetic agents (midazolam, xenon, and propofol), as well as in patients who had emerged from coma (vegetative state, minimally conscious state, and locked-in syndrome). PCI reliably discriminated the level of consciousness in single individuals during wakefulness, sleep, and anesthesia, as well as in patients who had emerged from coma and recovered a minimal level of consciousness. PCI can potentially be used for objective determination of the level of consciousness at the bedside.", 
    "219": "Intranasal dexmedetomidine is noninvasive and has been reported as premedication for children undergoing surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intranasal dexmedetomidine during electrochemotherapy for facial vascular malformation under local anesthesia.", 
    "220": "A placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was designed. Patients with facial vascular malformation scheduled for electrochemotherapy under local anesthesia were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (group IN, IV, or C). Patients in group IN received dexmedetomidine 1 \u03bcg/kg intranasally. Patients in group IV received dexmedetomidine 1 \u03bcg/kg intravenously. Patients in group C received 0.9% saline intranasally and intravenously. Sedation status and vital signs were assessed at baseline, 15 and 30 minutes after drug administration, before surgery, and 15 minutes after the start of surgery. Midazolam was used as a rescue. Data were analyzed by 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance.", 
    "221": "Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were enrolled. Patients in groups IN and IV were significantly more sedated than those in group C before the beginning of surgery (P < .001 for the 2 comparisons). After nasal administration, adequate sedation was achieved within 30 to 45 minutes. In group IV, the onset of sedation was 15 to 20 minutes. There were no clinically significant adverse effects.", 
    "222": "Intranasal dexmedetomidine has a sedative effect under local anesthesia and offers a noninvasive, better-tolerated alternative to intravenous administration.", 
    "223": "Most studies on benzodiazepines emphasize overconsumption and warn of addiction, especially by older adults. This article is about the avoidance of benzodiazepine medications by 'aging' women living in a Brazilian village. This case study helps to support our central concern: to call attention to the ambiguities that exist in discussing these medications, and to stress the importance of a multilayered understanding of effect. We argue that benzodiazepines, like other psychopharmaka, induce bodily sensations that, at least in part, correspond to and are shaped by the situated self-image of individuals in distress.", 
    "224": "Male Hartley guinea pigs and male rhesus macaques were used to determine an efficacious dose of 1,1'-methylenebis{4-[(hydroxyimino)methyl] pyridinium} dimethanesulfonate (MMB4 DMS) that would result in 80% survival, 24 hours following a single exposure to cyclosarin (GF). The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship between acetylcholinesterase activity and MMB4 plasma concentrations relative to survival was evaluated. Guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs) were concurrently administered MMB4 DMS (guinea pigs: 0, 10, 30, or 40 mg/kg, intramuscular [IM] and NHPs: 0.1, 1, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, IM), atropine, and diazepam following a 3 \u00d7 median lethal dose (LD50) GF challenge. Clinical observations were evaluated using a quality-of-life (QOL) scoring system. All GF-exposed animals exhibited typical signs of nerve agent poisoning immediately following challenge. In guinea pigs, 24-hour survival was 0%, 50%, 90%, and 90% for 0, 10, 30, and 40 mg/kg MMB4 DMS groups, respectively. In addition, nearly all animals surviving to 24 hours were clinically normal, with many in the 30 and 40 mg/kg MMB4 DMS dose group observed as normal by 4 hours post-challenge. In NHPs, survival was 100% for all treatment groups, with all animals noted as clinically normal by 48 hours. Following treatment with atropine/MMB4 DMS/diazepam, NHPs exhibited dose- and temporal-related decreases in incidence and duration of the clinical signs of toxicity. The QOL scores improved with increasing MMB4 DMS dose in both species. The estimated ED80s were 25.5 mg/kg MMB4 DMS (human equivalent dose [HED] of 5.5 mg/kg) and \u2264 0.1 mg/kg (HED of 0.03 mg/kg) in guinea pigs and NHPs, respectively.", 
    "225": "During functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), intraoperative bleeding can significantly compromise visualization of the surgical field. Clonidine constricts peripheral blood vessels and reduces systemic blood pressure, which in combination decrease nasal mucosa blood flow. This dual effect can potentially reduce bleeding during FESS and stabilize the intraoperative hemodynamic profile of the patient.", 
    "226": "The aim of this prospective study was to assess if the quality of the surgical field visualization during FESS was improved when clonidine was used as a premedication agent.", 
    "227": "A group of 44 patients undergoing FESS for chronic sinusitis and polyp removal were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either oral clonidine or midazolam as preoperative premedication. During the operation, the quality of the surgical field was assessed and graded by the operating surgeon using the scale proposed by Boezaart. The evaluations were done during surgery at 15 minutes (K1), 30 minutes (K2), 60 minutes (K3) and 120 minutes (K4) after incision.", 
    "228": "The duration of the surgical procedure was significantly shorter in the clonidine group: mean time of surgery: 80 vs. 96 min in the clonidine and midazolam groups, respectively. Also better quality of surgical field was observed at all time points in the clonidine group.", 
    "229": "Premedication with clonidine before FESS results in shortening of the surgical time and a better quality of the surgical field.", 
    "230": "A short-cut review was carried out to determine whether intranasal lorazepam was as effective as intravenous lorazepam in the control of seizures in children. Eighteen papers were found using the reported search, of which one was directly relevant and another compared intranasal lorazepam with intramuscular paraldehyde. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses are shown in table 1. It is concluded that intranasal lorazepam appears to be a safe and effective treatment for this condition."
