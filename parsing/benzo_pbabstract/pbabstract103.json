The GABA system is the major inhibitory system in the adult CNS and most positive modulators of the GABA-A receptor (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol, GABA steroids), induce inhibitory (e.g. anesthetic, sedative, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic) effects. However, some individuals have adverse effects (seizures, increased pain, anxiety, irritability, aggression) upon exposure. Positive GABA-A receptor modulators induce strong paradoxical effects including negative mood in 3%-8% of those exposed, while up to 25% have moderate symptoms. The effect is biphasic: low concentrations induce an adverse anxiogenic effect while higher concentrations decrease this effect and show inhibitory, calming properties. The prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is also 3%-8% among women in fertile ages, and up to 25% have more moderate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Patients with PMDD have severe luteal phase-related symptoms and show changes in GABA-A receptor sensitivity and GABA concentrations. Findings suggest that negative mood symptoms in women with PMDD are caused by the paradoxical effect of allopregnanolone mediated via the GABA-A receptor, which may be explained by one or more of three hypotheses regarding the paradoxical effect of GABA steroids on behavior: (1) under certain conditions, such as puberty, the relative fraction of certain GABA-A receptor subtypes may be altered, and at those subtypes the GABA steroids may act as negative modulators in contrast to their usual role as positive modulators; (2) in certain brain areas of vulnerable women the transmembrane Cl(-) gradient may be altered by factors such as estrogens that favor excitability; (3) inhibition of inhibitory neurons may promote disinhibition, and hence excitability.

    "1": "Cholesterol transport across the mitochondrial membrane is rate-limiting for steroidogenesis in vertebrates. Previous studies in fish have characterized expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, however the function and regulation of other genes and proteins involved in piscine cholesterol transport have not been evaluated. In the current study, mRNA sequences of the 18 kDa translocator protein (tspo; formerly peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), voltage-dependent anion channel (vdac), and diazepam binding inhibitor (dbi; also acyl-CoA binding protein) were cloned from largemouth bass. Gonadal expression was examined across reproductive stages to determine if expression is correlated with changes in steroid levels and with indicators of reproductive maturation. In testis, transcript abundance of tspo and dbi increased with reproductive maturation (6- and 23-fold maximal increase, respectively) and expression of tspo and dbi was positively correlated with reproductive stage, gonadosomatic index (GSI), and circulating levels of testosterone. Testis vdac expression was positively correlated with reproductive stage and GSI. In females, gonadal tspo and vdac expression was negatively correlated with GSI and levels of plasma testosterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol. Ovarian dbi expression was not correlated with indicators of reproductive maturation. These studies represent the first investigation of the steroidogenic role of tspo, vdac, and dbi in fish. Findings suggest that cholesterol transport in largemouth bass testis, but not in ovary, may be transcriptionally-regulated, however further investigation will be necessary to fully elucidate the role of these genes in largemouth bass steroidogenesis.",

    "3": "95 patients undergoing choledochofiberscopic dilatation of bile duct were reviewed, 43 of which were dealt with remifentanil-propofol (PR) and 52 with remifentanil-midazolam (MR). After medication, changes of HR, MAP, RR and SPO(2) were observed. The effects of sedation and analgesia, the instance of amnesia, and side effects were recorded.", 
    "4": "HR in group PR and MR were increase at 10 to 20 min and 20 min respectively after medication. MAP in group PR was increased at 20 min, which were decreased in group MR (P < 0.05). Compared with group PR, group MR achieved similar analgesia (P > 0.05), more moderate sedation with modified OAA/S score of 3 - 4 (67% vs 28%, P < 0.01), less memory, less injection pain, and higher satisfaction (P < 0.05).", 
    "5": "Both remifentanil-propofol and remifentanil-midazolam can provide safe and effective sedation and analgesia for choledochofiberscopic dilatation of bile duct. Remifentanil-midazolam provides more stable hemodynamics, more amnesia, moderate sedation duration and less side effects.", 
    "6": "Emotional impairments constitute a crucial and widely described dimension of alcoholism, but several affective abilities are still to be thoroughly explored among alcohol-dependent patients. This is particularly true for empathy, which constitutes an essential emotional competence for interpersonal relations and has been shown to be highly impaired in various psychiatric states. The present study aimed at exploring empathic abilities in alcoholism, and notably the hypothesis of a differential deficit between emotional and cognitive empathy.", 
    "7": "Empathy abilities were evaluated among 30 recently detoxified inpatients diagnosed with alcohol dependence and 30 paired healthy controls, using highly validated questionnaires (Interpersonal Reactivity Index [J Pers Soc Psychol44:113] and Empathy Quotient [J Autism Dev Disord34:163]). Correlational analyses were performed to evaluate the links between empathy scores and psychopathological measures (i.e., depression, anxiety, interpersonal problems, and alexithymia).", 
    "8": "When psychiatric comorbities are controlled for, alcoholism is not associated with a general empathy deficit, but rather with a dissociated pattern combining impaired emotional empathy and preserved cognitive one. Moreover, this emotional empathy deficit is not associated with depression or anxiety scores, but is negatively correlated with alexithymia and the severity of interpersonal problems.", 
    "9": "At the theoretical level, this first observation of a specific deficit for emotional empathy in alcoholism, combined with the exact inverse pattern observed in other psychiatric populations, leads to a double-dissociation, which supports the notion that emotional and cognitive empathy are 2 distinct abilities. At the clinical level, this deficit calls for considering emotional empathy rehabilitation as a crucial concern in psychotherapy.",

This re-scanning attempt was made 2 or more days prior to a scheduled anesthesia-assisted MRI appointment. If the patient successfully completed the wide bore MRI examination then the anesthesia-assisted MRI appointment was canceled.", 
    "12": "A total of 56 patients were included in this study. The examinations included individual body regions as well as combination examinations (head and cervical spine, entire spine etc.). A total of 72 body regions were examined in 56 patients. Of these regions, 65 (90%) were completed successfully, 50 patients (89%) successfully completed a diagnostic examination on the 70\u00a0cm scanner and 6 patients (11%), all of whom were scheduled for examinations which included the head, were unable to complete the examination on the wide bore scanner.",

There is limited evidence on whether this loading dose will achieve the desired levels in paediatric patients. Intravenous loading doses of phenytoin were retrospectively and prospectively audited over 19 months. Doses were normalised for weight and compared with the serum phenytoin concentrations. Errors in dose calculations and adverse events were recorded. Serum phenytoin concentrations were measured on 31 occasions in 27 children (24 retrospective and 10 prospective) between 60 and 180 (median, 153) min after completion of the loading dose. Serum phenytoin concentrations were within the therapeutic range (10-20 \u03bcg/ml) on 24 occasions. No errors in dose calculations or adverse effects were identified. A phenytoin loading dose of 18 mg/kg gave serum concentrations within the recommended therapeutic range in most children.",

The study group comprised 21 outpatients (4 by generalized, 17 by localization-related) aged between 9 months and 17 years. Ethyl loflazepate was administered at a dose of 0.015 mg/kg/day twice daily. The final mean dose was 1.35 mg/day. The mean number of prior antiepileptic drugs was 5.7. The entire treatment period was more than 24 months after ethyl loflazepate administration. Six children (28.6%) became seizure-free for the entire study 6 months after administration, 11 (52.4%) had a seizure reduction of more than 50% for over entire 24 months. The mean number of co-medications was 2.4. Adverse events occurred in only 1 patient. Responders, defined as reduction of \u226550% in seizure frequency, included 2/2 of patients with West syndrome and 15/17 (88.2%) with localization-related epilepsy. Ethyl loflazepate represents an important addition to the treatments available for refractory epilepsies in children.", 
    "16": "Myopia is the most common human eye disorder. With its increasing prevalence and earlier age-of-onset in recent birth cohorts, myopia now affects almost 33% of adults in the United States, and epidemic proportions of 85% to 90% adults in Asian cities. Unlike children in Western populations, where the prevalence of myopia is very low (less than 5%), Asian children have prevalences as high as 29% in 7-year-olds. In addition to the direct economic and social burdens of myopia, associated ocular complications may lead to substantial vision loss. This workshop summarizes the current literature regarding myopia epidemiology, genetics, animal model studies, risk factors, and clinical treatments. Published treatment strategies to retard the progression of myopia in children, such as pharmacologic agents, progressive addition lenses, and neural adaptation programs, are outlined.",

All patients received 0.08 mg.kg(-1) of intravenous midazolam 10 minutes before administration of ketamine S(+). In each group, two moments were evaluated: M1, before ketamine S(+) administration; and M2, after ketamine S(+) administration. Sedation levels and encephalographic variables: BIS, SEF 95%, pEMG, suppression rate, and the presence of burst-suppression were evaluated in all patients before and after ketamine S(+) administration. ANOVA was used for repeated measurements and the p-value was adjusted for multiple comparisons by Tukey's test.",

    "21": "Benzodiazepines (BZD) misuse is a serious public health problem, especially among opiate-dependent patients with anxiety enrolled in methadone program because it puts patients at higher risk of life-threatening multiple drug overdoses. Both elevated anxiety and BZD misuse increase the risk for ex-addicts to relapse. However, there is no recent study to assess how serious the problem is and what factors are associated with BZD misuse. This study estimates the prevalence of BZD misuse in a methadone program, and provides information on the characteristics of BZD users compared to non-users.",

    "23": "47% of the respondents had a history of BZD use, and 39.8% used BZD without a prescription. Half of the BZD users (54%) started using BZD after entering the methadone program, and 61% of previous BZD users reported increased or resumed use after entering methadone program. Compared to the non-users, BZD users were more likely to be White, have prescribed medication for mental problems, have preexistent anxiety problems before opiate use, and had anxiety problems before entering methadone program. They reported more mental health problems in the past month, and had higher scores in anxiety state, depression and perceived stress (p < .05).", 
    "24": "Important information on epidemiology of BZD misuse among methadone-maintenance patients suggests that most methadone programs do not address co-occurring anxiety problems, and methadone treatment may trigger onset or worsening of BZD misuse. Further study is needed to explore how to curb misuse and abuse of BZD in the addiction population, and provide effective treatments targeting simultaneously addiction symptoms, anxiety disorders and BZD misuse.",

Oligoclonal IgG band was positive. Her symptoms were improved by intravenous methylprednisolone and an antiepileptic drug (MEPM 1 g/day and CZP 1 mg/day). The head tremor was the so-called \"yes-yes\" type which shakes back and forth. Although this type of tremor has been considered to be developed by the lesions in the cerebellum, our patient seemed to develop the tremor by cervical cord lesion. Further investigation is needed to confirm the association of the head tremor and the cervical lesions in MS.", 
    "26": "A sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric method was developed for the quantification of ipriflavone in human plasma. The method utilized liquid-liquid extraction of plasma with ethyl acetate. A gradient elution was performed on a Hedera ODS-2 column (150\u00d72.1 mm i.d., 5 \u00b5m), using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid solution and methanol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The single quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in selected-ion monitoring mode via positive electrospray ionization interface detecting m/z 239.1 and 285.1 for ipriflavone and diazepam (the internal standard), respectively. To improve the selectivity and sensitivity, the fragment ion m/z 239.1, which was produced by in-source collision-induced dissociation, was chosen as the quantitative ion for ipriflavone. The method was fully validated and applied to a pharmacokinetic study of ipriflavone. After oral administration of a single 200 mg ipriflavone tablet, the C(max,) AUC(0-72 h) , t(1/2) and T(max) were 6.3\u00b16.3 ng/mL, 80.0\u00b169.1 \u00b5g h/L, 23.0\u00b18.6 h and 3.4\u00b12.1 h, respectively.",

    "32": "A previously healthy 8-year-old male presented with cognitive regression, sleep disturbance, hallucinations, and severe attacks of agitation and oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were detected 2 months after onset of symptoms. Bursts of agitation were initially considered to be epileptic leading to the administration of a high dose of benzodiazepines. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) failed to disclose any correlation between the episodes of agitation and paroxysmal rhythmic slow activity on EEG persisting throughout and after attacks of agitation. Clinical improvement and EEG normalization followed an initial plasma exchange performed 3 months after onset of disease. This particular paroxysmal EEG pattern in NMDAR antibody encephalitis suggests that it may result from the combination of reduced NMDAR function and major \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic activation.", 
    "33": "We report the case of an adolescent male who presented with mutism, immobility, catalepsy, and mannerisms. The patient was admitted to our hospital with suspected catatonic schizophrenia; however, he was subsequently diagnosed with catatonia due to Asperger's disorder. The patient was a 16-year-old male. More than six months before presentation, his grandfather displayed bizarre and violent behavior. Subsequently, he began to experience catatonia, which eventually led to hospitalization. Treatment with diazepam improved his condition and, as no causal disorders other than Asperger's disorder were identified, he was diagnosed with catatonia. The patient had experienced persistent abuse by his mother during childhood; therefore, it is important to consider reactive attachment disorder (DSM-IV-TR) as a differential diagnosis. Among child and adolescent psychiatrists, catatonia is considered to occur at a high frequency among patients with autistic spectrum disorders. In contrast, general psychiatrists tend to consider catatonia as related to schizophrenia, which may be the reason why the diagnosis of our patient was difficult. We assume that the pathogenesis of catatonia in this case was death mimicry due to the subjective perception of a life-threatening situation. For the treatment of catatonia with autistic spectrum disorders, the efficacy of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy has been established. When a patient with an autistic spectrum disorder presents with motor functional disturbances, it is important to consider these disturbances as catatonia. Furthermore, it is also important to begin the treatment mentioned above even in the presence of definite psychogenic or situational factors.", 
    "34": "We report about a woman of 60 years who received psychiatric inpatient treatment for an affective disorder with psychotic symptoms on several occasions. As time elapsed symptoms of dementia became more and more obvious. Despite a comprehensive workup with neuroimaging methods (SPECT, PET) the correct diagnosis of Huntington's Chorea was not attained until the characteristic movements appeared. Up till then pathologic movements had hardly occurred and there were no known cases of Huntington's Chorea in the family. This case is remarkable as the patient was not only treated with different antidepressants and antipsychotics but with a course of ECT too. Beyond this it shows the enormous stress this illness imposes on patients and their caregivers.",

However, clinicians should be vigilant and wary when interpreting results, weighing all factors involved in their decision.", 
    "43": "Catatonia is a syndrome of physical and behavioral abnormalities that can result from psychiatric, neurological, or medical illness. Although systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is commonly known to cause neurological and psychiatric manifestations, it has only rarely been reported to cause the catatonic syndrome. In nearly all previously reported cases, the diagnosis of catatonia was reported in patients with an established diagnosis of lupus. We report a case in which a woman with no known medical history presented with catatonia that did not respond to standard treatment with benzodiazepines, suffered a long and complicated hospital course, and was eventually diagnosed with lupus. With initiation of treatment for lupus, her symptoms of catatonia remitted. This case illustrates the importance of considering medical causes in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders, especially the catatonic syndrome.", 
    "44": "Agitation among psychiatric inpatients (particularly those diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) is common and, unless recognized early and managed effectively, can rapidly escalate to potentially dangerous behaviors, including physical violence. Inpatient aggression and violence have substantial adverse psychological and physical consequences for both patients and providers, and they are costly to the healthcare system. In contrast to the commonly held view that inpatient violence occurs without warning or can be predicted by \"static\" risk factors, such as patient demographics or clinical characteristics, research indicates that violence is usually preceded by observable behaviors, especially non-violent agitation. When agitation is recognized, staff should employ nonpharmacological de-escalation strategies and, if the behavior continues, offer pharmacological treatment to calm patients rapidly. Given the poor therapeutic efficacy and potential for adverse events associated with physical restraint and seclusion, and the potential adverse sequelae of involuntary drug treatment, these interventions should be considered last resorts. Pharmacological agents used to treat agitation include benzodiazepines and first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Although no currently available agent is ideal, recommendations for selecting among them are provided. There remains an unmet need for a non-invasive and rapidly acting agent that effectively calms without excessively sedating patients, addresses the patient's underlying psychiatric symptoms, and is reasonably safe and tolerable. A treatment with these characteristics could substantially reduce the clinical and economic burden of agitation in the inpatient psychiatric setting.", 
    "45": "We report a case with bipolar II disorder having mixed features, in which refractory insomnia persisted. We diagnosed his case as mixed depression with mood fluctuations because increased impulsivity and buying sprees became remarkable, with diminished ability to think or concentrate. Switching to carbamazepine and risperidone improved his mood fluctuations and impulsivity. Nevertheless, his intermittent awakening (fragmentation of the sleep-wake rhythm), related dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety about sleep, and mild impulsivity persisted. The addition of various benzodiazepine sleeping drugs, bromovalerylurea, and antipsychotics did not improve insomnia. His intractable insomnia was markedly responsive to gabapentin, engendering further improvement of mood symptoms. Eventually, its efficacy achieved his reinstatement at work. Results of this case suggest the clinical use of gabapentin for treating bipolar disorder, especially in cases with intractable insomnia, which is a very important point in the symptoms and therapeutics of bipolar disorder.",

We set out to better understand the change in productivity level among chronically ill patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine compared with other antipsychotic medications. We also assessed the links between productivity level and other clinical outcomes.",

In the present study, the human risk of hepatomegaly was assessed and the causative mechanism in terms of cell proliferation and apoptosis, oxidative stress, and drug-metabolizing enzyme induction was elucidated by toxicological approach. Male SD rats were treated orally with 400 mg/kg CLB for 1, 3, 7, 14, or 28 days. The 28-day treatment was followed by 7 or 14 days of withdrawal. At the end of each treatment, the liver and plasma of each rat were examined. Liver weight increased from Day 3 of CLB treatment. This increase was mostly accompanied by hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy and proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and by an increase in microsomal proteins. Cyp2b1, Cyp3a1, Cyp3a2, and Ugt2b2 mRNA levels in the liver were upregulated as compared to the control group throughout the dosing period. On the other hand, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) formulation, hepatocyte proliferation, and apoptosis, assumed to play roles in laying groundwork for effective induction of metabolizing enzymes, were increased only at the acute phase of treatment. These results suggested that CLB-induced hepatomegaly in male rats is mainly attributable to microsomal enzyme induction associated with Cyp2b1, Cyp3a1, Cyp3a2, and Ugt2b2 gene upregulation, but does not cause any toxicological concerns.",

Several anxiety behaviors have been characterized in zebrafish, but the effect of anxiolytic drugs on these parameters has been scarcely studied. The purpose of this work was to assess the predictive validity of acute treatment with anxiolytic drugs on behavioral parameters of anxiety. In the first task we simultaneously observed behavior of adult zebrafish on four parameters: height in the tank, locomotion, color, and shoal cohesion. The second task was the assessment of light/dark preference for 5 min. The benzodiazepines clonazepam, bromazepam, diazepam, and a moderate dose of ethanol significantly reduced shoal cohesion. Buspirone specifically increased zebrafish exploration of higher portions of the tank. In the light/dark task, all benzodiazepines, buspirone, and ethanol increased time spent in the light compartment. After treatment with anxiolytics, fish typically spent more than 60s and rarely less than 40s in the light compartment whereas controls (n=45) spent 33.3\u00b114.4s and always less than 60s in the light compartment. Propranolol had no clear effects in these tasks. These results suggest that light/dark preference in zebrafish is a practical, low-cost, and sensitive screening task for anxiolytic drugs.

This paper describes the discovery and molecular characterization of potent (nM) small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the function of the BET family of bromodomains (Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4). By using a combination of phenotypic screening, chemoproteomics, and biophysical studies, we have discovered that the protein-protein interactions between bromodomains and acetylated histones can be antagonized by selective small molecules that bind at the acetylated lysine recognition pocket.

    "117": "Sleepwalking is a frequently reported side effect of zolpidem which is a short-acting hypnotic drug potentiating activity of GABA(A) receptors. Paradoxically, the most commonly used medications for somnambulism are benzodiazepines, especially clonazepam, which also potentiate activity of GABA(A) receptors. It is proposed that zolpidem-induced sleepwalking can be explained by the desensitization of GABAergic receptors located on serotonergic neurons. According to the proposed model, the delay between desensitization of GABA receptors and a compensatory decrease in serotonin release constitutes the time window for parasomnias. The occurrence of sleepwalking depends on individual differences in receptor desensitization, autoregulation of serotonin release and drug pharmacokinetics. The proposed mechanism of interaction between GABAergic and serotonergic systems can be also relevant for zolpidem abuse and zolpidem-induced hallucinations. It is therefore suggested that special care should be taken when zolpidem is used in patients taking at the same time selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",

    "136": "HIV infection may result in stressful situations such as disclosure to others and could be a mediator between seropositivity status and psychiatric illness, depression, or anxiety. Several results have shown that anxiolytic use (mainly benzodiazepines [BDZ]) is highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals, but few studies have highlighted to what extent this use could be associated with HIV disclosure. A national cross-sectional survey representative of people living with HIV and AIDS in France enrolled 2932 individuals in 102 French HIV hospital departments. Face-to-face interviews and self-administered questions collected information about patients' experience with HIV and HIV care, including use of psychotropic drugs, social support, stigma, and disclosure of HIV status. We identified factors associated with regular BDZ use (i.e., more than once a week) using a weighted logistic regression model. Regular BDZ use and anxiety symptoms were reported by 16% and 29% of the patients, respectively. After multiple adjustment for known correlates of BDZ use and anxiety symptoms, individuals who had disclosed their HIV status to relatives or friends were found to be more likely (OR [95% CI] = 1.78 [1.02-3.09]) to regularly use BDZ. These results show both to what extent disclosure to others continues to be a stressful step in the course of HIV infection and that disclosure is something that could be identified by BDZ use. They also highlight the need for appropriate case management and psychiatric care to help patients manage the consequences of disclosure.",

Both ALF single-point plasma concentrations and miosis are surrogates for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and clearance and are minimal and noninvasive CYP3A probes. This investigation determined ALF sensitivity for detecting graded CYP3A induction and compared it with that of midazolam (MDZ). Twelve volunteers (sequential crossover) received 0, 5, 10, 25, or 75 mg oral rifampin for 5 days. MDZ and ALF were given intravenously and orally on sequential days. Dark-adapted pupil diameter was measured with blood sampling. Graded rifampin decreased plasma MDZ AUCs to 83, 76, 62, and 59% (intravenous (i.v.)) and 78, 66, 39, and 24% (oral) of control.

    "138": "We have shown previously that aberrant hippocampal (HPC) output underlies the dopamine (DA) dysfunction observed in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) developmental model of schizophrenia in the rodent. This alteration of HPC activity was proposed to result from a reduction in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons and consequent destabilization of the output of pyramidal neurons, as well as disrupted activation across a broad neural network. In vivo extracellular recordings were performed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral HPC of saline- (SAL) and MAM-treated animals. A novel benzodiazepine-positive allosteric modulator (PAM), selective for the \u03b15 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, SH-053-2'F-R-CH3, was tested for its effects on the output of the HPC, leading to dopamine system hyperactivity in MAM-treated animals. In addition, the effect of SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 on the hyperactive locomotor response to amphetamine in MAM animals was examined. We demonstrate that treatment with the \u03b15GABA(A)R PAM reduced the number of spontaneously active DA neurons in the VTA of MAM animals to levels observed in SAL rats, both when administered systemically and when directly infused into the ventral HPC. Moreover, HPC neurons in both SAL and MAM animals showed diminished cortical-evoked responses following \u03b15GABA(A)R PAM treatment. In addition, the increased locomotor response to amphetamine observed in MAM rats was reduced following \u03b15GABA(A)R treatment. This study supports a novel treatment of schizophrenia that targets abnormal HPC output, which in turn normalizes dopaminergic neuronal activity.", 
    "139": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a neurological disease characterized by loss of normal REM motor inhibition and subsequent dream enactment. RBD is clinically relevant because it predicts neurodegenerative disease onset (e.g., Parkinson's disease) and is clinically problematic because it disrupts sleep and results in patient injuries and hospitalization. Even though the cause of RBD is unknown, multiple lines of evidence indicate that abnormal inhibitory transmission underlies the disorder. Here, we show that transgenic mice with deficient glycine and GABA transmission have a behavioral, motor, and sleep phenotype that recapitulates the cardinal features of RBD. Specifically, we show that mice with impaired glycine and GABA(A) receptor function exhibit REM motor behaviors, non-REM muscle twitches, sleep disruption, and EEG slowing--the defining disease features. Importantly, the RBD phenotype is rescued by drugs (e.g., clonazepam and melatonin) that are routinely used to treat human disease symptoms. Our findings are the first to identify a potential mechanism for RBD--we show that deficits in glycine- and GABA(A)-mediated inhibition trigger the full spectrum of RBD symptoms. We propose that these mice are a useful resource for investigating in vivo disease mechanisms and developing potential therapeutics for RBD.", 
    "140": "Non-epileptic paroxysmal movement disorders are rare extrapyramidal diseases. The clinical signs are often excluded from differential diagnosis due to their paucity on clinical examination and low prevalence. The paroxysmal, stereotypical nature of non-epileptic paroxysmal movement disorders, as well as the potential response to benzodiazepines, renders these disorders susceptible to misdiagnosis as epileptic seizures. We report a case of paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia which was misdiagnosed and treated as epilepsy for decades. The major pathophysiological, diagnostic and therapeutic hallmarks of the disease are summarised. Familiarity and inclusion of the disease in the list of conditions that mimic epilepsy, as well as prolonged video-EEG recordings, may prevent diagnostic delays and unnecessary or belated treatments.

    "141": "We report a six-year-old girl with seizures induced by both micturition and defecation. Several days after unprovoked generalised tonic-clonic seizures, she developed reflex seizures characterised by the extension of both arms and rhythmic jerking of her upper body. No abnormal findings were noted on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) showed spike-and-wave activity on central electrode recording, and rhythmic fast activity was recorded by central electrodes during the ictal EEG upon micturition. The combination of clobazam and phenytoin was effective for both unprovoked and reflex seizures. Although some previous reports have described reflex seizures triggered by either micturition or defecation, this is the first case report of reflex seizures induced by both micturition and defecation in the same patient. Based on a comparison with previous cases of reflex seizures induced either by micturition or defecation, the neuronal pathway from the pelvic base musculature to the supplementary motor area may be responsible for the condition in our patient.", 
    "142": "Honokiol, an active agent extracted from magnolia bark, has been reported that induces anxiolytic action in a mouse elevated plus-maze test. However, the mechanism of anxiolytic action induced by honokiol remains unclear. This study was to investigate the change in two forms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GABA synthesized enzymes) GAD(65) and GAD(67) in the cortex and hippocampus areas while the anxiolytic actions induced by chronic administration of honokiol in mice. Mice treated with 7 daily injection of honokiol (1mg/kg, p.o.) caused anxiolytic action which was similar to that was induced by 7 daily injection of diazepam (2mg/kg, p.o.) in the elevated plus-maze test. In addition, the activity of hippocampal GAD(65) of honokiol treated mice was significantly increased than that of the vehicle or diazepam treated groups. These data suggest that honokiol causes diazepam-like anxiolytic action, which may be mediated by altering the synthesis of GABA in the brain of mice.", 
    "143": "The false-suffocation hypothesis of panic disorder (Klein, 1993) suggested \u03b4-opioid receptors as a possible source of the respiratory dysfunction manifested in panic attacks occurring in panic disorder (Preter and Klein, 2008). This study sought to determine if a lack of \u03b4-opioid receptors in a mouse model affects respiratory response to elevated CO\u2082, and whether the response is modulated by benzodiazepines, which are widely used to treat panic disorder. In a whole-body plethysmograph, respiratory responses to 5% CO\u2082 were compared between \u03b4-opioid receptor knockout mice and wild-type mice after saline, diazepam (1mg/kg), and alprazolam (0.3mg/kg) injections. The results show that lack of \u03b4-opioid receptors does not affect normal response to elevated CO\u2082, but does prevent benzodiazepines from modulating that response. Thus, in the presence of benzodiazepine agonists, respiratory responses to elevated CO\u2082 were enhanced in \u03b4-opioid receptor knockout mice compared to wild-type mice. This suggests an interplay between benzodiazepine receptors and \u03b4-opioid receptors in regulating the respiratory effects of elevated CO\u2082, which might be related to CO\u2082 induced panic.",

While some are directly useful in commercial applications, others are valuable for studying and understanding biological phenomena at the molecular level. An example is the signaling of nerve cells, which has been explored in considerable detail using a number of bioactive natural products. This review concerns primarily a part of the GABA inhibitory system of the central nervous system, the GABA(A) receptors, and natural products that have been reported to affect GABA(A) receptors in various ways. As the major inhibitory neurotransmittor, GABA plays a central role in the function of the central nervous system and modulates the activities of all neurons. Malfunctions in the GABA-operated systems cause a number of severe mental disorders, which consequently, at least in theory, can be treated with drugs. The natural products discussed in this review, acting on the GABA(A) receptors, are divided into the three main classes; terpenoids, polyacetylenic alcohols, and flavonoids. In addition, in a second part of the review, it is exemplified how knowledge about quantitative structure-activity relationships for a molecular target can be used to design novel, potent and selective compounds targeting the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptors.",

Nutmeg has traditionally been used as a spice in food preparation and as an herbal remedy in the treatment of many medical conditions, including anxiety. Fifty-five rats were divided equally into 5 groups: control (vehicle); myristicin; midazolam (positive control); flumazenil and myristicin; and midazolam and myristicin. The behavioral component of anxiety was examined by using the elevated plus-maze (open-arm and closed-arm times) along with analysis of gross and fine motor movements. Data analysis was performed using a 2-tailed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and least significant difference post-hoc test. Our data suggest that myristicin does not decrease anxiety by modulation of the GABA(A) receptor but may promote anxiogenesis. When myristicin was combined with midazolam, an antagonist-like effect similar to the flumazenil and myristicin combination was exhibited by a decrease in anxiolysis compared with the midazolam-only group. Myristicin may antagonize the anxiolytic effects of midazolam, increase anxiety, and affect motor movements.",

    "155": "Imaging studies have revealed a putative neural account of emotional bias in decision making. However, it has been difficult in previous studies to identify the causal role of the different sub-regions involved in decision making. The Ultimatum Game (UG) is a game to study the punishment of norm-violating behavior. In a previous influential paper on UG it was suggested that frontal insular cortex has a pivotal role in the rejection response. This view has not been reconciled with a vast literature that attributes a crucial role in emotional decision making to a subcortical structure (i.e., amygdala). In this study we propose an anatomy-informed model that may join these views. We also present a design that detects the functional anatomical response to unfair proposals in a subcortical network that mediates rapid reactive responses. We used a functional MRI paradigm to study the early components of decision making and challenged our paradigm with the introduction of a pharmacological intervention to perturb the elicited behavioral and neural response. Benzodiazepine treatment decreased the rejection rate (from 37.6% to 19.0%) concomitantly with a diminished amygdala response to unfair proposals, and this in spite of an unchanged feeling of unfairness and unchanged insular response. In the control group, rejection was directly linked to an increase in amygdala activity. These results allow a functional anatomical detection of the early neural components of rejection associated with the initial reactive emotional response. Thus, the act of immediate rejection seems to be mediated by the limbic system and is not solely driven by cortical processes, as previously suggested. Our results also prompt an ethical discussion as we demonstrated that a commonly used drug influences core functions in the human brain that underlie individual autonomy and economic decision making.", 
    "156": "One of the possible mechanisms by which the weight-reducing surgical procedure ileal interposition (II) works is by increasing circulating levels of lower gut peptides that reduce food intake, such as glucagon like peptide-1 and peptide YY. However, since this surgery involves both lower and upper gut segments, we tested the hypothesis that II alters the satiety responses evoked by the classic upper gut peptide cholecystokinin (CCK). To test this hypothesis, we determined meal size (MS), intermeal interval (IMI) and satiety ratio (SR) evoked by CCK-8 and -33 (0, 1, 3, 5nmol/kg, i.p.) in two groups of rats, II and sham-operated. CCK-8 and -33 reduced MS more in the sham group than in the II group; CCK-33 prolonged IMI in the sham group and increased SR in both groups. Reduction of cumulative food intake by CCK-8 in II rats was blocked by devazepide, a CCK(1) receptor antagonist. In addition, as previously reported, we found that II resulted in a slight reduction in body weight compared to sham-operated rats. Based on these observations, we conclude that ileal interposition attenuates the satiety responses of CCK. Therefore, it is unlikely that this peptide plays a significant role in reduction of body weight by this surgery.",

Taking account of the limits of this study in the FPVD (under-reporting, notoriety bias etc.), the case/noncase method allows assessment and detection of associations between exposure to drugs and a specific adverse drug reaction, such as memory disorders, and could thus generate signals and orientate us to further prospective studies to confirm such associations.", 
    "165": "Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide. Cannabis users also appear to use other psychoactive drugs more frequently than noncannabis users. Here, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and diazepam binding to human serum albumin (HSA) and HSA-heme is reported. THC binds to two different binding sites of HSA (K(d1) \u2264 10(-7) M and K(d2) = 10(-3)M) without affecting diazepam binding (K(d) = 1.2 \u00d7 10(-5) M). THC binding to the high-affinity site accounts for the low free fraction of the drug in plasma. Moreover, THC increases the affinity of heme for HSA. Accordingly, the affinity of THC for HSA-heme is higher than that for HSA. THC could bind to FA2 and FA7 sites, as substantiated by docking simulations; nevertheless, the observed allosteric effect(s) suggests that the primary binding site of THC is the FA2 cleft that positively modulates heme affinity. Possibly, the HSA conformational transition(s) induced by THC binding could account for drug delivery to the liver through receptor- mediated endocytosis.",

OLA did not affect the secretion of any of these hormones, except for ghrelin levels, which were increased compared with controls. Furthermore, when ghrelin levels were determined in rats just before they received their meal, OLA caused a significant increase in ghrelin levels compared with controls, whereas OLA failed to affect baseline ghrelin levels. Next, we investigated the effect of OLA on the efficacy of CCK to reduce meal size. With coadministration, OLA pretreatment counteracted the reduction in meal size by CCK, although there was no significant interaction between the treatments. Finally, telemetry measurements revealed that acute OLA treatment causes a temporary decrease in both locomotor activity and body core temperature.",

Preclinical evidence suggests that drugs acting at the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system may be useful for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and other stress-related disorders (Valdez, 2006), hence we have now examined the effects of a CRF(1) receptor antagonist in the 7.5% CO(2) model. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in 32 healthy participants we examined the effects of 7 days of treatment with the CRF(1) receptor antagonist, R317573, at a dose that shows a favourable safety profile and is comparable with those effective in preclinical models (40\u2009mg). On day 8, eight of the placebo-treated group received lorazepam (LZP) 2\u2009mg as a positive control. All participants underwent 20\u2009min inhalation of 7.5% CO(2)-enriched air. Subjective reports of peak gas effects were assessed using visual analogue scales and questionnaires. The mean age of participants was 26 years, and 13 were male. The peak effects of CO(2) were expressed as a difference from baseline scores obtained while breathing air alone. Compared with placebo (PLAC), both drug groups showed a decrease in all subjective symptoms, total score on the panic symptom inventory (CRF 11 [2.6], PLAC 16.4 [3.1], LZP 2.9 [3.0]) and a generalized anxiety disorder symptom scale (CRF 2.2 [1.5], PLAC 8.2 [2.2], LZP 1.1 [1.5]).

Most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in centers of excellence on highly selected samples, poorly representative of real-world patients, and often suffered conflicts of interest as they were sponsored by drug companies. The primary aim of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of haloperidol, olanzapine and aripiprazole in a representative sample of schizophrenia patients. The GiSAS trial is an open-label, independent, pragmatic RCT in Italian community-based public psychiatric services. At least 260 patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia will be randomly allocated to one of the study drugs and followed up for one year. A two-year observational phase will follow. The primary outcome for tolerability will be the onset of metabolic syndrome. The primary endpoint for effectiveness will be discontinuation of antipsychotic monotherapy. Secondary measures include global functioning, time to discontinuation due to side-effects, change of lipid profile, extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects. In the last four years, the GiSAS study group has been working to implement this multicenter RCT. The trial mechanism is now fully functional and working.

    "177": "The plants were gathered from Gilan Province in Iran. Plant aerial parts were extracted with methanol and concentrated in vacuum. Methanol extract was partitioned into chloroform, petroleum ether, and ethyl acetate. Each fraction was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in male mice with different concentrations (50, 100, and 200\u2009mg/kg), and for evaluation of sedative activity, immobility time was determined. In effort to clarify the mechanism of action, flumazenil (3\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) as a benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist was injected 15 min before chloroform fraction (200\u2009mg/kg, i.p.).",

Significant tumor growth inhibition was demonstrated in a lung cancer xenograft model with a range of once daily, weekly and twice-weekly doses of R1530 (3.125-50 mg/kg qd, 100 mg/kg qw, 100 mg/kg biw). Daily doses were most effective in the lung cancer model and also had significant growth inhibitory effects in models of colorectal, prostate, and breast tumors. Tumor regression occurred in all models treated with the maximum tolerated daily dose (50 mg/kg). The doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg qd resulted in biologically significant increased survival in all tested models. After oral administration in nude mice, R1530 showed good tissue penetration. Exposure was dose dependent up to 100 mg/kg with oral administration.",

A combination of anticoagulation, vasodilatation, and local selective and superselective thrombolysis with urokinase was performed to salvage the leg. As a result of the severe ischemia-induced pain, the patient had to be monitored over the complete therapy period on the intensive care unit with permanent administration of intravenous fluid and analgetics. We describe the presenting symptoms and the interventional technique, and we discuss the recent literature regarding the management of accidental intra-arterial injection of dissolved flunitrazepam tablets.", 
    "186": "Seizures are not an uncommon occurrence in older adults, and the incidence of status epilepticus is much greater in the elderly than in younger populations. Status epilepticus is a neurologic emergency and requires prompt intervention to minimize morbidity and mortality. Treatment involves both supportive care as well as initiation of medications to stop all clinical and electrographic seizure activity. Benzodiazepines are used as first-line agents, followed by antiepileptic drugs when seizures persist. In refractory status epilepticus, urgent neurologic consultation is indicated for the titration of anesthetic agents to a level of appropriate background suppression on EEG. In light of our aging population, physician awareness and competence in the management of status epilepticus is imperative and should be recognized as a growing public health concern.",

The patient had a form of epilepsia partialis continua and neurological deterioration associated with hemiatrophy. Cranial MRI showed cerebral atrophy in the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, without abnormal intensity. Delayed IMZ SPECT showed widespread decreased accumulation of tracer in the left temporal and frontal regions. An early scan showed mildly decreased accumulation in the left temporal and frontal regions. Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) analysis showed that the decreased regions on delayed IMZ images were slightly larger as compared with the previous IMZ study performed. Some regions without decreased accumulation of tracer on Tc-ECD or early IMZ images showed decreased accumulation on delayed IMZ images. This case study suggests that benzodiazepine receptors may be reduced in the affected hemisphere of patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis.",

Participants received a baseline evaluation including a cognitive battery consisting of an evaluation of psychomotor function, general executive function, visual and verbal memory, and visuospatial ability. Their fasting serum cholesterol level was also assessed. The participants were then randomized to clozapine, olanzapine, or haloperidol. They were evaluated at the end of 12 weeks. A general cognitive index (GCI) derived from the cognitive battery was the primary variable.",

There was a statistically and clinically significant positive association between change in cholesterol levels and change in GCI. This association was especially pronounced for verbal memory. There was no interaction between medication grouping and cholesterol level; the positive association was observable separately in each medication group.

    "192": "Diazepam is one of the mostly used benzodiazepines and it is frequently analyzed in different biological samples, especially blood samples. The diazepam stability in the sample matrices is an important factor regarding reliable data obtaining. The storage is the main factor determining the stability of diazepam in blood samples and it is the object of the study presented. Remaining diazepam amount in spiked whole blood and plasma samples were tested at different storage temperatures, in the absence or presence of sodium fluoride as stabilizer as well as the influence of ethanol on diazepam stability was evaluated. The results of the study indicated that the temperature is the main storage factor affecting diazepam stability. In the fluoride stabilized blood samples the amount of diazepam decreases up to 85% of initial level when stored at -20\u00b0 C for the period of testing (12 weeks). The presence of low (0.5 g/L) or high (3g/L) ethanol concentrations influences the stability of diazepam at -20 \u00b0C. In whole blood samples, the combination of sodium fluoride and ethanol decreases additionally (15-25%) the concentration of the analyte. Freeze-thaw experiments of whole blood samples show about 5-9% decrease in diazepam concentration after the first cycle. The freeze-thaw experiments on plasma samples, containing ethanol and/or fluoride show insignificant decreases of analyte concentration. Further experiments on benzodiazepines stability at different storage conditions or in combination of different factors should be undertaken in forensic toxicology to ensure the data quality, their reliability and reproducibility.",

All patients were on at least one antihypertensive medication, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (37%), beta-blockers (35%), angiotensin receptor blockers (32%), diuretics (29%) and calcium channel blockers (21%). Backward multiple regression analysis showed that age (P \u2264 0.001) and the use of calcium channel blockers (P = 0.037) were the only factors inversely associated with lower total sleep time. Sleep efficiency was inversely associated only with age (P \u2264 0.001), whereas the use of calcium channel blockers had a nonsignificant trend (P = 0.092). Use of calcium channel blockers was associated with significant reduction in total sleep time (-41 min, P = 0.005) and 8% lower sleep efficiency (P = 0.004). No other antihypertensive medication, including diuretics and beta-blockers, was associated with sleep impairment.",

    "197": "The formation of mixed micelles built of 7,12-dioxolithocholic and the following hydrophobic bile acids was examined by conductometric method: cholic (C), deoxycholic (D), chenodeoxycholic (CD), 12-oxolithocholic (12-oxoL), 7-oxolithocholic (7-oxoL), ursodeoxycholic (UD) and hiodeoxycholic (HD). Interaction parameter (\u03b2) in the studied binary mixed micelles had negative value, suggesting synergism between micelle building units. Based on \u03b2 value, the hydrophobic bile acids formed two groups: group I (C, D and CD) and group II (12-oxoL, 7-oxoL, UD and HD). Bile acids from group II had more negative \u03b2 values than bile acids from group I. Also, bile acids from group II formed intermolecular hydrogen bonds in aggregates with both smaller (2) and higher (4) aggregation numbers, according to the analysis of their stereochemical (conformational) structures and possible structures of mixed micelles built of these bile acids and 7,12-dioxolithocholic acid. Haemolytic potential and partition coefficient of nitrazepam were higher in mixed micelles built of the more hydrophobic bile acids (C, D, CD) and 7,12-dioxolithocholic acid than in micelles built only of 7,12-dioxolithocholic acid. On the other hand, these mixed micelles still had lower values of haemolytic potential than micelles built of C, D or CD. The mixed micelles that included bile acids: 12-oxoL, 7-oxoL, UD or HD did not significantly differ from the micelles of 7,12-dioxolithocholic acid, observing the values of their haemolytic potential.",

The sub-groups were divided by a cut-off of 15 years. As expected, a negative correlation was found between AAO and duration of illness. The early-onset subjects had significantly lower age at the time of the assessment and they tended to have more often panic attacks but were treated less often with benzodiazepines and other anti-anxiety medications. The comparison analysis showed significant difference in the AAO distribution between our sample and four other study samples.",

Wistar rats received daily injections of olanzapine (3 or 6 mg/kg) and/or fluoxetine (12.5 or 25mg/kg) for 28 days, and we evaluated for BDNF, NGF and NT-3 protein levels in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Our results showed that treatment with fluoxetine and olanzapine alone or in combination did not alter BDNF in the prefrontal cortex (p=0.37), hippocampus (p=0.98) and amygdala (p=0.57) or NGF protein levels in the prefrontal cortex (p=0.72), hippocampus (p=0.23) and amygdala (p=0.64), but NT-3 protein levels were increased by olanzapine 6 mg/kg/fluoxetine 25mg/kg combination in the prefrontal cortex (p=0.03), in the hippocampus (p=0.83) and amygdala (p=0.88) NT-3 protein levels did not alter.

A lower proportion of the IDU had a prescription to use morphine in 2009 compared to 2008. The injection of methadone by IDU and methamphetamine users was common. A higher proportion of the IDU had injected methadone in 2009 compared to previous years. A higher proportion of the IDU had used oxycodone in 2009 compared to 2008 and prescription use of oxycodone by IDU was very low.

    "228": "The present study was aimed at investigating the effect and the possible mechanism of idebenone on endogenous glutamate release in nerve terminals of rat cerebral cortex (synaptosomes). Idebenone inhibited the release of glutamate that was evoked by exposing synaptosomes to the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and this phenomenon was concentration dependent. Inhibition of glutamate release by idebenone was prevented by chelating extracellular Ca(2+), or by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1, but was insensitive to DL-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate, a glutamate transporter inhibitor. Idebenone decreased the depolarization-induced increase in the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](C)),whereas it did not alter the resting synaptosomal membrane potential or 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of idebenone on evoked glutamate release was prevented by blocking the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but not by blocking intracellular Ca(2+) release or Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. Furthermore, the idebenone effect on 4-AP-evoked Ca(2+) influx and glutamate release was completely abolished by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors, H89 and KT5720. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that idebenone inhibits glutamate release from rat cortical synaptosomes and this effect is linked to a decrease in [Ca(2+)](C) contributed by Ca(2+) entry through presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and to the suppression of PKA signaling cascade.", 
    "229": "Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is a safe, effective, and appropriate form of anesthesia for many minor surgical procedures. The proliferation of outpatient procedures has heightened interest in MAC sedation agents. Among the most commonly used MAC sedation agents today are benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and propofol. Recently approved in the United States is fospropofol, a prodrug of propofol which hydrolyzes in the body by alkaline phosphatase to liberate propofol. Propofol liberated from fospropofol has unique pharmacological properties, but recently retracted pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations make it difficult to formulate clear conclusions with respect to fospropofol's PK/PD properties. In safety and efficacy clinical studies, fospropofol demonstrated dose-dependent sedation with good rates of success at doses of 6.5\u2009mg/kg along with good levels of patient and physician acceptance. Fospropofol has been associated with less pain at injection site than propofol. The most commonly reported side effects with fospropofol are paresthesia and pruritus. Fospropofol is a promising new sedation agent that appears to be well suited for MAC sedation, but further studies are needed to better understand its PK/PD properties as well its appropriate clinical role in outpatient procedures.", 
    "230": "We report a case of burning vulvar pain accompanied by erythema responding to an oral combination of a benzodiazepine and a beta blocker. The positive response to two medication classes used in the treatment of erythromelalgia supports the possibility of a localized manifestation of this disorder in the genital region.", 
    "231": "Delay to delivery of a reinforcer can decrease responding for that reinforcer and increase responding for smaller reinforcers that are available concurrently and delivered without delay; acute administration of drugs can alter responding for large, delayed reinforcers, although the impact of chronic treatment on delay discounting is not well understood. In this experiment, the effects of repeated administration of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam were studied in 6 pigeons responding on one key to receive food that was delivered immediately and on a second key to receive a larger amount of food that was delivered following delays which increased across a single session. Pigeons responded predominantly for the large reinforcer when there were no delays and when delays were short; however, as delays increased, responding for the large reinforcer decreased. Acutely, flunitrazepam (0.32, 1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased responding for the large reinforcer, shifting the discounting curve rightward and upward. Repeated administration of flunitrazepam (0.32, 1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg, each for six sessions, separated by one session during which vehicle was administered) did not markedly alter its effects on responding for the large reinforcer, indicating that the development of tolerance to this effect of flunitrazepam is modest under these conditions.", 
    "232": "Animal studies have shown that neonatal anaesthesia is associated with acute signs of neurodegeneration and later behavioural changes in adult animals. The anaesthetic effect of propofol is thought to be mediated by \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors. The present study investigated the effects on proteins important for normal neonatal brain development (i.e. BDNF, CaMKII, GAP-43, synaptophysin and tau), and adult spontaneous motor and anxiety-like behaviours in response to diazepam, after neonatal exposure to propofol. Ten-day-old mice were exposed to 0, 10 or 60 mg/kg bodyweight propofol. Neonatal propofol exposure changed the levels of BDNF in the brain, 24h after exposure, but did not alter any of the other proteins. Neonatal propofol exposure significantly changed the adult response to the GABA-mimetic drug diazepam, manifest as no change in spontaneous motor activity and/or reduced sedative effect and an extinguished effect on the reduction of anxiety-like behaviours in an elevated plus maze. Although no adult spontaneous behavioural changes were detected after neonatal propofol exposure, the exposure caused an adult dose-dependent decrease in the response to the GABA-mimetic drug diazepam. These changes may be due to neonatal alterations in BDNF levels.", 
    "233": "Eszopiclone (Lunesta\u00ae) is used for the treatment of insomnia. It is the S (+)-enantiomer of racemic zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone with no structural similarity to the hypnotic drugs zolpidem and zaleplon or to the benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Although eszopiclone interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid A-type (GABA(A)) receptor complex, it has a different binding profile than other sedative/hypnotic agents and modulates the receptor complex in a unique manner. Thus, eszopiclone might produce different pharmacological effects compared to other sedative/hypnotic agents. Beside their behavioral properties, sedative/hypnotic drugs affect the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In general, low doses of benzodiazepine-type drugs decrease, whereas high doses increase the activity of the HPA axis. Furthermore, benzodiazepines reduce stress-induced increases in HPA axis activity. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of eszopiclone on the HPA axis in the rat. Male rats were injected with saline or eszopiclone and trunk blood was collected for the measurement of plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone by radioimmunoassay. The acute administration of eszopiclone produced dose-dependent increases in plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone, and tolerance developed to these effects after repeated drug administration. Pretreatment with eszopiclone did not affect stress-induced stimulation of the HPA axis. These results show that eszopiclone and the benzodiazepine-type drugs differentially affect the HPA axis.", 
    "234": "Spasticity is a common disability in children with cerebral palsy. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthotics, rhizotomy, and orthopedic surgery, all play important roles in the management of spasticity. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of available medications for treatment of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Common medications include benzodiazepines, dantrolene sodium, baclofen, tizanidine, botulinum toxins, phenol, alcohol and intrathecal baclofen. In general, oral medications and intrathecal baclofen are used for treating generalized spasticity, whilst chemodenervation agents (botulinum toxins, phenol, and alcohol) are used to treat localized spasticity. There is more sufficient evidence for the recommendation of botulinum toxin A as an effective anti-spasticity treatment in children with cerebral palsy. However, more data concerning safety and long-term effects of botulinum toxin A is needed. Further study is needed to determine which kinds of medications can cause substantial improvement in daily activity, participation level, self-competence, or quality of life in children with cerebral palsy.", 
    "235": "Frotteurism is an aberrant behaviour wherein the person tends to rub or bring about physical contact between his genitals and an unrelated female to derive sexual pleasure. Our report describes an atypical case of hypersexual behaviour presenting in the form of masturbation with features of frotteurism and unipolar depression. The paper discusses the differential diagnosis and management of hypersexual behaviour."
