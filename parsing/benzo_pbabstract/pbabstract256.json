One of the methodological issues surrounding the use of the ligand in these studies is the highly variable kinetic behavior of [(11)C]PK11195 in plasma. We therefore undertook a study to measure the binding of [(3)H]PK11195 to whole human blood and found a low level of binding to blood cells but extensive binding to plasma proteins. Binding assays using [(3)H]PK11195 and purified human plasma proteins demonstrated a strong binding to alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and a much weaker interaction with albumin. Immunodepletion of AGP from plasma resulted in the loss of plasma [(3)H]PK11195 binding demonstrating: (i) the specificity of the interaction and (ii) that AGP is the major plasma protein to which PK11195 binds with high affinity. PK11195 was able to displace fluorescein-dexamethasone from AGP with IC(50) of <1.2 microM, consistent with a high affinity interaction. These findings are important for understanding the behavior of the ligand in positron emission tomography studies for three reasons. Firstly, AGP is an acute phase protein and its levels will vary during infection and pathological inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. This could significantly alter the free plasma concentrations of the ligand and contribute to its variable kinetic behavior. Secondly, AGP and AGP-bound ligand may contribute to the access of [(11)C]PK11195 to the brain parenchyma in diseases with blood brain barrier breakdown. Finally, local synthesis of AGP at the site of brain injury may contribute the pattern of [(11)C]PK11195 binding observed in neuroinflammatory diseases.",

(R)-8-[(123)I]Iodobretazenil displayed only non-specific binding. In vivo biodistribution of (S)-8-[(123)I]iodobretazenil in rats indicated high accumulation in regions of high BZR density. Radioactivity was blocked by preadministration with iodobretazenil and flumazenil, while non-BZR drugs had no effect on the uptake of activity in any brain region. (S)-8-[(123)I]Iodobretazenil uptake was saturable in a dose dependent manner (ID(50) = 0.13 mg/kg) in all brain regions. With the (R)-enantiomer no specific uptake was observed. Metabolite studies at 1-3 h p.i. indicated that greater than 95% of activity extracted from brain tissue corresponded to unchanged radiotracer while that in plasma was over 70%. (S)-8-[(123)I]Iodobretazenil potently and selectively labels BZR in vivo and deserves further investigation as a possible SPECT radiotracer.",

Before every anticipated painful procedure, a maintenance dose of 0.01 mg fentanyl was administered. If the procedure continued and the patient became aware, another 1mg midazolam was given. This was repeated if patients felt pain. A total dose of 0.08 mg fentanyl and 7 mg midazolam was never exceeded. Immediately after the procedure, the nurse was asked to evaluate patients' pain score. The patients were asked 3h later to complete a visual 10-degree pain score scale.", 
    "4": "The average dose of fentanyl and midazolam was 0.042 mg (0.03-0.08 mg) and 4.28 mg (2-7 mg), respectively. Only one patient recorded the procedure as painful. The scores given by the attending nurse (1-7 points, mean 2.9) correlated well with those given by the patients (1-6 points, mean 2.72). No complications were noted.",

At the studied doses, lorazepam and scopolamine produced similar decrements in psychomotor performance, free recall, and overall sensitivity in distinguishing between studied and nonstudied items on a recognition memory test. However, the drugs differed with respect to effects on working memory, response bias, metacognition, subjective awareness, and selective attention. In addition to providing information about the cognitive psychopharmacological profiles of drugs with distinct neurochemical and pharmacological mechanisms of action, this study also informs the understanding of memory and attentional processes.",

A target-controlled infusion of propofol was compared with patient-controlled propofol for sedation, combined with a small dose of midazolam to improve amnesia. The objectives of the study were to measure the total dose of propofol used by the two groups and assess recovery and patient satisfaction. The mean dose of propofol used in the patient-controlled sedation group was significantly less than the target-controlled group (p < 0.00007). Five patients became over-sedated in the target-controlled group compared with none in the patient-controlled group. Only one of the three tests of performance showed that the target-controlled patients were more sedated. Patient satisfaction was high in both groups despite a greater recollection of events in the patient-controlled group.", 
    "8": "Diazepam (DZP) is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for treating status epilepticus (SE). A simple, sensitive and selective LC/MS/MS method with a wide linear calibration range was developed to quantify DZP and its major metabolites, N-desmethyldiazepam (DMDZP), temazepam (TZP), and oxazepam (OZP), in rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The method was used to simultaneously determine the concentrations of all analytes in a small sample volume (as little as 25 microL) of rat CSF. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) of the method are 0.04 ng/mL for DZP and 0.1 ng/mL for its metabolites. The calibration range is 0.04-200 ng/mL for DZP and 0.1-200 ng/ml for the metabolites. All intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV) and mean percent errors of the method are less than 12%. This method successfully addresses the need to determine low therapeutic drug concentrations in small physiological samples, namely rat CSF. Moreover, it can be used to investigate the distribution of the drug and its metabolites among blood plasma, brain tissue, and CSF in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in a variety of laboratory animals. With respect to animal experiments involving assays in CSF, this method addresses two of the three criteria of Russell and Bruch (Principles of Humane Experimental Techniques, 1959, Methuen and Co., London) for minimizing animal use, namely refinement and reduction.", 
    "9": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone ( TRH) induces some somatic symptoms that resemble those of a panic attack, without being considered to be a laboratory panicogen in panic disorder (PD) patients. This study aimed to identify doses of TRH and the laboratory panicogens, pentagastrin and flumazenil, that would produce a similar intensity of panic-related somatic symptoms in healthy volunteers because comparison of the effects of these doses in PD patients could be used to test the hypothesis that these agents have specific panicogenic effects that are not explained solely by cognitively mediated reactions to somatic symptoms. Nine subjects were administered pentagastrin (0.2 micro g/kg) and TRH (600 or 1,200 micro g) in a double-blind, randomized order, within-subjects design. Fifteen subjects received pentagastrin (0.1 micro g/kg), TRH (600 or 1200 micro g) and flumazenil (2 mg) in a double-blind, randomized order within-subjects design. Although low dose pentagastrin (0.1 micro g/kg) induced comparable cardiorespiratory responses to those of TRH, it induced greater anxiety, suggesting that TRH would not be a credible comparator for pentagastrin in challenge studies in PD. However, TRH produced equal or greater symptom and physiological responses compared with flumazenil, suggesting that flumazenil may act as a panicogen in PD via a GABAergic mechanism rather than via a cognitively mediated response to somatic symptoms. This now requires confirmation in PD patients.",

    "11": "Aspirin, 50 mg daily, was given for 14 days to 18 nonsmoking healthy male volunteers. A modified 5-drug cocktail procedure consisting of caffeine, mephenytoin, metoprolol, chlorzoxazone, and midazolam was performed to simultaneously assess in vivo activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A, respectively. The activities were assessed on 4 occasions including at baseline, after 7 and 14 daily doses of aspirin, and at 7 days after discontinuation of aspirin. Concentrations of parent drugs and corresponding metabolites in biologic samples were assayed by reversed-phase HPLC.", 
    "12": "Both 7-day and 14-day aspirin intake increased the activity of CYP2C19 significantly, as indicated by 4-hydroxymephenytoin urinary recovery (P <.001). Induction of low-dose aspirin on CYP2C19 was time-dependent. CYP3A activity indices increased moderately but significantly by both 7-day and 14-day aspirin treatment (P <.05), but the percentage changes in CYP3A activity indices were not significant. Low-dose aspirin had no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 in vivo activity by either 7-day or 14-day treatment.", 
    "13": "The effect of low-dose aspirin on CYPs was enzyme-specific. Both 7-day and 14-day low-dose aspirin induced the in vivo activities of CYP2C19 but did not affect the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. The effect of low-dose aspirin on CYP3A activity awaits further confirmation. When low-dose aspirin is used in combination with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C19, doses of the latter should be adjusted to ensure their efficacy.",

A pharmacokinetic study was also conducted in 17 healthy adults (n = 8 women) who received intravenous midazolam (0.025 mg/kg), oral midazolam (0.15 mg/kg), and oral cisapride (0.07 mg/kg) in a randomized crossover design. Plasma concentrations were quantitated from repeated after-dosing blood samples by HPLC with ultraviolet detection for midazolam and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry detection for cisapride and norcisapride. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods. Both linear and nonlinear regression analyses were used to examine the association between the apparent plasma clearance of midazolam and cisapride and the cisapride/norcisapride plasma concentration ratios.", 
    "16": "Although not a substrate for P-glycoprotein, cisapride inhibited P-glycoprotein with an apparent inhibition constant (K(i)) of 16.1 micromol/L. Linear correlations between cisapride clearance and both intravenous and oral midazolam clearance (P =.01, r(2) = 0.43 and P =.001, r(2) = 0.46, respectively) were found. Cisapride/norcisapride plasma concentration ratios at 8 hours (P =.001, r(2) = 0.90) and 12 hours (P =.001, r(2) = 0.96), as well as cisapride plasma concentrations at these time points, were shown to accurately predict the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve for cisapride.", 
    "17": "CYP3A4 activity reflected by the total body clearance after oral administration of cisapride should be independent of transport by P-glycoprotein. Concordance between the pharmacokinetics for cisapride and midazolam support the applicability of oral cisapride as a pharmacologic substrate to assess total CYP3A4 activity in vivo. Cisapride plasma concentration ratios at 8 or 12 hours after a single oral cisapride dose may prove useful as a single-point determination to reflect the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve and the plasma clearance of cisapride and, as well, total CYP3A4 activity in vivo.",

    "19": "We reviewed 425 consecutive admissions of 269 patients with manic or mixed affective episodes in a Brazilian private psychiatric hospital. Lengths of stay (LOSs) were compared for admissions in which ECT versus exclusive pharmacologic treatment was administered. A mixed model for repeated measures was developed to control for intraindividual correlations and potential demographic, clinical, and treatment confounder variables. The analyses were repeated using LOS minus the time until ECT was first given in each admission (LOS-tECT) as the response variable.", 
    "20": "Use of ECT was associated with longer LOS than exclusive pharmacologic treatment (18.78 versus 12.51 days; p < 0.001). This effect disappeared when using LOS-tECT as the response variable (11.57 versus 12.16 days; p = 0.530). Violent behavior and in-hospital use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were also associated with longer LOS, whereas being married was associated with shorter LOS.",

In this article, a whole blood solvent extraction method was evaluated using data of 13 subjects.",

    "26": "A previous receptor binding assay indicated that baicalein, one of the active principles of the Chinese herbal drug, Huangqin (Scutellariae Radix), interacts with the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors in mouse cortex membrane preparations with a K(i) value of 13.1 microM. Therefore, the present study examined whether baicalein and its 7-glucuronide, baicalin, have anxiolytic-like effects in a Vogel conflict test adapted for ICR mice. The results showed that both baicalein (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and baicalin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased the number of shocks accepted in the Vogel lick-shock conflict paradigm over 9 min, as did a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Since the total volume of water intake and the shock sensitivity of mice were not significantly changed after drug treatment, the effect of baicalein or baicalin was not due to an enhancement of thirst or shock tolerance. Furthermore, this anxiolytic-like effect of baicalein or baicalin was antagonized by co-administration with a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (2 mg/kg, i.p.), but not with a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, pindolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.). It is concluded that the anxiolytic-like effect of baicalein or baicalin may be mediated through activation of the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "27": "The serotonin (5-HT) syndrome is the most serious toxic interaction of antidepressants, but no pharmacotherapy has yet been established. In the present study, we created an animal model of the 5-HT syndrome by intraperitoneally injecting rats with clorgyline (2 mg/kg) and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) (100 mg/kg) and evaluated the effectiveness of potent 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists and GABA-enhancing drugs, including diazepam and chlormethiazole. The rectal temperature of the rats was measured, and the noradrenaline (NA) and 5-HT levels in the anterior hypothalamus were measured by microdialysis. In the group pre-treated with saline, the rectal temperature increased to more than 40 degrees C, and all of the animals died within 90 min after administration. Pre-treatment with potent 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists prevented the development of hyperthermia and death in the rats. Pre-treatment with diazepam, 10 and 20mg/kg, and chlormethiazole, 50 and 100mg/kg, attenuated the development of hyperthermia. Although neither of these drugs completely prevented the rats from dying, they prolonged their survival time. Regardless of the type of therapeutic agents, the concentration of 5-HT increased to about 1100-fold the pre-administration level. The NA levels in the saline group increased to about 16-fold the pre-administration levels, but the increase was significantly lower in the rats that survived as a result of drug therapy. These results suggest that GABA-mimetic drugs may be effective against the 5-HT syndrome, although they have a somewhat weaker effect than the potent 5-HT(2A) receptor blockers, and that not only is 5-HT activity increased in the brain in the 5-HT syndrome, but the NA system is also enhanced.", 
    "28": "Prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ), a positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor complex, exerts profound effects that become more evident during puberty and in many cases are sex-specific, suggesting that such exposure interferes with the activity of steroid hormones. Apart from their well known effects on the genome, the reduced metabolites of many steroid hormones also interact directly with membrane receptors, including those for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). In this study, we compared the effects of several neurosteroids on NMDA receptors from normal rats and those exposed in utero to DZ (1.25mg/kg per day) from the 14th through the 20th day of gestation. In superfused rat hippocampal synaptosomes, activation of the NMDA receptor stimulates the basal release of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA), which was used in our study as an index of receptor function. [3H]NA release was evoked in a concentration-dependent manner by NMDA (100 microM) plus glycine (GLY). The maximal increase (68.23+/-3.86%) with respect to basal release was achieved with a GLY concentration of 10 microM, and the EC(50) for GLY was 0.1 microM. Release stimulated by 100 microM NMDA + 0.1 microM GLY was not modified by any of the neurosteroids tested, with the exception of pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S), which produced a 78.57+/-3.94% reduction in release at the maximal concentration used (0.3 microM). In synaptosomes from animals exposed in utero to DZ, the inhibitory effect of PREG-S was reduced by 46.55+/-2.33%. Given the important roles played by NMDA receptors in physiological and pathological processes within the central nervous system (CNS), characterization of NMDA receptor modulation is an important objective. The fact that this modulation can be altered by exposure in utero to DZ indicates that the behavioral abnormalities observed in exposed animals might be partially attributed to an altered sensitivity of NMDA receptors to the modulatory effects of neurosteroids.", 
    "29": "It is estimated that about 2.5 million people only in the United States are affected by epilepsy. Labelled red blood cells (RBC) and plasma proteins (PP) are used for several evaluations in nuclear medicine and drugs affecting those labelings have previously been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the most popular antiseizure drugs interfere with the 99mTc labeling process of RBC and PP. Heparinized blood withdrawn from Wistar rats was incubated with phenobarbital (0.2, 2, 20, 200, 2,000 microg/ml), phenytoin (0.15, 1.5, 15, 150, 1,500 microg/ml), carbamazepine (0.7, 7, 70 microg/ml), clonazepam (0.5, 5, 50, 500 microg/ml) or valproic acid (0.5, 5, 50, 500 microg/ml) for I hr. Stannous chloride (SnCl2), in two different concentrations (0.012 or 1.2 microg/ml) and 99mTc were added. Plasma and cellular fractions were isolated by centrifugation, soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The percentage of radioactivity was calculated for each fraction. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA and Dunnet tests. The analysis of the results has shown that phenobarbital (2,000 microg/ml) and clonazepam (50 microg/ml) significantly have reduced the RBC labeling efficiency when it was used the optimal SnCl2 concentration (1.2 microg/ml) and clonazepam (5, 50 microg/ml) has significantly decreased the PP labeling efficiency with 99mTc. Phenytoin (1,500 microg/ml) has decreased the RBC labeling efficiency when the experiments were carried out with a small SnCl2 concentration (0.012 microg/ml). We can suggest that with this in vitro assay, at the therapeutic level of phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and valproic acid will not interfere on the 99mTc labeling process of RBC. Interference is displayed at higher phenobarbital concentrations (2,000 microg/ml). However, humans do not tolerate this concentration. On the other hand, a decreased RBC and PP labeling efficiency with 99mTc may be expected for clonazepam at therapeutic levels.", 
    "30": "In this double-blind study, 104 women were randomized to receive 1 mg lorazepam or placebo prior to a first-trimester abortion. In addition, 262 women were allowed to choose whether or not to take the lorazepam. The outcome measures were 11-point verbal pain scales of pain during the abortion and anxiety measured before premedication and during the abortion. The mean anxiety and pain scores did not differ significantly in the lorazepam and placebo groups of the randomized trial. In the observational group, the women who took lorazepam had their mean anxiety score drop from 5.5 to 4.7 while in those who did not take it, the score rose from 3.8 to 4.9. This study indicates that giving oral benzodiazepines preoperatively is neither helping nor hurting our patients but the placebo effect can be helpful to make our patients more comfortable.",

Significant hyperphagia (p < 0.01) was observed with the 8 mg/kg dose. By contrast, the 8 mg/kg dose did not affect water intake in thirsty rats. The data suggests that beta-CMC has properties on food intake similar to those of a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist.",

    "43": "In rats, the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis induces an intestinal inflammation, but after the inflammation had resolved and the worm burden eliminated, morphological alterations of the intestinal wall, mainly consisting of mast cell hyperplasia and enteric nerve remodeling, persist for several weeks. Intestinal signals reaching the brain through the vagus nerve and involving neuropeptides such as CCK, play a role in the control of food intake. Our hypothesis was that neuroimmune alterations of the intestine may alter this control. This work was aimed to evaluate whether post-infection alterations of the intestinal wall may affect the satiety effects of CCK and further, the role of mast cells and their mediators, histamine and serotonin, in post-N. brasiliensis-infected rats. In basal conditions, food intake was not different in control and post-infected groups of rats. Post-infected rats were characterized by prolonged satiety effects of both CCK and histamine but not serotonin. The prolonged effect of CCK was reduced when mast cells were previously stabilized by ketotifen, which had no effect per se on food intake. No difference was observed in the increase of food intake induced by CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists in both control and post-infected rats. Mast cell degranulation with compound 48/80 induced severe anorectic effects that lasted for less than 24h in post-infected rats and as long as 6 days in controls. Thus, in our experimental conditions, i.e., within 30-50 days post-N. brasiliensis infection, we observed an enhancement of the anorectic effect of exogenous CCK involving mast cell degranulation and histamine.",

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), an enzyme with a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, has been implicated in the action of anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants, but little is known as to its role in the action of different drugs employed for treatment of psychiatric disorders.",

Haloperidol induced no change, whereas lithium significantly decreased the activity. Kinase activation by antidepressants was further demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of exogenously added recombinant synaptotagmin. Immunoreactivity of vesicular kinase (alpha-isoform) was significantly increased by reuptake blockers but not by the two other drugs. Kinetic analysis showed that limiting value of enzymatic velocity (Vmax) of the kinase for substrate was also increased by reuptake blockers and decreased by lithium; however, neither messenger ribonucleic acid nor protein expression level of the kinase was increased in frontal/prefrontal cortex homogenates of antidepressant-treated rats, suggesting the involvement of local synaptic mechanisms.",

The EEG response in the 11.5- to 30-Hz frequency band was used as the pharmacodynamic end point.", 
    "54": "Infusion of MDL resulted in a mean steady-state plasma concentration of 66 +/- 3 ng/ml. A significant pharmacokinetic interaction with TGB was observed. MDL inhibited TGB clearance by 20 +/- 7 ml/min/kg from the original value of 89 +/- 6 ml/min/kg. However, no changes in plasma protein binding of both drugs were observed. The concentration-EEG relation of TGB was described by the sigmoid-Emax model. The pharmacodynamic parameter estimates of TGB were: Emax = 327 +/- 10 microV, EC50 = 392 +/- 20 ng/ml, and nH = 3.1 +/- 0.3. These values were not significantly different in the presence of MDL. Factors that may explain the lack of synergism were identified by a mechanism-based interaction model that separates the receptor activation from the signal-transduction process. High efficiency of signal transduction and the presence of a baseline response were shown to diminish the degree of synergism.", 
    "55": "We conclude that the in vivo pharmacodynamic interaction between MDL and TGB is additive rather than synergistic. This strongly suggests that allosteric modulation of the antiseizure activity of a GAT-1 inhibitor by a benzodiazepine does not offer a therapeutic advantage.",

This study examines data gathered from a survey of 64 families in the USA and abroad regarding the self-injury of their family members who have LND. The individuals with LND ranged in age from 1 to 40 years (mean 16 years 7 months, SD 11 years 2 months) and, with the exception of one, were males. The most common initial mode of self-mutilation, and the most frequently cited past or current behavior, was biting of lips and/or fingers. Other behaviors, in order of frequency, included head banging, extension of arms when being wheeled through doorways, tipping of wheelchairs, eye-poking, fingers in wheelchair spokes, and rubbing behaviors. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified patterns of association among the types of self-mutilation. Modes of self-mutilation in which external surfaces (such as a wheelchair component) served as instruments of self-injury tended to co-occur, as did biting of lips and fingers.",

Tolerance (4-point scale: 1 excellent, 4 unbearable), pain (4-point scale: 1 none, 4 severe) and willingness to undergo another colonoscopy were assessed 24 to 48 hours later in a telephone interview conducted by an independent observer blinded to the regimen of sedative medication.",

By multivariate analysis, randomization to the midazolam group and younger age were the only variables independently associated with the risk of reporting at least one of these outcomes. Recovery time, frequency of oxygen desaturation, and need for supplemental oxygen were not significantly different between the 2 groups.",

    "61": "We have previously reported that short-term (48-72 h) exposure to the GABA-modulatory steroid 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) increases expression of the alpha4 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) in the hippocampus of adult rats. This change in subunit composition was accompanied by altered pharmacology and an increase in general excitability associated with acceleration of the decay time constant (tau) for GABA-gated current of pyramidal cells acutely isolated from CA1 hippocampus similar to what we have reported following withdrawal from the steroid after chronic long-term administration. Because GABAR can be localized to either synaptic or extrasynaptic sites, we tested the hypothesis that this change in receptor kinetics is mediated by synaptic GABAR. To this end, we evaluated the decay kinetics of TTX-resistant miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices following 48-h treatment with 3alpha,5alpha/beta-THP (10 mg/kg, ip). Hormone treatment produced a marked acceleration in the fast decay time constant (tau(fast)) of GABAergic mIPSCs. This effect was prevented by suppression of alpha4-subunit expression with antisense (AS) oligonucleotide, suggesting that hormone treatment increases alpha4-containing GABAR subsynaptically. This conclusion was further supported by pharmacological data from 3alpha,5beta-THP-treated animals, demonstrating a bimodal distribution of taus for individual mIPSCs following bath application of the alpha4-selective benzodiazepine RO15-4513, with a shift to slower values. Because 40-50% of the individual taus were also shifted to slower values following bath application of the non-alpha4-selective benzodiazepine agonist lorazepam (LZM), we suggest that the number of GABAR synapses containing alpha4 subunits is equivalent to those that do not following 48-h administration of 3alpha,5beta-THP. The decrease in GABAR-mediated charge transfer resulting from accelerated current decay may then result in increased excitability of the hippocampal circuitry, an effect consistent with the increased behavioral excitability we have previously demonstrated.",

Fewer patients given lorazepam (59%, N=40 of 68) completed the trial than did those given placebo (73%, N=50 of 69), 600 mg/day of pregabalin (71%, N=50 of 70), or 150 mg/day or pregabalin (90%, N=62 of 69). The mean baseline-to-endpoint decreases in total Hamilton anxiety scale score in the patients given 150 mg/day of pregabalin (-9.2), 600 mg/day of pregabalin (-10.3), and lorazepam (-12.0) were significantly greater than the decrease in those given placebo (-6.8). As early as the week 1 observation, pregabalin significantly reduced the total Hamilton anxiety scale score compared with placebo. The most frequent adverse events reported for pregabalin and lorazepam were somnolence and dizziness. There were no serious adverse events reported by patients given pregabalin, and no withdrawal syndrome was associated with pregabalin treatment.",

Use of prescription sedative-hypnotics (primarily benzodiazepines) increased from 1.8% to 3.1%, and over-the-counter sedative-hypnotic use (primarily diphenhydramine) increased from 0.4% to 7.6%. At Wave 5 (1996-1998), 8.17% of the sample reported using diphenhydramine as a sleep aid. After adjusting for age and sex, diphenhydramine use was associated with higher education and more depressive symptoms, the latter becoming nonsignificant after controlling for initial insomnia. MMSE became significantly associated with diphenhydramine use when 143 subjects with dementia were excluded from the analysis.", 
    "69": "As the cohort aged, prescription sedative-hypnotic use remained relatively stable, whereas over-the-counter sedative use, principally diphenhydramine, increased substantially.

Prior studies on volunteers showed that there was a clear correlation between N-REM sleep and SEF in 90% of cases. Based on these findings, the authors propose a modified suppressed consciousness scale whose rating was adjusted to the levels of N-REM sleep. Irrespective of the type and technique of sedation (infusion of thiopental and propofol; PCS, midazolam), changes in the levels of drug-depressed consciousness were found to be the same.", 
    "71": "Two procedures for intravenous anesthesia during X-ray surgical interventions were evaluated in 38 children aged 3 to 13 years. Initial anesthesia (with intramuscular midazole and ketamine), followed by the fractional use of the latter agents in Group 1 and propofol in Group 2, in order to maintain anesthesia. Blood pressure (BP) (noninvasively), heart rate (HR), SpO2, and respiratory rate (RR) were monitored. After the initial anesthesia, mean BP (BPmean) increased by 40 and 24% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. So did HR by 23 and 31%, respectively. In Group these changes retained throughout the basic stage of intervention. In Group 2 on propofol infusion, BPmean and HR returned to normal values and remained at this level till the end of the intervention, SpO2 and RR did not differ from the baseline values in both groups. Thus, a combination of intravenous ketamine and intramuscular propofol provides steady-state values of BP and HR at the basic state of X-ray surgical intervention in children, which increases the reliability of studies and surgical safety in patients.",

Group 1 comprised 35 patients in whom tracheal extubation was made in the operating room 30-60 min after the end of the operation. Group 2 included 32 patients extubated 2-8 hours after admission to the resuscitation and intensive care unit (RICU); Group 3 consisted of 48 patients undergone tracheal intubation for more than 8 hours. The patients of this group received traditional anesthesia using ketamine, benzodiazepines, and large-dose fentanyl. The developed combined anesthesia with inhalational and intravenous anesthetics having their better pharmacodynamics, such as isoflurane, diprivan, tracrium, was used in 60.3% of the patients in Groups 1 and 2. The developed type of anesthesia using a high thoracic (T2-T4) epidural blockade as a basic component of anesthesiological maintenance was studied. In Group 2, the preextubation time was twice less than that in a control group (5.2 +/- 0.3 and 10.8 +/- 0.4 hours, respectively, p < 0.05). In groups with early extubation, the incidence of clinically significant cardiovascular disorders was less than that in the controls, which is indicative of better performance of the cardiovascular system. In Group 1, the frequency of reintubations for arterial hypoxemias was 2.8% and that of pneumonias and pulmonary microatelectasis was 2.5 times less as that in Group 3 (9%, p < 0.05). Chills occurred in 6, 4, and 15% of cases in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p < 0.05). A programme on early activation after aortocoronary bypass surgery could reduce the patients' stay at the RICU on an average by 24 hours without increasing the risk for postoperative complications.", 
    "73": "The specific features of the course of anesthesia and the time of extubation were studied in 142 patients suffering from coronary heart disease who had undergone myocardial revascularization. All the patients were divided into 3 groups in accordance with the type of anesthesia. Group 1 patients (n = 48) received routine anesthesia with ketamine, benzodiazepines, and large-dose fentanyl. Group 2 (n = 45) had combined anesthesia with inhalational and intravenous anesthetics having their better pharmacodynamics (such as isoflurane, diprivan, tracrium). In Group 3 (n = 49), the authors employed another developed modality of anesthesia using high thoracic (TII-TIV) epidural anesthesia as a basic component of anesthesiological maintenance. The two developed modalities of anesthesia almost halved the use of total dose opioids, which promoted patients' early postoperative recovery of consciousness and respiration. The time before extubation was 9.9 +/- 2.1, 4.5 +/- 1.1, and 1.5 +/- 1.2 hours in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p < 0.05). The developed anesthesia procedure using isoflurane, midazolam, propofol, and small-dose fentanyl ensures safe and early (up to 6-hour) extubation in 73% of the patients undergone aortocoronary bypass surgery. The developed anesthesiological protocol based on thoracic epidural anesthesia enables extubation to be carried out on the operating table within an hour in 75% of patients after aortocoronary bypass surgery. A comparative intraoperative analysis of hemodynamics, the incidence of myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, glucose levels has indicated that the anesthesia techniques aimed at a patient's early activation are not inferior in the degree of protection to routine anesthesia using large doses of opioids, ketamine, and diazepam. When used in combination with thoracic epidural block, the methods are superior to the latter.",

This lipid emulsion formulation showed enhanced solubilization capacity as 10 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 0.9 mg/ml, and 1.8 mg/ml formulations for diazepam, tetrazepam, clonazepam, and lorazepam were achieved, respectively. Incorporating the drugs into the lipid emulsion did not alter its physicochemical properties. Also the free and the drug emulsion formulations displayed good physical stability after autoclaving and after around one year of storage at shelf, as no changes in the physicochemical properties were observed. Most drugs also showed stable behavior after autoclaving and after approximately 1 year of storage at shelf. The only exception was lorazepam, as only around 50% of the drug was still intact after autoclaving.",

Two patterns of irregular prolonged use were investigated: increase in use was associated with a shorter length of the first usage period and switching to another benodiazepine during the first 90 days; relapses of use were associated with a shorter length of first usage period and initial use of an anxiolytic. Gender and initial dosage were not associated with prolonged use at all.", 
    "79": "During the first 90 days after initiation of benzodiazepine use, a number of determinants of prolonged benzodiazepine use were visible.

    "84": "'Flashbacks' following use of hallucinogenic drugs have been reported for decades; they are recognized in DSM-IV as 'Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (Flashbacks)', or HPPD. We located and analyzed 20 quantitative studies between 1955 and 2001 examining this phenomenon. However, many of these studies were performed before operational criteria for HPPD were published in DSM-III-R, so they are difficult to interpret in the light of current diagnostic criteria. Overall, current knowledge of HPPD remains very limited. In particular (1) the term 'flashbacks' is defined in so many ways that it is essentially valueless; (2) most studies provide too little information to judge how many cases could meet DSM-IV criteria for HPPD; and consequently (3) information about risk factors for HPPD, possible etiologic mechanisms, and potential treatment modalities must be interpreted with great caution. At present, HPPD appears to be a genuine but uncommon disorder, sometimes persisting for months or years after hallucinogen use and causing substantial morbidity. It is reported most commonly after illicit LSD use, but less commonly with LSD administered in research or treatment settings, or with use of other types of hallucinogens. There are case reports, but no randomized controlled trials, of successful treatment with neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and clonidine. Although it may be difficult to collect large samples of HPPD cases, further studies are critically needed to augment the meager data presently available regarding the prevalence, etiology, and treatment of HPPD.",

We recorded their medical and seizure histories, concomitant antiepileptic medications, neurologic examination, and laboratory findings at the time of presentation following the overdose. We also recorded their progress and the evolution of laboratory abnormalities. Both patients progressed to coma and had generalized convulsive status epilepticus, requiring intubation and treatment with benzodiazepines. Both patients recovered within 2 days but had a non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis that persisted for 5-6 days. Physicians should carefully monitor patients treated with topiramate who develop signs of clinical depression. The non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis observed may be due to inhibition of renal cortical carbonic anhydrase.", 
    "87": "Selecting a specific antiepileptic drug for the treatment of seizures in those with mental retardation requires a balance of the drug's likely efficacy for both seizures and comorbid disorders versus adverse events. Phenobarbital is the most commonly used of the barbiturate drugs. Phenytoin is actually one of the best tolerated AEDs (side effects in most patients are signs of neurotoxicity). Carbamazepine is the drug of choice for many neurologists for the treatment of partial epilepsy, with a relative lack of sedation and low incidence of cosmetic, cognitive, and behavioral side effects. For more than 30 years, valproate has been available for treatment of generalized and partial seizures, convulsive or nonconvulsive. For this reason, it is used in the treatment of epilepsy in the multiply handicapped and mentally retarded. Benzodiazepines are the drug of choice for treatment of status epilepticus; however, good medical control requires early diagnosis and treatment.", 
    "88": "Background. Rectally administered benzodiazepine antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs) are a safe and effective therapy for acute repetitive seizures in patients on stable maintenance AEDs. Such medication provides an earlier treatment option for seizure control prior to emergency department (ED) visitation and may be administered outside of the hospital in carefully selected patients. The use of rectal medications, however, has a perceived association with fear and embarrassment. This study sought to address patient attitudes toward rectally delivered AEDs. Methods. A written, eight-question survey regarding adult patient attitudes toward rectal medication and ED visits was prospectively administered to 91 consecutive epilepsy patients in an epilepsy-based practice setting. Primary caretakers responded when patients were unable to do so. RESULTS: Forty-eight female and thirty-two male survey responses were analyzed. The mean patient population was age 42.7 years with epilepsy for 23.7 years on 1.7 AEDs with a seizure frequency of 6.6/month. The majority had partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures and had obtained at least a high school education. Three patients (6%) had symptomatic generalized epilepsy and required caretaker responses. Eleven of ninety-one (12.1%) surveys were incomplete for analysis. Seventy-six of eighty (95%) respondents completed at least 50% of the survey questions. Forty-three of sixty-four (67.2%) respondents were not embarrassed by rectal AEDs, and did not fear being teased by others. Additionally, most felt rectal AEDs were a good option in epilepsy management, yet would prefer a private setting for administration. Both seizures and rectal AED use appeared to be equally embarrassing to patients. While 53 of 76 (69.7%) reported ED visitation for seizures at some time, the vast majority (56/60, 93.3%) reported they would prefer treatment outside the hospital, as opposed to ED transport. Conclusions. The results from this adult patient survey suggest that individuals with epilepsy do not object to earlier administration of emergency rectal seizure medication relative to ED visitation. An undesirable perception of rectal medications in seizure emergencies does not appear to be limited by patient acceptance.", 
    "89": "A 44-year-old man with treated neurosyphilis presented with subclinical status epilepticus (SE) refractory to intravenous high-dose lorazepam, phenytoin, and valproic acid over 4 days. Ketamine infusion was instituted after low-dose propofol sedation with gradual control of electrographic seizures over 72h. Reevaluation 3 months later revealed diffuse cerebellar and worsened cerebral atrophy, consistent with animal models of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-mediated neurotoxicity. Animal studies of prolonged ketamine therapy are required before widespread human use in SE.", 
    "90": "In 1991, Dodrill carefully reviewed the behavioral effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and concluded: \"The area of behavioral effects of antiepileptic drugs is poorly defined, lacks recognized and validated methods of assessment, and has suffered from a number of methodological limitations, especially including the use of experimental designs which have led to the contamination of drug effects and subject effects\" (1). He further observed that the best controlled study showed that the behavioral effects of AEDs were quite limited; the benzodiazepines had the most consistently favorable effect, but were of limited utility in epilepsy, because they were not typically administered on a long-term basis; carbamazepine was associated with a favorable behavior change, but this change was seen most consistently in nonepileptic subjects; relatively few studies of valproic acid had been conducted; phenytoin was not associated with either a consistently positive or consistently negative change; and the barbiturates were clearly associated with the most negative behavior change. Since Dodrill's review, eight new AEDs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States, thereby dramatically increasing the therapeutic options for patients with epilepsy. These new drugs also increase the complexity of choosing the ideal drug for any given patient. Certainly a critical component of the decision to initiate or continue a specific treatment is the side effect profile of the medication. In clinical practice, behavioral and cognitive side effects of the older AEDs are significant concerns. This paper reviews the clinically important behavioral and cognitive side effects of the more commonly used, established AEDs as well as the newer AEDs within the limits of currently available published peer-reviewed literature and clinical experience. Particular emphasis is given to subpopulations at risk.", 
    "91": "Insomnia affects 30-35% of people living in developed countries. The impact of insomnia on daytime functioning and its relationship with medical and psychiatric illnesses necessitate early treatment to prevent insomnia becoming persistent and to avoid the development of complications. However, pharmacological strategies must achieve a balance between sedative and adverse effects. In the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have been the preferred drugs for the treatment of insomnia. Benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central receptor sites, named omega(1) and omega(2), which are located in different areas of the CNS. The sedative action of benzodiazepines is related to omega(1) receptors, whereas omega(2) receptors are responsible for their effects on memory and cognitive functioning. According to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups: short half-life (<3 hours), medium half-life (8-24 hours) and long half-life (>24 hours). The newer non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon have a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but they display specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These three 'Z' agents all share a short plasma half-life and limited duration of action. In addition, these agents are selective compounds that interact preferentially with omega(1) receptors (sedative effect), whereas benzodiazepines also interact with omega(2) receptors (adverse effects on cognitive performance and memory). Zaleplon is characterised by an ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 hour). Zolpidem and zopiclone have longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and 5 hours, respectively). These properties, together with the low risk of residual effect, may explain the limited negative influences of these agents on daytime performance. Psychomotor tasks and memory capacities appear to be better preserved by non-benzodiazepine agents than by benzodiazepines. When present, cognitive deficits almost exclusively coincide with the peak plasma concentration. In particular, impairment can emerge in the first hours after drug administration, whereas psychomotor and memory tests carried out 7-8 hours later (i.e. in the morning) generally show no relevant alterations. As with benzodiazepines, the three 'Z' non-benzodiazepine agents should be used for a limited period, even in chronic relapsing conditions. Further evaluation is needed of the safety of hypnosedative medications in the long-term management of insomnia.", 
    "92": "Chorea gravidarum is a rare syndrome in pregnancy. The clinical picture is of extrapyramidal symptoms such as involuntary movements, lack of coordination and slurred speech. Neuroleptics or benzodiazepines can be used for treatment. When antiphospholipid antibodies are shown to be present, corticosteroids, and sometimes aspirin, are added to the treatment. Movement disorders can also be associated with an increased central dopamine level. In this report, we present the case of a patient with chorea gravidarum in whom an etiologic factor has not been observed. We treated the symptoms with dopamine-blocking agents such as haloperidol. We believe that, if chorea gravidarum is not accompanied by other etiologic factors (such as antiphospholipid antibodies), there is no elevated risk for the mother and the fetus.", 
    "93": "Three patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities presented deterioration of the activities of daily living, which was revealed to be caused by prolonged non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Their condition improved by the treatment with antiepileptics. Case 1, a 4-year-old girl with profound psychomotor retardation and past history of West syndrome of unknown etiology, became unable to sit and eat orally above age of two years. EEG showed continuous generalized slow spike and wave bursts indicating NCSE. Continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam abolished EEG abnormalities of NCSE, and she regained the ability of oral feeding. Case 2, a 3-year-old boy with Angelman syndrome and past history of West syndrome, presented decreased mental response, poor oral intake and somnolence. EEG showed continuous slow spike and wave bursts, indicating NCSE. High-dose phenobarbital therapy and continuous intravenous injection of vitamin B6 were effective, and remarkably improved his psychomotor activities. Case 3, a 3-year-old boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, developed decreased psychomotor activity and loss of vocalization and walking. He could not sit by himself and became nearly bed-ridden. EEG showed very frequent generalized spike and wave bursts, showing NCSE. Continuous infusion of thiopental diminished NCSE, and he could walk again. Psychomotor deterioration in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities may be caused by NCSE, which should not be overlooked.",

Overall, the reduction in the mean total score with various drugs is inferior to 50%, probably because the chronic nature of the disorder is not amenable to drastic changes in short-term trials. Results with the LSAS and other scales justify a ranking of the efficacy of the drugs: Classical MAOIs > SRIs > RIMAs. Two controlled studies with benzodiazepines (clonazepam and bromazepam) would position them together with the SRIs relative to efficacy but with problems associated with unwanted effects and dependence. Controlled studies with SRIs (paroxetine and fluvoxamine) demonstrated very significant differences from placebo. Paroxetine is the SRI most extensively studied in Social Anxiety Disorder with positive therapeutic results.", 
    "95": "Two Wistar rat lines that have been selectively bred for high-anxiety-related behaviour (HAB) and low-anxiety-related behaviour (LAB) in the elevated plusmaze test may be considered as a genetically prone animal model to study the neurochemical correlates of anxiety-related behaviour. Because there are pronounced differences between the two lines both in baseline levels of open-arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze test and in sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of 1 mg/kg diazepam, we used these lines to investigate the pharmacology of the benzodiazepine binding site and the GABA binding site of cortical GABAA receptors. No difference in characteristics of flunitrazepam, zolpidem or muscimol binding to cortical GABAA receptors could be detected between the two lines. Although there was an increase in the brain concentration of the anxiolytic neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, both in HAB and LAB animals after a forced swim stress, allopregnanolone concentrations did not differ between the two lines. Moreover, plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations were similar in HAB and LAB animals. We conclude that anxiety-related behaviour and benzodiazepine sensitivity in these rat lines are likely to be independent of the pharmacology of cortical GABAA receptors.", 
    "96": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane, as a constituent of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-pore. Among its hypothesized functions, the regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and apoptosis have been suggested; in addition alterations of PBR site density have been shown in some neuropathologic conditions with putative mitochondrial involvement. The aim of this work has been to evaluate PBR kinetic binding parameters in platelets from patients affected by mitochondrial disorders (MD) with large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity.", 
    "97": "Using the specific PBR radioligand [(3) H] PK 11195, the kinetic binding parameters of PBR sites were determined in platelet membrane of 15 healthy subjects and 11 patients affected by different form of MD.", 
    "98": "Significant changes of dissociation constant (K(d)) and maximal number of binding sites (B(max)) values were evidenced in platelets of patients versus controls. In all patients the B(max) values were decreased (2,387.0 +/- 305.6 fmol/ mg proteins versus 4889.0 +/- 357.8 fmol/mg proteins, p< 0.05), whereas the K(d) values were higher in patients than controls (13.18 +/- 2.06 nM versus 5.63 +/- 0.46 nM, p< 0.05).", 
    "99": "These data suggest that the kinetic binding parameters of PBR are altered in MD and that the observed changes might be related to the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with MD.", 
    "100": "Acute exposure to progesterone or its neurosteroid derivative allopregnanolone (3alpha,5alpha-THP) is anxiolytic, consistent with the GABA modulatory effects of 3alpha,5alpha-THP at the GABA(A) receptor. However, continuous exposure to progesterone increases anxiety in association with increased expression of the benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA(A) receptor alpha4 subunit. Furthermore, negative mood symptoms and altered GABA(A) receptor pharmacology in patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder occur in the early luteal phase in association with peak circulating levels of progesterone and 3alpha,5alpha-THP. Because sex differences have been reported in steroid-regulated anxiety responses, the present study investigated the role of sex and development in the regulation of anxiety after short-term exposure to 3alpha,5alpha-THP. To this end, we compared the effects of hormone administration in adult male, adult female, and juvenile female rats. Increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze was evident in all groups after 48-h exposure to either 3alpha,5alpha-THP or progesterone. At this time point, alterations in the anxiolytic profile of benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists were also observed in both adult males and females in the elevated plus maze. However, sex differences in the acoustic startle response were observed after short-term hormone treatment such that only female rats displayed an increased response indicative of higher anxiety levels. These results suggest that although neurosteroid exposure may influence both the pharmacological properties of the GABA(A) receptor and the manifestation of anxiety in both sexes, the effects of neurosteroids may be modulated in a sex- and task-specific manner.", 
    "101": "gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a neurotransmitter in brain and an emerging drug of abuse, although its mechanism of action is poorly understood. This study characterized the role of GABA(A), GABA(B), and other receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB. Eight rats reliably discriminated 200 mg/kg GHB from saline after a median of 35 (range: 23-41) training sessions. GHB, a metabolic precursor 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDL), and the GABA(B) agonist (+/-)baclofen all occasioned greater than 83% responding on the GHB lever. The onset of action was similar for GHB and 1,4-BDL; however, 1,4-BDL exhibited a longer duration of action than GHB. The GHB precursor gamma-butyrolactone, the benzodiazepine diazepam, the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone, the opioid agonist morphine, and the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine elicited substantial GHB-appropriate responding, although none occasioned greater than 66% drug-lever responding. The barbiturate pentobarbital and the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol did not occasion greater than 17% drug-lever responding at any dose tested. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil attenuated GHB-lever responding occasioned by diazepam, but not GHB. The GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 35348 antagonized GHB-lever responding occasioned by baclofen or GHB. Small doses of the purported GHB receptor antagonist (2E)-(5-hydroxy-5,7,8,9-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[a][7]annulen-6-ylidene ethanoic acid (NCS-382) attenuated partially the effects of GHB, whereas larger doses of NCS-382 alone occasioned partial GHB-lever responding. These results implicate GABA(B) mechanisms in the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB and further suggest that the effects of 1,4-BDL under these conditions result from its conversion to GHB. That NCS-382 shares effects with GHB could explain the lack of antagonism reported for NCS-382 in some studies.", 
    "102": "Hyperactivated sperm motility is usually characterized by high-amplitude flagellar bends and asymmetrical flagellar beating. There is evidence that an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-gated Ca2+ store in the base of the flagellum provides Ca2+ to initiate hyperactivation; however, the identity of the store was not known. Ca2+ stores are membrane-bounded organelles, and the only two membrane-bounded organelles found in this region of sperm are the redundant nuclear envelope (RNE) and mitochondria. Transmission electron micrographs revealed two different compartments of RNE, one enriched with nuclear pores and the other containing few pores but extensive membranous structures with enlarged cisternae. Immunolabeling showed that IP3 receptors and calreticulin are located in the region containing enlarged cisternae. In other cell types, mitochondria adjacent to Ca2+ stores are actively involved in modulating Ca2+ signals by taking up Ca2+ released from stores and also may respond by increasing production of NADH and ATP to support increased energy demand. Nevertheless, bull sperm did not show an increase in NADH when Ca2+ was released from intracellular stores by thapsigargin to induce hyperactivation. Consistently, no net increase in ATP production was detected when sperm were hyperactivated, although ATP was hydrolyzed at a greater rate. Furthermore, blocking Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria by CGP-37157, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, did not inhibit the development of hyperactivated motility. We concluded that the intracellular Ca2+ store is the part of RNE that contains enlarged cisternae and that Ca2+ is released directly to the axoneme to trigger hyperactivated motility without the active participation of mitochondria.", 
    "103": "The partial opiate-receptor agonist buprenorphine has been suggested for treatment of heroin dependence, but there are few long-term and placebo-controlled studies of its effectiveness. We aimed to assess the 1-year efficacy of buprenorphine in combination with intensive psychosocial therapy for treatment of heroin dependence.", 
    "104": "40 individuals aged older than 20 years, who met DSM-IV criteria for opiate dependence for at least 1 year, but did not fulfil Swedish legal criteria for methadone maintenance treatment were randomly allocated either to daily buprenorphine (fixed dose 16 mg sublingually for 12 months; supervised daily administration for a least 6 months, possible take-home doses thereafter) or a tapered 6 day regimen of buprenorphine, thereafter followed by placebo. All patients participated in cognitive-behavioural group therapy to prevent relapse, received weekly individual counselling sessions, and submitted thrice weekly supervised urine samples for analysis to detect illicit drug use. Our primary endpoint was 1-year retention in treatment and analysis was by intention to treat.",

    "107": "Muscarinic facilitation of 14C-ACh release from post-ganglionic parasympathetic nerve terminals was studied in bladder strips prepared from spinal intact (SI) and spinal cord transected (SCT) rats. The spinal cord was transected at the lower thoracic spinal segments 3 weeks prior to the experiments. Using non-facilitatory stimulation (2 Hz) the release of ACh in spinal intact rats did not change in the presence of a non-specific muscarinic antagonist, atropine (100 nM), an M(1) specific antagonist (pirenzepine, 50 nM) or an M(1)-M(3) specific antagonist (4-DAMP, 5 nM). However, during a facilitatory stimulation paradigm (10 Hz or 40 Hz, 100 shocks) atropine and pirenzepine, but not 4-DAMP inhibited the release of ACh in bladders from spinal intact rats, indicating an M(1) receptor-mediated facilitation. In spinal cord transected rats, 2 Hz stimulation-induced release was significantly inhibited by atropine or 4-DAMP but not by pirenzepine indicating that a pre-junctional facilitatory mechanism mediated via M(3) muscarinic receptors could be induced by a non-facilitatory stimulation paradigm after spinal injury. In bladders of spinal cord transected rats, 10 Hz stimulation-evoked release of ACh was also inhibited by atropine and 4-DAMP (5 nM) but not by pirenzepine (50 nM). These results indicate that pre-junctional muscarinic receptors at cholinergic nerve endings in the bladder change after chronic spinal cord injury. It appears that low affinity M(1) muscarinic receptors are replaced by high affinity M(3) receptors. This change in modulation of ACh release may partly explain the bladder hyperactivity after chronic spinal cord injury.", 
    "108": "The phosphatidylinositol turnover assay is used widely to measure activation, and inhibition, of G(q)-linked G-protein-coupled receptors. Cells expressing the receptor of interest are labeled by feeding with tritiated myo-inositol. The label is incorporated into cellular phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which, upon agonist binding to the receptor, is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol. In the presence of Li(+), dephosphorylation of IP(3) to inositol is blocked, and the mass of soluble inositol phosphates is a quantitative readout of receptor activation. Current protocols for this assay all involve an anion-exchange chromatography step to separate radiolabeled inositol phosphates from radiolabeled inositol, making the assay cumbersome and difficult to automate. We now describe a scintillation proximity assay to measure soluble inositol phosphate mass in cell extracts, thus obviating the need for the standard chromatography step. The method uses positively charged yttrium silicate beads that bind inositol phosphates, but not inositol. We have used this assay to measure activation of recombinant and endogenous muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and activation of recombinant neuropeptide FF2 receptor coupled to IP(3) production by coexpression of a chimeric G protein. Further, we demonstrate the use and functional validity of this assay in a semiautomated, 384-well format, by characterizing the muscarinic receptor antagonists pirenzepine and atropine.", 
    "109": "This paper presents a summary of time-frequency analysis of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG). It covers in details two major steps: introduction of wavelets and adaptive approximations. Presented studies include time-frequency solutions to several standard research and clinical problems, encountered in analysis of evoked potentials, sleep EEG, epileptic activities, ERD/ERS and pharmaco-EEG. Based upon these results we conclude that the matching pursuit algorithm provides a unified parametrization of EEG, applicable in a variety of experimental and clinical setups. This conclusion is followed by a brief discussion of the current state of the mathematical and algorithmical aspects of adaptive time-frequency approximations of signals.", 
    "110": "Until recently, the therapeutic treatment of breast cancer has been dominated by endocrine-based drugs (oestrogen receptor antagonists, aromatase inhibitors etc.) and conventional cytotoxics (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil etc.). However, the advent of new generation signal transduction inhibitor drugs targeted against the molecular abnormalities of breast cancer (e.g., the antibody trastuzumab, directed against the cERBB2 receptor) has the promise of providing a new era of more tumour selective therapy. Inhibitors of the enzyme farnesyl transferase (FTIs) are now undergoing early-stage clinical trials, including in patients with advanced breast cancer. Although originally developed as inhibitors of RAS signal transduction pathways, it is now apparent that these drugs are better described as prenylation inhibitors; the addition of a 15-carbon prenyl or farnesyl moiety by farnesyl transferase being critical to the function of a number of proteins, including RAS. At least three FTIs are currently undergoing clinical evaluation; R115777 (tipifarnib, Zarnestra), SCH66336 (lonafarnib, Sarasar) and BMS-214662. In terms of their potential use in the chemotherapeutic treatment of advanced breast cancer, a Phase II trial of R115777 (using either continuous or intermittent twice-daily oral dosing) has demonstrated promising activity (approximately 10% partial response rate). Overall, however, the single agent activity of FTIs in various Phase II trials has been rather modest (as well as the above mentioned breast cancer trial, some responses have been seen in patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias). The main dose-limiting toxicities that have been reported are myelosuppression and fatigue and neurotoxicity (with R115777). Two Phase III trials of R115777 in colorectal (versus placebo) and pancreatic (with gemcitabine versus placebo) cancer have failed to show a survival benefit. It is likely that the future clinical direction of FTIs will be as combination therapy, especially with the taxanes, where synergy has been seen in a variety of preclinical studies.", 
    "111": "In the past 10 years, significant progress on the development of new brain-imaging agents for single-photon emission computed tomography has been made. Most of the new radiopharmaceuticals are designed to bind specific neurotransmitter receptor or transporter sites in the central nervous system. Most of the site-specific brain radiopharmaceuticals are labeled with (123)I. Results from imaging of benzodiazepine (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors by [(123)I]iomazenil are useful in identifying epileptic seizure foci and changes of this receptor in psychiatric disorders. Imaging of dopamine D2/D3 receptors ([(123)I]iodobenzamide and [(123)I]epidepride) and transporters [(123)I]CIT (2-beta-carboxymethoxy-3-beta(4-iodophenyl)tropane) and [(123)I]FP-beta-CIT (N-propyl-2-beta-carboxymethoxy-3-beta(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane has proven to be a simple but powerful tool for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. A (99m)Tc-labeled agent, [(99m)Tc]TRODAT (technetium, 2-[[2-[[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3,2,1]oct-2-yl]methyl](2-mercaptoethyl)amino]ethyl]amino] ethanethiolato(3-)]oxo-[1R-(exo-exo)]-), for imaging dopamine transporters in the brain has been successfully applied in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Despite the fact that (123)I radiopharmaceuticals have been widely used in Japan and in Europe, clinical application of (123)I-labeled brain radiopharmaceuticals in the United States is limited because of the difficulties in supplying such agents. Development of (99m)Tc agents will likely extend the application of site-specific brain radiopharmaceuticals for routine applications in aiding the diagnosis and monitoring treatments of various neurologic and psychiatric disorders.", 
    "112": "The effect of age and photoreceptor degeneration on the kainate subtype of glutamate receptors and on the benzodiazepine-sensitive gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors (GABA(A)) in normal and RCS (Royal College of Surgeons) rats were investigated.", 
    "113": "[(3)H]Kainate and [(3)H]flunitrazepam were used as radioligands for kainate and GABA(A)/benzodiazepine()receptors, respectively, using the quantitative receptor autoradiography technique.", 
    "114": "In both normal and RCS rat retina we observed that [(3)Eta]flunitrazepam and [(3)Eta]kainate binding levels were several times higher in inner plexiform layer (IPL) than in outer plexiform layer (OPL) at all four ages studied (P17, P35, P60 and P180). Age-related changes in receptor binding were observed in normal rat retina: [(3)Eta]flunitrazepam binding showed a significant decrease of 25% between P17 and P60 in IPL,and [(3)Eta]kainate binding showed significant decreases between P17 and P35 in both synaptic layers (71% in IPL and 63% in OPL). Degeneration-related changes in benzodiazepine and kainate receptor binding were observed in RCS rat retina. In IPL, [(3)Eta]flunitrazepam and [(3)Eta]kainate binding levels were higher than in normal retina at P35 (by 24% and 86%, respectively). In OPL, [(3)Eta]flunitrazepam binding was higher in RCS than in normal retina on P35 (74%) and also on P60 (62%).", 
    "115": "The results indicate that postnatal changes occur in kainate and benzodiazepine receptor binding sites in OPL and IPL of the rat retina up to 6 months of age. The data also suggest that the receptor binding changes observed in the RCS retina could be a consequence of the primary photoreceptor degeneration.", 
    "116": "Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used widely in the treatment of depression. In contrast to the proconvulsant effect of many antidepressants, fluoxetine has anticonvulsant activity. This property may be due in part to positive modulation of the GABA(A) receptors (GABARs), which mediate most fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. We examined the effect of fluoxetine on the activity of recombinant GABARs transiently expressed in mammalian cells. Fluoxetine increased the response of the receptor to submaximal GABA concentrations but did not alter the maximum current amplitude. Sensitivity did not depend upon the beta- or gamma-subtype composition of the receptor when coexpressed with the alpha(1) subunit. Among the six alpha subtypes, only the alpha(5) subunit conferred reduced sensitivity to fluoxetine. The metabolite norfluoxetine was even more potent than fluoxetine. Mutations at residues in the alpha(5) subunit that alter its sensitivity to zinc or selective benzodiazepine derivatives did not affect potentiation by fluoxetine. This suggests that fluoxetine acts through a novel modulatory site on the GABAR. The direct positive modulation of GABARs by fluoxetine may be a factor in its anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "117": "In the present study, we studied the interaction between serotonergic (5-HTergic) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic systems in the modulation of analgesia from morphine, a mu-opioid agonist, and U50,488, a kappa-opioid agonist. All experiments were performed in mice using the 49 degrees C tail-withdrawal assay. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam, the serotonin synthesis inhibitor, para-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA), and the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, were all found to attenuate morphine and U50,488 analgesia. In each case, the attenuation was itself blocked by treatment with L-5-HTP, a serotonin precursor, bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist or picrotoxin, a GABA(A)-gated chloride channel blocker. Neither L-5-HTP nor the GABA(A) receptor antagonists were found to affect morphine or U50,488 analgesia per se. Thus, these findings indicate that a benzodiazepine-GABAergic agent (diazepam) attenuates opioid analgesia through the serotonergic system, and antiserotonergic agents (8-OH-DPAT, p-CPA) attenuate opioid analgesia through the GABAergic system. The intimate interactions between GABA and serotonin in the present study further suggest that these neurotransmitters work in complex ways together rather than alone in the modulation of opioid analgesia.",

    "121": "Rates of abstinence from illicit drugs increased after treatment among patients from both residential and community (methadone) programmes. Reductions were found for frequency of use of heroin, non-prescribed methadone, benzodiazepines, injecting and sharing of injecting equipment. For most variables, reductions were evident at 1 year with outcomes remaining at about the 1 year level or with further reductions. Crack cocaine and alcohol outcomes at 4-5 years were not significantly different from intake.", 
    "122": "Substantial reductions across a range of problem behaviours were found 4-5 years after patients were admitted to national treatment programmes delivered under day-to-day conditions. The less satisfactory outcomes for heavy drinking and use of crack cocaine suggest the need for services to be modified to tackle these problems more effectively. Despite differences between the United Kingdom and the United States in patient populations and in treatment programmes, there are many similarities between the two countries in outcomes from large-scale, multi-site studies.", 
    "123": "Restless legs syndrome is a common neurological disorder with an estimated prevalence between 2 and 10%. It is characterised by an imperative desire to move the extremities associated with paraesthesias, motor restlessness, worsening of symptoms at rest with at least partial relief by activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. As a consequence, patients suffer from severe sleep disturbances and, less frequently, from daytime sleepiness. The cause of restless legs syndrome remains unknown. It has been divided into idiopathic and symptomatic (secondary, e.g. uraemic restless legs syndrome) forms. Based on pharmacological, neurophysiological and imaging studies it is suggested that it is a disease of the subcortical central nervous system with involvement of the brainstem and spinal chord. Dopaminergic agents are regarded as the first choice of treatment; however, the development of augmentation of symptoms especially under levodopa therapy may be a major problem. Alternative medications are opioids and benzodiazepines. In secondary restless legs syndrome the underlying illness should be treated first, but dopaminergic drugs may also be helpful.", 
    "124": "Examples of reverse turns as recognition motifs in biological systems can be found in high-resolution crystal structures of antibody-peptide complexes. Development of peptidomimetics is often based on replacing the amide backbone of peptides by sugar rings, steroids, benzodiazepines, or other hetero- and carbocycles. In this approach, the chemical scaffold of the peptide backbone can be replaced while retaining activity as long as the pharmacophoric groups of the peptide side chains stay in relatively the same place; in other words, similar functional groups must overlap in space for interaction with critical receptor sites. This study evaluates the potential of metal complexes of chiral pentaazacrowns (PAC) derived by reduction of cyclic pentapeptides as beta-turn mimetics. Due to the limited flexibility of the pendant chiral side groups in these metal complexes, one can potentially elicit information about the receptor-bound conformation from their binding affinities. 11 PAC crystal structures with different substitution patterns complexed with 3 different metals (Mn, Fe, Cd) as a prototypical database of potential side-chain orientations. Complexation with different metals induces subtle differences in the conformations of a particular azacrown scaffold. The lack of parameterization of transition metals for force field calculations precludes a thorough theoretical study. Thus, this study utilizes a simple geometrical comparison between the experimental data for crystalline PAC complexes and the side-chain orientations seen in classic beta-turns. The FOUNDATION program was used to overlap the Calpha-Cbeta vectors of the corresponding ideal beta-turn side-chains to all possible leaving groups of the PAC complexes. When comparing the relative orientations of the chiral side chains, a strong overlap of the bonds (between about 0.1 A to about 0.5 A RMS for 3 residues and up to about 1 A RMS for 4 residues) was observed for many of the molecules. Such metal complexes may lack complete peptidomimetic activity due to the lack of spatial overlap of all four side-chain residues, however, if only three peptide side chains are needed for receptor recognition and/or binding, the metal complexes should show biological activity.", 
    "125": "While marijuana and cocaine are the two most prevalent drugs used among arrestee populations, benzodiazepine use has surpassed that of opiates in several jurisdictions across the United States. Despite this proliferation, few scholarly works have focused on benzodiazepine use among individuals under criminal justice supervision. In the present study, chi-square statistics and logistic regression are utilized to identify significant associations between recent benzodiazepine use (as measured by urinalysis), demographic characteristics, and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among a sample of 862 adult Philadelphia arrestees interviewed in 1997 through the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program. Compared to nonusers, benzodiazepine-positive respondents were more likely to be White, to have used alcohol and barbiturates in the three days preceding the interview, and to have tested positive by urinalysis for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine (PCP). Moreover, logistic regression identified that if an arrestee reported three-day barbiturate use, the odds ratio (OR) of recent benzodiazepine use was more than nine times higher than an arrestee who reported no three-day barbiturate use. Implications for drug surveillance are assessed in light of the current findings.",

All of the evaluated compounds (apart from the oxadiazocine derivatives) showed a week inhibitory activity on recombinant HIV-1 RT from Escherichia coli.", 
    "127": "The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) is a nonbiological liver support method based on the principles of dialysis, filtration, and adsorption. It allows the safe and efficient removal of both albumin-bound and water-soluble toxic metabolites, including ammonia, aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, and related phenolic and indolic products, as well as benzodiazepines. A well-documented effect of the treatment is the improvement of the hemodynamic situation of decompensated chronic patients. Systemic vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral oxygen consumption increased significantly. The degree of hepatic encephalopathy decreased significantly. Increased intracranial pressure could be normalized in both chronic and fulminant liver failure. In three randomized clinical trials significant improvement of survival could be demonstrated. In a model of murine neuronal networks cultured on multi-microelectrode array plates and incubated with plasma from liver failure patients, a normalization of the spike and burst pattern could be observed, if plasma samples from MARS-treated patients before and after treatment were compared. In conclusion, MARS significantly improves central nervous system functions. It can serve as a model for the further investigation of the role of protein-bound substances in hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral hemodynamics.", 
    "128": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful and versatile tool for the investigation of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This nuclear medicine imaging technique produces quantitative images of the distribution of a radiopharmaceutical at one or more times after its administration. Thus, PET images can be used as data in mathematical models of physiologically important processes, including cerebral blood flow, an index of neural activity, or glucose and ammonia metabolism. Using PET, we have demonstrated abnormalities in all of these processes in patients, even though many had only minimal HE. In HE patients we have found increases in the cerebral ammonia metabolic rate, because of hyperammonemia and an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to ammonia and abnormal patterns of blood flow and glucose metabolism. In a recent collaborative study, alterations in the resting glucose metabolic rate were found to have significant correlations with a variety of neuropsychological tests used to detect mild HE including Trailmaking A and B, symbol-digit, and other tests. Activation techniques have not yet been applied to map sites affected by HE, but recent data using the paced serial auditory addition test and an auditory continuous performance task have proven to be sensitive indicators in minimally impaired patients. The full potential of PET to evaluate neurotransmitter function is as yet unrealized.", 
    "129": "The central nervous system, and the basal ganglia in particular, is an important target in manganese neurotoxicity, a disorder producing neurological symptoms similar to that of Parkinson's disease. Increasing evidence suggests that astrocytes are a site of early dysfunction and damage; chronic exposure to manganese leads to selective dopaminergic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and gliosis in basal ganglia structures together with characteristic astrocytic changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. Astrocytes possess a high affinity, high capacity, specific transport system for manganese facilitating its uptake, and sequestration in mitochondria, leading to a disruption of oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, manganese causes a number of other functional changes in astrocytes including an impairment of glutamate transport, alterations of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, production of nitric oxide, and increased densities of binding sites for the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (a class of receptor predominantly localized to mitochondria of astrocytes and involved in oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial proliferation, and neurosteroid synthesis). Such effects can lead to compromised energy metabolism, resulting in altered cellular morphology, production of reactive oxygen species, and increased extracellular glutamate concentration. These consequences may result in impaired astrocytic-neuronal interactions and play a major role in the pathophysiology of manganese neurotoxicity.", 
    "130": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory amino acid in the central nervous system (CNS). Experiments with animal models of HE, and with brain slices or cultured CNS cells treated with ammonia, have documented changes in GABA distribution and transport, and modulation of the responses of both the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex and GABA(B) receptors. Although many of the data point to an enhancement of GABAergic transmission probably contributing to HE, the evidence is not unequivocal. The major weaknesses of the GABA theory are (1) in a vast majority of HE models, there were no alterations of GABA content in the brain tissue and/or extracellular space, indicating that exposure of neurons to GABA may not have been altered, (2) changes in the affinity and capacity of GABA receptor binding were either absent or qualitatively different in HE models of comparable severity and duration, and (3) no sound changes in the GABAergic system parameters were noted in clinical cases of HE. Taurine (Tau) is an amino acid that is thought to mimic GABA function because of its agonistic properties towards GABA(A) receptors, and to contribute to neuroprotection and osmoregulation. These effects require Tau redistribution between the different cell compartments and the extracellular space. Acute treatment with ammonia evokes massive release of radiolabeled or endogenous Tau from CNS tissues in vivo and in vitro, and the underlying mechanism of Tau release differs from the release evoked by depolarizing conditions or hypoosmotic treatment. Subacute or chronic HE, and also long-term treatment of cultured CNS cells in vitro with ammonia, increase spontaneous Tau \"leakage\" from the tissue. This is accompanied by a decreased potassium- or hypoosmolarity-induced release of Tau and often by cell swelling, indicating impaired osmoregulation. In in vivo models of HE, Tau leakage is manifested by its increased accumulation in the extrasynaptic space, which may promote inhibitory neurotransmission and/or cell membrane protection. In chronic HE in humans, decreased Tau content in CNS is thought to be one of the causes of cerebral edema. However, understanding of the impact of the changes in Tau content and transport on the pathogenic mechanisms of HE is hampered by the lack of clear-cut evidence regarding the various roles of Tau in the normal CNS.", 
    "131": "There appears to be a consensus that hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a metabolic encephalopathy with a multifactorial pathogenesis. One of the factors considered to be important in the pathogenesis of HE is ammonia. However, the mechanisms by which ammonia contributes to the manifestations of HE remain poorly defined. Ammonia could be more definitively implicated in the pathogenesis of HE if its effects can be shown to lead to an enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission. In this context the effects of ammonia on the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmitter system may be relevant. Ammonia, at the modestly increased concentrations that commonly occur in precoma HE (0.15 mM-0.75 mM), has been shown to increase GABA-induced chloride current in cultured neurons, probably by modifying the affinity of the GABA(A) receptor for GABA. Comparable ammonia concentrations also enhanced synergistically the binding of a GABA agonist and a benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist to the GABA(A) receptor complex, phenomena which would enhance the neuroinhibitory effects of these ligands. Also, GABA increased the potency of ammonia-induced enhancement of the binding of a BZ agonist to the GABA(A) receptor complex, and brain levels of BZ agonists are elevated in liver failure. In addition, ammonia has been shown to inhibit astrocytic uptake of GABA by 30%-50%, an effect which would increase the synaptic availability of GABA at GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore, increased ammonia concentrations upregulate the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in the outer membrane of astroglial mitochondria, thereby enhancing astrocytic mitochondrial synthesis and release of neurosteroids. Some neurosteroids, for example tetrahydroprogesterone (THP) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), are potent agonists of the GABA(A) receptor complex, on which there are specific binding sites for neurosteroids, that are distinct from those for BZs and barbiturates. Tetrahydroprogesterone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were found to be increased in a mouse model of acute liver failure, and, when THP or THDOC was injected into normal mice, sedation and Alzheimer type II astrocytic changes in the cortex, striatum, and hypothalmus were induced. Each of these direct or indirect effects of ammonia on the GABA neurotransmitter system has the potential of increasing inhibitory neurotransmission, and, hence, contributing to the manifestations of HE.", 
    "132": "Results of neuropathologic, spectroscopic, and neurochemical studies continue to confirm a major role for ammonia in the pathogenesis of the central nervous system complications of both acute and chronic liver failure. Damage to astrocytes characterized by cell swelling (acute liver failure) or Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis (chronic liver failure) can be readily reproduced by acute or chronic exposure of these cells in vitro to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of ammonia. Furthermore, exposure of the brain or cultured astrocytes to ammonia results in similar alterations in expression of genes coding for key astrocytic proteins. Such proteins include the structural glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamate transporters, and peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. Brain-blood ammonia concentration ratios (normally of the order of 2) are increased up to fourfold in liver failure and arterial blood ammonia concentrations are good predictors of cerebral herniation in patients with acute liver failure. Studies using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with chronic liver failure reveal a positive correlation between the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and brain concentrations of the brain ammonia-detoxification product glutamine. Increased intracellular glutamine may be a contributory cause of brain edema in hyperammonemia. Positron emission tomography studies using 13HN3 provide evidence of increased blood-brain ammonia transfer and brain ammonia utilization rates in patients with chronic liver failure. In addition to the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides and antibiotics to reduce gut ammonia production, new approaches to the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by lowering of brain ammonia include the use of L-ornithine-L-aspartate and mild hypothermia.",

These recommendations were posted on the world wide web and presented in open forum at several clinical chemistry and clinical toxicology meetings.", 
    "140": "A menu of important stat serum and urine toxicology tests was prepared for clinical laboratories who provide clinical toxicology services. For drugs-of-abuse intoxication, most ED physicians do not rely on results of urine drug testing for emergent management decisions. This is in part because immunoassays, although rapid, have limitations in sensitivity and specificity and chromatographic assays, which are more definitive, are more labor-intensive. Ethyl alcohol is widely tested in the ED, and breath testing is a convenient procedure. Determinations made within the ED, however, require oversight by the clinical laboratory. Testing for toxic alcohols is needed, but rapid commercial assays are not available. The laboratory must provide stat assays for acetaminophen, salicylates, co-oximetry, cholinesterase, iron, and some therapeutic drugs, such as lithium and digoxin. Exposure to other heavy metals requires laboratory support for specimen collection but not for emergent testing.", 
    "141": "Improvements are needed for immunoassays, particularly for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, opioids, and tricyclic antidepressants. Assays for new drugs of abuse must also be developed to meet changing abuse patterns. As no clinical laboratory can provide services to meet all needs, the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry Committee recommends establishment of regional centers for specialized toxicology testing.", 
    "142": "Continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWSS) is a well-known EEG pattern that can be associated with cognitive and behavioural deterioration. We present the long-term neuropsychological follow-up and nosological considerations of five patients who developed CSWSS during childhood. All five of our patients presented CSWSS, although the duration and severity of this pattern varied. The outcome was of three basic types: acquired frontal dementia, language deficits and normal. Four of our patients were initially diagnosed with Landau-Kleffner syndrome but have had markedly diverse outcomes in terms of the severity and type of compromise. Our data suggest that the initial diagnosis, according to current nosological categories, has almost no prognostic significance, while the length and the age of onset of CSWSS, the site of epileptiform activity and the individual neuropsychological profile are more useful for identifying the long-term outcome of patients with CSWSS.", 
    "143": "Exposure to hostile conditions initiates responses organized to enhance the probability of survival. These coordinated responses, known as stress responses, are composed of alterations in behavior, autonomic function and the secretion of multiple hormones. The activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis plays a pivotal role in the stress response. Neuroendocrine components activated by stressors include the increased secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla, the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and vasopressin from parvicellular neurons into the portal circulation, and seconds later, the secretion of pituitary adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), leading to secretion of glucocorticoids by the adrenal gland. Corticotropin-releasing factor coordinates the endocrine, autonomic, behavioral and immune responses to stress and also acts as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the amygdala, dorsal raphe nucleus, hippocampus and locus coeruleus, to integrate brain multi-system responses to stress. This review discussed the role of classical mediators of the stress response, such as corticotropin-releasing factor, vasopressin, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and catecholamines. Also discussed are the roles of other neuropeptides/neuromodulators involved in the stress response that have previously received little attention, such as substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y and cholecystokinin. Anxiolytic drugs of the benzodiazepine class and other drugs that affect catecholamine, GABA(A), histamine and serotonin receptors have been used to attenuate the neuroendocrine response to stressors. The neuroendocrine information for these drugs is still incomplete; however, they are a new class of potential antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs that offer new therapeutic approaches to treating anxiety disorders. The studies described in this review suggest that multiple brain mechanisms are responsible for the regulation of each hormone and that not all hormones are regulated by the same neural circuits. In particular, the renin-angiotensin system seems to be regulated by different brain mechanisms than the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. This could be an important survival mechanism to ensure that dysfunction of one neurotransmitter system will not endanger the appropriate secretion of hormones during exposure to adverse conditions. The measurement of several hormones to examine the mechanisms underlying the stress response and the effects of drugs and lesions on these responses can provide insight into the nature and location of brain circuits and neurotransmitter receptors involved in anxiety and stress.", 
    "144": "Fear (i.e., decreased percentage time spent on open-arm exploration) in the elevated plus-maze can be potentiated by prior inescapable stressor exposure, but not by escapable stress. The use of fear-potentiated plus-maze behaviour has several advantages as compared to more traditional animal models of anxiety. (a) In contrast to the traditional (spontaneous) elevated plus-maze, which measures innate fear of open spaces, fear-potentiated plus-maze behaviour reflects an enhanced anxiety state (allostatic state). This \"state anxiety\" can be defined as an unpleasant emotional arousal in face of threatening demands or dangers. A cognitive appraisal of threat is a prerequisite for the experience of this type of emotion. (b) Depending on the stressor used (e.g., fear of shock, predator odour, swim stress, restraint, social defeat, predator stress (cat)), this enhanced anxiety state can last from 90 min to 3 weeks. Stress effects are more severe when rats are isolated in comparison to group housing. (c) Drugs can be administered in the absence of the original stressor and after stressor exposure. As a consequence, retrieval mechanisms are not affected by drug treatment. (d) Fear-potentiated plus-maze behaviour is sensitive to proven/putative anxiolytics and anxiogenics which act via mechanisms related to the benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, but it is also sensitive to corticotropin-releasing receptor antagonists and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor agonists/antagonists complex (high predictive validity). (e) Fear-potentiated plus-maze behaviour is very robust, and experiments can easily be replicated in other labs. (f) Fear-potentiated plus-maze behaviour can be measured both in males and females. (g) Neural mechanisms involved in contextual fear conditioning, fear potentiation and state anxiety can be studied.Thus, fear-potentiated plus-maze behaviour may be a valuable measure in the understanding of neural mechanisms involved in the development of anxiety disorders and in the search for novel anxiolytics. Finally, the involvement of corticotropin-releasing factor and corticosteroid-corticotropin-releasing factor interactions in the production of fear-potentiated plus-maze behaviour are discussed.", 
    "145": "The post-stimuli anticipatory vocalisations that follow stressful and painful conditions are suggested as a quantitative measure of the emotional state of fear and anxiety in animal models. Adult rats emit characteristic 22-kHz ultrasound vocalisations consisting of 20-30 kHz calls with a mean duration of 300-600 ms as response to aversive stimuli (e.g. inescapable electric footshock, acoustic or air-puff stimuli, agonistic encounter or withdrawal from treatment with drugs of abuse). The vocalisations are accompanied by defensive submissive behaviour and signal a refractory, socially withdrawn or helpless state. Furthermore, brain structures that are involved in the mediation of anxiety-like behaviour, e.g. the dorsal periaqueductal grey and cortical areas, are also important for modulation of ultrasonic vocalisation. Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam, inhibit shock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation although the active doses are generally close to those that produce sedation and muscle relaxation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants that preferentially enhance serotonergic neurotransmission inhibit footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The 5-HT(2) receptor antagonistic properties of fluoxetine may explain why only partial inhibition is achieved. The biphasic dose-response curve of the racemic drug, citalopram, may perhaps be ascribed to an attenuating effect of R-citalopram. Tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. imipramine, and antidepressants that preferentially enhance catecholaminergic neurotransmission, e.g. reboxetine and venlafaxine, are inactive. Classical antipsychotics like haloperidol have no or a weak inhibitory effect. Serotonin plays a major role in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation, and in particular 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2) receptors are found to have a prominent role. Different serotonergic pathways are likely to be involved in the mediation of the anxiolytic-like response, e.g. the pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus through the medial forebrain bundle to the amygdala and frontal cortex mediating conditioned/learned anxiety and another pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the periaqueductal grey mediating unconditioned/fight flight anxiety. Dopamine D(2) receptor agonists are potent inhibitors of footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The role of dopamine D(1) receptors and adrenoceptors remains to be further elucidated. Several other neurotransmitters are involved in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation, e.g. acetylcholine, histamine and glutamate. There is also a need for further studies of how changes in stress-axis function may modulate ultrasonic vocalisation and for studies of the effects of chronic drug treatment on ultrasonic vocalisation.", 
    "146": "When mammals, including man, are confronted with a stressful event, their core body temperature rises, stress-induced hyperthermia. In mice, the stress-induced hyperthermia procedure has been developed to measure antistress or anxiolytic-like effects of psychoactive drugs. Group-housed and singly housed versions of the stress-induced hyperthermia generate comparable results. Because the number of animals needed to perform an experiment is much lower in the singly housed versus the group-housed procedure, the former is the test of choice for pharmacological testing. A typical stress-induced hyperthermia test starts with an injection 60 min before the first rectal temperature measurement (T(1)), followed by a second temperature measurement (T(2)) 10-15 min later. The difference DeltaT (=T(2)-T(1)) is the stress-induced hyperthermia. The procedure also measures the intrinsic activity of drugs on the basal body temperature and DeltaT is relatively independent from the intrinsic temperature effects of drugs. Anxiolytic drugs (benzodiazepines, 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists, alcohol) reduce DeltaT suggestive of anxiolytic-like effects. Because the parameter measured for anxiety in the stress-induced hyperthermia procedure is not dependent on locomotor activity, like in almost all other anxiety tests, the stress-induced hyperthermia procedure is an attractive addition to tests in the anxiety field. Because the stress-induced hyperthermia is also present with a comparable pharmacological profile in females, this procedure has a wide species and gender validity. The procedure was applied in various genetically modified mice [5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor knockout (KO) mice and corticotropin-releasing hormone overexpressing (CRH-OE) mice] to study phenotypic influences of the various mutations on aspects of anxiety. The stress-induced hyperthermia test in singly housed male and female mice appears a useful and extremely simple test to measure effects of drugs on certain aspects of anxiety or to help to determine phenotypic differences in mutant mice.", 
    "147": "The Mouse Defense Test Battery was developed from tests of defensive behaviors in rats, reflecting earlier studies of both acute and chronic responses of laboratory and wild rodents to threatening stimuli and situations. It measures flight, freezing, defensive threat and attack, and risk assessment in response to an unconditioned predator stimulus, as well as pretest activity and postthreat (conditioned) defensiveness to the test context. Factor analyses of these indicate four factors relating to cognitive and emotional aspects of defense, flight, and defensiveness to the test context. In the Mouse Defense Test Battery, GABA(A)-benzodiazepine anxiolytics produce consistent reductions in defensive threat/attack and risk assessment, while panicolytic and panicogenic drugs selectively reduce and enhance, respectively, flight. Effects of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine, serotonin, and neuropeptide ligands in the Mouse Defense Test Battery are reviewed. This review suggests that the Mouse Defense Test Battery is a sensitive and appropriate tool for preclinical evaluation of drugs potentially effective against defense-related disorders such as anxiety and panic.", 
    "148": "The light/dark test is based on the innate aversion of rodents to brightly illuminated areas and on the spontaneous exploratory behaviour of rodents in response to mild stressors, that is, novel environment and light. The test apparatus consists of a small dark safe compartment (one third) and a large illuminated aversive compartment (two thirds). The test was developed with male mice. The strain, weight and age may be crucial factors. The extent to which an anxiolytic compound can facilitate exploratory activity depends on the baseline level in the control group. Differences between the type and severity of external stressors might account for the variable results reported by different laboratories. The light/dark test may be useful to predict anxiolytic-like or anxiogenic-like activity in mice. Transitions have been reported to be an index of activity-exploration because of habituation over time, and the time spent in each compartment to be a reflection of aversion. Classic anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) as well as the newer anxiolytic-like compounds (e.g. serotonergic drugs or drugs acting on neuropeptide receptors) can be detected using this paradigm. It has the advantages of being quick and easy to use, without requiring the prior training of animals.", 
    "149": "The open field is a very popular animal model of anxiety-like behavior. An overview of the literature on the action elicited by effective or putative anxiolytics in animal subjected to this procedure indicates that classical treatments such as benzodiazepine receptor full agonists or 5-HT(1A) receptor full or partial agonists elicit an anxiolytic-like effect in this procedure in most cases (approximately 2/3). However, compounds (triazolobenzodiazepines such as adinazolam and alprazolam, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) that have a different spectrum of therapeutic efficacy in anxiety disorders such as panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder were poorly effective as anxiolytics in the open field test, suggesting that this paradigm may not model features of anxiety disorders. The procedure is also relevant for the study of compounds endowed with anxiogenic effects, as such effects were detected after treatments with benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists or with corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor agonists.", 
    "150": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide (CART-(55-102)) is involved in the suppression of food intake. We now report that CART-(55-102) is involved in anxiety in rodents. Intracerebroventricularly administered CART-(55-102) as well as intraperitoneal administration of N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142), a selective GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, reduced time spent in the open arms in the elevated plus-maze task in mice. CART-(55-102)-induced anxiogenic-like behavior in this task was attenuated by widely prescribed anxiolytics such as diazepam and buspirone. Likewise, CART-(55-102) and FG-7142 significantly reduced social interaction in mice. Both diazepam and buspirone significantly reversed CART-(55-102)-induced anxiogenic-like behavior in social interaction tests. By contrast, another biologically active CART peptide, CART-(62-102), was without effect in the elevated plus-maze task in mice. Moreover, intracerebroventricular administration of CART-(55-102) markedly increased the firing rate of locus coeruleus neurons in single unit recording in anesthetized rats. As CART-(55-102) produced anxiety-like effects in rodents, this peptide may possibly be involved in anxiety and stress-related behavior.", 
    "151": "Prolonged benzodiazepine use is a widespread phenomenon in medical practice. In the present article, we argue that psychological models may contribute to our understanding of benzodiazepine use. This study examined variables derived from the theory of planned behaviour and the health belief model in relation to the length of benzodiazepine use. Data were collected from a sample of all benzodiazepine users with a request for this medicine in the only pharmacy in a Dutch community (N=467). Determinants of the length of benzodiazepine use were analysed separately for inexperienced and experienced users using structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses. For both groups, results showed that the intention to use benzodiazepines was a predictor of length of use. Attitudes towards benzodiazepine use had an indirect influence on length of use, through intentions. Furthermore, a positive attitude toward using benzodiazepines was related to the perceived norm of the prescriber. Experienced users were more inclined to consume benzodiazepines when they had less control over drug taking. In this group, the belief that benzodiazepine use leads to dependence was associated with less control over drug taking and a high intention to use the drug. In addition, older experienced users reported a higher intention to use the drug. For inexperienced users, the perceived attitude of the prescriber towards use of the medicine was a strong determinant. Finally, results of SEM-analyses showed that the model accounted for far more variance in behaviour for experienced users (67%), than for inexperienced users (18%).",

    "156": "Traditionally it has been shown that anti epileptic drugs have side effects which cause alterations particularly in behaviour and cognition, independently from that due to the epilepsy itself. This has caused great controversy. Some studies have informed that many of these drug effects are caused by the epilepsy rather than the drugs themselves. It is possible that the drugs may cause changes in behaviour and cognition, but these also improve when the seizures are brought under control. The main problem therefore is to determine the methodology which would take these variables into account, since many studies do not follow a standard methodology: the various drugs and neuropsychological aspects are compared using a large variety of tests.", 
    "157": "At the present time, using suitable methodology, and double blind randomized controlled trials, it has been found that the secondary effects on cognition and behaviour are not as severe as had been thought. The drug causing most alterations is phenobarbitone and some benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, alter cognitive function to a greater degree. With the newer anti epileptic drugs improvement in cognition has been observed due to its mechanism of action and to control of the epilepsy."
