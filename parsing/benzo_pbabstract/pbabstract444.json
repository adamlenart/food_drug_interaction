    "0": "A polypeptide of M(r) 36,000 (36 kDa) was isolated from detergent-solubilized membrane fractions of mammalian brain on a benzodiazepine affinity column utilized for the purification of the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor protein, followed by preparative gel electrophoresis. Partial protein sequence for two fragments of the 36-kDa polypeptide allowed the isolation of cDNA clones from a rat hippocampal library. An open reading frame coding a sequence of 295 amino acid residues containing the two probe peptide sequences with minor differences, and a putative N-terminal signal peptide of 25 residues was found. Hydropathy index revealed no regions of alpha-helix suitable for membrane spanning, but several areas of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues consistent with beta-strands. The sequence of this brain protein was 24% identical to that of a yeast mitochondrial protein, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and over 70% identical with the VDAC from human B lymphocytes. The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor/36-kDa preparation purified on benzodiazepine affinity column has channel-forming activity in lipid bilayer membranes that is virtually identical to VDAC isolated from mitochondria of various sources, indicating that the 36-kDa protein is a new member of the VDAC family of proteins. An antiserum raised against the purified 36-kDa polypeptide was able to precipitate [3H]muscimol binding activity, indicating a tight association with the GABAA receptor protein in vitro and copurification on the benzodiazepine affinity column due to this association. Further studies are needed to determine whether such an association occurs in vivo.", 
    "1": "The dopamine innervation of the prefrontal cortex can be differentiated from other telencephalic dopamine projection fields by its sensitivity to stress. The stress-induced activation of the mesoprefrontal cortical dopamine system can be blocked by pretreatment with benzodiazepines. A group of neuroactive steroids that modulate GABA-induced chloride flux through means distinct from that of the benzodiazepines has recently been identified. Intraventricular administration of the neuroactive steroid 3 alpha,21-dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnane-20-one resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in dopamine metabolites in the prefrontal cortex, but not in mesolimbic or striatal sites; sedative effects were not observed. Moreover, the neuroactive steroid selectively attenuated the stress-induced activation of the mesoprefrontal cortical dopamine system. These data suggest that neuroactive steroids may function as endogenous anxiolytic agents.", 
    "2": "We have recently demonstrated that ethanol and longer-chain alcohols (n-alcohols) enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced chloride currents before desensitization takes place. The potencies of n-alcohols increase with lengthening of the carbon chain. We now report that n-alcohols induce chloride currents by themselves in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in primary culture. The whole cell variation of the patch clamp techniques was used to record currents as induced by external application of alcohols and other test compounds. Ethanol, n-butanol, n-hexanol and n-octanol induced inward currents with their potencies increasing in that order. The potencies were approximately one order of magnitude less than those to augment GABA-induced currents. The maximum amplitudes of currents induced by the alcohols were less than those produced by GABA. The n-octanol-induced currents were carried largely by chloride ions because the reversal potentials were changed according to the Nernst chloride potential as the internal chloride concentration was changed. Bicuculline and picrotoxin suppressed the n-octanol-induced current, and chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital augmented the n-octanol-induced current. Therefore, the alcohol-induced chloride currents flow through the chloride channels associated with the GABAA receptors. When applied after the GABA-induced current was desensitized to a lower level, n-octanol suppressed rather than augmented the current. Thus, n-alcohols mimic barbiturates in augmenting the GABA-induced currents and in generating chloride currents by themselves. These actions of both agents may play a role in causing anxiolytic, sedative and/or anesthetic effects.", 
    "3": "A non-isotopic receptor assay for benzodiazepine drugs was developed using a biotin-labeled ligand, biotin-1012S. Biotinylated bovine serum albumin (biotin-BSA) was immobilized onto the wall of microtiter plate wells by simple adsorption. Avidin peroxidase conjugate could be extracted from solution owing to its strong interaction with biotin. The amount of avidin peroxidase taken up on the wall was then determined by measuring the enzyme activity. The competition between immobilized biotin on the wall and free biotin for avidin provided the basis for a solid-phase avidin-biotin binding assay. By this binding assay, not only biotin but also biotin-1012S could be measured sensitively. Because 1012S is a ligand with high affinity to benzodiazepine receptors, biotin-1012S could be utilized as a probe ligand for a non-isotopic receptor assay. Based upon the competition between biotin-1012S and various benzodiazepine drugs for the receptor binding sites, a non-isotopic receptor assay was demonstrated.", 
    "4": "The antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of alprazolam were compared to those of desipramine, diazepam and buspirone in the forced swim test. Subchronic alprazolam induced a reduction in immobility similar to that of desipramine in 'non-pretested' and 'pretested' rats. In 'non-pretested' rats, the anti-immobility effect of desipramine was potentiated by diazepam and alprazolam, given before subchronic desipramine, while the anti-immobility effect of subchronic alprazolam was counteracted by diazepam. Diazepam, administered before the pretest session, counteracted, 24 h later, the anti-immobility effect of subchronic desipramine and alprazolam; alprazolam counteracted the anti-immobility effect of alprazolam but not of desipramine, buspirone at the highest doses tested potentiated the anti-immobility effect of subchronic desipramine but not of alprazolam. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that the GABA/benzodiazepine/Cl complex is directly implicated in the action of antidepressants and that systems other than the GABA system are involved in the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of alprazolam.", 
    "5": "Anxiolytic agents disinhibit suppressed behaviors in rodents in preclinical models of anxiety such as the non-conditioned social interaction and elevated plus maze assays and the conditioned conflict Cook and Davidson procedure. The (+) and (-) enantiomers of (+/-)-3-amino-1-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone (HA-966) have been resolved and revealed that R-(+)-HA-966 significantly disinhibits both non-conditioned and conditioned suppressed behavior similar to the benzodiazepine diazepam, while the S-(-) enantiomer was devoid of anxiolytic activity and only produced behavioral sedation. Furthermore, R-(+)-HA-966 lacked side-effects in rodents commonly associated with the administration of benzodiazepines such as motor incoordination and ataxia, significant interactions with ethanol, and amnesia. These data suggest that R-(+)-HA-966, an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine/NMDA receptor site, was anxioselective and lacked some of the side-effects associated with benzodiazepine anxiolytics.", 
    "6": "The affinity of strychnocarpine and related beta-carbolines for serotonin, benzodiazepine, tryptamine, opiate and GABA receptors in rat brain was studied. Strychnocarpine showed a low to very low affinity for all the receptors tested. The weak binding to tryptamine receptors might explain part of the tremorigenic effects found earlier in the in vivo studies.",

    "8": "Two groups of three healthy adult male volunteers without histories of sedative or other drug abuse participated in 15-day residential studies. Each day consisted of a private work period (10 AM to 4:30 PM), during which subjects participated in traditional laboratory performance tasks, and a social period (5 to 11:30 PM), during which subjects had access to recreational activities available under social or private conditions. Tobacco cigarettes and food were available throughout each day (9 AM to 12 PM). Diazepam (5 or 10 mg/70 kg) or placebo was administered orally twice daily in alternating three-consecutive-day intervals. Dosing order varied between groups. Diazepam had no effect on the total amount of time subjects spent in social conditions; however, the low dose increased verbal interaction, while the high dose decreased verbal interaction. Both doses disrupted performance on a second-order repeated-acquisition task but produced no effects on the other performance measures. Five of six subjects increased caloric intake following at least one dose, with the largest increases observed in subjects with the lowest baseline intake. Increases in subject reports of dose \"Potency\" and \"Sedated\" were also observed following the high dose. Diazepam doses routinely used in clinical settings influenced a variety of behaviors that are observed in the natural ecology, but not performance on accepted laboratory tasks.", 
    "9": "The effects of bound fatty acids and nonenzymatic glycosylation (NEG) on tryptophan binding to human serum albumin (HSA) were examined utilizing a rate of dialysis technique. HSA with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 mol of palmitate bound per mol of HSA was glycosylated in vitro to a level exceeding that seen in diabetes. NEG was not inhibited by fatty acids, suggesting that Lys-525, the primary site for NEG, is not an essential component of the principal sites for long-chain fatty acid binding to HSA. Scatchard analysis of binding data showed an expected fatty acid dependent decrease in the number of available tryptophan binding sites, but showed that fatty acids did not affect tryptophan affinity. The binding data failed to show an effect of NEG on tryptophan binding. The lack of inhibition of tryptophan binding by NEG suggests that drug-binding Site II, the indole/benzodiazepine site, is resistant to both NEG and to any conformational changes in HSA which may occur with NEG. These data suggest that elevated plasma free tryptophan and the resulting altered serotonin metabolism seen in diabetes are independent of increased NEG and likely result from diabetic hyperlipidemia.", 
    "10": "This experiment examined the effects of diazepam (DZP) on acquisition and retention of an inhibitory avoidance response by rats with excitotoxic-induced lesions of central (CE), lateral (LAT), or basolateral (BL) amygdala nuclei. Sham-operated and lesioned rats received i.p. injections of DZP (2.0 mg per kg of body weight) 30 min before training in a continuous multiple-trial inhibitory avoidance task. Retention was tested 48 h later. Acquisition was not impaired by the lesions or the DZP. Retention was impaired in animals with CE and LAT lesions in comparison with sham-operated controls. DZP impaired retention in the sham-operated controls as well as CE- and LAT-lesioned animals but did not affect retention in animals with BL lesions. These findings indicate that the DZP-induced anterograde amnesia for inhibitory avoidance training is mediated through influences involving the BL amygdala nucleus.", 
    "11": "In central nervous system gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibits neuronal activity by acting on GABA type A (GABAA) receptors. These heterooligomeric integral membrane proteins include a GABA-gated Cl- channel and various allosteric modulatory sites where endogenous modulators and anxiolytic drugs act to regulate GABA action. In vivo, various anxiolytic drugs exhibit a wide range of variability in their modulatory efficacy and potency of GABA action. For instance, bretazenil modulatory efficacy is much lower than that of diazepam. Such low efficacy could be due either to a preferential modulation of specific GABAA receptor subtypes or to a low modulatory efficacy at every GABAA receptor subtype. To address these questions we studied drug-induced modifications of GABA-activated Cl- currents in native GABAA receptors of cortical neurons in primary cultures and in recombinant GABAA receptors transiently expressed in transformed human embryonic kidney cells (293) after transfection with cDNAs encoding different molecular forms of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of GABAA receptors. In cortical neurons the efficacy of bretazenil was lower than that of diazepam, whereas the potency of the two drugs was similar. In cells transfected with gamma 2 subunits and various molecular forms of alpha and beta subunits bretazenil efficacy was always lower than that of diazepam. However, in cells transfected with gamma 1 or gamma 3 subunits and various forms of alpha and beta subunits the efficacy of both diazepam and bretazenil was lower and always of similar magnitude. When bretazenil and diazepam were applied together to GABAA receptors including a gamma 2 subunit, the action of diazepam was curtailed in a manner related to the dose of bretazenil.", 
    "12": "The mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR) has been solubilized with retention of reversible ligand binding, and the associated subunits were characterized. mBzR comprises immunologically distinct protein subunits of 18-, 30-, and 32-kDa. The 18-kDa protein is labeled by the isoquinoline carboxamide mBzR ligand [3H]PK14105, whereas the 30- and 32-kDa subunits are labeled by the benzodiazepine (Bz) ligands [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]AHN-086. Selective antibodies and reagents identify the 32- and 30-kDa proteins as the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the adenine nucleotide carrier (ADC), respectively. While isoquinoline carboxamide and Bz ligands target different subunits, they interact allosterically, as the binding of Bz and isoquinoline carboxamide ligands is mutually competitive at low nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, eosin-5-maleimide and mercuric chloride inhibit [3H]PK11195 binding to the intact receptor via sulfhydryl groups that are present in ADC. VDAC and ADC, outer and inner mitochondrial membrane channel proteins, respectively, together with the 18-kDa subunit, may comprise mBzR at functionally important transport sites at the junction of two mitochondrial membranes.", 
    "13": "Electrophysiological techniques and Xenopus oocytes were used to study the expression of neurotransmitter receptors encoded by mRNAs isolated from three human glioma cell lines. Oocytes injected with mRNAs from two glioblastoma cell lines did not show electrical responses to the various neurotransmitters tested. In contrast, oocytes injected with mRNA from an astrocytoma cell line (R-111) acquired acetylcholine and glutamate receptors as well as a small number of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Acetylcholine elicited oscillatory Cl- currents that were abolished by muscarinic antagonists. The muscarinic receptors are coupled to the inositol phosphate-Ca2+ receptor-channel coupling system. Glutamate and its analogs kainate, quisqualate, and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid induced smooth currents. The non-NMDA responses were potently blocked by 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3 dione. Our results show that human astrocytoma cells contain mRNAs coding for functional acetylcholine and glutamate receptors that have properties similar to those of neurons. In contrast, human glioblastoma cells lacked those mRNAs. These differences might be useful for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.", 
    "14": "Postmortem cerebellar and frontal cortical membrane homogenates from human alcoholics, control subjects without neurological or psychiatric illnesses, and rats that chronically drank alcohol were studied to determine the binding characteristics of an imidazobenzodiazepine, [3H]Ro 15-4513. This ligand binds to classical gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptors, as well as to a \"diazepam-insensitive\" site associated with the GABAA receptor complex in the cerebellar granule cell layer. There were no differences in the density of the binding sites between alcoholics and their controls, between alcohol-drinking AA rats that had a choice between 10% alcohol or water for about 10 weeks and their controls, or between Wistar rats that had been given 20% alcohol as their only fluid for 4 months and their controls, which were pair-fed isocalorically with sucrose. The affinity for the cerebellar binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 was higher in the alcoholics than the controls. No differences were observed in the frontocortical binding. No affinity differences were observed in the rat models. There were no differences between the groups in the characteristics of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to human cerebellum in the presence of micromolar diazepam, thus revealing the diazepam-insensitive binding. When this component was subtracted from the total cerebellar binding, to reveal the diazepam sensitive binding, both the KD and Bmax were lower in the alcoholic than the control group. The binding of [3H]muscimol, a GABAA agonist, tended to be higher in the frontal cortices of alcoholics; a similar trend for greater effects was observed in the alcoholics for the GABA inhibition of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding. These results suggest that no drastic changes occur through chronic alcohol abuse in the numbers of cerebellar and frontocortical benzodiazepine receptors in humans and rodent models; however, the data indicate that the alcoholics have either acquired or innate differences in classical benzodiazepine recognition sites of the cerebellum and in the coupling of these sites to GABAA sites in the frontal cortex, without any differences in cerebellar granule cell-specific diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites.", 
    "15": "The effects of alprazolam (ALP), a triazolobenzodiazepine with high affinity for \"central\" benzodiazepine receptors, were examined on several parameters of immune function in mice. NK, MLR, and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation were all significantly increased 2 hr after administration of low doses (0.02-1.0 mg/kg) of ALP. Twenty four hr later, similar but less robust immunoenhancing effects were observed. These measures of immune functions were not affected by higher doses of ALP (5-10 mg/kg). The immunoenhancing effects of ALP did not appear related to serum corticosterone levels. These and other findings demonstrate that the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex can bidirectionally modulate immune function.",

    "21": "BZD use declined precipitously from 25 percent of psychotropic drug orders to 10 percent six months after implementation of the program. The decline in BZD use was accompanied by an increase in the number of orders for alternative psychotropic agents. Although 22 percent of the patients previously receiving BZDs were discontinued from these drugs, more than half of these patients were switched to alternative therapy, including tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs. The majority of patients who discontinued BZDs did so without tapering of the dosage; however, few experienced minor withdrawal symptoms and no patient experienced seizures or required hospitalization following discontinuation. The risk of falls, hospital admission for any reason, or combined events was not significantly altered despite a reduction in BZD use. There was a trend, however, for a reduction in falls after implementation of the program.", 
    "22": "This study documents that psychotropic drug prescribing patterns were significantly affected by the triplicate prescription program. BZD use declined; however, use of alternative psychotropic drugs increased. Despite changes in psychotropic prescribing patterns, we found no significant risk of adverse events. Further study to evaluate the long-term effect of alternative psychotropic drugs is necessary.", 
    "23": "Bilateral infusion of the GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol into the basal forebrain was previously found to impair visual conditional discrimination performance in rats. In order to examine whether the GABAergic input into the basal forebrain is active during performance of this task, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (15, 25, 40 micrograms/0.5 microliters/hemisphere) was bilaterally infused. Surprisingly, chlordiazepoxide did not affect performance. The impact of this result for the understanding of basal forebrain GABAergic functions is discussed.", 
    "24": "We examined the role of CCK in bombesin-induced pancreatic growth in rats using the CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. Rats (155 +/- 1 g, 8-10 per group) received subcutaneous injections every 8 h for 5 days with bombesin (0.6, 1.7 and 5 nmol/kg) or bombesin in combination with L-364,718 (1 mg/kg). After 5 days the pancreas was removed and pancreatic weight, protein content, DNA, amylase and chymotrypsin contents were determined. Bombesin produced a significant increase (48-475%) of pancreatic weight, tissue contents of protein, DNA, amylase and chymotrypsinogen (F = 82, P less than 0.001). When a large dose of bombesin (5 nmol/kg) was combined with L-364,718 a significant inhibition (up to 70%) of all tissue parameters was observed (P less than 0.001). L-364,718 did not affect the growth response to a small dose of bombesin (0.6 nmol/kg). Plasma CCK levels 15 min after a single injection of bombesin (0.6, 1.7 and 5 nmol/kg) were significantly increased in response to the 5 nmol/kg dose (2.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.4 +/- 0.8 pM, F = 6.9, P less than 0.01). No increases of CCK plasma levels were found in response to the 0.6 and 1.7 nmol/kg doses of bombesin, corresponding to the lack of effects of L-364,718 on growth parameters at these doses. Measuring the time-course of CCK plasma levels after a single injection of 5 nmol/kg bombesin revealed an increase from basal values of 1.4 +/- 0.3 pM to maximal levels of 3.5 +/- 0.5 pM after 15 min (F = 7.1, P less than 0.001). Values returned to basal after 60 min. These results suggest that low doses of bombesin act directly at the acinar cell or through release of non-CCK growth factors whereas high doses of bombesin act in part through CCK release.", 
    "25": "Competitive binding assays were performed in rat spinal cord membranes at 0 degrees C against [3H]Ro15-1788. The displacement curves of Ro15-1788 and alpidem produced pseudo-Hill slopes of 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. In addition, 5-10% of the specifically bound [3H]Ro15-1788 could not be displaced by greater than 100 microM of alpidem. These two pieces of evidence strongly suggest the presence of at least three central benzodiazepine binding sites in the spinal cord.", 
    "26": "The effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone and ipsapirone on wheel-running activity in hamsters were investigated in comparison with those of GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and benzodiazepine triazolam. Intraperitoneal administration of 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, ipsapirone, muscimol and triazolam at circadian time (CT) 8 (CT 12; onset of activity) induced a significant phase advance of wheel-running activity under constant light conditions. However, administration of these drugs at other CT points did not induce phase changes. The administration of trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, at CT8 produced a small phase advance. The phase advance induced by 8-OH-DPAT was blocked by pretreatment with (-)-pindolol, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and SM3997 accelerated the rate of re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance in the light-dark cycle. These observations suggest that 5-HT1A receptors in the brain participate in the regulation of the circadian rhythm of wheel-running activity in hamsters.", 
    "27": "The effects of diazepam and other agonists of central or peripheral benzodiazepine receptors were studied on the contractile action of adenosine, 2-chloroadenosine and R-PIA (N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine) on the guinea-pig isolated trachea. These effects were compared to those of dipyridamole. Diazepam 10(-7) to 10(-5) M potentiated the efficacy of adenosine; the maximal contractile effect of adenosine (% vs. acetylcholine 10(-3) M) was 20.4 +/- 4.2 (n = 21) in control conditions and 45.5 +/- 3.7 (n = 6; P less than 0.001) in the presence of diazepam 10(-5) M. Ro5-4864 (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) or alpidem (10(-7) to 10(-5) M), both agonists of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, potentiated the contractile effects of adenosine to the same extent as diazepam. Clonazepam and zopiclone, both agonists of central benzodiazepine receptors, did not modify these effects. Antagonists of central (flumazenil) or peripheral (RP 52028) benzodiazepine receptors had no influence on the interaction between diazepam or Ro5-4864 and adenosine. Conversely, dipyridamole significantly reduced (10(-7) M) or suppressed (10(-6) M) the contractile effects of adenosine. The contractile effects of 2-chloroadenosine and R-PIA were weakly affected in presence of high concentrations of diazepam and dipyridamole. Epithelium removal potentiated the contractile effect of adenosine on the guinea-pig isolated trachea and increased the potentiating effect of diazepam. It is concluded that benzodiazepines and related compounds can potentiate the contractile effect of adenosine on the guinea-pig isolated trachea through the activation of a peripheral receptor for the benzodiazepines and the resulting inhibition of adenosine uptake.", 
    "28": "The effects of a novel benzodiazepine derivative, Ro 16-6028 on rat brain dopamine system were examined under stress and non-stress conditions. Thirty minutes restraint stress increased dopamine synthesis in two dopamine neuron regions, prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbence. Ro 16-6028 inhibited potently dopamine synthesis in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum in dose dependent manner under non-stress condition. Furthermore, Ro 16-6028 reverses the stress-induced augmentation of the synthesis in prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that Ro 16-6028 has an anxiolytic profile and that central dopamine system plays an important role in stress reaction.",

    "30": "The application of the axial dispersion model to diazepam hepatic elimination was evaluated using data obtained for several conditions using the single-pass isolated perfused rat liver preparation. The influence of alterations in the fraction unbound in perfusate (fu) and perfusate flow (Q) on the availability (F) of diazepam was studied under steady conditions (n = 4 in each case). Changes in fu were produced by altering the concentration of human serum albumin (HSA) in the perfusion medium while maintaining diazepam concentration at 1 mg L-1. In the absence of protein (fu = 1), diazepam availability was 0.011 +/- 0.005 (mean +/- SD). As fu decreased, availability progressively increased and at a HSA concentration of 2% (g/100 ml), when fu was 0.023, diazepam availability was 0.851 +/- 0.011. Application of the axial dispersion model to the relationship between fu and F provided estimates for the dispersion number (DN) of 0.337 +/- 0.197, and intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) of 132 +/- 34 ml min-1. The availability of diazepam during perfusion with protein-free media was also studied at three different flow rates (15, 22.5, and 30 ml min-1). Diazepam availability always progressively increased as perfusate flow increased, with the axial dispersion model yielding estimates for DN of 0.393 +/- 0.128 and CL(int) of 144 +/- 38 ml min-1. The transient form of the two-compartment dispersion model was also applied to the output concentration versus time profile of diazepam after bolus input of a radiolabeled tracer into the hepatic portal vein (n = 4), providing DN and CL(int) estimates of 0.251 +/- 0.093 and 135 +/- 59 ml min-1, respectively. Hence, all methods provided similar estimates for DN and CL(int). Furthermore, the magnitude of DN is similar to that determined for noneliminated substances such as erythrocytes, albumin, sucrose, and water. These findings suggest that the dispersion of diazepam in the perfused rat liver is determined primarily by the architecture of the hepatic microvasculature.",

When used in these circumstances, the normal side effects of the narcosis (arrhythmia, rebound hypertensive convulsions, states of paradoxical anxiety) were almost completely absent. Furthermore, given the optimal quality of the rapid awakening, in about 5 minutes, the antagonistic qualities of the drug were confirmed making further development of the therapeutic uses of the benzodiazepines possible.",

The benzodiazepines under investigation proved to be stable, with the exception of ketazolam for which complete degradation to diazepam was observed.", 
    "34": "The acute anticonvulsant efficacy of diazepam (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was evaluated by repeated test injection in kindled rats subcutaneously implanted with diazepam-filled or empty silastic tubes for 3 weeks. Tolerance developed to acute test injections in both diazepam- and sham-implanted rats. Tolerance developed to a lesser extent in another group of diazepam-implanted rats which did not receive acute intermittent anticonvulsant tests. The hypothesis that contingent tolerance had developed to the anticonvulsant actions of benzodiazepines (diazepam, 1.5 mg/kg, i.p. and clobazam, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) in kindled rats given acute intermittent injections was investigated using a 'before-after' design. Significant contingent tolerance developed in rats which received intermittent benzodiazepine treatment before, but not after, amygdala stimulation. Tolerance developed to different extents depending on the seizure measure evaluated (forelimb clonus duration, amygdala afterdischarge duration, motor seizure latency and duration, and seizure stage). Contingent tolerance to both benzodiazepines developed at a similar rate. The findings suggest that contingent tolerance may contribute a sizeable component to the overall functional benzodiazepine tolerance measured in long-term anticonvulsant drug studies in kindled rats. Several questions regarding contingent tolerance phenomena are posed and the implications of these findings for studies using repeated anticonvulsant testing are discussed.", 
    "35": "In an open, prospective clinical trial, midazolam anaesthesia was compared with thiopental (plus suxamethonium chloride as a muscle relaxant) to clinically evaluate the former as an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Twelve depressed patients underwent a course of ECT, receiving midazolam or thiopental anaesthesia alternatively. Significant differences were found in seizure duration between the two anaesthetics. Midazolam shortened the seizures to a duration that was not therapeutically desirable. There were no differences in stimulus parameters between the two groups. The muscle relaxant effect of midazolam failed to provide optimal paralysis. Thus, midazolam anaesthesia offers no advantage over standard anaesthetic agents for ECT.", 
    "36": "Different studies have shown an elevation of GH levels in insulin-dependent diabetic adults and its modification after pirenzepine administration. We have studied nocturnal GH secretion (NIGHS) and fructosamine levels before and after one month of administering a nocturnal dose of pirenzepine [Gastrozepin (R.) 0.6 mg/kg] in a group of eight young insulin-dependent diabetics, 6 males and 2 females. The ages of the subjects ranged between 12 and 17 years with a mean age of 15.28 years. The most important findings were: 1) The NIGHS was not modified by pirenzepine administration, 10.88 +/- 3.81 ng/ml/min vs 11.25 +/- 7.90 ng/ml/min, p greater than 0.05. However, two patients showed a clear decrease in their G.H. levels. 2) Plasma fructosamine levels were also unaffected, 409 +/- 101 mmol/l vs 361 +/- 127 mmol/l, p greater than 0.05. However, the levels of five individual patients decreased after pirenzepine administration. We conclude that oral pirenzepine administration at this dose does not modify GH secretion nor improve short term metabolic control of the disease in young insulin-dependent diabetics. Further investigation, using higher doses and for a more prolonged period of time, is necessary to know the long term effects of this treatment.", 
    "37": "Cerebral blood velocity (CBV) was measured with transcranial Doppler in 6 normal right-handed male volunteers before and for 50 min after an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg/kg of diazepam and normal saline during 2 separate visits to the laboratory. Blood pressure, pulse rate, end tidal levels of carbon dioxide and mood changes were quantified before and after the injections. Diazepam injection was associated with significant increases in fatigue and sleepiness. There were no significant changes in end tidal carbon dioxide, respiration, pulse rate, and blood pressure after the injection. Postdiazepam CBV was significantly lower following diazepam compared to CBV following placebo.", 
    "38": "We examined the electrical resistance of the paw pads of mice under the same conditions as used previously in studies of the passive avoidance response. Administration of scopolamine (0.05-1 mg/kg, SC) 10 or 30 min prior to placement of animals in an experimental box resulted in a profound increase in electrical resistance. In contrast, subcutaneous injection of butylscopolamine (1-20 mg/kg), diazepam (1 or 2 mg/kg), or pentobarbital (10 or 20 mg/kg) did not substantially alter subject resistance. Scopolamine may act on the CNS to induce increased paw skin resistance.", 
    "39": "Two rat lines bred for differences in motor impairment in the tilting plane test after a moderate dose of ethanol were compared for peripheral hormone responses. The alcohol-sensitive ANT rats had significantly lower plasma corticosterone concentrations than the alcohol-insensitive AT rats 30 min after an IP saline injection. Ethanol (2 g/kg, IP) and lorazepam (3 mg/kg, IP) injections increased the corticosterone concentration in ANT rats. Sodium barbital (160 mg/kg, IP) did not produce any increase in these rats; instead, it prevented any increase caused by a tilting plane test procedure 10 min before decapitation. Three trials on the tilting plane significantly elevated the corticosterone concentration in saline-treated ANT rats, but produced no additional increase in drug-treated ANT rats. In AT rats, drug injections caused no significant corticosterone increase but the tilting plane test procedure after barbital (lorazepam) treatment(s) elevated the corticosterone concentration. Cold exposure (+4 degrees C for 30 min) of the drug-naive animals elevated their concentrations of serum and adrenal corticosterone, thyrotropin, and growth hormone, but not of prolactin and luteinizing hormone. The increase in serum corticosterone was greater in AT than ANT rats, whereas the increase in serum thyrotropin was slightly greater in ANT rats. No differences between the rat lines were found in the growth hormone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone levels. The results confirm and extend our earlier findings of the inability of ANT rats to produce additional stress responses to behavioral challenges when being intoxicated by sedative drugs, which may at least partly account for their increased sensitivity to sedative drugs.", 
    "40": "Administration of diazepam (0.28 mg/kg, IP; 60 min) to male mice or to female mice at oestrus or dioestrus increased the number of transitions made between the light and dark chambers of a test apparatus, a presumed anxiolytic action. However, the same dose of diazepam had no effect on light/dark transitions at late dioestrus, proestrus, or metoestrus II. At metoestrus I, this test dose of diazepam induced a decrease in the number of light/dark transitions and significant changes in other test parameters indicative of an increase in fearfulness or light aversion. Concentrations of diazepam in the brain after intraperitoneal injection were not influenced by the stage of the oestrous cycle, suggesting that the observed changes in responses to diazepam reflect changes in sensitivity to this drug rather than alterations in distribution or metabolism. The results indicate a physiological influence of ovarian steroid hormones on sensitivity to the benzodiazepine tranquilisers.", 
    "41": "The effect of diazepam withdrawal (2 mg/kg/day) on release of [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) and [14C]-GABA from rat cortical and hippocampal slices was studied. No changes in [14C]-GABA release (basal, K(+)-evoked, uptake) from slices of either region were observed. Similarly, all parameters of [3H]-5-HT release were unchanged in cortical slices. However, during diazepam withdrawal, depolarised [3H]-5-HT release from hippocampal slices was raised with no changes in basal release or uptake into the slices being found. This increase could be prevented by in vivo administration of 1 mg/kg baclofen--this dose having no significant effect on [3H]-5-HT release from hippocampal slices of control rats. To further investigate this effect, 45Ca2+ uptake into hippocampal synaptosomes was examined and found to be increased during withdrawal. This was blocked by in vitro addition of 10 microM (-)baclofen, which had no effect on 45Ca2+ uptake in controls. Inhibition of 45Ca2+ uptake by (-)baclofen was also enhanced in nonwithdrawn diazepam-treated rats, but not in rats treated acutely with diazepam. The results from both studies indicate that chronic diazepam treatment increases neuronal sensitivity to baclofen. These results are discussed with reference to the anxiogenic state during diazepam withdrawal and a recent report of reversal of this behaviour by baclofen.", 
    "42": "Anxiety is almost inevitably present in patients facing surgery. The optimal management of postoperative pain requires the acknowledgement of perioperative anxiety and the inclusion of pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological means of alleviating the fear and worry inherent in the surgical experience. In a double-blind randomized design, 39 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomies were given postoperative access to a standard patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine pump for pain and a PCA pump dispensing either low-dose midazolam or saline for anxiety. Measures of anxiety and pain were completed pre-operatively and for 2 days postoperatively. Utilization of morphine and 'anxiolytic agent' were recorded. Analysis of covariance was applied to the data to control for the imbalance of cancer patients between the 2 groups. While both groups of patients chose to utilize their 'anxiety pump' throughout the study, those patients receiving midazolam had significantly lower postoperative Spielberger State Anxiety scores and visual analogue scale anxiety scores. Patient-controlled midazolam in doses used in this study were safe and effective in managing anxiety but did not influence pain scores or the amount of PCA morphine patients used. Pre-operative levels of depression were significantly associated with postoperative pain levels independent of treatment group or cancer diagnosis.", 
    "43": "This study investigated antinociceptive effects of intrathecal morphine combined with intrathecal clonidine, noradrenaline, carbachol or midazolam in rats. Each animal received intrathecally, on 3 separate occasions (i) 2 micrograms morphine (M), (ii) a dose (D) of one of the non-opioid drugs, and (iii) a combination, 1/2(M+D), consisting of 1 microgram morphine plus half the dose of the non-opioid drug. Antinociceptive effects were assessed by the hot-plate and tail-flick tests over the duration of drug action. All non-opioid drugs studied led to dose-related antinociceptive effects when given alone. Addition of morphine caused a left shift in the dose-response curves of all the non-opioid drugs, indicating at least some degree of additive effects. Effects were considered supra-additive when the effect of the combination, 1/2(M+D), was significantly greater than both the effect of 2 micrograms morphine and the dose of non-opioid. Evidence of supra-additive antinociceptive effects was obtained only with the clonidine-morphine combination.", 
    "44": "Mental and psychomotor abilities are impaired to varying degrees after general anaesthesia. This has important implications for the time over which patients are monitored in the recovery room and for the discharge of outpatients after day surgery. The present study was undertaken to compare recovery and mental and psychomotor skills in the first 60 min following general anaesthesia with isoflurane, midazolam/alfentanil and propofol. METHODS. A total of 45 patients undergoing microsurgical lumbar nucleotomy were randomized to three study groups. Group 1 (n = 15): anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with isoflurane; group 2 (n = 15): anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and maintained with alfentanil; group 3 (n = 15): anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol. Vecuronium was used for muscle relaxation and the lungs were ventilated with a mixture of 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. The following were checked 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after extubation: choice reaction times and critical flicker fusion for psychomotor testing; the maze test and a modification of the ball-bearing test for discrimination of motor and mental activities; and short- and long-term memory. RESULTS. Immediate recovery did not differ in the three different groups. In all patients psychomotor function was impaired compared with baseline for more than 60 min after general anaesthesia. However, impairment was significantly less pronounced after propofol, and recovery to preanaesthesia values was faster following propofol than after midazolam/alfentanil, and slowest after isoflurane-anaesthesia (Figs. 1, 2). The flicker fusion frequency, a very sensitive parameter for the persisting effects of anaesthetics, was significantly higher following propofol anaesthesia and remained so throughout the entire study period (Fig. 3). By 30 min after extubation, short-term memory was already normal in patients who had undergone propofol anaesthesia, and a statistically significant difference from the midazolam/alfentanil and isoflurane anaesthesia groups was obvious throughout the entire study period. However, no differences in long-term memory were found. At 30 min after propofol anaesthesia all patients were able to perform the ball-bearing test, as against 13 patients following midazolam/alfentanil and 10 patients following isoflurane (Table 3). The maze test was mostly impaired after midazolam/alfentanil anaesthesia. Patients who underwent isoflurane anaesthesia needed the same time for the maze test at 60 min afterwards propofol patients needed after 30 min (Table 2). Side effects, e.g., nausea, vomiting, and double vision, were observed significantly more often in groups 1 and 2 (Table 4). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION. The results indicate that in operations of approximately 90 min duration the return of motor and mental abilities is faster following propofol anaesthesia. At 30 min after extubation following propofol anaesthesia patients had test results that allow their transfer from the recovery room, while it took 60 min for patients in the two other groups to reach the same levels of motor and mental function. This is important for the duration of monitoring in the recovery room and, especially, for day case anaesthesia.", 
    "45": "Oral presurgical medication with benzodiazepines carries several distinct advantages; it often reduces the patient's anxiety and allows for a \"smoother\" surgical procedure, provides analgesia, facilitates venipuncture, aids in the patient's tolerance of an ankle tourniquet, limits postoperative nausea and vomiting, and provides varying degrees of retrograde amnesia. Many podiatric surgeons prefer using oral anxiolytics/sedatives along with local anesthesia for their surgical patients because they are simple to use with in-office surgery. Patients may prefer this method because it allows them a sense of control and eliminates the fear of being \"put to sleep.\" This method, however, is not without its potential drawbacks, as noted. The surgeon must be keenly aware of all the patient's medical problems and potential allergies, and how they may impact on the use of these agents. He or she also must be prepared to act in an emergency should an adverse reaction occur. The recovery time from local anesthesia with oral sedation can often be longer than from general anesthesia, and discharge may be delayed. The patient may have an unsteady gait for the period prior to complete drug elimination and may require assistance. If an oral agent is chosen, it must be administered early enough to provide the desired effect at the desired time. The clinician must be aware of the time to onset and the duration of action of the drug chosen. Dosage adjustments must be considered in the elderly, individuals with medical disorders, and patients taking multiple medications. If IV premedication is selected, the clinician must be even more aware of its potential effects and well trained in emergency procedures. IV administration allows the patient to present to the surgical suite without being sedated. The medication should be given shortly after venipuncture; the patient then becomes relaxed and ready for the local anesthesia. Intravenous sedation can be maintained throughout the procedure by carefully titrating small incremental doses; however, this requires close observation and monitoring of vital signs. This route often results in a faster drug elimination, patient recovery, and discharge. It has been said that the best preoperative anxiolytic is a complete, thorough, and reassuring preoperative explanation of the events that are to follow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Flumazenil, in doses to 1.0 mg intravenously, has been shown in clinical trials to be effective for the complete reversal of benzodiazepine sedation after intravenous conscious sedation or general anesthesia. It is effective even in the presence of other drugs, including opioids. Most patients are aroused and completely alert within a few minutes after the administration of flumazenil and maintained their alertness throughout the 180-min observation period.",

This correlation dimension characterizes the dynamics of the sleep EEG and it estimates the degrees of freedom of the signal under study. We demonstrate that slow-wave sleep depicts a much smaller dimensionality than light or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and that Lorazepam does not alter the EEG's dimensionality except in stage II and REM.", 
    "52": "Sixty patients who underwent simple total hysterectomy under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia with midazolam sedation, were the subjects of a randomized double-blind comparison of intramuscular midazolam 4, 4.5 and 5 mg, and a dose determined by body weight as premedicants. Similar changes in arterial pressure and heart rate were observed. Furthermore sedation and the value of pulse oximetry on arrival were the same. Besides half the patients were amnesic during the procedure of regional approach. However the dose of premedicant was inversely correlated with the maintenance dose. The reduction of pulse oximetry reading on the induction was smaller, while the requirement of vasopressor occurred earlier following the larger dose of premedicant. In spite of the slower induction, the fall of pulse oximetry reading did not decrease. One hour after incision, the reduction of PaO2 was not dose related. In addition count of leucocyte and the level of blood glucose were unchanged. Premedicant determined by body weight was not correlated with the induction dose and amnesic effect. Our findings suggest midazolam 5 mg intramuscularly is the more preferable dose, but careful attention on arterial pressure is required.",

Assessments were made of outcome derived from clinical symptomatology, formal psychiatric diagnosis, psychotropic drug use and frequency of contact with both primary care and psychiatric services. Using discriminant function analysis it was found that better outcome was associated with younger patients, fewer symptoms at time of withdrawal and, more particularly, six months later, less personality disturbance, and longer duration of diazepam use before withdrawal.

Similarly high mortality rate (37%) was observed in diazepam sensitive mice derived from a Swiss albino stock. In contrast, zero mortality was observed in Swiss albino mice administered with DMSO or diazepam (35 mg/kg). Mortality at 60 mg/kg diazepam was only 10%. The high mortality caused by oxazepam in Swiss albino mice seemed to be strain-related as only 7% mortality was observed with identically treated BALB/c mice. Since DMSO is the only convenient vehicle for the administration of oxazepam by injection, it is suggested that a suitable strain must be selected for experimentation in order to avoid unnecessary loss of animals.",

    "62": "The interaction of ORG 9426, a new non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, with intravenous anaesthetic drugs (fentanyl, thiopental, midazolam, droperidol and etomidate) has been investigated in cats. During an infusion of one of the above anaesthetics, the ED95 dose was determined by titration, and thereafter muscle relaxation was maintained with four subsequent doses of ORG 9426. Neither the potency nor the duration of action of the first dose nor that of the maintenance doses of ORG 9426 differed from those observed in a control group of cats anaesthetized with intraperitoneally administered pentobarbital.

The propofol group showed significantly lower peroperative blood pressure compared to the thiopentone/midazolam group. The second propofol group required significantly less alfentanil to stabilize the blood pressure, compared to the methohexitone group. Completeness of recovery, assessed by means of a coin counting test, was faster in the propofol group compared to the thiopentone/midazolam group, while no difference could be demonstrated between the second propofol group and the methohexitone group. It is concluded that propofol seems to be superior to both thiopentone/midazolam and methohexitone with respect to the stability of peroperative blood pressure.

No significant relationship was found between type and severity of epilepsy and occurrence of malformations or isolated microcephaly. Valproate and phenytoin were the most teratogenic (all malformations). None of the malformations observed in IME whose mothers received valproate, phenytoin, or phenobarbital was seen in IME not exposed to the respective AEDs.

    "66": "A recently reported multinational, 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of alprazolam versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder indicated significant differences favoring alprazolam. We now report the results of a three-site, 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing alprazolam 2 mg, alprazolam 6 mg, and placebo in 94 patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Both alprazolam treatment groups (6 mg and 2 mg) improved significantly more than did the placebo treatment group on most outcome measures. Only a few statistically significant differences between the 6 mg and 2 mg alprazolam groups were discerned, although the pattern of treatment response across measures suggested a dose effect. Dropouts in the placebo group were primarily due to lack of efficacy and in the alprazolam 6 mg group were due to side effects, which may have contributed to the limited differences between groups at study end. The findings suggest that many patients may require less than 6 mg of alprazolam per day for effective treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "67": "Two groups of 12 outpatients each (six men and six women) with generalized anxiety disorder, participated in this study. Each patient was treated single-blind with placebo during the first 7 days (baseline), followed by a double-blind drug treatment period of 4 consecutive weeks (active) and ending again with 7 days single-blind placebo treatment (washout). One group received buspirone 5 mg three times a day in the first week and continued with 10 mg in the morning, 5 mg in the afternoon, and 5 mg in the evening during the second, third, and fourth weeks. The other group received diazepam 5 mg three times a day in all 4 weeks. On the evening of the seventh day of each treatment week the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the Symptom Check List (90 items) were applied to assess the therapeutic effects, followed by an on-the-road driving test that started 1.5 hours after the last drug or placebo intake. The test consisted of operating an instrumented vehicle over a 100 kilometer highway circuit while attempting to maintain a constant speed and a steady lateral position within the right traffic lane. Two patients in the diazepam group were unable to complete their test after the first and second treatment week, respectively, because of serious sedative reactions. Both buspirone and diazepam were equally effective in reducing overall anxiety symptoms. The specific profiles showed that buspirone also reduced concomitant depressive symptoms and symptoms of interpersonal sensitivity and anger-hostility. In contrast, diazepam was found to be slightly more effective in reducing somatic symptoms and to positively affect sleep disturbances. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of diazepam resulted in a relapse of psychic anxiety symptoms comparable with the placebo-baseline level and a partial relapse of somatic anxiety symptoms. Chronic treatment with buspirone had no significant effects on lateral position and speed control. In contrast, diazepam significantly impaired control of lateral position in the first 3 weeks of treatment. There was no significant impairment in the fourth treatment week and the placebo-washout week. Speed control was significantly impaired only in the first week. The relevance of the trend toward decreasing performance impairment during chronic treatment remains to be established.", 
    "68": "The pharmacologic effects of lorazepam (2 mg), buspirone (20 mg, 10 mg), secobarbital (100 mg), and placebo were compared in 15 male, experienced, intermittent nontherapeutic drug users. All drugs produced a \"drug effect,\" however, buspirone 20 mg was significantly less liked than were lorazepam, secobarbital, or buspirone 10 mg (p less than .05) but not placebo. Lorazepam was liked better than were other drugs only at 1 hour and only compared with buspirone 20 and placebo. Compared with other drugs, lorazepam drug effects were greater and resulted in more prolonged impairment of a motor tracking task, standing steadiness, and memory. Buspirone 20 mg significantly impaired memory at 1 hour compared with placebo. Subjects were more likely to identify buspirone as unfamiliar. Because buspirone 20 mg was less liked than were other drugs, dose escalation as part of drug abuse is not likely to occur. Lorazepam also was not particularly liked and was not different from placebo on most subjective abuse-relevant measures.",

There were two trial periods of 12 days each with a wash-out period of 9 days between them (total duration: 12 + 12 + 9 = 33 days). During the 12-day periods they received either felodipine or placebo each morning under fasting conditions. On day 6 of each of the two 12-day periods, diazepam, 10 mg was injected i.v. 30 minutes after the felodipine/placebo. Diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations were measured in plasma up to 168 hours after the injection. Diazepam plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters were not affected by the concomitant medication with felodipine. However, the co-administration of felodipine increased desmethyldiazepam plasma concentrations relative to placebo: mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 4,910 vs 5,581 ng.h/ml and mean peak concentrations of 40 vs 47 ng/ml. Felodipine might cause a retarded elimination of desmethyldiazepam, possibly by obtruding the formation of oxazepam. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be elucidated.",

    "71": "Several lines of evidence have suggested that muscarinic receptors may possess more than one ligand binding site. In this study, the interactions of cocaine with primary and secondary (allosteric) sites on muscarinic receptors in membrane homogenates from post-mortem human brainstem were examined. (-)-Cocaine inhibited the binding of the tritiated muscarinic antagonists N-methylscopolamine (NMS) and pirenzepine to an apparent single class of sites, with Ki values of 200-300 microM. The binding of the muscarinic agonist [3H]oxotremorine-M was inhibited with a similar Ki value (200 microM). (+)-Cocaine, although not the naturally occurring stereoisomer, was 10-20-fold more potent than (-)-cocaine in competing for binding to the primary muscarinic recognition site. The binding of cocaine was unaffected by guanine nucleotides or N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with its purported action as a competitive antagonist. Cocaine was not selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes. Rosenthal analysis of the [3H]NMS saturation binding data in the presence of increasing concentrations of either (-)-cocaine or (+)-cocaine indicated that both isomers produced an apparent competitive-like reduction in the [3H]NMS affinity. Schild regression analysis of the saturation binding data resulted in curvilinear plots suggestive of cooperative or allosteric interactions of (-)-cocaine with the [3H]NMS-labeled receptors. The effects of (-)-cocaine on the kinetics of [3H]NMS binding were consistent with an allosteric interaction with the receptor. Increasing concentrations of cocaine markedly slowed the rate of [3H]NMS dissociation from the primary recognition site. The allosteric modulation of [3H] NMS binding by (-)-cocaine was abolished with increasing ionic strength. Taken together, these data demonstrate that (-)-cocaine interacts with primary and allosteric recognition sites on muscarinic receptors.", 
    "72": "Use of benzodiazepines in a Swedish community with a general population of about 20,000 was studied using data from a research registry on prescriptions. A cohort of all benzodiazepine users in 1976, aged 15-84 years, was identified and followed for 8 years with respect to continued benzodiazepine use. A strong tendency towards continuous use was observed. Nearly 70% of the cohort continued use of benzodiazepines during the first follow-up year, 56% used benzodiazepines during the second year as well. One third continued using benzodiazepines during all 8 years of follow-up. Heavy use, previous use of benzodiazepines and age were of great importance for predicting long-term use while sex and type of benzodiazepine were of minor importance. However, after 3 or 4 years of use the pattern was very much the same in all subgroups, about 90% of users continued irrespective of user characteristics.",

Blood samples were collected before and 24 h after the start of the sedation and 0, 24, 72, 120, and 172 h after the last dose. ALT and AST activities did not change appreciably, but the glutathione transferase B1 concentration decreased significantly (P less than 0.03) at all times studied. The patients who received isoflurane and those who received midazolam showed no significant differences in any of the enzyme tests. We conclude that long-term sedation with midazolam or isoflurane is unlikely to affect hepatocellular integrity.", 
    "74": "We endeavored to determine whether three behavioral effects of melatonin in rodents, i.e., depression of locomotor activity in hamsters, analgesia in mice, and impairment of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MP) convulsions, exhibited the time dependency known to occur for several neuroendocrine effects of the hormone. Activity was monitored and registered by means of an optical actometer, and analgesia was assessed by the hot-plate procedure. Locomotor activity, analgesia, and seizure susceptibility were maximal at the beginning of the scotophase and minimal at noon. The effects of melatonin on the three parameters peaked at early night. The administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, although unable by itself to modify locomotor activity, pain, or seizure threshold, blunted the activity of melatonin. These results suggest that the time-dependent effects of melatonin on specific rodent behaviors may be mediated by central synapses employing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as an inhibitory transmitter.", 
    "75": "To investigate the relative participation of peripheral (CCK-A) and central (CCK-B) cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in satiety induced by endogenous CCK, we examined the effect of the CCK-A antagonist MK-329 (10-315 micrograms/kg) and the CCK-B antagonist L 365260 (0.1-315 micrograms/kg) on intake of a 20% sucrose solution in mildly food-deprived mice. Intraperitoneal injection of MK-329 elicited a dose-related increase in sucrose consumption with a minimal effective dose of 31.5 micrograms/kg. This dose increased sucrose intake 23% and the highest dose tested, 315 micrograms/kg, increased sucrose intake 63% above baseline. In contrast to MK-329, intraperitoneal administration of L 365260 had no effect on sucrose intake at doses up to 315 micrograms/kg. To examine the contribution of these two CCK receptor subtypes in satiety induced by exogenous CCK, CCK-8 (8 micrograms/kg) was administered alone and in combination with MK-329 and L 365260. MK-329 (10 micrograms/kg) significantly attenuated the satiety effect of CCK-8, and L 365260 (100 micrograms/kg) was without effect. These results suggest that the peripheral CCK receptor subtype mediates satiety induced by endogenous and exogenous CCK in the mouse.", 
    "76": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam, on one hand, and the partial agonist bretazenil and inverse agonist Ro 19-4603, on the other, were characterized in vivo in rats using effect parameters derived from quantitative EEG analysis. Male Wistar-derived rats received an i.v. infusion of 3 mg/kg bretazenil or 3 mg/kg Ro 19-4603 in 5 min during a steady-state infusion of midazolam at a rate of 2.8 mg/kg/hr. EEG signals were continuously measured and quantified by aperiodic EEG analysis and the change in amplitudes in the 11.5 to 30 Hz (beta) frequency band was used as measure of drug effect on the central nervous system. Frequent arterial blood samples were taken to determine the pharmacokinetics of the drugs. Both bretazenil and Ro 19-4603 did not influence the steady-state plasma concentrations of midazolam, but markedly antagonized the midazolam-induced increase in EEG effect measure to the extent of their own intrinsic maximal effects. The changes in EEG effect as a function of drug concentrations were described by a competitive interaction model, allowing the estimation of the pharmacodynamic parameters (means +/- S.E.) of the partial agonist, Emax = 15 +/- 5 microV/sec and EC50 = 19 +/- 5 ng/ml, and inverse agonist, Emax = -5.8 +/- 1.6 microV/sec and EC50 = 7.8 +/- 2.5 ng/ml. Similar values of the pharmacodynamic parameters were obtained after a single i.v. administration of these drugs, which provides evidence for the validity of the proposed interaction model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Squirrel monkeys were trained to press a key under a multiple schedule of food presentation. In the presence of either green or red stimulus lights, the 30th response produced a food pellet (fixed-ratio schedule). In the presence of the red stimulus lights (punishment component), the first response of each fixed-ratio produced either an i.v. injection of histamine [30.0-100.0 micrograms/kg/injection (inj)] or saline, accompanied by a 200-msec presentation of amber stimulus lights. Sessions in which histamine was injected alternated with sessions in which saline was injected. Another group of subjects was studied under identical schedule conditions except that electric shock was scheduled with the 200-msec stimulus light. During alternate sessions, electric shock at a high or low intensity with the stimulus, or the stimulus alone was scheduled. When performances stabilized, histamine or high intensity electric shock selectively suppressed responding in the punishment component; saline, low intensity electric shock or the stimulus light alone had no effects. Subsequently, different doses of histamine, I-nicotine, cocaine or beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) were substituted for histamine during single sessions. Histamine (17.8-100 micrograms/kg/inj), I-nicotine (32 micrograms/kg/inj) and beta-CCE (10-56 micrograms/kg/inj), but not cocaine (10.0-100.0 micrograms/kg/inj), produced a dose-related selective suppression of responding similar to that obtained with electric shock, suggesting that the drugs were functioning as punishers. Punishment by beta-CCE was antagonized with the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "86": "Premedication for painful procedures in children with cancer is not routinely used. Many medications used are only intermittently effective or require special equipment or anesthesia support. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, the safety and efficacy of midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, were compared with the safety and efficacy of fentanyl, a short-acting narcotic analgesic. In 25 children studied, 100% of children and their parents preferred study drugs to any previous premedication. Seventy-two percent preferred midazolam to fentanyl. Preprocedural anxiety, adverse behavioral symptoms, and visual analog scales all improved and side effects were minimal. It is concluded that premedication for painful procedures should be used routinely in children with cancer. With proper monitoring, fentanyl and midazolam can be used safely in the outpatient clinic setting. Midazolam was found to be the drug of preference for the majority of patients.",

    "88": "The authors examined direct myocardial and coronary vascular responses to the anesthetic induction agents etomidate, ketamine, midazolam, propofol, and thiopental and compared their effects on attenuating autoregulation of coronary flow as assessed by changes in oxygen supply/demand relationships. Spontaneous heart rate, atrioventricular conduction time during atrial pacing, left ventricular pressure (LVP), coronary flow (CF), percent oxygen extraction, oxygen delivery, and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo2) were examined in 55 isolated guinea pig hearts divided into five groups of 11 each. Hearts were perfused at constant pressure with one of the drugs administered at steady-state concentrations increasing from 0.5 microM to 1 mM. Adenosine was given to test maximal CF. At concentrations below 10 microM no significant changes were observed; beyond 50 microM for midazolam, etomidate, and propofol, and 100 microM for thiopental and ketamine, each agent caused progressive but differential decreases in heart rate, atrioventricular conduction time (leading to atrioventricular dissociation), LVP, +dLVP/dtmax, percent oxygen extraction, and MVo2. The concentrations (microM) at which +dLVP/dtmax was reduced by 50% were as follows: etomidate, 82 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM); propofol, 91 +/- 4; midazolam, 105 +/- 8; thiopental, 156 +/- 11; and ketamine, 323 +/- 7; the rank order of potency was etomidate = propofol = midazolam greater than thiopental greater than ketamine; results were similar for LVP. At the 100 microM concentration, CF was decreased 11% +/- 2% by ketamine and 5% +/- 3% by thiopental but was increased 17% +/- 6% by etomidate, 21% +/- 5% by midazolam, and near maximally to 57% +/- 10% by propofol; MVo2 was decreased 8% +/- 4% by thiopental, 10% +/- 5% by ketamine, 19% +/- 5% by midazolam, 29% +/- 7% by etomidate, and 37% +/- 5% by propofol; oxygen delivery/MVo2 was unchanged by thiopental and ketamine but was increased 62% +/- 7% by midazolam, 71% +/- 9% by etomidate, and 150% +/- 15% by propofol. Between 100 microM and 1 mM, thiopental and ketamine did not increase CF but decreased MVo2 and percent oxygen extraction, whereas propofol maximally increased CF and decreased MVo2 and midazolam and etomidate had intermediate effects. These results indicate that on a molar basis, propofol, and less so midazolam and etomidate, depress cardiac function moderately more than thiopental and ketamine, and that propofol markedly attenuates autoregulation by causing coronary vasodilation. With doses used to induce anesthesia, propofol and thiopental appear to depress cardiac function more than ketamine or etomidate.", 
    "89": "Reconstructive infrarenal aortic surgery is associated with impairment of renal function owing to vasoconstriction during and after aortic cross-clamping. To assess the influence of anesthetic technique on renal hemodynamics during aortic surgery, 34 patients received one of four anesthetics: isoflurane (n = 10), halothane (n = 9), droperidol (n = 8), and flunitrazepam (n = 7). Supplemental anesthesia consisted of midazolam, fentanyl, nitrous oxide in oxygen (50%), and pancuronium. Before aortic cross-clamping, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) (131iodohippuran clearance) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (99technetium-DTPA clearance) were low in the halothane and flunitrazepam groups (118.4 +/- 25.6 and 170 +/- 35 mL/min for ERPF; 19.7 +/- 5.2 and 26.9 +/- 5.8 mL/min for GFR, respectively) and better preserved in the isoflurane group (253.4 +/- 51.5 and 44.9 +/- 8.4 mL/min, respectively; P less than 0.05 between isoflurane and halothane groups) or in the droperidol group as regards GFR (75.4 +/- 9.4 mL/min, P less than 0.05). During clamping, both renal variables were not markedly affected in any group except in the droperidol group in whom GFR significantly decreased from preclamp value. The GFR was then significantly higher in the isoflurane group (49.5 +/- 9.2 mL/min) than in the halothane and flunitrazepam groups (14.8 +/- 3.7 and 26.5 +/- 10.1 mL/min, respectively; P less than 0.05). After aortic declamping, ERPF and GFR increased markedly in the halothane group, and there was no significant difference between the groups. These results suggest that renal hemodynamics are less altered with droperidol-fentanyl anesthesia during abdominal surgery but not during aortic cross-clamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "Recent studies suggest that psychotropic drugs may help the symptoms associated with spastic esophageal motor disorders. However, the physiologic effects of central nervous system depression (a side effect of such therapy) on esophageal function is not known. Therefore, we studied the effect of alprazolam (Xanax), a popular new benzodiazepine anxiolytic, in 10 healthy volunteers, using a randomized, placebo-controlled design. Stationary esophageal motility, 24-h pH monitoring, and 24-h ambulatory motility monitoring was done while on placebo or one tablet (0.25 mg) of alprazolam taken three times a day. Alprazolam had no significant effect on lower esophageal sphincter pressure or motility in the esophagus. Upper esophageal sphincter pressure, however, was significantly decreased. What is more important, one-third of the healthy volunteers had abnormal amounts of nocturnal acid reflux during the alprazolam phase of the study. This effect was probably due to alprazolam-induced central nervous system depression interfering with normal nocturnal acid clearance mechanisms triggered by arousal from sleep.", 
    "91": "Since it has been suggested that the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) may contribute to bowel distention, we evaluated the effects of N2O on operating conditions during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 50 healthy patients using a double-blind protocol design. All patients received the same preanesthetic medication (midazolam, 2 mg intravenously) and induction of anesthesia consisted of intravenously administered fentanyl 1.5 micrograms.kg-1, thiopental 4-6 mg.kg-1, and a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. For maintenance of anesthesia, patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: group 1 (n = 26) received isoflurane with 70% N2O in oxygen (O2), whereas group 2 (n = 24) received isoflurane in an air/O2 mixture. The surgeon (blinded to the anesthetic technique) estimated the degree of technical difficulty before beginning the operation using a five-point scale. At 15-min intervals throughout the operation, the surgeon was asked to evaluate both \"overall operating conditions\" and degree of \"bowel distension\" using independent five-point scales. At the end of the operation, the surgeon was asked whether or not N2O had been used as part of the anesthetic technique. There were no significant intraoperative differences between the two groups with respect to operating conditions or bowel distension. More importantly, there was no time-related change in either variable during the course of the operation. Finally, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was similar in both treatment groups. The surgeon was able to correctly determine that N2O had been administered only 44% of the time. Thus, N2O had no clinically apparent deleterious effects during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.", 
    "92": "The effects of propofol, etomidate, midazolam, and fentanyl on motor evoked responses to transcranial stimulation (tc-MERs) were studied in five healthy human volunteers.

Electrical tc-MERs (tce-MERs) were elicited with anodal stimuli of 500-700 V. Magnetic tc-MERs (tcmag-MERs) were elicited using a Cadwell MES-10 magnetic stimulator at maximum output. Compound muscle action potentials were recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle. Duplicate tce-MERs and tcmag-MERs were recorded before and up to 30 min after drug injection. Reproducible baseline tce-MERs (amplitude 4.7 +/- 0.43 (SEM) mV, latency 29.4 +/- 0.35 ms) and tcmag-MERs (amplitude 3.7 +/- 0.43 mV, latency 31.1 +/- 0.39 ms) were obtained in all subjects. Pronounced depression of tce-MER amplitude to 2% of baseline values (P less than 0.01) was observed 2 min after injection of propofol. Thirty minutes after injection of propofol, amplitude depression to 44% of baseline (P less than 0.05) was still present, despite an apparent lack of sedation. Midazolam caused significant (P less than 0.01) amplitude depression, e.g., tcmag-MER to 16% of baseline values 5 min after injection. Significant depression persisted throughout the 30-min study period. Fentanyl did not cause any statistically significant amplitude changes in this small population. Etomidate caused significant but transient depression of tc-MER amplitude. However, there was considerable intersubject variability. Latency did not change significantly after any drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "93": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is increasingly being used to assess left ventricular function (LVF). However, little data exist on the quantitative accuracy of this technique and its influence on LVF. Thus 50 ambulatory adult patients (mean age 62 +/- 15 years) were studied with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) immediately before, before the end, and 10 minutes after TEE. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using the modified Simpson's method. In subjects (n = 24) with impaired LVF (LVEF less than 55% by TTE), TTE-derived LVEF increased from 37 +/- 13% to 45 +/- 15% (p less than 0.001) during TEE. In 13 of 24 subjects with abnormal LVF, LVEF significantly increased during TEE as defined by an increase in LVEF by at least 5 ejection fraction units. In four of these subjects LVF normalized during TEE. LVEF was unchanged during and after TEE in the subjects (n = 26) with normal LVF (LVEF greater than 55%). An excellent correlation was found between LVEF derived by TEE and that derived by TTE performed during TEE (r = 0.93, SEE = 6.6%, p less than 0.001). LVEF determined by TEE compared well with that derived by TTE and should be a useful measure of global left ventricular function. However, an increase in LVEF during TEE occurs in over 50% of patients with impaired LVF and may be important to consider in individual subjects.", 
    "94": "Midazolam hydrochloride, a water-soluble benzodiazepine for intravenous injection, is frequently used to provide sedation to mechanically ventilated patients in the critical-care unit. Although the effects of midazolam on the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of healthy volunteers have been reported previously, to our knowledge such effects in ill patients have not been documented. Herein we describe the effects of intravenously administered midazolam on the EEGs of eight seriously ill patients (age range, 49 to 80 years; mean, 69 years). The EEGs showed drug-induced relatively fast (alpha or beta) frequency activity superimposed on delta slowing in six patients and mild to moderate voltage attenuation in three patients. An alpha frequency coma pattern, a transient burst-suppression pattern, and a spindle coma pattern were also seen. Thus, the effects of intravenously administered midazolam on the EEGs of seriously ill patients are similar to those noted after the administration of other benzodiazepines. These potential effects should be considered when their EEG tracings are interpreted.", 
    "95": "Quantitative assessment of neuromuscular block produced by large doses of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents during cardiac surgery is not possible with conventional methods of monitoring. Various \"posttetanic responses\" can, however, be elicited, even when no twitch response is present. Posttetanic responses measured by electromyography were used in this study. Twenty-four male patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were anesthetized with sufentanil plus diazepam. Neuromuscular block was provided either with pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg or with vecuronium 0.07 mg/kg initially and supplemented with small increments when indicated. Neuromuscular block was monitored from the hypothenar muscle. The ulnar nerve was stimulated by train-of-four, with superimposed periodic tetanic stimuli to evoke posttetanic responses, once every 7 to 15 minutes. The tetanically potentiated responses were detectable during 96% +/- 3.6 (vecuronium) and during 97% +/- 3.7 (pancuronium) of the entire intraoperative period, while the non-potentiated electromyographic responses were present for less than 50% of the time. The sum (of the amplitudes) of 6 posttetanic responses is significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than the sum of 6 nonpotentiated responses and than the size of a single-peak posttetanic response when compared with the normal, nonpotentiated responses. Higher-frequency tetanic stimuli (100 or 200 Hz) produced greater posttetanic responses (p less than 0.05) than did the 50-Hz tetanic stimulus. There were only slight or no significant differences in the degree of posttetanic potentiation between pancuronium and vecuronium either before, during, or after cardiopulmonary bypass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Plasma concentrations of S, epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and blood gases were determined. To obtain a further depth of anesthesia, 10 patients (SM group) received 4 micrograms/kg of S and 10 patients (SF group) received 4 micrograms/kg of S in combination with flunitrazepam, 40 micrograms/kg, in a randomized manner.

In 10 patients, intraoperative general anesthesia (GA) was based on a combination of intravenous (IV) sufentanil and midazolam. In 10 other patients, thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with 0.375% bupivacaine plus sufentanil, 1:200,000 (5 micrograms/mL), and intraoperative GA with midazolam/N2O were used. During the prebypass period, lower heart rates (HR), less variability in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was accompanied by less variability in plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in the TEA group. Although no differences were observed between the groups in perfusion pressure and the amount of vasoactive drugs used during the bypass period, variability in SVR was less in the TEA group. This was accompanied by less increase in NE and less variability in epinephrine (E) plasma concentrations. However, cortisol (Co) release was higher during this period in the TEA group. Weaning from bypass was accompanied by higher MAP and SVR in the TEA group at a lower HR, whereas no differences were observed in the E, NE, and Co plasma concentrations between the groups. During the first and second postoperative days, better pain relief and lower E and Co plasma concentrations were found in the TEA group. It can be concluded that better hemodynamic stability during the prebypass and bypass periods was accompanied by less E and NE release during these periods. Co release in the TEA group was higher during the bypass period. Weaning from bypass was characterized by better hemodynamics in the TEA group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Fifty-four patients were studied postoperatively after uncomplicated CABG. In the thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) group (n = 27), intraoperative analgesia was based on high TEA in combination with GA. In the GA group (n = 27), IV anesthesia with high-dose sufentanil and midazolam was used. Postoperative pain management in the GA group consisted of intermittent IV administration of nicomorphine, 0.1 mg/kg every 6 hours, whereas for the TEA group continuous high TEA with 0.125% bupivacaine plus sufentanil, 1:1,000,000 (0.05 mL/cm body length/hr) was used. Patients in the TEA group awakened earlier (148 [34] minutes vs 335 [51] minutes), resumed spontaneous respiration earlier (326 [79] minutes vs 982 [52] minutes), and were extubated earlier (463 [79] minutes vs 1140 [58] minutes). VAS score, SS, and postoperative PaO2 were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) better in the TEA group. The incidence of tachycardia (15 vs 2 patients) and postoperative myocardial ischemia (12 vs 4 patients) was higher in the GA group. It is concluded that intraoperative and postoperative pain treatment with epidurally administered bupivacaine plus sufentanil improved the recovery time, as well as pulmonary and cardiac outcome after CABG, when compared with IV postoperative pain treatment after intraoperative GA with sufentanil and midazolam.", 
    "99": "Hemodynamic changes were studied during two different anesthetic techniques in 54 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). All patients had normal to moderately impaired left ventricular function and were randomly assigned to two groups. In 27 patients, high thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with bupivacaine 0.375% plus sufentanil 1:200,000 (ie, 5 micrograms/mL) was used in combination with general anesthesia with midazolam/N2O; in the other 27 patients, general anesthesia (GA) with midazolam and sufentanil was used. After induction of epidural analgesia, heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased. Changes in cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were not observed, whereas the stroke volume index increased significantly. After induction of intravenous anesthesia MAP decreased (20%) in both groups. During the pre-bypass period, metaraminol was used in 7 of 27 patients in the GA group and in 5 of 27 patients in the TEA group to treat hypotension. Inotopic drugs were used in 5 patients in the GA group and in none in the TEA group to treat a low CO. Ten GA patients and 4 TEA patients developed hypertension after sternal spread and the GA patients required more nitroprusside. Four GA patients developed electrocardiographic evidence of prebypass ischemia and, therefore, more nitroglycerin was needed for treating myocardial ischemia. More sodium nitroprusside was needed in the GA group during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the post-bypass period to treat hypertension with a high SVR. In conclusion, hemodynamic stability was more pronounced in the TEA than the GA group before and after CPB.",

The plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations correlated well with the temazepam dose but even better with the weight standardised dose (r = 0.65, p = 0.0003 and r = 0.75, p = 0.00001 respectively). Both the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of temazepam were correlated with the patient's sedation (r = 0.42 p = 0.037, and r = 0.46 p = 0.021 respectively), but neither was strong.

    "101": "A semi-quantitative estimation has been made of the effect of anaesthetics, anticonvulsants and glutamate antagonists on the extent of neuronal loss in the hippocampus caused by the local injection of the excitotoxin kainic acid, and on the vulnerability of neurons in various extrahippocampal regions due to the resulting seizure activity. Following the intrahippocampal injection of 0.47 nmol kainic acid (a submaximal dose), the amount of neuronal loss in the dorsal hippocampus was greater when given under the short-acting anaesthetics halothane and ketamine (a non-competitive glutamate antagonist), than when given under pentobarbital anaesthesia (with or without co-administration of ketamine (30 mg/kg)). When kainic acid was injected under halothane or ketamine anaesthesia a greater number of extrahippocampal limbic regions (distal toxicity) were also affected, usually on the ipsilateral side, and the extent of damage in each of these regions was generally more extensive. The anticonvulsants MK 801 and diazepam, or multiple injections of ketamine over a period of 5 h, decreased both the local and distal toxicity of kainic acid injected under short duration anaesthesia, to levels similar to those found under pentobarbital anaesthesia. However, these compounds, even at high doses, could not reliably prevent all seizure-related damage in extrahippocampal areas.", 
    "102": "Ethanol alters almost all membrane functions, but it behaves essentially like a benzodiazepine-type GABAergic agonist. The mechanism by which ethanol affects the GABA/benzodiazepine complex is not clear. We studied the possible changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding induced by chronic ethanol treatment, using light microscopic autoradiography, to try to elucidate the controversy underlying this topic. This technique allows us to measure densities of benzodiazepine receptors in different anatomical brain areas--visual cortex and hippocampus--which seem to constitute the anatomical support for the behavioral and physiological responses affected by ethanol. Autoradiographic studies on the visual cortex and hippocampus from rats chronically treated with ethanol do not show statistically significant differences in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam with respect to control animals. Furthermore, we did not find either rostro-caudal or medio-lateral differences in benzodiazepine receptor densities in each layer of the visual cortex."
