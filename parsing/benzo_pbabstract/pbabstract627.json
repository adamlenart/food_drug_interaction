    "0": "In the present study, the effect of various stimulant drugs on the action of chlordiazepoxide to increase punished responding was studied. Drugs such as d-amphetamine, methylphenidate and imipramine that are effective in attentional deficit disorder (MBD) were found to reverse this benzodiazepine-induced increase in responding. Phenobarbital which worsens this condition enhanced the benzodiazepine effect. Since the impairment caused by chlordiazepoxide may be analogous to the lack of impulse control noted in MBD, the bupropion antagonism of this action of chlordiazepoxide suggests that bupropion may be useful in MBD.", 
    "1": "Blood gas analysis was performed before and 1 h after 10 mg oral diazepam premedication on 50 adult male patients undergoing different surgical operations. There was a significant (p less than 0.01) decrease in arterial oxygen tension, a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in alveolar--arterial oxygen tension difference, and no significant change in arterial carbon dioxide tension or pH after administration of the drug. It is concluded that diazepam given by mouth 1 h before operation increases venous admixture. It is suggested therefore that oral diazepam premedication should be given cautiously to patients with impaired cardiorespiratory reserve, preferably without adding a narcotic drug.", 
    "2": "Sodium Valproate (VPA) administered to rats in a dose of 10 or 200 mg/kg IP suppressed the slow negative wave (SNW) and photically-induced afterdischarge (SAD) of VEP (when they were present) within 15-30 min. The recovery of VEP amplitude began at 3 hr. This effect was antagonized by subconvulsive doses of convulsant benzodiazepine RO 5-3663 (2 mg/kg) and metrazol (15 mg/kg) but not by picrotoxin (2 mg/kg) and naloxone (10 mg/kg). The SNW suppression may be attributed to a disinhibitory action of a system located presynaptically on recurrent collaterals of the output neurons, or nerve terminals of inhibitory interneurons or both. Alternative conjecture suggests that VPA depolarizes the dendritic tree masking thereby somatic inhibition produced by recurrent circuits.", 
    "3": "Diazepam and (--)-pentobarbital each potentiate the increase in chloride ion conductance produced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) i voltage-clamped mouse spinal neurons grown in culture. Fluctuation analysis was used to compare the properties of elementary ion-channel events underlying the chloride conductance produced by GABA alone and during potentiation by the two drugs. Neither drug altered the conductance of an open ion channel, but both drugs affected the kinetics of channel activity. Diazepam increased the frequency of channel openings and either did not affect or slightly increased the average open-channel lifetime, whereas (--)-pentobarbital decreased the frequency of channel openings and increased average open-channel lifetime. These changes in the kinetics of GABA-activated ion channels can quantitatively account for the potentiation of GABA responses observed with the drugs. Thus, the drugs each increase the response to GABA but do not act on channel kinetics in the same manner.", 
    "4": "High-affinity GABA and benzodiazepine receptors were localized by light microscopic autoradiography in the developing rat cerebellum. [3H]muscimol was used for the labeling of GABA receptors and [3H]flunitrazepam for benzodiazepine receptors. Very low densities of GABA sites were found during the first postnatal week. GABA receptors start increasing linearly at the end of the second week up to adult levels around the fourth postnatal week. The increase in receptor density is concentrated in the developing granule cell layer. Benzodiazepine receptors are present at birth and increases in the density of receptors were observed already during the first postnatal week. Receptor concentrations reached adult values around the third to fourth weeks postnatally. The increase in benzodiazepine receptors in concentrated in the growing molecular layer with little change in the granule cell layer. The immature cell of the external granule layer were characterized by the absence of receptor sites. At least partial association of high-affinity GABA receptors with granule cells and benzodiazepine receptor with Purkinje cell dendrites is suggested by these developmental profiles.", 
    "5": "The effects of pentobarbitone on the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to crude synaptosomal rat brain membranes were studied. In extensively washed P2 membranes, pentobarbitone had a biphasic action: at concentrations ranging between 12.5 and 500 microM, pentobarbitone enhanced GABA binding in a concentration-dependent manner; at concentrations greater than 500 microM, this enhancement was progressively reversed towards control levels of GABA binding. The effect of pentobarbitone seen at higher concentrations may reflect a GABA-mimetic action, since similar concentrations enhanced diazepam binding to washed P2 membranes, an effect antagonized by bicuculline methochloride and picrotoxinin. When washed P2 membranes were incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 (30 min at 37 degrees C), the enhancement of GABA binding by low concentrations of pentobarbitone was abolished, while at higher concentrations GABA binding was progressively inhibited, suggesting that the GABA-mimetic action is retained. When washed P2 membranes were subjected to high-frequency homogenization, the biphasic dose-response relationship for pentobarbitone was markedly shifted to the right. The choice of membrane preparation appears to be a critical factor in examining drug-receptor interactions in vitro, at least for those involving GABA and the barbiturates.", 
    "6": "Premedication with PCPA antagonized in rats the anticonvulsant activity of Primidone and of other drugs against seizures evoked by electroshock. Only in the case of Primidone, however, the anticonvulsant activity could not be re-established by increasing the dosage. Our investigations have shown that PCPA caused a strong inhibition of the conversion of Primidone to phenobarbital, both in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "7": "Benzodiazepines given intravenously abort status epilepticus, and abolish paroxysmal EEG discharges. The study reported concerns the effect of small doses (about 1 mg) of lorazepam on these EEG changes, assessed visually, in the resting record, as well as during overbreathing and photic stimulation. Thirty patients were examined, approximately half had primary generalised and the remainder focal epilepsy. All showed rapid reduction of paroxysms in the first few minutes following injection. This occurred faster and was much more persistent for the generalised than for the focal group. The effect of chronic oral administration of lorazepam in these patients is under investigation.", 
    "8": "Twenty patients have been monitored over a period of six months, in order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of triazolam in the treatment of chronic and sometimes refractory insomnia. The treatment group consisted of twelve chronic in-patients of a specialized institution and eight out-patients treated by a psychiatrist. There were two female drop-outs: one did not show up anymore for unknown reasons, in the other a pregnancy was diagnosed during the third week of treatment. We have found that the optimum mean dose stabilizes approximately around 0,5 mg of triazolam given as a single dose H. S.: slightly higher for the in-patients and slightly lower for the out-patients. This estate of stabilisation is always attained as from the second month and is achieved in a period between four and six months. The tolerance appeared to be excellent, only one fourth of the patients described the classical benzodiazepinen side-effects which never warranted discontinuation of treatment. The efficacy appeared to remain constant after establishing the optimum dosage for every patient. Indeed after the second month the same dosage could be continued in all patients without any need to increase it in order to maintain the desired effect.", 
    "9": "The clinical efficacy and safety of alprazolam was compared to lorazepam in a double blind randomized design involving 82 out-patients suffering from primary anxiety. Seventy four patients (37 on alprazolam and 37 on lorazepam) were evaluable. They were treated with a flexible dose of 0,75 mg to 3 mg of alprazolam per day (average final dose: 1,59 mg) or 3 mg to 12 mg of lorazepam per day (average final dose: 5,97 mg). The results show that the two drugs produce similar efficacious effects at weeks 2 and 4 of the treatment as evaluated using both patient and physician scales. At week 1, as could be expected from an average daily dose of 0,99 mg of alprazolam and of 4,14 mg of lorazepam, efficacy parameters favored lorazepam. Fifty seven side effects were reported in the 37 lorazepam patients while 61 side effects were reported in the 37 alprazolam patients.", 
    "10": "During a double-blind clinical study, a new hypnotic benzodiazepine, lormetazepam (Wy 4082), was compared at a fixed dose of 1 mg to sodium amobarbital at a fixed dose of 100 mg for the treatment of moderate insomnia in 2 groups of 25 psychiatric outpatients. The medication was given at bedtime and the duration of the study was limited to 2 weeks. The quality of sleep was evaluated by the patient after the first night and at the end of the first and second week and by investigator at the end of the 2 weeks trial. The two products appeared effective on global assessment, but with an advantage in favour of lormetazepam: earlier onset of sleep and excellent acceptability on the final evaluation. Fifty two per cent of patients treated with amobarbital had side effects, mainly hangover and sedation during the morning, while only one patient treated with lormetazepam complained of headaches in the morning.", 
    "11": "Content of 14C-phenazepame and its metabolites was studied in feces and urine of mice strains C57BL/6 and BALB/ c after intraperitoneal administration of the preparation at a dose of 14 mg/kg. Concentration of phenazepame and of its trihydroderivative was higher in urine of the BALB/c strain mice than in C57BL/6 strain that corresponded to genetic differences of the tranquilizer metabolism in the animal strains studied.", 
    "12": "Anxiety is a frequent symptom seen in a variety of clinical settings. Recognizing that therapeutic interventions (including drugs) can be costly and may involve potential risks, treatment of anxiety should proceed with some care. As outlined in Table 3, the first step is to establish a diagnosis, determining whether the anxiety is secondary to primary medical or psychiatric disorders. The remaining significant anxiety states fall into acute situational disturbances (best treated with benzodiazepines on a short-term basis) and the primary anxiety disorders. In each case, counseling or psychotherapy may be appropriate. Treatment of primary anxiety disorders is probably best accomplished by a combination of behavior interventions and, when necessary, temporary use of psychotropic drugs. The specific behavior intervention varies with the disorder (Table 6) and ranges from systematic desensitization or immersion techniques (for phobias) to thought stopping or aversion relief (for obsessive-compulsive behavior) to paradoxical intention (for panic disorders). Temporary use of tricyclic antidepressants or MAO inhibitors (probably equally effective) should be considered in the major anxiety disorders when panic attacks become frequent or subjective anxiety levels become intolerably high. Treatment of situational anxiety usually rests with counseling. When functioning is impaired, benzodiazepines can be most helpful as antianxiety agents or as hypnotics (e.g., flurazepam) for periods not to exceed 2-3 weeks.", 
    "13": "Uridine diphosphoglucuronyltransferase activity toward morphine was measured in vitro in preparations of human fetal liver microsomes. The inhibition of the glucuronidation of morphine was studied at concentrations of morphine and uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid of 3 and 15 mM, respectively. Oxazepam inhibited the reaction by about 50% at concentration of 0.3 mM. The inhibition was almost complete when the concentration was 3 mM, i.e., the same as for morphine. Salicylamide was considerably less potent as an inhibitor of morphine glucuronidation with an almost 100-fold difference in potency as compared to oxazepam. Lineweaver-Burk plots of the inhibition data revealed that oxazepam exerts a competitive type of inhibition with an apparent Ki value of 0.2 mM.", 
    "14": "1 The effects of age and sex on the disposition of clobazam (CBZ), a 1.5-benzodiazepine derivative, were evaluated in a series of 29 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 72 years, who ingested single 20 mg oral doses. CBZ kinetics were determined from multiple plasma concentrations measured during 7 days after the dose. 2 CBZ was rapidly absorbed, with peak levels reached an average of 1.5 h after dosing (range 0.5--2.5 h). Mean absorption half-life was 19.7 min. Absorption kinetics were not influenced by age of sex. 3 Elimination half-life ranged from 11 to 77 h, and was significantly longer in elderly v young males (48 v 17 h, P less than 0.01). In women, half-life also increased with age, but differences between young and elderly women were less striking (31 v 49 h, P less than 0.05). 4 Volume of distribution (Vd) was influenced by age and sex. Vd became larger with age regardless of sex, and within each age group was larger in women than in men. Total clearance was unrelated to age in women, but declined significantly with age in men (P less than 0.01). 5 The mean free fraction for CBZ in plasma was 11.5% (range 8.6--15.0%), and tended to increase with age, partly due to a significant age-related decline in plasma albumin concentration (r = -0.68, P less than 0.001). Correction of Vd and clearance for individual differences in binding did not alter their relation to age and sex. 6 As in the case of other benzodiazepines biotransformed by oxidative pathways, the capacity for N-demethylation of CBZ declines with age in men, but age has a minimal effect on CBZ clearance in women.", 
    "15": "The advantages of the benzodiazpines as oral premedicants are: clear anxiolytic and sedative effect; less clear amnesic action which may prevent the recall of the time spent lying on an uncomfortable theatre trolley, but not necessarily recall of the journey to the operating theatre, or induction of anaesthesia; convenient route of administration; long duration of action of 5-8 h which simplifies timing of drug administration; adverse autonomic, hormonal and circulatory system reactions seem to be prevented, thus preventing the stress reaction even before induction of anaesthesia; anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing actions may be of value in patients receiving local anaesthesia, or in preventing the side-effects of depolarizing muscle relaxants; nausea before and after operation may be decreased; reduced frequency of side-effects before and after operation.", 
    "16": "A simple model system for the behavioral actions of benzodiazepines is analyzed for its dose-response predictiveness, using several benzodiazepines, and for its pharmacological specificity, using other non-anxiolytic classes of psychoactive drugs. The model demonstrates an increase in mouse exploratory activity between a brighty-lit open field and a small, dark compartment by clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate, but not by the peripheral benzodiazepine R05-4864, nor by clorgyline, butriptyline, or chlorpromazine.", 
    "17": "We treated 61 patients with seizures refractory to conventional anticonvulsants by adding clorazepate to their regimen. There was some improvement of seizure control, but no overall improvement in the electroencephalogram. Improvement of seizure control was not significantly related to seizure type. No significant side effects, drug interactions, or laboratory abnormalities were noted with doses up to 3 mg per kilogram per day.", 
    "18": "Visual reaction time as a measure of vigilance and of the psychophysiological condition of subjects, was determined after combined physical and mental stress to examine the influence of beta blockade. Using the technique of electro-oculography, 40 subjects aged 25.7 +/- 6 years, with a mean blood pressure of 126/79 torr, were studied in a double-blind crossover design after application of placebo or 50 mg atenolol for 3 d. Visual reaction time was defined as the time between display of a peripheral light signal and the start of the eye movement that shifts the direction of gaze from the reference point to the stimulus. The results of the study show that, under these experimental conditions, there is a positive effect of beta blocker medication on vigilance. Findings of other authors are discussed. To prove the sensitivity of the test method in a preliminary study, the effects of the well-known drugs fenethylline-hydrochioride, diazepam, oxazepam, and alcohol on visual reaction time were investigated.", 
    "19": "The effect-kinetics of the new benzodiazepine midazolam was evaluated in six subjects after single oral (7.5 and 15 mg) and intravenous (0.075 mg/kg) doses and infusion programs. The drug is bound to plasma proteins by 94%, and less than 0.5% is excreted unchanged in urine. Hepatic elimination is rapid: t1/2 beta is 2.4 +/- 0.8 hr (mean +/- S.D) and total body clearance is 283 +/- 43 ml/min (plasma) or 502 +/- 105 ml/min (blood). This substantial first-pass effect leads to bioavailability of only 44%, despite very rapid absorption (t1/2abs = 0.23 +/- 0.37 hr) after oral dosing. There is good intraindividual linear correlations (r between 0.68 and 0.97) between plasma levels and dynamic effects, as assessed by the d2 letter cancellation test and a sedation index formed from visual analogue scales.", 
    "20": "Nausea and vomiting are frequent and unpleasant side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Current concepts of pathophysiology and clinical aspects of nausea and vomiting are reviewed. Individual and therapeutic factors are discussed which greatly modify the degree of vomiting. The commercially available antiemetics are tabulated and the individual classes of antiemetics are described. Finally, consideration is given to new approaches to the treatment of nausea and vomiting, including the search for new compounds and better use of currently available agents.", 
    "21": "The binding of [3H] diazepam and [3H] flunitrazepam in rat cerebral cortex was not altered by either acute or chronic administration of pentylenetetrazol except in rats made to convulse 30 min before sacrifice. Rats treated for up to 6 months with doses of pentylenetetrazol which are below seizure threshold in naive rats, became increasingly sensitive to the CNS stimulant effect of pentylenetetrazol as demonstrated by the development of myoclonus and convulsions during treatment periods. These effects were not correlated with any changes in benzodiazepine binding in cerebral cortex or cerebellum and [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate binding in cerebral cortex. Acute convulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol increased benzodiazepine binding in cerebral cortex, but only in those rats which actively convulsed. Benzodiazepine and cholinergic receptors of the cortex, and benzodiazepine receptors of the cerebellum, therefore, do not appear to change with either the acute or chronic subconvulsive administration of pentylenetetrazol.", 
    "22": "This is a review of 963 cases of self-poisoning with drugs (8.5% of all medical emergencies) treated in the three major Newcastle hospitals over a 3 1/2-year period. The number of patients admitted rose from 243 (July 1976 to June 1977) to 326 (January to December, 1979)-an overall increase of 34%. The most common drugs used were benzodiazepines (34.9% of cases); barbiturates (11.2%); tricyclic depressants (9.2%); paracetamol (8.1%) and phenothiazines (6.2%). In four of 134 cases involving barbiturates, phenobarbitone had been used as part of an anticonvulsant regimen. Six patients died in hospital and 31 who committed suicide with drugs were not admitted to the hospital, but were investigated by the Regional Forensic Pathologist.", 
    "23": "On 3 days (1, 8, 15) the acute (on day 1) and subacute (days 8 und 15) effects of bromazepam (Lexotanil) on variables of driving ability were studied in 55 young male medical students, randomly divided into 3 groups (placebo, 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg). The drug was well tolerated (no notable side effects). Dose-effects showed trends in group 3 (3.0 mg) with a stronger subjective impression of performance impairment which was, however, not confirmed by objective performance assessment, although time of reaction to optical stimuli was significantly longer after the 3 mg dose. In the discussion, it is pointed out that the results of this type of study in healthy subjects can only be regarded as indicative.", 
    "24": "The distribution and kinetics of [11C]flunitrazepam in the brain were studied by positron emission tomography in the living baboon. Flunitrazepam was labelled on the methyl group with the 20 min positron emitter carbon 11. Fifteen to 25 mCi corresponding to 15-30 nmol were injected i.v. and sequential tomographic pictures of the brain were obtained. In some experiments, therapeutic doses of various benzodiazepines were injected i.v. subsequently in order to study the displacement of the radioactive ligand from brain structures. Lorazepam was shown to displace [11C]flunitrazepam from brain tissue, although other benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, Ro 116896 and Ro 116893) led to a redistribution of the radioactive ligand in the body accompanied by an increase of brain radioactivity.", 
    "25": "The specific photoaffinity labeling of membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized benzodiazepine binding sites has been investigated using UV irradiated [3H] flunitrazepam as a photochemical probe. The time course and the regional and pharmacological specificity of the photolabeling reaction has been determined for \"brain-specific\" benzodiazepine binding sites; \"peripheral-type\" binding sites treated in an identical manner were not specifically labeled. Comparison of the number of sites labeled and blocked by [3H]flunitrazepam photolabeling of detergent-solubilized preparations indicated that about one site was blocked and unavailable for reversible binding for each site photolabeled. In contrast, when membrane-bound sites were photolabeled, about four sites were inactivated for each site photolabeled. Examination of photolabeled binding sites from various brain regions including cortex, striatum, and hippocampus using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave only a single labeled band of apparent Mr = 48,000.", 
    "26": "Plasma concentrations of diazepam and its major active metabolite nordiazepam were measured in 108 neurosurgical patients taking diazepam in doses of 5 to 40 mg/day for periods from one month to 16 years. Diazepam was used for relief of pain or muscle spasm, or anxiety and sleeplessness associated with these two symptoms, and was considered to be beneficial by 83% of the patients, although use of other drugs confounded this evaluation. Concentrations of total diazepam-nordiazepam ranged from 0 to 2,584 ng/mL, with nordiazepam being the predominant metabolite. \"Low\" concentrations (less than 250 ng/mL) were found in 35 of the 108 patients, with 19 having concentrations lower than 100 ng/mL. \"High\" concentrations (greater than 900 ng/mL) were found in 20 patients and did not occur more frequently than in other studies of long-term diazepam ingestion. Even with long-term use, diazepam seemed to retain its efficacy and did not lead to any clear-cut abuse.", 
    "27": "A form for recording acute toxicological cases has been preliminarily applied to a sample of 436 subjects admitted during 1978 into the hospitals of two districts of the Venetian Region. One was predominately manufacture and industry, and the other a mountain-agricultural area. The latter had medical facilities less uniformly distributed. Through epidemiological analysis, the acute poisoning cases from psychoactive drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, antipsychotic agents, and tricyclic antidepressants) prevailed (37.9%). They were followed by acute cases from street heroin or other opiates in addicts (25.7%) that only occurred in the main town of the more industrialized district. The incidence of the other poisoning cases were in the following decreasing order: household poisons (9.8%), nonnarcotic analgesics (5.1%), agricultural poisons (4.1%), cardiovascular drugs (3.7%), miscellaneous drugs (1.4%), food and plants (1.4%), oral contraceptives (1.0%), viper envenomization (0.7%), and insect bites (0.7%). A rate of 8.5% was due to unidentified compounds. Mortality was 0.9% and death occurred after exposure to corrosives, carbon monoxide, or undetermined substances. Between the two districts there were no marked differences in emergency and general measures that mainly consisted in supportive treatment with forced diuresis (13.9%) and gastric lavage (only 21.4%).", 
    "28": "The kinetic profiles and antileptazol activity of clobazam and its main metabolite were compared to assess the metabolite's contribution to the anticonvulsant activity of clobazam in the guinea-pig. The metabolite was less effective than the parent compound in terms of doses and active brain levels. However, the metabolite formed after clobazam administration accounted for the persistence of antileptazol activity in this animal species.", 
    "29": "The metabolic rate of 14C-phenazepam (14 mg/kg) in male C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice and F1 hybrids (BALB/c X C57BL/6) and the anticonvulsant effect of the tranquilizer in hybrid mice were studied. It was demonstrated that oxidation of the phenazepam molecule in the third position in BALB/c mice and in F1 hybrids proceeded at a higher rate than in C57BL/6 mice. The sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effect of phenazepam in C57BL/6 animals was greater than in BALB/c mice and F1 hybrids.", 
    "30": "Effects of paleocortex electrical stimulation on multifocal epileptic complex of the brain cortex alone and in combination with benzodiazepines (diazepam, phenazepam) were investigated in experiments on cats. The animals developed complex reactions which included the increased frequency of seizure potentials during stimulation, their suppression after the cessation of stimulation and the postsuppression rise of frequency (dyssuppression). This points to the dualistic character of cerebellar effects on the brain cortex. On being administered before stimulation benzo-diazepines significantly changed the above effects: activation and dyssuppression first disappeared, whereas the suppression of the epileptic activity in the brain cortex remained unchanged.", 
    "31": "The author determined the distribution coefficients (in n-octanol/water) and the RM values (thin-layer chromatographically, using two solvent systems) of 17 newly synthetized pyridazines. These determinations evidenced that the majority of these compounds are relatively polar. Altogether the acute toxicity of the compounds under investigation may be regarded as weak, because LD50 values could be determined for only 10 of the orally applied 17 pyridazines. The characteristic features of acute toxicity caused by high doses of the compounds under investigation were a stimulation of the central nervous system associated with convulsions or a depressant action on the central nervous system. The screening tests performed to date do not permit to classify the compounds under investigation into defined groups of substances action on the central nervous system. In conjunction with data from the literature, the possible mechanisms of the attack of these novel pyridazines on the central nervous system are discussed.", 
    "32": "Rectal administration of diazepam is highly effective in terminating absence status as judged by reduction of spike-wave activity in the EEG. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that diazepam can have antiepileptic properties at serum levels well below those previously reported as being necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect.", 
    "33": "A form of combination anaesthesia using ketamine, diazepam, alcuronium and nitrous oxide was used in 41 patients over 65 years requiring abdominal surgery. The patients were premedicated with droperidol 2.5-7.5 mg im. At induction the patients received diazepam 5 mg. ketamine 2 mg/kg and alcuronium 0.2 mg/kg. Anaesthesia was maintained with a continuous, steady injection of ketamine 2.5 mg/kg/h and nitrous oxide-oxygen with controlled ventilation. Four minutes before incision the patients received 1 ml of coded solution and at the end of anaesthesia the same solution, which contained either 5 mg/ml diazepam or its solvent only. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups, i.e. patients receiving either 15 or 5 mg of diazepam. The incidence of bad dreams was 5 per cent, i.e. one patient in each group. Only one patient vomited and one had pronounced nausea in group D5. According to the anaesthesiologist's, the anaesthesia nurse's and the patient's subjective evaluations this type of combination anaesthesia was found to be highly acceptable. Despite there being no statistically significant differences between the patients who received 5 + 5 + 5 mg of diazepam compared to those receiving 5 + 0 + 0 mg, the figures in results per se incline in favour of the use of 5 + 5 + 5 of diazepam.", 
    "34": "The sorption of diazepam in large-volume i.v. admixtures to administration-set components and in i.v. containers was analyzed quantitatively. Solubility of diazepam in phosphate buffer at various pH levels and in i.v. fluids was measured. Partition coefficients of diazepam into components of i.v. administration sets and i.v. containers were studied by shaking a solution of diazepam in 0.9% sodium chloride, with finely cut components and measuring the change in diazepam in the aqueous phase. Flow studies through an administration set of a 0.04-mg/ml diazepam solution in 5% dextrose injection were done, varying both the flow rate and the length of tubing. The maximum free-base solubility of diazepam in phosphate buffer was 0.048 mg/ml; its solubility was 0.058, 0.050, and 0.064 mg/ml in lactated Ringer's, 0.9% sodium chloride, and 5% dextrose injections, respectively. Equilibrium partition coefficients were highest for polyvinyl chloride tubing and flexible bags. Volume-control sets made of cellulose propionate had lower but sufficiently large partition coefficients to cause diazepam loss. Polyolefin semi-rigid and glass containers had low partition coefficients. In the flow studies, the amount of solution-contact time correlated with the extent of absorption. As flow rate decreased or tubing length increased, the amount of diazepam absorbed increased proportionately. A nomogram and a predictive dosing chart are presented for calculation of actual diazepam doses delivered at various flow rates and tubing lengths. Diazepam can be administered safely and effectively by i.v. infusion. The use of volume-control sets and flexible polyvinyl chloride bags should be avoided with diazepam solutions. Polyolefin semi-rigid containers are acceptable alternatives to glass. The concentration of diazepam infusions should not exceed 0.04 mg/ml.", 
    "35": "Adenosine and its immediate metabolites, inosine and hypoxanthine, were measured in mouse brain following the induction of electroshock seizures and after a subconvulsive series of electric shocks. Electroshock seizures resulted in a marked and prolonged rise in inosine, with maximal values at 5 min. Hypoxanthine increased more slowly but reached high levels by 10 min. Adenosine was unchanged. Phenytoin and to a lesser extent phenobarbital reduced these effects. Following the subconvulsive stimulus, 15 single shocks over an interval of 5 sec, inosine increased rapidly, adenosine rose slightly, and hypoxanthine did not change. Both phenytoin and phenobarbital blocked these increases in adenosine and inosine. Early elevations in inosine may play some role in seizure generation and propagation. The high levels of inosine and hypoxanthine found after recovery may be involved in the termination of epileptic activity, possibly by interacting with the benzodiazepine receptor for which they are ligands.", 
    "36": "Single doses of diazepam induced peak impairment of performance on cognitive and psychomotor tasks early (20 min after ingestion), when blood levels had reached less than two thirds of their eventual plateau. Alcohol did not have this effect. Early peak impairment and the acute tolerance that follows it contribute greatly to the lack of correlation between diazepam plasma level and performance impairment.", 
    "37": "The effect of cimetidine (1000 mg/day) on steady-state diazepam (5 mg/day) kinetics was investigated in six healthy subjects. During placebo-controlled treatment for 11 days, trough steady-state plasma levels were 130 +/- 33 ng/ml and steady-state concentration averaged 185 +/- 57 ng/ml (mean +/- SD). During concomitant treatment with diazepam and cimetidine these concentrations rose to 194 +/- 52 ng/ml and 255 +/- 46 ng/ml (P less than 0.002). The 40% to 50% increase was due to reduction (P = 0.026) of total body clearance from 20.9 +/- 9.5 ml/min (control) to 14.0 +/- 3.0 ml/min (with cimetidine). Diazepam elimination half-life was also prolonged (P = 0.02, from 39.5 +/- 16.6 hr to 101 +/- 58.1 hr) by cimetidine.", 
    "38": "Twenty-six healthy subjects from 19 to 85 yr old took single 15-mg doses of flurazepam (FLZ). Concentrations of desalkylfurazepam (DAFLZ), its principal metabolite, were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in multiple samples drawn 7 or more days after the dose. For the first 6 to 8 hr after drug, several additional FLZ metabolites appeared in plasma, but only DAFLZ was detected from 12 hr onward. Its elimination half-life (t1/2) (range, 37 to 289 hr) was longer in elderly than in young men (mean 74 and 160 hr, p less than 0.05), but t1/2 in young and elderly women was much the same (90 and 120 hr, P = NS). Eighteen of the 26 subjects then received FLZ, 15 mg, nightly for 15 consecutive nights. Blood samples were drawn during FLZ dosage and in the withdrawal period, and morning self-ratings of mood and sleep patterns were obtained using visual analogue scales. DAFLZ cumulation was extensive, with a mean cumulation ratio of 7.5. Mean steady-state plasma levels of DAFLZ were higher in elderly than in young men (81 and 53 ng/ml, P less than 0.05), but values were essentially the same in elderly and young women (85 and 86 ng/ml). Single-dose t1/2 correlated with washout t1/2 after termination of FLZ treatment (r = 0.87, P less than 0.01). Clinical self-ratings indicated increases over time in perception of morning sedation; changes slowly reverted to baseline in the week after dosage. Sleep patterns also improved on FLZ (shortened latency, longer duration, \"deeper\" sleep). After termination of treatment, sleep parameters returned to baseline with a suggestion of \"overshoot\" sleep disturbance at days 5 and 7 after drug. There was no evidence of increased sensitivity to FLZ in the elderly. Subjects did not perceive any impairment of intellectual function or motor performance, and no other adverse reactions were reported.", 
    "39": "Spasticity may be a major obstacle to rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injury. It may cause discomfort, interfere with existing functions, or result in additional complications. Many techniques-physical, chemical, and surgical- exist for modulation of spasticity. Prevention of nociception and establishment of an effective daily stretching program are the foundation on which all other managements are based. Antispasticity medications may be added: benzodiazepines, dantrolene sodium, and baclofen are effective in selected patients. Motor point blocks may partially dampen spasticity in selected muscles of some patients. Chemical and surgical neurolytic procedures are used if the first two tiers of management are inadequate. Each technique can be rationally applied by use of a pyramidal management system.", 
    "40": "A 41-year-old man in deep coma after drug overdosage showed electroencephalographic activity of alpha frequency. He remained comatose for 20 hours, and assisted ventilation was required for 28 hours, but he eventually recovered. Alpha coma has generally been considered to have grave prognostic implications, but acute drug intoxication is an exception to this rule. Intensive supportive therapy is important.", 
    "41": "The pharmacological profiles of psychotropic drugs, chlorpromazine, diazepam, imipramine, morphine, barbital, cocaine, d-amphetamine, and LSD-25, at various doses were compared in terms of gross behavioral observations in rhesus monkeys. At each observation 4 monkeys maintained in group cages were used, with 2 out of 4 being administered the compound and the other 2 being administered vehicle as control. The findings were scored against predetermined criteria. In order to compare profiles, items to sensitively reflect the influence of psychotropic drugs were selected, namely apprehension, spontaneous motor activity, alertness, motor function, tremor, pupil size, and salivation. The preadministration scores of these items were subtracted from the corresponding scores at various time following administration, with the absolute values of all items at each time being added together and graphed. Next, the profiles during the peaks on the graphs were expressed as histograms. If the histograms of 2 or more drugs at 4 times their minimum effective doses showed common tendencies in 3 or more items, or if common tendencies were noted in only 2 items but with no opposing tendencies in any other items, these drugs were collected into a group. The result was the following classification by profile: 1) chlorpomazine, diazepam, morphine, barbital; 2) d-amphetamine, cocaine; 3) imipramine; 4) LSD-25. These results may be interpreted as indicating that the characteristics of the effects of psychotropic drugs may be determined by gross behavioral observation in rhesus monkeys.", 
    "42": "Different effects of methamphetamine (0.25-1 mg/kg, sc), chlorpromazine (0.5-2 mg/kg, sc), haloperidol (0.25-0.1 mg/kg, sc), diazepam (1-4 mg/kg, sc) and pentobarbital (5-20 mg/kg, sc) on Sidman avoidance response were investigated according to absence or presence of stimulus control. Thirteen adult male rats of Wistar strain were divided into two groups of 6 and 7 each, and trained under Sidman avoidance schedule (WS-group) and the same schedule associated with a 5 sec warning stimulus presentation (buzzer and light) (WS+group). There was no difference in the effect of methamphetamine between the two groups. The avoidance response was inhibited in dose-dependent manner regardless of the stimulus control after chlorpromazine and haloperidol. However, more marked inhibition was always observed in WS-group than in WS+group. Diazepam and pentobarbital also inhibited the avoidance response in WS-group when ataxia-producing doses were given, while no significant inhibition was observed after the same doses of the drugs in WS+group. Thus, the avoidance response without stimulus control was more susceptible to the drugs than that with stimulus control. The present results suggest that Sidman avoidance response is reliable to evaluate psychotropic drugs in screening test.", 
    "43": "General anesthetics, ganglionic blocking agents, anticonvulsants, and antioxidants have been shown to afford protection from seizures caused by exposure to hyperbaric oxygen. In the present study cats were exposed to 5 ATA oxygen in pairs in a hyperbaric chamber until both the control and pretreated cat convulsed or for a maximum 120 min exposure. Small amounts of four common antiepileptic agents and propylene glycol in amounts far less than previously reported (0.1 to 0.2 ml/kg) were initially tested for potential anticonvulsant activity. Two agents, clonazepam and propylene glycol, offered significant protection in delaying the onset of seizures whereas carbamazepine, valproic acid, and trimethadione appeared to hasten the onset of seizure activity. The time to seizures was increased nearly five times by clonazepam and over three times by very small amounts of propylene glycol.", 
    "44": "1 Six healthy male volunteers received single oral doses of 10 mg diazepam, 20 mg temazepam, 15 mg flurazepam, 5 mg nitrazepam, 10 mg desmethyl-diazepam and placebo in a double-blind randomized fashion. 2 Peak velocity of saccadic eye movements, serum benzodiazepine concentration, and subjective ratings of wakefulness and co-ordination were measured at intervals up to 12 h after drug administration. 3 All active treatments produced a statistically significant decrease in peak saccadic velocity. The effect of temazepam and diazepam was generally more pronounced than that of flurazepam, nitrazepam and desmethyl-diazepam. 4 There were log-linear correlations between peak saccadic velocity and serum benzodiazepine concentration after ingestion of temazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam. 5 These results demonstrate a clear relationship between serum benzodiazepine concentration and its effect on a convenient measure of brainstem reticular formation function.", 
    "45": "The respiratory effects of premedication with i.v. injection of diazepam have been assessed in 10 healthy patients awaiting minor operative procedures. Measurements were recorded before and 60 min after administration of diazepam 0.14 mg kg-1. Mouth occlusion pressure (P 0.1) was used as an index of neuromuscular inspiratory drive. Minute-ventilation (VE), respiratory frequency (f) and mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI) were significantly reduced after diazepam. During carbon dioxide rebreathing the slopes of VE, f, VT/TI and P 0.1 with PACO2, were significantly reduced. These results confirm that i.v. diazepam produces significant respiratory depression in healthy subjects. We conclude that diazepam used under clinical conditions depresses the respiratory centre.", 
    "46": "The postictal immobility syndrome was examined in five experimental grand mal epilepsy models in an attempt to analyze separately the behavioral and underlying neurochemical aspects of the rigid-catatonic and flaccid-cataleptic states. Catalepsy and analgesia were found in varying degrees after maximal electroshock (MES), metrazol, picrotoxin, and Ro 5-3663 activated seizures. Signs of rigidity were noticed after the MES and picrotoxin seizures. Kindled seizures were followed by explosive behavior without signs of rigidity, catalepsy, and analgesia. Naloxone reduced the duration but not the score (intensity) of catalepsy and failed to selectively antagonize analgesia. The relative representation of the tonic stage of convulsions seemed to be the major determinant of the development of catatonic-cataleptic symptomatology. It is suggested that more than a single neurotransmitter system is involved in the postictal immobility syndrome and each epilepsy model has its unique neurochemical profile."
