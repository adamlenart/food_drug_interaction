    "0": "Although tolerance to midazolam is sometimes described in the palliative care literature, no studies have systemically examined the possibility. To explore the association between midazolam dose for symptom palliation and the administration period, a retrospective study was performed on 62 terminally ill cancer patients who required parenteral midazolam in the final three days of life. The mean maximum dose and administration period of midazolam were 38 +/- 45 mg/day (median = 24) and 10 +/- 19 days (median = 2.5), respectively. Thirteen patients (21%) received midazolam at a dose of 60 mg/day or more, and 13 patients (21%) received it for 14 days or longer. The maximum doses were significantly correlated with patient age (rho = -0.32, P = 0.012) and the administration period (rho = 0.47, P < 0.01); and were significantly higher in patients who received midazolam for 14 days or longer (74 +/- 63 mg/day vs. 28 +/- 34 mg/day, P < 0.01). Multivariate analyses revealed that younger age (< or =70) and longer administration periods (> or =14 days) were independent determinants for a midazolam requirement of 60 mg/day or more (odds ratios [95% C.I.] = 0.091 [0.009 - 0.92], P = 0.042; 11 [2.3 - 54], P < 0.01; respectively). The significant correlation of midazolam doses with administration period suggests that the longer use of midazolam can result in the development of tolerance. This finding suggests that midazolam should be reserved for patients with limited prognoses.", 
    "1": "Myoclonus refers to brief muscle jerks caused by neuronal discharges. Etiologies are numerous, ranging from physiological jerks to myoclonus secondary to severe neurodegenerative conditions. The source of myoclonus may be in the cerebral cortex, the brain stem or the spinal cord and multiple generators may be involved in a single patient. The clinical approach to myoclonus relies on both etiological and physiological classifications. Pharmacological therapy is largely based on the presumed site of origin of myoclonus. Polytherapy may be required, particularly in severe cases of cortical myoclonus.", 
    "2": "Dystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscular contractions with numerous underlying etiologies. This review examines the varied phenomenology of dystonias, its evolving classification including recent genetic data as well as its clinical investigation and treatment. Although age of onset, anatomical distribution and family history are key elements of the investigation of dystonia, classification increasingly relies on etiologic and genetic criteria. Physiological abnormalities in striato-cortical circuits are common in dystonia but the pathophysiology is still unclear. In recent years, a great deal has been learned on the more common primary dystonias such as primary torsion dystonia and on dystonia-plus syndromes such as dopamine responsive dystonia. Treatment of dystonia has also evolved and there are now a number of therapeutic agents with clear beneficial effects including anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and botulinum toxin and there is growing interest in neurofunctional surgery including deep brain stimulation.", 
    "3": "The toxic effects of glutamate in the central nervous system are well known. This neurotoxicity occurs through metabotropic and ionotropic receptors, the latter group composed of N-methyl-D-aspartate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA), and kainate receptors. The authors investigated the neuroprotective effects of GYKI 52466, a 2,3-benzodiazepine that is a selective and potent AMPA receptor antagonist, in a rat spinal cord trauma model.", 
    "4": "Sixty Wistar albino rats were studied in three groups of 20 animals each: sham-operated controls (Group 1); spinal cord-injured rats (Group 2); and spinal cord-injured plus GYKI 52466-treated rats (Group 3). In Groups 2 and 3, spinal cord injury (SCI) was induced at the thoracic level by applying an aneurysm clip to the cord for 1 minute. One minute after the clip was removed, the rats in Group 3 received an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg GYKI 52466. Responses to injury and treatment were evaluated based on biochemical parameters (lipid peroxidation and adenosine 5'-triphosphate [ATP] levels in tissue), and on light and transmission electron microscopy findings in cord tissue collected at different times post-SCI. Five rats from each group underwent assessment of functional recovery at 1, 3, and 5 days after SCI; evaluation was performed using the inclined-plane technique and Tarlov motor grading scale. The mean lipid peroxidation levels in Groups 1 and 2 were 21.73 +/- 4.35 and 35.53 +/- 2.99 nmol/g of wet tissue, respectively. The level in Group 3 was 27.98 +/- 3.93 nmol/g of wet tissue, which was significantly lower than that in Group 2 (p < 0.01). The mean ATP levels in Groups 1 and 2 were 166.21 +/- 25.57 and 41.72 +/- 12.28 nmol/g of wet tissue, respectively. The ATP level in Group 3 was 85.82 +/- 13.92 nmol/g of wet tissue, which was significantly higher than that in Group 2 (p < 0.01). Light microscopic examination of Group 2 tissues showed hemorrhage, necrosis, polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, and vascular thrombi. In contrast, the examination of Group 3 tissues showed limited hemorrhage and no necrosis or vascular thrombi. The most prominent findings in Group 2 were hemorrhage and necrosis, whereas the most prominent findings in Group 3 were focal hemorrhage and leukocyte infiltration. Electron microscopy demonstrated that GYKI 52466 protected the neurons, myelin, axons, and intracellular organelles. The mean inclined-plane angles in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 65 degrees, 40 to 45 degrees, and 55 degrees, respectively. Motor scale results in all groups showed a similar trend.", 
    "5": "The findings in this rat model suggest that GYKI 52466 may provide significant therapeutic protection from secondary damage after acute SCI. This agent may be a viable alternative treatment for SCI.", 
    "6": "The effects of oxytocin (OT) on gastric emptying, gastrointestinal transit, and plasma levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) were studied in female rats. Gastrointestinal motility was assessed in rats 15 min after intragastric instillation of a test meal containing charcoal and Na(2)(51)CrO(4). Gastric emptying was determined by measuring the amount of radiolabeled chromium contained in the small intestine as a percentage of the initial amount received. Gastrointestinal transit was evaluated by calculating the geometric center of distribution of the radiolabeled marker. Blood samples were collected for CCK radioimmunoassay. After administration of OT (0.2-0.8 mg/kg), gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit were inhibited, whereas the plasma concentration of CCK was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Atosiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, effectively attenuated the OT- induced inhibition of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. However, administration of atosiban alone had no effect on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. The selective CCK(1) receptor antagonists, devazepide and lorglumide, effectively attenuated the OT-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. L-365, 260, a selective CCK(2) receptor antagonist, did not alter the OT-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. These results suggest that OT inhibits gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit in female rats via a mechanism involving CCK stimulation and CCK(1) receptor activation.", 
    "7": "Behavioral emergencies are a common and serious problem. However, partly because of the inherent dangers of this situation, there is little research to guide the clinical responses to this challenge. The traditionally accepted treatment for such patients involves the use of a typical antipsychotic and a benzodiazepine. Beside the atypical antipsychotics side-effects profile, the utility of this medications in the emergency setting has been relatively unexplored. The recent availability of rapidly dissolving tablets and intramuscular preparations of some atypical agents has provided useful alternatives in some cases. Not less important is the transition to the continuation and maintenance periods. The increased risk of relapses during the transition from acute treatment is one of the most common reasons for the prolonged use of higher doses of typical antipsychotics during the management of the acute episode, and is also a very important limitating factor to release the patient from the institutional (inpatient) services. Those higher doses expose the patient to potential dangerous side effects like acute dystonia, akathisia, ataxia, ortostatic hypotension and cardiac arhytms. This article proposed an algorithm for the control of agitated patients with different preparations of olanzapine in Latin America, following the recommendations of the Eli Lilly Latin America Advisory Board and an extensive review of the literature and data on file of such company about olanzapine in the control of agitated patients and their transition to the maintenance phase.", 
    "8": "A 6-year-old girl who exhibited nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) as her main clinical seizure is reported. Her seizures involved abnormal eye movement that occurred every 1-2 months associated with a dulling of responsiveness and falling easily due to ataxic gait. During the seizure, her eyelids drooped so that the eyes appeared hooded and she seemed to be drunk. During the episode, she laughed or cried easily with no relation to her surroundings. Ictal EEG continuously showed diffuse high-voltage theta and slow waves with spikes and diffuse spike and waves, and interictal EEG showed spike and waves in the left frontal region. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed focal cortical dysplasia in the left frontal region. These findings suggested that the origin of NCSE is related to the frontal lobe.", 
    "9": "In order to assess the response of plasma biochemical parameters to anaesthesia, 40 New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were assigned to four treatment groups (n = 10): control (1 ml i.v. saline solution), fentanyl-droperidol (FD) (0.4 ml/kg s.c. of 'thalamonal' solution; 2.5 mg/ml droperidol, 0.05 mg/ml fentanyl), ketamine (K) (10 mg/kg i.v.) with either xylazine (X) (3 mg/kg i.v.) or diazepam (D) (2 mg/kg i.v.). Blood samples were obtained from the central ear artery at six time points: before injection, and at 10, 30, 60, 120 min and 24 h after injection of the anaesthetics/saline. Plasma ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, BUN, creatinine, phosphate and potassium levels were measured by the Hitachi 747 autoanalyser. The administration of K-X increased (P < 0.05) plasma ALT (from 11.4 +/- 0.9 to 20.2 +/- 1.7 IU/l, at 10 min), AST (from 10.5 +/- 3.3 to 34 +/- 2.1 IU/l, at 120 min), BUN (from 17.2 +/- 0.9 to 25.8 +/- 1.8 mg/dl, at 60 min) and creatinine concentrations (from 1 +/- 0.1 to 1.6 +/- 0.2 mg/dl, at 10 min). After K-D administration, we observed an increase (P < 0.05) in plasma ALT (from 11.4 +/- 0.9 to 20.2 +/- 1.1 IU/l, at 10 min), AST (from 11.4 +/- 1.6 to 28 +/- 3.7 IU/l, at 10 min), BUN (from 15.8 +/- 0.8 to 30 +/- 1.5 mg/dl, at 10 min) and creatinine levels (from 1 +/- 0.08 to 2.2 +/- 0.2 mg/dl, at 120 min). No significant changes were seen in the FD group. We conclude that K-X and K-D may affect plasma concentration of select serum enzymes and biochemical parameters. These results should be taken into account when blood samples are evaluated in treated rabbits.", 
    "10": "The distribution of some cholecystokinin (CCK) systems in the rat brain is reviewed focusing on mesencephalic dopamine neurones which coexpress CCK and, in particular, on cortico-striatal CCK neurones which probably have glutamate as their co-transmitter. Functional studies based on the effect of several CCK(B) antagonists on phencyclidine-induced motility suggest that CCK is involved in locomotor behaviour causing inhibition in phencyclidine-treated habituated rats. In contrast, in unhabituated rats CCK stimulates exploratory behaviour. These effects may be related to the cortico-striatal CCK/glutamatergic pathway. Moreover, these studies provide evidence for endogenous release of a neuropeptide with behavioural consequences.", 
    "11": "The present study investigated the role of muscarinic receptor subtypes in the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis/nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis alpha of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla in morphine-induced antinociception. The antinociceptive effects of morphine were evoked by systemic administration or microinjection into the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis/nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis alpha. Administration of morphine produced antinociception for hot plate and tail immersion responses to noxious heat stimuli. These effects were antagonized by prior exposure to naloxone and inhibited by mecamylamine pretreatment. Morphine-induced antinociception was significantly inhibited by atropine in a dose-dependent manner. Muscarinic toxin-1 and pirenzepine inhibited morphine-induced antinociception for both the hot plate and tail immersion tests. At a dose of 5 nmol/site, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) also inhibited morphine-induced antinociception, although low doses of this drug did not significantly affect hot plate test response latency when morphine was systemically administered. These results suggest that the antinociceptive effects induced by morphine in part involve the muscarinic M(1) and M(3) receptors of the rat nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis/nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis alpha.", 
    "12": "There is little information on interaction between food and the hypnotic agent quazepam. We therefore studied the effects of food and its time interval on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of quazepam.", 
    "13": "A randomized three-phase crossover study with 2-week intervals was conducted. Nine healthy male volunteers took a single oral 20 mg dose of quazepam under the following conditions: 1) after fasting overnight; 2) 30 min after eating standard meal; or 3) 3 h after eating the same meal. Plasma concentrations of quazepam and its metabolite, 2-oxoquazepam and psychomotor function using the Digit Symbol Substitute Test (DSST), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and Visual Analogue Scale were measured up to 48 h.", 
    "14": "During the food treatments at 30 min and 3 h before dosing, the peak concentrations (Cmax) were 300% (95% CI 260, 340%; P < 0.001) and 250% (95% CI 210, 290%; P < 0.01) of the corresponding value during the fasting phase. For quazepam, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h measured at 30 min and 3 h before dosing was significantly increased, with the food treatments by 2.4-fold (95% CI 2.0; 2.8-fold; P < 0.001) and 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.7; 2.4-fold; P < 0.01), respectively. In response to pharmacokinetic changes, some of the pharmacodynamics (DSST, P < 0.05; SSS, P < 0.05) differed significantly between fasted status and fed status. No difference was found in any pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters between the two food treatment phases.", 
    "15": "A food effect on quazepam absorption is evident and continues at least until 3 h after food intake. The dosing of quazepam after a long period of ordinary fasting might reduce its efficacy because a 3 h interval between the timing of the evening meal and bedtime administration of hypnotics is regarded as normal in daily life.", 
    "16": "Zolpidem is a short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic that is an agonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A type (GABAA) receptor. It has been suggested that it acts selectively on alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA benzodiazepine (BZ1) receptors presenting (contrary to classic benzodiazepines) low or no affinity for other subtypes. Therefore, it has been proposed that it lacks the benzodiazepines-like side-effects, having minimal abuse and dependence potential. Nevertheless, there is a considerable number of zolpidem dependence case reports in the literature. We present eight cases of zolpidem abuse and dependence without criminal record, without history of substance abuse (except for one alcohol abuser), with minor psychiatric disorders, who took zolpidem after physicians prescription in order to deal with their insomnia. However, they became zolpidem abusers not craving its sedative, but its anxiolytic and stimulating action, which helped them to cope with everyday activities. It is possible that, in the high doses that our patients used, zolpidem abandons its selectivity for BZ1 receptors and demonstrates all the actions of classic benzodiazepines. Molecular biology, via possible mutations on GABA receptors, may provide some answers as to why our eight patients (who did not differ much from the thousands of insomniacs who use zolpidem) and other zolpidem abusers, raised the dose progressively, and sought something from the drug other than hypnotic action.", 
    "17": "Both ethanol and benzodiazepines impair psychomotor function. Previous work has suggested that ethanol may have a greater effect on errors while benzodiazepines may cause greater slowing, but this has not been tested in a direct comparison. We assessed the effects of ethanol, at blood concentrations of approximately 80-100 mg/100 ml, compared to two doses of temazepam (20 mg and 30 mg) on psychomotor speed and accuracy and on long-term memory. Sixteen healthy volunteers (eight male, aged 20-25 years) took part in a four-period, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Performance was evaluated using analysis of covariance (critical significance level, p = 0.05) comparing the areas under the response-time curves. Performance on a psychomotor maze showed an almost complete dissociation, with ethanol leading to a substantial and significant increase in errors with little effect on speed, while temazepam slowed performance with no significant change in accuracy. Other tasks showed a similar pattern, but the dissociation was less complete. Handwriting size was substantially increased by ethanol, but not by temazepam. Information processing capacity and long-term memory formation were reduced by a similar amount both for ethanol and 30 mg temazepam. The faster, more error-prone, behaviour on ethanol than with a similarly impairing dose of temazepam has clear implications for the relative potential of the two drugs to contribute to accidents. The results are also important in understanding the differential effects of drugs with different mechanisms of action on human performance.", 
    "18": "Lorazepam has been reported to atypically disrupt visual processing compared to other benzodiazepines (BZs), but it is not known to what extent this effect extends to impairment in other modalities. Our objective was to compare the effects of lorazepam with those of flunitrazepam, a BZ with standard effects, on visual and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) using the same paradigm. The study followed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group-design and involved single oral doses of lorazepam (2.0 mg), flunitrazepam (1.2 mg) and placebo. Thirty-six young, healthy subjects completed a test battery before and after treatment including classic behavioural tests, visual and auditory ERPs. Both drugs led to comparable alterations on behavioural tests and double-dissociations were found, indicating that the doses used were equipotent: lorazepam was more deleterious than flunitrazepam and placebo in fragmented shape identification, while simple reaction times were prolonged for flunitrazepam in comparison to lorazepam and placebo. Effects on P3 latencies were also distinct: alterations in both modalities for flunitrazepam were equivalent and greater than placebo's. In contrast, lorazepam at the frontal and central electrode sites led to greater changes in visual than in auditory latency, and also to longer visual latencies than flunitrazepam and placebo, but lorazepam's auditory latency effects were only different to placebo's at the parietal electrode site. Peripheral visual changes were not responsible for these effects. Differences in the impairment profile between equipotent doses of lorazepam and flunitrazepam suggests that lorazepam induces atypical central visual processing changes.", 
    "19": "It is well-documented that benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotics produce robust dose-dependent memory-impairing effects. However, benzodiazepines also induce marked sedation, as reflected in changes in observer and subjective ratings of arousal and impaired psychomotor performance. Thus, it is possible that the observed amnestic effects are secondary to more global sedative effects, and do not reflect a specific, primary, benzodiazepine effect on memory mechanisms. This study was designed to use the non-specific stimulant d-amphetamine to dissociate the sedative and memory-impairing effects of the benzodiazepine triazolam. Across four sessions, 20 healthy adult volunteers received via oral capsule administration placebo, 0.25 mg/70 kg triazolam alone, 20 mg/70 kg d-amphetamine sulfate alone, and triazolam (0.25 mg/ 70 kg) and d-amphetamine (20 mg/70 kg) conjointly, in a double-blind, staggered dosing, cross-over design. d-Amphetamine significantly reversed the effects of triazolam on all participant rating and psychomotor performance-based measures of sedative effects, and selectively reversed the memory-impairing effects of triazolam on some measures (e.g. working memory assessed by a 2-back task, episodic memory assessed by free recall, metamemory), but not others (e.g. working memory assessed by a digit recall task, episodic memory assessed by recognition memory). Results suggest that benzodiazepines do have specific effects on memory that are not merely a by-product of the drugs' sedative effects, and that the degree to which sedative effects contribute to the amnestic effects may vary as a function of the particular memory process being assessed. In addition to enhancing the understanding of the mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine-induced amnesia, these results may also contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between specific memory processes and level of arousal.", 
    "20": "Over the last decade, a large number of studies have characterized stimulus-evoked oscillations in the visual cortex of anesthetized and unanesthetized animals. Comparatively, only a few studies have been performed in auditory cortex. This study compared the tone-evoked oscillations detected from the same recording sites in the thalamo-cortical auditory system of unanesthetized and anesthetized rats. Simultaneous multiunit recordings were collected in auditory cortex, auditory thalamus, and the auditory sector of the reticular nucleus of restrained rats, which spontaneously shifted from waking (W) to slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS). Subsequently, the same recording sites were tested under pentobarbital anesthesia, then under high doses of diazepam, and finally under urethan anesthesia. Under these drugs, oscillations were detected in 54% of the recordings: one-half of them were stimulus-locked oscillations and were directly observed on peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs); one-half of them were non-stimulus-locked oscillations and were detected on autocorrelograms. Spontaneous oscillations were present for 17% of the recordings. During SWS, only non-stimulus-locked oscillations were observed for a small percentage of recordings (12%). This percentage did not differ significantly from the one of spontaneous oscillations obtained during SWS (8%). No oscillations were found in W and PS. Both under anesthesia and in SWS, the frequency range of the oscillations was 5-15 Hz, and there was no frequency difference between evoked and spontaneous oscillations. Although surprising, the absence of oscillations in awake animals may allow each neuron to process acoustic information independently of its neighbors and may in fact benefit auditory perception.", 
    "21": "Elderly patients with depression commonly suffer from concurrent symptoms of anxiety or comorbid anxiety disorders. Such comorbidity is associated with a more severe presentation of depressive illness, including greater suicidality. Additionally, most antidepressant treatment studies of elderly individuals with depression have found poorer treatment outcomes in those with comorbid anxiety, for example, delayed or diminished response and increased likelihood of dropout from treatment. In terms of treatment of anxious depression, there is evidence that tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not different from each other in terms of efficacy or tolerability. Rather than the specific choice of antidepressant medication, it appears that quality of clinical management has the greatest impact on likelihood of remission in anxious depressed elderly individuals. Co-prescription of benzodiazepines is sometimes warranted for severe anxiety, but increases the risk of cognitive or motor impairment. Psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, which are efficacious for late-life depression in general, should also be considered for treatment alone or in combination with appropriate medication. Future research areas are also addressed in this paper.", 
    "22": "The consequences of the neurotoxic insult induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, an amphetamine derivative with specific action on the serotonergic system) were compared with those of methamphetamine (a derivative with specific action on dopaminergic system) in rats. Both drugs induced a very similar loss of body weight, especially evident 24 h after treatment. Their hyperthermic profile was also very similar and was dependent on ambient temperature, corroborating the thermo-dysregulatory effect of both substances. Methamphetamine (four injections of 10 mg kg(-1) s.c. at 2-h intervals) induced the loss of dopaminergic (35%) but not of serotonergic, terminals in the rat striatum and, simultaneously, a significant increase in striatal peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor density, pointing to a glial reaction. Evidence for this drug-induced astrogliosis was the increased heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) expression in striatum, cortex and hippocampus. MDMA (20 mg kg(-1) s.c. b.i.d. for 4 days) induced a similar dopaminergic lesion in the striatum 3 days post-treatment, which reversed 4 days later. An important neurotoxic effect on serotonergic terminals was also observed in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus 3 days post-treatment, which partially reversed 4 days later in the striatum and hippocampus. No microglial activation was noticeable at either 3 or 7 days after MDMA treatment. This lack of effect on microglial cells was assessed by [(3)H]PK 11195 binding and OX-6 immunostaining, which were unchanged in the striatum and cortex after MDMA treatment. A non-significant tendency to increase was noted in the hippocampus 3 days after MDMA treatment. Furthermore, in MDMA-treated rats, neither HSP27 expression nor an increase in HSP27 immunoreactivity were detected. This result, together with the lack of increase in glial fibrilliary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity, indicate no astroglial activation at either 3 or 7 days post-treatment. Without microglial activation, an inflammatory process would not accompany the lesion induced by MDMA. The differences in glial activation between methamphetamine and MDMA observed in the present study could have implications for the prognosis of the injury induced by these drugs.", 
    "23": "How glutamate regulates dopamine (DA) release in striatum has been a controversial issue. Here, we resolve this by showing that glutamate, acting at AMPA receptors, inhibits DA release by a nonclassic mechanism mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Moreover, we show that GABA(A)-receptor activation opposes this process, thereby enhancing DA release. The influence of glutamate and GABA on DA release was assessed in striatal slices using carbon-fiber microelectrodes and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Modulation by both transmitters was prevented by H(2)O(2)-metabolizing enzymes. In addition, the influence of GABA(A)-receptor activation was lost when AMPA receptors were blocked with GYKI-52466. Together, these data show that modulation of DA release by glutamate and GABA depends on H(2)O(2) generated downstream from AMPA receptors. This is the first evidence that endogenous glutamate can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species under physiological conditions. We also show that inhibition of DA release by H(2)O(2) is mediated by sulfonylurea-sensitive K(+) channels: tolbutamide blocked DA modulation by glutamate and by GABA. The absence of ionotropic glutamate or GABA receptors on DA terminals indicates that modulatory H(2)O(2) is generated in non-DA cells. Thus, in addition to its known excitatory actions in striatum, glutamate mediates inhibition by generating H(2)O(2) that must diffuse from postsynaptic sites to inhibit presynaptic DA release via K(+)-channel opening. These findings have significant implications not only for normal striatal function but also for understanding disease states that involve DA and oxidative stress, including disorders as diverse as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.", 
    "24": "Status epilepticus is a neurologic emergency associated with high mortality and long-term disability. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the initiation and perpetuation of seizure activity have revealed that status epilepticus is a dynamic and evolving process. Alterations at the cellular level parallel physiological, physical, and electrical changes at the bedside. Loss of cerebral autoregulation and neuronal damage begin after 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity. This understanding has led to changes in treatments of status epilepticus, which must be multidisciplinary and occur simultaneously in many different areas. The goals of pharmacological therapy are to terminate seizures early and prevent recurrence. Two recent large clinical studies have shown the benefit of early administration of benzodiazepines to control status epilepticus. Pharmacological algorithms designed to focus medical management have trended toward earlier and more aggressive treatment. The hope is that continued exploration into the basic mechanisms involved in status epilepticus and future controlled clinical trials defining optimal medical management will produce further advances.", 
    "25": "Diazepine analogs of thieno[2,3-b]pyrrolizin-8-ones were synthesized by aromatization of 2-hydroxypyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e][1,4]diazepines. These compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antiproliferative activity against the L1210 leukemia cell line. The activity of these compounds was in the micromolar range, the best result being for the mixture of the isomers 5 and 6 which showed a 0.35 microM IC50 against cell growth.", 
    "26": "The concentration of fenazepam in the blood plasma of rats upon application of the transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) fenapercuten was very low, incomparable to the drug concentration (recalculated to equal input doses) upon intravenous or enteral administration. Nevertheless, the TTS exhibited a pronounced anxiolytic and weak sedative action in the absence of any side myorelaxant effect. The agent responsible for adverse side effects (3-hydroxyfenazepam) was not determined in the blood plasma upon the TTS application. A steady-state concentration of fenazepam in the blood plasma of rats was observed between 2nd and 8th hours upon fenapercuten application, which agrees with the duration of anxiolytic action of the parent drug.", 
    "27": "This article deals with the problem of model selection for the mathematical description of tracer kinetics in nuclear medicine. It stems from the consideration of some specific data sets where different models have similar performances. In these situations, it is shown that considerate averaging of a parameter's estimates over the entire model set is better than obtaining the estimates from one model only. Furthermore, it is also shown that the procedure of averaging over a small number of \"good\" models reduces the \"generalization error,\" the error introduced when the model selected over a particular data set is applied to different conditions, such as subject populations with altered physiologic parameters, modified acquisition protocols, and different signal-to-noise ratios. The method of averaging over the entire model set uses Akaike coefficients as measures of an individual model's likelihood. To facilitate the understanding of these statistical tools, the authors provide an introduction to model selection criteria and a short technical treatment of Akaike's information-theoretic approach. The new method is illustrated and epitomized by a case example on the modeling of [11C]flumazenil kinetics in the brain, containing both real and simulated data.", 
    "28": "Metabolic precursors and prodrugs of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), including 1,4-butanediol (BDL) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), have sedative and anesthetic effects and might have positive reinforcing effects. BDL and GBL were evaluated using behavioral procedures that measure positive reinforcing effects and discriminative stimulus effects of drugs that modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA(A) receptor complex. One group of rhesus monkeys could respond for saline or the barbiturate methohexital (i.v.) in a self-administration paradigm. Two other groups of monkeys discriminated the barbiturate pentobarbital (i.g.) or the benzodiazepine midazolam (s.c.) from saline in a drug discrimination paradigm; another group of monkeys was treated with the benzodiazepine diazepam (5.6 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and discriminated the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (s.c.) from vehicle. In self-administration experiments, methohexital and not BDL (0.1-3.2 mg/kg/injection) or GBL (0.1-3.2 mg/kg/injection) reliably maintained responding above saline levels. BDL and GBL, up to doses that suppressed responding, did not substitute for pentobarbital, midazolam or flumazenil. The onset of action for both drugs to decrease response rate was delayed (90 min for GBL and 150 min for BDL). These results suggest that any abuse-related effects of BDL and GBL are qualitatively different from the abuse-related effects of GABA(A) receptor modulators and further indicate that BDL and GBL do not have positive reinforcing effects in rhesus monkeys experienced with self-administration of a short-acting sedative-hypnotic.", 
    "29": "The biological activity of many low molecular weight antitumor compounds appear to be related to their mode and specificity of interaction with particular DNA sequences. Such small molecules are of considerable interest in chemistry, biology and medicine. Most of the anticancer drugs employed clinically exert their antitumor effect by inhibiting nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) or protein synthesis. Inhibition can occur for example through cross-linking of bases in DNA or binding to and inactivation of enzymes necessary for the synthetic processes. It is evident that DNA is an important cellular target for many anticancer agents. Much information has been obtained from molecular genetics, i.e. replication of DNA and its transcription to RNA, which provides the template for protein synthesis. DNA is a well-characterized intracellular target but its large size and sequential nature makes it an elusive target for selective drug action. Binding of low molecular weight ligands to DNA causes a wide variety of potential biological responses. In this context PBDs (pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines), a group of potent naturally occurring antitumor antibiotics produced by various Streptomyces species, are one of the most promising types of lead compounds. They differ in the number, type and position of substituent in both their aromatic A-ring and Py C-rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C-rings which can be either fully saturated or unsaturated at either C2-C3 (endocyclic) or C2 (exocyclic). There is either an imine or carbinolamine methyl ether at the N10-C11 position. This latter is an electrophilic center responsible for alkylating DNA. In the search for compounds with better antitumor selectivity and DNA sequence specificity many PBD analogues have been synthesized in an attempt to increase their potency against tumor cells. We review here recent progress on pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBDs) analogues and their conjugates, also the progress and developments of PBD conjugates with polyamides (information reading molecules in the minor groove of DNA). For example, the cross-linking efficiency of PBD dimers is much greater than that of other cross linkers including cisplatin and melphalan. A large number of PBD dimers and polyamide conjugates with varying linker lengths and bearing different heterocycles at different positions in the PBD ring synthesized in our group and their pharmacological properties have been reviewed.", 
    "30": "Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) are naturally occurring compounds isolated from various Streptomyces species. The PBDs exert their biological activity through covalent binding and exhibit cytotoxicity. Extensive studies have been carried out on the synthetic strategies of PBDs, and a sound understanding of structure activity relationships within this class of compounds has been developed. The PBDs have shown to interfere with the interaction of endonuclease enzymes of DNA and block the transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase in a sequence specific manner. These processes have been thought to account for the biological activity of PBDs. The PBDs have also been used as a scaffold to attach different type of moieties leading to novel sequence selective DNA cleaving and cross-linking agents. The design and synthesis of C8-linked PBD dimers and other hybrids of PBDs has given a new insight towards the development of molecules with enhanced DNA binding affinity and sequence specificity compared to the naturally occurring PBDs. This improvement in the biological profile has been explained on the basis of certain factors like DNA cross-linking and doubling of DNA binding sites. There seems to be enough potential for further changing the substitution pattern and to design structurally modified PBDs by retaining the PBD core intact. In this review both the synthetic strategies and the structure-activity relationships, particularly the DNA binding and cytotoxicity studies of PBDs have been discussed.",

    "32": "The experiment was performed on eight anaesthetized pigs during control conditions and after administration of the CCK-A and m3 receptor antagonists, Tarazepide and 4-DAMP, respectively. Catheters were surgically implanted in the pancreatic duct for juice collection and in the gastric and right gastro-epipoic arteries and in the jugular vein, so that infusions of CCK-33 could be made exclusively to the duodenum/stomach, duodenum/pancreas or general circulation, respectively.", 
    "33": "Infusion of a low dose of CCK-33 (13 pmol kg(-1)) to the general circulation did not affect pancreatic protein or trypsin output. When the same dose was given directly to the duodenum/stomach or the duodenum/pancreas, pancreatic output increased during both control conditions and after Tarazepide and/or 4-DAMP treatment, though the increase in trypsin output was lower after Tarazepide and/or 4-DAMP blockade. A high dose of CCK-33 (130 pmol kg(-1)) given peripherally stimulated the pancreatic secretion, but this response was totally abolished in Tarazepide and 4-Damp treated animals.", 
    "34": "Pancreatic enzyme secretion due to CCK-33 stimulation depends on the presence of short duodenal-pancreatic peptidergic reflexes evoked mainly via low sensitive, probably CCK-B, receptors located in the duodenum/stomach. Pancreatic secretion evoked by peripheral CCK-33 in pharmacological doses was independent of m3 receptors blockade but depended on CCK-A receptors located elsewhere than in the duodenum/pancreas.", 
    "35": "Few clinical studies have assessed gamma-hydroxybutyrate and chlorprothixene/phenobarbital sedation in children. This prospective trial compared the two regimes in children, in particular concerning differences in recovery time.", 
    "36": "28 pediatric oncology patients undergoing elective MRI studies at a university hospital were randomly assigned to either receive gamma-hydroxybutyrate or chlorprothixene/phenobarbital sedation. Time to induce deep sedation (Ramsay score of 5) and recovery time, the incidence of failure of sedation, the frequency of side effects, the need for therapeutic interventions, and the number of patients receiving additional midazolam were recorded. Analysis of hemodynamic parameters was performed at five defined time points.", 
    "37": "All 28 MRI studies were successfully completed. Recovery time was significantly shorter with gamma-hydroxybutyrate (p < 0.01). There were more side effects with chlorprothixene/phenobarbital, in particular tachycardia and hyperexcitation. Vomiting was the side effect most often seen in gamma-hydroxybutyrate sedation. Therapeutic interventions were not required in any patient. Additional midazolam was necessary to maintain satisfactory sedation in six children receiving gamma-hydroxybutyrate and four receiving chlorprothixene/phenobarbital.", 
    "38": "Due to its significantly shorter recovery time, gamma-hydroxybutyrate is a reasonable sedative drug for children undergoing non-invasive diagnostic procedures, and is superior to chlorprothixene/phenobarbital. In pediatric oncology patients gamma-hydroxybutyrate appears to be associated more often with vomiting. The long recovery time and its great variability make chlorprothixene/phenobarbital a less valuable alternative.", 
    "39": "Biologic data related to pancreatic regeneration and acinar-cell homeostasis after ductal decompression would be useful in clinical settings to elucidate the time at which obstructions in human biliary acute pancreatitis (AP) should be removed. Our aim was to evaluate the outcome of AP after early removal of bile-pancreatic-duct obstruction (BPDO) and to ascertain whether cholecystokinin (CCK) blockade accelerates recovery from the disease. We conducted analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle, as well as measurements of enzyme and calcium load, in acinar cells using flow cytometry to ascertain the capability of the pancreas to regain its function after AP. Male Wistar rats were subjected to AP by means of BPDO for 6 hours and 24 hours. In other groups, the BPDO was opened 24 hours after induction; 3 days and 7 days later they were killed. Half of the rats in which the BPDO was opened were administered L364,718, a CCK-receptor antagonist (0.1 mg/kg/12 hours), 30 minutes before the induction of BPDO. Plasma amylase activity, hematocrit, and pancreatic weight returned to control values after BPDO opening. The highest degree of oxidative stress was found in the pancreases of rats subjected to BPDO for 6 hours, as indicated by the decrease in pancreatic glutathione content, but it was not restored 7 days after BPDO opening. Cell-cycle distribution, as measured with propidium iodide DNA staining, showed increases in the proportion of acinar cells in S-phase from 3 days after BPDO opening in L364,718-treated and nontreated rats. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling revealed deletion of acinar cells by way of apoptosis 3 days after BPDO opening. However, it may be compensated 7 days after BPDO opening because regardless of whether rats were treated with L364,718, significant increases in synthesis and mitosis were detected. Accumulation of digestive enzymes and calcium in acinar cells was found during BPDO, but this appeared to have normalized 3 days after BPDO opening and onward in both L364,718-treated and nontreated rats. In conclusion, early removal of obstruction allowed rapid cell proliferation and prevented the progression of severe alterations within acinar cells induced by BPDO. CCK blockade does not accelerate pancreatic recovery after BPDO opening.", 
    "40": "Sensory or P50 gating, as measured with the double click paradigm, reflects a slow inhibitory preattentional information process. It protects living organisms from being flooded by environmental stimuli. The effects of a single dose of diazepam (10 mg) on the amplitude of the P50's and P50 gating, as measured from auditory evoked potentials elicited by double clicks (80 dB white noise, interstimulus interval 500 ms) were investigated in a double blind, placebo controlled study in healthy volunteers. P50 gating was found, however diazepam had no effects on the amplitude of the P50, nor on P50 gating. The results contribute to the specificity of psychoactive drugs to control gating and demonstrate that this slow inhibitory process is not effected by this benzodiazepine. Moreover, the results confirm that P50 and P50 gating are indeed preattentive processes that are not controlled by diazepam.", 
    "41": "Corticosterone response to separation stress and its sensitivity to the anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), were examined in 7-day-old domestic fowl (Gallus gallus). Saline or CDP (8.0 mg/kg) was injected intramuscularly 30 min before tests. Chicks were placed in isolation either with or without mirrors for a 15-min observation period, in which distress vocalizations were recorded. After testing, chicks were euthanized and blood was collected for the corticosterone assay. Chicks tested in the No-Mirror condition displayed an increase in vocalizations that was attenuated by CDP. Similarly, corticosterone levels were highest in chicks tested in the No-Mirror condition; however, CDP only modestly attenuated corticosterone levels. The present findings demonstrate that corticosterone levels parallel the behavioral marker of distress vocalizations in this paradigm, but this biological marker may be less sensitive than the behavioral marker to benzodiazepine anxiolytic manipulations.",

Alprazolam was given at a dosage of 0.02 mg/kg (0.009 mg/lb), PO, as needed 1 hour before anticipated storms and every 4 hours as needed. Desensitization and counter-conditioning were conducted at home by the caregiver with an audio simulation of storm sounds that had induced a fear response during evaluation.", 
    "46": "30 of the 32 dogs that completed the study had a degree of improvement, as measured by caregivers' global assessment. Two caregivers considered the storm phobia to be resolved. Panting, pacing, trembling, remaining near the caregiver, hiding, excessive salivation, destructiveness, excessive vocalization, self-trauma, and inappropriate elimination all decreased significantly during treatment. Improvement was greater during true storms (rain, thunder, and lightning) than during rain only. Response to audio simulation did not change during treatment. Four months after the study, improvement was maintained.",

    "48": "The effect of anticholinergic drugs on gastrointestinal motility is complex and incompletely recognized. Accordingly, in 6 adult sheep bipolar electrodes and strain gage force transducers were surgically attached to the antral, small intestinal and gallbladder wall at the serosal side. During chronic experiments the myoelectric and mechanical recordings were performed in fasted and non-fasted animals before and after various doses of hexamethonium, atropine and pirenzepine given intravenously. Hexamethonium administration triggered rebound excitation after an inhibitory period almost in all the recording sites. Administration of atropine and pirenzepine evoked these secondary contractions mostly in the small intestine and gallbladder. No rebounds were observed when the anticholinergic drugs were given during feeding. In fasted animals, rebound excitation arrived later but more frequently than in non-fasted animals. The excitatory changes were dose-dependent. In the gallbladder, these values were lower than in the small intestine. The frequency of the recurrent pattern was dependent upon the dose of the anticholinergic drug used. It is concluded that nicotinic receptors are more important than muscarinic receptors in the initiation of the rebound excitation in pyloric antrum while in the small bowel and gallbladder the role of both cholinergic receptors is similar. The anticholinergic drugs should be used with caution in all these clinical situations, where the enhancement of gastrointestinal motility must be avoided.", 
    "49": "Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) was found useful for differentiating fear and anxiety in rats. These affective states were established through a Pavlovian conditioning procedure. Danger stimulus, preceding unavoidable tail shock, elicited acute fear. Intertrial situational cues evoked anxiety. A safety signal (SS) indicating the omission of shock inhibited fear. Sustained 22-kHz USV characterized anxiety and was present between trials. A signal of danger resulted in immediate inhibition of vocalization, while a SS reversed this effect. These results are discussed in the context of three theories: Pavlovian, Bollesian and Konorskian. The anxiolytic drugs diazepam and buspirone (1 and 5 mg/kg) suppressed vocalization in the intertrial and SS periods. The reaction to the signal of danger remained complete inhibition of USV. Anxiogenic pentyletetrazole (1 and 5 mg/kg) enhanced intertrial vocalization, but did not affect its reoccurrence during the SS. Anxiogenic FG7142 (5 mg/kg) did not affect intertrial vocalization, but blocked its reappearance on the SS. It is suggested that the behavioral target of both anxiogenic drugs is different-pentyletetrazole supposedly exerts its anxiogenic effect by increasing situational anxiety, whereas FG7142 suppresses inhibition of fear.", 
    "50": "Angelman syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with cognitive impairment and neurological deficits. It results from a maternal deletion of human chromosome 15q11-13 containing two candidate genes E6-P ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) and GABA(A) receptor beta3 subunit (GABRB3), the latter of which has been also linked to autism. To clarify the potential role of GABA(A) beta3 subunit-containing inhibitory receptors in these disorders, we applied ligand autoradiography on brain sections from mice with inactivated GABRB3 or maternal UBE3A genes. Binding of GABA(A) receptor channel ([(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate) and benzodiazepine ([(3)H]Ro 15-4513) site ligands was reduced in selected brain regions of the beta3-deficient mice as compared to controls, while the UBE3A-deficient mice failed to show reduced GABA(A) receptors. The results, suggesting two different pathophysiological mechanisms, are in agreement with positron emission tomography results from Angelman syndrome patients of the corresponding genetic backgrounds.", 
    "51": "The antinociceptive and anti-edematogenic effects of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands, Ro5-4864 (7-chloro-5- (4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2) and PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide), were studied in an experimental model of carrageenan/LPS -induced arthritis in rats. These effects were compared with those of indomethacin and dexamethasone. Both pre and post-treatments with PK11195 were found to be anti-edematogenic and antinociceptive. The lower dose (0.01 mg/kg) exhibited the higher anti-edematogenic effect. On the other hand, the higher dose (0.5 mg/kg) produced antinociception, but with a decreased anti-edematogenic effect. Ro5-4864 produced a negligible antinociception and anti-edematogenic effect as pretreatment, but a pro-edematogenic effect when given as post-treatment. Dexamethasone and indomethacin presented parallel and dose-dependent antinociceptive and anti-edematogenic effects. In conclusion, PK11195 can effectively diminish arthritic nociception and edema elicited by LPS, but probably by mechanisms different from those of dexamethasone or indomethacin. RO5-4864 seemed to have opposite effect on this model.", 
    "52": "Aggression is a common behavioral symptom of dementia. Aggression is associated with frontotemporal dementia, greater dementia severity, cognitive decline, and other behavioral and psychological disturbances. It is influenced by the environment and has been correlated with neuropathologic changes and certain polymorphisms. Aggression in dementia patients results in higher psychotropic use and distress to family caregivers and nursing home staff; it is predictive of institutionalization. There is empirical evidence for the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and more limited evidence for psychosocial interventions in the successful management of aggression in persons with dementia. Management of aggression should include comprehensive assessment of medical, psychological, and environmental variables.", 
    "53": "Reports indicate that the severely mentally ill, those patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, are at increased risk of being violent to others. They are also at increased risk of being victims of violence or homicide. This article discusses the state of knowledge concerning the 3 most common classes of drugs used to decrease agitation in the psychiatric emergency service setting: benzodiazepines, conventional antipsychotics, and atypical antipsychotics. The decision whether to use benzodiazepines alone versus benzodiazepines combined with an antipsychotic, and whether that antipsychotic should be a conventional or atypical antipsychotic, hinges on considerations of mental health history, need for synergistic sedating effects, and the side effect profiles of the various medications.", 
    "54": "Agitation is a common and difficult problem in psychiatric patients; patients with bipolar disorder constitute a substantial proportion of the agitated psychiatric population. Agitation is often seen in bipolar patients during acute manic states, when increased energy levels and reduced need for sleep lead patients to collide with the limits of others. Agitation also occurs during mixed and depressive states, which are characterized by fluctuating energy levels and periods of irritability. Although the prevalence of agitation is similar in men and women, its presentation often differs between the sexes. In addition, the presentations of bipolar disorder in children and in geriatric patients, and thus the manifestations of illness-related agitation, differ both from each other and from that of younger adults. Intensive treatment is required to manage agitated bipolar patients in a manner that rapidly decreases their suffering and maintains their safety and the safety of those around them. Considerations of speed and predictability tend to drive decisions in this setting more than concerns about tolerability. Oral or parenteral benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with an antipsychotic, are recommended as first-line treatment for the termination of behavioral emergencies in mania. Once behavioral control is restored, evidence suggests the combination of orally loaded divalproex sodium with an atypical antipsychotic is associated with more rapid improvement. Medication treatment of children and of geriatric patients must take into account developmental influences on the presentation of bipolar disorder in these different patient groups.", 
    "55": "Piper methysticum extract (Kava kava) possesses anxiolytic properties. However, it is unknown whether these effects are best predicted by total kavalactone content or by one or more of its primary kavalactone constituents. Using the chick social separation-stress procedure as an anxiolytic bioassay, P. methysticum samples containing 12.8-100.0% total kavalactones (Exp. 1) and fractions containing 1-6 kavalactones of varying concentrations (0.1-67.5%; Exps. 2-3) were screened for activity and compared against a 5.0 mg/kg dose of chlordiazepoxide (CDP; Exp. 3). Eight-day-old chicks received IP injections of either vehicle or test compounds 30 min before being placed in the presence of two conspecifics or in isolation for a 3 min observation period. Dependent measures were ventral recumbency latency (sedation), distress vocalizations, and a measure of stress-induced analgesia (in Exps. 1 and 2 only). P. methysticum extract samples attenuated distress vocalizations in a concentration-dependent manner. The P. methysticum fraction that contained the highest concentration of dihydrokavain attenuated distress vocalizations in a manner equivalent to that of CDP. The extract samples and fractions that possessed anxiolytic properties did not possess the sedative properties found in CDP. Collectively, these findings suggest that dihydrokavain may be necessary and sufficient in mediating the anxiolytic properties of P. methysticum extract.", 
    "56": "Traditionally, the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been managed with neuroleptics or benzodiazepines, which have serious side effects. Preliminary observations suggest the possible value of cholinesterase inhibitors in the amelioration of psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, dementia with Lewy bodies, and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Twelve inpatients with AD with psychotic symptoms and lack of improvement of their delusions/hallucinations during perphenazine treatment (8 mg/day) for 3 weeks received random open-label donepezil 5 mg daily in addition to an ongoing treatment of 8 mg/day perphenazine or 16 mg/day perphenazine. Assessments conducted at baseline and after weeks 2 and 4 included the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Global Deterioration Scale, the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions scale. Frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms was measured according to the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. The donepezil-perphenazine group exhibited substantially greater and clinical improvements in mental state. At the end of the trial (4 weeks), Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale scores revealed significant differences between both groups (p = 0.006). The Clinical Global Impressions scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination scores also showed significant differences between the donepezil-perphenazine group and the perphenazine group (p = 0.028 and p = 0.027 respectively). No significant differences were found in the Global Deterioration Scale scores. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores showed a significant deterioration in extrapyramidal symptoms in the perphenazine group compared with the donepezil-perphenazine group (p = 0.016). Donepezil augmentation of neuroleptics may be appropriate for those patients for whom neuroleptic monotherapy either does not lead to symptom remission or is associated with intolerable adverse effects. This was an open-label study and there is need for larger studies with double-blind control and a long-term study design to define the efficacy of donepezil for patients with AD and psychotic symptoms.", 
    "57": "To date there is no common or adequate therapeutic strategy for treatment of refractory schizophrenic patients. Increasing antipsychotics' doses in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients is the most common intervention used by clinicians. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic, which in a number of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies has been found to be more effective than haloperidol for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. During the last few years there have been several reports of successful results in prescribing olanzapine at dosages of more than 25 mg/day for treatment-resistant schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. This report presents the results from the treatment of three resistant schizophrenic patients treated successfully with high dosages of olanzapine (35, 40, and 60 mg/day). None of the patients had any side effects, including abnormal laboratory levels and weight gain. The results and literature data suggest that in clinical practice some schizophrenic patients resistant to conventional neuroleptic treatment and not responding to olanzapine at recommended dosages as high as 20 mg/day may respond to higher dosages such as 40 or 60 mg/day, and these dosages are well tolerated. Further prospective clinical studies are needed.", 
    "58": "The 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4 methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) and its analogues represent a family of selective AMPA antagonists. They modulate AMPA channel functions through an allosteric site on the receptor, which is probably different from the ones involved in the actions of cyclothiazide and aniracetam. These compounds are frequently used as research tools to elucidate glutamate receptor-mediated functions. The most effective members of the family inhibit AMPA-induced currents in the submicromolar range. In addition, they are active at low systemic doses in various in vivo experimental models and also possess a good oral bioavailability. In vitro and in vivo pharmacological results with 2,3-benzodiazepine AMPA antagonists indicate their potential therapeutical value in treating a great variety of central nervous system diseases, of which epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders are regarded as the most important.",

The mean (+/-SD) dosages of midazolam used in RSI were 2.6 (+/-1.7) mg in children (age < or = 18) and 3.7 (+/-2.5) mg in adults (age > or =19); the mean (+/-SD) dosages by weight were 0.08 (+/-0.04) mg/kg in children and 0.05 (+/-0.03) mg/kg in adults. More than half (56%) of the children, and nearly all (92%) of the adults, received dosages lower than the minimum recommended dosage (0.1 mg/kg). Of patients who received barbiturates, only 21% of children and 21% of adults received a dose lower than the minimum recommended. When combined with another induction agent, midazolam was dosed similarly to when it was used alone: mean adult doses were 3.1 (+/-1.2) mg and 0.04 (+/-0.02) mg/kg.",

    "63": "Significant variability in the effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor ligands on emotional reactivity in animals and humans suggests that the endocannabinoid system may selectively modulate certain types of anxiety. In view of substantial evidence for qualitative differences in the nature of anxiety elicited on initial and subsequent exposures to the elevated plus-maze, the present studies contrasted the behavioural effects of the selective CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) and the reference benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 15 mg/kg) both in maze-naive mice (trial 1) and in mice that had been given a single undrugged exposure to the maze 24 h prior to testing (trial 2). Results confirmed the anxioselective effect of CDP on trial 1 but a complete absence of such activity on trial 2 (i.e. one trial tolerance). In marked contrast, SR141716A had no behavioural effects in maze-naive mice but, at doses of 1.0-3.0 mg/kg (effect maximal at 1.0 mg/kg), significantly reduced anxiety-like responses in maze-experienced animals. Like the effect of CDP on trial 1, the antianxiety profile of SR141716A on plus-maze trial 2 was observed in the absence of any change in general activity levels. The apparent experientially induced 'sensitization' to the anxiolytic-like effects of SR141716A in the plus-maze contrasts markedly with the widely reported loss of benzodiazepine efficacy in test-experienced animals. Data are discussed in relation to the recently described phenotypes of CB1 receptor knockout mice and, in particular, to mounting evidence for the existence of a novel SR141716A-sensitive neuronal cannabinoid receptor.", 
    "64": "An original high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) procedure was developed for the determination of sildenafil in biological fluids. Liquid-liquid extraction was performed by chloroform/2-propanol/n-heptane (25:10:65, v/v) at pH 9.5 with 300 ng of buprenorphine-d4 as the internal standard (IS). After agitation (10 min) and centrifugation (3500 x g, 10 min), the organic phase was evaporated and the dry extract resuspended in 25 microL methanol, from which 2 microL was injected onto a NovaPak C18 (Waters) HPLC column. Separation was carried out by a gradient of (acetonitrile + 10 microg/mL trimethylamine) in 2mM NH4COOH pH 3.0 buffer (35-70% in 9 min). Detection was done by a PerkinElmer Sciex API-100 single-quadrupole mass analyzer with an ionspray interface operated in positive-ion mode. MS data were collected as either TIC or SIM at m/z (475 + 534) or (475 + 283) for sildenafil, depending on the potential applied at the ion sampling orifice (0 V or + 100 V). The retention times of sildenafil and the IS were 4.20 and 5.07 min, respectively. Extraction recoveries were always > 87%. LOD and LOQ were 0.2 and 0.5 ng/mL whatever the biological fluid tested. The method appears specific, extremely sensitive, and relatively simple in both equipment and sample preparation. As an example, we present the results of a preliminary study on the salivary excretion of sildenafil following the oral intake (T0) of 25 mg Viagra in a 38-year-old volunteer. Sildenafil was detectable in oral fluid at T0 + 0.5 h (1.2 ng/mL) and peaked at T0 + 1.5 h (8.3 ng/mL), whereas at the same time its plasma concentration was 72.4 ng/mL. Salivary concentrations then rapidly decreased, and the last detectable value (0.9 ng/mL) was at T0 + 5.5 h. It is suggested that the salivary excretion pattern of sildenafil resembles that of benzodiazepines (high plasma protein binding, low saliva-to-plasma ratio).", 
    "65": "An oxycodone postmortem database was created from 1243 solicited cases from Medical Examiner and Coroner (ME/C) offices in 23 states in the United States over the period from August 27, 1999, through January 17, 2002. The request for cases was specific to only those cases in which the ME/C opined that the death involved oxycodone. Each case was evaluated to determine the role of oxycodone and the specific drug product OxyContin tablets in the death. Oxycodone identification was based on toxicology testing, and OxyContin identification was based on evidence found at the scene, credible witness reports, or identification of tablets in gastrointestinal contents. A system of case categorization was developed for this study based on the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) system for reporting drug abuse mortality data in the United States, using the same standardized, well-understood terminology. Of the 1243 cases, 79 cases were incomplete and could not be evaluated. There were an additional 150 cases submitted in which oxycodone was not identified by the originating ME/C. Of the remaining 1014 cases, 919 (90.6%) were related to drug abuse, whereas 95 (9.4%) cases were categorized as not involving drug abuse. Only 30 (3.3%) of the drug abuse cases involved oxycodone as the single reported chemical entity; of these, 12 cases had OxyContin identified as a source of oxycodone. Of the 919 drug abuse cases, the vast majority (N = 889, 96.7%) were multiple drug abuse deaths in which there was at least one other plausible contributory drug in addition to oxycodone. The most prevalent drug combinations were oxycodone in combination with benzodiazepines, alcohol, cocaine, other narcotics, marijuana, or antidepressants. Using the DAWN definitions, drug abuse cases were further categorized as drug-induced or drug-related. A total of 851 (92.6%) cases met the criteria for classification as being drug-induced, and the remaining 68 (7.4%) cases were categorized as drug-related. Cause of death (COD) statements from the originating ME/C indicated a general recognition of the role of abuse of multiple drugs in causing fatalities. Approximately 70% of the 889 cases in the multiple-drug-induced categories were listed in the COD or contributing COD statements as multiple-drug deaths. A variety of terms were employed in the COD statements to indicate multiple drug involvement such as \"polydrug toxicity\", \"polypharmacy\", \"multiple drug poisoning\", and \"polypharmaceutical overdose\". The system for death classification employed in this study recognizes the problems inherent in COD attribution when multiple drugs are involved. Use of this new system for reporting mortality data in future studies involving opioids is recommended.", 
    "66": "Action of 2-amino-5-bromo-2'-chlorobenzophenone (ABPH), a metabolite of phenazepam, on currents evoked by the activation of glycine and glutamate NMDA receptors has been investigated in enzymatically isolated hippocampal rat pyramidal neurones. It is demonstrated that 3-10 microM ABPH caused an inhibitory effect on glycine receptors which was more prominent after pre-incubation with the drug. Peak amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated currents was weakly potentiated after prolonged (4-6 min) incubation with 10 microM ABPH. Thus, the effects of the benzophenone metabolites should be taken into account when analysing the action of phenazepam and other benzodiazepine drugs.", 
    "67": "Phosphorothioate compounds are widely used in agriculture and public health for the control of unwanted pests. The phosphorothioate parathion was metabolised to the toxic metabolite paraoxon (0.038-0.683 nmol/min per mg protein) and p-nitrophenol (0.023-2.10 nmol/min per mg protein) by human liver microsomes ( n=27) in an NADPH-dependent reaction. There was a significant correlation ( P<0.02) between nifedipine oxidation and paraoxon formation from parathion (200 micro M) by human liver microsomes and with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 expression ( P<0.05), although not with midazolam 1'-hydroxylation or testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation. Paclitaxel 6'-hydroxylation and CYP2C8 expression correlated with paraoxon formation ( P<0.01), indicating CYP2C8 involvement. Of nine recombinant P450 isoforms, CYPs 3A4, 3A5, 1A2 and 2D6 activated parathion to paraoxon at the highest rates (6.5, 8.5, 5.7 and 6.2 pmol/pmol P450 per h) with K(m) values of 12.6, 2.7, 1.5 and 9.2 micro M, respectively. Similar K(m) values were seen with the human liver microsomes. These data indicate that CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8, which constitute up to 40% of human liver P450s, are the most significant participants in the metabolism of parathion. However, several other isoforms could play an important role when CYP3A and CYP2C8 are poorly expressed due to environmental factors or the presence of a genetic polymorphism.",

    "69": "The current study evaluated whether CGS15943 would maintain self-administration and reinstate extinguished lever responding previously maintained by cocaine (i.e. cocaine-seeking) or by food (i.e. food-seeking). Reinstatement with CGS15943 was compared to cocaine, caffeine, and alprazolam.", 
    "70": "Up to 30 injections of 0.032 mg/kg cocaine or 30 deliveries of 1-g food pellets were available under a fixed ratio (FR10) schedule of reinforcement during daily 2-h sessions. For reinstatement tests, lever responses were extinguished by substituting saline for cocaine or by removing pellets from the mechanical feeder. After extinction of lever responding, acute \"priming\" doses (mg/kg, IV) of cocaine (0.1-3.2), the adenosine receptor antagonists caffeine (0.1-1.8) and CGS15943 (0.032-0.32) or the benzodiazepine receptor agonist alprazolam (0.1-1.8 mg/kg) were administered. The intravenous reinforcing effects of CGS15943 were also evaluated; each dose of CGS15943 (0.001-0.032 mg/kg) was substituted for cocaine for at least 10 days and until self-injection was relatively stable.", 
    "71": "Cocaine, caffeine and CGS15943, dose-dependently increased cocaine-seeking, where as alprazolam did not. Cocaine, caffeine and CGS15943 did not increase food-seeking. CGS15943 reinstated cocaine-seeking at rates that were comparable to those produced by cocaine. Pretreatment with the adenosine A(2) agonist CGS21680 decreased CGS15943-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking. In self-injection testing, CGS15943 was self-administered at levels greater than vehicle. An inverted U-shaped dose-effect function was obtained with peak mean rates maintained by 0.01 mg/kg CGS15943.", 
    "72": "The adenosine antagonist CGS15943 reinstated cocaine-seeking and functioned as an intravenous reinforcer. The finding that CGS21680 produced a rightward shift in the CGS15943 reinstatement dose-effect curve supports a role of adenosine mechanisms in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior.",

    "77": "Of patients using benzodiazepines for more than 1 month, 47% developed dependence to these compounds. Benzodiazepine dependence was more prevalent among women who were middle aged, separated, of low educational background, unemployed or housewives. Patients using short half-life benzodiazepines registered higher rates of dependence as well as those using higher doses or the patients with longer use. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis shows that benzodiazepine dependence was closely related only to three of the variables considered: the benzodiazepine dose used, the duration of this use and to the concomitant use of antidepressants.", 
    "78": "The distribution of dose and length of treatment shows no evidence of pharmacological tolerance, neither in the whole sample nor in those patients with addiction (SDS+), reinforcing the idea that psychological dependence (addiction) is more relevant than pharmacological or physiological dependence in benzodiazepine chronic use.",

Recent studies suggest that individualized feedback and education to physicians may improve drug prescribing. In this study, we evaluated an intervention to address the inappropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines for elderly patients.", 
    "80": "We identified 1624 primary care physicians who wrote at least 10 prescriptions for the target drugs in a 2-month period and randomly assigned these physicians to the intervention group or the control group. We obtained data from the Ontario Drug Benefit claims database, which covers all Ontario residents aged 65 years and over for drugs selected from a minimally restrictive formulary. Every 2 months for 6 months, confidential profiles of benzodiazepine prescription use coupled with evidence-based educational bulletins were mailed to the intervention group. The control group received feedback and educational bulletins about first-line antihypertension drug prescribing for elderly patients. Our main outcome measures were reductions in the proportion of each physician's total benzodiazepine prescriptions for long-acting agents, combinations of benzodiazepines with other psychoactive medications (including other benzodiazepines) and long-term benzodiazepine therapy.", 
    "81": "After randomization, 168 physicians agreed to be in the intervention group and 206 in the control group. Their demographic and prescribing characteristics were similar. Although the proportion of long-acting benzodiazepine prescriptions decreased by 0.7% in the intervention group between the baseline period and the end of the intervention period (from 20.3%, or a mean of 29.5 prescriptions, to 19.6%, or a mean of 27.7 prescriptions) and increased by 1.1% in the control group (from 19.8%, or a mean of 26.4 prescriptions, to 20.9%, or a mean of 27.7 prescriptions) (p = 0.036), this difference was not clinically significant. There was no significant difference over the study period in either combination prescribing of benzodiazepines or in prescriptions for long-term benzodiazepine therapy.",

    "84": "Patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and a current manic or mixed episode (confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Patient Edition) (N=210) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 3 weeks of double-blind treatment with ziprasidone (40-80 mg twice daily) or placebo. Efficacy was assessed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Change Version (which contains the Mania Rating Scale), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity scale, CGI improvement scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Primary efficacy variables were differences from baseline to endpoint (last observation carried forward) in mean Mania Rating Scale and CGI severity scale scores between the ziprasidone and placebo groups. Safety evaluations included monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram results, and clinical laboratory values and assessment of movement disorders and akathisia.", 
    "85": "Ziprasidone produced rapid, sustained improvements relative to baseline and placebo on all primary and most secondary efficacy measures at endpoint. Significant improvements were typically observed within 2 days after treatment commenced and were maintained throughout the 3 weeks. Ziprasidone was well tolerated and associated with a low rate of extrapyramidal symptoms; neither weight gain nor clinically significant changes in vital signs or other safety parameters were observed with ziprasidone.",

    "87": "A simple and reliable assay for diazepam, nitrazepam and flunitrazepam in tablets by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-densitometry is described. A quantity of a ground tablet mass, equal to the average weight of one tablet was sonicated in MeOH, mixed with appropriate internal standard, filtered and either injected directly into the liquid chromatograph, or after evaporation and reconstitution of an aliquot of the extract, was spotted on a silica gel thin-layer plate. A variable UV detector, operated at 254 nm was employed in both procedures. A C18, reversed phase 7 microm column was used for HPLC analysis; the mobile phase was a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of MeOH (40 degrees C) and 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7, 80 degrees C). The TLC plate was developed in an unsaturated chromatographic chamber containing 100 ml chloroform-acetone (9:1); at room temperature, the mobile phase was allowed to travel 15 cm. The percentage of the active ingredient content of each tablet obtained by both procedures, was in the range of the stated amount except for one brand of diazepam tablets which contained approximately 23% less active ingredient than the minimum prescribed amount. The TLC densitometry, although yields slightly higher values than the HPLC method, is preferred due to its simplicity, ease and low cost.", 
    "88": "Behavioral suppression is observed when animals shift from a high to a lower magnitude of reward in comparison to animals that continuously receive the lower magnitude reward. As previously reported, systemic administration of benzodiazepines promotes recovery from this negative contrast. This study aimed to assess where the neural substrate(s) located in the limbic areas for diazepam to induce such recovery effects on negative contrast. With food-deprived rats, the negative contrast procedure was conducted by comparing a group consuming a 32% sucrose solution which was shifted to 4% with a group consuming only 4% sucrose throughout the experiment. Represented mainly by a decreased number of licks, the negative contrast effects were clearly shown in the control groups receiving the vehicle. Systemic injection of diazepam dose-dependently reduced this contrast. Further, this negative contrast effect was significantly attenuated by local infusion of diazepam (30 microg) into the amygdala, but no such effect was confirmed when diazepam was infused into the hippocampus. Together, the present study shows that a reliable anti-contrast effect can be induced by diazepam administration peripherally or locally infused into the amygdala. These data indicate that the amygdala is involved in the recovery effects of benzodiazepines on consummatory negative contrast.", 
    "89": "The present study has investigated the effect of posttreatment of the nonspecific inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), on the anticonvulsant effect of phenobarbitone and diazepam on picrotoxin-induced convulsions in rats. Phenobarbitone, which is known to inhibit convulsions by potentiating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity in the brain, did not inhibit the convulsive action of picrotoxin in L-NAME-posttreated animals. L-NAME produced no such interaction with diazepam, which inhibits convulsions through GABA potentiation as well as by a GABA-independent mechanism. L-arginine, the precursor of NO, increased the protective effect of both phenobarbitone and diazepam. These results suggest that a decreased synthesis of NO in the brain by the nonspecific inhibitors of NOS is likely to result in an impairment of the anticonvulsant effect of antiepileptics that inhibit convulsions solely by potentiating GABA activity in the brain.", 
    "90": "The electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of a rapid infusion of midazolam and sarmazenil following a bolus of midazolam were investigated in eight Welsh mountain ponies anaesthetized with 0.8% halothane in oxygen. The peak plasma concentration of midazolam was 2.13 +/- 0.34 ng/mL (mean +/- SD) occurring 5 min after the start of the infusion. Sarmazenil concentrations were not measured. The 95% spectral edge frequency of the EEG decreased by a maximum of 39.8 +/- 15.8%, 10 min after the start of the midazolam infusion. No changes were seen in median frequency of the EEG or the second differential of the middle latency auditory evoked response. The variability of median frequency (F50) and spectral edge frequency (F95) were reduced by a maximum of 80 +/- 7 and 84 +/- 7%, respectively. The sarmazenil infusion reversed the effects of a bolus of midazolam on the variability of F50 and the magnitude and variability of F95. The second differential of the middle latency auditory evoked potential (DD) was increased by 56.4 +/- 69.3%, 10 min after the start of the sarmazenil infusion. There were no statistically significant differences in EEG variables between the baseline of the midazolam infusion and 10 min after the start of the sarmazenil infusion. Midazolam infusion resulted in specific and unusual changes in the EEG of anaesthetized ponies. These changes were completely reversed by sarmazenil infusion. The data presented suggest that sarmazenil has no intrinsic effect upon the EEG.", 
    "91": "The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the efficacy of augmentation of clomipramine (CMI) by tandospirone in 36 untreated outpatients with major depressive disorder. Twelve patients were treated with CMI and tandospirone (T group), 12 with CMI and diazepam (D group) and 12 with CMI alone (C group) for 6 weeks. No statistically significant differences in the percentage improvement of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17 items; HDRS-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (14 items; HARS-14) scores were shown among the three treatment groups. However, at 2 weeks, the percentage improvement of HDRS-17 score in the T group tended to be higher than that in the D and C groups, although there was no statistically significant difference among the three treatment groups. No change in plasma prolactin level or adverse events was induced by the addition of tandospirone. These results suggest that 6 weeks of treatment with tandospirone or diazepam was not effective for augmentation of CMI in major depressive disorder patients. However, augmentation of antidepressants by tandospirone administration for a few weeks might induce early expression of antidepressive effects.", 
    "92": "Child and adolescent catatonia has been poorly investigated. A literature review was undertaken to clarify phenomenology, diagnosis, etiology, and treatment as well as ethical problems of catatonia in childhood and adolescence. Although there are no accepted standardized criteria for catatonia in childhood and adolescence, catatonic features described by child psychiatrists are similar to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn; DSM-IV) criteria for catatonia. With respect to etiology, the motor and behavioral symptoms that are part of catatonia bear some similarities with those seen in autism. Several case reports suggest an association between catatonia and general medical conditions. Certain drugs abused by youngsters as well as prescribed medicine can induce catatonia. Regarding catatonic cases originally diagnosed as schizophrenia, it is unclear whether all of these cases should be identified as schizophrenia or whether some of them are pervasive developmental disorders that develop psychic features in adolescence. Environmental changes preceding the onset of catatonia in patients with mood disorder play a possibly important role. Examples that suggest stress-induced catatonia, although rare, also exist. A few patients exhibit features of malignant catatonia, some without taking neuroleptics and others having taken them. Benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy are considered to be effective treatments for catatonic youngsters.", 
    "93": "In alcohol-dependent in-patients, an adequate drug prophylaxis should be made in order to lower the degree of a developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) or to prevent a life-threatening delirium tremens. Pre-condition of successful therapy is a precise diagnosis. In patients, the beginning of whose abstinence is known, carefully-targeted pharmacological interventions can prevent severe imbalances of neurotransmitters. Typical time courses of destabilisation of neural balances should be considered. Since there is no single drug which is able to influence various transmitter systems, normally the use of drug combinations is necessary. In ENT-patients, traumatologic patients and patients from the department of maxillo-facial surgery, screening methods based on a simply-structured questionnaire relating to information from the patient and his surroundings and selected laboratory parameters should be used. High-risk patients who could get an AWS or delirium tremens should be treated prophylactically during their oral premedication period. Important drugs for successful prophylaxis of an AWS are benzodiazepines, clonidin, magnesium and vitamin B 1. A close-meshed control of the glucose metabolism, electrolyte and acid-base balance should be performed. Neuroleptica can be used if there is any indication for their adjuvant use. In severe cases that require deep sedation or hypnosis, propofol or gamma-hydroxy-butyric acid should be used. Perioperative infusion of alcohol as a prophylactic agent against delirium tremens is regarded as an obsolete therapeutic measure for ethical reasons and because equally good or better results can be achieved by carefully-targeted drug therapy. Due to its easy use, however, the application of alcohol has not yet completely disappeared from the therapeutic spectrum.", 
    "94": "Delirium is mental dysfunctions occurring as impaired attentional and memory systems with disturbances of consciousness, affectivity, psychomotor activity and sleep patterns. Numerous factors and underlying diseases may be responsible for these non-specific symptoms. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of preadmission history and current clinical status, supplemented by laboratory and extended technical diagnostic procedures, are always required. If delirium occurs in connection with emergency admission to hospital, an organic disease can most regularly be found. Due to its rapid time of onset and minor side-effects, the intravenous injection of 2.0 g gamma-hydroxybutyric acid is preferred for sedation of extremely agitated patients. Neuroleptic drugs are indicated in psychiatric patients. A central anticholinergic syndrome in the early postoperative period causative of the symptoms of delirium may respond to intravenous injection of physostigmine. Most of the time, however, these acute disturbances of brain function are best treated by correction of homeostatic imbalances, restoration of cardiovascular and respiratory stability and alleviation of pain. Postoperative delirium occurring two or more days later is frequently due to respiratory distress, followed by sepsis, alcohol withdrawal and many other causes including heart failure, exsiccosis and side-effects of drugs. In intensive care patients, delirium may be caused, for example, by withdrawal (alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines), the onset of sepsis (often venous catheter related), side-effects of drugs, problems of communication, sleep deprivation and others. Treatment should focus on finding the right approach. Personal care should be intensified and include help from family members. Most problems arise from agitated, non-cooperative patients. Treatment with clonidine, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid or neuroleptic drugs like perazin and haloperidol may be required to reduce agitation and the activation of sympathetic influence.", 
    "95": "A series of compounds comprising the thiocarboximidopyrazolyl 5, the phenylpyrazolyl 6, the dimethylpyrazolyl 7, the nitrophenylpyrazolyl 8, the dimethyloxazolyl 9, the benzoxazepinyl 10, and pyrimidyl 11 a-c derivatives of 3-(2-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-ylazo)pentane-2, 4-dione was synthesized. Moreover, 5-amino-2-methylbenzimidazole (3) was reacted with phthalic anhydride or maleic anhydride in acetic acid or in toluene to produce 12-15. Treating 5, 6-diamino-2-methylbenzimidazole (16) with ethyl cyanoacetate or diethyl malonate or acetyl acetone leads to the formation of the benzodiazepine derivatives 17-20. The cytotoxic activity of the compounds 2, 7, 9, 10, and 11 was tested against 60 types of human cancer cell lines. Compounds 7 and 9 were found to be the most potent.", 
    "96": "Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most important neurological emergencies. We describe the most recent aspects concerning the definition, classification, aetiology, physiopathological and epidemiological aspects of SE, together with the therapeutic principles and pharmacotherapy in adults and adolescents. The therapeutic control of SE becomes more difficult as its duration becomes longer, and the possibility of causing permanent neurological damage also increases. Treatment is more effective when it is performed following a protocol. The benzodiazepines are still a first line of treatment. Home care treatment of patients with recurring seizures or important risk factors for developing SE could help to improve the future response to therapy and, therefore, its prognosis. Thus, several therapies involving benzodiazepines are developed which can be administered rectally, nasally and sublingually. In the future, treatment may include the use of neuroprotective drugs that reduce the morbidity and mortality of SE and prevent cell death. In spite of the progress made in understanding SE, there are still certain shortcomings that must be solved, i.e. mistakes made during diagnosis, a need for wider availability of electrographic controls, the basic physiopathological mechanisms require further research, and controlled studies with currently available antiepileptic drugs and others that have only recently appeared should be conducted in order to evaluate their therapeutic effectiveness, in both home care and hospitalised patients (refractory SE).", 
    "97": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a menstrual cycle-linked condition with both mental and physical symptoms. Most women of fertile age experience cyclical changes but consider them normal and not requiring treatment. Up to 30% of women feel a need for treatment. The aetiology is still unclear, but sex steroids produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary are thought to be symptom provoking, as the cyclicity disappears in anovulatory cycles when a corpus luteum is not formed. Progestogens and progesterone together with estrogen are able to induce similar symptoms as seen in PMS. Symptom severity is sensitive to the dosage of estrogen. The response systems within the brain known to be involved in PMS symptoms are the serotonin and GABA systems. Progesterone metabolites, especially allopregnanolone, are neuroactive, acting via the GABA system in the brain. Allopregnanolone has similar effects as benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol; all these substances are known to induce adverse mood effects at low dosages in humans and animals. SSRIs and substances inhibiting ovulation, such as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, have proven to be effective treatments. To avoid adverse effects when high dosages of GnRH agonists are used, add-back hormone replacement therapy is recommended. Spironolactone also has a beneficial effect, although not as much as SSRIs and GnRH agonists.", 
    "98": "Typical antipsychotics exert their effect by blocking post-synaptic dopaminergic receptors; blockade of the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways are therapeutic and help reduce positive psychotic symptoms but blockade of the nigro-striatal pathway produces extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE). Post clozapine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of four newer atypical antipsychotics; risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia. Because of their dual serotonin and dopamine receptor blocking abilities, atypical antipsychotics have greater efficacy (especially for negative symptoms) and fewer EPSE when compared to the typical antipsychotics. Given the lack of studies directly comparing these agents, we used the Physician Desk Reference (PDR) to calculate the treatment emergent placebo adjusted side effects for these atypical antipsychotics. The results are then presented in an easy to read table. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparison study involving these four newer antipsychotic agents.",

    "104": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is so frequently repeated or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting condition. Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.", 
    "105": "Puberty, a part of adolescence, is a time of rapid physical, psychological, and psychosocial changes. Variability in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion occurs due to physical and hormonal changes, as well as those of body composition. Environmental factors affecting nutrition and compliance in the pubescent individual also affect success in achieving desired pharmacologic effects while minimizing toxicities. Based on available data, pharmacologic research has been relatively inadequate in providing information about drug disposition during puberty. The majority of available studies have neglected to provide staging for pubescent adolescents or have altogether excluded this population from their investigations. However, data are available that describe the effects of puberty on the pharmacokinetics of agents such as theophylline, digoxin, carbamazepine, lamotragine, vigabatrin and benzodiazepines.To date, few clinically significant changes in drug disposition have been noted during puberty. However, factors such as compliance, concomitant drug use, and the potentially rebellious nature of adolescents must be taken into consideration in the medical management of the adolescent.", 
    "106": "Dopamine D(2) blocking typical antipsychotic drugs are known to change the cerebral perfusion patterns of schizophrenic patients, especially in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. In recent years atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, which have high serotonin 5-HT(2A)/dopamine D(2) occupation ratios, have been shown to be more effective in the treatment of schizophrenia symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine in a within-subject design. Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia participated as subjects in the study. Each subject was scanned in a medication-free state and after 6 weeks of 10 mg/day fixed dose olanzapine treatment. Despite the clinical improvement seen in the patients, repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that olanzapine produced no significant changes in cortical rCBF after the six-week treatment. This finding indicates that unlike typical antipsychotics olanzapine has no negative effect on cortical cerebral perfusion patterns of schizophrenic patients.", 
    "107": "The aim of this study was to determine if central GABA mechanisms are involved in the cardiac vagal withdrawal at the beginning of exercise in man. We tested whether GABA-enhancing effects of a benzodiazepine could be observed in the HR change (R-R interval) immediately following the onset of a brief (10s) isometric contraction (60 % maximum) of the biceps muscle. The difference between the change in R-R interval occurring during the same phase of respiration was compared for placebo (Pla) and 10 mg oral diazepam (Dz) treatment in a double blind, crossover trial. ECG, blood pressure, respiration and biceps muscle tension were recorded. The subjects breathed to a metronome and R-R interval measurements were plotted for early and late inspiration and early and late expiration. The mean values of the first late expiration R-R interval immediately following the start of contraction in early expiration were compared to the same measurements without contraction. Contractions initiated following diazepam treatment resulted in a significantly greater reduction in R-R interval (P < 0.05) implying that GABAergic suppression of cardiac vagal outflow may be responsible for contraction-induced tachycardia in man.",

The benzothiazepine CGP37157 inhibited mNCE activity in INS-1 cells (50% inhibition at IC(50) = 1.5 micro mol/l) and increased the glucose-induced rise in mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](m)) 2.1 times. Cellular ATP content was increased by 13% in INS-1 cells and by 49% in rat islets by CGP37157 (1 micro mol/l). Krebs cycle flux was also stimulated by CGP37157 when glucose was present. Insulin secretion was increased in a glucose-dependent manner by CGP37157 in both INS-1 cells and islets. In islets, CGP37157 increased insulin secretion dose dependently (half-maximal efficacy at EC(50) = 0.06 micro mol/l) at 8 mmol/l glucose and shifted the glucose dose response curve to the left. In perifused islets, mNCE inhibition had no effect on insulin secretion at 2.8 mmol/l glucose but increased insulin secretion by 46% at 11 mmol/l glucose. The effects of CGP37157 could not be attributed to interactions with the plasma membrane sodium calcium exchanger, L-type calcium channels, ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, or [Ca(2+)](m) uniporter. In hyperglycemic clamp studies of Wistar rats, CGP37157 increased plasma insulin and C-peptide levels only during the hyperglycemic phase of the study. These results illustrate the potential utility of agents that affect mitochondrial metabolism as novel insulin secretagogues.", 
    "109": "Studies of nonhuman primate models have been useful in defining anxious temperament as an individual's stable set of physiologic and behavioral responses and in providing insights regarding human anxiety. Anxious temperament in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) is marked by excessive anxiety, exaggerated defensive behavioral responses, extreme asymmetric right frontal brain electrical activity, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone and plasma cortisol. In the human brain, extreme asymmetric right frontal activation is likewise associated with negative affect and anxious disposition. Our studies of infant rhesus monkeys using the human intruder paradigm allow us to investigate individual differences in fear-related defensive behavioral responses and suggest that responses to threatening stimuli are mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid and benzodiazepine receptors. Ongoing studies with nonhuman primates in our laboratory are further examining the neurochemistry underlying individual differences in anxious temperament. We believe that these studies will provide insights into the adaptive and maladaptive responses of humans as they relate to psychopathology as associated with anxiety.", 
    "110": "Alterations in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex and GABA neurotransmission influence the reinforcing and intoxicating effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines. Chronic modulation of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex plays a major role in central nervous system dysregulation during alcohol abstinence. Withdrawal symptoms stem in part from a decreased GABAergic inhibitory function and an increase in glutamatergic excitatory function. GABA(A) receptors play a role in both reward and withdrawal phenomena from alcohol and sedative-hypnotics. Although less well understood, GABA(B) receptor complexes appear to play a role in inhibition of motivation and diminish relapse potential to reinforcing drugs. Evidence suggests that long-term alcohol use and concomitant serial withdrawals permanently alter GABAergic function, down-regulate benzodiazepine binding sites, and in preclinical models lead to cell death. Benzodiazepines have substantial drawbacks in the treatment of substance use-related disorders that include interactions with alcohol, rebound effects, alcohol priming, and the risk of supplanting alcohol dependency with addiction to both alcohol and benzodiazepines. Polysubstance-dependent individuals frequently self-medicate with benzodiazepines. Selective GABA agents with novel mechanisms of action have anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and reward inhibition profiles that have potential in treating substance use and withdrawal and enhancing relapse prevention with less liability than benzodiazepines. The GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen has promise in relapse prevention in a number of substance dependence disorders. The GABA(A) and GABA(B) pump reuptake inhibitor tiagabine has potential for managing alcohol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal and also possibly a role in relapse prevention.", 
    "111": "Recent advances in neuroscience and understanding in the etiology of anxiety have led researchers to new targets for treatments that are proving to be at least as effective as benzodiazepines, which have been the traditional treatment for anxiety for over 40 years. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system has long been targeted in anxiety interventions via benzodiazepines, but better understanding of its role in anxiety disorders has led to the development of partial benzodiazepine-GABA receptor antagonists and agents that target specific subunits of the GABA-A receptor and that manipulate GABA levels. The recognition that antidepressants are effective in anxiety even in nondepressed patients has caused researchers to develop antianxiety agents that affect the serotonin and norepinephrine systems. Other neurotransmitter systems such as corticotropin-releasing factor and substance P appear to be abnormally regulated in patients with anxiety disorders, so antagonists of these neurotransmitters may prove to be beneficial anxiolytics. Meanwhile, antistress and antianxiety effects through neurogenesis may be possible with the use of agents that decrease glutamate neurotransmission, such as metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists. Finally, the stimulation of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which appears to enhance neurogenesis, may also prove to have anxiolytic effects.", 
    "112": "Anxiety stems from and perpetuates dysregulation of neurobiological systems, but the exact mechanisms of anxiety disorders are still only partially understood. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter known to counterbalance the action of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Several pharmacologic agents target the GABA system and modulate the overall effect of GABA. This article highlights multiple neurobiological interactions that play a role in anxiety and reviews selected studies of plasma neurosteroid levels, plasma GABA levels, and benzodiazepine binding site sensitivity and density in patients with anxiety disorders. The article concludes with further support for the role of the GABA system in anxiety by summarizing the current evidence supporting the use of novel GABAergic agents including tiagabine in the treatment of anxiety disorders.", 
    "113": "Although anxiety disorders were classified as neurotic disorders and not systematically studied before DSM-III, researchers and clinicians have been searching for effective, safe agents to treat anxiety symptoms and disorders for over a century. In that time, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and many classes of antidepressants have been used as anxiolytics, all with side effect profiles that made them less than optimal treatments for anxiety. The recognition of the role of GABA in anxiety disorders has led researchers to develop anxiolytics that target GABA. The long-sought-after class of anxiolytics that are both effective and safe may be found in the new research being conducted with agents that selectively target GABA receptors and their subtypes.", 
    "114": "A new approach to the synthesis of 1,4-benzodiazepines and 3-amino-1,4-benzodiazepines, which employs the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of an imidoyl chloride with an organometallic reagent as the key step, is described. A five-step synthesis of a key intermediate is described and it is shown that in only four further steps (three couplings and a TFA-mediated BOC-deprotection) a wide variety of N1-, C3-amino-, C5-carbon-, or nitrogen-substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines can be synthesized.", 
    "115": "Febrile seizures are the most common seizure disorder seen in children and most often occur between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Febrile seizures are usually self-limited and need no further neurodiagnostic evaluation. Rarely does medication need to be prescribed. For children with prolonged or multiple febrile seizures, diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) is a safe and effective treatment. There are no significant long-term risks associated with febrile seizures.", 
    "116": "It has recently been demonstrated that patients with Angelman's syndrome who exhibited a deletion on cytogenetic tests show more severe clinical pictures with drug-resistant epilepsy than patients with Angelman's syndrome not carrying the deletion. To verify if this difference in clinical severity can be attributed to genes for the three gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor subunits (GABRB3, GABRA5, GABRG3) located in the deleted region, a possible modification of peripheral markers of the GABAergic system was investigated in 12 subjects with Angelman's syndrome and 20 age-matched subjects (8 with idiopathic epilepsy and 12 not affected by neurologic diseases). The results confirmed a more severe clinical picture, and epilepsy syndrome in particular, in Angelman's syndrome patients with deletions versus patients without deletions. In contrast, biochemical study (based on dosage of plasma levels of GABA and diazepam binding inhibitor, an endogenous ligand of GABAA and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, showed contradictory results: patients with Angelman's syndrome showed significantly higher levels of GABA and diazepam binding inhibitor than patients without neurologic impairment but significantly lower levels than epileptic controls.", 
    "117": "There is no generally accepted treatment for tardive dyskinesia following intake of neuroleptics. Many compounds with effects on serotonine, GABA, cholinergic or dopamine receptors have been clinically useful. We report on a 71-year-old female patient suffering from orofacial tardive dyskinesia after treatment with haloperidol, which did not respond to monotherapy with antidyskinetic drugs. The syndrome disappeared almost completely within two weeks after a multidrug approach consisting of tetrabenazine, olanzapine and tiapride. A combination of antidyskinetic drugs should be considered in patients with severe tardive dyskinesia.", 
    "118": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of a timed-release (TR) drug formulation can avoid unfavorable pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions in vivo. First, the effects of the time interval between administration of midazolam and diltiazem on the known drug-drug interaction between these drugs were investigated in dogs. When dogs were given midazolam orally at the same time they were orally given an aqueous diltiazem solution, the area under the plasma concentration-time curves of midazolam increased significantly compared with that of midazolam given orally in the absence of diltiazem. However, there was no significant difference in pharmacokinetics of midazolam when the diltiazem solution was administered 1-2 h after midazolam. Tests on a TR formulation containing diltiazem demonstrated that the first appearance of diltiazem in plasma occurs at 2.6 +/- 0.5 h in dogs. Subsequent tests showed that the plasma concentration-time profile of midazolam after concurrent oral administration of the diltiazem TR formulation was almost the same as that of midazolam administered alone. These results demonstrate that a TR formulation of diltiazem can avoid the interaction between diltiazem and midazolam by creating a time interval between absorption of drugs in vivo, without the need for closely controlling the time of drug administration.", 
    "119": "Inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) in the mammalian cortex probably contribute to brain development and to maintaining tonic inhibition. Given their presence throughout the cortex, their modulation likely has important physiological consequences. Although benzodiazepines potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors (GABAARs), they may also modulate GlyRs because binding studies initially suggested that they act at GlyRs. Furthermore, their diminished ability to potentiate neonatal GABAARs suggests that they may exert their beneficial clinical effects at another site in the developing brain. Therefore we examined the effect of benzodiazepines on whole cell currents mediated by GlyRs in cultured embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons. First, we determined the GlyR subunit composition in this preparation. Glycine, beta-alanine, and taurine activate strychnine-sensitive chloride currents in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal concentrations of the three agonists produce equal, nonadditive responses as expected of full agonists. The pharmacological properties of the GlyR currents including their pattern of modulation by picrotoxinin, picrotin, and tropisetron indicate that GlyRs consist of alpha2beta heteromers and alpha2 homomers. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) studies confirmed the presence of alpha2 and beta subunits. Second, we found that micromolar concentrations of some benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide and nitrazepam, inhibit GlyR currents. Nitrazepam inhibition of GlyRs is noncompetitive, is not voltage dependent, and does not reflect enhanced desensitization. Thus benzodiazepines allosterically inhibit alpha2-containing GlyRs in embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons via a \"low\"-affinity site.", 
    "120": "The reaction of proper N,N-dialkyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5-amines (1) with N-chlorosuccinimide afforded their 4-chloroderivatives 3 which in turn were treated with cyclic amines to give the corresponding 4,5-diaminoderivatives 4. The N,N-dialkyl-4H-imidazo[1,2-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5-amines (5) were prepared starting from suitable 4-(dialkylamino)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-ones (8), through multistep synthetic routes. At the 200 mg kg(-1) os dose, some compounds 3 and 4 showed notable analgesic or anti-inflammatory activity but no antipyretic properties, whereas the 5-(dibutylamino) derivatives 5b and 5f proved to be significantly endowed with all these activities. Almost all the compounds 3, 4 and 5 did not show acute toxicity in mice up to 800 mg kg(-1) os dose.", 
    "121": "Alpidem analogues containing a GABA (1-3) or glycine (4-6) moiety were synthesized and their interaction with the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex at central (CBR) and peripheral (PBR) level was evaluated. In particular, their ability to modulate the specific binding of [3H]-GABA to washed membrane preparations from the rat cerebral cortex, as well as their effects on human recombinant GABA(A) receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes, were assessed. Results from these in vitro assays showed that the most active compounds were 1 and 4. Intraperitoneal administration of compound 1 at a dose of 150 mg/kg significantly antagonized pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in rats and the protective effects were evident for 90 min. However, compound 4 failed to interact with strychnine-sensitive Gly-binding sites. Consistent with these binding results, intraperitoneal administration of compound 4 at 150 mg/kg showed no effect against convulsions induced by strychnine, except for a prolonged time of the latency of convulsions. The results obtained suggest that compound 1 possesses interesting anticonvulsant activity and deserves further investigation as a novel lipophilic GABA derivative.",

Analysis 1 included 4 randomized studies (838 patients), analysis 2 included 2 randomized studies (n = 716), and analysis 3 assessed 5 clinical studies for olanzapine (n = 928) and 3 for risperidone (n = 290). Odds ratios were estimated by the fixed-effect model.", 
    "125": "The risk of treatment discontinuation (analysis 1) was significantly greater for risperidone than for olanzapine (42% vs. 33%, respectively). The response rates were identical for the 2 drugs (analysis 2). A slightly better pattern of maintenance of response was found for olanzapine (analysis 3).",

    "127": "The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel C-8 linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD)-imidazole polyamide conjugates (1-5) are described that involve mercuric chloride-mediated cyclization of the corresponding amino diethyl thioacetals. The compounds were prepared with varying numbers of imidazole- and pyrrole-containing polyamides in order to probe the structural requirements for optimal in vitro antitumor activity. These compounds were tested against a panel of human cancer cells by the National Cancer Institute, demonstrating that the compounds exhibited a higher level of cytotoxic activity than the existing natural and synthetic pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines. The data presented show that the length of the polyamides and also the type of heterocycle play important roles in this series of compounds for anticancer activity. Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 5 have significant cytotoxic activity against the various types of cancer cell lines. It appears that cytotoxic activity is related to both the length and the heterocycles of the polyamides. Compound 1 exhibited a wide spectrum of anticancer activities against all cell lines in nine cancer panels and was especially effective against colon cancer, melanoma, and renal cancer and breast cancer, however, compound 4 did not exhibit any significant anticancer activity. This study found that PBD-imidazole polyamide conjugates are highly cytotoxic against many human cancer cell lines in comparison with the PBD-pyrrole polyamide conjugates.", 
    "128": "The role of simple reaction time in schizophrenia has been extensively reported to date in professional literature. However, most studies have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single measurement. The aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia.", 
    "129": "Seventeen in-patients suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria) and twenty matched, healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. The patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4 mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at a fixed dosage in the first week and thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. Since no differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpson Angus Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Reaction time was measured with the Alpha apparatus, connected to a personal computer. All assessments and measurements were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study.",

After eight weeks of treatment the reaction time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). Furthermore, the improved reaction time in the patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or with improved extrapyramidal symptoms.",
