Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials comparing inhaled volatile (desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane) sedation to intravenous midazolam or propofol. Primary outcome assessed the effect of volatile-based sedation on extubation times (time between discontinuing sedation and tracheal extubation). Secondary outcomes included time to obey verbal commands, proportion of time spent in target sedation, nausea and vomiting, mortality, length of intensive care unit, and length of hospital stay. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I statistic. Outcomes were assessed using a random or fixed-effects model depending on heterogeneity.",

    "4": "The goal of this study was to assess how often potentially inappropriate medicines are used by the elderly at home, and analyze its clinical significance. This is a retrospective cross-sectional study, a segment of a study on the use of medication conducted at a public hospital. Inappropriate medication was classified according to the three criteria in the 2012 Beers List. 190 elderly were included in this study; the prevalence of the use of inappropriate medicines was 44.2%. The therapeutic classes of most often used inappropriate medicines were non-steroid anti-inflammatories, cardiovascular agents, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. We found a positive association between the use of inappropriate medicines and polypharmacy, polypathology and hypertension. The 2013 Rename identified 35 inappropriate drugs (34.3%). The study showed a high prevalence of using inappropriate medicines by the elderly. The clinical consequences of using inappropriate medicines are important for public health due to the risk of adverse events and a negative impact on elderly functionality. When it comes to caring for the elderly, it is important to develop measures to foster the rational use of medication.",

Bivariate linear regression analyses showed that presence of sleep disturbances was associated with fewer years of education, use of alcohol, the number of chronic diseases, higher pain intensity scores, use of more benzodiazepines, more anxiety and severity of depressive symptoms. In multivariate analyses, severity of depression appeared to be the only independent correlate.",

Extreme delta brush (EDB) is a distinctive EEG pattern that is can be suggestive of the diagnosis; however, the etiology of the EDB remains unclear. Furthermore, there is question with regard to its ictal or interictal nature. We report a 20-year-old woman with anti-NMDAR encephalitis whose serial video-EEG monitoring was obtained at 2, 2.5, 4, and 6 months after admission. There was a long-standing EDB lasting up to several hours, with no evolution in frequency, amplitude, or morphology, and without clear association her frequent orofacial dyskinesia. Intravenous benzodiazepine administrations did not change the EDB pattern. As her clinical symptoms improved, the EDB gradually became less prominent and less frequent, with complete resolution at 6 months after admission. These findings suggest that EDB is more likely a marker of the severity of the disease in contrast to an epileptic seizure and is useful for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response in conjunction with clinical improvement.", 
    "27": "Although benzodiazepines (BZDs) are used as the first-line treatment for status epilepticus, previous studies have shown inconsistent responses to BZDs in patients with cephalosporin-related non-convulsive status epilepticus. In this study, we investigated nine patients with cephalosporin-related impaired consciousness and their EEGs all showed generalized periodic discharges (GPDs). One of the patients received repetitive BZD injections without discontinuing cephalosporins, and neither his clinical symptoms nor GPDs on EEG responded to BZDs. Seven of the patients received BZDs after discontinuation of cephalosporins, but only two of them responded immediately to BZD administration. One of the patients did not receive BZDs or antiepileptic drugs, and this patient spontaneously recovered consciousness in one day after cephalosporins were discontinued. The changes in consciousness were reversible in all of the nine patients after cephalosporins were withdrawn. The administration of intravenous BZDs in cases with impairment of consciousness and GPDs secondary to cephalosporins may help in only a small number of patients. Cephalosporin withdrawal is ultimately mandatory in these patients.", 
    "28": "Dravet syndrome combines clonic generalized, focal or unilateral seizures, beginning within the first year of life, often triggered by hyperthermia whatever its cause, including pertussis vaccination. Long-lasting febrile seizures are frequent in infancy and repeat status epilepticus (SE) has negative prognostic value. Massive myoclonus, rare absences, complex partial seizures and generalized spikes may appear several years later. Myoclonic status may occur in childhood, but acute encephalopathy with febrile SE followed by ischemic lesions and psychomotor impairment, the most severe condition, occurs mainly within the first five years of life. Generalized tonic-clonic and tonic seizures in sleep predominate in adulthood. Non epileptic manifestations appear with age, including intellectual disability, ataxia and crouching gait. Incidence of SUDEP is high, whatever the age. SCN1A haploinsufficiency producing NaV1.1 dysfunction mainly affects GABAergic neurons. In cortical interneurons it explains epilepsy, in cerebellum the ataxia, in basal ganglia and motor neurons the crouching gait, in hypothalamus the thermodysregulation and sleep troubles, and dysfunction in all these structures contributes to psychomotor delay. Valproate, stiripentol, topiramate and bromide are the basis of antiepileptic treatment, whereas inhibitors of sodium channel worsen the condition. Benzodiazepines seem to facilitate acute encephalopathy when given chronically, and they should be restricted to SE. Ketogenic diet is useful in both chronic and acute conditions. Only targeting SCN1A haploinsufficiency and NaV1.1 dysfunction could improve non epileptic manifestations of this condition that deserves being considered as a disease, not only as an epilepsy syndrome.", 
    "29": "This multicenter, cross-sectional study with retrospective assessment of treatment response evaluated the current prescription trends and pharmacological treatment strategies applied in European university/academic psychiatric centers in unipolar depression. Altogether, 1181 adult in- and outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled in 9 academic sites in 8 European countries. Socio-demographic, clinical, and medication information were retrieved and the present symptom severity was assessed by the Montgomery and \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The symptom improvement during the current MDD episode was covered by retrospective MADRS measurements. Beyond descriptive statistics, analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Spearman correlation analyses were accomplished to determine the influence of symptom severity and treatment response on the prescription patterns. 53.4% of all MDD patients received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and 23.6% a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) as first-line treatment. The majority of participants (59.4%) were treated with polypharmaceutical strategies (median: 2 psychiatric compounds per patient) and for the number of individual drugs we found a significant correlation with the current MADRS total score and the MADRS total score change during the present depressive episode. Benzodiazepines (33.2% of patients), antidepressants (29.0%), antipsychotics (24.2%), and mood stabilizers (10.1%) were the most frequently prescribed adjunctive agents. There were no significant differences between the different psychopharmacological classes used as augmentors in terms of symptom severity and treatment response. In summary, this international cross-sectional study revealed the widespread use of polypharmaceutical treatment strategies in European tertiary psychiatric treatment centers for the management of MDD.", 
    "30": "A multivariate curve resolution - alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) analysis was used to quantify diazepam (DZP) in thirty commercial liquid formulations. MCR calibration was run on the UV spectrophotometric data of the commercial DZP samples over the range 200-400nm, allowing the resolution of the drug signal and then the excipients contained in all the formulations. A single model MCR for the determination of the drug in all samples was then built through the adoption of the correlation constraint. This model was optimized by an appropriate selection of the most useful wavelength ranges and then validated on external samples. DZP concentrations in the pharmaceutical formulations were measured by HPLC-DAD analysis. The performance of the MCR model was compared with that from application of classical partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results, in terms of error of prediction, were very satisfactory, reaching a relative error below of 1.66% against 2.56%, respectively.", 
    "31": "In the present study, we investigated the influence of diazepam (DZP) on the excretion of TOL by examining their urinary metabolites, hippuric acid (HA) and ortho-cresol (o-C). Male Wistar rats were exposed to TOL (20ppm) in a nose-only exposure chamber (6h/day, 5days/week for 6 weeks) with simultaneous administration of DZP (10mg/kg/day). Urinary o-C levels were determined by GC-MS, while HA, creatinine (CR), DZP and its metabolite, nordiazepam, were analysed by HPLC-DAD. The results of a Mann-Whitney U test showed that DZP influenced the urinary excretion of o-C (p<0.05). This pioneering study revealed that there was an interaction between DZP and TOL, probably by the inhibition of the CYP isoforms (CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2) involved in the oxidative metabolism of the solvent. This is relevant information to be considered in the biomonitoring of occupational toluene exposure.", 
    "32": "Several major medical and psychiatric organizations, including the American Geriatrics Society, advise against using benzodiazepines or nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics in older adults. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines continue to be massively prescribed to a group with the highest risk of serious adverse effects from these medications. This article summarizes legitimate reasons for prescribing benzodiazepines in the elderly, serious associated risks of prescribing them, particularly when not indicated, barriers physicians encounter in changing their prescription patterns, and evidence-based strategies on how to discontinue benzodiazepines in older patients. Although more research is needed, we propose several alternatives for treating insomnia and anxiety in older adults in primary care settings. These include nonpharmacological approaches such as sleep restriction-sleep compression therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety or insomnia, and as well as alternative pharmacological agents.",

However, the inappropriate use of psychoactive drugs in patients with dementia in nursing homes is still prevalent. The aim of this narrative review is to summarise and criticize the most recent data investigating the adverse outcomes related to psychoactive drug use, specifically antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines, in patients with dementia living in nursing homes. Searches of PubMed(\u00ae) and Web of Science(\u00ae) identified 790 potentially relevant articles, 23 of which were retained in this review. All studies investigated adverse outcomes of antipsychotics compared with non-use, or with antidepressants and/or benzodiazepine anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs. Several studies focused on the comparison between atypical and conventional antipsychotics, risperidone often being the reference. The most frequently reported outcomes were mortality (all-cause or cardiovascular), falls and/or fractures, and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. Overall, for mortality or falls, the highest risk is for benzodiazepines, followed by conventional antipsychotics, antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics. Whatever the drug, the patient must be carefully monitored during the first days of treatment, which needs to be initiated at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest duration. In light of the high risk of adverse outcomes (falls, cardiovascular events, infections, mortality) for patients with dementia living in nursing homes, all drugs must be carefully prescribed. However, further studies comparing pharmacological with non-pharmacological interventions, with a realistic consideration of the structural nursing home organisation, would be welcome.", 
    "34": "Deficits in recognition of facial expressions of emotion (RFEE) play a central role in the manifestation of anxiety disorders (AD). We systematically reviewed the literature to determine effects of drugs used in AD treatment on RFEE, based on outcomes of accuracy rate, reaction time, and intensity. Electronic databases, including Pubmed, PsycINFO, and Scielo, were used without time constraints. Twenty-six clinical/experimental studies on healthy subjects, focusing on 11 drugs, published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, were selected. We found that increased recognition of happiness was associated with acute use of citalopram, fluoxetine, duloxetine, and reboxetine. Increased and decreased recognition of negative emotions were associated with the use of selective serotonin and/or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, respectively. Benzodiazepine favored recognition of negative emotions. Differences in reaction time were rarely observed. Stimuli with distinct emotion intensities produced similar effects. Specific changes occurred in RFEE depending on the drug, its administration route and dose, and emotion valence. Evidences indicate significant effects on emotional processing relevant to clinical practice, particularly in treating patients with emotional disorders.", 
    "35": "Buccal delivery may be clinically beneficial for compounds with a high gastrointestinal and hepatic first pass metabolism or in situations where a fast systemic absorption is desired. The delivery of a crystalline low soluble compounds, e.g. diazepam, may be limited due to the low volume of saliva available to facilitate solvation in order to drive the permeation of drug through the buccal mucosa. Therefore, the present study investigated the potential benefits of administering diazepam either as an amorphous or as a crystalline form in mucoadhesive tablets to conscious G\u00f6ttingen mini-pigs. Presentation of the compound in the amorphous form lead to a very fast absorption, however, the obtained bioavailability was at the same level observed following buccal administration of a commercially immediate release tablet. Addition of chitosan, as a mucoadhesive excipient, resulted in a higher absolute bioavailability compared to tablets without chitosan. The absorption rate for the chitosan-based tablets was significant slower, probably due to the slower diffusion of the compound out of the tablet. In vitro release data was able to predict the variations in tmax, but otherwise no correlation could be found between in vitro and in vivo data.", 
    "36": "Lipid nanoparticles and their multiple designs have been considered appealing nanocarrier systems. Bringing the benefits of these nanosystems together with conventional coating technology clearly results in product differentiation. This work aimed at developing an innovative solid dosage form for oral administration based on tableting nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), coated with conventional polymer agents. NLC dispersions co-encapsulating olanzapine and simvastatin (Combo-NLC) were produced by high pressure homogenization, and evaluated in terms of scalability, drying procedure, tableting and performance from in vitro release, cytotoxicity and intestinal permeability stand points. Factorial design indicated that the scaling-up of the NLC production is clearly feasible. Spray-drying was the method selected to obtain dry particles, not only because it consists of a single step procedure, but also because it facilitates the coating process of NLC with different polymers. Modified NLC formulations with the polymers allowed obtaining distinct release mechanisms, comprising immediate, delayed and prolonged release. Sureteric:Combo-NLC provided a low cytotoxicity profile, along with a ca. 12-fold OL/3-fold SV higher intestinal permeability, compared to those obtained with commercial tablets. Such findings can be ascribed to drug protection and control over release promoted by NLC, supporting them as a versatile platform able to be modified according to the intended needs.",

The decrease mainly concerned hypnotics (-15.5%; -21.2% to -15.3%) and appeared more pronounced in people aged 18-44\u2009years. Incident use of anxiolytics remained stable overall during the period (4.0% of the population). Within anxiolytics, incident use of long half-life benzodiazepines (bromazepam, prazepam) decreased in favor of short half-life benzodiazepines (alprazolam, oxazepam). This change concerned patients aged 65-79 and patients aged 80\u2009years and over.

    "45": "Dual antidepressant combination for treatment-resistant depression is a strategy well supported by literature and accepted in clinical practice. Rather, the usefulness of the combination of more than two antidepressants is controversial. This may be related to the possibility of higher side-effect burden and to doubts about its pharmacological effectiveness and therapeutic advantage compared to other standard treatment options. We report a relapse of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms with insomnia that successfully remitted after the addition of trazodone to a dual combination of paroxetine and mirtazapine (in standard effective doses) in a patient with treatment-resistant depression. We also review the literature and discuss the utility of triple antidepressant combination in treatment-resistant depression. This clinical case highlights the utility of combining trazodone as a third antidepressant for the relapse of depressive symptoms after the failure of a dual antidepressant combination. Trazodone may be advantageous in patients presenting recurrence of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms that include sleep problems and/or insomnia and may be particularly useful when benzodiazepines are not recommended. Although its use may be controversial and associated with higher risk of side-effects, more investigation is needed to determine the efficacy and safety for triple antidepressant combinations as reliable strategies for treatment-resistant depression in clinical practice.", 
    "46": "Despite the many advances in the treatment of hematologic malignancies over the past decade, outcomes in refractory lymphomas remain poor. One potential strategy in this patient population is the specific targeting of IL2R-\u03b1 (CD25), which is overexpressed on many lymphoma and leukemic cells, using antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). ADCT-301 is an ADC composed of human IgG1 HuMax-TAC against CD25, stochastically conjugated through a dipeptide cleavable linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer warhead with a drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2.3. ADCT-301 binds human CD25 with picomolar affinity. ADCT-301 has highly potent and selective cytotoxicity against a panel of CD25-expressing human lymphoma cell lines. Once internalized, the released warhead binds in the DNA minor groove and exerts its potent cytotoxic action via the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links. A strong correlation between loss of viability and DNA cross-link formation is demonstrated. DNA damage persists, resulting in phosphorylation of histone H2AX, cell-cycle arrest in G2-M, and apoptosis. Bystander killing of CD25-negative cells by ADCT-301 is also observed. In vivo, a single dose of ADCT-301 results in dose-dependent and targeted antitumor activity against both subcutaneous and disseminated CD25-positive lymphoma models. In xenografts of Karpas 299, which expressed both CD25 and CD30, marked superiority over brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) is observed. Dose-dependent increases in DNA cross-linking, \u03b3-H2AX, and PBD payload staining were observed in tumors in vivo indicating a role as relevant pharmacodynamic assays.

While other classes of new psychoactive substances such as cannabinoid receptor agonists and designer stimulants are mainly consumed for hedonistic reasons, designer benzodiazepines may also be consumed as 'self-medication' by persons suffering from anxiety or other psychiatric disorders or as stand-by 'antidote' by users of stimulant and hallucinogenic drugs. In the present study, five benzodiazepines (adinazolam, cloniprazepam, fonazepam, 3-hydroxyphenazepam and nitrazolam) and one thienodiazepine (metizolam) offered as 'research chemicals' on the Internet were characterized and their main in vitro phase I metabolites tentatively identified after incubation with pooled human liver microsomes. For all compounds, the structural formula declared by the vendor was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS), liquid chromatography MS/MS and liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight MS analysis. The detected in vitro phase I metabolites of adinazolam were N-desmethyladinazolam and N-didesmethyladinazolam. Metizolam showed a similar metabolism to other thienodiazepines comprising monohydroxylations and dihydroxylation. Cloniprazepam was metabolized to numerous metabolites with the main metabolic steps being N-dealkylation, hydroxylation and reduction of the nitro function. It has to be noted that clonazepam is a metabolite of cloniprazepam, which may lead to difficulties when interpreting analytical findings. Nitrazolam and fonazepam both underwent monohydroxylation and reduction of the nitro function. In the case of 3-OH-phenazepam, no in vitro phase I metabolites were detected. Formation of licensed benzodiazepines (clonazepam after uptake of cloniprazepam) and the sale of metabolites of prescribed benzodiazepines (fonazepam, identical to norflunitrazepam, and 3-hydroxyphenazepam) present the risk of incorrect interpretation of analytical findings.

While helpful in some circumstances, PRN are associated with an increased risk of morbidity, overuse, dependence, and polypharmacy. There is also a dearth of medical literature describing current practices and trends of PRN administration in mental health facilities, especially in Canada, and the literature that does exist is limited by poor documentation practices. Therefore, the primary objective of the current study was to understand the reason (purpose), frequency, use, documentation practices, and outcome (i.e. effectiveness, side-effects) of PRN medication use on inpatient units. Data were pulled to capture a snapshot of PRN administrations over a 3-month period, and included information related to the administration of the PRN medication, such as time of administration, type and dose of PRN medication, and prescribed indication, as well as patient-specific information. Results indicated that approximately 8200 psychotropic PRN medications were administered during the designated 3-month time period, and over 90% of patients received at least one PRN. Most of these were benzodiazepines, followed by antipsychotics. Further analyses were conducted to determine other characteristics of PRN use patterns and to provide a baseline of understanding that will inform future research to investigate the practice of PRN administration to psychiatric inpatients.",

In October 2014, a symptom-based alcohol withdrawal protocol (AWP) using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar) scale was implemented at one institution. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the AWP. Methods: Retrospective chart review was completed, including patients receiving at least one dose of diazepam for alcohol withdrawal pre- and post-protocol. The primary outcome of this study was the average daily and cumulative dose of diazepam during hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included length of stay and occurrence of seizures or delirium tremens. Results: The average daily dose and the average cumulative dose of diazepam were significantly lower in the post-protocol group (5.4 vs 12.1 mg, p < .001; 35.0 vs 77.6 mg, p < .001, respectively). Length of stay was similar between groups (6.5 vs 6.4 days, p = .91), however, duration of benzodiazepine use was decreased in the post-protocol group (2.2 vs 4.7 days, p < .001). Despite using reduced doses of benzodiazepines, there was no increase in adverse events. Conclusions: The implementation of a symptom-based AWP using the CIWA-Ar scale was associated with a reduced average daily and cumulative dose of diazepam without any apparent safety issues.",

Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer-term, quality-controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes.There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects.",

In contrast, the medicinal drugs such as benzodiazepines and opiates (morphine) were predominantly detected at concentrations below the new per se limit. Given its medical applications, amphetamines appear to have been grouped with the medicinal type drugs, with our data showing that 25.2% of the amphetamine positive samples would exceed the new specified limit. These data show that samples containing medicinal and prescription drugs are likely to be detected below the new legal limits, while illicit drugs were typically found at concentrations above the new specified limits.",

Co-administration of netazepide 5\u00a0mg abolishes the effect of esomeprazole-induced hypergastrinaemia on ECL cells. The quick return to baseline of gastrin and CgA and absence of dyspepsia after esomeprazole withdrawal do not support the concept of rebound hyperacidity.", 
    "138": "A novel pretreatment method, which was performed using a two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography (2D-HPLC) system, was proposed for the direct analysis of drugs in human serum. A temperature-responsive column was used as a pretreatment column. The stationary phase of the temperature-responsive column exhibits temperature-regulated hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics. Controlling the ionic strength of the eluent enables human serum albumin (HSA) to pass through the column without retention. When serum samples containing barbiturates or benzodiazepines were injected into the temperature-responsive column using 10\u00a0mM of ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) as the mobile phase and in the temperature range of 10-40\u00a0\u00b0C, HSA was eluted from the column near the dead time, followed by the individual drugs. When the column temperature was changed, the retention times of the drugs were altered owing to surface property changes within the pretreatment column. These closely eluted compounds were subsequently introduced into the analytical column using a column-switching valve, with a minimal gap time to avoid foreign substance contamination. This new 2D-HPLC method afforded high-quality chromatograms of multiple drugs without unwanted peaks from foreign substances. The present technique could be an attractive choice in selecting the analytical method for drug analysis.",

Although these patients also had short hospital lengths of stay, there was no clear relationship between level of agitation and length of stay across all patient groups. One possible explanation for patients with bipolar disorder experiencing short lengths of stay is that their source of agitation may be more closely related to a complex effect of cannabis use rather than a sole etiology of mental illness.

    "158": "Dystonia is a movement disorder, characterized by involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movements and/or postures. Antidystonic effects of benzodiazepines in patients with different types of dystonia could be replicated in the dt(sz) mutant hamster, a phenotypic model of paroxysmal dystonia. Compounds with preferred binding at specific subunits of the gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor may provide a more beneficial spectrum of effects in comparison with benzodiazepines. We therefore examined the effects of the \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32 GABAA receptor preferring compound zolpidem (2.0-10.0mg/kg i.p.) and of the \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32 GABAA receptor preferring compound NS11394 (3.0-30mg/kg i.p.) on the severity of dystonia in the dt(sz) mutant in comparison with the benzodiazepine clonazepam (0.5-1.0mg/kg i.p.). As expected, clonazepam exerted pronounced antidystonic effects. While zolpidem showed moderate beneficial effects, NS11394 significantly increased the severity of dystonia. The present results indicate for the first time that positive GABAA receptor modulators show contrary effects on dystonia dependent on their preference for alpha-subunits. The potential link between alterations in GABAA receptor subunits and GABAergic disinhibition in dystonia deserves further attention in research on the pathophysiology and therapeutic targets.",

By approximation of the electrophysiological responses which the estimated free rat brain concentrations can induce, we demonstrated that convenient systemic administration of MP-III-022 in the dose range 1-10mg/kg may result in a selective potentiation, over a wide range from mild to moderate to strong, of \u03b15\u03b2\u03b32 GABAA receptors. For eliciting a comparable range of potentiation, the widely studied parent ligand SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 containing an ester moiety needs to be administered over a much wider dose range (10-200mg/kg), but at the price of activating non-\u03b15 GABAARs as well as the desired \u03b15GABAARs at the highest dose. At the dose of 10mg/kg, which elicits a strong positive modulation of \u03b15GABAARs, MP-III-022 caused mild, but significant muscle relaxation, while at doses 1-10mg/kg was devoid of ataxia, sedation or an influence on the anxiety level, characteristic for non-selective benzodiazepines. As an amide compound with improved stability and kinetic properties, MP-III-022 may represent an optimized tool to study the influence of \u03b15GABAARs on the neuronal pathways related to CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome or autism.",

Beside, cromakalim (0.1mg/kg) could reverse the antidepressant-like effect of nitrazepam (0.5mg/kg) in both FST and TST, while cromakalim and glibenclamide alone could not change the immobility time compared to control group (P>0.05). The hole-board test revealed that nitrazepam at doses of 0.5 and 0.1mg/kg could increase the activity of the animal's head-dipping and boost the curiosity and exploration behavior of mice. The results of this study revealed that nitrazepam may possess antidepressant-like properties and this effect is dependent to potassium channels in both FST and TST.",

The present study was aimed to tests the anticonvulsant properties of the aqueous extract and the alkaloid fraction of the stem barks of Feretia apodanthera. The anticonvulsant investigation was carried out against bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, pentylenetetrazol-, Methyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxylate-, N-Methyl-D-aspartate-, 4-aminopyridine-, and maximal electroshock-induced seizures or turning behavior in mice. The aqueous extract protected mice against bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, pentylenetetrazol-, Methyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxylate-, N-methyl-D-aspartate -, 4-aminopyridine- and maximal electroshock-induced seizures or turning behavior. Also, N-Methyl-D-aspartate-, 4-aminopyridine- and maximal electroshock- induced seizures or turning behavior, were significantly antagonized by the alkaloid fraction (80mg/kg) from Feretia apodanthera. The total protection of mice provided by the aqueous extract against convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazol or picrotoxin was anagonized by flumazenil, a specific antagonist of the benzodiazepine site in the GABAA receptor complex. The aqueous extract of Feretia apodanthera (but not the alkaloid fraction) increased the brain GABA content and inhibited the GABA transaminase activity. In conclusion, Feretia apodanthera was revealed possessing anticonvulsant effects in mice, likely via the GABAergic neurotransmission.",

Here, we compared the effects of cannabinoid-related compounds to those of alprazolam, a clinically effective panicolytic, on the duration of the escape reaction induced by intravenous infusion of KCN (80\u03bcg) in rats. Alprazolam (1, 2, 4mg/kg) decreased escape duration at doses that did not alter basal locomotor activity.

The pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine acetamides, exemplified by DPA-713 and DPA-714, are a class of high affinity TSPO ligands with selectivity over the central benzodiazepine receptor. In this study we have explored the potential anti-glioblastoma activity of a library of DPA-713 and DPA-714 analogues, and investigated the effect of amending the alkyl ether chain on TSPO affinity and functional potential. All ligands demonstrated nanomolar affinity for TSPO, but showed diverse functional activity, for example DPA-713 and DPA-714 did not affect the proliferation or viability of human T98G glioblastoma cells, while the hexyl ether and benzyl ether derivatives decreased proliferation of T98G cells without affecting proliferation in human fetal glial SVGp12 cells. These ligands also induced apoptosis and dissipated T98G mitochondrial membrane potential. This suggests that the nature of the alkyl ether chain of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine acetamides has little influence on TSPO affinity but is important for functional activity of this class of TSPO ligands.",

The children's behavior in the follow-up sessions was assessed using the Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale (OSUBRS); higher scores represented less cooperative behavior (range 5-20). Follow-up assessments were conducted on 50 children under four years old for up to 29 months. Data were analyzed by the Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and Cox regression model. OSUBRS mean (standard deviation) scores for the whole sample decreased from 11.9 (5.4) before treatment to 6.8 (3.2) at the final recall session (p < 0.001). Moderate sedation with midazolam (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.2-6.9) or midazolam/ketamine (OR 4.3, 95%CI 1.6-11.4) improved children's future behavior. The general anesthesia group (n = 4) had a small sample size and the results should be considered with caution.

Recruited patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: in Group A, they received 0.5 mg of alprazolam orally one hour before the procedure; and in Group C, they received placebo. Anesthesia technique was identical in both groups. Patients were monitored during the first two postoperative hours to establish their AHI (apnea hypopnea index, the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour). Nine patients were excluded (4 in group A and 5 in group C) due to technical problems or refusal. Interestingly, premedication by alprazolam did not change intra-operative propofol requirements.

These apneas did not induce significant arterial oxygen desaturation, or mandibular instability. Our study demonstrates that a premedication with 0.5 mg of alprazolam doesn't modify intra-operative anesthetic requirements during colonoscopy, but is associated with a higher rate of obstructive apneas during at least three and a half hours after ingestion.

Herein we report the effects of several Retro-1 analogues on both toxins and oligonucleotides.

    "190": "Low to moderate perinatal ethanol exposure (PEE) may have disastrous consequences for the central nervous system resulting notably in permanent cognitive deficits. Learning and memory are mediated in the hippocampus by long-term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD), two forms of synaptic plasticity. PEE decreases LTP but also abnormally facilitates LTD (Kervern et al. ) through a presently unknown mechanism. We studied in rat hippocampus slice, the involvement of the chloride co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2, in the role of GABAA inhibitions in facilitated LTD after moderate PEE. After PEE and in contrast to control slices, facilitated LTD in CA1 field was reduced by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline with no changes in sensitivity to bicuculline and in GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites. Also, sensitivity to diazepam was unaltered, whereas aberrant LTD was blocked. Immunohistochemistry and protein analysis demonstrated an increase in KCC2 protein level at cell membrane in CA1 after PEE with no change in NKCC1 expression. Specifically, both monomeric and dimeric forms of KCC2 were increased in CA1. Bumetanide (10-100\u2009\u03bcM), a dose-dependent blocker of NKCC1 and KCC2, or VU0240551 (10\u2009\u03bcM) a specific antagonist of KCC2, corrected the enhanced LTD and interestingly bumetanide also restored the lower LTP after PEE. These results demonstrate for the first time an upregulation of the KCC2 co-transporter expression after moderate PEE associated with disturbances in GABAergic neurotransmission modulating bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Importantly, bumetanide compensated deficits in both LTP and LTD, revealing its potential therapeutic properties.",

In the present study, the authors investigated the uptake and tissue distribution of the benzodiazepine oxazepam in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) after 28\u2009d of waterborne exposure to 0.8\u2009\u03bcg\u2009L(-1) , 4.7\u2009\u03bcg\u2009L(-1) , and 30.6\u2009\u03bcg\u2009L(-1) . Successively, they explored the relationship between the internal concentrations of oxazepam and the effects on fish exploratory behavior quantified by performing 2 types of behavioral tests, the novel tank diving test and the shelter-seeking test. The highest internal concentrations of oxazepam were found in brain, followed by plasma and liver, whereas muscle presented the lowest values. Average concentrations measured in the plasma of fish from the 3 exposure groups were, respectively, 8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\u2009\u03bcg\u2009L(-1) , 30.3\u2009\u00b1\u200916.1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009L(-1) , and 98.8\u2009\u00b1\u200972.9\u2009\u03bcg\u2009L(-1) . Significant correlations between plasma and tissue concentrations of oxazepam were found in all 3 groups. Exposure of fish to 30.6\u2009\u00b5g L(-1) in water produced plasma concentrations within or just below the human therapeutic plasma concentration (HT PC) range in many individuals. Statistically significant behavioral effects in the novel tank diving test were observed in fish exposed to 4.7\u2009\u03bcg\u2009L(-1) . In this group, plasma concentrations of oxazepam were approximately one-third of the lowest HT PC value. No significant effects were observed in fish exposed to the lowest and highest concentrations. The significance of these results is discussed in the context of the species-specific behavior of fathead minnow and existing knowledge of oxazepam pharmacology.

    "209": "Defining a method development methodology for achiral drug impurity profiling in SFC requires a number of steps. Initially, diverse stationary phases are characterized and a small number of orthogonal or dissimilar phases are selected for further method development. In this paper, we focus on a next step which is the investigation of the modifier composition on chromatographic selectivity. A solvent-triangle based approach is used in which blends of organic solvents, mainly ethanol (EtOH), propanol (PrOH), acetonitrile (ACN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixed with methanol (MeOH) are tested as modifiers on six dissimilar stationary phases. The tested modifier blends were composed to have equal eluotropic strengths as calculated on bare silica. The modifier leads to minor changes in terms of elution order, retention and mixture resolution. However, varying only the modifier composition on a given stationary phase does not lead to the creation of dissimilar systems. Therefore the modifier composition is an optimization parameter, with the stationary phase being the factor determining most the selectivity of a given mixture in achiral SFC.",

The benzodiazepine ligand was reacted with zinc(ii), cadmium(ii) and mercury(ii) chloride, bromide and iodide to give complexes with general formula [M(DLMBZD)X2]. The complexes have been synthesized and characterized by IR, NMR and elemental analysis. The structure of seven complexes has been obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In all the cases, the metal is (2 + 2 + 1)-five-coordinated by two halide ligands, two nitrogen atoms from pyrazine and diazepine rings and a carbonyl oxygen from a pteridine ring. The coordinated-metal environment is a square-based pyramid, with increasing trigonality from Hg(ii) to Zn(ii) complexes. To coordinate the metals, the ligand folds itself, establishing four intramolecular \u03c3-\u03c0 interactions with the pyrimidine and pyrazine rings. A topological analysis of the electron density using the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules and the complexes stability has been performed.",

    "215": "Aim: In this manuscript, we report data on the association between executive functions screened by Frontal Assessment Battery, Five Digit Test and Digit Span with self-reported depressive symptoms and sleep complaints in non-demented older adults. Methods: A total sample of 95 non-demented older adults performed Geriatric Depression Scale short version, Frontal Assessment Battery, Five Digit Test, Digit Span, and clinical interview. We split participants in groups stratified by age according to: young-old (60-69 years of age), old-old (70-79 years), and oldest-old (>80 years) and compared these three groups on the sociodemographic characteristics and executive functions performance. We carried out Poisson regression with robust error variance to verify sleep complaints and depression effects on executive functions performance. Gender, age, years of formal education, use of antidepressants and of benzodiazepines were considered as confounding variables, taking into account executive functions as dependent and sleep complaints and depression as independent variables. Results: Controlling the effect of age, gender, years of formal education, use of benzodiazepines and of antidepressants there was a significant influence of depression in motor programming, inhibitory control, and working memory. Individuals without depression show motor programming scores 68.4% higher, inhibitory control scores 3 times greater and working memory scores also 3 times greater than individuals without depression. There was a significant influence of sleep complaints in phonemic fluency, motor programming, inhibitory control, and working memory. Individuals without sleep complaints show phonemic fluency scores 2 times greater than, motor programming scores 85.9% higher, inhibitory control scores 3 times greater and working memory scores also 3 times greater than individuals without sleep complaints. Conclusions: Sleep complaints are associated with phonemic fluency, motor programming, inhibitory control, and working memory impairment. Depression symptoms presence are associated with motor programming and working memory performances. Depression and sleep complaints interaction would determine worse phonemic fluency, inhibitory control and working memory cognitive performance than these two conditions alone.",

Method: Participants (n = 27) with ICD-10 diagnoses of F20 (schizophrenia), F25 (schizoaffective disorders), F31 (bipolar affective disorder), F32 (depressive episode), and F60 (specific personality disorders) were randomized to receive group music therapy plus standard care (48 weekly sessions of 2 h) or standard care only. The clinical measures included dosages of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants. Results: The participants who received group music therapy demonstrated greater improvement in drug dosage with respect to neuroleptics than those who did not receive group music therapy. Antidepressants had an increment for both groups that was significant only for the control group. Benzodiazepines and mood stabilizers did not show any significant change in either group. Conclusion: Group music therapy combined with standard drug care was effective for controlling neuroleptic drug dosages in adult psychiatric outpatients who received group music therapy. We discussed the likely applications of group music therapy in psychiatry and the possible contribution of music therapy in improving the psychopathological condition of adult outpatients. In addition, the implications for the patient-centered perspective were also discussed.", 
    "217": "In humans, associations between anxiety and nausea (including motion-induced) are reported but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Hypothermia is proposed to be an index of nausea in rats. Utilising hypothermia and heart rate as outcome measures we investigated the response to provocative motion in rats selectively bred for high (HAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-related behaviors and in non-selected (NAB) rats to further elucidate the potential relationship between hypothermia and nausea-like state. Core temperature and electrocardiogram were monitored in each group (n=10 per group) using telemetry, with or without circular motion (40min; 0.75Hz) and vehicle or diazepam (2mg/kg, i.p.) pre-treatment. Heart rate and time- and frequency-domain parameters of heart rate variability were derived from the electrocardiogram. There was no baseline difference in core temperature between the three groups (mean 38.0\u00b10.1\u00b0C), but HAB animals had a significantly lower resting heart rate (330\u00b17bpm) compared to LAB (402\u00b15bpm) and NAB (401\u00b19bpm). Animals in all groups exhibited hypothermia during motion (HAB: 36.3\u00b10.1\u00b0C; NAB: 36.4\u00b10.1\u00b0C; LAB: 34.9\u00b10.2\u00b0C) with the magnitude (area under the curve, AUC) of the response during 40-min motion being greater in LAB compared to NAB and HAB rats, and this was also the case for the motion-induced bradycardia. Diazepam had minimal effects on baseline temperature and heart rate in all groups, but significantly reduced the hypothermia response (AUC) to motion in all groups by ~30%. Breeding for extremes in anxiety-related behavior unexpectedly selects animals with low trait anxiety that have enhanced bradycardia and hypothermic responses to motion; consequently, this animal model appears to be not suitable for exploring relationships between anxiety and autonomic correlates of nausea. Thermal and cardiovascular responses to motion were little different between HAB and NAB rats indicating that either hypothermia is not an index of a nausea-like state in rats, or that the positive correlation between anxiety and nausea demonstrated in humans does not exist in rats. The mechanism underlying the enhanced physiological responses in LAB requires more detailed study and may provide a novel model to investigate factors modulating motion sensitivity.",

    "219": "We analyzed RSE episodes treated in our institution between 2001 and 2012. Successful treatment with CLB was scored if CLB was the last AED added to therapy before RSE termination. We assessed the differences between patients with and without CLB and correlated CLB with outcome. Among patients treated with CLB, we studied responders and non-responders and compared our CLB cohort with recently published data.", 
    "220": "CLB was part of the AED regimen in 24/70 (34.3\u00a0%) RSE episodes. In six of these (25.0\u00a0%) RSE resolution was attributed to CLB. Baseline characteristics of episodes with and without CLB treatment showed no significant differences and RSE termination rates were very similar (83.3\u00a0% vs. 80.4\u00a0%). CLB was administered in clinically more complex RSE with longer RSE duration and worse outcome, but CLB was not related independently to outcome. Comparison of our results with previously published data revealed that baseline characteristics as well as CLB maintenance doses and time of treatment initiation were similar in both cohorts. CLB was less frequently the last AED added to RSE therapy in our patients indicating a lower treatment success rate than previously reported.", 
    "221": "CLB represents a reasonable AED and promising add-on agent for treatment of RSE. However, rates of successful CLB response were substantially lower than in a recently published study. Differing RSE characteristics and treatment strategies may account for the discrepancy between study results, as RSE etiologies and seizures types associated with unfavorable prognosis were more common in our cohort, while anesthetics tended to be less frequently applied to achieve seizure control.", 
    "222": "A substantial number of mutations have been identified in voltage-gated sodium channel genes that result in various forms of human epilepsy. SCN1A mutations result in a spectrum of severity ranging from mild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome, an infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Dravet syndrome patients experience multiple seizures types that are often refractory to treatment, developmental delays, and elevated risk for SUDEP. The same sodium channel mutation can produce epilepsy phenotypes of varying clinical severity. This suggests that other factors, including genetic, modify the primary mutation and change disease severity. Mouse models provide a useful tool in studying the genetic basis of epilepsy. The mouse strain background can alter phenotype severity, supporting a contribution of genetic modifiers in epilepsy. The Scn1a+/- mouse model has a strain-dependent epilepsy phenotype. Scn1a+/- mice on the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) strain have a normal phenotype and lifespan, while [129xC57BL/6J]F1-Scn1a+/- mice experience spontaneous seizures, hyperthermia-induced seizures and high rates of premature death. We hypothesize the phenotypic differences are due to strain-specific genetic modifiers that influence expressivity of the Scn1a+/- phenotype. Low resolution mapping of Scn1a+/- identified several Dravet syndrome modifier (Dsm) loci responsible for the strain-dependent difference in survival. One locus of interest, Dsm1 located on chromosome 5, was fine mapped to a 9 Mb region using interval specific congenics. RNA-Seq was then utilized to identify candidate modifier genes within this narrowed region. Three genes with significant total gene expression differences between 129S6/SvEvTac and [129xC57BL/6J]F1 were identified, including the GABAA receptor subunit, Gabra2. Further analysis of Gabra2 demonstrated allele-specific expression. Pharmological manipulation by clobazam, a common anticonvulsant with preferential affinity for the GABRA2 receptor, revealed dose-dependent protection against hyperthermia-induced seizures in Scn1a+/- mice. These findings support Gabra2 as a genetic modifier of the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome.", 
    "223": "Perampanel is an antiepileptic drug that is used to treat partial-onset seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is a highly selective AMPA receptor allosteric antagonist. However, published data on perampanel activity vary in different studies. In the present work we studied the inhibition of native calcium-permeable and calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors in rat brain neurons by perampanel using whole-cell patch clamp technique. We found that inhibitory activity and kinetics of perampanel action do not differ between calcium-permeable AMPA receptors of rat giant striatum interneurons and calcium-impermeable receptors of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (the IC50 value about 60nM). Also, perampanel caused the same inhibition of steady-state currents induced by kainate and glutamate. From the other side perampanel-induced inhibition was markedly reduced in the presence of cyclothiazide (IC50 value increased to 1.2\u00b10.2\u03bcM). We demonstrated that perampanel competes with GYKI-52466 for binding site.", 
    "224": "The effects of anesthesia on the functional auditory characteristics of cortical neurons, such as spatial and temporal response properties, vary between an anesthetized and an awake subject. However, studies have shown that an appropriate anesthetic method that approaches the awake condition is still useful because of its greater stability and controllability. The present study compared neural response properties from two core fields of the mouse auditory cortex under three anesthetic conditions: urethane; ketamine and xylazine hydrochloride (KX) mixture; and a combination of medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol (MMB). To measure sound stimulation in vivo, we recorded flavoprotein-autofluorescent images of endogenous green fluorescence. Under all conditions, fluorescence changes in auditory core subfields in response to tones were observed, and response properties, such as peak intensity, latency, duration, and activated areas were analyzed. Results showed larger response peak intensity, latency, and duration in the core subfields under urethane compared with KX and MMB, with no significant differences between KX and MMB. Conversely, under KX anesthesia the activated areas showed characteristic response properties in a subfield-dependent manner. These results demonstrated the varied effects of anesthesia on response properties in the core subfields of the auditory cortex.",

Mutants harboring the Q241M point substitution in Gabra2 showed blunted chronic intake in the CA and IA protocols. S270H/L277A mutants consumed excessive amounts of alcohol but, unlike wild-types, they did not show forced abstinence-induced social deficits.", 
    "257": "These findings suggest a role for: (i) H101 in species-typical binge-like drinking, (ii) Q241 in escalated chronic drinking, and (iii) S270 and/or L277 in the development of forced abstinence-associated social deficits. Clinical findings report reduced BZD-binding sites in the cortex of dependent patients; the present findings suggest a specific role for BZD-sensitive \u03b12-containing receptors. In addition, amino acid residue 241 in Gabra2 is necessary for positive modulation and activation of GABAA receptors by ALLO and THDOC; we postulate that neurosteroid action on \u03b12-containing receptor may be necessary for escalated chronic EtOH intake.", 
    "258": "Lorazepam is used as premedication for its anxiolytic properties. The UGT2B15 genotype is of importance for the metabolism of lorazepam. The clinical effect of genetic polymorphisms in UGT2B15 genotype on the treatment of anxiety levels in same-day surgery patients receiving lorazepam, however, is unknown.", 
    "259": "Three hundred ninety-eight same-day surgery patients of mixed sex (from a previous double-blinded randomized controlled trial who were assigned to either lorazepam [n = 198] or placebo [n = 200]) were assessed for the UGT2B15*2 variant allele. Anxiety was measured preoperatively and postoperatively by the State part of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The difference between these 2 measurements served as outcome of the study. Analysis of variance was used to assess the State part of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory difference for interactions among the following factors: UGT2B15 genotype status, treatment condition (lorazepam or placebo), patient sex, and preoperative anxiety score.", 
    "260": "The anxiety difference was complex in that the interaction of lorazepam and UGT2B15 genotype status also was dependent on the joint effect of patient sex and preoperative anxiety score (F = 7.15, P = .008). Further exploration showed clinical relevant results in patients with high preoperative anxiety scores. Striking was that females with high preoperative anxiety scores and genetically reduced lorazepam glucuronidation (UGT2B15*2 homozygotes) showed more postoperative anxiety reduction than males with the same genotype.", 
    "261": "UGT2B15 genotype contributes to postoperative anxiety reduction after lorazepam premedication. Future research that focuses on patients with high preoperative anxiety scores could help to gain a deeper understanding in the clinical relevance of the interaction between lorazepam and UGT2B15 genotype on postoperative anxiety levels.", 
    "262": "The translocator protein (TSPO) is an emerging target in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Up-regulated TSPO in the central nervous system (CNS) appears to be involved in neuroinflammatory processes; therefore, the development of potent TSPO ligands is a promising method for alleviating or imaging patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Areas covered: This review will provide an overview of recently developed TSPO ligands patented from 2010 to 2015. Part 1 will present a summary focusing on TSPO ligands other than indole-based or cholesterol-like compounds, which will be discussed in part 2. Part 1 covers diverse benzodiazepine-derived analogues such as isoquinoline carboxamides and aryloxyanilides. Moreover, bicyclic ring structures such as imidazopyridine, pyrazolopyrimidine, and phenylpurine will be highlighted as promising scaffolds for TSPO ligands. A brief analysis of currently reported TSPO structures will also be covered in part 1. Expert opinion: Although the underlying pharmacological mechanism of TSPO remains to be elucidated, several TSPO ligands have shown therapeutic efficacy in experimental animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, radioactive TSPO ligands have been extensively studied for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative processes. Thus, further studies on both the basic and applied mechanisms of TSPO are warranted in the pursuit of successful pharmacological applications of TSPO ligands.", 
    "263": "Weight gain was reported during methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). However, its relation to eating habits and specific risk factors, including methadone dose or serum level, was limited. The aims of this study were to characterize risk factors for weight gain and to study current eating habits, food preferences, and nutrition knowledge.", 
    "264": "Patients with available measures of weight and height (body mass index [BMI]) at admission to MMT and at follow-up, when methadone serum levels were determined (after 1 year or when stabilized) (N = 114), were studied (using the Addiction Severity Index [ASI], drugs in urine, methadone doses, and serum levels). In addition, 109 current patients with available earlier (5.8 \u00b1 2.6\u00a0years earlier) BMI completed eating behavior rating and nutrition knowledge questionnaires, and their current and earlier BMI were compared.", 
    "265": "The BMI of 114 newly admitted patients increased from 22.5 \u00b1 3.8 to 24.4 \u00b1 4.3 (P < .0005). Once stabilized on methadone, BMI increased further (24.3 \u00b1 4.5 to 25.6 \u00b1 5.0; P < .0005; n = 74), with no change in methadone doses (125.6 \u00b1 32.5 to 128.0 \u00b1 34.1; F = 1.4, P = .2) or serum levels (495.6 \u00b1 263.7 to 539.8 \u00b1 306.2; F = 1.3, P = .2). Repeated-measures analyses revealed that BMI elevation was higher among 45 hepatitis C virus seronegative and 46 non-benzodiazepine-abusing on-admission patients. Those who scored lower on knowledge about healthy diet and showed a higher sweet-foods preference had a higher BMI.", 
    "266": "BMI increased over time, but independent of methadone dosage and blood levels. As expected, worse diet habits and a desire for sweet foods are related to higher BMI. Paradoxically, healthier status (i.e., hepatitis C seronegative, no benzodiazepine abuse) at admission is predictive of greater weight gain during MMT. Education about nutrition habits is recommended.", 
    "267": "Benzodiazepine use has been associated with addiction-related risks, but little is known about its association with aberrant drug-related behaviors in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain. The authors examined the association between receipt of a benzodiazepine prescription and 2 aberrant drug-related behaviors, early opioid refills and illicit drug (cocaine) use in patients receiving opioids for noncancer chronic pain.", 
    "268": "This was a retrospective cohort study of 847 patients with \u22651 visit to either a hospital-based primary care clinic or one of two community health centers between September 1, 2011, and August 31, 2012. All patients received \u22653 opioid prescriptions written at least 21\u00a0days apart within 6 months, and \u22651 urine drug screen during the study period. A Cox proportional hazards model estimated the hazard of a second early opioid refill, defined as an opioid prescription written 7-25\u00a0days after the previous prescription for the same drug, as a function of time-varying benzodiazepine prescription. A logistic regression model examined the relationship between benzodiazepine prescription and a positive urine test for cocaine. Models were adjusted for demographics and mental/substance use disorder diagnoses.", 
    "269": "Twenty-three percent (n = 196) of patients received \u22651 benzodiazepine prescription during the study period. Twenty-two percent (n = 183) of patients had \u22652 early opioid refills, and 11% (n = 93) had \u22651 positive urine drug tests for cocaine. Receipt of benzodiazepine prescription was associated with an increased hazard of having a second early opioid refill, adjusted hazard ratio = 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-2.18), but not associated with a positive cocaine test, adjusted odds ratio = 1.07 (95% CI: 0.55-2.23).", 
    "270": "Among primary care patients receiving chronic opioid therapy, benzodiazepine prescription was associated with early opioid refills but not with cocaine use. Further research should better elucidate the risks and benefits of prescribing benzodiazepines to patients receiving opioids for chronic pain."
