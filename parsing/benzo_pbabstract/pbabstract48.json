Although higher brain function can be restored and even improved in some patients after tumor resection, the mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated changes in the brains of patients after resection of an intracranial meningioma using (123)I-Iomazenil (IMZ)-single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Ten patients underwent IMZ-SPECT within 4 weeks before and 3 months after intracranial meningioma resection. Changes in IMZ accumulation in brain parenchyma were assessed as ratios of counts in the lesion-to-contralateral hemisphere (L/C ratios). Mean Mini-Mental State Examination scores before and after resection of 19.9\u00b111.4 vs. 26.5\u00b13.8, respectively (p=0.03) indicated that the cognitive function of these patients was significantly improved after tumor resection. The average L/C ratios calculated from image counts of IMZ were 0.92\u00b10.05 and 0.98\u00b10.02 before and after surgery, respectively. The L/C ratio of IMZ accumulation was significantly decreased after tumor resection (p=0.0003). In contrast, regional cerebral blood flow calculated from (123)I-Iodoamphetamine-SPECT images did not significantly differ after tumor resection. The recovered binding potential of IMZ in brain parenchyma surrounding the tumor bulk after resection indicates that the viability of central benzodiazepine receptors was reversibly depressed and recoverable after release from compression by the tumor. The recovered neuronal viability revealed by IMZ-SPECT might be responsible for the improved cognitive function after intracranial meningioma resection.",

    "9": "Many organophosphorous esters synthesized for applications in industry, agriculture, or warfare irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase, and acute poisoning with these compounds causes life-threatening cholinergic overstimulation. Following classical emergency treatment with atropine, an oxime, and a benzodiazepine, surviving victims often suffer brain neurodegeneration. Currently, there is no pharmacological treatment to prevent this brain injury. Here we show that a cyclic diterpenoid, (1S,2E,4R,6R,7E,11E)-cembra-2,7,11-triene-4,6-diol (4R) ameliorates the damage caused by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) in the hippocampal area CA1. DFP has been frequently used as a surrogate for the warfare nerve agent sarin. In rats, DFP is lethal at the dose used to cause brain damage. Therefore, to observe brain damage in survivors, the death rate was reduced by pre-administration of the peripherally acting antidotes pyridostigmine and methyl atropine or its analog ipratropium. Pyridostigmine bromide, methyl atropine nitrate, and ipratropium bromide were dissolved in saline and injected intramuscularly at 0.1mg/kg, 20mg/kg, and 23mg/kg, respectively. DFP (9mg/kg) dissolved in cold water was injected intraperitoneally. 4R (6mg/kg) dissolved in DMSO was injected subcutaneously, either 1h before or 5 or 24h after DFP. Neurodegeneration was assessed with Fluoro-Jade B and amino cupric silver staining; neuroinflammation was measured by the expression of nestin, a marker of activated astrocytes. Forty-eight hours after DFP administration, 4R decreased the number of dead neurons by half when injected before or after DFP. 4R also significantly decreased the number of activated astrocytes. These data suggest that 4R is a promising new drug that could change the therapeutic paradigm for acute poisoning with organophosphorous compounds by the implementation of a second-stage intervention after the classical countermeasure treatment.",

We wanted to address the in vivo relevance of those substances in the Tg2576 Alzheimer's mouse model. Tg7526 mice were anesthesia-sedated for 90\u00a0min once a week for 4\u00a0weeks. Y maze, Congo Red, and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) immunochemistry were performed. We did not find any significant change in the navigation behavior of the exposed mice compared to the controls. Significantly less deposition of A\u03b2 in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice exposed to isoflurane, propofol, diazepam, ketamine, and pentobarbital was observed. In the dentate gyrus, A\u03b2 deposition was significantly greater in the group treated with pentobarbital. Congo Red staining evidenced significantly fewer fibrils in the cortex of mice exposed to diazepam, ketamine, or pentobarbital. The adopted repetitive exposure did not cause a significant detriment in Tg7526 mouse.", 
    "11": "Little is published about newborn drug testing in multiple gestations. The objective of this study was to review the results of meconium drug screening in multiple births to compare drug(s) and/or drug metabolite(s) detected. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from a national reference laboratory and an academic medical center. The data were de-identified for the reference laboratory dataset. For the academic center data, a detailed chart review of the newborn and mother's medical record was performed on cases for which one or more drug(s) and/or metabolites(s) were identified and confirmed in meconium. Meconium was analyzed for amphetamine, methamphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoid metabolites, cocaine metabolites, methadone, opiates, oxycodone, phencyclidine and propoxyphene. One hundred and forty-two of 1,084 sets of twins and 2 of 20 sets of triplets had mismatched results. The incidence of mismatched results among the individual drug or drug classes tested was 0.9% (208 of 23,848 total results). For the panel of drug testing performed, mismatches were seen in 13% (142 of 1,084) sets of twins and 10% (2 of 20) sets of triplets. Barbiturates (33%), opiates (30%) and benzodiazepines (28%) were the most common mismatches in the national reference laboratory dataset. Benzodiazepines (89%) and opiates (51%) were most common in the academic medical center dataset with most explained by iatrogenic medications administered to one infant but not the other. Mismatches for cannabinoids most often occurred when tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites were present at a low concentration (near lower reporting limit) in one infant but not the other. Mismatched results of meconium drug testing in multiples not explainable by differences in prescribed medications are uncommon and most often occur when an analyte is barely above reporting cutoff in only one infant. Administration of iatrogenic medications to one infant but not the other(s) is another frequent cause of such mismatches.",

Here, we demonstrate that after exposure to stress, crayfish sustainably avoided the aversive illuminated arms of an aquatic plus-maze. This behavior was correlated with an increase in brain serotonin and was abolished by the injection of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide. Serotonin injection into unstressed crayfish induced avoidance; again, this effect was reversed by injection with chlordiazepoxide. Our results demonstrate that crayfish exhibit a form of anxiety similar to that described in vertebrates, suggesting the conservation of several underlying mechanisms during evolution. Analyses of this ancestral behavior in a simple model reveal a new route to understanding anxiety and may alter our conceptions of the emotional status of invertebrates.",

Different SPE cartridges were considered: hydrophilic modified reversed-phase (Oasis HLB) and their modified versions containing also a cationic-exchange group (Oasis MCX) or anionic-exchange (Oasis MAX) funcionalities. Stability of analytes and the impact of the final eluate volume on the matrix effects on LC-MS/MS were also considered. In the final method, 100-200 mL of sample are extracted with Oasis MCX (60 mg), eluted with 5 mL of methanol (1.25% NH3) and the eluate concentrated and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Under these conditions, LOQs were established between 0.1 and 18 ng L(-1) for influent wastewater. The use of surrogated deuterated internal standards allows obtaining recoveries in the 84-122% range. Finally the method was applied to determinate the analytes in wastewater and surface water and 10 compounds were detected in the range of 0.5-170 ng L(-1), being the ritalinic acid (the main metabolite of methylphenidate) the analyte detected in the highest concentrations.",

There are evidences indicating that the other new compounds inositol, duloxetine, mirtazapine, milnacipran, and nefazodone have antipanic properties and may be effective compounds in the treatment of PD. The effectiveness of reboxetine and anticonvulsants is a subject of controversy. In addition to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines and atypical antipsychotics may be valid alternatives in the treatment of PD.

Animal models such as barbiturate sleep-induction, light-dark box, elevated plus maze, forced swimming test, tail suspension test and open field test were conducted. Male Albino Swiss mice were treated orally with vehicle 10 mL/kg, fluoxetine 20 mg/kg, imipramine 15 mg/kg, diazepam 1 mg/kg or oleanolic acid 5-40 mg/kg. Pretreatment (intraperitoneal) of animals with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 20 mg/kg, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4- (2-phthalimido) butyl]piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190) 0.5 mg/kg, p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA) 100 mg/kg or \u03b1-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) 100 mg/kg, WAY100635 (WAY) 0.3 mg/kg, prazosin (PRAZ) 1 mg/kg, yohimbine 2 mg/kg as well as monoamine oxidase assay and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) quantification were carried out. Oleanolic acid potentiated the hypnotic effect of barbiturate and demonstrated an anxiolytic effect in both the light-dark box and elevated plus maze. This effect was not reversed by PTZ. Acute and/or chronic oral treatment of mice with oleanolic acid (5-20 mg/kg) elicited an antidepressant effect in the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test without interfering with the locomotor activity. The antidepressant effect of oleanolic acid was attenuated by NAN-190, AMPT, PCPA, WAY and PRAZ. Although monoamine oxidase activity remained unaltered by oleanolic acid, chronic administration of oleanolic acid augmented hippocampal BDNF level.

    "37": "Cochlear implants are currently the most effective solution for profound sensorineural hearing loss, and vestibular prostheses are under development to treat bilateral vestibulopathies. Electrical current spread in these neuroprostheses limits channel independence and, in some cases, may impair their performance. In comparison, optical stimuli that are spatially confined may result in a significant functional improvement. Pulsed infrared radiation (IR) has previously been shown to elicit responses in neurons. This study analyzes the response of neonatal rat spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons in vitro to IR (wavelength = 1,863 nm) using Ca(2+) imaging. Both types of neurons responded consistently with robust intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) transients that matched the low-frequency IR pulses applied (4 ms, 0.25-1 pps). Radiant exposures of \u223c637 mJ/cm(2) resulted in continual neuronal activation. Temperature or [Ca(2+)] variations in the media did not alter the IR-evoked transients, ruling out extracellular Ca(2+) involvement or primary mediation by thermal effects on the plasma membrane. While blockage of Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+) plasma membrane channels did not alter the IR-evoked response, blocking of mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycling with CGP-37157 or ruthenium red reversibly inhibited the IR-evoked [Ca(2+)]i transients. Additionally, the magnitude of the IR-evoked transients was dependent on ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid-dependent Ca(2+) release. These results suggest that IR modulation of intracellular calcium cycling contributes to stimulation of spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons. As a whole, the results suggest selective excitation of neurons in the IR beam path and the potential of IR stimulation in future auditory and vestibular prostheses.",

    "49": "GABAA receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Benzodiazepine exert their action via a high affinity-binding site at the \u03b1/\u03b3 subunit interface on some of these receptors. Diazepam has sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. It acts by potentiating the current evoked by the agonist GABA. Understanding specific interaction of benzodiazepines in the binding pocket of different GABAA receptor isoforms might help to separate these divergent effects. As a first step, we characterized the interaction between diazepam and the major GABAA receptor isoform \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32. We mutated several amino acid residues on the \u03b32-subunit assumed to be located near or in the benzodiazepine binding pocket individually to cysteine and studied the interaction with three ligands that are modified with a cysteine-reactive isothiocyanate group (-NCS). When the reactive NCS group is in apposition to the cysteine residue this leads to a covalent reaction. In this way, three amino acid residues, \u03b32Tyr58, \u03b32Asn60, and \u03b32Val190 were located relative to classical benzodiazepines in their binding pocket on GABAA receptors.",

The proportion of patients in whom cognitive improvement occurs when sleep-potentiated spiking is effectively treated is in >75% of patients (according to 16% of respondents), in 25-75% of patients (according to 52% of respondents), in <25% of patients (according to 20% of respondents), and no or unclear cognitive changes (according to 12% of respondents). The preferred first choice to reduce sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity was high-dose benzodiazepines (47%), valproate (26%), and corticosteroids (15%). The preferred second-choice was valproate (26%), high-dose benzodiazepines (24%), and corticosteroids (23%). Among high-dose benzodiazepines, the preferred one was diazepam 1 mg/kg for one night followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day. The preferred dose of valproate was 30-49 mg/kg/day. Among corticosteroids the preferred choice was oral prednisone 2 mg/kg/day. The most commonly considered endpoints of treatment efficacy were (in decreasing order): response of epileptiform activity in electroencephalography (EEG), cognitive function, and seizure reduction. Results were consistent among respondents with different levels of training and clinical experience. There were differences in conceptualization and treatment approaches between pediatric and adult neurologists.",

The profile of PIMs was also different (the most frequent being benzodiazepines in both Beers criteria lists and aspirin in the STOPP). The number of drugs was associated with risk of prescribing PIMs in all three models, as was the presence of a psychological disorder in the 2003 Beers criteria (odds ratio (OR) = 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-3.40) and the 2012 Beers criteria (OR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.83-4.66).

    "61": "To document the efficacy of clonazepam (CLZ) either free as a solution or loaded in solid lipid nanoparticles (CLZ-SLN) or mixed micelles (CLZ-MM), the in vitro blood-brain barrier permeability of the formulations was determined. Behavior and/or electroencephalograms (EEGs) of rodents receiving treatments were also studied. The in vitro permeability of CLZ increased when associated with SLN, but decreased in the case of MM. The occurrence of the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice was significantly prevented by CLZ, even when exposed a lower dose of CLZ-SLN after administration by the oral route. The behavioral severity and EEGs showing the PTZ-induced paroxystic activity in rats diminished significantly in the presence of CLZ alone (0.3 mg/kg), and were almost totally prevented in the rats treated with CLZ-SLN (equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg). The frequency, duration, and spreading of the spikes-wave of rats treated with CLZ-SLN decreased significantly as compared with CLZ alone, CLZ-MM, or the vehicle. These results show an in vitro-in vivo correlation in the enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability of SLN formulation, and a contribution of MM to the carrier effect of drugs toward the bloodstream and brain, where this pharmaceutical formulation of CLZ-SLN improves the anticonvulsant effect of this benzodiazepine, thus offering additional advantages after oral administration.", 
    "62": "Over the last few years, there has been an increase in the reports of drug-facilitated crimes. The list of drugs associated with these crimes is extensive and benzodiazepines constitute one of the groups of substances more commonly used. The sedative properties, which characterize benzodiazepines, are enhanced when such drugs are combined with alcohol, being more attractive for committing these types of crimes. In this work, a capillary electrophoresis method was applied to the analysis of 63 different samples of club drinks spiked with benzodiazepine tablets. The resulting electropherograms were processed and analyzed with the chemometric multivariate techniques: principal component analysis (PCA) and soft independent modeling of class analogies (SIMCA) classification. The PCA results allowed a clear differentiation of each drug class in a 3D plot. In addition, the SIMCA classification model (5% significance level) showed that eight out of nine test samples were automatically assigned by software to their proper sample class. The conflicting sample was correctly classified in the Coomans' plot (95% confidence). This novel approach based on the comparison of electrophoretic profiles of spiked drinks by chemometric tools allows determining the benzodiazepine used for drink spiking without the use of drug standards. Moreover, it provides an opportunity for the forensic laboratories to incorporate the identification capability provided by the electrophoretic fingerprinting of benzodiazepine solutions in existing or new databases.",

    "67": "The binding of ciprofloxacin (CFX) to human serum albumin (HSA) has been investigated by fluorescence displacement and induced circular dichroism (ICD) measurements. Displacement measurements were performed with CFX in the absence and presence of marker ligands (hemin for domain I, bilirubin for interspace of domain IA and IIA, chloroform for domain II, and diazepam for domain III) to establish CFX binding site in one of the three major domains of HSA. The primary binding site of CFX is located in site I of HSA (domain IIA) in close vicinity to the site where chloroform (CHCl3) binds. It is depicted from the decrease in quenching constant of HSA-CHCl3 system (0.02 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10(-3 )L mol(-1) compared to HSA-CFX-CHCl3 system (0.01 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10(-3 )L mol(-1) as obtained by the fluorescence displacement spectroscopy. Furthermore, far-UV CD results show that the binding of CFX leads to change in the helicity of HSA. The ICD results indicated that the CFX binds to the domain IIA of HSA which is in agreement with the fluorescence displacement results.",

The drivers found to be under the influence of medicines and psychoactive substances were most often stopped for a roadside survey, among whom the percentage of positive results was 92.3% (108 cases out of 117 subjects). Among the total number of positive findings the psychoactive substances used, alone or in combination with other agents, were tetrahydrocannabinols (42.4%), amphetamines (26.5%), opiates (25.7%) and benzodiazepines (15.1%), and their concentration in the blood did not exceed toxic levels.", 
    "71": "In the group of psychoactive substances most often used, either alone or in combination with other agents, there were tetrahydrocannabinols, whose high percentage of positive results in drivers stopped for a roadside control may be explained by commissioning studies on early screening. Concentrations of the substances in most cases did not exceed toxic levels. Roadside examinations, on the basis of their alcohol-like effect, were performed primarily on male drivers.", 
    "72": "Status epilepticus is defined as epileptic seizure with the duration for over 30 min or clustered seizure without complete recovery of consciousness for 30 min or more. From the management point of view, therapeutic intervention is recommended for prolonged seizures for 5 min or more. Intranasal, buccal or intramuscular administration of midazolam is strongly evidence-based and highly recommended method for the treatment of prolonged seizures before the intravenous access. Diazepam or midazolam is the first choice as initial intravenous treatment. Intravenous bolus administration of fosphenytoin or phenobarbital is the second line treatment. General anesthesia using such as thiopental or propofol is indicated for refractory status epileptic, which should be managed in the intensive care unit.", 
    "73": "Recent studies clarified a dynamic regulation of the intracellular trafficking of GABA(A) receptors and its involvement in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. GABA(A) synaptic inhibition decreased in the hippocampal CA1 area of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The reduction of GABAergic inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of gephyrin, a scaffolding protein, and GABA(A) receptor gamma2 subunit. These findings indicate that the reduction of gephyrin impairs the clustering and fixation of GABA(A) receptors in postsynaptic membranes, leading to a decrease in number of GABA(A) receptor subunits and GABA(A) synaptic inhibition. In contrast, the GABA(A) synaptic inhibition was lastingly potentiated in the dentate gyrus of kindled animals and the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits(especially alpha2) was significantly increased in TLE patients. It is plausible that the potentiation of dentate GABAergic inhibition counteracts a hyperexcitability of granule cells as a defense mechanism in epilepsy. In status epilepticus, furthermore, the hippocampal GABA(A) receptor beta3 subunits were significantly disphosphorylated, resulting in a facilitation of the endocytosis of GABA(A) receptors and reduced benzodiazepine sensitivity.",

Currently, laboratory monitoring of pain management patients, if performed, is largely through urine drug measurements.", 
    "77": "Drug half-life calculations can be used as functional markers of the cumulative effect of pharmacogenetics and drug-drug interactions. Assessment of half-life and therapeutic effects may be more useful than genetic testing in preventing adverse drug reactions to pain medications, while ensuring effective analgesia. Definitive, mass spectrometry-based methods, capable of measuring parent drug and metabolite levels, are the most useful assays for this purpose. Urine drug measurements do not necessarily correlate with serum drug concentrations or therapeutic effects. Therefore, they are limited in their use in monitoring efficacy and toxicity.",

    "79": "Thirty-five male, healthy subjects were included in a five-way randomized cross-over study. During each of the periods, sleep was recorded, and residual effects were measured. All subjects received lorediplon 1, 5, and 10 mg, placebo, and zolpidem 10 mg (i.e., active control).", 
    "80": "Polysomnographic evaluation revealed that lorediplon (5 and 10 mg) significantly decreased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and increased total sleep time. Analysis by quarters of the night showed a progressive increasing effectiveness of lorediplon 10 mg across the first three quarters. Lorediplon increased non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep and stage N2 sleep in the second and third quarters. The magnitude of these effects was dose related, with minimal effects seen with 1 mg. No residual effects were observed 13 h post dose.", 
    "81": "Lorediplon demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in sleep, whereas zolpidem showed a more sustained WASO effect. No next-day hangover effects were observed. These sleep effects are also consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of lorediplon. These results warrant clinical trials in patients with insomnia.", 
    "82": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that has clearly demonstrated to be an effective option for the acute management of epileptic seizures. It has the advantage of being water-soluble, with a rapid onset of action and it can be administered orally or intranasally, implementing an early intervention at the pre-hospital setting. This article aims to provide an overview of intranasal midazolam in the acute management of epileptic seizures. Available data suggest that midazolam 0.2 mg/kg is as effective as diazepam 0.5 mg/kg, especially in children with febrile or afebrile seizures. Local mucosal irritation seems to occur in less than one-third of cases while serious side effects such as respiratory depression in about 1%. Future studies need to be focused on adults and optimized technologies for intranasal delivery. Moreover, comparisons with buccal midazolam are warranted.",

In a standardized 100-km highway driving test in normal traffic, subjects were instructed to drive with a steady lateral position and constant speed of 95 km/h. The primary outcome measure of the driving test is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm), i.e. weaving of the car.", 
    "85": "Four driving studies were identified. Driving performance after MOTN administration of traditional benzodiazepine hypnotics was not examined. Zolpidem (10 mg and 20 mg, oral immediate release tablets) significantly impaired driving in a dose-dependent manner, when tested 4 hours after MOTN administration. Also, gaboxadol (15 mg) and zopiclone (7.5 mg) significantly impaired next-morning driving after MOTN administration. In contrast, sublingual zolpidem (3.5 mg) and zaleplon (10 mg and 20 mg) did not significantly affect driving 4 hours after MOTN administration.",

SE can be divided into subtypes based on seizure types and underlying etiologies. Management should be implemented rapidly and based on pre-determined care pathways. The aim is to terminate seizures while simultaneously identifying and managing precipitant conditions. Seizure management involves \"emergent\" treatment with benzodiazepines (lorazepam intravenously, midazolam intramuscularly, or diazepam rectally) followed by \"urgent\" therapy (phenytoin/fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, levetiracetam or valproate sodium). If seizures persist, \"refractory\" treatments include infusions of midazolam or pentobarbital. Prognosis is dependent on the underlying etiology and seizure persistence.

    "88": "This work analyzes the seasonal variation (winter and summer) of ten drugs of abuse, six metabolites and three benzodiazepines in surface waters from the Jarama and Manzanares Rivers in the Madrid Region, the most densely populated area in Spain. The occurrence of these compounds in tap water in this region is also investigated and a preliminary human health risk characterization performed for those substances found in tap water. Finally, a screening level risk assessment that combines the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the compounds studied is also presented. The results of this study show the presence of fourteen out of the nineteen compounds analyzed in winter and twelve of them in summer. The most ubiquitous compounds, with a frequency of detection of 100% in both seasons, were the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE), the amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) ephedrine (EPH), the opioid methadone (METH), the METH metabolite 2-ethylene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), and the three benzodiazepines investigated, namely alprazolam (ALP), diazepam (DIA) and lorazepam (LOR). The highest concentrations observed corresponded to EPH (1020ngL(-1) in winter and 250ngL(-1) in summer). The only compounds not detected in both seasons were heroin (HER) and its metabolite 6-acetylmorphine (6ACM), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and its metabolite 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD (O-H-LSD), and \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In terms of overall concentration, all sampling points presented higher concentrations in winter than in summer. Statistical analyses performed to gather evidence concerning occasional seasonal differences in the concentrations of individual substances between summer and winter showed statistically significantly higher concentrations (p<0.05) of BE, EPH and the opioid morphine (MOR) in winter than in summer. Two out of the nineteen compounds studied, namely cocaine (CO) and EPH, were detected in tap water from one sampling point at concentrations of 1.61 and 0.29ngL(-1), respectively. The preliminary human health risk characterization showed that no toxic effects could be expected at the detected concentration level in tap water. The screening level risk assessment showed that MOR, EDDP and the THC metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) were present in at least one of the sampling sites in a concentration leading to a Hazard Quotient (HQ) value between 1.0 and 10.0, thus indicating some possible adverse effects. The cumulative HQ or Toxic units (TUs) calculated for each of the groups studied showed that opioids and cannabinoids were present at concentrations high enough to potentially generate some adverse effects on at least one sampling point.", 
    "89": "Benzodiazepines are widely used for many diseases, and benzodiazepine overdose is globally increasing in proportion to its prescriptions. Although most benzodiazepine overdoses are known to be safe and nonfatal without coingestions, morbidity or mortality after benzodiazepine overdose is closely related with the duration of unconsciousness or depth of compromised airway. Proper use of flumazenil, a potent antidote of benzodiazepine, seems to accelerate the recovery from the toxicity after benzodiazepine overdose.However, as the case we present demonstrates, careful attention and repetitive evaluations before and after use of flumazenil may be needed in benzodiazepine overdose because resedation occurs in approximately 30% of total flumazenil-treated cases, which suggests that the risk of aspiration or incidental death after administrating flumazenil might be significant without careful monitoring.", 
    "90": "A non-pharmacological method to reduce anxiety is \"progressive relaxation\" (PR). The aim of the method is to reduce mental stress and associated mental processes by means of progressive suppression of muscle tension. The study was addressed to evaluate changes in brain glucose metabolism induced by PR in patients under a stressing state generated by a diagnostic medical intervention. The effect of PR was compared to a dose of sublingual diazepam, with the prediction that both interventions would be associated with a reduction in brain metabolism. Eighty-four oncological patients were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Maps of brain glucose distribution from 28 patients receiving PR were compared with maps from 28 patients receiving sublingual diazepam and with 28 patients with no treatment intervention. Compared to reference control subjects, the PR and diazepam groups showed a statistically significant, bilateral and generalized cortical hypometabolism. Regions showing the most prominent changes were the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. No significant differences were identified in the direct comparison between relaxation technique and sublingual diazepam. Our findings suggest that relaxation induced by a physical/psychological procedure can be as effective as a reference anxiolytic in reducing brain activity during a stressful state.",

A simplified QuEChERS extraction method followed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) has been developed for the simultaneous determination of forensically relevant drugs of abuse (opiates including buprenorphine, methadone and fentanyl and analogues, cocaine and metabolites, amphetamines, LSD) and benzodiazepines and analogues (Z-drugs) in 1mL of human whole blood performing a sole extraction. The method was validated showing good repeatability, accuracy and linearity; LODs were 0.5ng/mL for all benzodiazepines tested while for drugs of abuse LODs varied from 0.05 to 2ng/mL. The method showed high throughput capabilities and was applied on various forensic cases for determination of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse.", 
    "92": "There are only few data available regarding the effects of depressive disorders on road safety due to methodological shortcomings. Patients with acute severe depression or manias are unqualified for driving but after clinical remission driving ability can be attested under psychiatric supervision in most cases. So far there are only few data available about a patient's fitness to drive under psychotropic medication. Regarding the effects of antidepressants on road safety depressed patients obviously benefit from treatment with newer antidepressants; however, at least some subgroups of patients do not reach the performance level of healthy subjects. Approximately 17\u2009% of remission bipolar patients must be regarded as unable to drive and 27\u2009% of patients with schizophrenia on discharge from hospital. Benzodiazepines are clearly associated with increased risk of road traffic accidents. Impaired driving ability of young attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHS) patients is improved under treatment with methylphenidate. Counselling patients with respect to driving ability must be carried out individually taking into account factors of the illness, personality, attitudes and coping strategies as well as different psychopharmacological effects.",

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of the enriched environment on cognitive functions and antidepressant-like effect of prenatally stressed rats. It was important to determine the effect of aripiprazole ARI and olanzapine OLA and clarify whether the enriched environment induces increases in brain derived neurothropic factor BDNF in the hippocampus in the prenatally stressed group (PSG) and non-stressed control group (NSCG).", 
    "94": "The effect of chronic stress applied to pregnant rats and the use of ARI (1.5mg/kg ip) and OLA (0.5mg/kg ip) were studied in the Morris water maze (MWM), Porsolt Forced swimming test (FST) and by determining BDNF levels.",

ARI improved spatial memory both in the NSCG and PSG, while OLA caused memory improvement only in the PSG. Moreover, both ARI and OLA reduced immobility time in the NSCG and PSG. In PSG rats, BDNF decrease was observed while chronic treatment with ARI and OLA increased BDNF levels in the hippocampi of NSCG and PSG rats.", 
    "96": "It has been confirmed that enriched environment improves spatial memory of animals, removes symptoms of stress, has an antidepressant-like effect, and that new neuroleptics, such as ARI or OLA, modulate these functions (increased BDNF).",

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) and latent class analysis (LCA) can both provide clusters of subjects with similar characteristics. The objective of this study was to compare these two methods in pharmacoepidemiology, on several criteria: number of clusters, concordance, interpretation, and stability over time. From a dataset on bromazepam consumption, the two methods present a good concordance. AHC is a very stable method and it provides homogeneous classes. LCA is an inferential approach and seems to allow identifying more accurately extreme deviant behavior.",

Protocols included taper alone (32%), taper plus cognitive behavioral therapy (32%) and taper plus medication substitution (36%). Success rates were favorable for all modalities (mean 60%, median 67%, range 25 - 85%) and independent of dose or duration of use. Common schedules included a 25% dose reduction over 1 - 2 weeks until drug-free. Withdrawal symptoms included mainly mild psychological and somatic concerns. No serious safety events were reported.",

Each rabbit served as its own control by being given a single infusion at the four different times of the day on four separate occasions. The values of the monitored physiological parameters were recorded during the experiment and arterial blood samples were collected for midazolam assay. The pedal withdrawal reflex was used as the measurement of the sedation response. Two and one compartmental models were successfully used to describe midazolam and 1-OH midazolam pharmacokinetics. The categorical pharmacodynamic data were described with a logistic model.",

For 1-OH midazolam, statistically significant time-of-day differences in the apparent volume of distribution and clearance were noticed. They corresponded well with the rabbits' water intake. The noncompartmental and model-based parameters were essentially similar.

Moreover, KYNA reversed the stimulatory effect of glutamate on glioma cell proliferation and enhanced antiproliferative effect of glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and GYKI 52466. Next, KYNA at concentrations much lower than those needed to reduce cell proliferation elicited a prominent inhibitory effect on glioma cell motility.

EMD 386088, administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg evoked specific anxiolytic-like activity in the automated version of the conflict drinking Vogel and the elevated plus-maze tests visible by increasing all parameters indicating a potential anti-anxiety effect. Its activity was blocked by the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB 271046, but not by the selective GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. EMD 386088 did not intensify an anxiolytic-like effect produced by diazepam in the elevated plus-maze test. These findings suggest that EMD 386088, a 5-HT6 receptor agonist, produces anxiolytic-like activity after systemic administration which may result from direct stimulation of 5-HT6 receptors.",

    "131": "Mitochondria capture and subsequently release Ca(2+) ions, thereby sensing and shaping cellular Ca(2+) signals. The Ca(2+) uniporter MCU mediates Ca(2+) uptake, whereas NCLX (mitochondrial Na/Ca exchanger) and LETM1 (leucine zipper-EF-hand-containing transmembrane protein 1) were proposed to exchange Ca(2+) against Na(+) or H(+), respectively. Here we study the role of these ion exchangers in mitochondrial Ca(2+) extrusion and in Ca(2+)-metabolic coupling. Both NCLX and LETM1 proteins were expressed in HeLa cells mitochondria. The rate of mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux, measured with a genetically encoded indicator during agonist stimulations, increased with the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]mt) elevations. NCLX overexpression enhanced the rates of Ca(2+) efflux, whereas increasing LETM1 levels had no impact on Ca(2+) extrusion. The fluorescence of the redox-sensitive probe roGFP increased during [Ca(2+)]mt elevations, indicating a net reduction of the matrix. This redox response was abolished by NCLX overexpression and restored by the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor CGP37157. The [Ca(2+)]mt elevations were associated with increases in the autofluorescence of NAD(P)H, whose amplitude was strongly reduced by NCLX overexpression, an effect reverted by Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibition. We conclude that NCLX, but not LETM1, mediates Ca(2+) extrusion from mitochondria. By controlling the duration of matrix Ca(2+) elevations, NCLX contributes to the regulation of NAD(P)H production and to the conversion of Ca(2+) signals into redox changes.",

    "145": "Carvone is a natural terpene which can be purified as R-(-) or S-(+) enantiomers. There are many reports about its antibacterial, antifungal, and insecticide activities, and also of some effects on the nervous system, where both enantiomers showed different potencies. Considering that the GABA(A) receptor is a major insecticide target, we studied the pharmacological activity of both carvone enantiomers, and of thujone as a reference compound acting on the receptor, on native GABA(A) by determining their effects on benzodiazepine recognition sites using primary neuronal cultures. Both isomers were able to inhibit the GABA-induced stimulation of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding, suggesting their interaction with the GABA(A) receptor as negative allosteric modulators. Their activity was comparable to that described for thujone in the present article, with the R-(-)-carvone being the more similar and potent stereoisomer. The different configuration of the isopropenyl group in position 5 thus seems to be significant for receptor interaction and the bicycle structure not to be critical for receptor recognition. The concentrations necessary to induce negative modulation of the receptor were not cytotoxic in a murine neuron culture system. These results confirm that, at least partially, the reported insecticidal activity of carvones may be explained by their interaction with the GABA(A) receptor at its noncompetitive blocker site.", 
    "146": "Investigation of the role of stress in cocaine addiction has yielded an efficacious combination of metyrapone and oxazepam, hypothesized to decrease relapse to cocaine use by reducing stress-induced craving. However, recent data suggest an extra-adrenal role for metyrapone in mediating stress- and addiction-related behaviors. The interactions between the physiological stress response and cocaine self-administration were characterized in rodents utilizing surgical adrenalectomy and pharmacological treatment. Male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.25mg/kg/infusion) and food pellets under a concurrent alternating fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement. Surgical removal of the adrenal glands resulted in a significant decrease in plasma corticosterone and a consequent increase in ACTH, as expected. However, adrenalectomy did not significantly affect ongoing cocaine self-administration. Pretreatment with metyrapone, oxazepam and their combinations in intact rats resulted in a significant decrease in cocaine-reinforced responses. These same pharmacological treatments were still effective in reducing cocaine- and food-reinforced responding in adrenalectomized rats. The results of these experiments demonstrate that adrenally-derived steroids are not necessary to maintain cocaine-reinforced responding in cocaine-experienced rats. These results also demonstrate that metyrapone may produce effects outside of the adrenal gland, presumably in the central nervous system, to affect cocaine-related behaviors.",

Our objectives were to investigate whether OP-induced SE leads to the emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs), the hallmark of chronic epilepsy, and if so, to assess the efficacy of benzodiazepine therapy following SE onset in preventing the epileptogenesis. We also explored early changes in hippocampal pyramidal cells excitability in this model. Adult rats were poisoned with the paraoxon (450\u03bcg/kg) and immediately treated with atropine (3mg/kg) and obidoxime (20mg/kg) to reduce acute mortality due to peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Electrical brain activity was assessed for two weeks during weeks 4-6 after poisoning using telemetric electrocorticographic intracranial recordings. All OP-poisoned animals developed SE, which could be suppressed by midazolam. Most (88%) rats which were not treated with midazolam developed SRSs, indicating that they have become chronically epileptic. Application of midazolam 1min following SE onset had a significant antiepileptogenic effect (only 11% of the rats became epileptic; p=0.001 compared to non-midazolam-treated rats). Applying midazolam 30min after SE onset did not significantly prevent chronic epilepsy. The electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, assessed electrophysiologically in hippocampal slices, were not altered by OP-induced SE. Thus we show for the first time that a single episode of OP-induced SE in rats leads to the acquisition of chronic epilepsy, and that this epileptogenic outcome can be largely prevented by immediate, but not delayed, administration of midazolam. Extrapolating these results to humans would suggest that midazolam should be provided together with atropine and an oxime in the immediate pharmacological treatment of OP poisoning.",

BZD use was assessed at an in-home visit. Every six months thereafter, study outcomes were assessed via telephone for 8.5-years. Mobility was assessed with the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). Functioning was quantified with level of difficulty in five basic activities of daily living (ADL: bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, eating), and six instrumental activities of daily living (IADL: shopping, managing money, preparing meals, light and heavy housework, telephone use). Pain was measured by frequency per week and the magnitude of interference with daily tasks. All analytic models were adjusted for relevant covariates and mental health symptoms.

Here, we used a multisite linear electrode array to measure local field potentials simultaneously across the CA1 layers of the hippocampus during active exploration, and employed current source density analysis and computational modeling to investigate how midazolam and atropine-two amnestic drugs that are used clinically and experimentally-change the relative timing and strength of the drivers of \u03b8-oscillations. We found that two dipoles are present, with active inputs that are centered at the soma and the distal apical dendrite and passive return pathways that overlap in the mid-apical dendrite. Both drugs shifted the position of the phase reversal in the local field potential that occurred in the mid-apical dendritic region, but in opposite directions, by changing the strength of the dendritic pole, without altering the somatic pole or relative timing. Computational modeling showed that this constellation of changes, as well as an additional effect on a variably present mid-apical pole, could be produced by simultaneous changes in the active somatic and distal dendritic inputs. These network-level changes, produced by two amnestic drugs that target different types of receptors, may thus serve as a common basis for impaired memory encoding.", 
    "230": "To be able to treat prolonged epileptic crises practical, safe and effective rescue medication is needed. Today, the standard treatment in community healthcare is rectal diazepam. The introduction of a buccal solution of midazolam opens up a new perspective in their treatment.", 
    "231": "To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of buccal midazolam with respect to rectal diazepam for children diagnosed with epilepsy who present prolonged convulsive seizures in the community setting in Spain.", 
    "232": "The study produces a model of its cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (SNS), with the outcomes presented in terms of cost-quality adjusted life years. Data were collected from different sources, including estimations regarding the clinical effectiveness from a clinical trial, from a Delphi panel in Spain and from a national survey carried out on parents of children with epilepsy in order to determine the current practices.", 
    "233": "Treatment with buccal midazolam produces a saving in costs in comparison to rectal diazepam. The amount saved by the Spanish SNS comes to 5,484 euros per patient per year. Treatment with buccal midazolam offers an improved health-related quality of life. This, together with the savings in costs, means that there is a dominance of buccal midazolam over rectal diazepam in all the settings that have been examined.", 
    "234": "The results obtained with the model show that buccal midazolam is more cost-effective than rectal diazepam due to a reduction in the need to call out ambulances and for stays in hospital, as well as an improved health-related quality of life.", 
    "235": "Coste-efectividad de una solucion bucal de midazolam en el tratamiento de las crisis convulsivas prolongadas en el entorno ambulatorio en Espa\u00f1a.", 
    "236": "Introduccion. El tratamiento de las crisis epilepticas prolongadas requiere disponer de una medicacion de rescate comoda, segura y efectiva. Actualmente, el tratamiento estandar en la comunidad es el diacepam rectal. La introduccion de una solucion bucal de midazolam abre una perspectiva nueva en el tratamiento. Objetivo. Evaluar el coste-efectividad del midazolam bucal respecto al diacepam rectal para los ni\u00f1os con un diagnostico de epilepsia que presentan crisis convulsivas prolongadas en la comunidad en Espa\u00f1a. Materiales y metodos. Modelo coste-efectividad desde la perspectiva del Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS) espa\u00f1ol, con resultados presentados en terminos de costes y a\u00f1os de vida ajustados por calidad. Los datos se obtuvieron de varias fuentes, incluidas las estimaciones de efectividad clinica de un ensayo clinico, de un panel Delphi en Espa\u00f1a y de una encuesta nacional a padres de ni\u00f1os con epilepsia para determinar las practicas actuales. Resultados. El tratamiento con midazolam bucal produce un ahorro de costes en comparacion con el diacepam rectal. El ahorro para el SNS espa\u00f1ol es de 5.484 euros por paciente al a\u00f1o. El tratamiento con midazolam bucal ofrece una mejora en la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud. Esto, unido al ahorro de costes, hace que el midazolam bucal sea dominante frente al diacepam rectal en todos los escenarios examinados. Conclusion. Los resultados del modelo muestran que el midazolam bucal es mas coste-efectivo que el diacepam rectal debido a una reduccion en la necesidad de llamadas a la ambulancia y estancias en el hospital, asi como a una mejora en la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud.", 
    "237": "A 54-year-old woman diagnosed with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome in 2007 presented with a 1-year history of visual hallucinations requiring admission to a psychiatric unit. The hallucinations resolved while on olanzapine and hydroxychloroquine but recurred when they were stopped. Despite restarting olanzapine, her visual hallucinations persisted. When she started a tapering dose of prednisolone, all the hallucinations resolved. This report adds to the small literature on psychiatric manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and provides evidence that low-dose corticosteroids may be an effective treatment for this manifestation.", 
    "238": "Although drug-induced sedation endoscopy (DISE) represents the most widespread diagnostic tool for upper airway endoscopic evaluation of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), many controversies exist about how to perform the sedation, the indications for DISE, and how to report DISE findings. The present position paper reports on a consensus as proposed by a group of European experts in the field of DISE after discussion during a recent dedicated meeting.", 
    "239": "The authors have evaluated all the available evidence reported in the literature and have compared experience among various departments in leading European centers in order to provide a standardization of the DISE procedure and an in-depth insight in the main aspects of this technique.", 
    "240": "A proposal of the DISE procedure standardization has been achieved with a general agreement concerning the terminology, indications, contraindications, required preliminary examinations, setting, technical equipment required, staffing, local anesthesia and nasal decongestion, patient positioning, basis and special diagnostic maneuvers, and the applied sedation drugs and observation windows. Otherwise, no consensus has been reached on a scoring and classification system.", 
    "241": "Although consensus has been reached on several aspects of the DISE procedure, some topics remain open to future research, such as a better analysis of the importance of positional aspects during DISE and a further comparison of the differences in degree, level and pattern of upper airway collapse observed during DISE versus during natural sleep and awake endoscopy. Finally, a universally accepted scoring and classification system is lacking.", 
    "242": "Ziprasidone is increasingly used for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The purpose of this study was to compare healthcare costs and use associated with ziprasidone and olanzapine.", 
    "243": "Ziprasidone and olanzapine treatment episodes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients were identified in the 01/2007-12/2010 IMS LifeLink\u2122 Database. The period of analysis for each episode has three components: 6 months prior to the episode initiation date (pre-episode period), 1 month immediately following the episode initiation date (initiation month), and up to 12 months after the end of the initiation month (follow-up period). Ordinary least squares regressions, general linear models, and two-part models were used to compare various types of costs (2007 US$) associated with the use of ziprasidone and olanzapine. Logistic regressions, Poisson regressions, and Hurdle models were used to compare the number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations associated with each drug.", 
    "244": "We identified 7,138 (46.93 %) ziprasidone episodes and 8,072 (53.07 %) olanzapine episodes, and found that patients using ziprasidone were significantly younger (41.50 vs. 45.38 years) and were significantly less likely to be male (29.81 vs. 44.21 %). Regression analysis showed no significant differences in total costs between the two drugs. However, ziprasidone was associated with significantly higher medication costs (US$232, p < 0.01) and outpatient costs (US$501, p < 0.05), yet lower ED costs (-US$73, p < 0.05). Ziprasidone was also associated with fewer ED visits (0.266, p < 0.001) and hospitalizations (1.117, p < 0.001).", 
    "245": "Ziprasidone is associated with higher medication costs and outpatient costs than olanzapine; however, it reduces patients' use of ED and inpatient services.", 
    "246": "There is hardly evidence on maintenance treatment with antidepressants in primary care. Nevertheless, depression guidelines recommend maintenance treatment i.e. treatment to prevent recurrences, in patients with high risk of recurrence, and many patients use maintenance treatment with antidepressants. This study explores the characteristics of patients on maintenance treatment with antidepressants in general practice, and compares these characteristics with guideline recommendations for maintenance treatment.", 
    "247": "We used data (baseline, two-year and four-year follow-up) of primary care respondents with remitted depressive disorder (\u22656 months) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n\u200a=\u200a776). Maintenance treatment was defined as the use of an antidepressant for \u226512 months. Multilevel logistic regression was used to describe the association between sociodemographic, clinical and care characteristics and use of maintenance treatment with antidepressants.", 
    "248": "Older patients, patients with a lower education, those using benzodiazepines or receiving psychological/psychiatric care and patients with a concurrent history of a dysthymic or anxiety disorder more often received maintenance treatment with antidepressants.", 
    "249": "Measurements were not made at the start of an episode, but at predetermined points in time. Diagnoses were based on interview (CIDI) data and could therefore in some cases have been different from the GP diagnosis.", 
    "250": "Since patients with chronic or recurrent depression do not use maintenance treatment with antidepressants more often, characteristics of patients on maintenance treatment do not fully correspond with guideline recommendations. However, patients on maintenance treatment appear to be those with more severe disorder and/or more comorbidity.", 
    "251": "This analysis investigated the correlations between the efficacy of olanzapine monotherapy and the number of concurrent manic symptoms in patients treated for bipolar depression.", 
    "252": "Pooled data from 2 placebo-controlled olanzapine studies in patients with bipolar I depression were analyzed (total 1214 patients; 690 olanzapine monotherapy patients and 524 placebo patients). Patients were categorized for mixed features by the number of concurrent manic symptoms at baseline (0, 1 or 2, and \u22653, respectively, as measured by a Young Mania Rating Scale item score \u22651). Efficacy was evaluated by change in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to 6 weeks.", 
    "253": "Least-squares mean differences between olanzapine and placebo in the change of MADRS total scores were -3.76 (p=0.002), -3.20 (p<0.001), and -3.44 (p=0.002) for mixed features 0, 1 or 2, and \u22653, respectively. The response rates for olanzapine versus (vs.) placebo were 52.6% vs. 39.8%, 50.3% vs. 40.0%, and 42.2% vs. 33.7% for mixed features 0, 1 or 2, and \u22653, respectively. The remission rates for olanzapine vs. placebo group were 46.1% vs. 34.3%, 39.5% vs. 32.0%, and 34.8% vs. 24.1% for mixed features 0, 1 or 2, and \u22653, respectively.
