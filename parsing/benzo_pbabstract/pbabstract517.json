SAAVE is uniquely designed to elevate levels of enkephalin(s), serotonin, catecholamines, and GABA, which are believed to be functionally deficient in alcoholics. Twenty-two patients were studied. The SAAVE patients, as compared to the control group (a) had a lower BUD (building up to drink) score, 1 vs 2; (b) required no PRN benzodiazepines, 0% vs 94%; (c) ceased tremoring at 72 h, as compared to 96 h; and (d) had no severe depression on the MMPI, in contrast to 24% of control group. These preliminary data suggest that SAAVE is a valuable adjunct to therapy by aiding the patient's physical adjustment to a detoxified state while facilitating a more positive response to behavioral therapy.", 
    "1": "After single 10-mg intravenous (IV) doses of desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) to 12 healthy human volunteers, (mean age, 62 years) blood samples were obtained over the next 14 or more days. Mean kinetic variables were volume of distribution (Vd), 90 liters; elimination half-life (t1/2), 93 hours; and clearance, 12.3 mL/min. Vd was significantly correlated with body weight (r = .73, P less than .01) and with percent ideal body weight (r = .91, P less than .001). Eleven of the same subjects also received 5- to 15-mg doses of IV diazepam (DZ). Mean kinetic variables were Vd, 180 liters; t1/2, 83 hours; and clearance, 28 mL/min. Clearances of DZ and DMDZ were significantly correlated (r = .73, P less than .02). Based on area analysis, the extent of conversion of DZ to systemic DMDZ averaged 53%. After oral administration of DMDZ in tablet form (10 mg), or of clorazepate dipotassium in capsule form (15 mg), systemic availability of DMDZ from each of the oral dosage forms was not significantly different from 100%.", 
    "2": "This paper describes a procedure for the analysis of whole blood by six commonly used EMIT d.a.u. assays: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine metabolite, opiates, amphetamines, and the cannabinoid 20 assays using the Syva Autocarousel and the COBAS MIRA. The sensitivity of the method rivals that of other immunoassay methods, such as RIA, for the detection of drugs in blood. The procedure has been successfully applied to the analysis of several hundred postmortem forensic blood specimens.", 
    "3": "1. Intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were performed on mouse spinal cord and cerebral hemisphere neurones grown in primary dissociated cell culture. The effects of several anxiolytics applied by local pressure ejection on responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) evoked by iontophoresis were investigated. Responses to GABA were depolarizing since intracellular chloride ion concentration was increased by injection from potassium chloride (3M)-filled recording micropipettes and neurones were held at large negative membrane potentials (-70 to -90 mV). The agents studied were six 'non-sedative anxiolytics', CL 218,872 (3-methyl-6-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)1,2,4-triazolo(4,3-b) pyridazine), PK 8165 (2-phenyl-4-(2-(4-piperidinyl)ethyl)-quinoline), PK 9084 (2-phenyl-4-(2-(3-piperidinyl)ethyl)-quinoline), CGS 9896 (2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,5-dihydropyrazolo(4,3-c)quinoline-3(3H)-one) , ZK 91296 (ethyl 5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-beta-carboxylate), buspirone (8-4-[4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane- 7,9- dione), and two sedative anxiolytics, diazepam and zopiclone [( 6-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl)-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin- 5- yl]4-methyl-1-piperazinecarboxylate). 2. Direct effects on responses to GABA were studied for all drugs applied in varying concentrations. For the drugs which significantly altered responses to GABA, the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo(1,5a)-(1,4)benzodi azepine - 3-carboxylate) and CGS 8216 (2-phenylpyrazolo(4,3-c)-quinolin-3(5H)-one) were evaluated. For the drugs devoid of significant direct effect on responses to GABA, the influence on diazepam-induced enhancement of responses to GABA was evaluated. 3. Diazepam, zopiclone and CL 218,872 concentration-dependently and reversibly enhanced responses to GABA. Maximal enhancement was 82% for diazepam (500 nM), 64% for zopiclone (10 microM) and 20% for CL 218,872 (10 microM). PK 8165 effects varied with concentration, enhancing responses to GABA (up to 18%) at nM concentrations and reducing responses to GABA (up to 90%) at microM concentrations. CGS 9896, ZK 9126, PK 9084 and buspirone, in concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 10 microM, lacked significant direct effects on responses to GABA. 4. The enhancing effects of diazepam, zopiclone, CL 218,872 and PK 8165 were antagonized by Ro 15-1788. However, the reducing effect on responses to GABA of PK 8165 at microM concentrations was not antagonized by CGS 8216. CGS 9896 and ZK 91296 concentration-dependently blocked the diazepam-induced enhancement of responses to GABA. However, PK 9084 and buspirone did not antagonize the diazepam-induced enhancement of responses to GABA. 5. These results indicate that diazepam and zopiclone may be full agonists, CL 218,872 and PK 8165 are partial agonists, and CGS 9896 and ZK 91296 are pure antagonists at benzodiazepine receptors. On the other hand, PK 9084 and buspirone do not interact with benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "4": "The anticonvulsive action of lidocaine was tested in mice against a series of convulsants, and its profile of action compared with that of phenytoin. Both agents antagonized seizures induced by ouabain or glutamate (injected i.c.b.), effects attributable to reduction of the sodium conductance of neuronal membranes. Lidocaine and phenytoin were relatively ineffective against convulsants that act on synaptic chloride channels via the GABA-ionophore receptor complex. At higher dose levels, both lidocaine and phenytoin are excitatory within limited ranges. Lidocaine-induced seizures were potentiated by phenytoin, and antagonized by chlordiazepoxide, phenobarbital, valproate, trimethadione and muscimol, but not by ethosuximide. This profile of action is similar to that of bicuculline, suggesting that lidocaine may bind to the GABA recognition site and to another site in the GABA-ionophore receptor complex. Phenytoin-induced excitation was antagonized by chlordiazepoxide, less effectively by phenobarbital or trimethadione, only minimally by valproate, and not by trimethadione or muscimol. Phenytoin is known to bind to picrotoxin and benzodiazepine receptor sites; these findings suggest that it may be excitatory at one or both of these sites.", 
    "5": "The effects of intrathecally administered benzodiazepines diazepam, flurazepam and flunitrazepam on the pain thresholds in rats were studied by using chronically implanted catheters. Despite benzodiazepine-induced marked muscle relaxation and sedative effect, benzodiazepines produced no significant changes in the thresholds during tests of tail flick and paw compression whereas morphine was effective in both tests. Experiments with 14C-diazepam and 3H-flunitrazepam showed that after intrathecal administration these substances rapidly enter the brain. It was found that 10-15 minutes after intrathecal administration 3H-flunitrazepam concentration in the frontal parts of the brain is 1/4 of its concentration in the lumbar spinal cord. The data suggest that these benzodiazepines possess no antinociceptive activity at intrathecal administration to rats and that way of administration fails to prevent their action on the brain.", 
    "6": "This study investigates the prevalence and pattern of benzodiazepine use in an isolated Australian rural general practice setting. Some clinical features of psychological dependence were also examined. Data were obtained from 771 patients attending each of two general practices over a five-day period. The results indicated that 11.3% of the sample had used a benzodiazepine in the preceding four weeks and that 82% of these had been regular users for over six months. Prevalence increased with age and 36.5% of patients over the age of 70 were using benzodiazepines. Features suggesting some degree of psychological dependence were found in over 50% of users. The findings illustrate the extensive and prolonged use of benzodiazepines and raise questions about overuse and dependence, particularly in the elderly.", 
    "7": "We report two cases of severe withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a long-term normal-dose benzodiazepines (BZD) administration. Case 1, a 61-year-old man, suffered from delirium on the 7th day after abrupt discontinuation of nitrazepam, 10 mg/day. Case 2, a 49-year-old woman, suffered from auditory hallucination on the 4th day and visual cognitive disorder on the 5th day after abrupt discontinuation of nitrazepam, 5 mg/day, and triazolam, 0.5 mg/day. A withdrawal syndrome after discontinuation of normal-dose BZD is uncommon, and a psychotic withdrawal reaction is even more uncommon. We show how a continuous administration of BZD for a period of longer than 6 months and the presence of severe insomnia are risk factors predictive of a psychotic reaction. We also explain the predictive method used to determine the onset time of such a severe state. In the case of a psychotic state, we recommend intravenous diazepam injection. To prevent withdrawal reaction, we also recommend a gradual reduction after administration of normal-dose BZD.", 
    "8": "The muscarinic receptors coupled to pepsinogen secretion on isolated frog esophageal peptic cells have been characterized using functional and radioligand binding techniques. N-[3H]methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS) binding to intact cells was complex and indicative of a high affinity, low capacity site and a high capacity uptake site. Binding to the high capacity site was inhibited by atropine with high affinity (IC50, 3 nM) and by imipramine and propranolol with IC50 values of 70 and 270 nM, respectively. After inhibition of uptake by 30 microM propranolol, [3H]NMS bound to a single population of high affinity sites (KD, 125 +/- 16 pM), which exhibited binding site maximum of 2.1 fmol/10(6) cells, equivalent to 1260 sites/cell. Binding to these sites was reversible, stereoselective and inhibited by muscarinic receptor agonists with an order of potency: oxotremorine greater than acetylcholine greater than carbachol greater than bethanechol and by antagonists with an order of potency:atropine greater than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116 (11-2[2-[[diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one). Pepsinogen secretion was stimulated by the agonists with an order of potency: acetylcholine greater than or equal to carbachol greater than oxotremorine greater than bethanechol. Atropine, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 competitively inhibited carbachol-stimulated pepsinogen secretion with pA2 values of 9.58, 7.37 and 6.68, respectively, which correlated with their log (inhibition constants) for receptor binding. By contrast, agonists with significant efficacy exhibited EC50 values which were 20 to 90 times lower than their inhibition constants for binding which suggests the possibility of \"spare\" muscarinic receptors. Our findings indicate that functional muscarinic receptors on peptic cells exhibit similar characteristics to the high affinity sites labeled by [3H]NMS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Programmed electrical stimulation, also known as electrophysiologic studies (EPS), is a cardiologic technique used to help guide physicians in their management of selected patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Data are presented for 14 consecutive patients undergoing EPS seen in psychiatric consultation who had a diagnosis related to anxious mood. Successful management strategies, which evolved from work with these patients, included psychologic approaches (supportive psychotherapy and education) and psychopharmacologic agents (most commonly alprazolam). EPS and related physiologic aspects of anxiety and stress are briefly reviewed.", 
    "10": "To examine the relationship of aminergic overactivity to information processing, we gave methylphenidate hydrochloride, oxazepam, or placebo to 12 nonpsychotic patients in one-week blocks in a double-blind, randomized design. Methylphenidate induced a pattern of information processing dysfunction similar to that seen in schizophrenic patients, strengthening the linkage of the schizophrenia-information processing dysfunction-aminergic overactivity relationship. Further, the time course of the observed deficits in both schizophrenic and methylphenidate-induced states is strikingly compatible with the temporal mapping pattern of monoaminergic neuronal systems. More research is needed to identify definitively the aminergic influences on attentional functioning. A psychophysical task-pharmacologic probe strategy should prove useful.", 
    "11": "Fifty-two patients with panic disorder who had been receiving active benzodiazepine treatment for 8 weeks were assessed by using the outcome measures of spontaneous and situational panic attacks, scores on the Hamilton scales for anxiety and for depression, and scores on self-rated disability scales. Although spontaneous panic attacks were not affected by the presence of any personality disorder, the remaining outcome measures showed a strong and negative association with DSM-III antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. There was also a mild negative association with avoidant personality disorder. A subgroup of patients with both major depression and panic disorder appeared more strongly affected.", 
    "12": "The expression of the mRNAs encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor was examined in the bovine cerebellum by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The alpha subunit mRNA, which encodes the benzodiazepine binding site, was localized in all Purkinje and granule cells and in some cells of the molecular layer. The distribution of the beta subunit mRNA, which encodes the GABA binding site, only partially overlapped with that of the alpha subunit mRNA. While cells in the granule cell layer expressed the beta subunit mRNA, no message could be detected in other cell populations. These findings suggest that the subunit composition of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor is heterogeneous and that additional, as yet unidentified, beta subunits exist.", 
    "13": "The effects of the kappa-opioid receptor agonists tifluadom, bremazocine and U-50,488 on locomotor activity (test: toggle-floor box) and memory (test: passive avoidance) were assessed in C57BL/6 (C57) and DB/2 (DBA) mice. The drugs administration resulted in activity depression in both strains, the effect was higher in DBA mice and was enhanced by pretreatment with haloperidol and with muscimol. Memory impairment was observed in DBA mice following posttraining administration of all drugs. This effect was enhanced by immobilization stress and decreased by familiarization with the apparatus. Memory improvement was evident in C57 mice (U-50,488 experiments). In a research carried out with CD1 mice, amygdaloid lesions decreased the memory impairing effect of U-50,488. The results are compared with those previously obtained with mu agonists and, as concerns memory, are discussed in terms of the involvement of emotional factors in mice responses to kappa agonists administration.", 
    "14": "The effects of diazepam and muscimol on locomotor activity were examined in Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, derived by selective breeding methods from randomly bred Sprague-Dawley (RB) rats for increased behavioural and physiological sensitivity to the anticholinesterase, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Previous reports of increased behavioural sensitivity to oxotremorine, associated with increased striatal and hippocampal muscarinic receptor concentrations, were confirmed in FSL rats compared to RB rats. The FSL rats were more sensitive to the locomotor suppressant effects of diazepam and muscimol compared to RB. Binding experiments with [3H]-diazepam showed that FSL rats had an increased benzodiazepine receptor concentration in the striatum and hippocampus compared to Flinders Resistant Line rats (FRL). FRL did not differ significantly from RB in diazepam-induced changes in locomotor activity or the concentration of benzodiazepine receptors. No significant differences in the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors was detected between the three rat lines in the brain regions investigated. Thus FSL rats showed an increased behavioural sensitivity to both diazepam and muscimol which was associated with a greater concentration of benzodiazepine receptors in the striatum and hippocampus compared to RB and FRL rats.", 
    "15": "The effects of several newly synthesized pyrazolo [4,3-d] pyrimidine-7-ones and pyrazolo-5-carboxamides on [3H]-flunitrazepam and [3H]-cyclohexyladenosine binding in rat cerebral cortex membranes have been studied. The compounds under examination, displaying affinities in the micromolar range for both benzodiazepine and adenosine A1 receptors, could be of interest in the study of a possible link between the two receptor systems.", 
    "16": "Three behavioral animal models have been described: a feline and a rodent model of chronic anxiety, and a rodent model of \"fearless\" behavior. The models have been obtained by pre- or perinatal exposure to diazepam (DZ) or RO 15-1788 which produced enduring postnatal deficits or enrichment, respectively, of brain benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors. The receptor-deficient one-year-old cat progenies showed hyperarousal, unabated restless behavior, delayed acquisition of instrumentally conditioned behavior, bizarre escape responses and absence or reduced alpha-like EEG activity. The receptor-deficient rat progencies, studied at the age of 5-6 months, showed a reduction of time spent in deep slow wave sleep, and inability to habituate to novel environment, such as the radial arm maze. In the maze, the behavior of these progenies was characterized by delayed and incomplete exploratory activity often terminated by sudden escape, numerous fecal deposits and significantly more frequent than normal errors of \"working memory.\" On the other hand, in all aspects, the receptor-enriched progenies were superior to the control animals as well as to the receptor-deficient group, particularly when the animals were challenged by novel and \"intimidating\" visual and/or auditory stimuli. In addition, 12 out of 51 receptor-deficient rats reared for 18 months developed mammary fibroadenomas, while no such tumors were found in the group of 44 vehicle-exposed control animals. Increased density and affinity of BDZ brain receptors was also observed after adult rats were treated with RO 15-1788 administered water for 7 or 14 days.", 
    "17": "The pharmacological characteristics and anatomical distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the human hippocampal formation were studied in seven cases aged 4-68 years. The pharmacology of the receptors was studied by computerized, non-linear least squares regression analysis of [3H]flunitrazepam displacement by flunitrazepam, CL218,872 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding to membranes and the anatomical localization of these receptors was demonstrated using quantitative autoradiography following in vitro labelling of cryostat sections with [3H]flunitrazepam. The pharmacological studies indicated that the human hippocampal formation contained equal numbers of benzodiazepine receptors with high affinity (Type I) and low affinity (Type II) for CL218,872 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. The autoradiograms demonstrated that the benzodiazepine receptors were distributed in a heterogeneous fashion throughout the major regions of the human hippocampal formation; the highest concentrations of receptors were present in the dentate gyrus (molecular layer) and field CA1 of Ammon's horn (strata pyramidale, oriens, lacunosum), with moderate concentrations in field CA2 of Ammon's horn (stratum pyramidale) and in regions of the subicular complex and entorhinal cortex, and with considerably lower densities in fields CA3 and CA4. Quantitative analyses of the autoradiograms showed that the regions containing the highest densities of receptors (molecular layer of dentate gyrus and the strata oriens, pyramidale and lacunosum of CA1) were enriched with Type 1 receptors whereas other regions of lower receptor densities were enriched with either Type I or Type II receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The effect of chronic treatment with the beta-carboline, FG 7142, followed by chronic treatment with diazepam (DZP) on the acute effects of DZP and FG 7142 were studied. Mice were treated for 16 days with FG 7142 (40 mg/kg i.p.) followed by treatment with DZP (5 or 20 mg/kg i.p.) for 9 days. At the end of this period, the anticonvulsant, antipunishment and locomotor sedative properties of a test dose of DZP were assessed, as were the convulsant properties of FG 7142. During the chronic treatment with FG 7142, 80% of the mice developed clonic convulsions in response to the beta-carboline, and this increased sensitivity to FG 7142 (kindling) remained following the chronic DZP treatment. Thus long-term treatment with DZP does not reverse the changes which occur during FG 7142-induced kindling. Chronic treatment with DZP for 9 days gave rise to tolerance to its pharmacological effects as assessed in the 4-plate test of antipunishment activity, in a test of locomotor sedation, and by its ability to increase the convulsant threshold of intravenously administered pentylenetetrazol. The development of tolerance to DZP was not affected by a prior chronic treatment with FG 7142. Nor were the acute effects induced by DZP altered by a prior chronic treatment with FG 7142. Apart from reducing its own convulsant threshold, chronic treatment with FG 7142 had no effect in any of the experiments. These results suggest that kindling induced by FG 7142 and tolerance to DZP depend on different mechanisms. In neither case were the pharmacological changes induced by chronic administration reflected by changes in the biochemical measures of the coupling between benzodiazepine binding sites and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors.", 
    "19": "Ethanol (2 g/kg) reduces the time spent in social interaction and increases locomotor activity of pairs of NIH Swiss mice. This study examined whether two benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists, RO 15-4513 (3 mg/kg) and FG 7142 (30 mg/kg) are able to reverse these effects. Neither drug alone altered social behavior, but both significantly attenuated the effect of ethanol on social interaction. They did not affect the ethanol-induced increase in motor activity. Benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists thus appear capable of antagonizing some, but not all of the behavioral effects of ethanol in this paradigm.", 
    "20": "The benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) and N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142), were given to rats at various stages of a passive avoidance task. When the drugs were given before trial 1, low doses enhanced, and high doses impaired, performance as assessed 24 h later. A group given drugs on both trials showed that the impairment was not due to state-dependent effects. When the drugs were given immediately after trial 1, or before trial 2, they were without effect, except for the low dose of DMCM which impaired consolidation. It is discussed whether the changes in passive avoidance performance are due to direct or indirect effects. Between-trial habituation of exploratory head-dipping was measured in a holeboard. When FG 7142 was given before trial 1, the high dose impaired between-trial response decrement; but this was because it decreased the level of head-dipping on trial 1. When FG 7142 was given immediately after trial 1, or before trial 2, it was without effect on between-trial habituation.", 
    "21": "In a previous report we described the use of flunitrazepam as a photoaffinity label to monitor the turnover of the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex in primary brain and spinal cord cell cultures [Science (Wash. D. C.) 226:857-860 (1984)]. In the present communication we have extended our studies on the kinetics of receptor turnover and have examined the mechanism of receptor degradation. There are approximately 60,000 irreversible binding sites per neuron, and photolabeling is stereospecific. Photolabeling does not demonstrably alter the kinetics of degradation, and a complete rate equation relating the kinetic constants for degradation to receptor number is described. The rapid phase of degradation is slowed at low temperature (Q10 = 5, which corresponds to an apparent energy of activation of 25 kcal/mol) and by inhibitors of ATP production (sodium azide, 2-deoxyglucose, and 2,4-dinitrophenol). The fast phase for the degradation of photolabeled receptor is not affected by lysosomotropic agents (methylamine, ammonium chloride, and chloroquine) or by elimination of horse serum and chick embryo extract from the growth medium. In contrast, overall protein degradation is inhibited by methylamine and enhanced in serum-free medium. The results suggest that the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex is degraded through an energy-dependent nonlysosomal pathway.", 
    "22": "In a previous report, mitochondria were proposed as a subcellular structure where recognition sites for peripheral benzodiazepine ligands are located in adrenal glands. The present study examines the subcellular distribution of specific binding sites for PK 11195 in eight tissues and compares the relative densities of these binding sites in mitochondrial-enriched fractions with the relative activities of two mitochondrial marker enzymes. In all eight tissues examined, PK 11195 binding sites were found to subfractionate in a manner nearly identical to that of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. The subcellular distribution patterns of specific PK 11195 binding sites were unrelated to the distribution patterns of marker enzymes for plasma membranes, lysosomes, or endoplasmic reticulum. Scatchard analyses of mitochondrial fractions from all eight tissues demonstrated a greater than 100-fold difference in the densities of PK 11195 binding sites, the extremes being 140 and 1 pmol/mg of protein in adrenal and brain tissues, respectively. There was no correlation between the relative density of PK 11195 binding sites and the specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase. These results suggest that the density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in mitochondria is tissue dependent and apparently regulated independently of the mechanisms by which these two mitochondrial enzymes are expressed or function. The photoaffinity probe PK 14105 was used to photolabel the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites of mitochondrial fractions prepared from the eight tissues. In all preparations, a 17,000-Da polypeptide is specifically labeled as determined by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Thus, it appears that the protein recognition site for isoquinoline carboxamides of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor complexes is similar in all mitochondrial preparations.", 
    "23": "The integrity of GABA-A receptors and of central benzodiazepine receptors was evaluated in membrane preparations from prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei obtained at autopsy from nine cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma and an equal number of age-matched control subjects. Histopathological studies revealed Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis in all cases in the cirrhotic group; controls were free from neurological, psychiatric or hepatic diseases. Binding to GABA-A receptors was studied using [3H]muscimol as radioligand. The integrity of central benzodiazepine receptors was evaluated using [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro15-1788. Data from saturation binding assays was analyzed by Scatchard plot. No modifications of either affinities (Kd) or densities (Bmax) of [3H]muscimol of central benzodiazepine binding sites were observed. These findings do not support recent suggestions that alterations of either high-affinity GABA or benzodiazepine receptors play a significant role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "24": "When gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in vertebrate brain, binds to its receptor it activates a chloride channel. Neurotransmitter action at the GABAA receptor is potentiated by both benzodiazepines and barbiturates which are therapeutically useful drugs (reviewed in ref. 1). There is strong evidence that this receptor is heterogeneous. We have previously isolated complementary DNAs encoding an alpha- and a beta-subunit and shown that both are needed for expression of a functional GABAA receptor. We have now isolated cDNAs encoding two additional GABAA receptor alpha-subunits, confirming the heterogeneous nature of the receptor/chloride channel complex and demonstrating a molecular basis for it. These alpha-subunits are differentially expressed within the CNS and produce, when expressed with the beta-subunit in Xenopus oocytes, receptor subtypes which can be distinguished by their apparent sensitivity to GABA. Highly homologous receptor subtypes which differ functionally seem to be a common feature of brain receptors.", 
    "25": "The 3-substituted beta-carbolines 2-4 and 5-7 were prepared from 3-amino-beta-carboline (8) in one step via diazotization, followed by reaction with the appropriate nucleophile in order to determine their binding affinity for benzodiazepine receptors (BzR). All three of the 3-alkoxy-beta-carbolines 2 (IC50 = 124 nM), 3 (IC50 = 24 nM), and 4 (IC50 = 11 nM) have high affinities for BzR. The beta-carbolines substituted with electron-withdrawing groups including 5 (Cl; IC50 = 45 nM), 6 (NO2; IC50 = 125 nM), and 7 (N = C = S; IC50 = 8 nM) also had high affinities for BzR. The affinities of 5-8 clearly indicate that a carbonyl moiety at position 3 of a beta-carboline is not required for high-affinity binding to BzR. These findings have led to the development of a model for the binding of ligands to an inverse agonist domain at BzR. This model is supported by the recent synthesis of 3-ethoxy-beta-carboline (3), a potent, long-lived partial inverse agonist, and 7, an irreversible BzR ligand.", 
    "26": "Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(thien-3-yl)- and 2-(thien-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-ones are reported. A number of the compounds possessed 1 order of magnitude higher affinity for the receptors than diazepam. Planarity was one of the structural requirements for binding to benzodiazepine receptors. The activities of agonists and inverse agonists were assessed on the basis of inhibition or facilitation of the pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions, respectively. Thien-3-yl compounds exhibited inverse agonist activity whereas thien-2-yl analogues with a 5'-alkyl group showed agonist activity. Substitution on the quinoline moiety did not enhance in vivo activity. The most potent compounds were the 5-methylthien-3-yl derivative 6a as an inverse agonist and the 5-methylthien-2-yl compound 13a as an agonist.", 
    "27": "In a search for pharmacologically-active ingredients in the plant extract Karmelitter Geist, we have isolated and identified a high-affinity benzodiazepine receptor ligand, amentoflavon. Amentoflavon binds in a mix-type competitive and non-competitive manner to brain benzodiazepine receptors with an IC50-value of 6 nM in vitro, comparable to the affinity of diazepam. Amentoflavon shows a GABA ratio of 1.4 at 0 degrees and increases 35S-TBPS binding by 12% (60 min incubation at 25 degrees), which indicates a partial agonistic effect on benzodiazepine receptors. The substance does not influence the binding of a variety of other brain receptor ligands. Amentoflavon does not inhibit 3H-flunitrazepam-binding to brain benzodiazepine receptors following i.v. administration in the mouse in vivo, and it is therefore not likely that amentoflavon is responsible for any pharmacological effect of Karmelitter Geist.", 
    "28": "Inhibitors of platelet activation, alprazolam, iloprost and SRI 63-441, were used to demonstrate the necessity of embryo-derived platelet-activating factor (PAF) activity for the establishment of pregnancy in mice. In a splenectomized mouse bioassay 6 micrograms alprazolam inhibited, for 3 h, the thrombocytopenia induced by 0.1 micrograms PAF; 4 micrograms iloprost and 0.5 microgram SRI 63-441 were effective for 6 and 12h respectively. The administration of 2 micrograms iloprost/30 g body weight on Days 1 and 4 of pregnancy and twice daily on Days 2 and 3 caused a 50% reduction (P less than 0.0005) in the number of implantation sites in the uterus at Day 8 of pregnancy, without affecting (P greater than 0.05) the number of corpora lutea. A similar reduction in the number of implantation sites was achieved with 20 micrograms SRI 63-441/30 g body weight/day. The reduction in implantation rate was evident on Day 5 of pregnancy by visualizing the implantation sites with pontamine sky blue. SRI 63-441 had no effect on peripheral blood progesterone concentrations from Day 1 to Day 9 of pregnancy, and did not appear to inhibit implantation by blocking the preimplantation surge of oestradiol. The number and morphology of blastocysts flushed from the uterus of Day 4 inhibitor-treated mice was not different (P greater than 0.05) from the controls. The cleavage rate and morphology of embryos cultured from the 2-cell to blastocyst stage in media containing SRI 63-441 or iloprost (10 micrograms/ml) were normal, precluding a gross toxic effect. Simultaneous administration of 1 microgram PAF-acether to treated animals re-established pregnancy rates to levels not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) from the controls.", 
    "29": "In this study we examined a novel, orally effective, nonpeptidal cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, 3S(-)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-yl) -1H-indole-2-carboxamide (L364,718) on CCK-induced amylase release. We used isolated rat pancreatic acini and incubated them with CCK-8 with or without various CCK receptor antagonists. L364,718 (3-100 nM), proglumide (1-10 mM), and the proglumide derivative CR1409 (1-30 microM) each caused a progressive rightward shift in the CCK-8 dose-response curve without a change in maximal amylase secretion. Plotting the data according to the method of Schild indicated competitive inhibition. The Kis for L364,718, CR1409, and proglumide were 0.25 nM, 0.15 microM, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Thus L364,718 was 600-fold more potent than CR1409 and 2,000,000-fold more potent than proglumide in inhibiting CCK-8-induced amylase release. Inhibition of 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 binding to acini by these receptor antagonists had a similar rank potency. L364,718 was tested against other pancreatic exocrine secretagogues and was effective against agonists that only act through the CCK receptor. In rats, diversion of pancreatic juice from the duodenum stimulated pancreatic amylase output and elevated plasma CCK levels. The stimulated amylase secretion was blocked by intravenous administration of L364,718. Furthermore, extracted plasma CCK from rats with diversion of pancreatic juice from the duodenum stimulated amylase release from pancreatic acini, and this stimulation was blocked by addition of L364,718.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "The goal of this study was to make functional comparisons between muscarinic receptors mediating endothelial-dependent relaxation responses in the rabbit ear artery and receptors mediating endothelial-independent contractile responses. Ring segments of the bovine coronary artery with the endothelium removed proved to be an excellent model for studying the properties of muscarinic receptors mediating vascular smooth muscle contraction. Although endothelial-dependent relaxation responses could be seen with the calcium ionophore A-23187, no relaxation responses to cholinergic agonists were seen in the bovine coronary artery, whether or not the endothelium was present or in the presence or absence of smooth muscle tone. In ring segments of the bovine coronary artery or the rabbit ear artery, the cholinergic agonists, acetylcholine, methacholine and carbachol, proved to be approximately equipotent in evoking contraction or relaxation, respectively. In contrast, the putative M1 selective agonist McN-A-343 did not produce any effect in either tissue; nor did McN-A-343 have any effect on a perfused rabbit ear artery segment. Measurement of antagonist affinities indicated that the bovine coronary artery muscarinic receptors show low affinity for both pirenzepine (pKB = 6.9) and AF-DX 116 (11-2-[[2-[diethylaminomethyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) (pKB = 6.3). Pirenzepine affinity was also low in the perfused rabbit ear artery preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Using intracellular recording techniques in the rat hippocampal slice, we observed that muscarinic agonists produce a transient Ca2+-dependent depolarization that may be related to the phosphatidylinositol cycle. First, it was more readily produced by muscarinic group A agonists, which strongly enhance the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) than by group B agonists, which are less efficacious. Second, the Ca2+-dependent response was blocked by pirenzepine (PRZ), a selective muscarinic antagonist that blocks PIP2 breakdown in forebrain. Both group A and group B muscarinic agonists caused equivalent maintained levels of depolarization that were relatively insensitive to PRZ. The data suggest that the Ca2+-dependent response is fundamentally unlike other muscarinic responses that have been described in hippocampus.", 
    "32": "Quantitative receptor binding autoradiography technique was utilized to study GABA and benzodiazepine receptors in the cat motor thalamus (ventral anterior, ventral medial and ventral lateral nuclei) and adjacent thalamic subdivisions. Binding parameters (Bmax and Kd) and distribution pattern of the binding sites for 3 tritiated ligands [3H]muscimol ([3H]MUS), [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FLU) and [3H]baclofen ([3H]BAC) were analyzed and compared using measurements from discrete and anatomically well-defined thalamic regions. There was little correlation in the regional distribution of the 3 binding sites. The concentration of [3H]BAC binding sites in thalamic nuclei of interest was very low, practically at the limit of resolution of the quantitative autoradiographic technique; whereas appreciable quantities of [3H]MUS and [3H]FLU binding sites were present in the motor and adjacent limbic nuclei of the thalamus. There was more difference between the nuclei in regard to the number of high affinity GABA receptors than benzodiazepine receptors. Moreover, the ratio of Bmax[3H]MUS/Bmax[3H]FLU varied from 2.2 to 4.4 in different thalamic regions suggesting the presence of a diverse population of GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors. The distribution pattern of the 3 binding sites was compared to the topography of GABAergic afferents of the basal ganglia origin and the frequency of GABAergic synapses formed by thalamic local circuit neurons (LCN) in the motor thalamus that were established earlier. It was concluded that in the cat motor thalamus: (1) none of the ligands studied appear to reveal the receptors associated with nigro- or pallidothalamic synapses; (2) [3H]MUS binding sites may be associated with the dendrodendritic contacts formed by LCN; and (3) the [3H]FLU binding sites are physically unrelated to [3H]MUS binding sites. The concentration of [3H]FLU and [3H]MUS binding sites in the midline nuclei and of [3H]MUS binding sites in the limbic nuclei was remarkably high. It was concluded that in addition to previously suggested limbic structures, the midline nuclei with their very high content of benzodiazepine receptors may be considered as a neuroanatomical substrate of certain forms of anxiety.", 
    "33": "Radiation inactivation is a method to determine the apparent target size of molecules. In this report we examined whether radiation inactivation of various enzymes and brain receptors is influenced by the preparation of samples preceding irradiation. The apparent target sizes of endogenous acetylcholinesterase and pyruvate kinase from rat brain and from rabbit muscle and benzodiazepine receptor from rat brain were investigated in some detail. In addition the target sizes of alcohol dehydrogenase (from yeast and horse liver), beta-galactosidase (from Escherichia coli), lactate dehydrogenase (endogenous from rat brain), and 5-HT2 receptors, acetylcholine muscarine receptors, and [35S] butyl bicyclophosphorothionate tertiary binding sites from rat brain were determined. The results show that apparent target sizes are highly influenced by the procedure applied for sample preparation before irradiation. The data indicate that irradiation of frozen whole tissue as opposed to lyophilized tissue or frozen tissue homogenates will estimate the smallest and most relevant functional target size of a receptor or an enzyme.", 
    "34": "A method for determining telenzepine in human serum is described. Analytes are obtained from alkalinized serum by extraction of the drug using reversed-phase octadecylsilane-bonded silica cartridges. Telenzepine and a desmethyl analogue added to serum as internal standard are retained on the C18 cartridge and recovered by elution with methanol. The gas chromatographic properties of telenzepine and the internal standard are improved by a two-step derivatization involving a benzodiazepinone-benzimidazole rearrangement and simultaneous formation of a methyl ester function. The processed extract is analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring. Quantification is linear over the range 2-40 ng/ml. Inter-day precision is within 7%, except at the detection limit of 2 ng/ml (16%). Application of this assay to routine analysis is limited by the extensive sample pretreatment essential for derivatization of telenzepine.", 
    "35": "Quality control of routine drug assays, like most immunoassays, should mainly be the responsibility of each individual laboratory: intra-laboratory quality control. External quality assessment should direct its efforts in particular to non-routine methods and to new assays. However, it may sometimes also be very useful to have laboratory results of routine assays studied in external programmes, since vague requests or difficult interpretations of drug concentrations need discussion outside the individual laboratory.", 
    "36": "N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), phencyclidine (PCP), and quisqualate receptor binding were compared to benzodiazepine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in the putamen and cerebral cortex of individuals with Huntington's disease (HD). NMDA receptor binding was reduced by 93 percent in putamen from HD brains compared to binding in normal brains. Quisqualate and PCP receptor binding were reduced by 67 percent, and the binding to other receptors was reduced by 55 percent or less. Binding to these receptors in the cerebral cortex was unchanged in HD brains. The results support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity plays a role in the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease.", 
    "37": "Intracerebroventricular somatostatin administration to conscious rats results in a characteristic motor abnormality (barrel rotation), convulsions that are frequently fatal and destruction of cerebellar Purkinje cells. This study demonstrates that each of these manifestations of this neuropeptide can be attenuated by pretreatment with diazepam (Valium, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) but not in vehicle-pretreated controls. Specifically, the incidence of mortality was reduced from 5/12 controls to 2/20 diazepam-treated rats, the incidence of barrel rotation was reduced from 6/12 controls to 2/20 diazepam-treated rats and the incidence of Purkinje cell death was reduced from 4/4 examined controls to 4/13 diazepam-treated animals. Vehicle pretreated rats did not differ from untreated rats. Thus, in addition to blocking somatostatin-induced motor dysfunction and mortality, diazepam offers significant protection from central neuronal cell death in the cerebellar cortex.", 
    "38": "Modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to the GABAA recognition site by ethanol and/or diazepam appears to change with the age of the animal. Brain tissue above the cerebellum of young, mature, and old rats was examined for an age-related change in the GABAA recognition sites 5 min after the rat was last habituated or received a single injection of the vehicle, ethanol and/or diazepam. The dose of ethanol injected was reduced in the senescent rats, so the brain levels of ethanol did not vary with age. An injection of ethanol and/or diazepam (180 micrograms/kg) did not significantly alter the GABAA recognition site in any age group relative to the habituated or vehicle-injected rats of that age group. However, the affinity of the GABAA recognition site was decreased by ethanol in mature and old rats relative to the affinity of the GABAA site after diazepam pretreatment in the presence and absence of ethanol, respectively. Finally, the combination of ethanol and diazepam elicited an increase in the number of GABAA binding sites relative to diazepam pretreatment in only the young rats. The present results indicate that the GABAA binding site is modulated by ethanol and diazepam in an age-dependent manner.", 
    "39": "[3H]Flunitrazepam, [3H]PK 11195, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B activity were measured in male rats 1, 3 and 7 days following laparotomy. The surgery resulted in the up-regulation of central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in cerebral cortex and of peripheral BZ binding sites in brain and kidney on the first and third days after operation. This increase was followed by a decrease to normal range 7 days after the surgical procedure. [3H]QNB binding to muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex as well as MAO A and B activity in rat cerebral cortex and kidney were not affected by the surgical manipulation. The modulatory effect of surgery on BZ receptors corresponds to stages of the healing process in surgical wounds.", 
    "40": "Isolated mouse islets were used to identify the muscarinic receptor subtype present in pancreatic B-cells. We thus compared the inhibitory potencies of atropine (non-specific), of pirenzepine (specific for M1 receptors) and of compound AF-DX 116 (specific for cardiac M2 receptors) on acetylcholine-induced insulin release, 86Rb+ efflux and 45Ca2+ efflux. The three antagonists inhibited all effects of acetylcholine, but EC50 values were markedly different: atropine = 1.5-5 nM, pirenzepine = 0.6-1.7 microM and AF-DX 116 = 1.7-11 microM. The results did not suggest that the various effects of ACh could result from the activation of different subtypes of receptors. It is concluded that muscarinic receptors of pancreatic B-cells belong to an M2 subtype distinct from the cardiac M2 receptors.", 
    "41": "The binding interactions of some thioureylene compounds to human serum albumin were studied in vitro by ultraviolet spectroscopy and equilibrium dialysis. Binding of 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil, 6-n-benzyl-2-thiouracil and 2-thiouracil to human serum albumin results in a red shift of the ultraviolet absorption maximum, suggesting that the binding site is a hydrophobic area of the protein. Bindings of 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil and 6-n-benzyl-2-thiouracil to human serum albumin are characterized by two classes of sites while 6-n-propyl-uracil and 2-thiouracil bind to one low-affinity binding site. In addition, an identification of those sites was performed by measuring the displacement of these drugs. The data show that the moderate-affinity site is common with the warfarin site while the low-affinity site is likely to be shared by benzodiazepines. It is concluded that the binding is enhanced by the hydrophobicity of the substituent in the thioureylene compounds, and it is further shown that thiol-group substitutions in the thioureylene ring will weaken the binding.", 
    "42": "Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate a subcutaneous injection of physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg) from a similar injection of saline in a two-lever, food-reinforced behavior paradigm. The training dose of physostigmine reduced the response rate to about 50% of that in saline sessions. The discriminative stimulus (DS) effect of physostigmine is mediated by a central cholinergic mechanism since it was antagonized by scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg), but was unaffected by methylscopolamine (1 mg/kg) or pirenzepine (3 mg/kg). Neostigmine produced predominantly saline-appropriate lever choice. Compounds which produced averages of greater than 80% responses on the physostigmine lever are: compound BM-5 (N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-4-pyrrolidino-2-butynyl)-acetamide), tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA), RS-86 (2-ethyl-8-methyl-2,8-diazaspiro-(4,5)-decan-1,3-dion hydrobromide), cis-AF30 (2-methyl-spiro-(1,3-dioxolane-4,3')-quinuclidine), and pilocarpine. In comparison, oxotremorine, aceclidine (3-acetoxy-quinuclidine), arecoline, and nicotine produced a maximum average responding of 40-70% on the physostigmine lever. The DS effect of physostigmine in rats appeared to involve a greater participation of M1 and M2 muscarinic or the nicotinic receptor in the brain.", 
    "43": "After labelling the brain benzodiazepine receptors of sub-human primates with [11C]RO15-1788, the interactions of different benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ligands were studied by positron emission tomography (PET). Various doses of either RO15-1788, RO15-3505 or propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate were injected intravenously 20 min after the radiotracer, and induced an immediate and specific dose-dependent displacement of the brain radioactivity. However, a comparison of the dose-receptor occupancy patterns of these three antagonists established from the displacement experiments revealed that only propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate displayed clear biphasic dose-receptor occupancy curves. This indicates that, in the living primate brain, there are two different benzodiazepine receptor subpopulations (which can be either different benzodiazepine receptor subtypes or distinct conformational states of a single receptor).", 
    "44": "The neurotransmitter glutamate activates the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate and kainate receptors. It has been proposed, but also disputed, that local release of glutamate would play a pivotal role in cortical spreading depression (SD). We tested this hypothesis by investigating the influence of NMDA antagonists on SD, using the non-competitive NMDA antagonists ketamine, phencyclidine (PCP) and MK-801 and the competitive NMDA antagonist DL-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (2-APH), injected intraperitoneally in rats anesthetized with alfentanil. SD was elicited by cathodal DC-stimulation of the frontal cortex. SD propagation was followed using two ion-sensitive microelectrodes placed in the parietal and occipital cortex. The NMDA antagonists increased SD threshold, decreased the propagation velocity and decreased the duration of the accompanying extracellular DC, K+ and Ca2+ changes at the following doses: 40 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg PCP, 0.63 mg/kg MK-801, 10 and 40 mg/kg 2-APH. With each NMDA antagonist failure of SD propagation between both microelectrodes could be observed. SD elicitation (or propagation) was inhibited completely with 80 mg/kg ketamine, 3.1 mg/kg MK-801 and 160 mg/kg 2-APH. These NMDA antagonists have also anticonvulsant properties. None of these effects on SD were observed with high doses of other anticonvulsants such as 80 mg/kg phenytoin or 40 mg/kg diazepam. These experiments indicate that endogenous release of excitatory amino acids and their action on the NMDA receptor play an important role in the initiation, propagation and duration of SD.", 
    "45": "Chronic ethanol treatment which produced intoxication and physical dependence in rats, produced an increase in the specific binding of ethanol antagonist [3H]RO15-4513 in rat brain cerebral cortex and cerebellum, but not in hippocampus and striatum. The increase in both the regions was due to an increase in the number (Bmax) of receptor sites. These results suggest that the RO15-4513 binding sites on the oligomeric GABA receptor complex are altered following chronic ethanol administration, and support the notion of a unique role of RO15-4513 as an ethanol antagonist.", 
    "46": "The system of double coaxial cylinders filled with water was used as a device for studying simple extrapolation behaviour of rats. The amount of rats which were able to dive under the lower edge of the inner cylinder, without reaching the bottom of the outer cylinder and the latency of this avoidance reaction were considered as a measure of extrapolation ability. This reaction was altered by the pretreatment of animals with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Piracetam as a standard nootropic, sodium and lithium hydroxybutyrate as substances with a potential nootropic effect were shown to be able to antagonize the damaging effect of cycloheximide on the avoidance performance. Benzodiazepine tranquilizer, phenazepam, in contrast to nootropics, evokes additional worsening of extrapolation reaction. Normalization of avoidance disturbed by cycloheximide, can be used as an adequate and informative approach for screening of nootropics.", 
    "47": "The effects were studied, in eight healthy volunteers, of premedication with diazepam 0.14 mg kg-1 by mouth or hyoscine 6 micrograms kg-1 + morphine 0.2 mg kg-1 i.m., or no premedication, on toxic symptoms and plasma concentrations after rapid i.v. injection of lignocaine 1 mg kg-1. The alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin plasma protein fractions were assessed. A variety of mild central nervous system (CNS) symptoms were experienced after the bolus of lignocaine. However, there was no correlation between premedication and degree of severity or number of CNS symptoms. The highest single arterial plasma concentration of lignocaine was 11.0 micrograms ml-1, 1 min after injection. There was no correlation between plasma concentration of lignocaine and occurrence of CNS symptoms. Furthermore, there was no correlation between AAG or albumin plasma concentrations and lignocaine plasma concentrations.", 
    "48": "The relations between the single high affinity binding sites for azapropazone, phenylbutazone, chlorpropamide, sulfathiazole, and iophenoxate and the binding regions of human serum albumin represented by the marker ligands diazepam, phenol red, salicylate, and warfarin were examined by a series of competition experiments. Binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis at pH 7.0. In order to ensure an accurate analysis of the competition experiment, the number of moles of ligand bound per mole of protein was usually 0.4 or less to minimize ligand binding to weaker sites. Furthermore, binding of both ligands was determined in all experiments (except for iophenozate). None of the test ligands competed with diazepam for a common high affinity binding site, but, surprisingly, they were all able to displace two or three of the other marker ligands according to a competitive scheme. These findings show, first, the existence of a particular serum albumin region for high affinity binding of diazepam. Secondly, they imply that it is not necessary to assume the existence of new drug binding regions beyond those existing for phenol red, salicylate, and warfarin. On the contrary, the relatively many examples of competitive binding indicate that the binding regions represented by the last-mentioned three marker ligands are placed quite close to each other in the albumin molecule in a common region, which is suggested to be located at subdomains 1C and 2A-B. The region must be relatively large, because in some cases independent high affinity binding of pairs of ligands is observed. It is probably also rather flexible, inasmuch as no clear relation could be found between the chemical structure of the test ligands and the two or three marker ligands with which they compete. Correlations between primary association constants and partition coefficients for both marker ligands and test ligands, in the unionized forms, between n-hexane or 1-octanol and aqueous media showed that hydrophobic forces are important for the binding processes. However, the data also showed that other attractive forces must be operative as well.", 
    "49": "The role of endogenous opioids and cholecystokinin (CCK) in gastric emptying was investigated in mice killed 30 min after gavage with 51Cr-radiolabeled liquid meals. The meals consisted of 0.5 ml of milk or one of five synthetic meals containing arabic gum, glucose and/or arachis oil and/or casein. Naloxone (0.1 mg/kg sc) significantly (P less than 0.01) accelerated gastric emptying of milk and meals containing fat but did not modify gastric emptying of nonfat meals. The CCK antagonist asperlicin (0.1 mg/kg ip) increased by 25% gastric emptying of milk. The gastric emptying of meals containing glucose and casein but not fat was reduced after administration of the COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8, 4 micrograms/kg ip). This decrease was antagonized by both asperlicin (10 mg/kg ip) and naloxone (0.1 mg/kg sc). Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of an opiate antagonist that poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier, methyl levallorphan (10 micrograms/kg), did not modify gastric emptying of milk but accelerated it when peripherally administered (0.1 mg/kg sc). Similarly, asperlicin (icv) administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg did not affect milk emptying. These results indicate that endogenous opiates are involved at peripheral levels in the regulation of gastric emptying of fat meals only and that such regulation involves release of CCK.", 
    "50": "The complete amino acid sequence of porcine muscarinic acetylcholine receptor III has been deduced by cloning and sequencing the genomic DNA. The antagonist binding properties of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor III expressed from the cloned DNA in Xenopus oocytes correspond most closely to those of the pharmacologically defined M2 glandular (III) subtype.", 
    "51": "Midazolam is a very useful drug in outpatient aesthetic surgery. Its principal advantages are (1) short duration of action (a half-life of 2.3 hours), (2) painless injection, (3) no incidence of postoperative phlebitis (as compared with diazepam), and (4) a high degree of safety and effectiveness. Since one of the main objectives in outpatient surgery is to have the patient recover as quickly as possible and be discharged without any significant drug hangover, we recommend the incorporation of midazolam into the armamentarium of the aesthetic surgeon. Subsequent to the presentation of this paper (Twentieth Annual Meeting of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, in Los Angeles, California, March 23, 1987), we have administered midazolam to an additional 400 patients undergoing outpatient surgery and no apnea has occurred requiring an airway or supportive respiratory measures.", 
    "52": "Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in rats by administration of 3 mmol/kg lithium chloride followed 24 h later by injection of 25 mg/kg pilocarpine. Treatment with 20 mg/kg diazepam was initiated at the time each of four EEG patterns was seen: (i) discrete electrographic seizures; (ii) waxing and waning epileptiform activity; (iii) continuous, high-amplitude, rapid spiking; and (iv) periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) on a relatively flat background. Success of diazepam in stopping all seizure activity was predicted by the EEG pattern seen at the time of treatment. All rats treated while displaying discrete electrographic seizures had status stopped with diazepam, but only three of six with waxing and waning epileptiform activity and one of six each with continuous spiking and PEDs. Rats which continued to seize had a decrease in spike amplitude of 74.8 +/- 18.25% following diazepam injection. These data confirm the clinical impression that the longer the duration of status epilepticus, the more difficult it is to control and suggest that the EEG pattern at the time of treatment predicts the probability of success.", 
    "53": "Purified tribulin, an endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, has been identified by direct probe insertion mass spectrometry as the indole-2,3-dione, isatin. A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric assay for isatin has been developed and used to measure its relatively high concentrations in unpurified human urine, and in rat heart and brain. Isatin is a known compound with a broad range of biological activity; this is the first report of its presence in the animal body. Isatin is a potent inhibitor of MAO, particularly of MAO B (IC50, 3 microM), and also binds to central benzodiazepine receptors (IC50 against clonazepam, 123 microM).", 
    "54": "Pituitary cells were cultured as three-dimensional reaggregates in serum-free chemically defined medium supplemented with different concentrations of dexamethasone. Immunostaining of the cells using a polyclonal antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies raised against choline acetyl transferase (CAT), revealed the presence of CAT immunoreactivity in 4-10% of anterior pituitary cells depending on the antibody used. CAT immunoreactivity was also found in freshly dispersed anterior pituitary cells. CAT-immunoreactive cells could be enriched on BSA and Percoll gradients and codistributed with ACTH-immunoreactive cells in these gradients. Perifusion of the aggregates with the potent muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (Atr) resulted in a dose-dependent (0.1-100 nM) increase in both basal PRL and GH secretion; the response was dependent on the dexamethasone concentration in the culture medium. A similar response to Atr was observed in organ-cultured pituitaries. The specificity of the Atr effect was supported by the findings that the potent and highly specific muscarinic receptor blocker dexetimide showed a similar action, whereas its inactive enantiomer levetimide and the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium failed to do so. Two other muscarinic antagonists, benzatropine and pirenzepine, showed a dose-dependent hormone-releasing action similar to that of Atr, but were less potent than the latter. Pirenzepine was only effective at high molar concentrations, suggesting that an M2 muscarinic receptor subtype was mediating the present phenomenon. Atr also potentiated GH release stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and PRL release stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, but had no effect on GRF-stimulated GH release. The choline uptake blocker hemicholinium abolished the effect of Atr on GH and PRL release. These data suggest that certain pituitary cells can express CAT activity and that these cells exert a tonic inhibitory activity on GH and PRL release which is mediated by a cholinomimetic substance, possibly acetylcholine, through a muscarinic receptor.", 
    "55": "The effects of the IP administration of RO 15-4513 (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg), fluoxetine (5 and 10 mg/kg) and desipramine (5 and 10 mg/kg) on the intake of 10% ethanol, H2O and food were determined in the selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) and -nonpreferring (NP) lines of rats with daily access to fluids being limited to single 2-hour sessions. The imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 (a partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist) significantly reduced the intake of 10% ethanol by the P rats to 50-60% of control levels in the first 30 minutes without altering food or H2O intake. The attenuating actions of 2 mg/kg Ro 15-4513 on ethanol intake could be completely blocked by the central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg). Ro 15-1788, by itself, produced no effects on alcohol and H2O consumption. The 5 mg/kg dose of fluoxetine significantly reduced 10% ethanol intake by the P rats to 20% of control values without altering either H2O or food consumption. The 10 mg/kg dose of fluoxetine further reduced ethanol intake by the P rats, but this dose also reduced daily food intake to approximately 70% of normal. Desipramine at both doses significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced both ethanol and food uptake by the P rats and had a tendency to reduce H2O consumption as well. In general, the three drugs had effects in the NP rats similar to those observed for the P group, although the effects on 10% ethanol intake were difficult to compare because of the low, variable intake of alcohol by the NP group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The cardiovascular effects of intravenous sedation were studied in fifty patients after spinal anaesthesia for lower limb or pelvic surgery. Twenty patients received propofol (mean dosage 74 (SD 4) micrograms/kg/min for 0-20 minutes and 51 (SD 7) micrograms/kg/min for 20-40 minutes), twenty received midazolam (35 micrograms/kg + 2.54 (SD 0.2) micrograms/kg/min for 0-20 minutes and 1.35 (SD 0.2) micrograms/kg/min for 20-40 minutes) and ten patients received saline infusion only. The forearm vasoconstriction in response to the spinal anaesthesia was measured by strain gauge plethysmography. Spinal anaesthesia lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 18 (SED 4) mmHg and 9 (SED 2) mmHg respectively. (SED = standard error of the difference.) This was associated with a 32% decrease in mean forearm blood flow. Propofol and midazolam caused similar additional reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (10 (SED 4) mmHg and 4 (SED 2) mmHg) and a decrease in heart rate (P less than 0.005), but forearm vasoconstriction was not altered. In the control group, however, forearm vasoconstriction increased during 40 minutes in theatre (P less than 0.05). Recovery from propofol was far more rapid than after midazolam and was virtually complete in ten minutes. This was reflected by an increase in blood pressure and in forearm vasoconstriction in the recovery period.", 
    "57": "Two subjects presented with periodic leg movement (PLM) syndrome during sleep that was characterized by marked sleep fragmentation and repetitive short central apnoeas. Treatment of PLM using Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine with hypnotic properties, markedly reduced the sleep fragmentation due to PLM and, despite its depressant properties on the central nervous system, controlled the repetitive central apnoeas. These two observations, although rare, give insight into the role of non-ventilatory variables in the development of sleep apnoea. Significant sleep fragmentation should be considered when assessing factors leading to respiratory instability during sleep and/or the pathophysiology of sleep apnoea syndromes.", 
    "58": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10.0 mg/kg IP) and buspirone (0.05-1.0 mg/kg SC) were compared by a \"blind\" observer using the shock-probe/burying test for anxiolytics. Both anxiolytic agents decreased rats' burying behavior toward the continuously electrified (2 mA) shock probe, and increased the number of probe-shocks rats received. These bidirectional, anxiolytic drug effects occurred at doses that did not affect the rats' general activity, and these anxiolytic effects generally increased as a function of drug dose. The relative potency of buspirone was substantially greater than that of chlordiazepoxide. These results contrast with those of Craft et al. and suggest that inappropriate methodology may have contributed to the inconsistencies in various results. In any case, under the present parameters, this \"repeated shock\"-probe test appears to have two advantages over the previous, \"single shock\" procedure. First, increases in probe-shocks and decreases in probe-burying provide two, concurrent measures of anxiolytic drug effects in the same setting. Second, nearly all subjects receive shock in the repeated shock procedure, compared to only 60-80% of subjects in the single shock procedure. Thus, both in terms of behavioral validity and simple economy, the repeated shock-probe procedure warrants further investigation as a selective test of anxiolytic agents.", 
    "59": "A 33-year-old female presented for elective excision of a posterior fossa tumour following two generalized seizures six months earlier. The patient had been asymptomatic on phenytoin 300 mg/day. Two h pre-operatively, a 300-mg dose of phenytoin was administered, general anesthesia induced and pancuronium bromide given to achieve neuro-muscular paralysis. Respiration was supported and anesthesia maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Thirty min into the operation a further 2-mg dose of pancuronium bromide was administered. One h later, the patient coughed. A peripheral nerve stimulator was applied to the right common peroneal nerve with surface electrodes. Over the next 75 min a total of 15 mg of pancuronium bromide was required. With each dose there was a complete loss of response to peripheral nerve stimulation, followed by a rapid return of full train-of-four response, accompanied by coughing and cerebral engorgement. At this point, metocurine iodide was administered with full sustained paralysis for 45 min. Blood samples collected during a second operation indicated the patient had an extremely short pancuronium elimination half-life and a small volume of distribution. Several explanations are offered including phenytoin induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of pancuronium, alterations in tissue or protein binding and/or alterations in myoneuronal junctional response.", 
    "60": "In primates, separation of an infant from its mother is a naturally occurring stressor resulting in activation of behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic systems. When separated from their mothers, infant rhesus monkeys emit frequent species-typical distress vocalizations ('coos'). In earlier work we demonstrated that opiate and benzodiazepine systems influence the frequency of coos induced by separation in infant rhesus monkeys. The present studies assessed the role of alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic systems in mediating distress vocalizations. We found that the alpha 2 agonist, clonidine (33 and 67 micrograms/kg), reduced activity levels without affecting separation-induced coos. Only at 100 micrograms/kg were distress vocalizations reduced, and this was associated with behavioral sedation. In the same animals, morphine (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg) selectively reduced distress vocalizations without affecting activity. Thus, the effects of clonidine, 100 micrograms/kg, appear to be due to non-specific sedation. We next assessed whether antagonism of beta-adrenergic receptors reduces separation distress. We administered propranolol over a wide dosage range to a different group of animals and found that a high dose (20 mg/kg) increased separation-induced coos while decreasing the activity levels. That such a high dose was necessary to affect coo vocalizations suggests that effects on vocalizations are due to non-specific effects of the drug. Unlike propranolol, morphine administered to these animals did not affect activity levels but did selectively reduce distress vocalizations. These findings suggest that alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic systems do not specifically mediate separation-induced coos in infant rhesus monkeys. However, as demonstrated in an earlier study, opiate systems have a prominent role.", 
    "61": "The effect of the anxiolytic agents, buspirone and diazepam, on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), indicated by changes in the concentration of corticosterone (CS) in plasma, were studied 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after administration of the drug (i.p.). Samples of plasma were collected in the mid-morning (0930-1130 hr) when activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the rat and control levels of corticosterone were low and were repeated in the afternoon (1400-1600 hr) when activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-arenal axis and levels of corticosterone were higher. At small doses (1 mg/kg) buspirone had a greater facilitating effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis than did diazepam. In addition, buspirone had a greater maximum facilitatory effect (477%) on levels of corticosterone than diazepam (345%). However, buspirone (ED50 = 8.6 mumol/kg) and diazepam (ED50 = 8.7 mumol/kg) were equipotent. Administration of 1 mg/kg of buspirone in the morning increased the combined 1/2 and 1 hr circulating levels of corticosterone 75% above control levels. Diazepam, at 1 mg/kg, did not produce any significant changes in levels of corticosterone. Large doses (10 mg/kg) of buspirone increased morning levels of corticosterone by 328% and diazepam increased levels of corticosterone by 265%. During the afternoon small doses of buspirone or diazepam did not significantly alter levels of corticosterone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Thirty-two patients meeting DSM-III criteria for social phobia entered a 1-year drug treatment with tranylcypromine in dosages between 40 and 60 mg/day. After exclusion of the early dropouts, improvement was rated as marked and moderate in 62% and 17% of the sample (N = 29), respectively. Alcohol abuse was associated with a poor outcome. Side effects were frequent and in some cases delayed the attainment of efficacious dosages until the third month of treatment. No serious adverse reactions occurred. The findings, relative to efficacy, are in accordance with a previous trial with phenelzine but need confirmation in double blind controlled studies.", 
    "63": "Effects of adjunctive clonidine (0.15 to 0.7 mg/day) on symptoms experienced during and for 4 weeks after gradual alprazolam discontinuation were observed in panic disorder patients after 6 weeks of successful treatment. Twelve of 14 entered patients were considered to have had a sufficient period of discontinuation (2 weeks) and clonidine administration (1 week) for effects to be assessed adequately. Nine of these 12 patients reached zero dose of alprazolam in 3 to 4 weeks. However, 10 of 12 patients experienced new withdrawal symptoms and 11 of 12 experienced recurrent panic attacks during tapering. Although a greater proportion of patients were successfully discontinued in a shorter time than in a previous nonclonidine trial, clonidine did not appear to have a specific effect on relapse or withdrawal. A placebo-controlled trial is needed to discriminate between possible contributions of clonidine and other factors (e.g., physician attitude, placebo effect of pill taking) to this improved outcome.", 
    "64": "The pre- and post-synaptic muscarinic receptors of the rat vas deferens are not M1 since the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine (PZ) has low affinity for both. On this basis both the pre- and post-synaptic actions of ACh in this preparation seem to be mediated via M2-like muscarinic receptors. The following experimental observations reveal that both responses are mediated by pharmacologically distinct muscarinic receptors. The rank order of potency displayed by 3 muscarinic antagonists (Atropine, N-methyl-scopolamine [NMS] and PZ) at each of these sites is different. Atropine and PZ are selective blockers of the post-synaptic smooth muscle muscarinic receptor. NMS is a selective antagonist of the pre-synaptic muscarinic receptor that facilitates norepinephrine's release. Finally, PZ and NMS are non-competitive and competitive antagonists, post- and pre-synaptically, respectively. The results suggest that the post-synaptic smooth muscle muscarinic receptor belongs to the M2B (or M3) subtypes. The pre-synaptic muscarinic receptor belongs to the M2A (or M2) subtypes or to a subclass of the M2B (or M3) muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "65": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the M-cholinoceptor subtype selectivity of pirenzepine in man. In parallel with effects on the heart rate and salivary flow, M-cholinoceptor subtype occupancy by antagonist present in plasma samples was detected in radioreceptor assays. Bovine cerebral cortex membranes labelled with 3H-pirenzepine (M1) and rat salivary gland membranes labelled with 3H-N-methylscopolamine (M2) were used in these in vitro assays. A half-maximal occupancy of M1-cholinoceptors in the in vitro assay of plasma samples was detected after 0.25 mg of pirenzepine i.v. The respective half-maximal M2-cholinoceptor occupancy was observed after 10 mg. Doses less than 3 mg decreased the heart rate by maximally 10.7 beats/min with an ED50 of about 0.1 mg. An increase in heart rate (relative to control values) was observed at doses greater than 10 mg. This bivalent dose-response relationship was also observed after beta-blockade. Salivary flow tended to increase at doses less than 1 mg and was half-maximally inhibited after 10 mg. Combining the in vitro and in vivo results, the typical antimuscarinic effects (tachycardia and inhibition of salivary flow) can be attributed to the blockade of M2-cholinoceptors, whereas the reduction of heart rate coincides with the blockade of the M1-subtype. With respect to the typical antimuscarinic effects, pirenzepine was 70-fold less potent than atropine; in contrast, with respect to the reduction of heart rate, pirenzepine was equipotent with atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "In order to hematologically characterize SART-stressed (repeated cold-stressed) animals, which are regarded as model animals of clinical dysautonomia, general hematological analyses were performed in mice subjected to various types of stress. SART-stressed mice showed significant increases in erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and specific gravity of whole blood, no change in leukocyte count and a marked decrease in platelet count. Among the above changes, the decreased platelet count was particularly characteristic of SART-stressed mice. Splenectomy failed to inhibit the SART stress-induced thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow megakaryocyte counts increased following the stress. The bleeding time of SART-stressed mice was more than double that of normal mice. Consecutive administrations of Neurotropin, a sedative analgesic, completely blocked the alterations in platelet count, megakaryocyte count and bleeding time in SART-stressed mice without producing any effect in unstressed mice. From the present results, it is suggested that SART-stressed mice may be characterized by thrombocytopenia, which is not attributable to enhanced function of the spleen or suppressed platelet production in the bone marrow. Moreover, Neurotropin appears to be effective for moderating SART stress.", 
    "67": "70 children aged between 15 months and 8 years who had to undergo outpatient surgery (adenotomy) were divided into two groups and given different premedication. Group A received Midazolam (0.15 mg/kg) combined with Piritramid (0.1 mg/kg), group B Thalamonal (0.04 ml/kg). Based on vigilance schemes, the degree of sedation and the mood tone were rated during initiation of anaesthesia, in the awakening phase and on discharge of the patient. Cooperation during initiation (via a mask) was definitely higher in group A (72%) than in group B (44%). During the awakening phase the children in group A showed a more balanced mood tone combined with improved vigilance. For example, 3 hours postoperatively 65% of the children in group A had got up and participated in getting dressed, whereas in group B only 11% of the children did so. Intramuscular premedication with Midazolam/Piritramid must be considered as especially advantageous in outpatient ENT treatment requiring a large number of small surgical interventions in children in respect of effective preparation and with a minimum of problems regarding postoperative follow-up.", 
    "68": "Oral premedication with benzodiazepines is well established in clinical anaesthesia. Appreciation of the specific pharmacodynamic profile of available drugs suggest individual prescription for certain groups of patients. We report a case of severe respiratory depression following oral premedication with flunitrazepam 1 mg in a patient with intracranial neoplasma. With respect to this complication and a review of the literature we suggest administration of short acting benzodiazepines with pronounced anxiolytic and moderate sedative properties (lormetazepam type) for neurosurgical patients.", 
    "69": "The effectiveness of midazolam and atropine as anaesthetic premedication was investigated, comparing rectal to intramuscular administration. A total of 202 children varying in age from 10 months to 9 years, who had been admitted to the Day Surgery Department for short ENT procedures, were assigned to one of two groups on a random basis. The first group (n = 102) was given 0.5 mg/kg midazolam and 0.05 mg/kg atropine as a rectal solution 30 to 75 min prior to induction, while the second group (n = 100) was given 0.15 mg/kg midazolam and 0.02 mg/kg atropine as an intramuscular injection 20 to 60 min prior to induction. The levels of sedation and salivation were compared, as was the degree of tolerance to intravenous induction. The parents of children older than 3 years of age were given a questionnaire designed to determine the degree of amnesia. We found this combination of drugs to be effective in the relief of anxiety, the inhibition of salivary secretion and the promotion of memory loss, regardless of the route of administration. We feel that rectal administration is preferable because it is not associated with pain or anxiety.", 
    "70": "The elimination pharmacokinetics of midazolam after i.m. administration was compared with combined i.m. and i.v. administration in a randomized study of 55 gynaecological patients in outpatient general anaesthesia. Group 1 (n = 40) received midazolam 0.1 mg/kg i.m. as premedication 45 min before induction of general anaesthesia with midazolam 0.3 mg/kg i.v. Group 2 (n = 15) received midazolam 0.1 mg/kg i.m. as premedication 45 min before induction of general anaesthesia with thiopentone 4 mg/kg. Serum midazolam concentration measurements were performed regularly post-induction for 7 h in each patient. The elimination half-life of midazolam after i.m. administration (Group 2) was 6.6 +/- 1.2 h (mean +/- s.e. mean), which was significantly longer (P less than 0.05) than the 3.9 +/- 0.3 h observed after the combined i.m. and i.v. administration of midazolam (Group 1), and significantly longer than 2.9 h obtained from a calculated i.v. administration curve. We postulate a slow i.m. depot release of midazolam, representing the rate-limiting step in the elimination of midazolam after i.m. administration.", 
    "71": "To verify the potential in vivo inhibitory effect on liver function of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), also known as cachectin, antipyrine and diazepam were chosen to probe the hepatic mixed-function oxidase system. A single dose of TNF (30 micrograms/kg) to rats significantly reduced the plasma clearance of antipyrine and diazepam by about 30% and 25%, respectively; this resulted in concomitant prolongation of the elimination half-life (t1/2) of the two drugs, although of borderline significance for the benzodiazepine. This was probably due to a decrease in hepatic cytochrome P-450 activities that are responsible for antipyrine and diazepam metabolism in TNF-treated rats. This could be of clinical relevance if a similar effect occurs in humans after therapeutically effective doses of this biological response modifier.", 
    "72": "To better define the role of muscarinic receptors in lung responses and airway diseases, we characterized the binding of the M1-specific antagonist, [3H]pirenzepine (PZ), and the nonspecific (M1- and M2-) antagonist, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), to human peripheral lung tissue. Data obtained from 15 different lung specimens showed that the radioligands bound to single high-affinity sites with dissociation constant (Kd) values ranging from 1 to 9 nM for [3H]PZ and 0.03 to 0.46 nM for [3H]QNB. Comparison of total binding capacity values by equilibrium experiments with [3H]PZ, unlabeled PZ, and [3H]QNB indicates that approximately one-half of the total muscarinic binding sites in human peripheral lung binds PZ with high affinity (putative M1-subtypes). Kd values for muscarinic agents determined by competition experiments with [3H]PZ were consistent with the expected rank order of potency for interactions with muscarinic receptors. Characterization of the role of these muscarinic receptor subtypes in human lung responses may lead to the development of more selective therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic obstructive airway diseases."
