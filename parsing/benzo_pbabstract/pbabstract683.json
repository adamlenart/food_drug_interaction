    "0": "Polygraphic recordings of EEG, EMG, EKG and respiration were made on three patients with histologically verified subacute spongiform encephalopathy and one patient with anoxic encephalopathy both before and after intravenous diazepam. The records showed cyclical activity occurring about every half minute in which the EEG changes were correlated with myoclonus and cardio-respiratory changes. It is suggested that these cycles represent spontaneous cycles of arousal to which the 1/sec sharp waves are related wnd which result from the same mechanisms that produce other cyclical autonomic phenomena.", 
    "1": "Two minor tranquilizers, diazepam and lorazepam were significantly better than a placebo preparation in relieving symptoms of functional gastrointestinal distress in 28 patients who took part in a double-blind cross-over trial. The beneficial therapeutic effect may be group- rather than preparation-specific. Both agents were also of significant benefit to the sub-group of patients with aerophagy as a major symptom.", 
    "2": "After oral medication of Faustan the EOG curve demonstrates: 1. a potential reduction throughout all 25 min of investigation; 2. an abnormal curve during dark time in several cases; 3. an inverse reaction in 7 persons.", 
    "3": "The effects of intramuscular injections of diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) and scopolamine (8 mug/kg) on memory processes and subjective moods were studied in 36 volunteers. Subjects (Ss) were tested in groups of four in a double blind procedure with treatments distributed according to a Latin square design. Lists of words were presented to Ss who were then tested with an immediate free recall test prior to drug administration. Following injection delayed free recall and recognition tests were given. Subsequently two sets of lists were presented separately and tested in the same fashion. Two of the lists in the last set were composed of words falling into distinct categories. Memory was additionally analyzed by testing immediate recall of digit sequences and employing a visual recognition test. Subjective moods were evaluated with a rating questionnaire. Both diazepam and scopolamine impaired memory functions although the action of the latter drug was more pronounced and prolonged. The deficit appeared to be in the storage process leaving retrieval processes unaffected. Scopolamine in addition interfered with organizational processes. Subjectively, scopolamine also produced a larger sedative effect than diazepam.", 
    "4": "The effect of diazepam on soman-induced bradycardia and respiratory depression in rabbits has been investigated. Diazepam prevents the bradycardia produced by soman in conscious rabbits. Although atropine will reverse the respiratory depression produced by soman in anesthetized rabbits, diazepam enhances the depression and renders rabbits less susceptible to this action of atropine.", 
    "5": "Rats continued to lever press for food when a bowl of free food was placed in the experimental chamber. Chlordiazepoxide increased the amount of free food consumed, and tended to reduce the amount of lever pressing. It is argued that the drug decreased container neophobia in the animals, rather than acting like an increase in food deprivation.", 
    "6": "The effectiveness of intraperitoneal phenobarbitone (4 mg/kg), pentobarbitone (6 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg) in preventing lignocaine-induced seizures was studied in rats. Although the barbiturates exerted a marked depressant action on wakefulness and gait of the rats, they were still associated with a very high incidence of convulsions and deaths following 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal lignocaine hydrochloride. Diazepam, however, even in doses (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) which did not produce marked sedation was able to completely prevent convulsions. Mortality was not completely prevented as one animal in each of the groups receiving these doses died without convulsing. Diazepam in the dose of 7.5 mg/kg completely prevented the seizures as well as the mortality but exerted a more profound effect on wakefulness and gait of the animals. The effectiveness of diazepam pretreatment in preventing lignocaine-induced seizures in rats is confirmed.", 
    "7": "We have demonstrated the toxicity of diazepam and the safety of ketamine hydrochloride following intra-arterial injection in an anaesthetized animal model. The pathogenesis of gangrene following intra-arterial injection of drugs is unclear. Clinical reports and this experiment suggest that it only follows injection of highly membrane-soluble drugs. Early swelling and disruption of capillary endothelial cells were demonstrated after intra-arterial injection of diazepam and thiopentone. We believe that a theory of pathogenesis based on this finding is consistent not only with our experimental findings, but with known in vitro effects of membrane soluble drugs on cell membranes and the clinical features following intra-arterial injections in both human subjects and in animals.", 
    "8": "Nine groups of rats of rats were either hypophysectomized, adrenalectomized or left unoperated. These groups were then subjected to daily increasing injections of either morphine HCL, sodium pentobarbital, chloridiazepoxide or saline. Hypophysectomy seemed to lower the lethal dose of the three drugs tested. Adrenalectomy seemed to have only a minimal effect on the lethal dose of morphine HCL or sodium pentobarbital.", 
    "9": "A specific, rapid, and sensitive GLC method for purity control of hexadiphane and its determination in pharmaceutical perparations is described. The method utilizes an extraction of the free base, followed by GLC on a 0.5% OV-17 column at isothermal temperature for 6 min and then the temperature was programmed. Results from this method and from a titrimetric method were compared, and no significant differences were found.", 
    "10": "The following abnormalities were observed during the first 24 hours of admission for 162 drug overdosage (OD) episodes in 152 patients: abnormal chest x-ray films; increased A-aO2 gradient; elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts; elevated serum enzyme levels; gross myoglobinuria; skin lesions suggestive of pressure necrosis; and abnormal electrocardiograms. Many sputum cultures were positive for single or multiple potentially pathogenic organisms. These correlations existed: all patients with OD duration of less than 12 hours were hyperthermic; as temperatures increased so did WBC counts; hyperthermic patients had higher creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values than those with hypothermia or normothermia; patients with skin lesions had higher temperatures and CPK values and longer OD duration; serum enzme levels increased with increasing OD duration; patients with CPK levels greater than 10,000 mU/ml had myoglobinuria; and patients with the most abnormal chest x-ray films had higher temperatures and larger A-aO2 gradients. Incidence of pneumonitis is low, even with abnormal chest radiograms, leukocytosis, hyperthermia, and positive sputum cultures. Abnormal temperatures and leukocytosis are probably secondary to stress, hypoxemia, acidosis, and specific drug ingestion rather than infection.", 
    "11": "The metabolic clearance rates (MCR) of methylprednisolone (MP) (no. = 13) and methylprednisolone-21- Na-hemisuccinate (MPHS) (no. = 6) were studied in normal humans using tritium-labeled steroids. The cumulative appearance of the labeled steroid was examined for the whole urine and for three major urinary fractions. The MCR, half-life, and volume of distribution were, respectively, 383 +/- 72 (SD) liters/day, 165 +/- 49 minutes, and 61 +/- 12 liters for MP, and 234 +/- 37, 160 +/- 19, and 41 +/- 6 for MPHS. Diphenylhydantoin (DPH) administered to 4 subjects increased the MCR of MP from 424 +/- 71 to 977 +/- 132 (P less than 0.01), and decreased the half-life from 149 +/- 44 to 69 +/- 7 (P less than 0.001). Similar effects were found with phenobarbital (PB). Diazepam (DZP) had no effect. Major increases in urinary metabolites after DPH and PB were in the unconjugated ethyl acetate fraction, and this suggests that MP metabolism is significantly altered by hepatic microsomal hydroxylation enzyme induction by DHP and PB, but not DZP. This could occur with the formation of a 6beta-hydroxy derivative which could be readily cleared by the kidney. The urinary pattern of excretion for MPHS was similar to that of MP. The MCR of MPHS was affected to a lesser extent by DPH and PB than was the MCR of MP(P less than 0.01). Therefore, the use of hepatic microsomal hydroxylase inducers should be taken into consideration in clinical states in which MP is being used.", 
    "12": "The influence of 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-5-phenyl 2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (oxazepam, Adumbran) (30 mg) on the effects produced by alcohol (0.75 g/kg) and vice versa was studied in 14 male test subjects using the following scheme: (A) alcohol; (B) placebo; (C) oxazepam; (D) oxazepam and alcohol combined; (E) alcohol given 30 min prior to oxazepam. Blood and serum levels were determined and excretion in the urine was tested during the 7-h duration of the experiment. The blood alcohol curves show a similar course, leading to the conclusion that oxazepam has no influence on the elimination of alcohol. Alcohol retrads the intestinal absorption of oxazepam but, on the other hand, does not show an effect on the specific metabolism of oxazepam.", 
    "13": "In 30 physically and mentally healthy volunteers, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-1-methyl-5-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (temazepam, K 3917) was tested for its sleep inducing action, the subjective quality of sleep and any post-medication effects. Temazepam was orally administered at doses of 15, 20 or 30 mg in hard gelatin capsules or 20 mg in soft gelatin capsules. Nitrazepam (5 mg) and amylobarbitone sodium (100 mg) were used for comparison as well as a placebo. Temazepam showed very much the same effects as they are known from conventional 1,4-benzodiazepines except for its lack of impairment in early morning behavior following night time medication.", 
    "14": "A double-blind study involving sixty-two patients, aged 65 years or over, treated for twenty-eight days, showed that fluphenazine 0-5 mg/nortriptyline 10 mg three times daily was superior to promazine 50 mg three times daily in relieving symptoms of anxiety and was associated with a lower incidence of side-effects. The results are discussed in the light of the nature of anxiety/depression syndromes in the elderly and it is suggested that since symptoms of anxiety in these disorders are often manifestations of an underlying depressive illness, the antidepressant effect of the nortriptyline may have enhanced the 'anxiolytic' advantage of fluphenazine/nortriptyline.", 
    "15": "As demonstrated by tests set up on rabbits, substances endowed with sedative properties empede habituation to an inadequate stimulation of the vestibular receptors, whereas stimulators facilitate it. When used in small doses imipramin acts as a psycho-stimulator and in large ones--as a tranquilizor.", 
    "16": "The authors performed 500 anesthesia with ketamine hydrochloride, 302 in children and 198 in adults. Its advantages are: -short term anesthesia, -no intubation. The disadvantages are minimal, and we had no accidents with this anesthetic.", 
    "17": "An analogue of the conditioned avoidance test, the conditioned approach test, was designed in which the reinforcing event was eating food rather than avoiding or escaping shock. A response to the approach stimulus resulted in immediate delivery of food. Failure to respond to the approach stimulus for 15 sec resulted in the delivery of a food pellet. Administration of chlorpormazine at 2--4 mg/kg, PO to squirrel monkeys resulted in the failure of the monkeys to respond to many approach stimuli although they promptly responded to the freely delivered food pellet. Diazepam was without effect at doses up to 100 mg/kg, PO.", 
    "18": "The management of a patient with seizures involves proper classification, etiologic evaluation, and administration of appropriate therapy. With proper evaluation and management, control of seizures can be expected in the majority of patients. The physician must realize that an epileptic adolescent has intrinsic anxieties and faces social, educational, and vocational restrictions. Failure to deal with these psychosocial problems may result in a greater handicap to the patient than the seizures themselves.", 
    "19": "The spasmolytic activity of six commonly used benzodiazepines was investigated on isolated guinea-pig ileum preparation. All six substances proved to be non-competitive antagonists of carbachol and barium chloride, the pD'2 values ranging between 3.23 and 4.37 in the presence of either agonist. The significance of these findings is discussed.", 
    "20": "Six benzodiazepine derivatives, given alone or in combination with amphetamine, were tested in mice subjected to five 100-trial avoidance sessions in the shuttle-box. All derivatives, execpt bromazepam, showed some facilitating effects on avoidance responding when given alone. Facilitation was particularly evident following the administration of chlordiazepoxide (2.5 mg/kg), medazepam (10 mg/kg) and nitrazepam (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg). Favourable effects were obtained by combining each benzodiazepine compound with amphetamine. The levels of avoidance respinses were usually higher under benzodiazepine-amphetamine combinations than under benzodiazepines alone.", 
    "21": "The biotransformation of 14C-triflubazam (ORF 8063; 1-methyl-5-phenyl-7-trifluoromethyl-1H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-4-[3H,5H]-dione) was investigated in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Urinary metabolites, representing 65, 74, and 87%, respectively, of the total urinary radioactivity excreted by these three species, were isolated by preparative layer chromatography and characterized by various spectral techniques including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, solid probe mass spectrometry, polarimetry, and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. No parent drug was found in the urine of any species. Four metabolites were isolated from the rat including the 4'-hydroxyphenyl, dihydrodiol, and 3'-methoxy-4'hydroxy derivatives. N-demethylated metabolites were not isolated from rat urine. Five metabolites were isolated from dog urine, including 4-hydroxyphenyl, dihydrodiol, and catechol derivatives of triflubazam. Unlike the case of the rat, a catechol-O-methyl ether was not detected in dog urine. Six metabolites were isolated from monkey urine. The only major difference in metabolism in the monkey was the existence of both the dihydrodiol and N-desmethyldihydrodiol metabolites. No catechol-0-methyl ether was detected in monkey urine. Biotransformation through a common arene oxide intermediate can be proposed for these three animal species.", 
    "22": "Lorazepam (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg) was compared with pentobarbital (60 and 180 mg) for its effect on sleep in \"hospital insomnia.\" Subjective-response data were collected by research nurses. Lorazepam was found to be a potent nighttime sedative: 1 to 1.25 mg of lorazepam is equivalent to 100 mg sodium pentobarbital for measures of sleep quality and duration. At this dose level it is less effective than 100 mg of pentobarbital as a sleep inducer. Studies at higher doses (up to 4 mg) indicate that lorazepam has a wide therapeutic index.", 
    "23": "Timing behaviour was generated in rats by a schedule which required responses to be spaced at least 15 sec apart in order for them to produce food reinforcement (DRL 15 sec). The behaviour maintained by this schedule was then studied after administration of chlordiazepoxide, phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine. Several doses of both chlordiazepoxide and phenobarbitone were found to disrupt timing behaviour by increasing overall response rates although the highest dose of each of these two drugs produced sedative effects. Chlorpromazine produced mainly a decrease in overall response rates. Analysis of performance in terms of interresponse times (IRTs) showed that both chlordiazepoxide and phenobarbitone markedly increased the percentage of IRTs less than 1.5 sec in duration (response bursts). Chlorpromazine had no consistent effect on response bursts. Reduction of the animals' body weights from 85% to 75% of their preexperimental levels had no effect on operant performance, suggesting that the effects of the drugs were probably not due to actions on motivational processes.", 
    "24": "This study examined the effects on smooth-pursuit eye tracking of single doses of CPZ (0.667 and 1.334 mg/kg), diazepam (0.071, 0.142, and 0.284 mg/kg), and secobarbital (100 mg). Only the barbiturate significantly affected the ability to follow a moving target with smooth-pursuit eye movements. In repeated testing of a single subject, 130 mg of secobarbital disrupted smooth-pursuit movements at least until 24 hrs after ingestion.", 
    "25": "Forty paid healthy male students participated in two subacute experiments of 6 weeks each. In the first trial 20 of them received bromazepam, thioridazine, and placebo double blind cross over for 2 weeks each, and in the second trial the active agents administered to the other 20 participants were chlorpromazine and sulpiride. The tests used were paired associate learning with nonsense syllables and digit memory span. Before testing the subjects took either an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic bitter drink. As in the previous study from this laboratory, alcohol was found to impair learning capacity. Of the drugs used only bromazepam impaired learning significantly, and the combined effect of alcohol and bromazepam on learning capacity was very deleterious. The adrenolytic effect of drugs did not correlate with their effect on learning. Caution is necessary when prescribing bromazepam for active outpatients at least in doses used in this study.", 
    "26": "The effects of new thienodiazepine derivatives, such as clotiazepam and Y-7131, on normal human sleep were investigated on 5 subjects and compared to those of benzodiazepine derivatives, such as diazepam and nitrazepam. REM sleep was significantly decreased only with 2 mg of Y-7131 and rebound elevation of REM sleep did not follow in recovery 1 and 2 nights. By using partial differential REM deprivation which was designed by us, there was also no rebound elevation of REM sleep noted in recovery 2 nights following 2 mg of Y-7131 medication. REM sleep was not suppressed with 15 mg of clotiazepam, 6 mg of diazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam when compared to the baseline night. With regard to NREM sleep, stage 2 was significantly increased with 15 mg of clotiazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam, but stage SWS was significantly decreased with 10 mg of nitrazepam.", 
    "27": "A comparative trial of nitrazepam, and triazolam (U-33,030) as pre-anaesthetic medicaments in patients allegedly not subject to insomnia, was undertaken the night before operation. The inclusion of placebo controls confirmed earlier findings that the majority of these patients suffer from transient insomnia. Nitrazepam and flurazepam are hypnotics, and in this study, triazolam also proved to be an hypnotic remarkably free of adverse effects.", 
    "28": "Preliminary clinical results with an association of high doses of vincamine and chlordiazepoxide in subjects with recurrent depression are presented. It is felt that vincamine has a clinically appreciable psychoactive action.", 
    "29": "When effects of di-n-propylacetate (nDPA) on various patterns of behaviour in mice in \"novel environment\" tests are compared with the effects of oxazepam, it appears that the stimulating action of nDPA is more evident than its antianxiety effects. Learning seems to be facilitated by this stimulating action.", 
    "30": "There are many difficulties in evaluating the efficacy of anxiolytic drugs, but their widespread and increasing clinical use confirms their effectiveness. The benzodiazepines, the most popular agents, offer certain advantages over the others. This article summarises the chemical properties and clinical effects of the benzodiazepines, and propose guidelines for the rational use of these agents in clinical practice.", 
    "31": "The effects of flunitrazepam (0.03 mg/kg administered intravenously over a two-minute period) was investigated in 11 healthy volunteers with normal pulmonary function. Spirometer tracings were recorded continuously by the Siregnost FD 40 and blood gas measurements were performed by the Harnoncourt AVL gas analyzer. Flunitrazepam produced a characteristic cyclical hypoventilation/hyperventilation pattern lasting 15 min., followed by quiet sleeping rhythms. The duration of action was 20 min. There was a significant fall in PCO2, whilst the CO2 tension showed a significant rise. Changes in pH were in accordance with respiratory acidosis. Apnoea did not occur after the administration of flunitrazepam.", 
    "32": "Chlordiazepoxide HCl, at dose levels from 2.5 mg/kg to 80 mg/kg, significantly increased the low base rates of mouse killing (3-9%) observed in large samples (N = 100/dose) of Holtzman strain albino male rats. Maximal killing rates were obtained at doses from 7.5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. Diazepam was equally effective, and several times more potent than chlordiazepoxide. Pentobarbital did not increase killing. Killing induced by chlordiazepoxide was blocked by d-amphetamine SO4, but not by l-amphetamine, at dose levels similar to those that block undrugged killing in this strain (ED50 = 1.5 mg/kg). Unlike pilocarpine-induced killing, the effects of chlordiazepoxide were not increased or decreased significantly by either peripherally or centrally active anticholinergic drugs, over wide dose ranges of these agents; nor were the effects of chlordiazepoxide increased by repeated daily administration.", 
    "33": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on emergence behavior was examined in socially reared and isolation reared rats. It was found that low doses of CDP decreased the emergence times of isolated animals but had little effect on the emergence of social animals. At higher doses the drug retarded emergence in all groups but there were no differential effects. The results do not support claims that rearing conditions influence the susceptability of rats to CNS depressants, rather they suggest that particular levels of CDP selectively influence \"emotional\" behavior.", 
    "34": "A comparison of the behavioural effects of response-contingent and noncontingent shock was carried out in a series of experiments examining (a) suppression of an operant response (lever-pressing); (b) release from suppression following injection of the minor tranquilizer chlordiazepoxide, and (c) suppression of behaviour in a situation not associated with shock. The major findings were that response-contingent shock produced far greater suppression of the operant response than did noncontingent shock, as well as greater suppression of behaviour in a neutral environment following the shock experience. Chlordiazepoxide was found to be far more effective in releasing behaviour from suppression when shock was response-contingent than when shock was noncontingent, a result which does not appear to reflect simply the greater suppression produced by response-contingent shock. A discussion of methodology and interpretations in this field, suggests why discrpancies have arisen in the past.", 
    "35": "Ten healthy male subjects received diazepam (10 or 20 mg), fentanyl (0.1 or 0.2 mg) or a placebo intravenously at weekly intervals according to a latin square design. They were tested on a battery of psychological and electroencephalographic tests at 0.5, 2, 6, and 8 hrs following injection. Fentanyl had little effect on memory while diazepam reduced the ability to learn without increasing forgetting of material alread acquired. By the 2nd hour post injection, only the low dose of fentanyl had no residual effect. Recovery was complete by the 6th hour for all treatments according to the psychological tests except for the lagging effect of high dose of diazepam on memory. The electroencephalographic effects of diazepam persisted beyond the end of the testing sessions while those of the high dose of fentanyl recovered by the 8th hour. Thus in the dosages tested, diazepam had more intense and prolonged effects than fentanyl.", 
    "36": "The determination of various 1,4-benzodiazepines and their metabolites by differential pulse polarography is reviewed and compared with that by other methods, and the general applicability of the polarographic methods, in terms of simplicity and flexibility, is demonstrated.", 
    "37": "The content of noradrenaline during the action of antidepressant imipramine and a tranquilizer diazepam was determined in rats by differential centrifugation of the hypothalamus tissues. Imipramine was found to decrease the noradrenaline content in synaptosomes, whereas diazepam failed to evoke any similar effects. Thus, in the action mechanism of the first substance the adrenergic compound was of definite importance, while in the mechanism of the second one it took no part.", 
    "38": "The effect of an acute oral dose of ethanol (3 g/kg), administered 30 min prior to oral administration of 14C-diazepam (5 mg/kg), on the fate of radioactivity in rats was examined. Ethanol pretreated rats possessed higher tissue levels at 60, 90 and 120 min than control animals. Blood, liver, kidney and plasma tissues showed 1.5 fold differences, adipose tissue exhibited a 2.4 to 3.6-fold increase, with brain showing 3.9, 4.5 and 5.4 fold higher levels of 14C at 60, 90 and 120 min respectively. Octanol extraction of plasma and ethyl acetate extraction of brain tissues indicated ethanol pretreated animals possessed a higher percentage of extractable radioactivity than controls. Thin-layer chromatography of the extracts suggested that biotransformation of 14C-diazepam was inhibited by ethanol, causing brain levels of 14C-diazepam at 60 min to be 6.4 fold higher than that observed in controls.", 
    "39": "1. A gas chromatographic-mass fragmentographic method has been developed to determine piribedil and its metabolite S-584, using diazepam as internal standard. The metabolite was derivatized as a trimethylsilyl ether for gas chromatographic analysis. The minimum detectable amount of piribedil and the metabolite was 10 ng/g tissue. 2. Levels of piribedil and its metabolite in the striatum were determined by mass fragmentography.", 
    "40": "Diazepam decreased the rate and amplitude of contraction in isolated embryonic chick hearts in a dose-dependent manner in both the noninnervated hearts obtained from 4-day-old embryos and the innervated hearts from 7-day-old embryos. The concentration of diazepam necessary to reduce the heart rate and contractile amplitude to 50% of the control values was about 1 X 10(-4) M. Concentrations less than 1.0 X 10(-5) M had no detectable depressant effects. Prior administration of atropine did not alter the depression induced by diazepam. Norepinephrine was able to stimulate the amplitude of contraction in the diazepam-depressed heart while atropine was without effect. The vehicle used in the clinical injectable preparation of diazepam had no depressant effects. The mechanism of action of the diazepam-induced depression on the isolated embryonic chick heart may be a direct depression of the myocardium.", 
    "41": "The circumstances leading to forced landing of a three-seat light cabin monoplane due to engine failure are described. The pilot, an airline pilot employed as a Boeing 707 captain, and one of the two passengers were killed. The liver of the pilot showed diffuse fatty changes and toxicological examination revealed a blood alcohol concentration of 149 mg/100 ml and 139 mg/100 ml in the urine. On initial screening for drugs, the presence of nitrazepam or chlordiazepoxide was suspected and the medical investigation was further complicated by the finding of chlordiazepoxide in the personal effects. Although the cause of the accident was a stall at low altitude during an attempted forced landing following loss of engine power, it was concluded that the pilot's ability to avoid onset of stall was impaired by the concentration of alcohol in his system.", 
    "42": "A 12-year-old female Bengal tiger was presented with clinical signs of acute chlorinated hydrocarbon poisoning and a history of recent consumption of food contaminated with toxaphene. Hyperreflexia and periodic convulsions were controlled by initial intramuscular injections of 30 mg diazepam and 2 g methocarbamol, followed at 6-hour intervals with intramuscular injections of 30 mg diazepam each, for 2 additional treatments. Following the initial treatment, hyperreflexia and convulsions did not recur.", 
    "43": "The effect of intravenous diazepam on glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance) and effective renal plasma flow (PAH clearance) was investigated in 6 children and 12 anesthetized rabbits. A transient decrease in inulin and PAH clearances was observed in 6 children given 4 mg of diazepam intravenously, without measurable change in blood pressure. A similar renal effect was observed in anesthetized rabbits, together with a transient drop in systemic arterial pressure. Continuous infusion of diazepam (5 mg/kg/hr) did not affect renal function in rabbits. We suggest that this effect of diazepam should be borne in mind when the drug is administered to patients undergoing renal clearance studies or to patients with preexistent renal insufficiency.", 
    "44": "A series of 4-alkyl-8,9-dihydro[1]benzazepino[3,2,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-1(2H)-ones and brominated derivatives was synthesized. Two approaches for the synthesis of 4-alkyl[1]benzazepino[3,2,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-1(2H)-ones and brominated derivatives are described. All compounds were evaluated for CNS activity. None showed significant activity. The results obtained indicate that in the case of the 1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one a phenyl group at the 1 position causes a fall in CNS activity not only when it is free but also when fused to the benzodiazepine system.", 
    "45": "Forty male volunteers over the age of 60 took either a daily dose of diazepam (12 mg) or placebo for a two-week period. Differential responses to these compounds partially depended upon age and the initial symptom level. Diazepam produced sedative side effects, a modest antidepressant effect, and a reduction in memory. Placebo had an antianxiety effect in the relatively older subjects, and was associated with decreased fatique, improved memory and improved motor function. Considerable variability was observed in both drug and placebo responses among the elderly. A self-rating depression scale (D30R) was useful for assessing changes in affective states and in discriminating between the effects of active drug and placebo."
