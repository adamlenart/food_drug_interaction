    "0": "We report the synthesis and binding activity to the central benzodiazepine receptors of some 2,3-dihydro-2-aryl-4-R-[1]benzopyrano[4,3-c]pyrazole-3-ones, which are isosteres of the CGS series. Although the compounds of the CGS series are potent ligands of the benzodiazepine receptors, none of the isosteres tested showed any significant inhibiting potency. This may be due to the change in electronic properties brought about by the replacement of the NH of the CGS series with an oxygen atom.", 
    "1": "The effects of phencyclidine (PCP) and a number of PCP-like drugs on punished responding in rats were compared to those of chlordiazepoxide and morphine. Twenty rats, trained to lever-press for food reinforcement, were tested under a modified Geller-Seifter procedure using a multiple schedule with responding in one component reinforced under a fixed-interval 60-sec schedule while each response in the other component resulted in both food and brief electric shock presentation. Chlordiazepoxide, PCP, etoxadrol, (+)-N-allylnormetazocine and (-)-beta-cyclazocine all resulted in selective increases in rates of responding during the punishment component. Two drugs with predominant opiate-agonist actions in vivo, (-)-alpha-cyclazocine and morphine, did not increase punished responding at any dose tested. These results confirm previous research using pigeons that had shown antipunishment effects of PCP and provide further evidence for an overlap in the pharmacology of PCP-like drugs and depressant drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines. The concordance between the discriminative stimulus properties and antipunishment effects of PCP-like drugs and actions at the PCP receptor suggests that the PCP receptor may play a role in both behavioral actions of this group of drugs.", 
    "2": "The steroid anesthetic alphaxalone and a series of naturally occurring analogs were compared in potency and efficacy with each other and the hypnotic barbiturate pentobarbital for interaction with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors:binding sites in rat brain membranes and functional activity in 36Cl- flux measurements with rat hippocampal slices. The steroids enhanced [3H]muscimol binding to GABA receptor sites, enhanced [3H] flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors and inhibited [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate binding to picrotoxin/convulsant binding sites on the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex. The same steroids that were active in modulating the binding of ligands to the various receptor sites on the GABA receptor complex at micromolar concentrations enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- flux in rat hippocampal slices. The steroids, like the barbiturates, increased the maximal response to muscimol but produced little or no potentiation of basal 36Cl- flux in the absence of GABA agonist. Although the effects of steroids and barbiturates were similar, separate sites of action were demonstrated conclusively by the observation that the two classes of compounds, when included together, gave additive or synergistic effects on binding, as well as on 36Cl- flux in the absence of GABA agonist. Structure-activity studies showed that the synthetic steroid anesthetic alphaxalone was the most potent compound tested, followed by the naturally occurring steroids tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone, allo-tetrahydrocorticosterone, cis-androsterone and 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one. The ability of several naturally occurring steroids to enhance GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain suggests the possibility of an endogenous steroid modulator of neuronal function.", 
    "3": "Chronic administration of a benzodiazepine agonist appears to downregulate benzodiazepine receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor function. To examine the effects of chronic treatment with a benzodiazepine antagonist, we administered Ro15-1788, 1, 2 and 5 mg/kg/day to mice via implanted s.c. osmotic pumps for 1 to 14 days. Plasma and cortex (CX) concentrations of Ro15-1788 remained constant between days 1 and 7, indicating no change in pharmacokinetics. Open-field activity studies showed no change in distance traveled or ambulatory time at days 1, 2 and 4, but an increase in both parameters at days 7 and 14 in mice receiving Ro15-1788, 2 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was unchanged in CX, cerebellum (CB), hypothalamus, hippocampus and ponsmedulla at 1, 2 and 4 days at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Binding was increased in CX, CB and hippocampus at day 7 compared to days 1 and 2, and remained elevated at day 14. Similar results were observed at Ro15-1788 doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine binding assessed in vitro in CX and CB also was increased at day 7 compared to day 1, due to an increase in receptor number rather than a change in apparent affinity. Binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the chloride channel site in CX after Ro15-1788, 2 mg/kg/day, was increased at days 7 and 14 compared to days 1, 2 and 4 and controls due to an increase in number of binding sites. t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in CB was unchanged throughout.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "CD-1 mice were treated with caffeine-sodium benzoate solution (caffeine doses: 0, 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg i.p.) to determine plasma and brain concentrations, effects on benzodiazepine receptor binding based on specific uptake of a high affinity ligand, and locomotor activity. There was a linear relationship between caffeine dose and mean brain or plasma concentrations, but concentrations varied considerably at any given dose. There were also linear relationships between plasma and brain concentrations of caffeine and each metabolite, with caffeine itself having the greatest brain:plasma uptake ratio. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was determined based on uptake of the benzodiazepine receptor ligand [3H]Ro15-1788, 3 microCi i.v. given 40 min after caffeine (30 mg/kg). Nonspecific binding was measured in animals pretreated with saturating doses of clonazepam. Specific uptake (measured by subtracting nonspecific from total [3H] Ro15-1788 uptake) increased significantly with caffeine as opposed to vehicle treatment in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Brain caffeine concentrations associated with enhanced uptake were between 11 to 17 micrograms/g. Total locomotor activity and activity at 60 min, measured by an infrared sensor system, increased progressively with brain caffeine concentrations when comparing the following groups: 0, 2 to 9 micrograms/g of brain and 9 to 20 micrograms/g. Animals with brain concentrations exceeding 20 micrograms/g showed a decline in both measures but activity was significantly greater than placebo. In conclusion, brain caffeine concentrations between 9 to 20 micrograms/g are associated with increases in specific ligand uptake and motor activity.", 
    "5": "The effects of bilateral microinjections of chlordiazepoxide and GABA into the central amygdalar nucleus on gastric ulcer formation induced by cold-restraint were examined in chronically implanted Wistar rats. Higher doses of chlordiazepoxide (20 and 30 micrograms/amygdala) significantly reduced stress ulcer development, whereas a lower dose (2.5 micrograms) produced a nonsignificant increase in ulcer severity. A similar dose/response pattern was observed following GABA administration. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15-1788, applied to the amygdala, abolished the protective effects of both chlordiazepoxide and GABA. In addition, when Ro15-1788 (10 micrograms) was injected into the amygdala by itself, it aggravated the gastric stress pathology. However, a lower dose (5 micrograms) had an attenuating effect, opposite to the pattern of effects produced by chlordiazepoxide and GABA. The role of the amygdalar GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in stressful conditions is discussed.", 
    "6": "Aflatrem, a mycotoxin from Aspergillus flavus, potentiates the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced chloride current. This positive allosteric regulatory action of aflatrem was quantitatively studied on the GABAA receptor channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes after injection with chick brain mRNA under voltage-clamp conditions. In this model system, aflatrem potentiates the current induced by 5 microM GABA in a concentration-dependent manner. Half-maximal potentiation was obtained with 2.4 microM aflatrem and maximal stimulation of the GABA (5 microM) response was more than 10-fold. The potentiation was not associated with a change of the reversal potential of the GABA-induced current. In the presence of 2 microM aflatrem, the GABA dose-response curve shifted to lower concentrations, with the Ka decreasing from 28 to 7 microM and the Hill coefficient, n, from 1.5 to 0.8, as measured at a membrane potential of -100 mV. At saturating concentration of GABA (250 microM), aflatrem (10 microM) was still able to enhance the current by about 21%. Further experiments suggest that the site of action of aflatrem on the GABAA receptor channel complex is different from that of benzodiazepines, pentobarbital, and picrotoxin. Aflatrem (10 microM) had no significant effect on the coexpressed voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels and on the kainate channel. The potentiating action of aflatrem on the GABAA receptor channel may explain the initial symptoms of intoxication caused by aflatrem in vivo, i.e., diminished activity or immobility of the affected animal.", 
    "7": "The affinity of 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) for 11 neurotransmitter receptor binding sites was determined in human brain membranes. mCPP is essentially equipotent at all 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes (IC50 values ranging from 360 to 1300 nM). The drug displays similar affinity (IC50 = 570 nM for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors labeled for 3H-rauwolscine. mCPP is less potent at alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (IC50 values 2500-24,000 nM). mCPP is inactive at both benzodiazepine receptors and the 5-HT uptake sites at concentrations below 100,000 nM. These data demonstrate that mCPP displays similar potency for multiple neurotransmitter receptor binding sites in human brain.", 
    "8": "Synthetic n-butyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, an endogenous central benzodiazepine receptor inhibitor found in brain, was tritium-labeled from the butenyl ester. Binding of this [3H]beta-carboline was concentrated particularly in the synaptosomal membrane fraction of the cerebral cortex; this fraction showed a single type of high-affinity site (KD = 2.7 +/- 0.1 nM) with a Bmax of 1.16 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg of protein. The number of sites labeled was about half of that obtained with [3H]flunitrazepam binding (Bmax = 2.36 +/- 0.06 pmol/mg of protein). On the other hand, in the cerebellum, both ligands bound to practically the same number of sites. When [3H]flunitrazepam binding was done in the presence of 10(-11)-10(-5) M butyl beta-carboline, the differences between the two brain regions were more apparent. In cerebellar membranes the data fitted a straight line in the Eadie-Hofstee plot; this finding and a Hill number near unity suggest a single type of binding site. In the cortical membranes the data of binding fitted a concave curve, and the Hill number was 0.6. These are characteristics of two types of binding sites with different affinities (KD1 = 0.6-1.5 nM and KD2 = 12-18 nM). The differentiation of a high- and low-affinity site in the cerebral cortex was corroborated by experiments in which [3H]butyl beta-carboline binding was displaced by the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872. These results demonstrate that in the cerebral cortex there are two subtypes of sites (1 and 2) of central benzodiazepine receptors and that CL 218,872 binds preferentially to subtype 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "A double-blind controlled study comparing moclobemide and diazepam in patients with atypical depression was carried out. Statistical comparison of the 14 pairs completing 4 weeks showed that significant reductions in depressive symptomatology as measured by the Hamilton and Carroll depression rating scales occurred in both drug groups, and that diazepam was significantly better than moclobemide. A separate analysis of the 10 pairs completing 8 weeks treatment showed that significant decreases in depression ratings occurred in both drug groups but that by week 8 there was no significant difference between the two drugs for depression scores. Side-effects were minimal, and the most common side-effects emerging for both drugs were sleep disturbance and physical tiredness.", 
    "10": "Since one of the first measurable events that occurs as a consequence of receptor-mediated cell activation is an increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration, the calcium-selective fluorescent indicator fura-2 was employed to monitor increases in cytosolic calcium following PAF-acether stimulation of human neutrophils and platelets. In neutrophils, approximately 70% of the increase in cytosolic calcium was attributed to release from an intracellular source and 30% could be attributed to enhanced influx through the plasma membrane. In platelets, only 30% was released from an intracellular pool and the remainder reflected enhanced influx of calcium. In both cell types, the intracellular source of calcium was a non-mitochondrial, vesicular compartment, probably endoplasmic reticulum. The ability of different compounds to antagonize the PAF-acether-induced increase in cytosolic calcium was investigated using quin2 and fura-2 as calcium indicators. In decreasing order of potency, the following PAF-acether antagonists inhibited the change in platelet cytosolic free calcium elicited by 10 nM PAF-acether: L-652,731, kadsurenone, triazolam, diltiazem and alprazolam. L-652,731, kadsurenone, triazolam and diltiazem were also tested in neutrophils stimulated by 10 nM PAF-acether. While the antagonists were 7-20 times less active in neutrophils as compared to platelets, they all inhibited the rise in free calcium with the same order of potency in both cell types. Each of the antagonists was PAF-acether-specific, inhibited both the rate and magnitude of calcium mobilization and appeared to exhibit competitive antagonism. These data demonstrate that calcium mobilization can provide a rapid, sensitive and quantitative method by which to evaluate agonists such as PAF-acether and PAF-acether antagonists such as kadsurenone in different cell types.", 
    "11": "Flumazenil is an imidazobenzodiazepine that binds specifically to the central benzodiazepine receptor and antagonizes the actions of diazepam and other benzodiazepines. Previous studies in Europe have shown flumazenil at doses of 2 to 30 mg IV to reverse sedation in patients sedated with flunitrazepam, midazolam, and diazepam when evaluated by subjective criteria. The purpose of this study was to determine if flumazenil at 0.015 mg/kg IV was efficacious in shortening the recovery time of young, healthy dental patients sedated with diazepam (0.15 mg/kg IV) and restoring their psychomotor function to presedation levels. A total of 21 patients were randomized to placebo or flumazenil, sedated with diazepam, underwent a restorative dental procedure, and were then administered the test drug. Evaluations of psychomotor function by the Trieger test, Digit-Symbol Substitution test, Romberg test, and nurse questioning were carried out before sedation and at 10-minute intervals after test drug. Observations by the patients and nurses were not significantly different before versus after test drug. The investigator, however, found that flumazenil resulted in more rapid awakening. Patients treated with placebo exhibited significantly greater deficits in the number of dots missed and sum of deviations on the Trieger test than flumazenil-treated patients. Similar time-related deficits were recorded for the Digit-Symbol Substitution test. Flumazenil, at a dose of 0.015 mg/kg, was found to be efficacious in reducing the recovery time after diazepam sedation in dental patients.", 
    "12": "Flumazenil (Anexate), a new benzodiazepine antagonist, was administered in doses of 0.2-0.4 mg to 40 patients for reversing the sedative effects of midazolam used as the sole induction agent in doses of 0.15-0.25 mg x kg-1 for short operations with a mean duration of 35 +/- 10 min. Five min after flumazenil was given, 33 patients (82.5%) were fully conscious, while 38 patients (95%) were able to converse 30 min after administration. Flumazenil was very well tolerated in almost all cases, the only side effects being mild confusion in 3 patients and nausea in 3 other cases.", 
    "13": "EGYT 3886 (dia(-)2-phenyl-2-(dimethylamino-ethoxy) - 1R - 1,7,7-trimethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1.]heptane hemifumarate) exhibiting anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties is inactive on various binding sites of the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid A) receptor/chloride ionophore complex, but is an effective inhibitor of high-affinity synaptosomal 3H-GABA uptake.", 
    "14": "New drugs like alfentanil and midazolam have the primary advantage of metabolizing faster than existing compounds in their class. Because of shorter plasma half-lives, the drugs are well suited for continuous infusion. In our hands, CACI is a valuable clinical instrument and research tool. Although some anesthetic drugs can be given safely and effectively by bolus injection, whenever a titrated continuous infusion is appropriate (and physiologically closed-loop delivery is not possible), use of a CACI-type instrument should be the preferred method of administration. With the availability for continuous infusion of alfentanil and midazolam, with their highly desirable pharmacodynamic properties and relatively effervescent pharmacokinetics, we believe that computerized pharmacokinetic model-driven infusion devices will play a significant role in future anesthetic practice.", 
    "15": "We reported the case of a 13-year-old anorectic girl with epileptic seizures who showed marked favorable responses to sodium valproate and clonazepam. These two anticonvulsants were effective not only for controlling her epileptic seizures, but also against anorexia nervosa itself. The mechanism of their action to anorexia nervosa is unknown, but repeated EEGs and a trial of sodium valproate with or without clonazepam may be useful in evaluating the diverse pathologies of anorexia nervosa which seems to be a heterogeneous clinical entity.", 
    "16": "We describe a case of grand mal generalized tonic-clonic seizure after fluorescein angiography. The patient had a history of seizure disorders and had been controlled with proper medication before the test. We advocate the need to include diazepam and phenytoin in the list of emergency medications needed to control adverse reactions of fluorescein angiography.", 
    "17": "We investigated the therapeutic effect of flumanezil on acute and chronic hepatic encephalopathy in a group of cirrhotics; its efficacy was evaluated using clinical data and neurophysiologic examination, e.g. brain mapping. Flumazenil was not found to induce significant changes in the clinical status or in maps of the cerebral activity of patients with chronic encephalopathy. In acute encephalopathy, flumazenil improved clinical status, as was confirmed neurophysiologically by improved cerebral activity on brain mapping.", 
    "18": "Chloroquine, monodesethylchloroquine, diazepam, and nordiazepam levels are simultaneously determined in whole blood or plasma by HPLC. Papaverine is used as internal standard, and the analysis is performed after protein-binding hydrolysis, absorption on Extrelut, and elution with diethyl ether/methylene chloride (70:30 v/v). UV detection is used at 343 nm for 12 min, then changed to 242 nm. There are two mobile phases with two flow rates. The procedure requires 30 min, is reproducible, sensitive (8-10 ng/mL for chloroquine and its metabolite, 4 ng/mL for diazepam and nordiazepam), and selective, especially towards other antimalarial agents and drugs like adrenaline or barbiturates, which may be used in chloroquine poisoning therapy. It can be used for pharmacokinetic studies, therapeutic control, to establish the diagnosis and prognosis of a chloroquine poisoning, and to follow and optimize treatment.", 
    "19": "The muscarinic receptor present on the guinea-pig uterus has been characterized by use of both functional and radioligand binding studies. The contractile responses to carbachol were antagonized by atropine, pirenzepine, methoctramine and hexamethonium with pA2 values consistent with the presence of an M2 receptor (i.e. 9.5, 7.0, 8.0 and 3.7 respectively). In binding studies, pKi values were also observed for pirenzepine, methoctramine and AF-DX 116 which were consistent with the presence of a homogeneous M2 receptor population (i.e. 6.6, 7.9 and 7.1 respectively). The uterus therefore possesses M2 receptors through which a functional contractile response is mediated and in this respect it is clearly different from other smooth muscles. M2 receptors in the uterus mediate excitatory responses, an effect in contrast to their action in other tissues.", 
    "20": "The muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (105 mM) dramatically decreased the response to increased CO2 when applied by cotton pledgets to the rostral ventrolateral medulla ventilatory chemosensitive area in anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized, glomectomized, and servoventilated cats with integrated phrenic nerve activity used as respiratory center output. Lower dose atropine (4.4 mM) and the M1-muscarinic receptor subtype antagonist pirenzepine (10 mM) also significantly decreased the mean CO2 response slope 48.3 +/- 6.2 and 40.7 +/- 6.0% (SE), respectively, and significantly decreased the maximum response value 26.3 +/- 8.1 and 19.2 +/- 3.2%, respectively, without significant effects on blood pressure or on the phrenic response to carotid sinus nerve stimulation. The M2-muscarinic receptor subtype antagonist AF-DX 116 (10 mM) had no significant effect on phrenic output or blood pressure. Application of carbachol (10 mM) at the rostral area augmented eucapnic phrenic output and the maximum value of the CO2 response but decreased the initial slope, effects blocked by atropine. Carbachol also decreased the response to carotid sinus nerve stimulation, suggesting that the system was saturated by carbachol stimulation. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors accessible to surface application at the rostral ventrolateral medulla antagonized by pirenzepine but not AF-DX 116 appear to be involved in the central chemoreceptor process.", 
    "21": "Various anticonvulsant medications may have efficacy in the treatment of certain anxiety states as well as withdrawal syndromes occurring after the discontinuation of sedative-hypnotic drugs and alcohol. Preclinical studies and limited anecdotal evidence suggest that valproate may be more effective in controlling panic than carbamazepine. In small studies valproate and carbamazepine have been shown as possible effective agents in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Some treatment-resistant patients with panic disorder may respond well to trials of certain anticonvulsants. It is also possible that some patients in the heterogeneous generalized anxiety disorder category may respond to valproate and carbamazepine, particularly in light of the similarity between this type of anxiety and the symptoms of alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal. While benzodiazepines clearly have an important role in the treatment of anxiety and withdrawal states, the role of nonbenzodiazepine anticonvulsants is a promising one which needs to be further delineated with careful, controlled studies.", 
    "22": "This study determined the effects of flumazenil on the anesthetic requirements (MAC) of the dog for isoflurane (group 1; n = 6), enflurane (group 2; n = 7), and a combination of fentanyl-enflurane (group 3; n = 6). Control MAC in each group was determined by the tail-clamp method. Each animal in groups 1 and 2 received four iv incremental doses of flumazenil: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 4.5 mg/kg, and isoflurane MAC or enflurane MAC was determined after each dose. The animals in group 3 received a loading dose and a continuous infusion of fentanyl 0.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 over 8 h, and enflurane MAC was determined four times during this experimental period. After the fourth enflurane MAC determination in each animal of group 3, a single iv dose of flumazenil 1.5 mg/kg was injected and enflurane MAC was then determined for the last time. In the incremental doses administered, flumazenil did not demonstrate any agonistic or antagonistic interaction with isoflurane, enflurane, or the fentanyl-enflurane combination. In group 3, plasma fentanyl concentrations remained stable at 12.5 +/- 3.0 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) throughout the experiment and reduced enflurane MAC by 60 +/- 8%. The addition of flumazenil changed neither the fentanyl concentration in plasma (12.2 +/- 3.8 ng/ml) nor its reduction of enflurane MAC (61 +/- 7%). In conclusion, the absence of effect of flumazenil on the MAC of enflurane, isoflurane, or a fentanyl-enflurane combination suggests that they do not interact with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "23": "Three anesthetic techniques were compared in this study: 1) Intermittent Brevital boluses supplemented with fentanyl and midazolam all titrated to patient movement, 2) constant infusion of Brevital supplemented with fentanyl and midazolam all delivered in calculated mg/kg doses based on total body weight, and 3) constant infusion of methohexital (Brevital) and alfentanil (Alfenta) supplemented by midazolam (Versed), droperidol, and glycopyrolate (Robinul) delivered in calculated mg/kg doses based on lean body mass. Nitrous oxide was delivered in all cases via nasal mask in a 30% to 50% concentration. The mean total dose of Brevital in group 1 (intermittent Brevital bolus) was 0.17 mg/kg/min (SD = 0.07), group 2 (Brevital infusion) was 0.23 mg/kg/min (SD = 0.06), and group 3 (alfentanil/Brevital infusion) was 0.12 mg/kg/min (SD = 0.07). Mean total dose of alfentanil in group 3 equaled 1.58 mcg/kg/min (SD = 0.73). In group 1, 94% of the patients experienced moderate to severe movement intraoperatively. Twenty-three percent of the patients in group 2, and only 7% of group 3 exhibited moderate to severe movement. Emergence in group 3 averaged 4.5 minutes (SD = 1.6). Three patients (7%) in group 3 had postoperative nausea. Additional subjective findings in group 3 included easier airway maintenance during administration of the anesthetic, lack of unpleasant emergence phenomena such as crying, and prompt readiness for discharge. It was concluded that continuous alfentanil and Brevital infusion satisfied the objectives of safety, stability, predictability, and rapid recovery, while improving operating conditions (less patient movement) when compared with more traditional anesthetic techniques.", 
    "24": "The goal of this study was to examine the hypothesis that intravenous anesthetic induction agents alter neuroregulation of the cardiovascular system. Additional goals were to investigate this in an animal model devoid of other drug effects. Healthy mongrel dogs had arterial catheters inserted and pneumatic occluders positioned around the thoracic aorta and inferior vena cava. After 10 to 14 days of recovery, neurocirculatory control mechanisms were assessed in the absence of anesthesia by recording changes in the RR interval of the electrocardiogram in response to alterations in systolic arterial pressure. Systolic pressure was manipulated over a range of 65 to 200 mm Hg by random occlusion of either the inferior vena cava (hypotension) or aortic (hypertension) occluders. The animals were then given bolus doses of either thiopental (20 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg), ketamine (5 mg/kg), or etomidate (1.2 mg/kg) on separate days and in random order. The arterial pressure alterations were repeated 3, 10, and 20 minutes after the drugs were given. Regression curves were calculated expressing the slope relation between RR interval and systolic pressure at awake control and each time point after drug administration. The responses were compared with control by repeat measures analysis of variance. Thiopental significantly decreased this slope relation for 10 minutes. Diazepam decreased this slope at 3 minutes only. Ketamine, like thiopental, decreased this slope for 10 minutes. Following etomidate, the slopes were similar to control. We conclude that thiopental, diazepam, and ketamine impair neurocirculatory control capabilities. The effect of diazepam is only transient, whereas that of thiopental and ketamine is longer, and etomidate does not affect these reflexes.", 
    "25": "The anticonvulsant activity of diazepam and phenobarbital may be mediated in part by enhancement of inhibition involving gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). While both diazepam and phenobarbital increase GABA receptor chloride current, they may have different mechanisms of action, since they bind to different sites on the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex. We used the patch clamp technique to compare the effects of diazepam and phenobarbital on single GABA receptor currents. Outside-out patches were obtained from mouse spinal cord neurons grown in cell culture for 2 to 4 weeks. GABA (2 microM) evoked single channel currents that occurred as single brief openings or in bursts of multiple openings. Diazepam (20 nM) and phenobarbital (500 microM) both increased the GABA receptor current by increasing mean open time without altering channel opening frequency. However, the temporal grouping of openings into bursts suggested that the enhancement occurred via different mechanisms. Diazepam increased the frequency of bursting GABA receptor currents with minimal effect on the duration of bursts. Phenobarbital increased the duration of bursting GABA receptor currents without altering the frequency of bursts. These results suggest that diazepam binds to a site that may enhance single channel burst frequency by increasing the affinity of GABA binding, while phenobarbital may stabilize the bursting open state of the channel by binding to a different modulatory site at or near the chloride channel.", 
    "26": "Isolated small intestinal segments of the guinea pig were arterially perfused and the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) into the portal venous effluent measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Test substances were applied via the arterial perfusion medium. McN-A-343, pilocarpine and oxotremorine inhibited concentration-dependently the outflow of 5-HT and 5-HIAA. Pirenzepine (0.03-0.1 mumol/l) which can discriminate between M1 and M2-receptor subtypes antagonized completely this inhibitory effect. In the presence of 1 mumol/l tetrodotoxin (TTx), all three muscarine receptor agonists increased the outflow of 5-HT and 5-HIAA. Oxotremorine (1 mumol/l) was most effective and increased the outflow of 5-HT by 145%, that of 5-HIAA by 235%. McN-A-343 and pilocarpine, both at a concentration of 10 mumol/l, increased the outflow of 5-HT by about 40%, that of 5-HIAA by 50% and 71%, respectively. The stimulatory effect of oxotremorine was competitively antagonized by pirenzepine; a pA2 value of 7.70 was calculated. In conclusion, the cholinergic modulation of the release of 5-HT from the enterochromaffin cells consists of an indirect inhibitory (via the release of a neurotransmitter) and a direct stimulatory component. Muscarine receptors mediating the indirect effect may belong to the M1-subtype whereas the direct stimulatory effect may be mediated by a mixed population of M1 and M2 receptors or by a subtype of M1 receptors.", 
    "27": "The reduction in food intake induced by i.p. injections of the cholecystokinin (CCK) analogue caerulein was antagonised by a low dose (0.25 mumol/kg s.c.) of the selective CCK antagonist L-364,718. To block the anorectic effect of centrally administered caerulein a dose of 25 mumol/kg of L-364,718 was required, demonstrating that central CCK receptors can be blocked effectively in the rat by choosing appropriate doses of L-364,718.", 
    "28": "The novel antimuscarinic compound UH-AH 37 (6-chloro-5,10-dihydro-5-[(1-methyl-4-piperidyl)acetyl]-11H- dibenzo-[b, e][1,4]diazepine-11-one hydrochloride) showed a 14-fold higher affinity for ileal than for atrial muscarinic receptors. In receptor binding studies UH-AH 37 showed no marked selectivity for either atrial, glandular or ileal muscarinic binding sites. Moreover, it did not reveal binding heterogeneity in membranes from ileal smooth muscle. These result indicate that UH-AH 37 possesses a unique and novel selectivity profile.",

The literature data show that the benzodiazepines (BZ) should be administered for short periods of time, in order to avoid addiction and withdrawal symptoms. For this reason, the authors suggest that, before starting a therapy with such substances, an accurate clinical evaluation should be made and a good knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of the various BZ is essential.", 
    "30": "Carbachol induced a dose-dependent accumulation of inositol monophosphates in the Wistar rat pineal gland. The relative potency of muscarinic antagonists (atropine greater than pirenzepine much greater than gallamine) in blocking this response suggests the involvement of muscarinic M1 receptors. Following bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy, the carbachol-induced phosphoinositide response was similar to that seen in sham-operated controls, while adrenergic response was enhanced by 50%. The results indicate that the pineal has functional muscarinic receptors which are not affected by removal of the sympathetic innervation to the gland.", 
    "31": "The effects of peripheral benzodiazepines on the respiration of a neuronal cell, the mouse C 1300 neuroblastoma, were analyzed. The presence of 'peripheral receptors' to the [3H]PK 11195 ligand was checked in these cells. A dose-dependent decrease of the O2 consumption in the presence of Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 was observed at concentrations consistent with a receptor-mediated action. Diazepam, clonazepam and Ro 15-1788 were inactive. Previous studies have localized the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors on the mitochondrial outer membrane. We report here an effect of the peripheral ligand on mitochondrial metabolism.", 
    "32": "The effect of zolpidem, an imidazopyridine derivative with high affinity at the type I benzodiazepine recognition site, on the function of the GABAA/ionophore receptor complex was studied in vitro. Zolpidem, mimicking the action of diazepam, increased [3H]GABA binding, enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and reduced [35S]TBPS binding in rat cortical membrane preparations. Zolpidem was less effective than diazepam on the above parameters. Zolpidem induced a lower increase of [3H]GABA binding (23 vs. 35%) and muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake (22 vs. 40%) and a smaller decrease of [35S]TBPS binding (47 vs. 77%) than diazepam. The finding that zolpidem enhanced the function of GABAergic synapses with an efficacy qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of diazepam suggests that this compound is a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine recognition site. Thus, our results are consistent with the view that the biochemical and pharmacological profile of a benzodiazepine recognition site ligand reflects its efficacy to enhance GABAergic transmission. Whether the preferential affinity of zolpidem at the type I site is involved in its atypical biochemical and pharmacological profile remains to be clarified.", 
    "33": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptors purified from the brains of young and adult rats were photolabeled by [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]muscimol. Gel electrophoresis revealed 3 different proteins with apparent molecular weight (Mr) 51,000, 53,000 and 59,000 which were specifically and irreversibly labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam and recognized by the alpha-subunit specific antibody bd-28. Similarly, 3 different proteins with Mrs 51,000, 53,000 and 56,000 were irreversibly labeled by [3H]muscimol and recognized by the beta-subunit-specific antibody bd-17. Comparison of the photolabeling and immunological staining pattern from young and adult rats seems to indicate that proteins labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam and bd-28 are different from those labeled by [3H]muscimol and bd-17.", 
    "34": "Crude synaptic membranes of avian and mammalian brain tissue were photolabeled with the benzodiazepine-receptor ligand [3H]flunitrazepam and subsequently treated extensively with trypsin followed by incubation with endoglycosidase F. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography revealed that the final tryptic degradation product of 25 kDa in both pigeon and calf brain is deglycosylated in two steps. These results were confirmed by immunoblots of similarly pretreated membranes of pig brain using the alpha-subunit-specific monoclonal antibody bd-24. Benzodiazepine-receptor binding and its enhancement by GABA are largely retained after trypsinization. Based on the proposed transmembrane topology for the alpha-subunits of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor, we suggest that the large N-terminal domain of benzodiazepine-binding proteins is protected against tryptic cleavage.", 
    "35": "AHN 086, an isothiocyanato derivative of Ro 5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam), inhibits radioligand binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors with characteristics of an irreversible (acylating) ligand. We now report that [3H]AHN 086 labels a approximately 30 kDa protein in the rat pineal gland determined by both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography of digitonin-solubilized membranes. Specific incorporation of [3H]AHN 086 into this protein was inhibited by preincubating membranes with excess AHN 086. Moreover, significant specific binding of [3H]AHN 086 was not observed in either bovine pineal gland (which does not possess high-affinity binding sites for Ro 5-4864) or ovalbumin. These findings suggest that the approximately 30 kDa protein labeled by [3H]AHN 086 in rat pineal gland is associated with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in this tissue.", 
    "36": "A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the identification and/or quantification of diazepam, clobazam, flunitrazepam, triazolam, midazolam, oxazepam and lorazepam and some of their desmethylated and hydroxylated metabolites in plasma is described. Benzodiazepines were extracted from plasma with butyl acetate at pH 9; the hydroxylated compounds were then silylated with N,O-bis (trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide). Analysis was performed using a compact mass-selective detector operating in the electron-impact mode. Depending on the concentration, identification was performed either by direct comparison of the observed mass spectra with reference spectra or by the relative intensities of the most intense and characteristic ions in the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Quantification was performed in the SIM mode using the most intense ion. The intra-assay precision and accuracy were better than 5-6%; linearity was satisfactory up to 1-2 micrograms/ml. The detection limit was 1-5 ng/ml for most of the benzodiazepines. This method can be easily used in clinical situations when a safe and rapid response is essential for patient treatment.", 
    "37": "In patients with confirmed Alzheimer's disease--a condition for which no active treatment is available--the practitioner's first duty is to abstain from prescribing useless of harmful drugs that would make the situation worse. There is a long list of such potential nuisances. The most badly tolerated drugs unquestionably are anticholinergics, but one must also beware of tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics (sometimes unavoidable, however) and also, to a lesser extent, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers and so forth. Yet medical support is far from being ruled out. The benefits of placebos and drugs of undemonstrated value are not negligible, but above all it is mandatory to help the relative understand the truly pathological nature of almost unbearable behaviours. It is also very useful to advise the family on the life organization at home in order to perdure, on the legal safeguards, on whether or not the patient should be institutionalized, and similar topics. Inside institutions, keeping a sensible attitude between relentless therapy and euthanasia is the best way to ensure that the dignity of the demented patient will be preserved.", 
    "38": "Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is a common reversible organic psychiatric syndrome. This paper focuses on toxic delirium associated with prominent paroxysmal electroencephalogram (EEG) dysfunction occurring in nonepileptic patients. Our data derive from observations in two conditions, viz., delirium induced by hypnosedative drug withdrawal and confusion activated by psychotropic drug overdosage. It is suggested that in these conditions, delirium represents a generalized symptomatic nonconvulsive epileptic state following a transient transmitter dysfunction. Dramatic relief of both clinical and EEG dysfunction by intravenous benzodiazepines is reported in detail. Finally, the informative value of the EEG in the differential diagnosis of acute confusional states is emphasized.", 
    "39": "Single injections of the benzodiazepine, triazolam, induce phase shifts and cause a lengthening of the circadian activity rhythm in the golden hamster. The effect of triazolam on period depends on the phase of injection, but is not dependent on the direction of the phase shifts. Triazolam injections caused increases in period that were associated with phase advances as well as phase delays in the activity rhythm. This relationship between triazolam-induced phase shifts and changes in period is different from the relationship between light-induced phase shifts and period changes.", 
    "40": "Chemical ionization ion mobility spectrometry (CI-IMS) was used to characterize a number of benzodiazepines. In almost every example studied, the positive ion mobility spectrum consisted of a single ion peak corresponding to [M]+ or [MH]+. With some compounds, e.g., oxazepam, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide, fragment ions were noted that serve as good markers for the identification of these chemicals. Reduced mobility constants (K0) for the most significant peaks were calculated, and all ions produced were mass-analyzed by injection into a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The results of this study point to the potential of IMS as a qualitative tool for the rapid detection (analysis time less than 10 s) and reliable identification of benzodiazepines. Preliminary results on the application of digital signal processing and a second-derivative algorithm to partially overlapping IMS peaks are presented, and potential improvements are discussed.", 
    "41": "The effects of intrathecal (i.th.) injections of antispastic drugs were studied on spontaneous activity in the electromyogram (EMG) in genetically spastic rats and on spinal reflex transmission in anaesthetized normal rats. Baclofen, 0.2-2 nmol, and midazolam, 10-80 nmol, suppressed tonic activity in the EMG recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle in mutant rats, whereas tizanidine, 1-100 nmol, enhanced it. The action of baclofen was antagonized by i.th. co-administration of delta-aminovalerate but not by bicuculline, that of midazolam by systemic pretreatment with Ro 15-1788. The effect of i.th. tizanidine was antagonized by co-administration of prazosin but not by yohimbine. Baclofen, 2 nmol, exerted suppressant effects on Hoffman (H)-reflexes and spinal flexor reflexes in normal animals, midazolam, 80 nmol, only on flexor reflexes. Tizanidine, 100 nmol, failed to suppress H-reflexes and flexor reflexes. The present results demonstrate a myorelaxant effect of i.th. injections of baclofen and midazolam but not of i.th. tizanidine.", 
    "42": "Iontophoretic effects of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, flurazepam, and antagonist, flumazepil (RO-15-1788) on the retinal ganglion cells of kittens (7-9 weeks of age) have been compared with those of adult cats (18-22 weeks of age). In the adult retina, flurazepam decreased and flumazepil increased the visually evoked and spontaneous firing of ON-, but produced no effects on the response of OFF-retinal ganglion cells. However, in the kittens retina, in which ON-cells' selectivity to GABA is not fully developed, both the visually evoked and spontaneous activities of ON- and OFF-cells were inhibited by flurazepam and enhanced by flumazepil. This suggests that postnatal development of benzodiazepine action parallels that of GABA action at the retinal ganglion cells in the cat retina.", 
    "43": "The effects of intravenously and iontophoretically applied benzodiazepines, midazolam and flurazepam and their receptor antagonist, flumazepil (RO 15 1788), on visually evoked and spontaneous activities of the mammalian retinal ganglion cells have been studied. Intravenously applied midazolam and flurazepam suppressed both light-evoked and spontaneous firing of rat optic tract fibres. They reduced both the sensitivity to light and the temporal resolution of the fibres. Flumazepil (RO-15-1788), on the other hand, enhanced both light-evoked and spontaneous firing of the optic tract fibres. It increased their light sensitivity but did not affect their temporal resolution. In the cat, iontophoretically applied benzodiazepines suppressed and flumazepil increased the receptive field centre and surround response as well as the spontaneous firing of ON-type retinal ganglion cells which mainly receive GABAergic inputs. However, these drugs did not affect the activities of the OFF-type cells which mainly receive glycinergic inputs. These results suggest not only that the action of benzodiazepines on the retinal ganglion cells is mediated by benzodiazepine receptors that are linked with GABA receptors, but also that the retinal benzodiazepine receptors receive an endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand.", 
    "44": "The majority of specific benzodiazepine binding sites were found to be restricted to the innerplexiform layer of the rat retina, although there were minor amounts of binding in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. Relatively high levels of non-specific benzodiazepine binding sites were, on the other hand, found in the pigment epithelium and ciliary body, as well as in the corneal epithelium. The specific binding was enhanced by the GABA-A agonist, muscimol. In both rats and cats, neither acute nor chronic administration of benzodiazepines or their antagonists altered the retinal functions, as determined by the electroretinogram. These results suggest that retinal benzodiazepine receptors do not influence visually induced preganglionic retinal activity.", 
    "45": "The study was designed to assess the suitability of propofol for conscious sedation. Thirty-one patients undergoing bilateral third molar surgery were randomly given either propofol or midazolam for sedation as an adjunct to local anaesthesia at the first visit, and the alternative at the second visit. Propofol, like midazolam, produced reliable sedation, good operating conditions, stable vital signs and profound amnesia, with minimum intra-operative and post-operative adverse effects. Furthermore, most patients were willing to undergo either sedation procedure again. The advantages of propofol over midazolam were the ease with which the degree of sedation could be altered and the quick recovery. Its disadvantages were pain during injection, increased talkativeness, the extra equipment needed, and cost.", 
    "46": "We compared the effectiveness, safety, and costs of outpatient (n = 87) and inpatient (n = 77) detoxification from alcohol in a randomized, prospective trial involving 164 male veterans of low socioeconomic status. The outpatients were evaluated medically and psychiatrically and then were prescribed decreasing doses of oxazepam on the basis of daily clinic visits. The inpatient program combined comprehensive psychiatric and medical evaluation, detoxification with oxazepam, and the initiation of rehabilitation treatment. The mean duration of treatment was significantly shorter for outpatients (6.5 days) than for inpatients (9.2 days). On the other hand, significantly more inpatients (95 percent) than outpatient (72 percent) completed detoxification. There were no serious medical complications in either group. Outcome evaluations completed at one and six months for 93 and 85 percent of the patients, respectively, showed substantial improvement in both groups at both follow-up periods. At one month there were fewer alcohol-related problems among inpatients and fewer medical problems among outpatients. However, no group differences were found at the six-month follow-up, nor were differences found in the subsequent use of other alcoholism-treatment services. Costs were substantially greater for inpatients ($3,319 to $3,665 per patient) than for outpatients ($175 to $388). We conclude that outpatient medical detoxification is an effective, safe, and low-cost treatment for patients with mid-to-moderate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "47": "A retrospective review was made of all patients with the diagnosis of drug ingestion or overdose seen in an urban community hospital over 30 months. There were 133 episodes involving 129 patients. Of these, 104 (78%) were hospitalized, including 96 at the study hospital. Fifty-three patients (55%) were initially admitted to the intensive care unit, and 57 (59%) were cared for in the psychiatry unit at some time during their course. One patient died, and 21 others (15%) suffered adverse consequences, including airway compromise requiring intubation, aspiration, seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and significant arrhythmias. The treatment rendered was supportive only, with no patient requiring hemodialysis or hemoperfusion. Multiple drugs were involved in 31% of the overdoses. The most common agents were benzodiazepines (32%), tricyclic antidepressants (24%), and acetaminophen (20%). A history of drug ingestion was obtained in 94% of patients. Based on subsequent drug level and drug screen testing, the history was judged accurate in 71% and inaccurate in 29%. The problems confronting hospitals that care for relatively few overdose patients but in a consistent pattern are discussed.", 
    "48": "This study examined the effects of a minor tranquilizer, diazepam, on a cognitive task that involved the updating of beliefs. On this task, subjects are first asked to express their strength of belief in a hypothesis and then to update this on the basis of new evidence. Past research has shown that revision of beliefs can be affected by many variables including the strength with which the initial belief is held, whether new information is perceived as positive or negative vis-\u00e0-vis the hypothesis, and the order in which evidence is processed. The purpose of this study was to assess whether a tranquilizer, diazepam, would affect the updating of beliefs, and specifically whether it would dampen the extent to which people revise their opinions. 12 healthy subjects participated in four experimental sessions, in which they received diazepam (0.14 mg/kg) or placebo and completed an updating task in which they received information in either of two orders, positive-negative or negative-positive. In each session, subjects saw a different experimental stimulus determined by a Latin-square design, and also completed pre- and postdrug mood questionnaires. Analysis showed order of presentation induced a recency effect similar to that obtained in previous studies, and the diazepam produced significant tranquilizer-like effects on self-report questionnaires. However, the diazepam had no effect on the updating task. These findings indicate that previously reported order effects in the belief updating task are robust and unaffected by a drug that has known sedative and memory-impairing properties.",

    "50": "1. A range of muscarinic receptor antagonists were examined for affinity at the M1 muscarinic binding site, present in rat cerebrocortical membranes and the M2 muscarinic binding sites of rat cardiac and submaxillary gland membranes. 2. The results obtained were consistent with the presence of three classes of muscarinic binding site. 3. Both the M1 binding site, labelled by [3H]-pirenzepine ([3H]-Pir) in rat cerebrocortical membranes, and the M2 gland binding site, labelled by [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) in rat submaxillary gland membranes, displayed higher affinity for pirenzepine, dicyclomine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and cyclohexylphenyl (2-piperidinoethyl) silanol (CPPS) than did the M2 binding sites of cardiac membranes labelled by [3H]-NMS. 4. The M2 cardiac sites displayed higher affinity for methoctramine, himbacine and AF-DX 116 than did either the M1 binding site of cerebrocortical membranes or the M2 gland binding site present in rat submaxillary gland membranes. 5. The M1 and M2 gland binding sites could only be distinguished by considering the absolute affinity of compounds for these two sites. Thus, all compounds, with the exception of 4-DAMP, displayed between a 2 and 8 fold higher affinity for the M1 than for the M2 gland binding site. There were no antagonists with higher M2 gland than M1 affinity.", 
    "51": "1. Muscarinic receptors present in the human astrocytoma cell line 1321 N1 were characterized in radioligand binding studies and in functional studies of carbachol-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover. 2. In radioligand binding studies the muscarinic receptor in intact cells could be labelled using [3H]-N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) but not by [3H]-pirenzepine. In the intact cells these receptors displayed low pirenzepine affinity (pKi = 6.83) indicating that they were not of the M1 subtype. Furthermore, the 1321 N1 muscarinic receptors displayed low affinity for the two M2-cardiac selective ligands methoctramine (pKi = 5.82) and AF-DX 116 (pKi = 6.29). This pharmacology was consistent with the 1321 N1 cells containing a single population of muscarinic receptors that displayed a similar pharmacology to the M2-receptor present in exocrine gland tissue. 3. The M2-gland nature of the receptors was further indicated in the functional studies where antagonist affinities were determined from their ability to antagonize carbachol-stimulated PI turnover in 1321 N1 cells. pA2 values for pirenzepine (7.31), methoctramine (6.10) and AF-DX 116 (6.52) were similar to those determined in the binding studies. 4. From these studies we conclude that 1321 N1 astrocytoma cells contain an M2-gland muscarinic receptor which mediates muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of PI turnover in these cells.", 
    "52": "Moderate to severe arterial oxygen desaturation (SaO2 75-88%) occurred in three of four patients who were given sedation during regional conduction block without the administration of oxygen. No desaturation occurred in six patients given oxygen 2 litre min-1 via a nasal catheter during similar procedures. It is concluded that patients undergoing regional conduction block with concurrent sedation should receive additional oxygen routinely unless a pulse oximeter is available for monitoring.", 
    "53": "Rats were submitted to a training and a test session in a shuttle avoidance task. In some groups, a second training session was interpolated 2 or 24 hr after the first session. In others, a session of extinction was interpolated 2 or 24 hr after the training session. When the interpolated task was 2 hr after training, training-test interval was 24 hr. When the interpolated task was 24 hr after training, training-test interval was 48 hr. The additional training enhanced, and the extinction depressed, retention test performance. Diazepam, given 30 min prior to the first (or only) training session enhanced the performance of avoidance responses in that session but inhibited it in the subsequent retention test. Diazepam given 90 min after training had no effect on retention. Diazepam given 30 min prior to either the additional training session or the extinction session did not affect performance in that session but cancelled their effects on retention test performance. The effects are related to the previously described prevention by diazepam of interfering effects on memory.", 
    "54": "The clinical effects and pharmacokinetics of 24 h infusion of midazolam (MDZ) during major maxillofacial surgery and postoperative observation in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were studied in 20 patients. During anaesthesia, infusion of MDZ at 5 mg/h combined with 67% nitrous oxide, 1.8 (s.d. = 0.8) mg of fentanyl, and 26.5 (s.d. = 11.4) mg of vecuronium, adequately suppressed clinical responses to surgical nociceptive stimuli. Postoperatively, infusion of MDZ was continued in the ICU at 5 mg/h until 9 a.m. of the first postoperative day for sedation of the intubated but spontaneously breathing patients. The depth of sedation in the ICU was scored from 1-5 (1 = \"awake and tense\", 5 = \"unable to communicate\"). During infusion the sedation score decreased from 3.8 after ICU arrival to 2.2 at 8 a.m. of the first postoperative day. Neither ventilatory nor circulatory depression were observed. After cessation of MDZ, recovery from sedation was fast. The degree of amnesia was low. During constant rate infusion no increase in plasma concentration of either MDZ or metabolites occurred. T1/2 beta of MDZ after cessation was 125 min (range 90-320) and its total body clearance was 10.5 ml/kg/min (s.d. = 3.1). The volume of distribution, clearance and T1/2 beta were significantly longer in women than in men. It was concluded that 24 h of MDZ infusion at 5 mg/h caused satisfactory ICU sedation with fast recovery, but that individual tailoring of the infusion rate may still improve the quality of sedation.", 
    "55": "Midazolam can be used to achieve anxiolysis, to provide conscious sedation with anterograde amnesia during operations performed under local or regional anesthesia, to induce general anesthesia, and as part of a balanced anesthetic.

When used with vigilance, appropriate patient monitoring, and slow, careful titration to desired effect, midazolam is an extremely useful and safe medication for both inpatients and outpatients.", 
    "56": "Hypoxemia during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or panendoscopy has been generally attributed to sedation. We studied 49 patients ranging in age from 17 to 71 years with normal or nearly normal lung function undergoing EGD to determine the effects of sedation and the effects of the endoscope on arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). All patients received intravenous diazepam and 41 also received meperidine. EGD was delayed 10.7 +/- 7.5 min after intravenous diazepam administration in the 42 group 1 patients. Seven patients underwent EGD within 2 min of receiving intravenous diazepam (group 2). Ventilation decreased after diazepam, recovered, then decreased immediately after endoscope insertion in the group 1 patients. Periods of hypopnea, up to 39 s long, were observed during EGD. The average decrease in SaO2 was 4.0% after diazepam (p less than 0.0001). SaO2 returned to the pre-EGD level, then decreased 2.4% during EGD (p less than 0.0005). Maximum SaO2 decrease occurred 27 +/- 6 s after insertion of the endoscope then rapidly recovered. There was a linear correlation between the duration of hypopnea and maximum SaO2 decrease (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). All group 2 patients experienced a period of hypopnea (13.3 +/- 9.6 s) and SaO2 declined 9.0%. The SaO2 decline was significantly greater in the group 2 subjects (p less than 0.0001). Our results confirm previous findings that intravenous sedation causes hypoventilation and hypoxemia. Moreover, hypoventilation and further arterial oxygen desaturation are caused by either the mechanical effect of the endoscope or a reflex stimulated by it.", 
    "57": "In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, the encephalotropic and psychotropic properties of a new partial benzodiazepine agonist Ro 16-6028 were investigated as compared to a pure agonist diazepam utilizing quantitative EEG and psychometric analysis as well as clinical observations. Ten normal volunteers received randomized (latin square design) and at weekly intervals, single oral doses of placebo, 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028 and 10 mg diazepam as reference substance. EEG-recordings, psychometric tests and evaluation of blood pressure, pulse and side effects were carried out at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h. Computer-assisted spectral analysis of the EEG demonstrated after 10 mg diazepam, a typical \"anxiolytic\" pharmaco-EEG profile characterized by an increase of beta activity, decrease of alpha activity and acceleration of the centroid total activity. Ro 16-6028 induced in the vigilance-controlled recordings a similar profile thereby exhibiting tranquilizing properties too. However, in the resting condition we observed also an increase of delta/theta activity along with a decrease of alpha activity while the beta augmentation was observed mostly in the fast frequency bands and not so much in the middle fast frequency bands as is the case with the known full agonists. The latter findings were somewhat reminiscent of the pharmaco-EEG profiles seen often in certain neuroleptics. Our data indicate a selective sedation after the novel partial agonist. Dose/treatment-efficacy calculations demonstrated 10 mg diazepam as the most CNS-effective drug followed closely by 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028, 0.1 mg and 0.05 mg, while placebo induced the least changes. Only 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028 and the reference compound differed from placebo at all times. Time-efficacy calculations showed a peak effect of the novel partial agonist around the 3rd h and that of diazepam in the 1st h. Psychometric tests demonstrated similar findings. After 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028 a decrease of attention, numerical memory, psychomotor activity, wakefulness and CFF was observed, while mood improved at later time periods outlasting the sedation. After 10 mg diazepam 10 out of 13 psychometric and psychophysiological variables showed significant findings previously described as typical for anxiolytic sedatives in normals. On the whole, the partial agonist induced less sedation than the full agonist, which is reflected in its superiority in regard to noopsychic and thymopsychic functions. Evaluation of pulse and blood pressure showed no clinically relevant findings. The new partial agonist was well tolerated.", 
    "58": "The anxiolytic agents, buspirone and diazepam, increase the paw lick latency of rats in the hot plate test, the effect being dose-dependent and exceeding that of morphine. The action of buspirone was not accompanied by ataxic and sedative effects which were observed in rats on diazepam. Buspirone (up to 25 mg/kg) and diazepam (up to 5 mg/kg) neither change the tail flick latency nor potentiate the action of morphine on the test. A buspirone dose of 2 mg/kg administered to animals before foot shock, or the dose of 1.5 mg/kg before cold swimming stress, led to a significant increase in hot plate latency 1 min after stress as compared to the control. The effect of buspirone on the paw lick reaction in rats may be related to the activation of antinociceptive mechanisms and inhibition of an emotional-motivational component of the pain reaction.", 
    "59": "1. A method was developed to quantify paired-pulse depression of population spikes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized rats with paired stimuli to the contralateral CA3 region at various states of excitability of pyramidal cells. This method was applied to measure changes following recurrent seizures, a single seizure, or long-term potentiation (LTP). 2. In naive animals paired-pulse depression was highly variable at low stimulus intensities, but constant above a certain \"threshold\" stimulus intensity. The potency of paired-pulse depression also depended on the time between paired stimuli, being maximal at an interpulse interval of 20 ms. The general relationships of paired-pulse depression to stimulus intensity and to interpulse interval were unaltered after LTP, after a single seizure, and after recurrent seizures, but there were quantitative changes in the last two cases. 3. A variety of pharmacologic agents known to interact with GABAergic inhibition were studied for their effect on paired-pulse depression. These agents affected earlier phases of paired-pulse depression (interpulse intervals less than or equal to 100 ms). The GABA agonist muscimol and the benzodiazepine diazepam enhanced paired-pulse depression whereas the GABA antagonist bicuculline decreased it. 4. Repeated seizures elicited by trains (50-Hz, 10-s durations every 5 min) of electrical stimuli to the hippocampus were associated with progressive lengthening of afterdischarges. 5. Recurrent seizures caused a statistically significant reduction in the potency of earlier phases of paired-pulse depression. There was an increase in the potency of later phases of paired-pulse depression after recurrent seizures, but this was not statistically significant. These changes were present for at least 2 h after the last seizure. 6. An antidromic-orthdromic paired-pulse protocol was used to exclude slow conductance changes as the cause of paired-pulse depression. Paired-pulse depression measured with this method was also decreased by recurrent seizures. 7. A single seizure caused a small reduction in paired-pulse depression that dissipated in less than an hour. 8. A single seizure caused LTP of stimulus intensity versus population spike curves whereas recurrent seizures attenuated or even reversed the potentiation, leading to a rightward shift of the curves relative to control curves. When LTP was produced by a less intense stimulus train (50-Hz, 400-ms duration), there were no associated seizures nor was there any change in paired-pulse depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "60": "We and others previously reported that nocturnal GH secretion in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is blunted by acute cholinergic muscarinic blockade with pirenzepine. In this study, we investigated whether this inhibitory effect on GH secretion persists during chronic pirenzepine administration, and if pirenzepine administration affects glycemic control. Nocturnal GH secretion was studied from 2300-0800 h before and after one month of pirenzepine administration (100 mg/day, orally, given at 2300 h) in 13 diabetic patients receiving their usual insulin treatment. GH secretion (GH area under curve) was blunted after pirenzepine administration [mean, 877 +/- 215 (+/- SE) vs. 1407 +/- 311 micrograms/L.min; P less than 0.002]. During pirenzepine administration, hemoglobin A1c significantly decreased (P less than 0.02), and 4 of the 13 patients had lower daily insulin requirements (5-23 U/day), but there was no significant change for the group as a whole. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of pirenzepine on GH secretion persists when pirenzepine is given chronically and that pirenzepine seems to improve the metabolic control of the patients.", 
    "61": "To determine the effect of benzodiazepine premedication on central nervous system and cardiovascular effects of bupivacaine, the authors administered toxic doses of bupivacaine to awake spontaneously breathing pigs after intravenous premedication with midazolam (0.06 mg/kg), diazepam (0.15 mg/kg), or saline. Five minutes after administration of one of these solutions, they began an infusion of bupivacaine at 2 mg.kg-1.min-1. The bupivacaine infusion was continued until cardiovascular collapse. They then attempted to resuscitate the animals via open chest cardiac massage and a standard resuscitation protocol. Premedication with midazolam or diazepam significantly delayed the onset of ventricular dysrhythmias (P less than 0.05), decreased the incidence of seizures (P less than 0.05), and prevented the increase in blood pressure and heart rate following bupivacaine infusion (P less than 0.05). Benzodiazepine premedication did not affect the dose of bupivacaine or the blood concentration required to produce cardiovascular collapse. The ability to resuscitate animals premedicated with midazolam did not differ from control; however, significantly fewer animals premedicated with diazepam were resuscitated (P less than 0.05). A clinically relevant observation was that almost all animals premedicated with a benzodiazepine progressed directly to cardiovascular collapse without first manifesting seizures.", 
    "62": "We treated successfully 16 patients with stones in the mid ureter, that is overlying the pelvic bone, in the prone position with a Dornier HM3 lithotriptor. The lithotriptor was equipped with the original reflector and generator system, and all treatments were performed with only surface anesthesia of the skin and premedication with pethidine chloride and diazepam. Between 1 and 3 sessions were necessary with up to 2,000 shock waves at each session. The generator voltage was varied between 14 and 18 kv. After completion of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy all patients became free of stones without ureteroscopy or transureteral manipulation except for a ureteral catheter and fluid irrigation during treatment.", 
    "63": "The purpose of this study was to determine the duration of amnesia associated with the intravenous usage of midazolam and fentanyl. The midazolam was administered in three different dosages based on the patient's weight in kilograms. Patients were shown a series of pen-and-ink drawings at various times throughout the procedure and tested the next day for memory of the drawings using both free recall and match-to-sample paradigms. The results indicate that the low-dosage group (0.07 mg/kg) had insufficient amnesia, whereas the medium (0.10 mg/kg) and high (0.13 mg/kg) groups displayed adequate amnesia in the intraoperative period.", 
    "64": "The frequency, severity, and duration of oxygen desaturation during oral surgical procedures in outpatients was measured. Sixty patients divided into six groups received either lidocaine; lidocaine, diazepam, and meperidine; lidocaine, diazepam, meperidine, and headphone music; lidocaine, diazepam, meperidine, and nitrous oxide; lidocaine, diazepam, meperidine, methohexital, and nitrous oxide; or lidocaine and nitrous oxide. Forty-three percent of the 30 patients who did not receive supplemental oxygen experienced clinically significant oxygen desaturation (greater than 5%) with a mean duration of 4.6 minutes. Only 13% of the patients who received supplemental oxygen had significant desaturation ranging from ten seconds to 12.3 minutes with a mean duration of 1.4 minutes. An unexpected finding was hypoxia in patients receiving only lidocaine anesthesia.", 
    "65": "Sixty-four patients treated with cisplatin-containing regimens were entered into a randomized, double-blinded study examining the antiemetic efficacy of metoclopramide with and without lorazepam for control of cisplatin-induced emesis. Metoclopramide was administered to all patients at 2 mg/kg, intravenously, 30 minutes before chemotherapy and 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 hours posttreatment. Patients randomized to receive combined antiemetic therapy were administered lorazepam at 2 mg/m2 (maximum, 4 mg dose) intravenously, 30 minutes before chemotherapy. Those patients not receiving lorazepam were given normal saline placebo. Degree of nausea and number of vomiting episodes were recorded on a data flow sheet with a visual analogue scale. Drug toxicities were evaluated before each administered dose. Patients receiving both metoclopramide and lorazepam experienced significantly less vomiting episodes (P less than 0.05) and nausea (P less than 0.01) when compared to patients given metoclopramide alone. Forty-four percent of those receiving the combined therapy reported no nausea or vomiting episodes compared to only 22% receiving metoclopramide alone. Sedation was significantly more common in patients receiving lorazepam (88%) as opposed to patients receiving only metoclopramide (43%), P less than 0.01. Amnesia was seen in 25% receiving lorazepam. No significant difference in diarrhea, dystonia, or disinhibition was observed between the two arms. The authors conclude that the combination of lorazepam and metoclopramide was superior to metoclopramide alone in the prevention of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting, with sedation and amnesia more commonly observed in the combined regimen.", 
    "66": "It has been reported that N-methylcarbamylcholine (MCC), a nicotinic agonist, binds to central nicotinic receptors and causes an increase of acetylcholine (ACh) release from certain central cholinergic nerve terminals. The present experiments determine whether these two phenomena change in response to the chronic administration of nicotine, a procedure known to result in an increase in nicotinic binding sites. Chronic nicotine caused a brain region-specific up-regulation of [3H]MCC sites; binding increased in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, but not in the occipital cortex or cerebellum. The effect of nicotine was selective to nicotinic binding sites, because muscarinic sites, both M1 ([ 3H]pirenzepine) and M2 ([3H]ACh), were unaffected by chronic nicotine treatment. MCC increased the release of ACh from the frontal cortex and hippocampus by a calcium-dependent mechanism; MCC did not alter ACh release from striatum or occipital cortex of control animals. The MCC-induced increase in ACh release was not apparent in those animals which had been treated with nicotine. There was a partial recovery of nicotinic autoreceptor function when animals were allowed to recover (4 days) following chronic nicotine treatment, but the density of binding sites remained increased compared to control. Chronic nicotine did not change the potassium-evoked release of ACh from the frontal cortex or hippocampus, but decreased this measure from striatum. It also decreased the ACh content of the striatum, but not that of the cortex or the hippocampus; the activity of choline acetyltransferase was not altered in any of the regions tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the presence of possible interactions between Levodropropizine and benzodiazepines (BZ). Experience was performed recording bioccipital quantified EEG in 5 healthy volunteers in normal conditions, after BZ administration and after BZ plus Levodropropizine administration. The slight shifting towards lower frequences in quantified EEG, due to BZ, was not modified by Levodropropizine administration. As results from this experience Levodropropizine seems not to have sinergic action on BZ effect in quantified EEG.",

    "69": "Ketamine hydrochloride seems to be equally suitable for surface and major plastic surgical operations where controlled ventilation is required. Controlled ventilation performed by less amount of muscle relaxant where patients were ventilated with air only sparing the O2 and N2O. Fifty patients undergoing various operations including major plastic surgery were divided into two groups. In group A, an infusion of 500 mg ketamine hydrochloride, 20 mg diazepam in 500 ml of 5% dextrose was used as anaesthetic and in group B, the same drip was started and pancuronium bromide 0.08 mg/kg IV was given when eyelash reflexes were lost. Mean durations of anaesthesia were 70.4 minutes and 90.2 minutes in groups A and B respectively. Mean doses of ketamine hydrochloride required were 310 mg and 370 mg in groups A and B respectively. Decurarisation was done in usual way in group B patients. The induction, maintenance and recovery were smooth and uneventful in all cases. Moreover no difficulty was encountered in reversing residual curarisation in any of the patients in group B. Mean rise of systolic BP was 12.5 mm Hg and that of pulse rate was 20/minute in group A. In group B, mean rise of systolic BP was 10 mm Hg and that of pulse rate was 16/minute.",

    "71": "In pursuing the study on pyridodiazepinone derivatives, in order to verify the variation of biological activity induced by replacement of the heteroaromatic with an aromatic nucleus and by the introduction of chlorine on the benzene ring, a series of 1-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-4-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin- 2-ones and of 7-chloro-analogues were prepared. Some benzodiazepinones and their 7-chloro-analagous were subjected to pharmacological experimentation in order to evaluate and compare their effect upon mice with regard to exploratory activity, motor coordination and spontaneous motility. In addition their anti-strychnine, anti-cardiazole, anti-amphetamine and anti-reserpine activities were also evaluated.", 
    "72": "Experiments were carried out on 36 urethane-chloralose aneasthesized, paralyzed, vagotomized and artificially ventilated rabbits. Five-barrel glass micropipettes were used to record unit discharges and to apply flurazepam iontophoretically in the region of the nucleus parabrachialis. Inspiratory units (IUs), expiratory units (EUs), phase-spanning units (I-EUs and E-IUs) and non-respiratory units (NRUs) were observed. 26 (55.3%) out of 47 IUs, 17 (94.4%) out of 18 EUs, 11 (91.7%) out of 12 I-EUs, 2 (18.1%) out of 11 E-IUs and 43 (60.6%) out of 71 NRUs were depressed by flurazepam. The depressant ratio of EUs and I-EUs was statistically different from that of IUs and E-IUs respectively. In flurazepam sensitive 5 IUs and 2 EUs, the depressant effect could not be antagonized by GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline. In 10 flurazepam sensitive NRUs, there were 6 (60%) units whose depressant effect of flurazepam could be antagonized by bicuculline. In addition, the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on the respiratory units and NRUs were examined, 15 (75%) out of 20 IUs were excited and the remaining units were not influenced. The effects of ACh on the EUs, I-EUs and E-IUs were variable, but the effects of ACh on the NRUs were mainly excitatory. In 5 IUs and 1 phase-spanning respiratory units, the depressant effect of flurazepam could not be antagonized by ACh. The results showed that flurazepam mainly depressed the EUs and I-EUs in the region of nucleus parabrachialis, thus interfering with the normal phase transition between the inspiratory and expiratory phase and reducing the respiratory rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "The interactions of acidic and basic drugs with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) were investigated using circular dichroism (CD) measurements. Extrinsic Cotton effects were generated by the binding of drugs to alpha 1-AGP. The CD data suggested the presence of a single binding site on the alpha 1-AGP molecule. The induced ellipticities of the acidic drug-alpha 1-AGP system decreased with increasing pH, while the ellipticities for the basic drugs increased with pH. The ellipticities for all drugs were reduced by the addition of fatty acids. Furthermore, the induced ellipticities decreased in the presence of cesium chloride for basic drugs bound to alpha 1-AGP. The extrinsic Cotton effects therefore appear to result from hydrophobic interaction with alpha 1-AGP for the acidic drugs and from hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions for the basic drugs.", 
    "74": "Based upon differences in open field and conflict behaviors, the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains have been proposed as a genetically-based \"animal model\" for the study of emotionality and/or anxiety. The present study compared the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains in the Defensive Burying paradigm. Prior to testing, female MR/Har and MNRA/Har rats were placed in a 40 X 30 X 40 cm Plexiglas chamber containing clay bedding material (5 cm deep) for 30 minute periods on each of four consecutive days. On the fifth day, a wire wrapped prod was placed at one end of the chamber. Rats were placed in the chamber singly and a 3 mA shock was delivered upon contact with the prod. Defensive Burying behavior (i.e., the moving of bedding material toward or over the prod) was recorded for each animal for 15 minutes postshock. There was no MR/Har versus MNRA/Har difference in the percent of animals exhibiting Defensive Burying, nor was there a MR/Har versus MNRA/Har difference in the latency to initiation or the duration of this behavior. Thus, these genetically-defined Maudsley rat strains do not appear to differ in all \"animal models\" for the study of anxiety or fear.", 
    "75": "Regional concentrations of serotonin (5HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography in 16 discrete brain areas of non-stressed control Wistar rats and of stressed Wistar rats. Stress was induced by immobilization for one hour. Also studied were the effects of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) on concentrations of 5HT and 5HIAA in 10 discrete brain areas of the non-stressed as well as stressed rats. In control rats, regional concentrations of 5HT and 5HIAA varied in the different areas of the prefrontal cortices, limbic structures, striatum and hypothalamus with the highest 5HT contents in the area hypothalamicus lateralis and the lowest in the anterior cingulate cortex. Acute immobilization induced increases in 5HIAA content in prefrontal cortex polar field (FCP), prefrontal cortex medial field (FCM), n. preopticus medialis (PM), area hypothalamicus lateralis (L) and n. dorsomedialis (DM) and also increases in 5HT content in the PM, L, DM, and n. arcuatus median eminence (ARC-ME). In the non-stressed rats, morphine caused an elevation of 5HIAA concentration in the striatum and PM, and also an elevation of 5HT content in the PM and DM, while diazepam induced no alteration in the concentrations of 5HIAA and 5HT. In the stressed rats, morphine potentiated the stress-induced elevation of 5HIAA content in the striatum and attenuated the stress-induced elevation of 5HIAA in the PM and L, and that of 5HT in the PM, remaining 5HIAA content in FCP and FCM unaltered. Diazepam canceled the stress-induced increase in 5HIAA levels in FCP, FCM, CP and DM and in 5HT levels in DM. These results suggest that diazepam may reduce fear and anxiety by attenuating stress-induced increase of serotonin turnover.", 
    "76": "A trial transdermal dosage form designed to sustain a suitable plasma concentration of clonazepam (CZP) was produced using a porous membrane (Hipore 2100 or 4050) and applied to rabbits and rats for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations. The release rate constants for the drug through the porous membranes were significantly smaller than that without any membrane. The transdermal system (Hipore 4050 system, ointment 0.25 g, 2.25 cm2) provided a well sustained plasma concentration of CZP and the therapeutic plasma concentration range was maintained for about 26 h. When the Hipore 4050 system with an increased amount of ointment and enlarged absorption area (0.5 g, 4.0 cm2) was applied, the therapeutic range was sustained for about 40 h, and slightly higher plasma levels over the whole application period and much higher bioavailability (37%) were obtained compared with those after the 2.25 cm2-Hipore 4050 system. The transdermal system exerted an excellent anticonvulsant activity in rats, with the best (3+ or 4+) protective score. The plasma concentrations of CZP when the activity was estimated were in the therapeutic range. Thus, the transdermal system has the potential to be an efficient drug delivery system.", 
    "77": "The percutaneous (p.c.) absorption of clonazepam (CZP), an antiepileptic drug, was investigated in rabbits. CZP was efficiently absorbed from a gel ointment (0.5% CZP, 1g, 9 cm2) with Azone and therapeutic plasma concentrations were maintained for 27 h. The bioavailability of CZP from the gel ointment was 47.2 +/- 3.1%, which was significantly larger than that (3.3 +/- 0.5%) after the ointment without Azone or that (12.5 +/- 3.6%) after oral administration. About a half of CZP in the ointment with Azone was absorbed during a 24 h application. The maximum and minimum plasma concentrations and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve gradually increased during repeated application of the ointment (2% CZP, 0.25 g/d, 2.25 cm2), probably due to the accumulation of drug in the skin and body. The efficient absorption and sustained plasma concentration of CZP after application suggest that a once a day p.c. administration regimen is possible by using the ointment with Azone.", 
    "78": "A case of successful suicide from overdose of amitriptyline, perphenazine, and midazolam is described. Postmortem findings were inadequate to explain the death. Sudden cardiac arrest suggested that the death from overdose probably resulted from drug cardiotoxicity. The physicians should be aware of this serious complication when prescribing a combination of these potential lethal drugs. A limited supply should be given to depressed patients.", 
    "79": "Midazolam hydrochloride is an ultra-short acting benzodiazepine recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for anesthesia induction and preoperative sedation. Frequently, midazolam is also used as an injection or infusion for the treatment of agitation in ventilator-dependent patients. A 53-year-old man underwent a gastrojejunostomy and was later intubated following the development of pseudomonal pneumonia. Midazolam was initiated in an effort to resolve his agitation and the patient continued to receive frequent bolus injections, averaging 22 mg/d over 21 days. Approximately eight hours after midazolam was abruptly discontinued, the patient became increasingly anxious and developed somatic complaints felt to be consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms rapidly abated upon the reintroduction of midazolam and the drug was ultimately tapered over a period of four days and discontinued without further incident. Implications derived from the association of long-term midazolam therapy with benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome are discussed.", 
    "80": "In an administrative district of roughly 70,000 inhabitants, two-thirds urban, one-third rural, 60 patients, 46 male, 14 female, received out-patient treatment for alcoholic predelirious syndromes during the period 1982-1986. The total number of predeliorious attacks was 91, age incidence lay between 18 and 65, peaking at 35 to 45. In 61.7% of the cases only one predelirious attack occurred, in 28.3% two, and in 10.0% three or more. Through the period there is a perceptible rising tendency. In eight cases there was an epileptic grand mal fit in the course of a predelirious attack. Out-patient treatment was successful in all but three cases, which definitely called for hospitalised treatment. Diazepam, Diazepam/Haloperiodol, and Distraneurin were administered orally as a regular part of the program of treatment. 30 times Diazepam and Haloperidol effected a cure, while in 61 attacks it appeared that treatment with Chlormethiazol was inevitable. Results are discussed and conclusions drawn.", 
    "81": "Graded doses of nicotine (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) were administered alone and together with three doses of diazepam (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) to rats responding on a fixed-interval 2-min schedule of liquid food reinforcement. Nicotine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) increased overall rate, but diazepam had little effect. Both nicotine and the two highest doses of diazepam attenuated the change in response rate through the interval. When combined with nicotine the lowest dose of diazepam increased overall rates above those produced by nicotine alone. However, it appeared to diminish the effects of nicotine on the within-interval pattern of responding. These changes appeared to be due to an elevation in the high rates at the end of the interval. In contrast, the highest diazepam dose increased overall response rates when combined with low doses of nicotine, but decreased the high rates observed after larger nicotine doses. This dose of diazepam combined in an additive manner with nicotine to reduce the degree of response rate change within the interval. The interaction between nicotine and diazepam depends on the aspect of behavior under investigation and the particular doses of the two drugs.", 
    "82": "A parallel rise in hip fracture incidence and the rate of prescription of drugs affecting postural stability have been investigated by a case-control study. Other risk factors were also considered. One hundred and seventy-three cases and 134 hospital emergency surgical controls were interviewed and briefly examined, and drug data were corroborated by letter to general practitioners. The analysis revealed no significant difference between consumption of benzodiazepines in cases and controls, major tranquillizers, diuretics or other anti-hypertensives. However, they differed significantly in their average body weight and incidence of stroke. It is suggested that hip fractures on the whole occur in a particularly frail group of elderly people and that the increased fracture incidence over the last 20 years results from the survival of a more frail or less active group than hitherto.", 
    "83": "The effects of intravenously administered mephenesin, tolperisone, baclofen, diazepam and midazolam on reflex activity were studied in unanesthetized spinal cats. Monosynaptic, as well as polysynaptic ventral root reflexes, the dorsal root potential and the dorsal root reflex were recorded simultaneously from L6-S1 segments. An analogue integrating method was developed for quantitative monitoring and recording ipsilateral spinal root potentials evoked by stimulation of the tibial nerve. Mephenesin (12.5-50 mg/kg) caused a significant and dose-dependent reduction in the polysynaptic and the dorsal root reflexes, slightly decreased the dorsal root potential but minimally affected the monosynaptic ventral root reflex. Tolperisone (2.5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited both ventral root reflexes and the dorsal root reflex. It slightly prolonged the dorsal root potential without affecting the amplitude. Baclofen (0.5 mg/kg) abolished the monosynaptic reflex, partially inhibited the polysynaptic reflex, while dorsal root responses were less attenuated. Both benzodiazepines exerted similar actions, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively: the polysynaptic reflex was partially reduced while the monosynaptic reflex was not modified by diazepam or midazolam. Dorsal root responses were enhanced and the half-time of decay of the dorsal root potential was prolonged. Different patterns of action of muscle relaxants studied here are discussed in terms of their possible mechanisms of action. Profound depressant effects of mephenesin and tolperisone on the dorsal root reflex are in contrast to the small effect of both drugs on the dorsal root potential and might reflect their inhibition of spike-generating mechanisms. For a yet unknown reason, various spinal pathways are affected differentially by baclofen. In spinal cats, the reduction by benzodiazepines of the polysynaptic reflex may be related to the potentiation of some unidentified GABA-ergic inhibitory processes. The use of water-soluble midazolam, as a model compound instead of diazepam, is suggested because the usual organic solvents for diazepam may affect its action.", 
    "84": "The pharmacology of two muscarinic responses, recorded from the ventral roots of the spinal cord in the neonatal rat, have been compared: the depolarising response and the inhibition of the monosynaptic compound action potential (CAP). Pirenzepine was more potent than AF-DX 116 in antagonising the depolarising response. However, the potencies of these compounds indicated that this response may be mediated by neither M1 nor M2 (cardiac-like) receptors. The drug AF-DX 116 (1 microM), but not pirenzepine, selectively reduced the inhibitory effect. It is concluded that the receptors mediating these two responses are different.", 
    "85": "300 women aged 16-37 received analgesic-sedative preparations for miniabortions preprandially after admittance to the clinic. Anamnesis was followed by routine blood pressure check, then 0.01 mg/kg-1 atropine, 0.1 mg/kg-1 diazepam iv, or 0.05 mg/kg-1 midazolam iv was given to 25 women. 1-2 minutes later 0.5 mg/kg-1 ketamine iv was given, and at the time of insertion of the aspiration cannula into the cervix, another dose of 0.25 mg/kg-1 of ketamine was given iv. The total dose did not exceed 1 mg/kg-1 iv. All patients also received a ketamine-benzodiazepine combination of analgesia prior to the miniabortion procedure. In psychic, unstable women anxiolytic effects were apparent, but in all of them vertigo and the sensation of floating ensued with horizontal and vertical nystagmus, although information could be extracted from them depending on the degree of analgesia. Anterograde amnesia followed, and the systolic and diastolic pressure increased. The maximum duration of analgesic effect was 3-5 minutes, most women became well-oriented without ataxia and returned home 4 hours after the operation. No psychic effects lasted, and nausea or vomiting was minimal. The hallucinogenic effect of ketamine was attributable to the stimulation of the central dopaminergic system, while diazepam (Spofa) influenced the limbic system causing anterograde amnesia. The potential of midazolam-benzodiazepine combination for future sue lies in its very short biological half-life (1.5-2.5 hours) compared with diazepam (24-36 hours).", 
    "86": "The authors investigated the therapeutic results in gastroduodenal ulcers in 96 patients treated with Gastrozepin (Slovakofarma), using daily doses of 75 mg combined with antacids. The examinations were made by means of a videogastroscope of Welch-Allyn Co. with subsequent control after four weeks, and if the ulcer was not healed, after two-week intervals. During the first examination they recorded the size of the ulcer and during check-up examinations the stage of healing. In a group of 51 men with a mean age of 44.4 years the incidence of duodenal ulcers was 29 cases (59.6%) and gastric ulcers 22 cases (43.1%). In a group of 45 women with a mean age of 51.4 years duodenal ulcers were detected in 24 (53.3%) and gastric ulcers in 21 (46.7%). After one-month treatment of 53 duodenal ulcers 44 (83%) healed by a scars. Healing of small and medium sized defects was excellent, they healed in 93.6%, while large defects only in 33.3%. Of 43 gastric ulcers after one month treatment 31 healed (72.1%) by a scar. Small and medium-sized defects healed in 80.5% and large ones only in 28.6%. With the exception of one case all were in an advanced stage of healing with a tendency of complete healing with scare formation."
