DHEA (100 mg/day) or placebo was added to the routine medication protocol in a randomized, double blind controlled study. Follow-up for 12 months was conducted. Two separate DHEA-treated subgroups were identified by the Fuzzy clustering method: one showed statistically significant improvement in the severity of withdrawal symptoms, depression and anxiety scores (n=34; p<0.001 for all) and the other subgroup deteriorated in all measures (n=15). DHEA at the end of the detoxification program showed a tendency towards correlation with the duration of abstinence (r=0.6843; p>0.05; n=6), while a negative correlation was obtained with the cortisol level (r=-0.900; p=0.005, n=8). The completion-rate of the DHEA-improved subgroup was greater than in the DHEA-deteriorated subgroup (64.7% vs. 33.3%, respectively). The influence of supplementary DHEA treatment was mostly effective in heroin addicts who had not previously used either cocaine or benzodiazepines and who had experienced only few withdrawal programs.", 
    "1": "A combined physicochemical and 3D technique is used to establish the QSAR of four series of non-benzodiazepines towards BzR. In physicochemical QSAR study, the semi-empirical PM3 based parameters like hardness, electronegativity, electrophilicity index, molar refractivity, heat of formation, solvent assessable surface area and logP were used as descriptors. The heat of formation (HF) and logP are recognized as the most important descriptors for binding affinity of such compounds to BzR. The 3D QSAR study reveals that beta-Carbolines of series \"A\" and Imidazo[1, 2-alpha]pyrimidines of series \"C\" show steric bulk interaction, the beta-Carbolines of series \"B\" and di-substituted purines of series \"D\" have dominance of electrostatic interaction with BzR. The CoMSIA also indicate the same trend in terms of steric and electrostatic interaction. The CoMSIA reveals that only in case of series \"D\", the hydrophobic field effect is important. Some possible candidates for all four series were designed and their probable activities were estimated by using different QSAR models. The activities of designed molecules are in better range and developed models might be helpful to design the potent ligands of BzR.",

    "6": "We evaluated the prophylactic efficacy and the long-term tolerability of oxcarbazepine administration in the treatment of bipolar I and II disorder as an adjunctive therapy to lithium. We conducted a 52-wk, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, clinical trial. Bipolar I and II DSM-IV outpatients, having had two or more episodes in the last year, but currently being in remission, were randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to oxcarbazepine (n=26) or placebo (n=29) as adjuncts to ongoing treatment with lithium. The primary efficacy variable was the length of the remission period assessed by means of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Other assessments were the Clinical Global Impression (CGI-BP-M), functional activity (GAF), anxiety (HAMA) and impulsiveness (BIS-11). The average time until first recurrence of any type was 19.2+/-13.9 wk and 18.6+/-17.0 wk for oxcarbazepine and placebo respectively (p=0.315). Ten (38.46%) patients had a recurrence of any kind in the oxcarbazepine group vs. 17 (58.62%) in the placebo group (p=0.1354). There was a trend for depressive episodes being less likely in the oxcarbazepine group compared to the placebo group (11.54% and 31.03% respectively, p=0.085), and for better functionality with the GAF (p=0.074). Impulsivity was significantly better prevented by oxcarbazepine (p=0.0443). Overall, oxcarbazepine was well tolerated. This pilot, randomized clinical trial, suggests that oxcarbazepine might have some prophylactic efficacy with regards to impulsivity and perhaps mood episodes in patients taking lithium, although further, adequately powered controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

Fifty patients aged 15 to 43 years with newly diagnosed schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia were treated with RLAI 25 to 50 mg every 2 weeks for 2 years. Thirty-six patients (72%) completed the trial. Of 39 (78%) who showed a clinical response of 50%, 4 relapsed. Thirty-two patients (64%) achieved remission.

Prolactin levels were elevated in 18 patients, 4 of whom reported possible prolactin-related adverse events. Mean increase in body mass index to last visit for all patients was 4.8 kg/m (SD, 3.8 kg/m). The final RLAI dose was 25 mg for 54% of patients, 37.5 mg for 30%, and 50 mg for 16%.

Primary outcome measures were subjective assessments of sleep recorded on sleep diaries. Secondary measures were the morning-after psychomotor impairment, using the digit symbol substitution task and the manual tracking task, and the morning-after memory impairment, using a free-recall procedure. Results showed sleep improvements with 15 mg temazepam compared with placebo-sleep quality (mean score, 3.3 +/- 0.9 vs 2.9 +/- 0.8; P = 0.03), total sleep time (6.9 +/- 1.0 hours vs 6.3 +/-1.3 hours; P = 0.02), number of awakenings (1.5 +/- 1.3 vs 2.0 +/- 1.2; P < 0.001), and sleep-onset latency (25 +/- 22 minutes vs 37 +/- 25 minutes; P = 0.03). Improvements were seen with diphenhydramine treatment compared with placebo on the number of awakenings only (mean, 1.7 +/- 1.1 vs 2.0 +/- 1.2; P < 0.05). Numbers of adverse events reported were similar after all treatments, although there was 1 fall during temazepam treatment. Findings indicate that temazepam is more effective than diphenhydramine when compared with placebo at the doses tested, although this advantage is mitigated by the risk of falls associated with temazepam use. The choice of agent to use in the elderly must consider these relative benefits and risks.", 
    "19": "The purpose of the present study is to compare the efficacy of imipramine in the treatment of psychotic versus nonpsychotic depression. Previous studies report varying results of monotherapy with antidepressants in psychotic depression. Because psychotic depression is seriously underinvestigated, performing a post hoc analysis of randomized clinical trials consisting of both psychotic and nonpsychotic depressed patients may contribute to the discussion on the optimal treatment of depressed patients with mood-congruent psychotic features. A total of 112 patients diagnosed with major depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) (40 with psychotic depression and 82 without psychotic features) received treatment with imipramine for 6 weeks after a washout period of 7 days. Imipramine doses were adjusted to attain a predefined fixed plasma level. Treatment response was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). A logistic regression analysis showed a significantly larger reduction in HAM-D score in the sample with psychotic features compared with the nonpsychotic sample (regression coefficient, -3.47; SE, 1.7; P = 0.04). According to the primary outcome criterion, that is, the change in HAM-D score, imipramine was significantly more effective in the sample with psychotic depression compared with the nonpsychotic depressed patients. The contradiction between our results and those of several previous studies may be due to the fixed plasma level dosing of imipramine refraining from concurrent psychotropic medication or limiting our patient sample to patients with mood-congruent psychotic features.",

In the years between circa 1955 and 1975 this seems to have happened to one of the prime regulatory agencies of the US federal government: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Intent upon transforming itself from a traditional \"cop\" agency to a regulatory giant, the FDA campaigned systematically to bring down some safe and effective drugs. This article concentrates on hearings in the area of psychopharmacology regarding several antianxiety drugs, namely meprobamate (Miltown), chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium). In addition, from 1967 to 1973 this regulatory vengefulness occurred on a broad scale in the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI), an administrative exercise that removed from the market almost half of the psychopharmacopoeia.

GLT-1 has been implicated in diverse neurological disorders and in opioid dependence and withdrawal. It has been speculated that it might also be involved in the physical dependence and withdrawal of other abused drugs, but demonstration of this property can be difficult in mammalian models. Here, we demonstrate for the first time using a planarian model that ceftriaxone attenuates both the development of physical dependence and abstinence-induced withdrawal from cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and a benzodiazepine (clorazepate) in a concentration-related manner. These results suggest that physical dependence and withdrawal from several drugs involve a common - beta-lactam-sensitive - mechanism in planarians. If these findings can be shown to extend to mammals, beta-lactam antibiotics might represent a novel pharmacotherapy or adjunct approach for treating drug abuse or serve as a template for drug discovery efforts aimed at treating drug abuse, recovery from drug abuse, or ameliorating the withdrawal from chronic use of therapeutic medications.",

This study ascertained that mechanism-based inhibitors reported to induce drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in humans also caused MBI in rats. 2. Midazolam (MDZ), mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A in rats, and mibefradil, which showed the most intense time-dependent inhibition among the inhibitors tested, were selected as the probe and the inhibitor, respectively. Following pretreatment of mibefradil at 24 h before MDZ administration in rats, the C(max) and AUC values of MDZ were significantly elevated in comparison with the control. The free plasma concentration of mibefradil was substantially lower than the IC(50) value observed in the in vitro inhibition study, suggesting that the DDI was due to MBI. 3.

A high incidence of autoactivation (up to tenfold) and heteroactivation (by testosterone, up to 14-fold) among the major pathways was observed. CYP capacity (V(max)) was marginally lower and 'affinity' constants (K(M), S(50)) were marginally greater compared with cryopreserved hepatocytes. 3. Average intrinsic clearance (based on maximal clearance, CL(max)) was sevenfold lower than in cryopreserved hepatocytes (reflecting sensitivity of intrinsic clearance estimation in vitro to mechanistic parameter values, particularly those involving atypical kinetics), but scaled intrinsic clearances for fresh (and cryopreserved) hepatocytes were within the range previously determined in hepatic microsomes. 4.

    "64": "Providing adequate sedation in the neurologic intensive care unit (ICU) depends on determination of proper goals for sedation, adequate assessment of the level of sedation, and appropriate choice of drug based on the patient's physiology. The management of sedation in the ICU will influence long-term outcome. Delirium, anxiety, and pain must be identified and treated separately. The use of protocols can improve compliance with published evidence-based recommendations. Propofol and dexmedetomidine may be used for rapidly titratable sedation, benzodiazepines for anxiolysis, neuroleptics for treatment of delirium, and opiates for analgesia. Unique aspects of patients with acute brain disease, such as elevated intracranial pressure or status epilepticus, require adaptation of sedative regimens. Processed EEG monitoring and volatile anesthetic agents have not yet proven beneficial or practical for use in the ICU.", 
    "65": "The translocator protein (18 kDa; TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that associates with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore to regulate both steroidogenesis and apoptosis. TSPO expression is induced in adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury and a TSPO receptor ligand, Ro5-4864, enhances DRG neurite growth in vitro and axonal regeneration in vivo. We have now found that TSPO is induced in neonatal motor neurons after peripheral nerve injury and have evaluated its involvement in neonatal and adult sensory and motor neuron survival, and in adult motor neuron regeneration. The TSPO ligand Ro5-4864 rescued cultured neonatal DRG neurons from nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis and protected neonatal spinal cord motor neurons from death due to sciatic nerve axotomy. However, Ro5-4864 had only a small neuroprotective effect on adult facial motor neurons after axotomy, did not delay onset or prolong survival in SOD1 mutant mice, and failed to protect adult DRG neurons from sciatic nerve injury-induced death. In contrast, Ro5-4864 substantially enhanced adult facial motor neuron nerve regeneration and restoration of function after facial nerve axotomy. These data indicate a selective sensitivity of neonatal sensory and motor neurons to survival in response to Ro5-4864, which highlights that survival in injured immature neurons cannot necessarily predict success in adults. Furthermore, although Ro5-4864 is only a very weak promoter of survival in adult neurons, it significantly enhances regeneration and functional recovery in adults.",

A 78-year-old woman diagnosed as status epilepticus (SE) showed transient reduction in (123)I-iomazenil uptake within the epileptic foci on SPECT images during a couple of weeks. It suggests a seizure-related 'short-term' plasticity in the central benzodiazepine receptors and dynamic change in the regulatory mechanisms of inhibitory neurotransmitter system within the epileptic foci in patients with SE.",

The objective of the study was to assess the practice trends for administering sedation analgesia in non operative locations in Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi by anaesthetists. It was a descriptive study which retrospective reviewed anaesthesia records. A total of 41 ASA I-IV cases were reviewed. Non invasive cardiorespiratory monitoring and clinical sedation monitoring were applied. Intravenous Propofol infusion and midazolam boluses were used, singly or in combination with fentanyl boluses. All our patients recovered uneventfully within 5 minutes of the end of procedure. The practice trends for drug regimens are similar to those reported in recent literature. However we need to provide BIS monitoring, target controlled and patient maintained sedation to enhance patient and operator comfort.", 
    "68": "The purpose of this study was to measure the acute effects of lorazepam [a short-acting benzodiazepine (BZ) with no active metabolites] on orolingual motor function in young (6 months) versus aged (24 months) Fischer 344/Brown Norway hybrid (F344/BN) rats. Rats licked water from an isometric force-sensing operandum so that the number of licks per session, licking rhythm (licks/second), and lick force could be measured during daily sessions. Acute doses (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) of lorazepam were administered 30 min before the testing sessions, 4 days apart. Whereas aged rats produced more licks per session, lorazepam increased this measure primarily in the young group. On the days after each lorazepam dose, rats licked less than they did before receiving the drug. This effect was shown by both groups. Aged rats showed significantly slower licking rhythm than young rats. Lorazepam slowed this measure in both groups. Peak tongue forces were significantly increased by lorazepam. These findings suggest that BZs such as lorazepam can affect tongue force output and exacerbate age-related tongue motility deficits. They also suggest that although BZs can directly influence motivation to engage in water-reinforced tasks, opposite 'rebound' effects may occur, even after acute dosing.", 
    "69": "Antipsychotics constitute efficacious augmenting agents in the treatment of anxiety disorders, including refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. We examined the effects of 36 compounds, including typical, atypical and novel antipsychotics with dual dopamine D2/5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (D2/5-HT1A) actions on marble burying behavior in mice, a putative preclinical test for anxiety disorders. One hour after drug administration, male NMRI mice were placed individually in cages containing 20 marbles, and the total number of marbles buried after 30 min was counted. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, citalopram (2.5-40 mg/kg), fluoxetine (2.5-10 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg), reduced the number of buried marbles. The atypical antipsychotic, clozapine (0.16-10 mg/kg), but not its congener olanzapine, was effective in this test. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, also reduced the number of buried marbles, albeit not in a dose-dependent manner. The atypical risperidone was partially active (0.16-0.63 mg/kg), as was the benzamide derivative, amisulpride, albeit at high (10-40 mg/kg) doses. Among the 'third-generation' antipsychotics possessing combined D2/5-HT1A properties, bifeprunox was active at 0.0025 mg/kg, whereas SLV313 and aripiprazole were active only at the highest doses (2.5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). SSR181507, F15063 and the antidyskinetic agent, sarizotan, were without any effect. Among a series of receptor subtype-selective ligands, only the 5-HT1A agonist, (+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.63-2.5 mg/kg) and the 5-HT2A/2B/2C antagonist, ritanserin (0.63-2.5 mg/kg) were active. Among novel antipsychotics with dual D2/5-HT1A properties, only bifeprunox was able to potently reduce the number of buried marbles. Inhibition of marble burying behavior may result from the interplay of several receptor systems, including 5-HT2 receptor blockade, dopamine D2 partial agonism and serotonin 5-HT1A agonism.", 
    "70": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs), such as olanzapine, are associated with weight gain and hyperphagia in both humans and rodents. This side effect, however, is absent or reduced for AAPD such as ziprasidone. The increased levels of appetite seen in rodents may be related to drug interactions with brain histamine systems involved in appetite control. We demonstrate a significant interaction of olanzapine treatment with histamine neurotransmission in a rat-feeding paradigm measuring the consumption of a palatable fat emulsion. This interaction was identified using the H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide, which by blocking autoreceptor control of histaminergic neurons enhances release of hypothalamic histamine, causing hypophagia. We challenged this effect of thioperamide with olanzapine, which among its pharmacological actions is a potent H1 receptor antagonist. Olanzapine pretreatment significantly attenuated thioperamide-induced hypophagia. Pretreatment of thioperamide with ziprasidone, an AAPD with negligible H1 receptor affinity, however, failed to have this effect. Although thioperamide may also increase levels of neurotransmitters other than histamine, the potent H1 antagonist property of olanzapine is likely to result in the suppression of thioperamide-induced hypophagia. We conclude that olanzapine may be directly modulating histaminergic neurotransmission associated with the regulation of feeding behaviour.", 
    "71": "Enhanced sensitivity of analytical chemistry methods has enabled the detection of low-levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment, resulting in questions about the safety of surface waters used for drinking supplies. Human health risk assessments were performed to evaluate the risks from residues of atomoxetine, duloxetine, and olanzapine, which might be found in surface waters. Preclinical safety studies and human clinical data were used to determine an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for each compound: atomoxetine, 1.4 microg/kg/day; duloxetine, 1.8 microg/kg/day; and olanzapine, 1.4 microg/kg/day. The calculated predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for children were 25.7, 19.1, and 35.9 microg/L for atomoxetine, duloxetine, and olanzapine, respectively. Estimated exposure concentrations determined using United States Food and Drug Administration guidelines and predicted exposure concentrations from the PhATE model were compared with each PNEC to determine margins of safety, which ranged from 147 to 642. Based on currently available data used in this assessment, no appreciable human health risks exist from exposure to the highest 99th percentile of predicted residue levels of atomoxetine, duloxetine or olanzapine in surface waters under low-flow conditions.",

Ninety-seven per cent of all patients were prescribed PRN medications and 93.8% were prescribed regular medications. The most frequently prescribed medications were second-generation antipsychotics for regular use along with benzodiazepine for PRN use. Nearly 84% of patients received at least one PRN medication during their admission, while patients diagnosed with personality disorder received more PRNs per day. The most common reason for PRN administration was patient agitation. The results indicated poor documentation in the prescription and documentation of PRN administrations. Also, the findings show that a small subset of the patients (5%) received >30% of all PRN medications.", 
    "75": "PRN medication use has endured as standard practice and the results of the present study are consistent with the reported frequency of use increasing slightly over the years. The combination of second-generation antipsychotics as regular medications and benzodiazepines for PRN medication is consistent with recommended treatment guidelines. The small subset of patients who were overrepresented in the PRN administrations is noteworthy.", 
    "76": "Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is a major medical emergency, defined as severe form of SE that does not respond to first (benzodiazepines) and second (phenytoin, phenobarbital) treatment efforts with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Understanding the mechanisms of RSE is important to prevent or reverse its development. Based on both clinical experience and data from rat models of SE, seizures that last more than 30 min become very hard to control by AEDs. Experimental studies have shown that the prolonged seizures of SE lead to progressive alterations of GABAA receptors, including reduced surface expression of these receptors by receptor trafficking, which would explain the loss of efficacy of benzodiazepines. In addition to AED target alterations, SE-induced overexpression of drug efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), in the brain may be involved in the resistance to AEDs (including phenytoin and phenobarbital) that are Pgp substrates. However, recent experiments of our group did not indicate that Pgp plays any important role in drug resistance of SE. Improved understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AED resistance in SE will ultimately provide new treatment options for RSE.", 
    "77": "The intensive care unit management of status epilepticus focuses on patients who are refractory to initial treatment, who have an underlying condition that require critical care management, or who experience respiratory or cardiovascular complications of their therapies. The available data suggest that failure of a first-line anticonvulsant agent to terminate status should lead to the use of a definitive therapy in general anesthetic doses. Midazolam, propofol, and phenobarbital have been used most frequently; the place of newer agents (e.g., valproate, levetiracetam, or topiramate) remains to be determined.", 
    "78": "While the treatment of refractory status epilepticus (SE) relies on the use of anesthetic agents, mostly barbiturates, propofol, or midazolam, the study of the available literature discloses that the evidence level is low. Therapeutic coma induction appears straightforward for generalized convulsive or subtle SE, but this approach is debated for complex partial SE. Each anesthetic has its own advocates, and specific advantages and risks; furthermore, several different protocols have been reported regarding the duration and depth of sedation. However, it seems that the biological background of the patient (especially the etiology) remains the main prognostic determinant in SE. There is a clear need of controlled trials regarding this topic.",

Only 29.95% of subjects with a 12-month prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) had been taking antidepressants. After controlling for several clinical and non-clinical factors, help seeking for emotional problems was the most important independent predictor for the use of AD or BZD (OR: 13.58 and 5.17, respectively). Higher age was the second important predictor (OR: 6.52 and 4.86, respectively). A 12-month or lifetime prevalence of MDE or an anxiety disorder were also predictors for AD or BZD use (OR for MDE: 5.00 and 2.82, OR for anxiety disorders: 2.13 and 1.85). Finally, the presence of painful physical symptoms also predicted the use of AD and BZD, while female gender, lower education and higher age predicted only the use of BZD.",

    "87": "Herbal antidiabetic preparations are often used as an add-on therapy in diabetes and such herbal preparations often contains quercetin that can inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing pioglitazone, a commonly used antidiabetic agent. Hence, it was speculated that quercetin may influence the bioavailability of pioglitazone, which could be particularly crucial, as any increment in its plasma levels may raise safety concerns. Thus, we first established the inhibitory influence of quercetin (2, 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.) on CYP3A activity by an in vivo method of estimating levels of midazolam in female rats pretreated with dexamethasone. It was further confirmed in vitro using erythromycin-N-demethylase (EMD) assay. These studies indicated potent inhibition of CYP3A activity by quercetin (10 and 20 mg/kg, in vivo; 1 and 10 microM, in vitro). In another experiment, pioglitazone was administered orally (10 mg/kg) and intravenously (5mg/kg) to quercetin (10 mg/kg) pretreated female rats and its plasma levels were determined at various time points (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h after oral administration; 0.083, 0.5, 1, 2, 8, 12 and 18 h after i.v. administration) by HPLC. Quercetin pretreatment increased AUC(0-infinity) of pioglitazone after oral administration by 75% and AUC(0-infinity) after intravenous administration by 25% suggesting decreased metabolism, which could be due to inhibition of CYP3A by quercetin. In conclusion, add-on preparations containing quercetin may increase the bioavailability of pioglitazone, and hence should be cautiously used.", 
    "88": "In the CNS, steroid hormones play a major role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis and it's response to injury. Since activated microglia are the pivotal immune cell involved in neurodegeneration, we investigated the possibility that microglia provide a discrete source for the metabolism of active steroid hormones. Using RT-PCR, our results showed that mouse microglia expressed mRNA for 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and steroid 5alpha-reductase type 1, which are involved in the metabolism of androgens and estrogens. Microglia also expressed the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and steroid acute regulatory protein; however, the enzymes required for de novo formation of progesterone and DHEA from cholesterol were not expressed. To test the function of these enzymes, primary microglia cultures were incubated with steroid precursors, DHEA and AD. Microglia preferentially produced delta-5 androgens (Adiol) from DHEA and 5alpha-reduced androgens from AD. Adiol behaved as an effective estrogen receptor agonist in neuronal cells. Activation of microglia with pro-inflammatory factors, LPS and INFgamma did not affect the enzymatic properties of these proteins. However, PBR ligands reduced TNFalpha production signifying an immunomodulatory role for PBR. Collectively, our results suggest that microglia utilize steroid-converting enzymes and related proteins to influence inflammation and neurodegeneration within microenvironments of the brain.", 
    "89": "There is a growing body of data to support the notion that GABA(B) receptors may be a therapeutic target for anxiety disorders. However, the application of GABA(B) receptor agonists in anxiety research and psychiatry is hampered by side effects that include motor in-coordination and hypothermia. Recently the GABA(B) receptor positive modulator GS39783 was shown to be anxiolytic in rodent models, but was devoid of accompanying side effects characteristic of full agonists. However, it is important to test whether such anxiolytic effects generalise to another chemical class of GABA(B) receptor positive modulators. We therefore aimed to investigate the anxiolytic and side-effect profile of CGP7930, the first-reported GABA(B) receptor positive modulator, in rodent models of anxiety, motor coordination and hypothermia. CGP7930 (3-300 mg/kg) showed a modest, compared to the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (10mg/kg), dose-dependent anxiolytic profile in the mouse stress-induced hyperthermia (100mg/kg), staircase (100 and 300 mg/kg) and elevated zero maze tests (3-100mg/kg), but did not have any anxiolytic effects in the rat elevated plus maze. Similar to GS39783, CGP7930 also demonstrated a greatly reduced side-effect profile in comparison to the GABA(B) receptor full agonist baclofen in the mouse rotarod and traction wire tests and did not induce hypothermia. Although the effects of CGP7930 were modest, these results represent a second, structurally distinct, class of GABA(B) positive modulators showing anxiolytic activity. As such, these data support the premise that GABA(B) receptor positive modulation represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the development of anxiolytic drugs with a superior side-effect profile. The generation of more potent compounds is now warranted.",

Moreover the type of heteroaroyl ring at position 3 influences the feature of the substituent at position 8 to obtain high-affinity ligands: a 'hydrogen-bond acceptor ring' at position 3 is synergic with an electron donor substituent at position 8, while a 'hydrogen-bond donor ring' is synergic with a withdrawing substituent. Compounds 8a, 9b, and 11 were deeply studied in vivo for their pharmacological effects considering six potential benzodiazepine actions: motor coordination, anticonvulsant action, spontaneous motor activity and explorative activity, anxiolytic-like effects, mouse learning and memory modulation, and ethanol-potentiating action.

    "104": "In the rat, selective suppression of conditioned avoidance response has been widely reported as a test with high predictive validity for antipsychotic efficacy. Recent studies have shown that the relationship between dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and the suppression of conditioned avoidance response behaviour correlates well with the relationship between human dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and clinical effect. The aim of the present study was to evaluate how pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) predictions of therapeutic effective steady-state plasma levels by means of conditioned avoidance response behaviour in rodents, correlate with clinically relevant plasma exposure for the classical antipsychotic drug haloperidol and four second generation antipsychotics: sertindole, clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine, including selected metabolites. In order to confirm the validity of the present conditioned avoidance response procedure, in vivo striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy was determined in parallel using 3H-raclopride as the radioligand. The PK/PD relationship was established by modelling the time-response and time-plasma concentration data. We found the order of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy required to suppress conditioned avoidance response behaviour according to EC50 measurements to be sertindole (+dehydrosertindole)=dehydrosertindole=paliperidone (the metabolite of risperidone)=haloperidol=olanzapine>risperidone>clozapine. Overall, a good agreement was observed between the rat dopamine D2 receptor occupancy levels providing 50% response in the conditioned avoidance response test and the dopamine D2 receptor occupancy levels reported from responding schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. Predictions of therapeutically effective steady-state levels for sertindole (+dehydrosertindole) and olanzapine were 3-4-fold too high whereas for haloperidol, clozapine and risperidone the predicted steady-state EC50 in conditioned avoidance responding rats correlated well with the therapeutically effective plasma levels observed in patients. Accordingly, the proposed PK/PD model may act as a guide for determining effective plasma concentrations of potential antipsychotics in the clinical setting and thereby accelerating the overall drug development process.", 
    "105": "Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (EPM1, OMIM254800), is an autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by age of onset from 6 to 16 years, stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, and tonic-clonic epileptic seizures. Some years after the onset ataxia, incoordination, intentional tremor, and dysarthria develop. Individuals with EPM1 are mentally alert but show emotional lability, depression, and mild decline in intellectual performance over time. The diagnosis of EPM1 can be confirmed by identifying disease-causing mutations in a cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin B (CSTB) gene. Symptomatic pharmacologic and rehabilitative management, including psychosocial support, are the mainstay of EPM1 patients' care. Valproic acid, the first drug of choice, diminishes myoclonus and the frequency of generalized seizures. Clonazepam and high-dose piracetam are used to treat myoclonus, whereas levetiracetam seems to be effective for both myoclonus and generalized seizures. There are a number of agents that aggravate clinical course of EPM1 such as phenytoin aggravating the associated neurologic symptoms or even accelerating cerebellar degeneration. Sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) and GABAergic drugs (tiagabine, vigabatrin) as well as gabapentin and pregabalin may aggravate myoclonus and myoclonic seizures.

Hyperacusis (with or without Tinnitus, exacerbated by noise) (n = 8), 75% improved.", 
    "109": "Tinnitus is a symptom rather than an illness, and TRT gives patients greater control, allowing re-integration of normal perception. Night-time TRT is an effective treatment for Tinnitus and decreased sound tolerance. It has the potential advantage over day-time TRT of rapidly improving sleep and decreasing use of sedative hypnotics, a secondary effect noted in the personal testimonies of our cohort of patients. Further studies are needed to confirm this advantage, in view of the significant risks associated with long-term use of benzodiazepines. When investigating therapies for Tinnitus, it is necessary to measure success in terms of quality of life, as it is to this that the patient attaches the most importance.", 
    "110": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the anxiolytic effects of linalool and its potential interaction with the GABAA receptor in Sprague-Dawley rats. Lavender has been used traditionally as an herbal remedy in the treatment of many medical conditions, including anxiety. Linalool is a major component of the essential oil of lavender. Forty-four rats were divided into 4 groups: control, linalool, midazolam (positive control), and flumazenil and linalool. The behavioral and the neurohormonal/physiological components of anxiety were evaluated. The behavioral component was examined by using the elevated plus maze (open arm time/total time) and the neurohormonal/physiological component by measuring serum catecholamine and corticosterone levels. Data analysis was performed using a 2-tailed Multivariate Analysis of Variance and Sheffe post-hoc test. Our data suggest that linalool does not produce anxiolysis by modulation of the GABAA receptor; however, linalool may modulate motor movements and locomotion.", 
    "111": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the histologic modifications of rat articular capsules, after compression and strain. Fifty adults Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study. The rats were divided into 3 groups: a dysfunction group, treatment group and a Control group. In the rats in the first two groups an occlusion hump, made of composite and less than 0.5 mm high, was applied to the upper right molar. The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of benzodiazepine (0.5-1 mg for 100 g. of body weight). The composite used consisted of a hollow, plastic cylinder 0.5 mm high, spread over the whole occlusal surface of the right upper molar. The dysfunction group therapy wore the occlusion hump for a week, at the end of which the animals in this group were killed and their temporomandibular joint removed. In the treatment group a second occlusion hump was applied to the left upper molar, in order to obtain a distraction of the previously compressed temporomandibular joint. The rats of the second group wore the second occlusion hump for one week. The rats were then killed with an intraperitoneal injection of Tanax, and the block sections, containing the temporo-mandibolar joint, were retrieved with a diamond disk, and surrounding tissues were washed in saline solution and immediately fixed in 4 percent formalin for 4 days. In the control group, no treatment was applied. In the first group, bone resorption was observed in the left temporomandibular joint; no osteoclast were, however, present. No other tissue alterations were present. Newly formed bone undergoing remodelling was intensely stained with acid fuchsin. In the second and third groups, no bone remodelling areas were observed. In conclusion, the compression of the temporomandibular joint determined a remodelling of the bone structure of the condyle.",

Subsequently, their performance in the elevated plus maze (EPM) was studied for possible differences in anxiety-like behaviors. Finally, the effects of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), diazepam, d-amphetamine, and cocaine on individual differences in SIP were investigated.", 
    "115": "HD rats acquired SIP faster and reached higher asymptotic levels than LD. Nose pokes, however, were greater in LD. In the EPM, there were no differences between HD and LD animals. Gabaergic drug effects on SIP did not differ between HD and LD rats. Compared to saline, PTZ reduced and diazepam increased water SIP drinking. On the other hand, amphetamine dose-dependently reduced SIP in HD, whereas the highest dose was required to reduce SIP in LD. HD rats also showed reductions in SIP drinking after cocaine administration. However, the effects of these drugs on nose pokes did not differ between HD and LD.", 
    "116": "These data provide novel evidence that individual differences in SIP are not predictive of behavioral reactivity in animal models of anxiety and suggest an important role for the dopaminergic system in such individual differences. These findings point to SIP as a useful animal model for investigating the neurobiological basis of vulnerability to several psychopathologies in which the dopaminergic system is involved.", 
    "117": "Olanzapine (OLZ), one of the second-generation atypical antipsychotics (SGAs), has shown relative advantages in patient adherence and outcomes. However, OLZ has also been associated with a higher incidence of weight gain than most other SGAs. Excessive weight gain may in turn contribute to long-term health concerns for some individuals. Zonisamide (ZNS), a medication approved in the United States as an adjunct in the management of epilepsy, has a diverse pharmacological profile, including sodium channel blockade, monoamine enhancement, and inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. ZNS has also been reported to cause weight loss in both humans and rodents. We hypothesized that this profile might be beneficial when co-administered with OLZ. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of OLZ on body weight, as well as the pathways known to regulate feeding behavior and arousal in the Sprague-Dawley rat. As indicated via c-Fos expression, we found an OLZ-induced activation in the nucleus accumbens and orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. An OLZ-associated development of hyperphagia, weight gain and elevated blood glucose in the rat was also found. These outcomes were attenuated and reversed in the presence of concomitant ZNS. These results suggest the hypothesis that ZNS may effectively treat or prevent weight gain or metabolic changes associated with the SGAs. Future studies of this combination in patients through appropriately designed human clinical studies are encouraged.",

Treatment for 14 days or longer was required to induce significant apoptosis. The cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine were not significantly enhanced by addition of gamma-secretase inhibitors to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, but gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment sensitized cells to the effect of dexamethasone. NOTCH1 mutations were identified in all T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with ABL1 fusions and in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line expressing NUP214-ABL1. In this cell line, the anti-proliferative effect of imatinib was increased by pre-treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors.",

    "122": "Abnormality of P300 waveforms of event-related potentials (ERPs) has been suggested to represent an aspect of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous work points to the contribution of altered neural function in discrete brain regions in the left hemisphere to psychotic symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. In this study, we sought to determine: 1) if patients with schizophrenia elicit a decreased P300 current source density in brain areas, such as the superior temporal gyrus (STG); 2) if decreased P300 generator density in the left STG is recovered by treatment with the most widely-used antipsychotic drug olanzapine; and 3) if the recovery of P300 source density is associated with improvements of cognitive and functional status. P300 in response to an auditory oddball task, as well as verbal learning memory, psychopathology, and quality of life were evaluated in 16 right-handed patients with schizophrenia before and after treatment with olanzapine for 6 months. ERP data were also obtained from 16 right-handed age and gender-matched normal volunteers. Low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis was used to obtain current density images of P300. Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly smaller LORETA values in several brain regions in the left side, particularly STG, middle frontal gyrus, and precentral gyrus, compared with control subjects. Six-month treatment with olanzapine significantly increased P300 source density only in the left STG. Positive symptoms, negative symptoms, verbal learning memory, and quality of life were also improved during treatment. Significant correlations were found between the increase in LORETA values of left STG vs. improvements of negative symptoms, as measured by Scale for the Assessment of the Negative Symptoms, and verbal learning memory, as measured by the Japanese Verbal Learning Test. Improvement of quality of life, as evaluated by the Quality of Life Scale, were significantly associated with an increase in LORETA values of middle frontal gyrus, and tended to correlate with that of precentral gyrus. The results of this study suggest that changes in cortical activity, as measured by ERPs, are responsible for the ability of some antipsychotic drugs to improve cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "123": "The promise of subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor drugs with anxiolytic properties but with a much reduced side-effect burden (compared to benzodiazepines) is an attainable goal. However, its achievement necessitates the availability of in vivo preclinical assays capable of demonstrating differences as well as similarities between subtype-selective agents and non-selective benzodiazepines. In this study, we have compared three mouse strains (NMRI, C57BL/6J and DBA/2) in four models of anxiety-like behaviour (plus-maze, zero-maze, light-dark, and Vogel conflict). Furthermore, in each model, we have contrasted in detail the behavioural responses of each strain to the non-selective benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 5-20 mg/kg), and the subtype-selective agents L-838,417 (GABA(A)-alpha(2/3/5); 3-30 mg/kg) and zolpidem (GABA(A)-alpha1; 0.3-3.0 mg/kg). The data show a complex mouse strainxmodelxpharmacological agent interaction. Most importantly, not all mouse strainxmodel test systems showed a positive response to CDP or predicted the response to L-838,417. This dissociation between CDP and L-838,417 opens up opportunities for preclinical test systems that differentiate subtype-selective and non-selective GABA(A) receptor agents, an attribute that might well be important in providing the necessary confidence for further drug development. Present findings suggest the need for a much greater focus on defining test systems appropriate for screening novel chemical entities, rather than self-selection of models or genotypes based on responses to known pharmacological agents. For example, if current data with L-838,417 are confirmed with compounds showing similar selectivity profiles, such agents may in future be best identified and characterised using test systems comprising NMRI mice in the zero-maze and/or C57 mice in the Vogel conflict and/or light-dark tests.", 
    "124": "Results from a variety of independently run experiments suggest that latent inhibition (LI) and the partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) share underlying mechanisms. Experiment 1 tested this LI=PREE hypothesis by training the same set of rats in situations involving both nonreinforced preexposure to the conditioned stimulus (LI stage) and partial reinforcement training (PREE stage). Control groups were also included to assess both LI and the PREE. The results demonstrated a significant, but negative correlation between the size of the LI effect and that of the PREE. Experiment 2 extended this analysis to the effects on LI and the PREE of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Whereas chlordiazepoxide had no effect on LI, it delayed the onset of the PREE. No evidence in support of the LI=PREE hypothesis was obtained when these two learning phenomena were compared within the same experiment and under the same general conditions of training.", 
    "125": "Nausea and vomiting are symptoms resulting from a triggered emetic reflex. Many endogenous and exogenous triggering factors can activate the emetic reflex, making understanding difficult and therapy challenging. The key to managing most cases of nausea and vomiting lies in a good history and a detailed physical examination. Most episodes of acute vomiting (lasting < 48 hours) have an evident triggering factor (eg, infection, viral illness, or food poisoning) and can be managed by removing the triggering agent and via supportive therapy. Chronic and unexplained nausea and vomiting can be a challenge. The cause is often obscure and requires special investigation. Functional gastroduodenal disorders such as cyclic vomiting syndrome, functional vomiting, and chronic idiopathic nausea should be considered if investigations are unrevealing. Knowledge regarding various emetic pathways and the specific neurotransmitters involved helps to target therapy. Histamine-1 receptor antagonists and muscarinic antagonists are suitable candidates for motion sickness and labyrinthine disorders. Phenothiazines, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and benzodiazepines have a role in postchemotherapy and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Cannabinoid and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are best reserved for refractory cases of nausea and vomiting. Motilin agonists and metoclopramide are useful for treating impaired gastric motility disorders.", 
    "126": "Herbicides (benzodiazepinediones), insecticides (dioxatricyclododecenes) and larvicides (N-oxalyl derivatives of tebufenozide) have been quantitatively investigated to explore the relationship between the molecular structure and their biological activity using molecular operating environment (MOE) software. The study provides good predictive models, cross-validated by leave-out-one method (Loo). The positive contribution of the descriptor n-O (count of oxygen atom) suggests the additional oxygen atom substitution at R1 position, in addition to benzodiazepine moiety is favorable for herbicidal activity, whereas the negative contribution of y component of dipole moment (Dip(y)) indicates that electronic interactions are also crucial for the activity. The negative correlation of V(SA)2 and globularity (Glo) descriptors clearly indicates that the volume, shape, and rigidity of tebufenozide derivatives determine their larvicidal activity. The biparametric model for insecticides shows that the indicator variable l(CH-CH3) and R(PC) (negative partial charge) are detrimental for its activity. Most of the active compounds in the series have shown less value for these descriptors. The derived QSAR models also provide valuable insights to optimize their toxicity, which remains a major concern for environment safety.",

After the description of DSM-IV diagnosis criteria of panic disorders, this paper underline the importance of an adequate somatic and psychiatric differential diagnosis. Even if cognitive-behavioural therapy is the best studied psychotherapeutical approach, several efficacious psychodynamic psychotherapies were also described. High-potency benzodiazepines provide a rapid efficacy with beneficial effects during the first days of treatment. However, benzodiazepines should be avoided in the long term, because of the development of tolerance and dependence. Antidepressants (SSRI, venlafaxine) are effective in preventing panic attacks, especially in improving anticipatory anxiety and avoidance behaviour.", 
    "128": "Sarin, a potent cholinesterase inhibitor, induces an array of toxic effects including convulsions and behavioral impairments. We report here on the protection provided by post-exposure antidotal treatments against a lethal dose of sarin (1.2xLD50) by scopolamine, benactyzine, trihexyphenidyl or caramiphen, administered 5, 10 or 20 min after the initiation of convulsions. A mixture of the oxime TMB4 and atropine (TA) was injected 1 min following poisoning a paradigm that may represent a scenario reminiscent of a terror incident. Surviving TA-treated rats exhibited marked tonic-clonic convulsions, weight loss, poor clinical status and abnormal cognitive performance as assessed by the Morris water maze. Additionally, a dramatic increase in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs), a faithful marker for neuronal damage, was noted. Animals treated 5 min after the development of toxic signs with benactyzine, trihexyphenidyl or caramiphen demonstrated control levels of PBR values, whereas scopolamine produced binding densities significantly above basal levels. Examined at the 10-min time point, scopolamine and trihexyphenidyl afforded no protection against brain damage and did not differ from TA-injected rats. All four drugs failed to significantly prevent the alterations when applied 20 min after onset of convulsions. Assessment of learning processes yielded similar results, where caramiphen exibited some protection at the 20-min time point. Our results show that caramiphen and benactyzine, agents with combined anticholinergic and antiglutamatergic pharmacological profiles, offer considerable shielding against sarin, even when their administration is delayed.",

    "133": "Nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP)-receptor agonists have been shown to produce anxiolytic-like effects in rodents subjected to various behavioral assays. Recently, we developed a new nonpeptide agonist of the NOP receptor, 1-[1-(1-methylcyclooctyl)-4-piperidinyl]-2-[(3R)-3-piperidinyl]-1H-benzimidazole (MCOPPB), as an anxiolytic agent. MCOPPB has a high affinity for the human NOP receptor (pKi = 10.07 +/- 0.01) and selectivity for the NOP receptor over other members of the opioid receptor family: 12-, 270- and >1000-fold more selective for the NOP receptor than for the micro-, kappa-, and delta-receptor, respectively. In an ex vivo binding study, MCOPPB (10 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited signaling through the NOP receptor in the mouse brain, suggesting that it penetrated into the brain after it was orally administered. In the mouse Vogel conflict test, MCOPPB (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (3 mg/kg, p.o.) elicited anxiolytic-like effects, although MCOPPB produced a bell-shaped response curve. In addition, MCOPPB (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was still effective as an anxiolytic agent even after repeated administration for 5 days. MCOPPB at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg did not affect locomotor activity or memory, nor did it contribute to ethanol-induced hypnosis. On the other hand, the benzodiazepine-type anxiolytic agent diazepam caused memory deficits and enhanced ethanol-induced hypnosis. These findings suggest that MCOPPB - a compound with few adverse effects on the central nervous system - is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of anxiety.",

    "148": "Schizophrenia is widely acknowledged as being a syndrome, consisting of an undefined number of diseases probably with differing pathologies. Although studying a syndrome makes the identification of an underlying pathology more difficult; neuroimaging, neuropsychopharmacological and post-mortem brain studies all implicate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM) in the pathology of the disorder. We have established that the CHRM1 is selectively decreased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia. To expand this finding, we wanted to ascertain whether decreased cortical CHRMs might (1) define a subgroup of schizophrenia and/or (2) be related to CHRM1 genotype. We assessed cortical [(3)H]pirenzepine binding and sequenced the CHRM1 in 80 subjects with schizophrenia and 74 age sex-matched control subjects. Kernel density estimation showed that [(3)H]pirenzepine binding in BA9 divided the schizophrenia, but not control, cohort into two distinct populations. One of the schizophrenia cohorts, comprising 26% of all subjects with the disorder, had a 74% reduction in mean cortical [(3)H]pirenzepine binding compared to controls. We suggest that these individuals make up 'muscarinic receptor-deficit schizophrenia' (MRDS). The MRDS could not be separated from other subjects with schizophrenia by CHRM1 sequence, gender, age, suicide, duration of illness or any particular drug treatment. Being able to define a subgroup within schizophrenia using a central biological parameter is a pivotal step towards understanding the biochemistry underlying at least one form of the disorder and may represent a biomarker that can be used in neuroimaging.",

On multivariate analysis, only LD (P equals .02) and POS (P equals .01) retained significance, with LD more and POS less likely to predict appropriateness. Seven of 11 patients who experienced adverse events had received STT according to the CIWA-Ar protocol (P equals .05).

Sleep induces physiologic alterations in respiratory function, which can become pathologic and may provoke or worsen hypoxemia and hypercapnia in COPD. Dyspnea, cough and excessive mucus production should be optimised to minimise causes for sleep disturbance. Pharmacological therapy may be helpful; sedatives like benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine-receptor agonists (NBBRAs) are (equally) effective in improving sleep quality. Whether or not these hypnotics produce serious adverse respiratory effects during sleep, remains unclear due to opposing studies. Therefore, their use should be as short as possible.", 
    "158": "Mice with point-mutated alpha2 GABA(A) receptor subunits (rendering them diazepam insensitive) are resistant to the anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines (BZs) in the conditioned emotional response (CER) test, but show normal anxiolytic effects of a barbiturate. We investigated the consequence of deleting the alpha2-subunit on acquisition of the CER with increasing intensity of footshock, and on the anxiolytic efficacy of a benzodiazepine, diazepam, and a barbiturate, pentobarbital. alpha2 knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice were trained in a conditioned emotional response (CER) task, in which lever pressing for food on a variable interval (VI) schedule was suppressed during the presentation of a compound light/tone conditioned stimulus (CS+) that predicted footshock. The ability of diazepam and of pentobarbital to reduce suppression during the CS+ was interpreted as an anxiolytic response. There were no differences between the genotypes in shock sensitivity, as assessed by their flinch responses to increasing levels of shock. However, alpha2 KO mice showed a greater suppression of lever pressing than WT littermates in the presence of a compound cue signalling footshock. Diazepam (0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effect in WT mice but no such effect was seen in KO mice. Similarly, although pentobarbital (20 mg/kg) reduced the ability of the CS+ to reduce lever pressing rates in WT mice, this effect was not seen in the KO. These findings suggest that alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors mediate the anxiolytic effects of barbiturates, as well as benzodiazepines, and that they may be involved in neuronal circuits underlying conditioned anxiety.",

    "160": "First-episode patients with schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day), quetiapine (100-800 mg/day), or risperidone (0.5-4 mg/day) as part of a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, multicenter study. Patients were enrolled from 2002 to 2004 at one of 26 sites in the United States and Canada. Survival analysis tested for predictors of treatment discontinuation against medical advice, while mixed models tested for predictors of poor medication adherence. Significant findings from the final models were replicated in sensitivity analyses.", 
    "161": "Of the 400 patients randomly assigned to treatment, 115 patients who discontinued treatment against medical advice and 119 study completers were compared in this analysis. Poor treatment response (p < .001) and low medication adherence (p = .02) were independent predictors of discontinuation against medical advice. Ongoing substance abuse, ongoing depression, and treatment response failure significantly predicted poor medication adherence (p < .01). Higher cognitive performance at baseline and ethnicity (black) were also associated with lower medication adherence (p < .05). An association between poor medication adherence and illness insight at study entry was found at trend level (p = .059).", 
    "162": "This study highlights the importance of treatment response in predicting discontinuation against medical advice and poor adherence to medication in first-episode patients. These results also support interventions to improve adherence behavior, particularly by targeting substance use disorders and depressive symptoms.",

    "164": "Depression and anxiety are disabling disorders that affect many individuals. Drugs that interfere with the reuptake and/or metabolism of biogenic amines have been used to treat depression for more than four decades. An important development in the treatment of depression has been the emergence of triple reuptake inhibitors (SNDRIs), which inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Preclinical and clinical research indicates that drugs inhibiting the reuptake of all of these neurotransmitters can produce a more rapid onset of action and greater efficacy than traditional antidepressants. Allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors can produce anxiolytic, sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic effects, presumably from enhancing the inhibitory neurotransmission of GABAA through a facilitation of receptor function. Benzodiazepines have been used with great success as anxiolytics, but the use of these drugs is limited because of their addictive potential and sedative side effects. This feature review discusses the design and synthesis of antidepressants based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression, and presents the current status of research on GABAA receptor modulators as a potential treatment for anxiety disorders.", 
    "165": "Neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor (NPSR) comprise a recently deorphaned G protein-coupled receptor system. Recent reports implicate NPS in the mediation of anxiolytic-like activity in rodents.", 
    "166": "To extend the characterization of NPS, the present studies examined the in vitro pharmacology of mouse NPSR and the in vivo pharmacology of NPS in three preclinical mouse models predictive of anxiolytic action: the four-plate test (FPT), elevated zero maze (EZM), and stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH). The ability of NPS to produce antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test (TST) was also investigated.", 
    "167": "In vitro, mouse NPS 1-20 (mNPS 1-20) and the C-terminal glutamine-truncated mouse NPS 1-19 bound mNPSR with high affinity (Ki = 0.203 +/- 0.060, 0.635 +/- 0.141 nM, respectively) and potently activated intracellular calcium release (EC50 = 3.73 +/- 1.08, 4.10 +/- 1.25 nM). NPS produced effects in vivo consistent with anxiolytic-like activity. In FPT, NPS increased punished crossings (minimal effective dose [MED]: mNPS 1-20 = 0.2 microg, mNPS(1-19) = 0.02 microg), similar to the reference anxiolytic, alprazolam (MED 0.5 microg). NPS increased the percentage of time spent in the open quadrants of EZM (MED: mNPS 1-20 = 0.1 microg, mNPS 1-19 = 1.0 microg), like the reference anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (MED 56 microg). In SIH, NPS attenuated stress-induced increases in body temperature similar to alprazolam but with a large potency difference between the NPS peptides (MED: mNPS 1-20 = 2.0 microg, mNPS 1-19 = 0.0002 microg) and mNPS 1-20 increased baseline temperature. Unlike fluoxetine, NPS did not effect immobility time in TST, indicating a lack of antidepressant-like activity.", 
    "168": "These data provide an important confirmation and expansion of the anxiolytic-like effects of NPS and implicate the NPS system as a novel target for anxiolytic drug discovery.", 
    "169": "Signs characteristic of opiate withdrawal symptoms can be precipitated by an opiate antagonist after short-term infusion or even a single dose of an opiate both in humans and in animals. This phenomenon has been referred to as acute dependence. In contrast to extensive studies on chronic dependence, less is known about the neural mechanisms mediating acute dependence. It will benefit the development of appropriate therapies to facilitate opiate abstinence and reduced craving to better understand the mechanisms underlying acute opiate dependence and to determine whether there are dissociation and similarity between the early and fully developed stages of dependence. In the present study, we examined the influence of c-Fos expression in the amygdala in acquisition of conditioned place aversion (CPA) induced by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from a single morphine exposure 24 h earlier. The effect of microinjection into the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) of various kinds of glutamatergic neurotransmission inhibitors was also investigated. Findings showed that CeA displayed significant increase in c-Fos expression in the acquisition of CPA. Furthermore, CPA was attenuated significantly and dose-dependently by microinjection into CeA of all glutamatergic neurotransmission inhibitors (NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801), AMPA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI52466), metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (+/-)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), and glutamate release inhibitor riluzole). These findings suggest that CeA involves the acquisition of CPA induced by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from a single morphine exposure, and the function of the glutamatergic system projected from the amygdala to nucleus accumbens plays a facilitative role in formation of morphine dependence.", 
    "170": "Asenapine is a novel psychopharmacologic agent under development for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We determined and compared the human receptor binding affinities and functional characteristics of asenapine and several antipsychotic drugs. Compounds were tested under comparable assay conditions using cloned human receptors. In comparison with the antipsychotics, asenapine showed high affinity and a different rank order of binding affinities (pKi) for serotonin receptors (5-HT1A [8.6], 5-HT1B [8.4], 5-HT2A [10.2], 5-HT2B [9.8], 5-HT2C [10.5], 5-HT5 [8.8], 5-HT6 [9.6] and 5-HT7 [9.9]), adrenoceptors (alpha1 [8.9], alpha2A [8.9], alpha2B [9.5] and alpha2C [8.9]), dopamine receptors (D1 [8.9], D2 [8.9], D3 [9.4] and D4 [9.0]) and histamine receptors (H1 [9.0] and H2 [8.2]). It had much lower affinity (pKi<or=5) for muscarinic receptors and was the only agent with affinity for H2 receptors. Relative to its D2 receptor affinity, asenapine had a higher affinity for 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7, 5-HT6, alpha2B and D3 receptors, suggesting stronger engagement of these targets at therapeutic doses. Asenapine behaved as a potent antagonist (pKB) at 5-HT1A (7.4), 5-HT1B (8.1), 5-HT2A (9.0), 5-HT2B (9.3), 5-HT2C (9.0), 5-HT6 (8.0), 5-HT7 (8.5), D2 (9.1), D3 (9.1), alpha2A (7.3), alpha2B (8.3), alpha2C (6.8) and H1 (8.4) receptors. These functional effects differed from those of risperidone (pKB<5 for 5-HT6) and olanzapine (pKB<5 for 5-HT1A and alpha2). Our results indicate that asenapine has a unique human receptor signature, with binding affinity and antagonistic properties that differ appreciably from those of antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "171": "Little is known about the use of antipsychotics in pregnancy and the corresponding plasma levels in the newborn child. We report on a woman with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine during pregnancy. Plasma levels of olanzapine were assessed both from the mother and from umbilical cord. The plasma level of the newborn (11 ng/mL) was about one third compared to the mother (range 25-34 ng/mL).The development of the fetus, delivery and the development of the child during the first six months were normal."
