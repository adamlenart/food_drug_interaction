    "0": "Brain cholesterol synthesis inhibition (CSI) at a young age in rats has been shown to be a faithful model of acquired absence epilepsy, a devastating condition for which few therapies or models exist. We employed the CSI model to study cellular mechanisms of acquired absence epilepsy in Long-Evans Hooded rats. Patch-clamp, whole-cell recordings were compared from neurons acutely dissociated from the nucleus reticularis of thalamus (nRt) treated and untreated with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, U18666A. In U18666A-treated animals, 91% of rats developed EEG spike-waves (SWs). Patchclamp results revealed that although there was no remarkable change in GABAA receptor affinity, both a loss of ability of benzodiazepines to enhance GABAA-receptor responses and an increase of Zn2+ inhibition of GABAA-receptor responses of nRt neurons occurred in Long-Evans Hooded rats previously administered U18666A. This change was specific, since no significant changes were found in neurons exposed to the GABA allosteric modulator, pentobarbital. Taken collectively, these findings provide evidence for abnormalities in benzodiazepine and Zn2+ modulation of GABAA receptors in the CSI model, and suggest that decreased gamma2 subunit expression may underlie important aspects of generation of thalamocortical SWs in atypical absence seizures. The present results are also consistent with recent findings that mutation of the gamma2 subunit of the GABAA receptor changes benzodiazepine modulation in families with generalized epilepsy syndromes.", 
    "1": "The hippocampal CA1 sector is especially vulnerable to brief forebrain ischemia. Excitotoxicity is widely thought to contribute to this cell death. Accordingly, drugs that presumably counteract excitotoxicity, such as GABAergic agonists, have been repeatedly tested and found to reduce CA1 cell loss. Post-ischemic diazepam reduces CA1 injury. However, diazepam also causes hypothermia, which by itself is neuroprotective. Most studies fail to adequately control for this confound. In this study, we tested whether diazepam reduces injury in temperature controlled gerbils subjected to brief forebrain ischemia. Furthermore, we tested whether diazepam augments hypothermic neuroprotection. All gerbils were implanted with a core temperature telemetry probe and a cannula for the subsequent insertion of a thermocouple probe to measure ischemic brain temperature. Subsequently, they were given a 5-min normothermic ischemic insult. In Experiment 1, two groups of gerbils were given 10 mg/kg doses of diazepam (i.p.) at both 30 and 90 min post-ischemia. Temperature was maintained in one group by heating lamps. Another group was administered saline. Diazepam reduced cell death at 7 days post-ischemia when the drug-induced hypothermia was permitted, but not when it was prevented. In Experiment 2, four groups of ischemic gerbils were treated starting at 12 h post-ischemia with prolonged hypothermia, diazepam and the combination or saline treatment. Hypothermia, but not diazepam, provided partial neuroprotection and diazepam did not augment hypothermic neuroprotection. Thus, neuroprotection with diazepam is solely due to hypothermia. These data do not support the clinical use of diazepam as a neuroprotectant after global ischemia.", 
    "2": "Studies of the pharmacology of trigeminocervical neurons with input from intracranial pain-producing structures have enhanced the understanding of the basic neurobiology of primary headache, such as migraine. Clinical observations of the treatment of migraine with medicines acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABAA receptor have lead to studies of their effects on models of trigeminovascular nociception. Extracellular recordings were made from neurons in the trigeminocervical complex activated by supramaximal electrical stimulation of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in the cat. Intravenous administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of superior sagittal sinus evoked trigeminocervical nucleus activity. The inhibition at 50 microg/kg midazolam was 65+/-11% compared to the baseline response (n=11). Intravenous administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, resulted in a dose-dependent recovery of superior sagittal sinus evoked trigeminocervical nucleus activity. At a dose of 50 microg/kg, there was a 64+/-5% recovery (n=6). The data demonstrate a potent, reproducible effect of facilitation of GABA transmission at the GABAA receptor that results in inhibition of trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission. These data are consistent with the useful clinical effects reported with compounds that can augment GABAergic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS).",

Data on the following outcome measures were considered: sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse effects and rebound insomnia. A search was also undertaken for any study designs that evaluated issues related to adverse events (e.g. dependency and withdrawal symptoms). Full economic evaluations that compared two or more options and considered both costs and consequences including cost-effectiveness, cost-utility analysis or cost-benefit analysis undertaken in the context of high-quality RCTs were considered for inclusion in the review.", 
    "6": "Twenty-four studies, involving a total study population of 3909 patients, met the inclusion criteria. These included 17 studies comparing a Z-drug with a benzodiazepine and seven comparing a Z-drug with another Z-drug. The diversity of possible comparisons and the range of outcome measures in the review may be confusing. Outcomes were rarely standardised and, even when reported, differed in interpretation. In addition, variations in assessment and variety in the level of information provided make study comparisons difficult. As a result, meta-analysis has been possible on only a small number of outcomes. However, some broad conclusions might be reached based on the limited data provided. The existing published economic literature in this area is very limited. No relevant economic evaluations were identified for inclusion in the review. The industry submissions did not include detailed evidence of cost-effectiveness. Given the lack of robust clinical evidence, no economic model describing the costs and benefits of the newer hypnotic drugs for insomnia was developed. The systematic review provided in this report suggests that an agnostic approach to cost-effectiveness is required at this stage. In the short-term, no systematic evidence is available concerning significant outcome variations between either the different classes of drugs or between individual drugs within each class. Within this short-term horizon, the one element that does vary significantly is the acquisition cost of the individual drugs.", 
    "7": "The short-acting drugs seem equally effective and safe with minor differences that may lead a prescriber to favour one over another in different patients. There is no evidence that one is more cost-effective than any other. Analysis of the additional costs to the NHS, depending on the rate of change from benzodiazepine prescriptions to Z-drug prescriptions, at current levels of hypnotic prescribing, range from GBP2 million to GBP17 million per year. There are clear research needs in this area; in particular, none of the existing trials adequately compare these medications. It is suggested that further consideration should be given to a formal trial to allow head-to-head comparison of some of the key drugs in a double-blind RCT lasting at least 2 weeks, and of sufficient size to draw reasonable conclusions. We would also recommend that any such trial should include a placebo arm. It should also collect good-quality data around sleep outcomes and in particular quality of life and daytime drowsiness. We do not believe that any formal study of risk of dependency is feasible at present. Finally, the management of long-term insomnia is suggested for further investigation: considering the frequency of this symptom and its recurring course, the short-term trial of medication and lack of long-term follow-up undermine attempts to develop evidence-based guidelines for the use of hypnotics in this condition, or indeed for its whole management.",

    "18": "There is evidence that the septohippocampal cholinergic system is activated in response to stressful stimuli. In addition, prior studies indicate that stimulating the hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission increases open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze. This raises the possibility that exposing the rat to an elevated platform, which would be similar to confining the animal to the open arms of the plus-maze, would alter hippocampal acetylcholine levels. Results from the present study suggest that an elevated platform can be used as an animal model of stress in that exposure to the platform significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels. Importantly, exposure to a platform significantly increased hippocampal acetylcholine efflux. Interestingly, the increase in plasma corticosterone and hippocampal acetylcholine levels upon exposure to an elevated platform could be prevented by chlordiazepoxide at a dose that had no effect on basal hippocampal acetylcholine or plasma corticosterone levels. However, the elevated platform-induced increase in hippocampal acetylcholine could not be blocked by prior administration of buspirone. These results provide direct evidence for the importance of the hippocampal cholinergic system in stress and provide validation for the elevated platform as a model of stress.", 
    "19": "Benzodiazepines are often used for the treatment of epilepsy, convulsions, and many psychiatric disorders. The widespread use of this class of drugs has occasionally raised concern about recreational benzodiazepine abuse and has led to the erroneous impression that benzodiazepines have a relatively high abuse liability among recreational drug users. Therefore, the separation and identification of these compounds is of great interest. In general, the separation of benzodiazepines is performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Recently, capillary electrochromatography, which combines the high efficiency of capillary zone electrophoresis and the high selectivity of HPLC, has gained much attention. The focus of the work reported here is the use of a 40-cm packed bed of Reliasil 3- microm C(18) stationary phase to separate seven benzodiazepines. Optimal conditions are established by varying the mobile phase, amount of organic modifier, buffer concentration, applied voltage, and column temperature. A mobile phase composition of Tris-HCl (pH 8)-acetonitrile (60:40), an electrolyte concentration of 30mM, and a temperature of 15 degrees C with an applied voltage of 20 kV proves to be optimum. In addition, the method developed here is applied to the characterization of oxazepam in a standard urine sample.",

    "32": "Rats undergoing extinction of lever-pressing for food after the attenuation of an external feedback for this behavior, exhibit excessive lever-pressing unaccompanied by an attempt to collect a reward, which may be analogous to the excessive and unreasonable behavior seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Given that one of the most salient features of OCD is its selective response to treatment with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SRIs), the present study compared the effects of the SRIs paroxetine and fluvoxamine on compulsive lever-pressing, with those of the tricyclic antidepressant, desipramine, and the benzodiazepine, diazepam, which are not effective in the treatment of OCD. Paroxetine (1-15 mg/kg) and fluvoxamine (10-20 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced the number of compulsive lever-presses and the number of lever-presses followed by an attempt to collect a reward; desipramine (5-15 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced only the number of lever-presses followed by an attempt to collect a reward; diazepam (2-10 mg/kg) did not affect either type of lever-pressing, except for the highest dose (10 mg/kg), which almost completely abolished lever-press responding. When administered in an extinction session not preceded by signal attenuation, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and desipramine affected only the number of lever-presses followed by an attempt to collect a reward, whereas diazepam (4-8 mg/kg) decreased both types of lever-presses. The present findings strengthen the suggestion that compulsive lever-pressing may serve to model compulsive behavior in OCD, and lends the model predictive validity.", 
    "33": "Relatively little is known about the role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in extinction of appetitively motivated tasks. The benzodiazepine (BZ) chlordiazepoxide (CDP) was administered during extinction and re-acquisition of lever pressing by mice following food reinforced discrete-trial fixed-ratio 5 (FR-5) training. Typical FR behaviour was established during baseline training and persisted for several extinction sessions. There were 15 extinction sessions in all, followed by six re-acquisition sessions where food reinforcement was re-introduced. In a 2x2x2 between-group design, CDP (15 mg/kg) or vehicle injections were given prior to either the last two food reinforcement sessions and the first 10 extinction sessions, or the final five extinction sessions, or the six re-acquisition sessions. Initially CDP had no effect on the rate of extinction, but after several extinction sessions it significantly facilitated it. Surprisingly, if CDP was administered only after several sessions of extinction, it immediately produced facilitation. Thus the delayed effects of CDP are not due to drug accumulation. These data suggest that some neural change must occur before CDP can affect extinction processes. In re-acquisition sessions, CDP facilitated the reinstatement of food-reinforced lever pressing. Implications for neural and behavioural accounts of operant extinction are discussed.", 
    "34": "Previous studies have shown that low-efficacy benzodiazepines may function as full agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, depending upon the sensitivity of the assay to detect a drug's agonist effects. To date, these differential effects have only been observed across tasks, as these drugs rarely produce full agonist and antagonist effects in a single preparation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the agonist and antagonist effects of various benzodiazepines in a motor task in which the sensitivity of the task differed across conditions. To this end, rats were trained to walk on a rotorod apparatus rotating at low (4 rpm), medium (20 rpm) and high (36 rpm) speeds, and the motor-impairing effects of representative low (bretazenil), intermediate (clonazepam) and high (diazepam) efficacy benzodiazepines were examined. Diazepam and clonazepam reduced the latency for rats to fall from the rotorod at all three speeds, with both drugs being more potent at the high speed than at lower speeds. Bretazenil was also effective at decreasing motor performance at the high speed, but was not effective at lower speeds. In drug combination tests, bretazenil antagonized the effects of diazepam and clonazepam under conditions in which it was not effective when administered alone, effectively demonstrating both full agonist and antagonist effects in the same preparation. These data indicate that the sensitivity of a motor task to detect a drug's agonist effects can be manipulated by altering its relative level of difficulty, and that lower-efficacy benzodiazepines are more sensitive than higher-efficacy benzodiazepines to these manipulations.",

We apply them, therefore, to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) in carboquinones and benzodiazepines, and show their usefulness. Most QSAR analysis using neural networks has been made by adopting neural networks with supervised learning. On the contrary, SOM obeys unsupervised learning and originally does not involve the use of desired target data. If we note that an appreciable fraction of data may be missing without making the similarity comparison impossible in SOM if the number of attributes considered is appreciable, QSAR analysis using SOM is found to be possible as if supervised learning. Similar to target data in supervised learning, we can take into account target data (=observed activity) as one of attributes in addition to other attributes (=structural descriptors).

In the present study, in exploring new types of ligands for PBR, we found that a new series of compounds having a tetracyclic ring system, which were designed from FGIN-1-27, exhibited high affinities for PBR. We prepared and evaluated them for PBR affinities. The results of binding tests showed that 12e and 12f were the most potent PBR ligands among them (12e: IC(50)=0.44nM, 12f: IC(50)=0.37nM).

In the present work, we investigated the ability of the specific PBR ligands, PK 11195 or Ro5-4864, to affect mitochondrial potential and to induce apoptotic cell death in rat C6 glioma cells. Both specific ligands inhibited cell survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as assessed by MTS conversion assay, whereas the non-site selective ligand Diazepam or the low-affinity benzodiazepine Clonazepam showed no significant effects. After cell exposure to PK 11195 or Ro5-4864 we evidenced typical alterations of apoptotic cell death such as DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation assessed by flow cytometric and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, respectively. Activation of the \"effector\" caspase-3 confirmed the ability of specific PBR ligands to induce apoptosis. Moreover, PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 induced a decrease of DeltaPsi(m), as evidenced by JC-1 flow cytometry analysis. Our data demonstrate the pro-apoptotic effects of specific PBR ligands on rat C6 glioma cells.", 
    "39": "Over the last 20 years, the role of adjuvant pharmacotherapy in optimising outcome in rehabilitation programmes for alcohol-dependent patients has become increasingly evident. New avenues for rational drug treatment have arisen from better understanding of the neurobiological substrates of alcohol dependence, including adaptive changes in amino acid neurotransmitter systems, stimulation of dopamine and opioid peptide systems, and, possibly, changes in serotonergic activity. Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. However, there is still no unequivocal evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials that disulfiram improves abstinence rates over the long term. Aversive therapy with disulfiram is not without risk for certain patients, and should be closely supervised. Both naltrexone and acamprosate improve outcome in rehabilitation of alcohol-dependent patients, but seem to act on different aspects of drinking pathology. Naltrexone is thought to decrease relapse to heavy drinking by attenuating the rewarding effects of alcohol. However, data from the naltrexone clinical trial programme are somewhat inconsistent, with several large studies being negative. Acamprosate is believed to maintain abstinence by blocking the negative craving that alcohol-dependent patients experience in the absence of alcohol. The clinical development programme has involved a large number of patients and studies, of which the vast majority have shown a beneficial effect of acamprosate on increasing abstinence rates. Both drugs are generally well tolerated; nausea is reported by around 10% of patients treated with naltrexone, while the most frequent adverse effect reported with acamprosate is diarrhoea. Another opioid receptor antagonist, nalmefene, has shown promising activity in pilot studies, and may have a similar profile to naltrexone. Data from studies of SSRIs in alcohol dependence are somewhat heterogeneous, but it appears that these drugs may indirectly improve outcome by treating underlying depression rather than affecting drinking behaviour per se. Similarly, the anxiolytic buspirone may act by ameliorating underlying psychiatric pathology. Dopaminergic neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and antimanic drugs have not yet demonstrated evidence of activity in large controlled clinical trials. Trials with drugs acting at serotonin receptors have yielded disappointing results, with the possible exception of ondansetron. Because the biological basis of alcohol dependence appears to be multifactorial, the future of management of alcoholism may be combination therapy, using drugs acting on different neuronal pathways, such as acamprosate and naltrexone. Pharmacotherapy should be used in association with appropriate psychosocial support and specific treatment provided for any underlying psychiatric comorbidities.",

The experimental group relative to the control group showed significant improvement in five items such as immediate and delayed recall of verbal memory, verbal fluency, visual memory and total error of executive function.

Forster) on emotional reactivity and cognitive performance were investigated in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial involving healthy volunteers. Subjects' reports of mood change were assessed with the state-trait-cheerfulness-inventory, which measures the three concepts of cheerfulness, seriousness and bad mood as both traits and states. Cognitive performance was examined with the Sperling partial report and the Sternberg item recognition task, which were used as an index for visual attention and short-term memory processing. The intake of a single dose of Kava extract (300 mg; p.o.) led to an increase in state cheerfulness, while the phytopharmacon did not influence state seriousness and bad mood. The mood-elevating effects of Kava were most prominent in trait cheerful subjects, indicating that trait cheerfulness moderated the drug-induced increase in cheerful mood. Furthermore, Kava improved the accuracy and the speed of performing the partial report and the item recognition task, indicative of a beneficial effect of the phytopharmacon on visual attention and short-term memory retrieval, respectively. Thus, unlike conventional benzodiazepine-type anxiolytics, which tend to impair cognitive performance and to increase the occurrence of negative affective states, Kava is a potent anxiolytic agent, which, additionally, can facilitate cognitive functioning and can increase positive affectivity related to exhilaration.", 
    "43": "Over the past century, a worldwide system for the control of drugs with abuse potential has developed through the adoption of a series of international treaties. The important multilateral conventions currently in force are the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (Single Convention), the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 (Psychotropic Convention) and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988. From the beginning, the aim of these drug control treaties has been to control the abuse and trafficking of substances with abuse potential while assuring that the availability of these drugs for medical and scientific purposes is not unduly restricted. There is activity in the World Health Organization and the International Narcotics Control Board to determine whether the international control of buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist used as an analgesic and for the treatment of opioid addiction, should be changed from the Psychotropic Convention to the Single Convention. This change would result in the classification and regulation of buprenorphine as a narcotic drug rather than a psychotropic substance. Such a move is unwarranted medically and scientifically and would provoke increased controls on buprenorphine that would fundamentally disrupt the medical practice of pain management and opioid replacement therapy around the world. The negative impact of inappropriate regulatory controls when licensed medicines come under such scrutiny are described.", 
    "44": "The silicon linker is the foremost traceless linker used in solid-phase reactions. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) or trifluoroacetic aicd (TFA) can remove the silicon linker with the silicon atom being replaced by a hydrogen atom. In this experiment, the linkers 1c and 2d, which are the most useful in solid-phase reactions, were synthesized. Linker 1c is composed of seven linearly linked carbons and linker 2d includes an oxygen atom in the linear carbon chain to increase the solvation capacity. The carboxylic acid component of linker 1c and 2d forms an amide or ester bond with resin. The synthesized linkers 1c and 2d could be utilized in constructing a chemical compound library that includes indole, benzodiazepine and phenothiazine (aromatic ring compounds).",

    "46": "We performed a prospective, randomized trial in a pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care center. Infants and children requiring mechanical ventilation underwent a continuous infusion of either midazolam (starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg/h) or dexmedetomidine (starting dose of either 0.25 or 0.5 microg/kg/h) with intermittent morphine, as needed. The efficacy of sedation was assessed using the Ramsay sedation scale, pediatric intensive care unit sedation score, and the tracheal suctioning score as well as bispectral monitoring.", 
    "47": "There were 10 patients in each group. Sedation as assessed by the clinical sedation scores and the bispectral index was equivalent in the 3 groups. There were 36 morphine boluses administered to the midazolam group versus 29 and 20 morphine boluses administered respectively to the 0.25 and 0.5 microg/kg/h dexmedetomidine groups (P = 0.02 for midazolam versus 0.5 microg/kg/h dexmedetomidine). Total morphine use (mg/kg/24 h) was 0.74 +/- 0.5, 0.55 +/- 0.38, and 0.28 +/- 0.12 in the midazolam and the two dexmedetomidine groups respectively (P = not significant for midazolam versus 0.25 dexmedetomidine, P = 0.01 for midazolam versus 0.5 dexmedetomidine). In the two dexmedetomidine groups, 5 of 6 patients who at some point had a Ramsay score of 1 were less than 12 months of age while only 1 was more than 12 months of age (P < 0.05).", 
    "48": "At a dose of 0.25 microg/kg/h, dexmedetomidine was approximately equivalent to midazolam at 0.22 mg/kg/h. At 0.5 microg/kg/h, dexmedetomidine provided more effective sedation as demonstrated by the need for fewer bolus doses of morphine, a decrease in the 24-hour requirements for supplemental morphine, as well as a decrease in the total number of assessment points with a Ramsay score of 1 (inadequate sedation) and the number of patients who had a Ramsay score of 1.", 
    "49": "Drug-induced stuttering has been described in association with several drugs, in particular antidepressants and low-potency neuroleptics. Here we describe a case series of stuttering induced by the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine. Patients receiving neuroleptic treatment were carefully screened for stuttering as a possible side effect. We have studied all patients in the outpatient department (800 per year) as well as most inpatients (1300 per year) within 3 years. Seven cases of drug-induced stuttering were observed. Six patients suffered from stuttering in association with olanzapine treatment, and one received clozapine. Stuttering arose on average 2-21 days after initiation of treatment and ceased 2-5 days after discontinuation. Most patients suffered from additional diseases, such as brain pathology due to cortical atrophy or celiac disease, or received concomitant medication (i.e. intrathecal morphine pump). Our case series suggests that the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine can induce stuttering in the absence of a history of stuttering without accompanying akathisia or general decline of function. It appears that preexisting brain pathology or concomitant anti-depressant medication might predispose some patients to this side effect.",

    "51": "Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to the potential diabetogenic effect of novel antipsychotics. Until now, large prospective studies examining the relationship between atypical antipsychotics and impaired glucose metabolism have been lacking. However, the case reports and retrospective studies that we review here suggest an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics compared to schizophrenic patients treated with conventional antipsychotics or those without treatment. Although most atypical antipsychotic agents might have a diabetogenic potential, the risk of developing DM might be higher in patients treated with either clozapine or olanzapine than with risperidone, whereas data on quetiapine and ziprasidone is presently limited and needs further attention. Possible mechanisms include the induction of peripheral insulin resistance and the direct influence on pancreatic beta-cell function by 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor antagonism, by inhibitory effects via alpha 2-adrenergic receptors or by toxic effects. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotics might not be an independent risk factor for the development of DM, but hasten the onset of DM in patients bearing other risk factors. It is suggested that schizophrenic patients should be monitored for the occurrence of glucose metabolism abnormalities before starting atypical antipsychotics, and at a 3-month interval at least during therapy.",

    "56": "The effects of anticholinergic drugs selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes on prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response were determined in mice. The prepulse inhibition is associated with sensorimotor information processing in the brain. The anticholinergic agent scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly attenuated prepulse inhibition, while the drug (1-10 mg/kg, s.c.) had no effects on startle amplitude as an indicator of startle response. The muscarinic M(1) receptor antagonist pirenzepine (0.1-10 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) and the muscarinic M(2) receptor antagonist AF-DX116 (11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one) (0.1-10 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) had no effects on prepulse inhibition or startle amplitude. The muscarinic M(3) receptor antagonist 4-DAMP (1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxy-piperidinium iodide) (30 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) and the muscarinic M(4) receptor antagonist tropicamide (0.1 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly attenuated prepulse inhibition, while tropicamide (0.01 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) but not 4-DAMP (10 and 30 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) produced a significant increase in startle amplitude. These results suggest that the blockade of muscarinic M(3) and M(4) receptors leads to the disruption of prepulse inhibition.", 
    "57": "The prevalence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the setting of Barrett's metaplasia continues to increase in Western nations at a rate greater than any other cancer. The trophic properties of gastrin have been documented in gastric, pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role for this regulatory peptide in the growth of these malignancies. The aims of these studies were to identify and characterize the presence of functional cholecystokinin type-2 (gastrin) receptors on the membranes of human esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated the presence of cholecystokinin type-2 receptor transcripts in human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Competitive binding assays revealed specific binding of gastrin in SEG-1 cells (IC50 of 2.4 x 10(-8) M). This finding was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy through internalization of rhodamine green labeled gastrin heptapeptide in SEG-1 cells. Gastrin caused a dose-dependent increase in proliferation of SEG-1 cells when compared to controls. This effect was abolished by co-incubation with L365,260, a CCK-2-specific receptor antagonist. Gastrin-induced phosphorylation of the p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. In conclusion, the studied human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines possess cholecystokinin type-2 (gastrin) receptors. Receptors bind gastrin, resulting in increased proliferation in SEG-1 cells.",

    "60": "Feature selection is one of the most commonly used and reliable methods for deriving predictive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Many feature selection algorithms are stochastic in nature and often produce different solutions depending on the initialization conditions. Because some features may be highly correlated, models that are based on different sets of descriptors may capture essentially the same information, however, such models are difficult to recognize. Here, we introduce a measure of similarity between QSAR models that captures the correlation between the underlying features. This measure can be used in conjunction with stochastic proximity embedding (SPE) or multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to create a meaningful visual representation of structure-activity model space and aid in the post-processing and analysis of results of feature selection calculations.",

However, data published on this topic are rare, consisting mostly of case reports or reports in a small number of patients. The present investigation analyzes inquiries made to a regional poisons unit involving overdoses with insulin.", 
    "62": "A total of 175,890 inquiries for the years 1995-2003 (until September) were evaluated. 160 inquiries were received by telephone concerning insulin overdoses, and a standardized questionnaire was sent to the physicians asking for follow-up information. The cases were analyzed in regard to etiology, type of insulin used, concomitant substances being taken by the patient, symptoms and clinical outcome.", 
    "63": "Of the 160 inquiries investigated, 53.1% of the patients were female, 43.1% male and in 3.8% the sex of the patient was unknown. The average age was 44.7 years. 89.4% involved suicidal or parasuicidal cases, 5.0% were accidental overdoses and 1.9% involved cases of criminal overdose (3.7% were for other reasons). Rapidly acting insulins (57.8%) were used more commonly than long-acting formulations (42.8%). Benzodiazepines were the most frequently ingested concomitant medication (37.5%) with ethanol 15.6%, antihypertensive drugs 12.5% and antidepressants 10.0%. Most patients presented with a delay of 2-3 hours after insulin administration (15.0%). Almost 50% of the patients presented within the first 6 hours.

    "65": "Efflux pump like P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is known to be a major barrier to drug delivery. Functional P-glycoprotein has been recently identified in cornea and corneal cell lines. Thus, it is probable that P-glycoprotein may restrict in vivo ocular drug absorption, resulting in low ocular bioavailability. Experiments were designed using New Zealand albino (New Zealand White) rabbits to assess inhibitors of P-gp efflux to increase drug absorption. Anesthetized rabbits were given constant topical infusions of [(14)C]erythromycin in the presence and absence of inhibitors. Testosterone, verapamil, quinidine, and cyclosporine A were selected as P-gp inhibitors. Transport experiments were conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with the human mdr1 gene (MDCK-MDR1). Erythromycin exhibited significant efflux out of MDCK-MDR1 cells, suggesting that erythromycin is a good substrate for P-gp. Ocular pharmacokinetic studies were conducted using a topical single-dose infusion method. Maximum inhibition of P-gp mediated efflux was observed with 500 microM testosterone. Area under the curve (AUC)(0- infinity ) of erythromycin with 500 microM testosterone was almost 4 times higher than AUC(0- infinity ) without any inhibitor. Rate of elimination (k(10)) for erythromycin and those with inhibitors was found to be similar (141 +/- 23 min), suggesting that elimination pathways were not altered. All the inhibitors were found to be nontoxic. Verapamil also inhibited the efflux pump with moderate change in AUC(0- infinity ) and C(max) compared with control. Thus, P-gp is found to be active in vivo, and it restricts topical erythromycin absorption across the cornea, which can be inhibited by known P-gp inhibitors. Therefore, ocular bioavailability of P-gp substrates can be significantly enhanced by proper selection of P-gp inhibitors.", 
    "66": "The effects of four anesthetics on various plasma biochemical parameters were investigated in the New Zealand White rabbit. Fifty animals were assigned to five treatment groups (n = 10 per group): control (1 ml normal saline intravenously [i.v.]); ketamine (10 mg/kg i.v.) with either xylazine (3 mg/kg i.v.) or diazepam (2 mg/kg i.v.); pentobarbitone (30 mg/kg i.v.); and thiopentone (20 mg/kg i.v.). Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and phosphorus concentrations were measured by an autoanalyzer. Blood samples were obtained at six time-points: before injection and at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min and 24 h after injection of the anesthetic or saline. Plasma biochemical levels were compared to control group and baseline (time 0) levels. Plasma cholesterol concentrations significantly increased in the ketamine-diazepam (P<0.01) and pentobarbitone (P<0.05) groups, whereas plasma triglycerides significantly increased in the ketamine-xylazine (P<0.01) and ketamine-diazepam (P<0.01) groups. Plasma LDH significantly increased in the ketamine-diazepam group (P<0.001) and decreased in the pentobarbitone group (P<0.01). Plasma sodium levels significantly increased after ketamine-xylazine (P<0.05), ketamine-diazepam (P<0.05), and thiopentone (P<0.05) administration; plasma potassium significantly increased after ketamine-xylazine (P<0.05) and decreased in the pentobarbitone group (P<0.05); plasma chloride (P<0.01) and phosphorus (P<0.05) significantly increased after ketamine-diazepam treatment whereas plasma calcium levels increased (P<0.05) after ketamine-xylazine injection. From the results observed so far, we concluded that plasma levels of some biochemical parameters significantly increased or decreased after anesthetic administration. Therefore, caution is required in interpreting data on plasma biochemical parameters from anesthetized rabbits, particularly during the recovery period.",

However, its use generally has been limited to anesthesiologists because of the risks associated with deep sedation.", 
    "68": "One hundred patients undergoing colonoscopy or EGD were sedated with low-dose propofol, midazolam, and fentanyl (or meperidine). Depth of sedation was assessed at 2-minute intervals by an independent observer by using the American Society of Anesthesiologists criteria. Recovery time was determined by using paired neuropsychometric tests. A post-procedure satisfaction survey and 24-hour follow-up questionnaires were administered.", 
    "69": "For colonoscopy and EGD, respectively, the mean propofol dose was 98 mg and 79 mg, the mean midazolam dose was 0.9 mg and 0.8 mg, the mean fentanyl dose was 69 mcg and 63 mcg, and the mean meperidine dose was 42 mg (for both procedures). There were 628 assessments of the level of sedation performed during 74 colonoscopies and 101 assessments during 26 EGDs. The level of sedation was minimal in 77%, moderate in 21%, and deep in 2% of assessments. Nine of the 13 episodes of deep sedation were recorded during colonoscopy and 4 during EGD. In no instance was more than a single assessment of deep sedation recorded during one procedure. Ninety-eight percent of patients were satisfied with the sedation, and 71% returned to their usual activities within 2 hours of discharge. There was no serious adverse event.",

    "71": "BMS-214662 and BMS-225975 are tetrahydrobenzodiazepine-based farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) that have nearly identical structures and very similar pharmacological profiles associated with farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibition. Despite their similar activity against FT in vitro and in cells, these compounds differ dramatically in their apoptotic potency and tumor-regressing activity in vivo. BMS-214662 is the most potent apoptotic FTI known and exhibits curative responses in mice bearing a variety of staged human tumor xenografts such as HCT-116 human colon tumor. By contrast, BMS-225975 does not cause tumor regression and at best causes partial tumor growth inhibition in staged HCT-116 human colon tumor xenografts. Lack of tumor regression activity in BMS-225975 was attributable to its relatively weak apoptotic potency, not to poor cell permeability or pharmacokinetics. Both compounds were equally effective in inhibiting Ras processing and causing accumulation of a variety of nonfarnesylated substrates of FT in HCT-116 cells. Because BMS-225975 has poor apoptotic activity compared with BMS-214662 but inhibits FT to the same extent as BMS-214662, it is very unlikely that FT inhibition alone can account for the apoptotic potency of BMS-214662. Clearly distinct patterns of sensitivities in a cell line panel were obtained for the apoptotic FTI BMS-214662 and the cytostatic FTI BMS-225975. Activation of the c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase pathway was readily observed with BMS-214662 but not with BMS-225975. We developed a highly sensitive San-1 murine xenograft tumor model that is particularly useful for evaluating the in vivo activity of cytostatic FTIs such as BMS-225975.", 
    "72": "Conducting toxicology on post-mortem specimens provides a number of very significant challenges to the scientist. The range of additional specimens include tissues such as decomposing blood and other tissues, hair, muscle, fat, lung, and even larvae feeding on the host require special techniques to isolate a foreign substance and allow detection without interference from the matrix. A number of drugs of abuse are unstable in the post-mortem environment that requires careful consideration when trying to interpret their significance. Heroin, morphine glucuronides, cocaine and the benzodiazepines are particularly prone to degradation. Moreover, redistributive process can significantly alter the concentration of drugs, particularly those with a higher tissue concentration than the surrounding blood. The designer amphetamines, methadone and other potent opioids will increase their concentration in blood post-mortem. These processes together with the development of tolerance means that no concentration of a drug of abuse can be interpreted in isolation without a thorough examination of the relevant circumstances and after the conduct of a post-mortem to eliminate or corroborate relevant factors that could impact on the drug concentration and the possible effect of a substance on the body. This article reviews particular toxicological issues associated with the more common drugs of abuse such as the amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opioids and the benzodiazepines.",

The dried extracts were derivatized by two-step silylation and analyzed by the combination of two different gas chromatographic (GC) separations with both electron capture detection (ECD) and mass spectrometry (MS) operating in a selected ion-monitoring (SIM) mode. Quantitative or semiquantitative results were obtained for each substance based on four-point calibration. In the validation tests, accuracy, reproducibility, linearity, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ), selectivity, as well as extraction efficiency and stability of standard stock solutions were tested, and derivatization was optimized in detail. Intra- and inter-day precisions were within 2.5-21.8 and 6.0-22.5%, and square of correlation coefficients of linearity ranged from 0.9896 to 0.9999.

This proportion is 83.5% for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 46.3% for ACE inhibitors, 13.4% for benzodiazepines and 84.8% for oral contraceptives. A higher requirement prescription was found to be associated with the antecedent of a speciality training of the pharmacist (p = 0.028) and his or her age (p < 0.001). A low prescription requirement is associated with the condition of being owner of the pharmacy (p = 0.032), with a high economic level of the population attended (p = 0.016) and with the size of the pharmacy (p = 0.045).",

A special section has been dedicated to hybrid molecules resulted by the combination of two minor groove binders, especially for derivatives of naturally occurring antitumor agents, such as anthramycin or the alkylating unit of the antibiotic CC-1065, and distamycin frames.", 
    "89": "The search for new cancer therapeutics has identified protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) as a promising drug target. This enzyme attaches isoprenoid lipids to signal transduction proteins involved in growth and differentiation. The two FTase inhibitors (FTIs), R115777 (tipifarnib/Zarnestra) and BMS-214662, have undergone evaluation as cancer therapeutics in phase I and II clinical trials. R115777 has been evaluated in phase III clinical trials and shows indications for the treatment of blood and breast malignancies. Here we present crystal structures of R115777 and BMS-214662 complexed with mammalian FTase. These structures illustrate the molecular mechanism of inhibition and selectivity toward FTase over the related enzyme, protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I). These results, combined with previous biochemical and structural analyses, identify features of FTase that could be exploited to modulate inhibitor potency and specificity and should aid in the continued development of FTIs as therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and parasitic infections.", 
    "90": "Ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABA neurons are critical substrates modulating the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system implicated in natural and drug reward. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ethanol on glutamatergic and GABAergic modulation of VTA GABA neuron electrical synaptic transmission. We evaluated the effects of systemic ethanol (0.05-2.0 g/kg i.p.), the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801; 0.05-0.2 mg/kg i.v.), the connexin-36 gap junction blocker quinidine (5-20 mg/kg i.v.), the fast-acting barbiturate methohexital (Brevital; 5-10 mg/kg i.v.), and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (Librium; 5-10 mg/kg i.v.), as well as in situ VTA administration of NMDA and the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, on VTA GABA neuron spontaneous activity and internal capsule stimulus-induced poststimulus spike discharges (ICPSDs). Systemic ethanol, quinidine, and dizocilpine reduced, whereas local NMDA enhanced, and the systemic and local GABA(A) receptor modulators did not significantly alter VTA GABA neuron ICPSDs. Ethanol potentiated dizocilpine inhibition of VTA GABA neuron ICPSDs, but not quinidine inhibition. In situ microelectrophoretic application of dopamine markedly enhanced VTA GABA neuron firing rate (131%), spike duration (124%), and spike coupling, which were blocked by systemic quinidine. These findings indicate that VTA GABA neurons are coupled electrically via gap junctions and that the inhibitory effect of ethanol on electrical transmission is primarily via inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated excitation, not via enhancement of GABA receptor-mediated inhibition. Thus, the rewarding properties of ethanol may result from inhibitory effects on excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission between electrically coupled networks of midbrain GABA neurons.",

    "93": "Subjects treated with typical antipsychotics (N=1,015) were compared with those given risperidone (N=6,964) and olanzapine (N=3,421). Model-based estimates adjusted for covariates hypothesized to be associated with stroke risk revealed relative risk estimates of 1.1 (95% CI=0.5-2.3) for olanzapine and 1.4 (95% CI=0.7-2.8) for risperidone.", 
    "94": "Olanzapine and risperidone use were not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of stroke compared with typical antipsychotic use.", 
    "95": "The effect of antipsychotic medication on neurocognitive function remains controversial, especially since most previous work has compared the effects of novel antipsychotic medications with those of high doses of conventional medications. This study compares the neurocognitive effects of olanzapine and low doses of haloperidol in patients with first-episode psychosis.", 
    "96": "Patients with a first episode of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder (N=167) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with olanzapine (mean modal dose= 9.63 mg/day) or haloperidol (mean modal dose=4.60 mg/day) for the 12-week acute phase of a 2-year study. The patients were assessed with a battery of neurocognitive tests at baseline and 12 weeks after beginning treatment.", 
    "97": "An unweighted neurocognitive composite score, composed of measures of verbal fluency, motor functions, working memory, verbal memory, and vigilance, improved significantly with both haloperidol and olanzapine treatment (effect sizes of 0.20 and 0.36, respectively, no significant difference between groups). A weighted composite score developed from a principal-component analysis of the same measures improved to a significantly greater degree with olanzapine, compared with haloperidol. Anticholinergic use, extrapyramidal symptoms, and estimated IQ had little effect on the statistical differentiation of the medications, although duration of illness had a modest effect. The correlations of cognitive improvement with changes in clinical characteristics and with side effects of treatment were significant for patients who received haloperidol but not for patients who received olanzapine.", 
    "98": "Olanzapine has a beneficial effect on neurocognitive function in patients with a first episode of psychosis. However, in a comparison of the effects of olanzapine and low doses of haloperidol, the difference in benefit is small.", 
    "99": "Febrile seizures are the most common seizure type in childhood. The prognosis is usually benign. Diagnostic evaluation focuses on excluding other causes of seizures and fever, especially central nervous system infections. For most febrile seizures, whether simple or complex, education and counseling are the primary modes of treatment. Given our current state of knowledge, a rational plan of treatment focuses on counseling and preventing prolonged febrile convulsions. An understanding of the natural history and prognosis enables physicians to reassure the families of children with febrile seizures and provide appropriate counseling and management while avoiding unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.", 
    "100": "SE is a common neurologic emergency in children. The majority of children who present in SE have no history of epilepsy. Although the clinical outcome of SE depends on the etiology of the seizure to a great extent, timely and appropriate treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. SE signifies severe central nervous system dysfunction. Initial management is directed at stabilization of vital functions and a simultaneous quick but thorough investigation for an etiology. A standardized treatment protocol is essential and reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with SE. Inadequate treatment regimens and failure to recognize adverse physiological consequences of SE, such as hypoxia, hypotension, hyperthermia, and hypoglycemia, are common treatment errors. The treatment strategy for SE should ensure adequate cardiorespiratory function, stop clinical and electrical seizure activity, prevent recurrence of seizures, and identify and, if possible, treat the etiology. Achieving these four goals will improve the outcome of SE in all children. Future drug trials may also consider concurrent treatment with AEDs, which prevent the later development of epilepsy. In addition, neuroprotectants to protect against cell injury, lowering the morbidity and mortality associated with SE, and medications or rehabilitation strategies to improve the morbidity of SE after hospital discharge should also be studied.",

    "102": "Observational cross sectional study carried out in an urban Health Care Center. A total of 434 patients older than 14 years old, who are health care consumers, were included. They were selected by systematic sampling for 6 consecutives weeks. Psychodrugs consumption and related factors were measured by a questionnaire designed for this purpose. The questionnaire was filled out by personal interview and case history revision. Existence of family dysfunction was determined by self-applied Apgar-family questionnaire.", 
    "103": "Prevalence of psychodrugs consumption was 26% (95 % CI: 22-30). A total of 53% were benzodiazepines and 27% were antidepressants (73 % are SSRI). There was family dysfunction in 20 % of consumers and 12 % of non-consumers, which is a statistically significant difference (p<0.01). By logistic regression, being between 45-64 years old (OR: 3.18), or more than 65 years old (OR: 3.29), being female (OR: 2.2), being a housewife (OR: 3.07), having psychiatric background (OR: 15.2) and having important family dysfunction in the Apgar-family questionnaire (OR: 7.19) were the variables which appeared as associated with this consumption.", 
    "104": "Consumption of psychodrugs in Primary Health Care consumers is 26 %. Being 45 years old or more, female and housewife are possible factors which predict psychodrugs consumption. Psychiatric disease antecedents and having important family dysfunction are also associated independently.

    "107": "The overall prevalence of psychotropic drugs increased from 11.1 per 1000 in 1995 to 22.9 per 1000 in 2001. This increase could almost completely be attributed to the increase in the use of psychostimulants, i.e. methylphenidate, which increased from 1.7 per 1000 children in 1995 to 10.0 per 1000 in 2001. For the other psychotropic drugs, no or only a small increase was seen. For both boys and girls, the use of psychostimulants was highest in the age group of 5-14 years.", 
    "108": "During the years 1995-2001, the consumption of psychotropic drugs by children in the Netherlands has more than doubled. This increase could largely be attributed to an increased use of the psychostimulant methylphenidate by boys of the age 5-14 years.",

Recent studies of new scoring systems to monitor sedation, new medications, and new insights into post-intensive care unit (ICU) sequelae have brought about interesting ideas for achieving an adequate level of sedation of our patients while minimizing complications.", 
    "110": "The recent literature focuses on monitoring the level of a patient's sedation with new bedside clinical scoring systems and new technology. Outcomes studies have highlighted problems with both inadequate sedation and excessive sedation in regard to patients' post-ICU psychological health. More insight into drug withdrawal and addiction as complications of ICU care were examined. A new medication for sedation in the ICU has been approved for use, but its role is not yet defined.", 
    "111": "Many patients in the ICU receive mechanical ventilation and will require sedative medications. A frequently overlooked cause of agitation in the ventilated patient is pain, and assessing the adequacy of analgesia is an important part of the continuous assessment of a patient. The goal of sedation is to provide relief while minimizing the development of drug dependency and oversedation. Careful monitoring with bedside scoring systems, the appropriate use of medications, and a strategy of daily interruption can lead to diminished time on the ventilator and in the ICU.", 
    "112": "Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication linked to the development, or exacerbation of, type 2 diabetes mellitus. This report describes 3 patients being treated with olanzapine who died suddenly and unexpectedly with hyperglycemic ketoacidosis. All had olanzapine concentrations within the therapeutic range. Vitreous glucose concentrations ranged from 640 mg/dL to 833 mg/dL, and blood acetone concentrations from 25.6 mg/dL to 57.6 mg/dL. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in blood were from 55.2 mg/dL to 110 mg/dL. Low levels of isopropanol were also detected. None had a history or family history of diabetes mellitus. Glycolated (A1C) hemoglobin in 2 cases was 14.3% and 14.7%. No predisposing factors to olanzapine-induced diabetes were identified. It is recommended that chemical testing of patients dying suddenly while being treated with antipsychotic drugs include vitreous glucose and blood acetone determinations to elucidate the cause and mechanism of death in these patients. Warnings concerning this potentially fatal complication of olanzapine therapy should be included in standard pharmaceutical and prescription references.",

A total of 18 brain-injured and stroke patients, aged 20-78 yrs, were administered lorazepam, 0.5-1.0 mg, orally at bedtime as needed for 7 days and zopiclone, 3.75-7.5 mg, orally at bedtime as needed for 7 days. Total sleep time and characteristics of sleep were measured. Effects on cognition were also measured using the Folstein Mini Mental Status Exam.",

The primary variable relapse to heavy drinking rate was evaluated by means of intention-to-treat analyses. Alcohol consumption, craving, adverse events, and changes in the biochemical markers of heavy drinking and possible toxicity were also evaluated.", 
    "119": "We did not find significant differences in the survival analysis between placebo and olanzapine-treated patients (Kaplan-Meier log rank = 0.46, df = 1, p = 0.50). Eleven (37.9%) patients treated with olanzapine relapsed compared with 9 (29%) of those receiving placebo (chi = 0.53, df = 1, p = 0.5). Although some adverse events (weight gain, increased appetite, drowsiness, constipation, and dry mouth) were found more frequently in the olanzapine group, differences did not reach statistical significance in comparison with the placebo group.", 
    "120": "Olanzapine was well tolerated, as the rate of adverse events was low, and it was safe, because it did not interfere with the normalization of biochemical markers of heavy drinking or alter liver function markers. Alcohol-dependent patients showed good adherence and compliance with the treatment protocol, but we found no differences in relapse rate or other drinking variables when comparing olanzapine with placebo-treated patients.", 
    "121": "Agonists of the allosteric benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptors bind at the interface of the alpha and gamma subunits. Here, we tested the in vivo contribution of the gamma2 subunit to the actions of zolpidem, an alpha1 subunit selective benzodiazepine agonist, by generating mice with a phenylalanine (F) to isoleucine (I) substitution at position 77 in the gamma2 subunit. The gamma2F77I mutation has no major effect on the expression of GABAA receptor subunits in the cerebellum. The potency of zolpidem, but not that of flurazepam, for the inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebellar membranes is greatly reduced in gamma2I77/I77 mice. Zolpidem (1 microM) increased both the amplitude and decay of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in Purkinje cells of control C57BL/6 (34% and 92%, respectively) and gamma2F77/F77 (20% and 84%) mice, but not in those of gamma2F77I mice. Zolpidem tartrate had no effect on exploratory activity (staircase test) or motor performance (rotarod test) in gamma2I77/I77 mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg (i.p.) that strongly sedated or impaired the control mice. Flurazepam was equally effective in enhancing mIPSCs and disrupting performance in the rotarod test in control and gamma2I77/I77 mice. These results show that the effect of zolpidem, but not flurazepam, is selectively eliminated in the brain by the gamma2F77I point mutation.", 
    "122": "Both short-term (48 h) exposure to the neuroactive steroid 3alpha,5alpha[beta]-THP and its withdrawal increase expression of the benzodiazepine (BDZ)-insensitive GABAA receptor (GABAR) alpha4 subunit in hippocampus. This increase in alpha4 subunit expression was associated with a relative insensitivity of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells to modulation of GABA-gated current by the BDZ lorazepam (LZM), assessed using whole cell patch clamp techniques. Chronic ethanol is also known to regulate expression of the alpha4 subunit. Thus, in the present study we investigated the capacity of ethanol, administered in low doses across a 2 h period (0.5 g/kg, i.p., 3x), to suppress alpha4 expression produced by 48 h exposure to 3alpha,5 beta-THP in adult female rats. We show here that 2 h ethanol administration reverses the increase in alpha4 expression normally observed following 48 h steroid treatment. This effect was correlated with a recovery of responses recorded from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells to the GABA-modulatory effects of LZM. Similar effects of ethanol in suppressing alpha4 expression and restoring LZM responsiveness were seen following steroid withdrawal when alpha4 expression is normally increased. These results suggest that increases in expression of the alpha4 subunit produced by steroid exposure or withdrawal are altered by other GABA-modulatory drugs, such as ethanol.", 
    "123": "Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (Mount and Reback syndrome) is characterized by episodes of dystonia and chorea, which are precipitated by fatigue, emotional stress, alcohol, or foods. We report two children from a large kindred with this condition who responded to sublingual lorazepam.", 
    "124": "Insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common in cancer patients. Insomnia is a multifactorial health concern that currently affects at least 1 in 3 cancer patients, and yet most insomnia sufferers do not consult their physician regarding pharmaceutical options for relief. Use of hypnotic drugs (primarily benzodiazepines) is associated with increasing tolerance, dependence, and adverse effects on the central nervous system. While hypnotic drug use declined substantially in the past decade, the use of herbal sedatives appeared to increase. Mostly self-prescribed by lay people, herbal sedatives hold widespread appeal, presumably because of their lower cost and higher margin of safety when compared to pharmaceuticals. Studies of better-known herbal sedatives, notably valerian and kava, showed moderate evidence for both safety and efficacy for valerian while revealing disturbing toxicity concerns for kava. Milder sedatives or anxiolytics in need of clinical study include German chamomile, lavender, hops, lemon balm, and passionflower; St. John's wort may have anxiolytic effects with relevance to sleep. Herb-drug interactions are a possibility for some of these species, including St. John's wort. Although sufficient evidence exists to recommend some of these agents for short-term relief of mild insomnia, long-term trials and observational studies are needed to establish the safety of prolonged use as well as overall efficacy in the context of cancer treatment and management.", 
    "125": "Clonazepam, which is a benzodiazepine structurally related to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, diazepam and nitrazepam, has been available for the treatment of seizure disorders in the USA since 1976 and in Japan since 1981. Increasingly, clonazepam has been used in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. The effect of clonazepam on depression was first reported by Jones and Chouinard in 1985. Since their report, many investigators have reported on the antidepressive properties of clonazepam. A daily dose of at least 3.0 mg clonazepam in augmentation of ongoing antidepressant treatment should be considered in depression. Regarding clonazepam augmentation therapy, if a patient does not show improvement by the end of four weeks, the treatment regimen should be altered. Age at onset of the first depressive episode and a history of family psychiatric illness should be considered the predictor of prognosis. The author discusses specific guidelines for the use of clonazepam in depression.", 
    "126": "The purpose of the present study was to develop a new clinical evaluation form to compare the clinical characteristics of nicotine dependence with those associated with other drugs of abuse, using a two-compartment model consisting of \"drug dependence\" and \"dependence syndrome\". The evaluation form consisted of five scoring items: subjective effects, drug liking, withdrawal syndrome, acute psychic and acute physical disorders, and social disturbance. \"Drug dependence\" was defined by positive scores on the \"drug liking\" item. \"Dependence syndrome\" was defined by positive scores on drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome, and acute psychic and physical disorders) and social disturbance. The subjects were dependent on nicotine (cigarette smoking) (n = 114), alcohol (n = 101), methamphetamine (n = 90), inhalants (n = 63), and benzodiazepines (n = 39). All subjects met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for drug dependence. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. The other four drugs produced more intensive degrees of withdrawal syndrome and acute psychic and physical symptoms, with more significant social disturbance than nicotine. The present study indicated that nicotine dependence differed from other forms of drug dependence in that nicotine was not associated with \"dependence syndrome\".", 
    "127": "We present a series of 29 necropsies in which organic compounds (including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, antidepressants, phenothiazine, opiates, cannabinoids, meprobamate, digoxin and nefopam) were detected in arthropod larvae sampled on human corpses. No correlation was observed between drug concentrations in the larvae versus human samples. When tested, inter-larvae and inter-site variations of drug concentrations (i.e., within larvae when analyzed separately, and within anatomic sites when larvae were grouped according to their site of sampling) were enormous and not reproducible from one case to another, confirming that arthropod larvae are unreliable for quantitative toxicological analysis. Since drugs identified in maggots are always detectable in the cadaver too, we conclude that larvae analysis is of almost no interest for practical forensic casework.", 
    "128": "A screening method is described for determining whether a drug or small solute has significant interactions at the two major binding sites on human serum albumin (HSA). This method uses affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) to perform a mobility shift assay, where the solute of interest is injected in both the presence of pH 7.4, 0.067 M phosphate buffer, and the same buffer containing a known concentration of HSA. Dextran is also used in the running buffer to adjust the mobility of HSA. Two types of modified HSA are used in this assay. The first is modified with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (HNB), which selectively blocks HSA's warfarin-azapropazone site. The second type of HSA is modified with tetranitromethane (TNM), which decreases binding at the indole-benzodiazepine site. By comparing the mobility of a solute in the presence of these two modified forms of HSA vs normal HSA, it is possible to detect solute interactions at these binding sites. This approach is illustrated using warfarin and ibuprofen as examples of test solutes.", 
    "129": "Anxiety-like behaviors are integral features of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. In the experiments in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that anxiety can be regulated independently of other withdrawal signs and thus may be responsive to selective pharmacological agents. For 17 days, rats were fed ethanol (8-12 g/kg/day) in a liquid diet. Between 5 and 6 h after cessation of ethanol treatment, rats were tested in either the social interaction or plus-maze test of anxiety-like behavior after treatment with drugs hypothesized to have anxiolytic action. SB242084, flumazenil, and CRA1000-antagonists for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HT) 2C (5-HT(2C)), benzodiazepine, and corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 (CRF(1)) receptors, respectively-attenuated decreased social interaction without concomitant effects on activity measures. In contrast, ifenprodil, MDL 72222, and zolpidem-antagonists for N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and 5-HT(3) receptors, and agonist for benzodiazepine type 1 receptors, respectively-did not share this effect. Results for SB242084, flumazenil, and ifenprodil in the elevated plus-maze test were comparable to those in the social interaction test. These results support the suggestion that multiple neuronal systems (CRF(1), 5-HT(2C), and benzodiazepine receptors) contribute to the ethanol withdrawal sign of decreased social interaction. Furthermore, the selective effects of pharmacological agents on social interaction seem to indicate that this behavior can be dissociated from other signs. Because anxiety may be a complicating factor in alcohol withdrawal and relapse, future studies of this type are needed to provide focus for the effort to define selective and novel antianxiety agents for these disorders.", 
    "130": "Olanzapine treatment is associated with substantial weight gain. In this double-blind placebo-controlled study we evaluated whether the H2 antagonist famotidine may prevent/attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain. Fourteen first-episode DSM-IV schizophrenia patients were randomly allocated to receive either famotidine (40 mg/day, n=7) or placebo (n=7) in addition to olanzapine (10 mg/day) for 6 weeks. All patients completed the trial. Patients in both groups showed a similar increase in body weight (olanzapine/famotidine: 4.8 (3.2) kg and olanzapine/placebo: 4.9 (1.6) kg, respectively; a between-group difference of 0.14 (1.3) kg). Four of seven (57.1%) patients in the olanzapine/famotidine group and three of seven (42.9%) in the olanzapine/placebo group gained at least 7% of their initial body weight, a cut-off for clinically significant weight gain. Famotidine addition was safe and well tolerated and did not interfere with olanzapine's therapeutic effect. In conclusion, famotidine (40 mg/day for 6 weeks) is not effective in preventing/attenuating weight gain in olanzapine-treated first-episode schizophrenia patients.", 
    "131": "Interactions between dopaminergic neurotransmission and cholecystokinin (CCK) in the CNS may be important in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders and substance abuse. In this study, the effect of coadministration of the selective CCK receptor antagonists devazepide and L-365,260 (for selectively blocking CCK1 and CCK2 receptors, respectively), on the effect of amphetamine on the rat exploratory behavior, and on sensitization of locomotor response to amphetamine, were studied. Amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) increased exploratory activity in the exploration box for 5 consecutive testing days, while devazepide (10 microg/kg) blocked and L-365,260 (10 microg/kg) enhanced amphetamine-induced stimulation of activity. Devazepide coadministration prevented the development of sensitization to amphetamine, while coadministration of L-365,260 with amphetamine potentiated the locomotor effect of a challenge dose of amphetamine. These results suggest that endogenous CCK, released during exploratory activity, shapes behavioral responses to amphetamine by acting on both receptor subtypes, and modulates the development of sensitization to amphetamine.", 
    "132": "This randomised controlled trial was conducted to compare zolpidem to an equivalent dose of temazepam with respect to subjective rebound insomnia after cessation of 4 weeks of treatment in chronic insomnia (zolpidem 10 mg, n=79; temazepam 20 mg, n=84). Both agents improved total sleep time (TST) as well as sleep onset latency (SOL) significantly during the 4 treatment weeks. Prevalence rates for rebound insomnia, defined as a worsening of TST or SOL of more than 40% compared to baseline, were 27% for TST and 53% for SOL in the Zolpidem condition and 26% and 58%, respectively, in the temazepam condition. No significant differences were found between both agents with respect to rebound insomnia, nor with respect to their efficacy or safety. We conclude that in clinical practice zolpidem has no advantages over temazepam with respect to rebound insomnia.", 
    "133": "Results from the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) indicate that clozapine is more effective than olanzapine in reducing suicidal behavior in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. However, because InterSePT allowed the uncontrolled use of concomitant psychotropic medications (CPMs), it is possible that the antisuicidal effect of clozapine may have been influenced by greater use of such agents. This article describes the use patterns of CPMs during InterSePT and examines whether CPM use may have affected study outcome.", 
    "134": "In this study, 479 patients received clozapine and 477 patients received olanzapine. Concomitant psychotropic medications were grouped into 4 classes: antipsychotics, antidepressants, sedatives/anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers. The doses of each CPM were converted into dosage equivalents of standard reference drugs. An analysis of covariance was performed to compare mean daily doses of CPMs between the 2 groups over the 2-year treatment period. The duration of treatment for each patient was 2 years, with the first patient entering the study in March 1998 and the last patient completing treatment in February 2001.", 
    "135": "Approximately 90% of patients in both treatment groups received at least 1 CPM. The mean +/- SD number of CPMs per patient was 3.8 +/- 2.90 in the clozapine group and 4.2 +/- 3.16 in the olanzapine group. For each CPM class, the mean daily dose was statistically significantly lower in the clozapine group (antipsychotics, p <.001; antidepressants, p <.01; sedatives/anxiolytics, p <.001; mood stabilizers, p <.05). Analyses of CPM use by study intervals, suicide attempters versus nonattempters, study completers versus noncompleters, and geographic region resulted in similar findings.", 
    "136": "The results support the conclusion that the effects of clozapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior derive from its intrinsic pharmacology and not from the influence of concomitant psychotropic medications.", 
    "137": "Various fragments of the hexamethonio-type allosteric agent W84 were linked to the secondary amino group of the muscarinic M(2) acetylcholine receptor-preferring antagonist AF-DX 384 to increase the area of attachment with the allosteric site. Addition of only the phthalimido moiety of W84 gave an allosteric enhancer of NMS binding. Thus, a new lead structure for the development of allosteric enhancers of NMS binding has been discovered.", 
    "138": "Since the identification of the dopamine D(4) receptor subtype and speculations about its possible involvement in schizophrenia, much work has been put into development of selective D(4) ligands. These selective ligands may be effective antipsychotics without extrapyramidal side effects. This work describes the synthesis of a new series of 2,4-disubstituted morpholines and 2,4-disubstituted 1,4-oxazepanes with selectivity for the dopamine D(4) receptor. A 3D-QSAR analysis using the GRID/GOLPE methodology was performed with the purpose to get a better understanding of the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity. Inspection of the coefficient plots allowed us to identify that regions which are important for affinity are situated around the two benzene ring systems, a p-chlorobenzyl group, and the aliphatic amine belonging to the morpholine or 1,4-oxazepane system. In addition, the size of the morpholine or 1,4-oxazepane ring seems to be important for affinity.",

    "144": "Nondippers displayed poorer quality of sleep, as demonstrated objectively by actigraphic data; they obtained a higher mean score+/-standard deviation on the sleep questionnaire (4.6+/-2.9 vs 3.0+/-1.1, P=.030) and were taking more benzodiazepines (33.1% vs 10.7%, P=.035), indicating that their usual sleep quality was worse than that of dippers. Multivariate analysis showed a strong correlation between nondipper profile and quality of sleep and also with comorbidity, total number of drugs being taken, and pulse pressure.", 
    "145": "Actigraphy demonstrates impaired sleep in the nondipper elderly. Nevertheless, the nondipping pattern seems independent of the discomfort of cuff-inflation during the night and occurs in association with higher comorbidity and polypharmacy; therefore, it cannot be considered a \"bias,\" but is related to detrimental clinical conditions that should be studied in depth.", 
    "146": "Several clinical studies demonstrate that the absence of periods of sleep is closely related to occurrence of anxiety symptoms. However, the basis of these interactions is poorly understood. Studies performed with animal models of sleep deprivation and anxiety would be helpful in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying this relationship, but some animal studies have not corroborated clinical data, reporting anxiolytic effects of sleep deprivation.",

    "149": "Mice that were sleep-deprived for 72 h spent a lower percent time in the open arms of the apparatus than control animals. This sleep deprivation-induced anxiety-like behavior was unaffected by treatment with chlordiazepoxide (5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg IP), but reversed by an administration of 5 or 10 microg/kg IP clonidine.",

    "152": "The subjects were 30 male chronic schizophrenia inpatients. The assessment was done before and after the switch.", 
    "153": "After the switch, (i) scores of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total and three factors (anxiety-depression, anergia, and thought disturbance) decreased, (ii) the overall severity score of the Drug Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale tended to decrease, (iii) prolactin decreased but gonadal hormones remained unchanged, and (iv) scores on all three subscales (psychosocial, motivation/energy, and symptoms/side effects) in the Japanese version of the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (JSQLS) decreased. However, there were no significant group effects, or time-by-group interactions. In addition, score changes from baseline in psychosocial and motivation/energy subscales in the JSQLS were correlated with those in psychotic symptoms, particularly in the anxiety-depression factor. Moreover, responders had been taking lower doses of typical antipsychotic drugs, and had higher serum estradiol concentrations than non-responders before the switch.", 
    "154": "The study indicated that the switch to atypical antipsychotic drugs was effective in reducing elevated prolactin without affecting the gonadal hormones and in improving quality of life patients who had been treated with typical antipsychotic drugs.",

    "156": "Database searches of MEDLINE from 1966 and EMBASE from 1980 and searches of reference lists of retrieved articles were performed. Inclusion criteria were the documented presence of infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia. Outcome measures included complete cessation of spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, relapse rate, developmental outcome, and presence or absence of epilepsy or an epileptiform EEG. One hundred fifty-nine articles were selected for detailed review. Recommendations were based on a four-tiered classification scheme.", 
    "157": "Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is probably effective for the short-term treatment of infantile spasms, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the optimum dosage and duration of treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether oral corticosteroids are effective. Vigabatrin is possibly effective for the short-term treatment of infantile spasm and is possibly also effective for children with tuberous sclerosis. Concerns about retinal toxicity suggest that serial ophthalmologic screening is required in patients on vigabatrin; however, the data are insufficient to make recommendations regarding the frequency or type of screening. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any other treatment of infantile spasms. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that successful treatment of infantile spasms improves the long-term prognosis.",

    "159": "1. Ingestion of a poisonous mushroom Clitocybe acromelalga is known to cause severe tactile pain (allodynia) in the extremities for a month and acromelic acid (ACRO), a kainate analogue isolated from the mushroom, produces selective damage of interneurons of the rat lower spinal cord when injected either systemically or intrathecally. Since ACRO has two isomers, ACRO-A and ACRO-B, here we examined their acute and late effects on induction of allodynia. 2. Intrathecal administration of ACRO-A and ACRO-B provoked marked allodynia by the first stimulus 5 min after injection, which lasted over the 50-min experimental period. Dose-dependency of the acute effect of ACRO-A on induction of allodynia showed a bell-shaped pattern from 50 ag x kg(-1) to 0.5 pg x kg(-1) and the maximum effect was observed at 50 fg x kg(-1). On the other hand, ACRO-B induced allodynia in a dose-dependent manner from 50 pg x kg(-1) to 50 ng x kg(-1). 3. N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and Joro spider toxin, a Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor antagonist, inhibited the allodynia induced by ACRO-A, but not by ACRO-B. However, other AMPA/kainate antagonists did not affect the allodynia induced by ACRO. 4. Whereas no neuronal damage was observed in the spinal cord in ACRO-A-treated mice, induction of allodynia by ACRO-A (50 fg x kg(-1)) and ACRO-B (50 ng x kg(-1)) was selectively lost 1 week after i.t. injection of a sublethal dose of ACRO-A (50 ng x kg(-1)) or ACRO-B (250 ng x kg(-1)). Higher doses of ACRO-A, however, could evoke allodynia dose-dependently from 50 pg x kg(-1) to 500 ng x kg(-1) in the ACRO-A-treated mice. The allodynia induced by ACRO-A (500 ng x kg(-1)) was not inhibited by Joro spider toxin or NMDA receptor antagonists. These properties of the late allodynia induced by ACRO-A were quite similar to those of the acute allodynia induced by ACRO-B. 5. ACRO-A could increase [Ca(2+)](i) in the deeper laminae, rather than in the superficial laminae, of the spinal cord. This increase was not blocked by the AMPA-preferring antagonist GYKI52466 and Joro spider toxin. 6. Taken together, these results demonstrate the stereospecificity of ACRO for the induction of allodynia and suggest the presence of a receptor specific to ACRO.", 
    "160": "Our laboratory has been investigating the role for the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and benzodiazepines in the behavioral effects of cocaine for several years now. The following represents our initial investigation of the influence of benzodiazepines on methamphetamine reward using conditioned place preference. In these experiments, methamphetamine (0.5 mg/kg ip) resulted in a robust conditioned place preference that was attenuated when the rats were pretreated with oxazepam (10 mg/kg ip) on the day of preference testing. These data suggest a potential role for benzodiazepines in the behavioral effects of methamphetamine. Additional research will be necessary to determine if the nature of these effects is similar with what has been observed with cocaine.", 
    "161": "In agreement with previous work, adult rats given selective lesions to dopamine (DA)-containing neurons as neonates exhibited a greater behavioral sensitization to repeated phencyclidine (PCP) treatment in comparison to sham-lesioned controls. Acute administration of olanzapine (1-5 mg/kg ip) or clozapine (15 mg/kg ip) decreased sensitized PCP-induced activity in both lesioned and control animals. Acute haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg ip) had no impact on PCP responsiveness in lesioned animals, but significantly antagonized PCP effects in sham-lesioned controls. Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT(2A)/5-HT(2C)-receptor antagonist, significantly reduced PCP activation in both lesioned and control rats, suggesting that the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics against PCP-induced sensitized responses may be mediated by one of the 5-HT(2)-receptor subtypes. A 6-week chronic regimen of orally administered olanzapine, clozapine, or haloperidol failed to block the sensitization induced by repeated PCP exposure. However, a 10-month oral olanzapine treatment significantly blunted the behavioral sensitization to repeated PCP exposure in lesioned animals, even after withdrawal from chronic olanzapine for more than 3 weeks. A 10-month oral haloperidol treatment had no effect on the sensitization induced by repeated PCP dosing. The persistent effect of chronic olanzapine administration on PCP sensitization may be relevant to the chronic therapeutic efficacy of atypical antipsychotics treating schizophrenia-a clinical syndrome linked to enhanced sensitivity to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonists.", 
    "162": "Periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) can be seen associated to nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), although their pathophysiological meaning remains questionable. Functional neuroimaging has suggested that, in this setting, PLEDs may indeed be an ictal pattern. In this report we describe perfusional changes in a patient with AIDS, PLEDs and NCSE.", 
    "163": "A 37-year-old man with AIDS, cryptococcosis and recurrent epileptic seizures was admitted. After initial treatment, he remained comatose, and had MRI and serial EEG recordings performed. Technetium-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) SPECT scans were also obtained, before and after continuous benzodiazepine infusion.", 
    "164": "EEG disclosed PLEDs over the right fronto-polar region while MRI revealed meningeal thickening and scattered unspecific findings. SPECT revealed marked focal hyperperfusion overlapping the areas with PLEDs, both resolved after continuous midazolam infusion and clinical improvement.", 
    "165": "This report demonstrates association of PLEDs, NCSE, and focal hyperperfusion on SPECT, additionally supporting the concept of PLEDs as an ictal pattern. Considering that status epilepticus may eventually not be detected by conventional approaches alone, we advocate the use of functional neuroimaging to assess suspected patients with impaired consciousness.", 
    "166": "The dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second major type of senile, degenerative dementia, after the Alzheimer disease (AD). It is characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein in the cerebral cortex and in the nuclei of the brain stem. DLB patients frequently have complex visual hallucinations, depressive symptoms, Parkinsonian manifestations and cognitive deficits, showing important associations with the Parkinson disease and the AD. The DLB should be differentiated from atypical Parkinsonisms, but the differential diagnosis often remains difficult and unsafe. Clinical and neuropathological findings, as well as neuroimaging are valuable tools in establishing specific diagnosis of DLB. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, dopamine-agonists, benzodiazepines of short or medium half-life, and antidepressants may be useful in the treatment of DLB, depending on the dominant symptoms of the given patients."
