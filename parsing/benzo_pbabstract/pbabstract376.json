    "0": "Bipolar affective illness represents a syndrome not readily treated by single agents. Approximately 50% of patients are inadequately responsive to lithium and the majority of patients require supplemental antidepressants, antimanic, antipsychotic or hypnotic medications. These traditional adjunctive medications are associated with potential problems. Antidepressants may precipitate mania (at a rate about double that of placebo) or cause cycle acceleration. Neuroleptics may be associated with either more profound or longer depressive phases, and clearly increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia, to which bipolar patients appear particularly predisposed. Moreover, there are subgroups of patients who are known to be poorly responsive to lithium. These include patients with rapid cycling, dysphoric mania, co-morbid drug or alcohol abuse, a pattern of depression-mania-well interval (D-M-I as opposed to the M-D-I pattern), and patients without a family history of bipolar illness in first-degree relatives. There is increasing recognition that the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are effective alternatives or adjuncts to lithium in the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar illness. Ideally, one would want to assess whether patients who were unresponsive to lithium were responsive to an anticonvulsant alone prior to utilizing lithium in addition to anticonvulsant combination therapy. However, from the clinical perspective, it is often more expedient to use an anticonvulsant adjunctively to lithium to assess the efficacy of this combination and establish mood stabilization. When lithium is not discontinued, the increased morbidity during lithium withdrawal also would not occur and would not confound the evaluation of the new agent. We suggest the initial use of acute adjuncts to lithium with the anticonvulsants carbamazepine or valproate (instead of neuroleptics) so that their efficacy can be assessed in the individual's acute episode, with the likelihood of a positive response in longer-term prophylaxis. Hypnotic benzodiazepines with anticonvulsant properties, such as clonazepam or lorazepam, are often used to help to induce sleep in escalating bipolar patients, and may be useful adjuncts as well. Patients who were inadequately responsive to either carbamazepine or valproate alone may be responsive to the anticonvulsant combination. In a similar fashion, one can also utilize several mood-stabilizing drugs (lithium and an anticonvulsant such as carbamazepine or valproate) in the treatment of depressive breakthroughs, and then augment this combination (if necessary) with a catecholamine-active antidepressant such as bupropion or a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline or if necessary a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Once the patient has responded to a combination of drugs, it becomes problematic to decide whether the last agent added was the crucial ingredient in helping the patient achieve remission or that remission might have occurred with this agent alone. A conservative approach would have merit in patients who are finally stabilized on complex polypharmacy regimens only after many years of sequential trials; in this instance, the potential risk of re-exacerbating the illness with a taper of one of the drugs in the regimen. Rational polypharmacy should thus be implemented with careful delineation of the prior course of illness (typically using life chart methodology) and targeted treatment outcomes titrated against side effects, using sequential clinical trials in individual patients who have not adequately responded to monotherapy. In this fashion, it is hoped that pharmacodynamic differences among agents can be maximized and pharmacokinetic and side effects minimized.", 
    "1": "Established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) decrease membrane excitability by interacting with neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels. AEDs developed prior to 1980 appear to act on sodium channels. gamma-amino butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors (GABARs) or calcium channels. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates enhance GABAR-mediated inhibition. Phenytion, carbamazepine and possibly sodium valproate decrease high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials by enhancing sodium channel inactivation. Ethosuximide and sodium valproate reduce a low threshold (T-type) calcium channel current. The mechanisms of action of the new AEDs are not fully established. Gabapentin binds to a high affinity site on neuronal membranes in a restricted regional distribution of the central nervous system. This binding site may be related to a possible active transport process of gabapentin into neurons; however, this has not been proven and the mechanism of action of gabapentin remains uncertain. Lamotrigine decreases sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of voltage-dependent sodium actin potentials that may result in a preferential decreased release of presynaptic glutamate. Oxcarbazepine's mechanism of action is not known; however, its similarity in structure and clinical efficacy to that of carbamazepine suggests that its mechanism of action may involve inhibition of sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of voltage-dependent sodium action potentials. Vigabatrin irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase, the enzyme that degrades GABA, thereby producing greater available pools of presynaptic GABA for release in central synapses. Increased activity of GABA at postsynaptic receptors may underlie the clinical efficacy of vigabatrin. The potential mechanistic bases for rational polypharmacy are reviewed.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepines are known to cause muscle hypotonia, but their effects on respiratory muscle function, particularly on diaphragm, have not yet been studied. Our aim was to look for any effect of lorazepam on respiratory muscle function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Nine stable COPD patients (mean +/- SD forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 0.91 +/- 0.31 l) were included in the study. The following measurements were performed before and 1 hour after lorazepam administration (doses: 1.5 to 2 mg) by sublingual route: forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), minute ventilation (Ve), tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (f), inspiratory time/inspiratory plus expiratory time (Ti/Ttot)-, mean inspiratory flow (Vi), maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressures, maximal pleural pressure (Pplmax), transdiaphragmatic pressures (Pdi) and skeletal muscle strength and endurance. As expected, no change was noted in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC (Table-1). Besides stability of expiratory flows, this denotes no change in collaboration in spite of the sedative effects of lorazepam. There was a 20% decrease in Ve, due to a Vt reduction and a small increase in PaCO2. These could be explained by the central effects of benzodiazepines. Skeletal muscle strength and endurance decreased significantly (22 and 50% respectively-Table 2), in accordance with the previously reported muscular actions of this pharmacological group. Respiratory muscle function parameters, MIP, MEP, MVV and Ppl showed significant reductions (10 to 20 per cent), as was the case with diaphragmatic function measured by Pdi (Muller maneuver with abdominal protrussion and maximal open-glottis expulsive maneuver) (Table 3). This study demonstrates that a single lorazepam dose reduces strength and endurance of respiratory muscle in chronic stable COPD patients.", 
    "3": "Diazepam and Ro5-4864 effects on noradrenaline-induced rat vas deferens contractions were studied. We investigated whether central or peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors were involved, by studying the effects of the selective central or peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, flumazenil (Ro 151788) or PK 11195 respectively. Diazepam interactions with GABA, adenosine, theophylline, and hypercalcic medium (3.5 mM) were studied. Also, we investigate diazepam effect on KCl depolarized vas deferens. Results showed that diazepam (10(-4) to 1.7 x 10 (-4) M) and Ro 5-4864 (10(-5) to 5.5 x 10(-5) M) inhibited NA-induced vas deferens contractions and that neither flumazenil nor PK 11195 antagonized diazepam or Ro 5-4864 inhibitory effects respectively. GABA, adenosine and theophylline did not modify neither NA vas deferens response nor diazepam inhibitory action. Diazepam effect was significantly reduced in and 3.5 mM calcium medium and KCl vas deferens response was inhibited by diazepam 1.3 x 10(-5) and 1.3 x 10(-4) M. It is concluded that in rat vas deferens diazepam effect seems to be related with calcium mobilization.", 
    "4": "The concentration-related sensitization of guinea pig left atrium to adenosine in the presence of diazepam is well established. It was found in our experiments that the cardiodepressive action of hypoxia is significantly enhanced by diazepam in the left atrial myocardium. In atrial preparations obtained from guinea pigs treated with diazepam for 10 days, the hypoxia-induced depression of myocardial contractility was not altered. These results indicate that diazepam-treatment does not impaire the hypoxic tolerance of myocardium.", 
    "5": "A systematic determination method for 34 basic drugs in human plasma is described. Drugs were extracted from plasma at pH 10 using X-5 resin as adsorbent, then identified and quantitated by capillary GC-FID and GC-MS. The detection limits for most drugs are in the range of 0.5-2.0 micrograms.ml-1. Precision and linearity of the method are satisfactory for clinical toxicological applications.", 
    "6": "A capillary gas chromatographic method for the rapid simultaneous identification and quantitation of acidic and basic drugs in human plasma is presented. A special double column solid phase extraction device was designed, in which two X-5 resin columns can extract drugs at different pH. The detection limits for acidic and basic drugs can reach 0.5 microgram.ml-1, while the time needed is only half of that when using commercial solid phase extraction cartridges.", 
    "7": "Hole board test is a generally used method for screening the potential anxiolytic character of drugs. The test is based on the assumption, that head-dipping activity of the animals is inversely proportional to their anxiety state. We tested this assumption by measuring the head-dipping activity of animals in environments with different levels of aversive character (illumination). The anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide significantly elevated head-dipping activity in moderately aversive environment, it was not active in non-aversive environment, and it exhibited inhibitory activity in highly aversive environment. When the latency of the first head-dip was measured, we found that the proportion of animals with short latency was significantly increased in moderately and highly aversive environments. It is concluded, that the inverse relation between anxiety state and head-dipping activity is true only in a certain range of anxiety level. In more aversive situations, when the anxiety level of the animals is high, the holes nay represent a possible way to escape from the aversive environment instead of an explorable object. In this case the relation between anxiety state and head-dipping activity is directly and not inversely proportional.", 
    "8": "The article presents clinical experience of using Clofelin in 251 patients as a part of general anaesthesia, in postoperative period and in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The experiments on 14 rabbits chinchilla have been done prior to peridural use of Clofelin. The control for adequate use included estimation of hemodynamics parameters, cortizol, vasopressin and B-endorphin levels in plasma on different anaesthesia. The analgetic activity of Clofelin in postoperative period in patients with peripheral vascular disease was estimated by subjective tests using 5 steps of pain estimation scale. The clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous and peridural use of Clofelin during surgery and in postoperative period.", 
    "9": "Decision making in psychiatric diagnosis and treatment has not been evaluated systematically. The authors present a model for treatment of an acute manic episode using a decision analysis software program. Six treatment options were put into the model: lithium, valproate, carbamezepine, electroconvulsive therapy, clonazepam, and neuroleptics. Each treatment was evaluated on three factors, efficacy, tolerability, and cost, using data from the literature and pharmacy and billing information. Output from the computer program identified three top choices among the six options: valproate, carbamazepine, and lithium, with valproate emerging as the first choice using the data we inputted.", 
    "10": "We examined the prevalence and correlates of comorbid anxiety disorders in two groups of older depressed patients assessed at the University of Pittsburgh. A total of 336 older outpatients and inpatients with major depression were comprehensively evaluated with several instruments including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and either the SADS-L or the SCID for DSM-III-R. These patients presented with major depression, associated with a wide range of functional, cognitive, and medical impairment. One-third to one-half of them also presented with severe symptomatic anxiety. However, only a small proportion (less than 5%) met diagnostic criteria for lifetime or current panic, obsessive-compulsive, or phobic disorders. At baseline, lifetime comorbid anxiety disorders were associated with a higher rate of alcoholism and higher symptomatic anxiety. Lifetime comorbid anxiety disorders did not affect the rate of response of depression, but they were associated with a higher use of benzodiazepines and a 50% increase in the time outpatients needed to respond. These findings suggest that, even in psychiatric patients with major depression, the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders is lower in late life, but that it has important clinical and therapeutic implications.", 
    "11": "Using a within-subject cross-over, vehicle-controlled design, we investigated the acute effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands with different mechanisms of action on the displacement activities (scratching, self-grooming, and body shake) of seven male macaques living in social groups. Our aim was to test the discriminative validity of displacement activities as an ethopharmacological model of anxiety. Subjects were given i.m. lorazepam (0.10, 0.20, 0.25 mg/ kg) and FG 7142 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg). The frequency of displacement activities was decreased by the anxiolytic lorazepam and increased by the anxiogenic FG 7142 in a dose-dependent manner. Displacement activities were apparently more sensitive to anxiolytic treatment than other behavior patterns indicative of an anxiety state (i.e., visual scanning of the social environment and fear responses directed to dominant males). These results suggest that primate displacement activities are a valid ethopharmacological model of anxiety.", 
    "12": "Worry about the generalizability of findings derived from clinical trials is a nagging problem. Because most clinical trials use individuals recruited by advertisements rather than patients solicited from clinical practice, bias in subject recruitment is a major concern. This paper compares and contrasts the demographic characteristics, symptomatologies, functional disabilities, health beliefs, and health expectations of clinical outpatients to those of subjects recruited from the media (symptomatic volunteers) for pharmacologic trials. Clinical patients were slightly younger, better educated, wealthier, and were more likely to be married. They had more recent exposure to benzodiazepines and antidepressants and were more likely to view their current condition as amenable to psychotherapy. They were more likely to feel that their symptoms would get worse without some type of treatment and to believe that treatment would cure them. The symptomatic volunteers had more presenting symptoms than the clinical patients. The two groups had similar Sheehan Disability Scale scores. These results suggest that further study is warranted of the characteristics of clinical patients and symptomatic volunteers.", 
    "13": "Although there were no differences in response to an acute injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), there were strain differences in the development of kindled seizures to repeated injections (PTZ; 30 mg/kg 3 times weekly for 13 injections), with Wistar rats reaching stage 4 or 5 of clonic-tonic seizures, but hooded Lister rats reaching only stage 2 or 3 of convulsive waves axially through the body. The strains also reacted differently to a test dose of PTZ (20 mg/kg) one week after the end of kindling, with the Wistar strain showing stage 3 and the Lister strain stage 2 seizures. When the rats were tested 24 h after the end of the kindling injections there was an anxiolytic effect in the social interaction test, in both the low light, familiar and the low light, unfamiliar test conditions that reached significance in the Wistar strain. The Wistar kindled rats showed an anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety when they were tested 24 h after the end of kindling. The anxiolytic effects found 24 h after kindling could not be due to the seizure 24 h earlier, since no changes were found in rats tested 24 h after a single seizure from PTZ (60 mg/kg). When the rats were tested 1 week after the end of kindling there were no changes, compared with vehicle-injected controls, in either test of anxiety. There was no change in benzodiazepine binding in platelets of the kindled Lister rats but there was a significant increase in the kindled Wistar rats 1 week after the end of kindling and also 24 h after a single PTZ seizure. The pattern of increased platelet benzodiazepine binding did not correspond with the time course of rebound anxiolytic effects. However, after kindling it seems that there are long-lasting changes in benzodiazepine binding that are similar to the short-term increases that are found following a single seizure.", 
    "14": "The behavioural effects of several BZ (omega) receptor ligands were compared in mice using the light/dark choice task, an animal model of \"state\" anxiety, and the free-exploration test, which has been proposed as an experimental model of \"trait\" anxiety. The drugs used included non-selective full (alprazolam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam), partial agonists (bretazenil, imidazenil and Ro 19-8022) and BZ-1 (omega 1) selective receptor ligands (abecarnil, CL 218,872 and zolpidem). In the light/dark choice task, non-selective full agonists elicited clear anxiolytic-like effects increasing time spent in the lit box and simultaneously reducing attempts at entry into the illuminated cage followed by withdrawal responses, a measure of risk assessment. With the exception of abecarnil, both non-selective partial agonists and BZ-1 (omega 1) selective receptor ligands displayed reduced efficacy compared to the full agonists as they decreased risk assessment responses without altering time in the lit box. In addition, the weak anxiolytic-like actions displayed by selective BZ-1 (omega 1) agents were evident only at doses which reduced locomotor activity, indicating that this effect may be non-specific. In the free-exploration test, non-selective BZ (omega) receptor agonists markedly increased the percentage of time spent in the novel compartment and reduced the number of attempts to enter whereas selective BZ-1 (omega 1) receptor ligands displayed a weaker neophobia-reducing effect as they reduced risk assessment responses only. As was the case in the light/dark choice task, this latter effect was observed at locomotor depressant doses. These findings indicate that while both full and partial BZ (omega) receptor agonists are equally effective against \"trait\" anxiety, full agonists may be superior in reducing \"state\" anxiety. In addition, the lack of specific effects of selective BZ-1 (omega 1) receptor ligands in reducing both types of anxiety suggests that the BZ-1 (omega 1) receptor subtype cannot be considered as the primary target mediating the anxiolytic action of drugs interacting with the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "15": "The effects of chronic treatment with haloperidol on [3H]PK 11195 binding and labelling of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in the rat brain and peripheral tissues were investigated using an in vitro receptor binding technique. The intraperitoneal injection with haloperidol (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) for 21 days produced a significant increase in the specific [3H]PK 11195 binding only in the olfactory bulb, but not in the other brain areas or peripheral tissues, while single or subchronic (4 days or 7 days) administration with the drug (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to increase the binding in the olfactory bulb. Scatchard analysis revealed a significant increase in the maximum number of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites in the olfactory bulb after chronic treatment with haloperidol, showing no change in the affinity of the binding. These results suggest that there is an interaction between PBR and the pharmacological actions of haloperidol in the brain area, and that some compensatory mechanism may be involved in the PBR changes.", 
    "16": "Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and deoxycorticosterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice. Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). The corresponding epimers with the 3-hydroxy group in the beta-position were also effective but less potent (ED50 values, 33.8-63.5, i.p.). Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity. Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures. However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained. The steroids also caused a dose-dependent delay in NMDA (257 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality. We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced seizures and status epilepticus in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of status epilepticus in humans.", 
    "17": "The neuroprotective effect of 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466), a recently developed non-competitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)/kainate antagonist was demonstrated against quisqualate (10 or 15 microM) and AMPA (20 microM) excitotoxicity in mature (17-20 days in vitro) cultures of rat embryonic telencephalic cells. GYKI 52466 attenuated quisqualate (15 microM) or AMPA (20 microM) neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 16 microM and 10 microM, respectively.", 
    "18": "The effects of chronic aluminum (Al) administration on the deposition of the metal and on the receptor binding characteristics of the Ml muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MlAChR) were studied in selected rat brain areas. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with an AlCl3 solution of 1.0 mg/ml/100 g of body weight for 5 weeks, 5 days a week. Al accumulation was detected by solochrome azurine histochemistry in the brain, where the metal could be visualized in capillaries, endothelial cells and surrounding brain tissues. Changes in the binding properties of the MlAChR after chronic Al treatment were determined with the use of selective and nonselective muscarinic antagonists. Significantly decreased number of maximal MlAChR binding sites (Bmax) as measured by the equilibrium binding of [3H]pirenzepine, were detected in all of the brain areas examined. While the nonselective antagonist [3H] (-)QNB displayed a generally decreased Bmax, value, it reached the level of significance only in the striatum. These results provide a further indication that chronic Al treatment results in the accumulation of Al in the brain and consequently affects the cholinergic neurotransmission.", 
    "19": "We studied the sufentanil-sparing effect of diazepam for anesthesia induction and compared stress responses (hemodynamics, plasma catecholamine levels) and sufentanil and diazepam plasma levels during sufentanil anesthesia with or without diazepam. Sixteen aortocoronary bypass surgery patients were randomly assigned to receive diazepam (D) 100 micrograms/kg (Group DS) or not (Group S), then sufentanil (Sf) infused at 150 micrograms/min until unconsciousness (U). After tracheal intubation, the Sf dose for U (Sfu) was repeated, preceded in Group DS by D 150 micrograms/kg. Group DS patients require lower Sfu doses (2.01 +/- 0.23 micrograms/kg vs 4.87 +/- 0.63 micrograms/kg (P < 0.05) and plasma Sf levels (236 +/- 47 ng/100 ml vs 593 +/- 118 ng/100 ml (P < 0.01) and had similar or lower heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, and plasma norepinephrine levels than S patients. Linear regression of mean plasma norepinephrine and sufentanil levels gave correlation coefficients of -0.205 in S and -0.90 in DS (p < 0.05).",

    "21": "Loreclezole, an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic compound, potentiates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor function, by interacting with a specific allosteric modulatory site on receptor beta-subunits. A similar selectivity for GABAA receptor beta-subunits is apparent for the direct activation of receptor-operated Cl- channels, by the general anesthetics propofol and pentobarbital. The ability of loreclezole to activate GABAA receptors directly has now been compared, biochemically and electrophysiologically, with that of propofol. In well-washed rat cortical membranes (devoid of endogenous GABA), loreclezole and propofol increased t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding by up to 28% (at 5 microM) and 80% (at 10 microM), respectively. Higher concentrations (50-100 microM) of both compounds inhibited [35S]TBPS binding with great efficacy, an effect mimicked by GABA. In contrast, the benzodiazepine diazepam increased [35S]TBPS binding, but failed to inhibit this parameter, even at high concentrations. At concentrations of 50-100 microM, loreclezole induced inward Cl- currents in the absence of GABA, in Xenopus oocytes expressing human recombinant GABAA receptors, comprised of alpha 1-, beta 2- and gamma 2S-subunits. At 100 microM, the current evoked by loreclezole was 26% of that induced by 5 microM GABA. The current evoked by 100 microM propofol was 98% of that induced by 5 microM GABA. Currents induced by loreclezole, like those evoked by propofol, were potentiated by diazepam in a flumazenil-sensitive manner and blocked by either bicuculline or picrotoxin. These data suggest that loreclezole shares, with propofol, an agonistic action at GABAA receptors containing the beta 2-subunit and that the different efficacies of the two compounds in this regard, may underlie the difference in their pharmacological profiles. The failure of loreclezole to activate GABAA receptors containing the beta 1-subunit may be responsible for its lack of hypnotic effect.", 
    "22": "The activity and selectivity of the glutamate receptor antagonists belonging to the 2,3-benzodiazepine class of compounds have been examined at recombinant human non-NMDA glutamate receptors expressed in HEK293 cells and on native rat NMDA and non-NMDA receptors in vitro. The racemic 2,3-benzodiazepines GYKI52466, LY293606 (GYKI53405) and LY300168 (GYKI53655) inhibited AMPA (10 microM)-mediated responses in recombinant human GluR1 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells with approximate IC50 values of 18 microM, 24 microM and 6 microM, respectively and AMPA (10 microM) responses in recombinant human GluR4 expressing HEK293 cells with approximate IC50 values of 22 microM, 28 microM and 5 microM, respectively. GYKI 52466, LY293606 and LY300168 were non-competitive antagonists of AMPA receptor-mediated responses in acutely isolated rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons with approximate IC50 values of 10 microM, 8 microM and 1.5 microM, respectively. The activity of racemic compounds LY293606 and LY300168 was established to reside in the (-) isomer of each compound. At a concentration of 100 microM, GYKI52466, LY293606 and LY300168 produced < 30% inhibition of kainate-activated currents evoked in HEK293 cells expressing either human homomeric GluR5 or GluR6 receptors or heteromeric GluR6+KA2 kainate receptors. The activity of the 2,3-benzodiazepines at 100 microM was weak at kainate receptors, but was stereoselective. Similar levels of inhibition were observed for kainate-induced currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Intact tissue preparations were also used to examine the stereoselective actions of the 2,3-benzodiazepines. In the cortical wedge preparation, the active isomer of LY300168, LY303070, produced a non-competitive antagonism of AMPA-evoked depolarizations with smaller changes in depolarizations induced by kainate and no effect on NMDA-dependent depolarizations. LY303070 was also effective in preventing 30 microM AMPA-induced depolarizations in isolated spinal cord dorsal roots with an approximate IC50 value of 1 microM. Synaptic transmission in the hemisected spinal cord preparation was stereoselectively antagonized by the active isomers of LY300168 and LY293606. In summary, these results indicate that 2,3-benzodiazepines are potent, selective and stereospecific antagonists of the AMPA subtype of the non-NMDA glutamate receptor.", 
    "23": "The stereoselectivity and potency of 3N-substituted 2,3-benzodiazepines were examined in vivo against excitation of spinal neurones induced by electrophoretic ejection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) and kainate in anaesthetised rats. AMPA receptor antagonist activity resided in the (-) isomers, LY300164 and LY303070, which were effective given electrophoretically, intravenously (2.5-5 mg/kg) or orally (10 mg/kg). The same stereoselectivity was observed in neuroprotection studies. Thus, systemic administration of the (-) isomer, but not the (+) isomer, of these 2,3-benzodiazepines before or immediately after bilateral carotid artery occlusion in the gerbil was neuroprotective. For example, 10 mg/kg of LY300164 intraperitoneally or orally provided survival of up to 25% of hippocampal CA1 neurones.", 
    "24": "Rebound insomnia has been reported upon discontinuation of benzodiazepines. We describe the first case of a sleep polygraphically documented rebound insomnia with an unusual somatic fatigue syndrome after long-term use of clozapine in a 30-year-old schizophrenic male. The withdrawal symptoms occurred the first day after drug discontinuation and could be stopped by readministering clozapine. In our opinion, the sudden occurrence of the withdrawal symptoms cannot be explained by a dopaminergic hypersensitivity or a cholinergic rebound, but indicates an involvement of GABAergic and perhaps antiglutamatergic properties of clozapine.", 
    "25": "Digital movement analysis (DMA) is a new instrumental approach to assessing oral tardive dyskinesia (TD) by means of digital image processing of a video signal, tracking five paper dots placed around the patient's mouth. A total of 40 schizophrenic patients, 30 with and 10 without TD, were examined twice (with a 3-month interval) with this new device. The patients were further examined with two TD rating scales: the St. Hans Rating Scale for extrapyramidal syndromes (SHRS) and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). The schizophrenic patients accepted the instrumental assessment without any anxiety or resistance. The internal reliability of the apparatus was high, with correlation coefficients of 0.80-0.99. The DMA TD values correlated with the SHRS and AIMS scores with correlation coefficients of 0.48-0.73 indicating an acceptable, although not strong, concurrent validity. Fluctuations occurred from the first to the second examination independent of medication. For these fluctuations no correlation was found between DMA values and rating scores. Finally, the DMA device was able to detect perioral tremor as a sign of parkinsonism. It has been concluded that DMA is a useful supplement to classical TD rating, although further validity evaluation is warranted.", 
    "26": "All the classical transmitter ligand molecules evolved at least 1000 million years ago. With the possible exception of the Porifera and coelenterates (Cnidaria), they occur in all the remaining phyla. All transmitters have evolved the ability to activate a range of ion channels, resulting in excitation, inhibition and biphasic or multiphasic responses. All transmitters can be synthesised in all three basic types of neurones, i.e. sensory, interneurone and motoneurone. However their relative importance as sensory, interneurone or motor transmitters varies widely between the phyla. It is likely that all neurones contain more than one type of releasable molecule, often a combination of a classical transmitter and a neuroactive peptide. Second messengers, i.e. G proteins and phospholipase C systems, appeared early in evolution and occur in all phyla that have been investigated. Although the evidence is incomplete, it is likely that all the classical transmitter receptor subtypes identified in mammals, also occur throughout the phyla. The invertebrate receptors so far cloned show some interesting homologies both between those from different invertebrate phyla and with mammalian receptors. This indicates that many of the basic receptor subtypes, including benzodiazepine subunits, evolved at an early period, probably at least 800 million years ago. Overall, the evidence stresses the similarity between the major phyla rather than their differences, supporting a common origin from primitive helminth stock.", 
    "27": "Due to the age-dependent changes of pharmacodynamic and pharmcokinetic, the frequency of undesirable side-effects of benzodiazepines is higher in geriatric patients. An increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and their metabolites can induce extremely prolonged duration of action leading to unconsciousness and respiratory insufficiency. Because of an assumed postoperative \"psychosyndrome\", a 72-year-old patient was treated with high doses of diazepam combined with single doses of tramal, clonidin and ranitidin. This treatment was followed by the development of respiratory insufficiency requiring intensive care with intubation for 8 days including assisted ventilation for 2 days. The serum concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites lay within the therapeutic range until the 7th day after the end of application. Therefore, the authors conclude that when using benzodiazepines in geriatric patients, the physiological peculiarities of this age group and possible interactions with other drugs leading to an increase in potency must be carefully considered.", 
    "28": "Aminostigmin, a novel reversible inhibitor of cholinesterase developed in Russia, has been tried in management of poisoning with cholinolytyics, antihistamine drugs, tricycle antidepressants and derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepine. The treatment of 144 patients with aminostigmin and 20 patients with galantamin showed close to similar efficacy of these drugs. The scheme of aminostigmin administration is proposed warranting fast relief of cholinolytic syndrome in subjects poisoned with cholinolytics, antihistamine drugs and antidepressants. Benzodiazepines poisoning was unresponsive to aminostigmin. Rare side effects were caused by overdose. Aminostigmin is an effective antidote in cholinolytic poisoning.", 
    "29": "Spinal anaesthetics can induce histopathologic lesions and regional haemodynamic alterations in the spinal cord. There are numerous causes of neurologic lesions, including direct trauma of the spinal cord and nerve roots during puncture or catheter insertion, compromised spinal cord perfusion and direct neurotoxic effect. Histopathologic lesions are localized either in meninges (meningitis or arachnoiditis) or in neuraxis (myelitis or axonal degeneration). Neurotoxicity can result from decrease in neuronal blood supply, elicited by high concentrations of the solutions, long duration exposure to local anaesthetics, and the use of adjuvants. They have been implicated in the occurrence of cauda equina syndrome after continuous spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric solution of lidocaine and tetracaine given through small diameter catheters. Selective spinal analgesia is induced by spinal opioids without motor blockade except for meperidine. Complications occurred in patients after high doses of morphine, which were related to one of its metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide. Preservative-free opioid solutions are to be preferred for spinal anaesthesia. There is no report of neurotoxicity neither in animal studies, nor in humans, using spinal clonidine. In order to reduce the incidence of neurotoxicity, some safety rules should be followed. The lowest efficient dose of local anaesthetics must be given. Incomplete blockade should not necessarily lead to a reinjection. Large volume of hyperbaric lidocaine or repeated injections of such solutions must be avoided as well as preservative-containing solutions. The administration of new compounds by the spinal route must be supported by data of spinal neuropharmacology and the lack of neurotoxicity must have been previously checked with animal studies.", 
    "30": "The effects of an anxiolytic drug, ethyl loflazepate (CM6912) on sleep EEGs were investigated by the interval histogram method originally developed. EEGs were classified into each of the delta 2-beta 2 and sigma 1 wave-form parameters, and the individual frequencies were determined on the third baseline, second drug and the first recovery nights in each sleep stage. In comparison with the second baseline night, the sigma 1 waves in stage 2 sleep and the delta 1 waves in REM sleep were decreased and the alpha and sigma 1 waves in stage 3 sleep were increased on the third baseline night. In consideration of the 5% significance level and the remarkable influence of drug administration, described below, no major problems were encountered in the use of the night as a control in this experimental schedule. The main characteristics of administration of CM6912 manifested as decreases in the slow wave, increases in the fast wave, and an increase in the sigma 1 wave in sleep stages other than stage 1. These tendencies were remarkable on the second drug night and were still evident even on the recovery night. Increases in sigma 1 wave were related to increases in sleep spindles. The increases in the beta 2 wave were particularly remarkable in REM sleep.", 
    "31": "Multiple trauma often leads to systemic inflammatory reaction and multiple organ dysfunction. Modulation of this response may be promising. Several pharmacologic approaches, such as antioxidants (e.g. superoxidedismutase), calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem), cytokines (e.g. interferone gamma), and modulators of intracellular signal transduction pathways (e.g. pentoxiphylline) have been shown to improve outcome in experimental models and/or in clinical pilot studies. However, up to now no definitive evidence has been provided in prospective, randomized, and blinded \"intention to treat\" trials that these agents are able to reduce mortality and morbidity of the traumatized patient. Hence, supportive care of failing organs, treatment of hypoxemia and maintenance of an appropriate systemic blood pressure remain the mainstay of critical care therapy. Widely accepted therapeutic measures are (i) immediate treatment of hypoxia by administration of oxygen and ventilatory support, if needed, to maintain an oxygen tension of 60 mmHg or higher (ii) maintenance of adequate oxygen content by transfusion of red packed cells in order to restore a hematocrit of 23-30% (iii) treatment of hypovolemia by infusion of crystalloids, colloids and blood products (iv) normoventilation and restoration of a normal or elevated blood pressure in patients with severe head injury (v) immobilisation and early administration of methylprednisolone in patients with spinal cord injury (vi) analgesia by administration of opioids, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or ketamine (vii) sedation with benzodiazepines, gamma-hydroxbutyrate or propofol (viii) early enteral nutrition (ix); antibiotic therapy of infections (x) pressure controlled ventilation in patients with acute lung injury (xi) continuous veno-venous hemofiltration in patients developing acute renal failure and (xii) early surgical interventions to control bleeding and/or to evacuate intracerebral hematomas.", 
    "32": "Agitation or psychosis or both occur in half or more of patients with dementia at some point during the course of illness. The treatment of these signs and symptoms ideally entails identification and alteration of physical, environmental, social, and psychiatric factors. Environmental modification, education of caregivers, and therapeutic activity programs are nonpharmacologic approaches that can effectively reduce some signs and symptoms of this nature. For those that remain, empirical administration of pharmacologic agents may be appropriate. One approach is to inventory the specific behaviors and develop a \"therapeutic metaphor,\" i.e., subtype the agitated behaviors according to the presence of target symptoms likely to respond to specific classes of medication. Available evidence is reviewed regarding the efficacy and safety of somatic therapies for agitation, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and cholinesterase inhibitors.", 
    "33": "A baculovirus expression system was used to produce functional human recombinant GABAA receptors in Sf-9 insect cells in order to study the biochemistry, pharmacology and functional characteristics of this receptor complex. We have identified and characterized various factors which influence the level of receptor expression in multiple virus infections. We have shown that the level of expression of the GABAA receptor complex varies with the levels of expression of the individual subunits. We have also shown that the assembly process has a defined timecourse, and it is dependent upon the ratio of the number of infectious virus particles (MOI ratio) of each subunit in multi-virus infections. In multiple infections, the capacity for expression of the infected cell is shared proportionally by entering virus particles and, there is a direct correlation between the amounts of subunit mRNA and levels of subunit protein expression, and the amount of ligand binding to expressed protein. Finally, reinfection of previously infected cells does not result in subsequent protein expression. Knowledge of these various factors allows us to construct recombinant GABAA receptor complexes with reproducibility and flexibility with regard to subunit composition. By co-expression of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, both the recognition site for GABA and the allosteric (benzodiazepine) modulatory site are formed and appear to reproduce the pharmacology of endogenously expressed receptors as measured in mammalian CNS. Only a single receptor is produced irrespective of the expression levels of the subunits, showing that GABAA receptor assembly is highly regulated.", 
    "34": "Furosemide specifically reverses the inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of t-[35S]-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding and increases the basal [35S]TBPS binding to the cerebellar granule cell layer GABAA receptors. For the selectivity of furosemide, an interplay between GABAA receptor alpha 6 and beta 2 or beta 3 subunits is needed. We have now investigated the furosemide sensitivity of cerebellar [35S]TBPS binding in the alcohol-sensitive (ANT) rat line that harbors a pharmacologically critical point mutation in the alpha 6 subunit [alpha 6 (Q1000)], increasing benzodiazepine affinity of the normally insensitive alpha 6-containing receptors. ANT receptors were less efficiently affected by furosemide, while a normal GABAA receptor antagonism was observed with a specific GABAA receptor antagonist SR 95531. Reduced [3H]muscimol binding in ANT samples and small alterations in situ hybridization signals for alpha 1, alpha 6, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2 and delta subunit mRNAs failed to correlate with impaired cerebellar furosemide efficacy in individual animals. The alpha 6 (q100) ANT mutation was not responsible for the reduced efficacy of furosemide in the ANT rat line, as judged from the potent furosemide antagonism in recombinant ANT-type alpha 6 (Q100)beta 3 gamma 2 receptors. This data suggest that presence of a novel abnormality in the structure and/or expression of alpha 6 subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the ANT rat line.", 
    "35": "To date, the study of the relationship between drug occupancy and action in the brain has had to rely on the use of either animal models or of indirect kinetic measures in man, e.g. serum concentrations of unbound drug (as a measure of \"free\" drug in brain). We describe the first set of experiments which directly measure agonist-induced changes in both pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetic parameters simultaneously and which demonstrate the feasibility of these studies in man. Five healthy volunteers each had two PET scans using [11C]flumazenil (a radiolabelled benzodiazepine site antagonist) as part of a study investigating kinetic models and the relationship between occupancy and effect of benzodiazepine site ligands. In both studies the [11C]flumazenil was displaced from the brain by infusion of midazolam administered i.v. 30 min into the scan. In one study a higher dose of midazolam was administered than in the other (range 12.5-50 micrograms/kg). Time-activity curves of the concentration of radioligand were derived in 17 different brain regions using a stereotactic automatic method of region selection. We demonstrated that there are significant differences in an index of occupancy, induced by the two different doses of midazolam, both across brain regions and within subjects. There was a significant correlation between measured occupancy index change and pharmacodynamic effects as measured by the peak change in beta 1 spectral power on EEG. There was no significant correlation between dose administered and EEG changes; plasma concentrations of midazolam were correlated with the occupancy index and with the EEG measures. In addition, we have demonstrated that a non-regional total index of brain occupancy can be obtained by analysing the non-tomographic data obtained with the PET scanner (total radioactivity counts head curve) and that this index shows significant correlations both with the dose administered and with the pharmacodynamic measure. This last finding validates the use of other non-tomographic counting techniques (Malizia et al., 1995a) where an index of displacement can be obtained after the administration of less than 1% of the dose of radiation needed for a PET study. These studies are likely to be useful in human psychopharmacology, in particular in the assessment of tolerance and of putative changes in benzodiazepine sensitivity in anxiety disorders. The same principles can be applied to other ligand studies and will be useful to validate current PK/PD models.", 
    "36": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) that are endowed with full positive allosteric modulatory (FAM) activity on GABAA receptors cause anterograde amnesia in both animals and humans. In rats subjected to a delayed object recognition test, diazepam, endowed with FAM activity, exerted an amnesic action, whereas BZs endowed with partial allosteric modulatory (PAM) activity on GABAA receptors, such as imidazenil, failed to induce amnesia, even if administered at doses five times higher than those equipotent to a standard anticonvulsant dose of diazepam (17.6 mumol/kg/os). After discontinuation of 14 days' treatment with vehicle, diazepam, or imidazenil (three times daily with increasing doses starting from 17.6 mumol/kg/os for diazepam and 2.5 mumol/kg/os for imidazenil), we compared the persistence of tolerance to the amnesic effect of diazepam with the persistence of the changes in the context of four (alpha 1, alpha 5, gamma 2L, gamma 2S) GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the fronto-parietal motor (FrPaM) cortex and the hippocampus. Rats receiving the long-term treatment with diazepam developed a tolerance to the amnesic effect of this drug and showed a decrease (30-50%) in the expression of mRNAs encoding for alpha 1 gamma 2L, gamma 2S GABAA receptor subunits, an increase, by approximately 30%, of the expression of mRNA of the alpha 5 subunit in the FrPaM cortex and a decrease, by approximately 25%, in the expression of mRNA, of the alpha 1 subunit in the hippocampus. These changes of subunit mRNA expression and the tolerance to the amnesic effect of diazepam returned to control values 72 hr after termination of the long-term treatment with diazepam. No tolerance to the amnesic effect of diazepam and no changes in GABAA receptor subunit mRNA expression were found in rats undergoing long-term treatment with imidazenil.", 
    "37": "Diazepam and abecarnil produce their overt effects by interaction with the GABAA receptor. Chronic treatment with abecarnil, however, does not induce diazepam-like tolerance. This study investigates the effects of chronic diazepam and abecarnil treatment on expression of GABAA receptor alpha 1-6 beta 1-3 and gamma 1-3 subunit isoform mRNAs in rat cortex. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected subcutaneously once daily for 7 or 14 days with 15 mg/kg diazepam or 6 mg/kg abecarnil in sesame-oil vehicle, and steady-state levels of GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs were quantified by solution hybridization. The levels of alpha 4- and alpha-, beta 1- and gamma 3-subunit mRNAs were significantly increased after 7 days of diazepam treatment, and this effect was maintained at 14 days. A significant increase in alpha 3-subunit mRNA was apparent only after 14 days of diazepam treatment and a significant decrease in beta 2-subunit mRNA was seen only after 14 days of abecarnil treatment. Gamma 2-Subunit mRNA was significantly decreased after 14 days of either diazepam or abecarnil exposure. A degree of association between a particular drug treatment and changes in the levels of mRNAs arising from a given gene cluster was noted. Our results are consistent with a model of diazepam dependence based on GABAA receptor subunit isoform switching.", 
    "38": "The gamma 2 subunit is necessary for the expression of the full benzodiazepine pharmacology of GABAA receptors and is one of the major subunits in the brain. In order to determine the location of channels containing the gamma 2 subunit in relation to GABA-releasing terminals on the surface of neurons, a new polyclonal antipeptide antiserum was developed to the gamma 2 subunit and used in high resolution, postembedding, immunoelectron-microscopic procedures. Dual immunogold labelling of the same section for two subunits, and up to three sections of the same synapse reacted for different subunits, were used to characterize the subunit composition of synaptic receptors. The gamma 2 subunit was present in type 2, \"symmetrical\" synapses in each of the brain areas studied, with the exception of the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. The gamma 2 subunit was frequently co-localized in the same synaptic junction with the alpha 1 and beta 2/3 subunits. The immunolabelling of synapses was coincident with the junctional membrane specialization of the active zone. Immunolabelling for the receptor often occurred in multiple clusters in the synapses. In the hippocampus, the gamma 2 subunit was present in basket cell synapses on the somata and proximal dendrites and in axo-axonic cell synapses on the axon initial segment of pyramidal and granule cells. Some synapses on the dendrites of GABAergic interneurones were densely labelled for the gamma 2, alpha 1 and beta 2/3 subunits. In the cerebellum, the gamma 2 subunit was present in both distal and proximal Purkinje cell dendritic synapses established by stellate and basket cell, respectively. On the soma of Purkinje cells, basket cell synapses were only weakly labelled. Synapses on interneuron dendrites were more densely labelled for the gamma 2, alpha 1 and beta 2/3 subunits than synapses on Purkinje or granule cells. Although immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence methods show an abundance of the gamma 2 subunit in granule cells, the labelling of Golgi synapses was much weaker with the immunogold method than that of the other cell types. In the globus pallidus, many type 2 synapses were labelled for the gamma 2 subunit together with alpha 1 and beta 2/3 subunits. The results show that gamma 2 and beta 2/3 subunits receptor channels are highly concentrated in GABAergic synapses that also contain the alpha 1 and beta 2/3 subunits. Channels containing the gamma 2 subunit are expressed in synapses on functionally distinct domains of the same neuron receiving GABA from different presynaptic sources. There are quantitative differences in the density of GABAA receptors at synapses on different cell types in the same brain area.", 
    "39": "Native GABAA receptors containing different gamma-subunit variants were distinguished immunobiochemically with antisera selectively recognizing the gamma 1-, gamma 2- and gamma 3-subunits. While GABAA receptors containing the gamma 2-subunits were confirmed to be rather ubiquitous in the adult brain, receptors characterized by the gamma 1- or gamma 3-subunit were of low abundance, as shown by immunoprecipitation. The three receptor populations differed strikingly in their benzodiazepine (BZ) site ligand binding profiles. The gamma 3-receptor population displayed reduced affinity for the full agonists clonazepam flunitrazepam and virtually lacked sensitivity to zolpidem. The gamma 1-receptor population displayed low affinity for all benzodiazepine site ligands tested, except for flunitrazepam, and could be differentiated from the gamma 2- and gamma 3-receptors by its low affinity for the inverse agonist beta CCM and its lack of affinity for the partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 and the antagonist flumazenil. Since flumazenil antagonizes all major effects of BZ agonists, gamma 1-receptors are not involved in mediating these actions in vivo. In immunopurified receptors, the gamma-subunit variants were found to be assembled with different variants of alpha- and beta-subunits, indicating that not only the gamma 2-subunit gamma 1- and gamma 3-subunits are part of various receptor subtypes. In addition, the gamma 2- and gamma 3-subunits can be co-assembled in native receptors, consistent with the subunit stoichiometry of two alpha-, one beta- and two gamma-subunits proposed previously for recombinant receptors.", 
    "40": "Alteration of agonist affinity is a potential mechanism for pharmacological modulation of ligand-gated receptor channel function. The time course for receptor activation and current onset is determined by the combined rates for two kinetic transitions that underlie the protein confirmations for binding agonist and channel gating. Using ultrafast ligand exchange techniques, we distinguish between these previously difficult to separate events and demonstrate their independent pharmacological modulation. Diazepam, which increases apparent affinity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to GABAA receptors, was used to examine its effects on GABA binding and ion channel gating of expressed alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors from excised outside-out patches of acutely transfected HEK 293 cells. Diazepam increased rates of current onset evoked by low concentrations (< 1 mM) but not at saturating GABA concentrations. Furthermore, rates of current decay were not affected during brief applications of GABA, and thus, demonstrated a diazepam specific effect on ligand binding affinity and not channel gating kinetics. However, current decay during and following prolonged GABA applications were altered by diazepam in a fashion similar to that for higher concentrations of GABA which also increased receptor desensitization. These findings and analysis by computer modeling indicated that diazepam likely enhances GABA receptor currents primarily by accelerating GABA association to its receptor at the first agonist binding site. These results provide the first direct physiological evidence for pharmacological modulation of microscopic binding affinity of GABA receptors.", 
    "41": "We have studied the postnatal development of GABAA receptor alpha 1 and alpha 6 subunits expressed by primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells originating from 2-day-old (postnatal day 2, P2) and 10-day-old (P10) rat neonates. At these ages, the granule cells are at distinct stages of cerebellar development. In both cases, GABAA receptor alpha 1 and alpha 6 subunit-like immunoreactivities were detected, and displayed temporal expression profiles that were correlated with the maturity of the cerebella from which the cultured granule cells were derived. Using two different specificity anti-alpha 1 subunit-specific antibodies, immunoreactive species with M(r) 53,000 Da and 54,000 Da were detected by immunoblotting. The lower 53,000-Da band co-migrated with the alpha 1 subunit-like immunoreactivity detected in GABAA receptors purified from adult rat forebrain by benzodiazepine affinity chromatography. This 53,000-Da alpha 1 subunit-like immunoreactive species was detected at day 1 in vitro (1 DIV) in P10 cultures and 3-5 DIV in P2 cultures. The GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit-like immunoreactivity (58,000 Da) was not detected until 5-7 DIV in P10 and 9-11 DIV in P2-derived cultures. The appearance of alpha 6 subunit-like immunoreactivity was paralleled by an up-regulation of alpha 1 subunit expression and a concomitant increase in diazepam-insensitive (DZ-IS) [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding activity, a pharmacological characteristic of alpha 6 and alpha 1 alpha 6-subunit-containing GABAA receptors (Pollard et al. J. Biol. Chem., 270, 21,285-21,290, (1995)). Antagonism of both non-NMDA and NMDA subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors did not significantly affect the developmental profile, the level of GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit or the total DZ-IS or DZ-S [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding activities expressed by these neurons. These results provide further evidence that the expression of specific GABAA receptor subunit genes is subject to differential regulation. Furthermore, developmental expression of the GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit gene by these neurons is either a preprogrammed event or is initiated by an environmental cue that is received early in granule cell development, and it is not a result of afferent activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors.", 
    "42": "A compound (L-655,708) has been identified which has at least 50-fold selectivity for the benzodiazepine site on GABAA receptors containing an alpha 5 subunit over those containing an alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 or alpha 6 subunit in combination with beta 3 and gamma 2. The compound was radiolabelled with tritium and investigated as a novel radioligand which recognizes the benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptors which contain the alpha 5 subunit. [3H]L-655,708 labels one saturable and specific population of binding sites in rat hippocampus with a Kd of 2.4 +/- 0.7 nM and a Bmax of 256 +/- 42 fmol/mg protein. The pharmacology of the binding site labelled was consistent with that of receptors present in cells transfected with alpha 5, beta 2 and gamma 2 and with receptors immunoprecipitated from rat brain with an alpha 5-selective antiserum. It is concluded that [3H]L-655,708 is the first radioligand to date which is selective for any BZ2 subtype of the GABAA receptor and should provide a valuable tool for elucidating the structure and function of the alpha 5-containing GABAA receptor subtype.", 
    "43": "Human embryonic kidney 293 cells transiently transfected with alpha 4-, beta 3- and gamma 2-subunits of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors from the rat exhibited specific high affinity binding sites for [3H]muscimol, [3H]Ro 15-4513 and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS). Bmax values obtained, however, were dramatically different for these compounds. In addition, GABA was able to inhibit only 20% of specific [35S]TBPS binding to membranes from alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2-transfected cells. In order to investigate possible receptor heterogeneity, receptors were extracted from alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2-transfected cells and were fractionated by chromatography on an anti-gamma 2-, followed by an anti-alpha 4- and an anti-beta 3-immunoaffinity column. Western blot analysis of the column eluates indicated the separate existence of GABAA receptors consisting of alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2-, alpha 4 beta 3- or beta 3-subunits in alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2-transfected cells. This, and the finding that only alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2- but not alpha 4 beta 3- or beta 3-receptors possess high affinity binding sites for all three radiolabeled ligands investigated, combined with the observation that [35S]TBPS binding to receptors consisting of beta 3-subunits cannot be inhibited by GABA, can explain most of the binding data obtained. The present results suggest an inefficient assembly of gamma 2- with alpha 4- and/or beta 3-subunits under the conditions used, and indicate that recombinant receptors expressed in HEK cells are not necessarily homogeneous.", 
    "44": "A novel anti-alpha 4 antibody has been used for the purification and characterization of the alpha 4-containing GABAA receptors in the rat brain and for studying the immunocytochemical distribution of the alpha 4 subunit peptide in rat brain and retina. The anti-alpha 4 antibody recognized a 66 kDa peptide in brain membranes and immunoprecipitated 10-28% of the brain GABAA receptors in various brain regions as determined by [3H]muscimol binding. The highest immunoprecipitation values were obtained in the thalamus and the lowest in the cerebellum. Surprisingly, the receptors immunoprecipitated by anti-alpha 4 showed little or no diazepam-insensitive or diazepam-sensitive [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites in any brain region. In the cerebellum, where 25% of the [3H]Ro15-4513 binding is diazepam-insensitive, much of the latter was immunoprecipitated by an anti-alpha 6 antibody but not by the anti-alpha 4 antibody. Immunoblots of immunoaffinity-purified GABAA receptors from the cerebral cortex on immobilized anti-alpha 4 revealed molecular colocalization of alpha 4 and gamma 2. However, the absence of significant benzodiazepine binding in these GABAA receptors suggests that the assembly of the alpha 4 and gamma 2 subunits in the cerebral cortex and in other brain regions is such that they do not normally form diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites. This result contrasts with the presence of diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites in the GABAA receptors expressed in heterologous systems resulting from the combination of alpha 4, gamma 2 and beta 2 subunits. Immunocytochemistry has revealed the abundance of alpha 4 peptide immunoreactivity in the thalamus and dentate gyrus (mainly in the hilar neurons and the inner third of the granule cell layer). The alpha 4 immunoreactivity is also present in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb and in all layers of the neocortex and pyriform cortex. In the retina, alpha 4 is concentrated on ganglion cells (including some giant ganglion cells), the inner plexiform layer and to a lesser extent in the outer plexiform layer.", 
    "45": "Both native and recombinant \"diazepam-insensitive\" GABAA receptors (DI) are characterized by the very low affinities of prototypic 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam and the high affinity of an imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro 15-4513. The presence of either an alpha 4 or alpha 6 subunit imparts this unusual pharmacological profile to DI. Based on the affinities of these compounds at recombinant DI, the pharmacological properties of alpha 4- and alpha 6-bearing receptor isoforms appear to be very similar if not identical. Using a larger sample of structurally diverse compounds, we now demonstrate distinct but related ligand binding profiles of recombinant alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 DI. Comparison of 18 ligands drawn from three principal structural groups (beta-carbolines, imidazobenzodiazepines and pyrazoloquinolinones) revealed that the affinity of at least one representative from each group differed by > 5-fold between alpha 4- and alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors. While the high correlation (r2 = 0.926; p < 0.001) obtained between the affinities of these ligands at alpha 4- and alpha 6-containing receptors underscores the similarity between these receptor isoforms, a significant deviation of the slope of this correlation (0.792; 95% C.I. 0.673-0.911) from unity is substantive evidence that these DI possess distinct pharmacological profiles. These findings indicate that it is feasible to develop selective ligands for these DI isoforms.", 
    "46": "Loreclezole is a newly developed antiepileptic drug which has been shown to act at a specific site on beta 2 or beta 3 GABAA receptor subtypes to enhance the peak whole-cell response to submaximal concentrations of GABA. Potentiation by loreclezole occurred with high affinity only at GABAA receptors containing a beta 2 or beta 3 subtype, not a beta 1 subtype. We have studied the effect of loreclezole on whole-cell currents from recombinant GABAA receptors transiently expressed in L929 fibroblasts and on currents from cultured mouse cortical neurons and have found a second, inhibitory action of loreclezole that was independent of the beta-subunit subtype composition of the receptor. Loreclezole, at concentrations above 6 microM, enhanced the degree and rate of apparent desensitization of the whole-cell current in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was voltage-independent, non-competitive and increased with increasing GABA concentration. The increase in desensitization was not blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil and did not require the presence of a gamma subunit. Loreclezole acted at a novel inhibitory allosteric site to increase the apparent desensitization of the GABAA receptor, regardless of its subunit composition. This activity of loreclezole may have implications for its experimental or clinical use as an antiepileptic drug.", 
    "47": "We have used [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro15-4513 as photoaffinity labelling agents in combination with a chemical cleavage technique to localize the benzodiazepine recognition sites of specific human recombinant alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2 GABAA receptor subtypes. The chemical agent utilized was hydroxylamine, whose substrate is a relatively rare asparagine-glycine amide bond that occurs only in the alpha subunits of the receptors examined in this study. Cleavage products were resolved using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The results of these experiments show that, in the alpha 1 subunit-containing receptors, incorporation of [3H]flunitrazepam occurs within residues 1-103 of the alpha 1 subunit, while incorporation of [3H]Ro15-4513 occurs within the region of the alpha 1 subunit that lies between residue 104 and the C-terminus. Photolabelling of membranes prepared from the alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2-expressing cell line with [3H]Ro15-4513 resulted in the incorporation of radiolabel into two major protein species of M(r) 56,000 and M(r) 48,000, indicating incorporation into the alpha 6 subunit and possibly also the gamma 2 subunit. Hydroxylamine cleavage of alpha 6-containing receptors labelled with [3H]Ro15-4513 produced a gel profile consistent with the incorporation of the label occurring between residue 125 and the C-terminal. Thus, we have shown that the recognition sites for the agonist [3H]flunitrazepam and the inverse agonist [3H]Ro15-4513 occur within distinct domains of the human GABAA receptor.", 
    "48": "The enhancement by pregnanolone (5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one) and propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) of [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding to GABAA receptors in rat whole brain homogenate has been investigated. Two components in the concentration-effect relationship for pregnanolone were distinguished by the sensitivity of one component to antagonism by bicuculline and enhancement by muscimol, and the selective but weak antagonism of the bicuculline-insensitive component by 11-ketoprogesterone (4-pregnen-3,11,20-trione). Unlike pregnanolone, the enhancement by propofol of [3H]FNZ binding appeared to comprise a single component which was insensitive to 11-ketoprogesterone and was only slightly antagonised by bicuculline and slightly enhanced by muscimol. These results provide evidence for distinct GABA-dependent and GABA-independent components of the action of pregnanolone in the enhancement of [3H]FNZ binding, with the GABA-independent component being sensitive to 11-ketoprogesterone. The data also support the suggestion of different binding sites for pregnanolone and propofol.", 
    "49": "We have previously characterized 5-(4-piperidyl)isoxazol-3-ol (4-PIOL) as a non-desensitizing partial agonist at GABAA receptors and shown that the responses are mediated by short-duration channel openings consonant with single-ligand gated openings of the Cl- channels. We presently investigate whether responses of cultured rat hippocampal neurones to 4-PIOL are modulated by benzodiazepine (BDZ) and barbiturate receptor ligands. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of maximal responses to 1 mM 4-PIOL were comparable in size to responses evoked by 10 microM of the full GABAA agonist, isoguvacine. The BDZ receptor inverse agonist, DMCM (1 microM) reduced responses to isoguvacine (to 65.7 +/- 11.0%) and 4-PIOL (to 69.3 +/- 3.5%) to a similar extent. The BDZ agonist, midazolam (0.1 microM) potentiated responses to both agonists, and resulted in responses with an early peak with later fading. Potentiation of the peak response to 4-PIOL (to 163 +/- 14%) was significantly less than for isoguvacine (215 +/- 11%). Pentobarbital (50 microM) caused a very marked, but variable, potentiation of the peak response to 4-PIOL (to 484 +/- 93%), which was significantly greater than the potentiation of the peak response to isoguvacine (to 304 +/- 46%), and induced fading. This suggests that a relatively larger number of the 4-PIOL-induced channel openings can be transformed to longer duration openings by pentobarbital. In conclusion, responses to 4-PIOL and isoguvacine are modulated by BDZ and barbiturate ligands in a qualitatively similar manner, but with a number of quantitative differences which cannot be readily explained by the kinetic model of Macdonald and Twyman (1992). Investigation of these responses at the single-channel level could provide further insight into the operation of the GABAA receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "50": "The effects of the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam on GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition were investigated in area CA3 of hippocampal slice cultures. Midazolam (100 nM) increased the decay time constant (tau OFF) of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded from pyramidal cells by approximately 40%, but did not significantly affect their activation rate or amplitude, consistent with saturation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors by a quantum of GABA. Non-stationary variance analysis of mIPSCs revealed that the unitary conductance of synaptic GABAA channels (approximately 31 pS) was unaffected by midazolam. Midazolam increased not only the tau OFF (51%), but also the amplitude (23%) of unitary IPSPs, recorded from pairs of monosynaptically connected inhibitory and pyramidal cells. Simulation of unitary IPSPs indicated that the increased amplitude was primarily due to the slow time constant of pyramidal cells. Finally, the mean amplitude, tau OFF, and single-channel conductance of mIPSCs recorded in cultures chronically exposed to midazolam (0.1-10 microM) for 2 weeks were not different from control mIPSCs, nor was their response to midazolam. We conclude that benzodiazepines increase synaptic GABAA channel open time, as described previously, and that this results in an increase in both the amplitude and duration of IPSPs in pyramidal cells.", 
    "51": "Clinico-biological examination of 50 alcoholic patients was carried out. 30 patients were treated with lerivon (L) during 1 month. 15 control patients received amitriptylin for 1 month and 15 patients received relanium for 7 days. It was determined that L was quite effective in treatment of depression in alcoholic patients. The main L effects were anxiolytic, antidepressive and hypnotic. The drug also decreased alcohol addiction, had vegetostabilising and sedative effects. The conclusion was made on pathogenetic action of L in alcoholism: It influences upon dopaminergic mediation in catecholamine system. Administration of L permitted to normalize neurochemical processes underlying alcohol addiction and depression. L was well tolerated. Side effects complications, drug addiction were not registered.", 
    "52": "The effect of short-term heat exposure in a Finnish sauna on hepatic first-pass metabolism and the capacity to metabolize midazolam were studied in a crossover trial. Midazolam oral (15 mg) and intravenous (0.05 mg.kg-1) was given to 6 healthy young male volunteers, in random order, during a control session and a sauna bathing session (temperature 85-100 degrees C, relative humidity 25-30%). Blood samples for the determination of plasma midazolam and alpha-hydroxy midazolam concentrations were taken for 6 h after drug administration.", 
    "53": "After oral administration, the bioavailability and clearance of midazolam were not affected by sauna bathing, nor was there a significant difference in alpha-hydroxy midazolam plasma concentration or the alpha-hydroxy midazolam/midazolam AUC-ratio between the sessions. Midazolam Cmax was increased and its t1/2 beta was prolonged during the sauna session, but the clinical relevance of the findings appears to be modest. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous midazolam were not affected by sauna bathing.",

    "55": "An iodinated analog of PK11195, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline-3-carboxamide , a specific antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (omega 3), has been synthesized in three steps with an overall chemical yield of 40%. Both [123I]- and [125I]-Iodo-PK11195 have been synthesized by solid-state isotopic exchange in > 60% isolated radiochemical yield and specific activity of 233-348 mCi/mmol. Tissue distribution studies in rats indicate a high uptake of radioactivity in adrenal glands, heart, lung and kidneys, which was blocked 63-87% by preadministration of cold PK11195. Single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging of the canine heart has been accomplished with [123I]PK11195. These results suggest that [123I]PK11195 has potential as a SPECT radiotracer for studying the omega 3 receptor in humans.", 
    "56": "Non-cognitive symptoms are common in dementia. Emotional disturbances such as depression, anxiety and irritability-aggressiveness dominate. Depression is seen in about one third of demented persons. There are findings indicating that degenerative changes in the brain can cause depressive changes. Depression in elderly and in dementia differs from that in younger ages but no diagnostic criteria have yet been evaluated. Anxiety is a common symptom in depression suggesting a depressive-anxiety disorder. Specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) are efficient in the treatment of both depression and anxiety while tricyclic antidepressants have side effects including cognitive reduction. Irritability and aggressiveness respond to the treatment with SSRI drugs. Such drugs as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, especially those with anticholinergic effects, can reduce cognitive function in elderly and demented persons but the knowledge, this side effect is insufficient. Antipsychotics without anticholinergic effects should be used for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in demented persons.", 
    "57": "L-365,260, a specific and potent nonpeptide antagonist of the CCKB receptor, is under investigation for its potential utility in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders. This drug has a very low aqueous solubility (< 2 micrograms mL-1). When L-365,260 was given orally as a suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose (5 mg kg-1), the absorption was rapid but incomplete. The peak concentrations occurred in about 30-40 min, and the bioavailability was 8.6% for the dog and 13.6% for the rat. The poor bioavailability could be attributed to poor absorption or extensive first-pass metabolism. By comparing the drug concentrations in the systemic circulation during portal and femoral (or cephalic) vein infusion, the hepatic first-pass metabolism was estimated to be 0.30 for the rat and 0.14 for the dog, suggesting that first-pass metabolism is not the main reason for the low bioavailability of the drug in rats and dogs. The limited bioavailability is, therefore, more likely due to its poor absorption as a result of its poor aqueous solubility and slow dissolution rate. However, while the absorption was substantially improved when the drug was given orally as a solution in PEG 600 solution, the bioavailability increased threefold to fourfold in rats and sixfold to sevenfold in dogs. Although the underlying mechanism for the improved absorption is unknown, PEG 600 may have exerted a cosolubilizing effect which enhances the dissolution rate of L-365,260 in the GI tract, resulting in better absorption. Kinetic analysis by a deconvolution technique revealed that PEG 600 increased both the extent and rate of absorption. These results are consistent with the notion that absorption of L-365,260 is rate limited by its dissolution rate. The data from these animal studies provides valuable information in selecting the formulation for clinical trials.", 
    "58": "Electroencephalographic and clinical signs of epileptoid activity have been associated with the administration of fentanyl during surgery in patients. These phenomena have been in turn related to changes in metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and blood flow in specific brain structures both in humans and experimental animals. However, direct evidence showing changes in neuronal firing in specific brain regions during fentanyl-induced epileptoid activity has not been reported. Eight adult male cats with chronically implanted bipolar electrodes in the mesencephalic reticular formation, hippocampus, amygdala, and parieto-occipital cortex were included in the study. Different treatments, i.e., vehicle-fentanyl or diazepam-fentanyl, were administered to the experimental animals at 7-day intervals under neuromuscular blockade and assisted ventilation. Electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures, grouped and isolated spikes, and significant increases of multineuronal activity (MUA) were elicited by fentanyl, 50 micrograms/kg iv, in these brain structures. Both EEG and MUA changes reached their maximal values within 6 min of fentanyl administration, and then diminished as time elapsed. Diazepam, 100, 200, or 400 micrograms/kg, but not 50 micrograms/kg iv, significantly reduced or prevented the fentanyl-induced epileptoid EEG activity and MUA increases. The present results show that both fentanyl-induced epileptoid EEG activity as well as the concomitant increase in MUA of brain subcortical structures are part of the same epileptogenic phenomenon, mainly generated at limbic structures. In addition, the effects of diazepam against both epileptoid EEG activity and increase of MUA of brain subcortical structures support the use of benzodiazepines as premedicants for fentanyl anesthesia in order to prevent or to reduce epileptoid phenomena that can result from opioid administration during the anesthetic procedures.", 
    "59": "Priapism of the clitoris is a rare entity. A case of painful priapism is reported in a patient who had previously suffered a radical cystectomy for bladder carcinoma pT3-GIII, followed by local recurrence in the pelvis. From a symptomatic point of view she showed a good response to conservative treatment (analgesics and anxiolytics), as she refused surgical treatment. She survived 6 months from the recurrence, and died with lung metastases. The priapism did not recur. The physiopathological mechanisms involved in the process are discussed and the literature reviewed.", 
    "60": "We have recently reported that a short-acting anesthetic and analgesic drug midazolam can produce analgesia and decrease morphine tolerance and dependence in the rat by interacting with the opioid system. This study was designed to investigate the effect of midazolam, morphine, and both together on beta-endorphin levels in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: (1) saline-saline; (2) saline-morphine; (3) midazolam-saline, and (4) midazolam-morphine groups. First, saline or midazolam injection was given IP and after 30 min a second injection of saline or morphine was given subcutaneously once daily for 11 days. Animals were sacrificed on 11th day 60 min after the last injection, to measure beta-endorphin by radioimmunoassay. Saline-morphine-treated animals showed a significant increase in beta-endorphin levels in the cortex, pons, medulla, lumbar spinal cord, adrenals, and spleen, and a decrease only in its level in pituitary. Midazolam-saline-treated animals showed a significant increase in beta-endorphin levels only in the medulla, and a decrease in its levels in hippocampus, striatum, and adrenals. Saline-morphine-treated animals did not show any changes in plasma beta-endorphin, but animals treated with midazolam-saline had a significant decrease in plasma beta-endorphin. In rats treated with morphine and midazolam together, beta-endorphin levels in cortex, lumbar spinal cord, and spleen decreased to the similar levels observed in rats treated with saline-saline; in pons and cervical spinal cord the levels were even lower than that found in saline-saline group. The decrease in pituitary beta-endorphin in morphine-midazolam-treated rats was due to morphine's own activity, whereas the decrease in plasma beta-endorphin in hippocampus in the morphine-midazolam group was a synergistic effect of morphine and midazolam. The beta-endorphin level in adrenal glands in the morphine-midazolam-treated animals was not different from that found in rats treated with morphine alone but was still higher than that in the saline-saline group. In general, it appears that chronic treatment with morphine stimulates the beta-endorphinergic system. A concomitant treatment with midazolam abolishes the stimulatory effect of morphine on the beta-endorphinergic system. These results may help us in understanding the intrinsic mechanisms involved in narcotic tolerance and dependence.", 
    "61": "Enantiomeric 3-O-methyltemazepam and 3-O-ethyltemazepam were highly stereoselectively substituted by the 3-methoxy group of methanol in acidic anhydrous methanol and by the 3-ethoxy group of ethanol in acidic anhydrous ethanol, respectively. The stereoselectivity of the homonucleophilic substitution reactions was determined by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In anhydrous solutions containing 0.5 M D2SO4 at 50 degrees C, for example, the stereoselectivity was approximately 63:1 for enantiomeric 3-O-methyltemazepam in CD3OD and approximately 94:1 for enantiomeric 3-O-ethyltemazepam in C2D5OD. The high stereoselectivity at C3 position was primarily due to the presence of a methyl group at N1 position.", 
    "62": "Three experiments investigated the effects of midazolam on acquisition of fear-mediated analgesic responses in rats conditioned on the heated floor of a hot-plate apparatus. Experiment 1 demonstrated that a moderate dose (1.25 mg/kg) of midazolam administered prior to conditioning impaired acquisition of conditioned analgesia in rats retested on the heated floor 24 h later. This effect of midazolam was reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. In contrast, in Experiment 2, the same or higher (2.5 mg/kg) dose of midazolam did not appear to affect the acquisition of conditioned analgesia in rats tested 24 h later with a formalin-injected paw on the non-heated floor of the hot plate apparatus. By testing rats with the opioid antagonist naloxone, Experiment 3 revealed that the higher dose of midazolam did disrupt the acquisition of conditioned analgesia in rats tested with formalin, but only by preventing acquisition of an immediate but brief analgesic response that was insensitive to naloxone. Midazolam was shown to have no effect on the acquisition of the enduring naloxone-reversible analgesia. These results are discussed in terms of benzodiazepines acting within the amygdala to produce a retrieval deficit whereby fear conditioning that takes place under the influence of a benzodiazepine can only be accessed if the animal is tested in the presence of ongoing noxious stimulation.",

    "64": "Ketamine was supposed to be contra-indicated in head injured patients although it possesses numerous advantages over other commonly used analgosedative drugs. Referring to these potential advantages and the lack of definitive data about its effect upon ICP, CPP or neurological development, we conducted a prospective study in which moderate or severely head injured patients (n = 35) were prospectively allocated to receive treatment either with a combination of ketamine or midazolam or fentanyl and midazolam. The initial dose was 6.5 mg/kg/day midazolam, 65 mg/kg/day ketamine or 65 micrograms/kg/day fentanyl and was later adjusted due to clinical requirements for a period of 3 to 14 days. Comparably high dosages of ketamine [corrected] have been found necessary (104 mg/kg/day). Four patients from the ketamine group (n = 17) and 5 from the control group (n = 18) were withdrawn during treatment due to persistent ICP above 25 mm Hg, countermeasured by barbiturate coma. Two more patients were withdrawn due to development of cardiovascular arrest (ketamine group) and multi organ failure. A comparison of the remaining patients revealed a lower requirement of catecholamines (significant on first day, p<0.05), an on average 8 mm Hg higher cerebral perfusion pressure and a 2 mm Hg higher intracranial pressure in the study [corrected] group. Enteral food intake was better in the study group. The outcome was comparable in both groups with or without inclusion of withdrawn patients.",

Samples were decontaminated with dichloromethane and pulverized. 50 mg of powdered hair were incubated 2 h at 40 degrees C in a phosphate buffer pH 7.6 in presence of deuterated internal standards (Nordiazepam-d5 and Oxazepam-d5) and extracted by a mixture ether/chloroform (80:20, v/v) at pH 8.4. After evaporation of the solvent, the dry extract was derivatized by silylation (BSTFA + 1% TMCS) and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, with a detector operating in negative chemical ionization mode. 13 samples tested positive for Nordiazepam with concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 18.87 ng/mg of hair (mean: 4.16 ng/mg) and 5 positives for its metabolite, Oxazepam, with concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 0.50 ng/mg of hair (mean : 0.28 ng/mg).", 
    "66": "We investigated the contribution of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic system to spatial and nonspatial aspects of learning and memory that had previously been found to correlate with the extent of the hippocampal intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber projection in different inbred mouse strains. The following cholinergic and GABAergic markers were measured in the septi and hippocampi of male mice: the number of cholinergic and parvalbumin-containing neurons in the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/vDB), the number of septo-hippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic projection neurons, the density of cholinergic fibers in different hippocampal subfields, and the density of muscarinic receptors (predominantly M1 and M2) in the hippocampus. In addition, animals were behaviorally tested for spatially dependent and activity-dependent variables in a water maze and spatial and nonspatial working and reference memory in different experimental set-ups in an eight-arm radial maze. Using only those variables for which significant strain differences were obtained, we looked for covariations between behavior and neuroanatomy. The density of cholinergic fibers in the dentate gyrus was significantly correlated with activity-dependent learning in the water maze, whereas the number of septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection neurons correlated with spatial and, to a lesser extent, also with nonspatial aspects of radial maze learning. Only weak correlations were found between receptor densities and behavioral traits. From these data we conclude that variations in the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system, like variations in the mossy fiber projection, entail functional consequences for different types of maze learning in mice.", 
    "67": "In a previous study we have shown that microinjection of the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam into the medial preoptic area increases sleep in rats. In order to determine whether this effect is specific to benzodiazepines, or whether it occurs with hypnotic medications from other pharmacologic classes, we have microinjected pentobarbital (1 and 100 micrograms) and vehicle in random sequence into rats and performed two hour sleep studies in the daytime with the lights on. Both doses significantly decreased sleep latency and increased nonREM and total sleep. The amount of REM sleep, REM latency, and intermittent waking time were not significantly altered. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the medial preoptic area may be involved in sleep induction by both benzodiazepine and barbiturate hypnotic medications.",

    "77": "Advances in the neurosciences, concerns about cost containment, and a growing consumer advocacy movement are creating new hopes and challenges for the development of more effective and cost-effective treatments for persons with psychotic disorders. Using the development of new antipsychotic agents for the treatment of schizophrenia as a prototype, this article examines the assessment of outcomes of treatments for these patients. Psychotic disorders exert a broad range of negative effects on patients' lives. This requires a broad view of outcomes to assess the relative effectiveness of alternative pharmacotherapies. The outcomes of interest cover the clinical, rehabilitative, humanitarian, and public welfare domains. Most of our knowledge about the efficacy of antipsychotic agents focuses on improvements in and prevention of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, better antipsychotic medications must show advantages above and beyond symptom suppression. We need to know not only whether alternative medications offer advantages in these other dimensions of outcome, but also how they interact with psychosocial treatments to enhance outcomes, how effective they are with patients in usual practices settings, and how cost-effective they are relative to other treatments. A research agenda for evaluating these impacts must include longer term outcome studies that evaluate the wider range of outcomes of interest to practitioners, patients, families, and payers.", 
    "78": "Long-term outcomes for patients with schizophrenia have been disappointing. The article discusses how the typical antipsychotics (clozapine and risperidone) as well as several agents that should be available in the near future (olanzapine, sertindole, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) might improve outcome and then focuses on antipsychotic relapse rates and the newly released antipsychotic olanzapine. Considerable evidence shows that relapse rates for compliant patients maintained on atypical antipsychotics are substantially lower than rates for those maintained on conventional antipsychotics. Also, the decreased extrapyramidal symptom liability of the newer medications will make it easier to prescribe more effective doses of antipsychotic that can maximize relapse prevention without simultaneously interfering with the patient's quality of life or motor functioning. The authors describe clinical observations of olanzapine based on their 3 years of clinical experience using this agent in a phase 3 clinical trial. They suggest that as atypical antipsychotics like olanzapine are more widely used, some problems associated with the long-term use of conventional antipsychotics will diminish, but other issues and concerns will be more common. In particular: (1) Despite their better side effect profiles, atypical antipsychotics will not solve the noncompliance problem. A significant proportion of patients with schizophrenia will still need depot therapy. (2) There will be problems arising from \"awakenings\" phenomena where patients will become more in touch with their losses and painful inner feelings. It seems likely that the need for rehabilitation services will be increased as more patients improve to the point where they will be amenable to psychiatric rehabilitation.", 
    "79": "Although neuroleptic drugs have become the mainstay of treating acute and chronic psychosis, they are substantially limited by troublesome side effects. The traditional neuroleptic drugs have a wide array of central nervous system and peripheral system side effects that often lead to problems in management or patient noncompliance. Of particular difficulty are the extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. However, other side effects of seizures, sedation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and cardiovascular, hematologic, endocrinological, and weight gain problems remain as clinical management challenges posed by existing antipsychotic drug therapy. Considerable progress has been made in improving the motor side effect profile with the advent of clozapine and risperidone. However, each of these drugs has its own dose-limiting side effect profile. Two new drugs, olanzapine and sertindole, are now added to the pharmacopeia for treating psychosis. They further improve the benefit/ risk ratio because they have even fewer EPS and other side effects. Overall, these new antipsychotic agents greatly improve the treatment of psychosis by reducing drug-induced morbidity and improving the quality of life for patients.", 
    "80": "Cognitive impairment is a relatively frequent aspect of schizophrenia. Deficits are most prominent in tasks involving attention, memory, and executive function. Although some research suggests that deterioration is progressive, these deficits appear to be relatively stable over time. Imaging and biochemical studies show that schizophrenia is characterized by a number of morphological, hemodynamic, and neurochemical abnormalities within systems integrating the cortex, temporal lobes, and various limbic structures. Neurochemical assays suggest that the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate play a significant role in the disease-associated decrement. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia impedes psychosocial performance and eventual reintegration into society and is therefore an especially relevant target in the development of new therapeutic modalities. Atypical agents, such as clozapine and olanzapine, hold special promise in this area.", 
    "81": "This review will focus on three categories of poor response of patients with schizophrenia to an antipsychotic medication. The first category includes patients who continue to demonstrate positive psychotic symptoms when they receive adequate trials of an antipsychotic. These individuals may improve when their drug doses are altered or when they receive other drugs such as lithium or benzodiazepines in addition to their antipsychotic. Clozapine has been shown to result in substantial improvement in a majority of these patients. Additional evidence suggests that risperidone will also be effective in these individuals. The second category of poor responders consists of patients who are unable to tolerate the side effects of antipsychotics. These individuals may respond when they are changed to a newer antipsychotic. The third category includes patients who have persistent negative symptoms while they are treated with an antipsychotic. There is substantial evidence that these patients will demonstrate improvement in negative symptoms when they receive clozapine and risperidone as well as newer antipsychotics including olanzapine, sertindole, and quetiapine.", 
    "82": "The chronic effects of antidepressant drugs (ADs) on circadian rhythms of behavior, physiology and endocrinology are reviewed. The timekeeping properties of several classes of ADs, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin agonists and antagonists, benzodiazepines, and melatonin are reviewed. Pharmacological effects on the circadian amplitude and phase, as well as effects on day-night measurements of motor activity, sleep-wake, body temperature (Tb), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, cortisol, thyroid hormone, prolactin, growth hormone and melatonin are examined. ADs often lower nocturnal Tb and affect the homeostatic regulation of sleep. ADs often advance the timing and decrease the amount of slow wave sleep, reduce rapid eye movement sleep and increase or decrease arousal. Together, AD effects on nocturnal Tb and sleep may be related to their therapeutic properties. ADs sometimes delay nocturnal cortisol timing and increase nocturnal melatonin, thyroid hormone and prolactin levels; these effects often vary with diagnosis, and clinical state. The effects of ADs on the coupling of the central circadian pacemaker to photic and nonphotic zeitgebers are discussed.", 
    "83": "Effects of a benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), on neuroendocrine responses to emotional stimuli were studied in male rats. In the experiments with conditioned fear stimuli, rats received a pure tone paired with footshocks in the training session and were tested on the following day with the same environmental stimuli. CDP injected i.p. 30 min before training impaired the suppressive vasopressin and the augmentative oxytocin or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) responses to the conditioned fear stimuli. However, the drug, administered 30 min after the training, did not significantly alter the hormonal responses to conditioned fear stimuli. CDP administered 30 min before testing also abolished the hormonal responses to conditioned fear stimuli. The stimuli which were identical to those used for training or unconditioned fear stimuli (intermittent footshocks) also produced the vasopressin, oxytocin and ACTH responses, and CDP prevented these hormonal responses. The drug, however, did not prevent the hormonal responses to novel environmental stimuli. Novel stimuli are known to produce a state of anxiety. Thus the present experiments demonstrate that CDP discriminates between the neural circuits mediating fear- and anxiety-producing stimuli in the rat.", 
    "84": "The antipsychotic drug olanzapine is similar to clozapine and risperidone in potent serotonergic antagonism. We assessed obsessive-compulsive symptoms during olanzapine treatment because these symptoms have been reported during risperidone and clozapine treatment. Obsessions and compulsions were measured in 25 subjects with schizophrenia before and after a 6-week double-blind trial comparing two olanzapine doses to placebo. At baseline, 8 subjects had mild or moderate obsessions, and 6 had mild compulsions. There was no significant difference in the course of obsessive-compulsive symptoms among the three treatment groups. We found that olanzapine did not appear to cause obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Our sample size, the dose and duration of olanzapine treatment, and assessment methods limit the extent to which this finding can be generalized. Though emerging obsessive-compulsive symptoms have been reported for 13 clozapine-treated and 2 risperidone-treated patients with schizophrenia, this phenomenon has not yet been demonstrated in a controlled study.", 
    "85": "In a prospective 4 year followup study, 423 panic disorder patients participated in one of two international multicenter drug trials. They were to be reinterviewed 4 years after leaving the trials; 367 (86.8%) interviews were completed. At followup, 3 of 5 patients still suffered from at least occasional panic attacks, and 2 of 5 were still agoraphobic, but only about 20 percent of the patients were still disabled. The only baseline variables that predicted disabilities at followup were the disability measures at baseline themselves. Neither panic attack frequency nor phobic avoidance at baseline predicted disability at followup. Because of the lack of association between the presence of symptoms and of social disabilities, future clinical trials and other clinical and epidemiological studies should use independent symptom measures and quality-of-life measures simultaneously."
