A case is reported of an accidental staggered overdose of clidinium bromide 50 mg in a patient using illicit chlordiazepoxide. The presenting features were mildly dilated pupils and palpitation secondary to sinus tachycardia that persisted for 11 h after the time of first ingestion. Emergency physicians should be aware of the potential for antimuscarinic toxicity in patients using illicit chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "1": "Alterations in hippocampal GABA(A)/central benzodiazepine receptor (GABA(A)/cBZR) expression and mossy fibre sprouting (MFS) may have aetiological significance in temporal lobe epileptogenesis. Their relationship with each other is also unknown. We utilised [3H]-flumazenil autoradiography to quantify changes in GABA(A)/cBZR density and affinity in all hippocampal laminae, and Timm's staining for MFS at different stages of epileptogenesis in the amygdala kindling rat model (after 24 stimulations, 48 stimulations and two weeks post-kindling). During kindling, receptor density was significantly elevated within the dentate stratum moleculare and granulosum, but decreased within the stratum radiatum of CA3 and CA2. Two weeks post-kindling, receptor density remained upregulated in the dentate stratum moleculare and was also upregulated in CA3 stratum oriens and CA1 stratum moleculare. MFS was significantly increased in the dentate stratum moleculare at two weeks post-kindling, with a strong inverse correlation between MFS and GABA(A)/cBZR density in this region. No changes in GABA(A)/cBZR binding affinity were detected for any hippocampal subregion at any time point. Our results demonstrate that changes in hippocampal GABA(A)/cBZR expression are lamina- and time-specific. Within the dentate gyrus, receptor density is upregulated throughout epileptogenesis, whilst within the hippocampus proper, receptor density is downregulated early in epileptogenesis but upregulated at the chronic phase. A novel association between MFS and GABA(A)/cBZR density has been demonstrated by this study, which could represent an important compensatory or pathological mechanism associated with epileptogenesis.",

This was compared to the localization of the lesion on the MRI scan.", 
    "4": "The principal component was found in the beta/gamma band. In all patients one region of decreased change was associated with the lesional hemisphere, and overlapped with the site of the lesion in four. Three patients underwent surgery: interictal corticographic findings concurred with the area of decreased benzodiazepine response.",

    "7": "This paper describes a sweeping-micellar electrokinetic chromatography (sweeping-MEKC) technique for the determination of seven benzodiazepines, using, as sweeping carriers, the ionic liquid-type cationic surfactants 1-cetyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (C(16)MIMBr) and N-cetyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bromide (C(16)MPYB). These surfactants resemble the commonly employed cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), but they provide different separation efficiencies. We optimized the separation and sweeping conditions, including the pH, the concentrations of organic modifier and surfactant, and the sample injection volume. Adding C(16)MIMBr or C(16)MPYB to the background electrolyte enhanced the separation efficiency and detection sensitivity during the sweeping-MEKC analyses of the benzodiazepines. C(16)MIMBr enhanced the sensitivity for each benzodiazepine 31-59-fold; C(16)MPYB, 86-165-fold. In the presence of C(16)MPYB, the limits of detection for the seven analytes ranged from 4.68 to 9.75 ng/mL. We adopted the sweeping-MEKC conditions optimized for C(16)MPYB to satisfactorily analyze a human urine sample spiked with the seven benzodiazepines. To minimize the matrix effects, we subjected this urine sample to off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) prior to analysis. The recoveries of the analytes after SPE were satisfactory (ca. 77.0-88.3%). Our experimental results reveal that the cationic surfactant C(16)MPYB exhibits superior sweeping power relative to those of C(16)MIMBr and CTAB and that it can be applied in sweeping-MEKC analyses for the on-line concentrating and analyzing of benzodiazepines present in real samples at nanogram-per-milliliter concentrations.", 
    "8": "We developed an inexpensive computer vision-based method utilizing an algorithm which differentiates drug-induced behavioral alterations. The mice were observed in an open-field arena and their activity was recorded for 100 min. For each animal the first 50 min of observation were regarded as the drug-free period. Each animal was exposed to only one drug and they were injected (i.p.) with either amphetamine or cocaine as the stimulant drugs or morphine or diazepam as the inhibitory agents. The software divided the arena into virtual grids and calculated the number of visits (sojourn counts) to the grids and instantaneous speeds within these grids by analyzing video data. These spatial distributions of sojourn counts and instantaneous speeds were used to construct feature vectors which were fed to the classifier algorithms for the final step of matching the animals and the drugs. The software decided which of the animals were drug-treated at a rate of 96%. The algorithm achieved 92% accuracy in sorting the data according to the increased or decreased activity and then determined which drug was delivered. The method differentiated the type of psychostimulant or inhibitory drugs with a success ratio of 70% and 80%, respectively. This method provides a new way to automatically evaluate and classify drug-induced behaviors in mice.", 
    "9": "Typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol exert their therapeutic effects via blockade of dopamine (DA) D(2) receptors, leading to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in humans and catalepsy in rodents. In contrast, atypical antipsychotics and new generation D(2)/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics have low cataleptogenic potential. However, there has been no systematic comparative study on the effects of these different classes of antipsychotics in non-human primates, a species displaying a more sophisticated repertoire of behavioural/motor activity than rats. Once weekly, six young adult female non-haloperidol-sensitised cynomolgus monkeys were treated i.m. with a test compound and videotaped to score catalepsy-associated behaviour (CAB: static postures, unusual positions and crouching). Haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, nemonapride and remoxipride induced, to different extents, an increase in unusual positions (a response akin to dystonia), some crouching and static postures. In contrast, clozapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole produced much lower or no unusual positions; clozapine also produced marked increases in static postures and crouching. Among novel D(2)/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics, SLV313 and F15063 augmented the number of unusual positions, albeit at doses 16-63 times higher than those of haloperidol for approximately the same score. SSR181507 and bifeprunox produced moderate static postures, little crouching and negligible unusual positions. These data provide the first comparative analysis in cynomolgus monkeys of EPS liability of conventional, atypical and novel D(2)/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics. They indicate that the latter are less prone than haloperidol to produce CAB, and provide a basis for comparison with rodent catalepsy studies.",

    "14": "The effect of nanomolar concentrations of PBR/TSPO ligands--Ro 5-4864, PK11195, and PPIX--on Ca2+-induced permeability transition pore (PTP) opening in isolated rat brain mitochondria was investigated. PBR/TSPO agonist Ro 5-4864 (100 nM) and endogenous ligand PPIX (1 microM) were shown to stimulate PTP opening, while antagonist PK11195 (100 nM) suppressed this process. Correlation between PBR ligand action on PTP opening and phosphorylation of a 3.5 kDa polypeptide was investigated. In intact brain mitochondria, incorporation of [gamma-(32)P]ATP into 3.5 kDa peptide was decreased in the presence of Ro 5-4864 and PPIX and increased in the presence of PK11195. At threshold Ca2+ concentrations leading to PTP opening, PBR/TSPO ligands were found to stimulate dephosphorylation of the 3.5 kDa peptide. Specific anti-PBR/TSPO antibody prevented both PTP opening and dephosphorylation of the 3.5-kDa peptide. The peptide was identified as subunit c of F(o)F(1)-ATPase by Western blot using specific anti-subunit c antibody. The results suggest that subunit c of F(o)F(1)-ATPase could be an additional target for PBR/TSPO ligands action, is subjected to Ca2+- and TSPO-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and is involved in PTP operation in mitochondria.", 
    "15": "Crisis management during regional anesthesia including peripheral nerve block, epidural anesthesia and spinal anesthesia was reviewed. Common crisis which is encountered during regional anesthesia includes toxic reaction to local anesthetic drugs, allergic reaction induced by local anesthetic drugs, reaction induced by epinephrine, nerve injury, hematoma etc. Concerning peripheral nerve block, crisis encountered during brachial plexus block, interscalene block and supraclavicular block used for surgical operation of upper extremity was discussed. On the other hands, there are various common crises encountered during epidural anesthesia and spinal anesthesia. These crises include hypotension, bradycardia, total spinal anesthesia, postspinal headache and infection, and hematoma in the spinal canal. Especially, epidural hematoma and epidural abcess have possibility to cause nerve defect symptoms such as motor paralysis and sensory disturbance if appropriate treatment was not started in early stage. Moreover crisis such as cauda equina syndrome and anterior spinal cord syndrome have possibility to remain permanent and hard to cure. We anesthesiologists should make efforts to prevent crisis, to detect crisis in early stage, and to treat it in early stage.", 
    "16": "This study was designed to determine whether HCO(3)(-) and Cl(-) are required for the activation of the GABA(A) receptor/Cl(-) channel (GBRC) by GABA and the subsequent capacitation of rat sperm. Spermatozoa from adult Sprague Dawley rats were incubated in four different media: modified complete rat fertilization medium (mRFM), Cl(-)-deficient (Cl(-)-DF) mRFM, HCO(3)(-)-DF mRFM, and Cl(-)-DF HCO(3)(-)-DF mRFM, with or without GBRC agonists (GABA and progesterone) or GBRC antagonists (bicuculline and picrotoxin) for 0-6 h under capacitating conditions. Sperm capacitation and hyperactivation were assessed by chlortetracycline staining and computer-assisted sperm analysis, respectively. The results showed that GABA added to the mRFM accelerated capacitation and hyperactivation, followed by increase in the acrosome reaction, reaching maximum value after 5 h. Progesterone also accelerated sperm capacitation and hyperactivation. Bicuculline and picrotoxin, antagonists of GABA, blocked the effects of both GABA and progesterone acceleration of sperm capacitation and hyperactivation. Sperm capacitation required both Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-). These results indicate that activation of GBRC may contribute to sperm capacitation and hyperactivation, and that both HCO(3)(-) and Cl(-) are essential. This is the first report of a close relationship between HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) transport and the activation of GBRC in rat sperm capacitation and hyperactivation.",

All agents (P < 0.01) reduced DNMTP accuracy at short delays; post hoc analyses revealed that only 0.1 mg/kg asenapine and 0.3 mg/kg risperidone differed from vehicle. All active agents (asenapine, 0.3 mg/kg; olanzapine, 0.03-0.3 mg/kg; and risperidone, 0.01-0.1 mg/kg) significantly impaired 5-CSR accuracy (P < 0.05).",

Patients who remained in treatment showed statistically significant improvement in ASI scores for problems related to drug use and for psychiatric, medical, and legal problems. They showed a nonsignificant trend toward reduction of problems associated with alcohol use. The group of patients who dropped out of methadone treatment did not show statistically significant improvement on any area of the ASI except family problems.

    "26": "The use of medications on a p.r.n. basis on psychiatric inpatient wards is common and widespread but without clear evidence of effectiveness. While individual studies have explored the use of p.r.n. medications in patients receiving scheduled psychotropic medications, no systematic review of the effectiveness of this use of p.r.n. medications has been done. A MEDLINE search was performed of all articles published in English between 1966 and November 2008. Studies were included only if they involved psychiatric patients and if they quantitatively explored the effectiveness of p.r.n. medications. Ten retrospective studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. Among the studies involving adult inpatients, estimates of effectiveness, primarily in the management of agitation, were consistently moderately high, averaging approximately 75%. These studies mainly involved use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Lower estimates of about 30% were obtained in studies involving non-adult inpatients who had few psychotic disorders and among whom there was only minimal use of p.r.n. benzodiazepines. The meaning of effectiveness was often unclear across these retrospective studies. It also appears that important outcome measures, such as duration of hospitalization, may not be affected. Administration of p.r.n. medication was also associated with a greater risk of adverse events. Future studies concerning use of p.r.n. medications in psychiatric patients should examine objective ratings of agitation, medication effects, and adverse events.", 
    "27": "Human models of anxiety are useful to develop new effective anxiolytics. The objective of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that a single dose of lorazepam modifies brain activation during an anxiety challenge. Eighteen healthy male subjects underwent fMRI associated with a challenge based on the anticipation of aversive electrical stimulations after pretreatment, either with placebo or with 1.0 mg of oral lorazepam. Anxiety was rated before fMRI and after, referring to the threat condition periods, using State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Hamilton scales. The conditioning procedure induced anxiety, as indicated by clinical rating score changes. Lorazepam did not modify anxiety rating as compared to placebo. Lorazepam reduced cerebral activity in superior frontal gyrus, anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus. The current finding provides the first evidence of the modulatory effects of an established anxiolytic agent on brain activation related to anticipatory anxiety.",

Varenicline is a highly selective partial agonist of the alpha(4)beta(2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha(4)beta(2) receptor). The partial agonistic binding leads to alleviation of symptoms of craving and withdrawal, and simultaneously prevents nicotine from binding to the alpha(4)beta(2) receptor thereby causing reduction in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking.

All patients with suicidal events either had a past medical history of psychiatric illness prior to starting varenicline and/or a precipitating factor for the event. Clinicians should closely monitor patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness who are taking varenicline. Further evaluation of events of interest including psychiatric events is ongoing.

    "33": "Accidental falls, especially those occurring in the elderly, are a major health and research topic nowadays. Besides environmental hazards and the physiological changes associated with aging, medication use (e.g. benzodiazepines, vasodilators and antidepressants) and polypharmacy are significant risk factors for falling as well. Exposure to NSAIDs has been associated with accidental falls too, although information on this area is less consistent. Therefore, the main goal of this review is to provide an updated overview of all the evidence published on the risk of falling due to NSAID use thus far. A systematic literature search for material published between 1966 and March 2008 in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Exerpta Medica, Current Contents and Science Citation Index was combined with a check of the reference lists of all the retrieved articles. Validity and data extraction of the eligible articles was assessed by adapted criteria, based on checklists that were originally developed to assess case-control or cohort studies. From the 16 selected articles, two studies were rejected because of clustering of data and one article was excluded because it contained the same data as that in one of the included articles. None of the articles retrieved included a randomized controlled trial. The remaining 13 studies all showed some lack in completeness of their statistical methods, and much variation in reporting of effects. The overall mean age was high in the study populations, leaving the results to be poorly generalizable to a larger population and other age categories. Despite these imperfections, all studies showed an increased risk of falling due to NSAID use (four significant, nine non-significant), and a tendency towards an increased fall risk with NSAID exposure could be noted. The results shown in the present review suggest that an increased risk for accidental falls is probable when elderly individuals are exposed to NSAIDs. The studies with the highest quality show that the community-dwelling elderly in particular appear to be at higher risk. This review can serve as a comprehensive overview of the published evidence on fall risk of elderly individuals attributable to the use of NSAIDs, and as an inducement for future research.", 
    "34": "A 23-member library of pyrrolobenzodiazepine derivatives with vasopressin agonist activity was purified on a 100-mg per injection scale using normal-phase (NP) automated mass-directed HPLC. Analytical NP APCI-LC/MS on an experimental monolith silica CN column utilizing gradients of methanol in ethoxynonafluorobutane (hexane-like solvent) was used to provide data on chromatographic purity and ionization of the solutes. The analytical data collected were used to program a preparative LC/MS instrument for \"smart\" fraction collection based on the protonated molecular ion of the component of interest. Preparative HPLC was carried out on a preparative cyano column with gradients of polar organic solvents in heptane containing n-propylamine as a basic additive. Flow rates twice as high as conventional ones were used for purification of library compounds. Small aliquots of the preparative flow were mixed with makeup solvent and introduced into an APCI source of a quadrupole mass spectrometer, which triggered collection of solutes. Two methods with fixed instrument parameters were used for purification. The system utilized commercially available instrumentation and software, which provided excellent recovery and purity of the library components and appeared to be useful as a fast and efficient alternative to traditional purification technologies based on reversed-phase LC/MS.", 
    "35": "There are established drugs for the treatment of status epilepticus (SE) but their potentially hazardous side-effects are well known. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a novel anticonvulsant available for intravenous (i.v.) application. It could be an alternative when standard drugs fail or should be avoided. We retrospectively identified patients from two German teaching hospitals who were treated with LEV i.v. for SE. Their charts were reviewed regarding sociodemographic data, type, etiology, onset and duration of SE, dose of LEV, concurrent antiepileptic drugs (AED) treatment, tolerability, and outcome. Thirty-two patients (15 female) were found who were treated with i.v. LEV for SE (median age 71 years). Two patients were exclusively treated with LEV. Eight received a low and further 20 patients a high dose of benzodiazepines before LEV. Two patients were treated with LEV to enable discontinuation of narcosis. SE was generalized convulsive in five, nonconvulsive in 20, and simple focal in seven patients. Etiology was acute 13 times and remote symptomatic 16 times; three SE were of unknown etiology. Therapy was initiated within a median time of 3 h and LEV i.v. was applied within a median time of 6 h. Median LEV bolus was 2,000 mg; median total dose on day 1 was 3,500 mg. Benzodiazepines plus i.v. LEV terminated SE in 23 patients without application of additional anticonvulsants, 10 within 30 min. LEV could not terminate SE in seven patients. We documented nausea and emesis in one and elevation of liver enzymes in another patient that were likely to be attributed to LEV. LEV i.v. seems to be safe with relevant efficiency for the treatment of SE in elderly and multimorbid patients when comorbidity and respiratory insufficiency precludes high doses of benzodiazepines or phenytoin.",

Insomnia was significantly more likely to be managed for female patients (1.4%) than for males (1.1%). Female patients were therefore significantly over represented at insomnia encounters (66.0%) compared with total BEACH encounters (57.1%), as were patients with Commonwealth concession or Repatriation health cards. Patients new to the practice and patients from non-English speaking backgrounds were under represented at insomnia encounters compared with all encounters (Figure 1).", 
    "40": "We assessed the suitability of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol (4betaOH-C) as an endogenous cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) phenotyping metric. 4betaOH-C and its ratio to cholesterol (4betaOH-C/C) were determined in five cocktail phenotyping studies, with and without co-medication with a potential CYP3A inhibitor. These parameters were compared with established midazolam-based CYP3A metrics: clearance after intravenous (i.v.) administration (M-Cl) and apparent clearance after oral administration (M-Cl/F), reflecting hepatic and overall activity, respectively. In a common evaluation of periods without co-medication, there was a slight positive correlation of 4betaOH-C and 4betaOH-C/C with midazolam metrics: M-Cl (r = 0.239 and 0.348, respectively) and M-Cl/F (r = 0.267 and 0.353, respectively); P (one-sided) < 0.05. Co-medication with lopinavir/ritonavir caused a strong decrease in midazolam metrics and a mild decrease in cholesterol metrics. However, the intake of propiverine resulted in opposite trends for midazolam-based and cholesterol-based metrics. The information currently available does not justify the use of 4betaOH-C for estimation of basal CYP3A activity. Further studies to address the temporal variations in local CYP3A activity are needed to assess its role as a biomarker during CYP3A inhibition.", 
    "41": "GABA(A) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are major mediators of fast inhibitory neurotransmission. Clinically relevant GABA(A) receptor subtypes are assembled from alpha5(1-3, 5), beta1-3 and the gamma2 subunit. They exhibit a stoichiometry of two alpha, two beta and one gamma subunit, with two GABA binding sites located at the alpha/beta and one benzodiazepine binding site located at the alpha/gamma subunit interface. Introduction of the H105R point mutation into the alpha5 subunit, to render alpha5 subunit-containing receptors insensitive to the clinically important benzodiazepine site agonist diazepam, unexpectedly resulted in a reduced level of alpha5 subunit protein in alpha5(H105R) mice. In this study, we show that the alpha5(H105R) mutation did not affect cell surface expression and targeting of the receptors or their assembly into macromolecular receptor complexes but resulted in a severe reduction of alpha5-selective ligand binding. Immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the diminished alpha5-selective binding is presumably due to a repositioning of the alpha5(H105R) subunit in GABA(A) receptor complexes containing two different alpha subunits. These findings imply an important role of histidine 105 in determining the position of the alpha5 subunit within the receptor complex by determining the affinity for assembly with the gamma2 subunit.", 
    "42": "There is now clear evidence that the brain, similar to the adrenal gland, gonads, and placenta, is a steroidogenic organ. Notably in the frog brain, the presence of various steroidogenic enzymes has been detected by immunohistochemistry in specific populations of neurons and/or glial cells. These steroidogenic enzymes are biologically active, as shown by the ability of brain tissue explants to convert [(3)H]pregnenolone into various radiolabeled steroids. The frog brain has also been extensively used as a model to study the mechanism of regulation of neurosteroidogenesis by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. It has been demonstrated that the biosynthesis of neurosteroids is inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting through GABA(A) receptors, and neuropeptide Y, acting through Y1 receptors, and is stimulated by the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), acting through central-type benzodiazepine receptors, triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN), acting through peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, and vasotocin, acting through V1a-like receptors. These data indicate that some of the neurophysiological effects of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides may be mediated through modulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis.", 
    "43": "The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of an investigational diazepam (DZP) formulation and a parenteral midazolam (MDZ) formulation following intranasal (i.n.) administration for the efficient treatment of seizure emergencies.", 
    "44": "Each subject received 5 mg of DZP and MDZ via both i.n. and intravenous routes in a four-way, randomized crossover trial. Blood samples were collected over 48 h. DZP and MDZ concentrations were measured using HPLC. Using analog scales, subjects rated tolerability (0 = no change from normal; 10 = maximum intolerability) and pain (0 = no pain; 4 = extreme pain) prior to and 0, 5, 15, 60 min, and 8 h after administration.", 
    "45": "The C(max) and T(max) values for i.n. DZP and MDZ were 179.2 ng/ml and 28.8 min vs 62.8 ng/ml and 21.6 min, respectively. Immediately following i.n. administration, subjects reported tolerability scores of 6.75 and 6.0, and identical pain scores, 3.2, for DZP and MDZ, respectively.", 
    "46": "Both formulations were rapidly absorbed following i.n. administration with transient discomfort. DZP had a longer half-life, which may result in an extended duration of action. Further studies in large patient populations to evaluate the safety after long term use, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of i.n. DZP are warranted.", 
    "47": "There is a need for novel anxiolytics, which are effective, but do not cause sedation, tolerance, and rebound anxiety on discontinuation. To investigate a procedure that can be used to assess these characteristics preclinically, rats were initially trained to press a lever at a high rate to obtain food. Once trained, periods of punishment were introduced in which electric shocks were superimposed. The intensity of these electric shocks was increased every 90 s from very low (0.01 mA) to sufficiently high to stop most subjects responding (0.4 mA), so that a complete rate/intensity function was obtained during each punishment period. The benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, and two novel subtype-selective gamma-aminobutyric acid-A agonists, TP003 and TPA023, significantly increased response rates mildly suppressed by intermediate levels of electric shock without any effect on unpunished response rate. Two clinically anxiogenic agents, yohimbine and flumazenil, reduced the rate of punished responding. Aripiprazole and amphetamine reduced both punished and unpunished responding. Repeated treatment with diazepam 2.5 mg/kg daily for 15 days, initially markedly reduced unpunished response rates, but also increased punished response rates, an effect which became greater with repeated treatment. Abrupt cessation of diazepam treatment produced a reduction in punished responding. Diazepam (5 mg/kg daily) produced a greater reduction in unpunished responding, a smaller increase in punished responding, and a larger and longer lasting reduction in punished rates on withdrawal. In conclusion, the procedure detected anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of drugs, and the sedative side effects, development of tolerance, and rebound-anxiety on discontinuation of a benzodiazepine. This procedure should have utility in the characterization of novel treatments of anxiety.", 
    "48": "Medical literature provides only scarce data about the degree of pain experienced by patients undergoing a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMAB), and little is known about the factors that can modify the perception of pain. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a combination of analgesia and anxiolysis in reducing the pain score of patients undergoing BMAB.", 
    "49": "Eighty-four consecutive adult patients underwent BMAB after local anesthesia with 5 mL of lidocaine hydrochloride 1% aqueous solution in the left posterior superior iliac crest. Analgesia was obtained with acetaminophen 650 mg and oxycodone 10 mg, and anxiolysis was obtained with lorazepam 2 mg, all drugs given once orally 30 min before the procedure. We assessed the pain level with the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, which distinguishes six levels of pain, from 0 to 5.", 
    "50": "The 34 patients who received an oral administration of analgesia and anxiolysis reported pain at lower levels, i.e., in the range of 0-2, more frequently than the 50 patients who underwent BMAB without analgesia/anxiolysis (78% vs 64%, respectively). Among several predictors analyzed using a multivariate regression model, three were found to be associated with decreased pain level: the use of analgesia/anxiolysis, male sex, and increase in age (all with p values <0.05). Length of the extracted bone specimen, body mass index, and need of a spinal needle for anesthesia in obese patients did not predict for pain level.", 
    "51": "An oral administration of prophylactic regimen of analgesia and anxiolysis, at the above-mentioned doses, produced a statistically significant reduction of the perception of pain in patients undergoing BMAB, but its effect did not seem to provide a major and clinically significant reduction of pain level.", 
    "52": "Genetically engineered mouse models of human cardiovascular disease provide an opportunity to understand critical pathophysiological mechanisms. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) provides precise reproducible assessment of cardiac structure and function, but, in contrast to echocardiography, requires that the animal be immobilized during image acquisition. General anesthetic regimens yield satisfactory images, but have the potential to significantly perturb cardiac function. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of general anesthesia and a new deep sedation regimen, respectively, on cardiac function in mice as determined by CMR, and to compare them to results obtained in mildly sedated conscious mice by echocardiography.", 
    "53": "In 6 mildly sedated normal conscious mice assessed by echo, heart rate was 615 +/- 25 min-1 (mean +/- SE) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.94 +/- 0.01. In the CMR studies of normal mice, heart rate was slightly lower during deep sedation with morphine/midazolam (583 +/- 30 min-1), but the difference was not statistically significant. General anesthesia with 1% inhaled isoflurane significantly depressed heart rate (468 +/- 7 min-1, p < 0.05 vs. conscious sedation). In 6 additional mice with ischemic LV failure, trends in heart rate were similar, but not statistically significant. In normal mice, deep sedation depressed LVEF (0.79 +/- 0.04, p < 0.05 compared to light sedation), but to a significantly lesser extent than general anesthesia (0.60 +/- 0.04, p < 0.05 vs. deep sedation). In mice with ischemic LV failure, ejection fraction measurements were comparable when performed during light sedation, deep sedation, and general anesthesia, respectively. Contrast-to-noise ratios were similar during deep sedation and during general anesthesia, indicating comparable image quality. Left ventricular mass measurements made by CMR during deep sedation were nearly identical to those made during general anesthesia (r2 = 0.99, mean absolute difference < 4%), indicating equivalent quantitative accuracy obtained with the two methods. The imaging procedures were well-tolerated in all mice.", 
    "54": "In mice with normal cardiac function, CMR during deep sedation causes significantly less depression of heart rate and ejection fraction than imaging during general anesthesia with isoflurane. In mice with heart failure, the sedation/anesthesia regimen had no clear impact on cardiac function. Deep sedation and general anesthesia produced CMR with comparable image quality and quantitative accuracy.",

    "59": "The anxiolytic activity and adverse benzodiazepine-like effects of a bovine alpha s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate (CH) were evaluated. The effects of CH orally administered at doses of 5 and 15 mg/kg were compared with those of diazepam (DZ) at 3 mg/kg in the conditioned defensive burying test. Rats treated either with CH at 15 mg/kg or with DZ showed a decrease in anxiety. A drug-related difference was observed in terms of duration, as the anxiolytic-like action of CH was maintained after 7 days with twice-daily administration, whereas that of DZ was not. CH and DZ were then evaluated for their potential effects on memory in a passive avoidance paradigm. CH-treated rats had significantly longer latencies before entering the dark compartment where they were previously delivered a shock, indicating better retention relative to DZ-treated rats. In the final test, CH and DZ were evaluated for place preference, an index of the possible addictive potential of these substances. DZ-treated rats spent more time in the compartment associated with drug exposure than control rats. This effect was not found in CH-treated rats. Thus, CH did not display side effects associated with DZ, despite its affinity for gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors. Specific linking of CH on GABA(A) receptor function involved in anxiolysis, but not on that implied in memory-impairing effects, may be hypothesized to explain its specific activity. This profile might render it advantageous for nutritional purposes.",

    "61": "A detailed electronic survey containing comprehensive questions regarding epilepsy in AS was conducted through the Angelman Syndrome Foundation.", 
    "62": "There were responses from 461 family members of individuals with AS, of whom 86% had epilepsy (60% with multiple seizure types), the most common being atonic, generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and complex partial. Partial-onset seizures only were reported in 11% of those with epilepsy. Epilepsy was most common among those with maternal deletions and unknown subtypes, with catastrophic epilepsies present in only these two subtypes. These epilepsies were refractory to medication, with only 15% responding to the first antiepileptic drug (AED). The most commonly prescribed AED were valproic acid and clonazepam, but lamotrigine and levetiracetam appeared to have similar efficacy and tolerability.", 
    "63": "This is the largest study to date assessing epilepsy in AS. Although epilepsy in AS is considered a generalized epilepsy, there was a high prevalence of partial seizures. There are few previous data regarding the use of newer AED in AS, and the results of this study suggest that these newer agents, specifically levetiracetam and lamotrigine, may have efficacy similar to that of valproic acid and clonazepam, and that they appear to have similar or better side-effect profiles. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as dietary therapy and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) also suggest favorable efficacy and tolerability, although further studies are needed.", 
    "64": "A 52-year-old geriatric nurse presented with recurrent eczema localized in uncovered skin areas. Patch testing produced an eczematous skin reaction with type IV sensitization totetrazepam. A relapse of contact dermatitis was successfully prevented by using occupational skin protection measures and organizational measures.Our case indicates that a sensitization to drugs should be considered when allergic contact dermatitisis suspected in nursing personnel.", 
    "65": "Drugs used in anaesthesia may provoke torsadogenic changes in cardiac repolarisation. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of promethazine on the parameters of ventricular repolarisation: QTc interval and transmural dispersion of repolarisation. Forty patients were randomly allocated to receive promethazine (25 mg) or midazolam (2.5 mg). Changes in the ECG and arterial blood pressure were recorded. Correction of QT interval was calculated using Bazett's formula and Fridericia's correction; transmural dispersion of repolarisation was determined as T(peak)-T(end) time. Significant prolongation of QT interval, corrected with both formulae, was detected in patients receiving promethazine, while no change in the QTc value was observed in the midazolam group. There were no significant differences in T(peak)-T(end) time either between or within the groups. In conclusion, promethazine induces significant QTc prolongation but the lack of influence on transmural dispersion of repolarisation makes the risk of its torsadogenic action very low.", 
    "66": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can result from a traumatic experience that elicits emotions of fear, helpless or horror. Most individuals remain asymptomatic or symptoms quickly resolve, but in a minority intrusive imagery and nightmares, emotional numbing and avoidance, and hyperarousal persist for decades. PTSD is associated with psychiatric and medical co-morbidities, increased risk for suicide, and with poor social and occupational functioning. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are common treatments. Whereas, research supports the efficacy of the cognitive behavioral psychotherapies, there is insufficient evidence to unequivocally support the efficacy of any specific pharmacotherapy. Proven effective pharmacologic agents are sorely needed to treat core and targeted PTSD symptoms, and for prevention. This review describes current and emerging pharmacotherapies that advance these goals.", 
    "67": "Recidivism is a major problem in the prevention of DUI offenses. It is suggested that impairing substances used by drivers may relate to a higher risk of recidivism. This study aims to determine rearrest rates in different groups of arrested drivers focusing on different substances found in the blood.", 
    "68": "The data utilized were obtained from the register of suspected DUI offenders maintained by the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). Data were available for the 15-year period between 1993 and 2007. The number of rearrests was traced from the individuals' ID codes. The mean blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of the DUI offenders was studied as well as their age at the time of the first arrest. Rearrest rates according to alcohol and drug findings were estimated using survival analysis methods.", 
    "69": "At the time of the first arrest, the drivers with a single DUI arrest were older and had a lower BAC than those who had a later arrest. The proportion of female drivers decreased as the number of rearrests increased. Drivers with drugs only or a combination of drugs and alcohol had a significantly higher rearrest rate than drivers with alcohol alone. Drivers with amphetamines only had the highest rearrest rates. Findings of benzodiazepine and opioids alone did not increase the risk of rearrest in the long run. Young age, male sex, high blood alcohol level, and arrest during the nighttime and during weekdays constituted a higher risk for rearrest.", 
    "70": "A third of those suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs are rearrested within 15 years. Drugs, especially amphetamines, are a risk factor for faster rearrest. These results show that the groups at risk of recidivism can be pinpointed. Interventions to prevent recidivism should be developed particularly for drugged drivers. Substance abuse beginning in adolescence seems to be a greater risk.", 
    "71": "In light of the differential interactions seen between benzodiazepine, GABA transporter (GAT) inhibition and drug tolerance, the locomotor effects of a GAT1-specific inhibitor (SKF89976A) following diazepam tolerance were analysed and compared with the concomitant expression of synaptic vesicle proteins implicated in synaptic plasticity.", 
    "72": "Male PVG/OlaHsd rats were chronically dosed with diazepam to produce tolerance, and the expression of mRNA for synaptophysin and synaptotagmin were analysed in the hippocampus by means of in situ hybridisation. The action of the GAT inhibitor SKF89976A on the expression of these mRNAs, and on open field behaviour was subsequently observed.", 
    "73": "The results show an unexpected sedative effect of GAT-inhibition in diazepam-tolerant rats. The expression data show a significant effect of diazepam treatment on synaptophysin expression, which is reversible by SKF89976A treatment.", 
    "74": "The increased synaptophysin expression in the hippocampus of diazepam-tolerant rats may indicate a role for modulation of transmitter release, synaptic plasticity and learning in pharmacological tolerance. The reversibility of this effect following acute GAT inhibition suggests a complicated relationship between the benzodiazepine-binding site and other synaptic GABA-binding sites. Furthermore, the sedative behavioural effect of the GAT inhibitor in diazepam-tolerant rats is an unusual observation with implications for the treatment of drug-tolerant individuals.", 
    "75": "Ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors is a complex process that involves sequential receptor conformational changes, ligand translocation, and possibly ligand-induced receptor oligomerization. Binding events at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are usually interpreted from radioligand binding studies in terms of two-step ligand-induced receptor isomerization. We report here, using a combination of fluorescence approaches, on the molecular mechanisms for Bodipy-pirenzepine binding to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-fused muscarinic M1 receptors in living cells. Real time monitoring, under steady-state conditions, of the strong fluorescence energy transfer signal elicited by this interaction permitted a fine kinetic description of the binding process. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements allowed us to identify discrete EGFP lifetime species and to follow their redistribution upon ligand binding. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, with EGFP brightness analysis, showed that EGFP-fused muscarinic M1 receptors predominate as monomers in the absence of ligand and dimerize upon pirenzepine binding. Finally, all these experimental data could be quantitatively reconciled into a three-step mechanism, with four identified receptor conformational states. Fast ligand binding to a peripheral receptor site initiates a sequence of conformational changes that allows the ligand to access to inner regions of the protein and drives ligand-receptor complexes toward a high affinity dimeric state.", 
    "76": "Normally, mice sleep during the day and are active at night. In Huntington's disease mice (R6/2 line) this circadian pattern disintegrates progressively over the course of their illness. Cognitive decline and apathy in R6/2 mice can be improved with sleeping drugs, suggesting that sleep disruption contributes to their neurological decline. We wondered if wakefulness was equally important. Here, we used two drugs to manage sleep/wake cycles in R6/2 mice, Alprazolam (to put them to sleep) and Modafinil (to wake them up). We found that both drugs improved cognitive function and apathy, but had a stronger effect when used in combination. Remarkably, beneficial effects on cognitive performance were also seen in vehicle-treated cage-mates of Alprazolam/Modafinil-treated mice, suggesting that behavioral intervention to regularize sleep/wake activity might be therapeutically useful. We suggest that focused management of sleep and wakefulness will slow the progression of cognitive decline and apathy in neurological conditions where sleep is disordered.", 
    "77": "In order for a drug to act it must be present at the correct concentration in its sites of action... but also at the right time. It is now clearly established that the body which receives a drug is made up of a set of biological rhythms and that the effects, toxicity and kinetics of the drug depend on the time when it is administered, the concept of chronopharmacology. As in other areas, the activity and safety of drugs used for psychiatric treatment depend on their time of administration : chronopharmacological studies have, for example, shown the effects of some antidepressants (imipramine, chlorimipramine, clorgyline etc) on the rhythm period in animals. Variability associated with the time when psychotropic drugs such as the anti-psychotics, stimulates antidepressants and benzodiazepines for example are given has also been demonstrated. These chronopharmacological effects can be explained by temporal variations in the mechanism of action of the drug on receptors, or of its fate in the body (chronokinetics). Application of these concepts to the treatment of psychiatric diseases, many of which are associated with dysfunction of the biological clocks, has led to chronotherapeutic studies on, for example, clomipramine, haloperidol and imipramine intended to define a better dosing time for efficacy and/or safety.", 
    "78": "Most children with paediatric neurotransmitter diseases have global functional deficits secondary to central nervous system damage. Paediatric physiatrists, working in conjunction with a multi-disciplinary team, help to improve physical function by normalizing muscle tone and improving body position. Components of spasticity, rigidity, and dystonia may all need to be considered in a comprehensive treatment programme. Complications of disordered tone include skin breakdown, pain, sleep disturbance, and dysphagia. With an integrated approach to use of medications and equipment as well as implementation of therapy and therapeutic exercise, physiatrists can help maximize functional independence for children with this group of disorders. Pharmacological treatment includes GABA-agonists including baclofen and benzodiazepines, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, L: -dopa and dopaminergic agents, and dantrolene. Intrathecal baclofen may be used in patients refractory to these medications. In addition, physicians may utilize botulinum toxin, phenol, or surgical interventions such as selective dorsal rhizotomy or tendon lengthening. Pharmacological treatment must be used in conjunction with appropriate adaptive equipment in order to maximize therapeutic benefit. Focus on function in an attempt to increase independence is targeted to improve the child's quality of life. We present a framework and rationale to the management of the functional consequences of the paediatric neurotransmitter diseases.", 
    "79": "Management of spasticity is a major challenge to the rehabilitation team. The initial management has centered on the elimination of externally exacerbating causes, physical therapy, splinting and casting. Medical management has centered on anti-spasticity medication use, but more recently focal treatment methods including phenol blocks and botulinum toxin have been utilized. There has been an increased use of intrathecal baclofen in the management of refractory tone. Dorsal rhizotomy has been advocated for a selective population of children with spasticity. There is no standardized approach to spasticity management and this paper will discuss the importance of evidence-based treatment of spasticity that is adapted for the individual child.", 
    "80": "Premedication with midazolam is commonly used in children to reduce anxiety and improve cooperation before anesthesia. However, it has the potential to alter respiratory function because of its muscle relaxant properties. We assessed functional residual capacity (FRC), ventilation homogeneity, using a lung clearance index (LCI), and respiratory mechanics in children awake and 20 min after oral premedication with midazolam (0.3 mg/kg).", 
    "81": "FRC and LCI were measured using a SF(6) multibreath washout technique while respiratory resistance and elastance were extracted from the input impedance obtained by forced oscillation technique in 18 children (3-8 yr) before and after oral premedication with midazolam.", 
    "82": "Premedication led to a small (6.5%) but statistically significant decrease in group mean FRC from 25.0 (SD 1.4) to 23.4 (1.9) mL/kg and an associated increase in LCI by 7.8% from 6.4 (0.4) to 6.9 (0.4), indicating increased ventilation inhomogeneities. Furthermore, midazolam resulted in a statistically significant increase in respiratory resistance by 7.4% from 3.38 (0.6) to 3.62 (0.6) cm H(2)O s/L (P < 0.001) and in respiratory elastance by 9.2% from 48.8 to 52.9 cm H(2)O s/L (P < 0.001). The changes in FRC, LCI, resistance and elastance were significantly correlated (P < 0.001).", 
    "83": "In children with normal lungs, premedication with a relatively small-dose of midazolam led to mild changes in respiratory variables shortly after its administration. However, the anesthesiologist should be aware that using midazolam in children at high risk of respiratory complications under anesthesia might lead to a greater decrease in respiratory function.", 
    "84": "The aim of this study was to determine binding affinities of the Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) with protoporphyrin IX, haematoporphyrin (Hp), and two arginized derivatives: Hp(Arg)(2) and PP(Arg)(2). The quenching of protein fluorescence was used to measure association constants during titration of PBR solution with PP derivatives in a function of concentration. The experimental data was fitted to theoretical curves, assuming strong and weak binding model with one binding site. As a result of this early study affinity constants were determined. The highest affinity toward PBR showed PPIX and Hp, Hp(Arg)(2), PP(Arg)(2) lower, respectively. Changes in pH of protein solution resulted in decrease of association constants in nearly all examined derivatives.", 
    "85": "Nitrobenzodiazepine (NBDZ) is a sedative-hypnotic drug used in the treatment of anxiety and sleep problems. Overdose of NBDZ may cause severe neurological effects, especially for people in drug abuse or addiction. In the present study, we investigated NBDZ nitroreduction in rat enteric contents and characterized the role of enterobacterial nitroreductase in the reductive pathway. Nitroreduction of flunitrazepam (FZ) was studied in the microsomal membrane fractions of rat liver, jejunum and jejunal microflora using HPLC analysis. In the jejunal microflora, FZ was demonstrated to be significantly reduced to its amino derivative under anaerobic condition. Escherichia coli type I nitroreductase NfsB (EC 1.5.1.34) was found in rat jejunal microflora via PCR technique and Western blotting. The participation of NfsB in FZ nitroreduction was demonstrated from inhibition studies. Kinetic study of the purified recombinant NfsB indicated that nitroreduction of FZ, nitrazepam (NZ) and clonazepam (CZ) are mediated by NfsB, where CZ shows lower k(cat)/K(M) ratio than that of the other two. Finally, two other nitroreductases E. cloacae NR (EC 1.6.99.7) and S. typhimurium Cnr were also found to be responsible for FZ nitroreduction. These results provide that the reduction of NBDZ in normal flora is catalyzed by type I nitroreductase NfsB.", 
    "86": "Few investigations have examined sleep in cervical dystonia (CD) patients. We assessed 43 consecutive CD patients, 19 patients with other focal movement disorders, and 49 healthy, age- and gender-matched controls for the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness (as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS). All patients were receiving botulinum toxin. We found that a higher percentage of CD patients had abnormal ESS scores of >11 than did either of the two control groups (21% vs. 0% vs. 4%, p < 0.05 for each pairwise comparison with the CD group). Use of anticholinergic medications accounted for some but not all of this increase in sleepiness in the CD group. Age, gender, race, scores on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) or its subscores (severity, disability, and pain), and other common medication use (benzodiazepines, antidepressants) were not associated with increased ESS scores. This preliminary finding of excessive daytime sleepiness in a substantial portion of CD patients suggests that further investigation into disordered sleep in CD is warranted.", 
    "87": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are GABA(A) receptor modulators with anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant properties. BDZs are understood to potentiate GABA(A) receptor function by increasing channel opening frequency, in contrast to barbiturates, which increase channel open duration. However, the in vitro evidence demonstrating increased opening frequency involved prolonged exposure to sub-saturating GABA concentrations, conditions most similar to those found in extrasynaptic areas. In contrast, synaptic GABA(A) receptors are transiently activated by high GABA concentrations. To determine if BDZ modulation of single-channel opening frequency would be different for BDZ-sensitive receptors activated under synaptic versus extrasynaptic conditions, a combination of patch clamp recording and kinetic modeling was used. Consistent with the original experimental findings, BDZs were found to increase receptor affinity for GABA by decreasing the unbinding rate. While this mechanism was predicted to increase opening frequency under extrasynaptic conditions, simulations predicted that the same mechanism under synaptic conditions would increase the number, but not the frequency, of single-channel openings. Thus, a single mechanism (slower GABA unbinding) can produce differential changes in opening frequency under synaptic versus extrasynaptic conditions. The functional impact of BDZs on GABA(A) receptors therefore depends upon the physiological context of receptor activation.", 
    "88": "The recreational drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) has euphoric effects and can induce sedation and body temperature changes. GHB is frequently combined with other recreational drugs although these interactions are not well characterised. The present study used biotelemetry to provide a fine-grained analysis of the effects of GHB on body temperature and locomotor activity in freely moving rats, and investigated interactions between GHB and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methamphetamine (METH) and various antagonist drugs. GHB (1000mg/kg) caused profound sedation for more than 2h and a complex triphasic effect on body temperature: an initial hypothermia (5-40min), followed by hyperthermia (40-140min), followed again by hypothermia (140-360min). A lower GHB dose (500mg/kg) also caused sedation but only a hypothermic effect that lasted up to 6h. The dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (1mg/kg), the opioid antagonist naltrexone (1mg/kg), the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (10mg/kg), and the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist ritanserin (1mg/kg) did not prevent the overall sedative or body temperature effects of GHB (1000mg/kg). However the GABA(B) antagonist SCH 50911 (50mg/kg) prevented the hyperthermia induced by GHB (1000mg/kg). Repeated daily administration of GHB (1000mg/kg) produced tolerance to the sedative and hyperthermic effects of the drug and cross-tolerance to the sedative effects of the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (10mg/kg). A high ambient temperature of 28 degrees C prevented the hypothermia obtained with GHB (500mg/kg) at 20 degrees C, while GHB (500mg/kg) reduced the hyperthermia and hyperactivity produced by co-administered doses of MDMA (5mg/kg) or METH (1mg/kg) at 28 degrees C. These results further confirm a role for GABA(B) receptors in the hypothermic and sedative effects of GHB and show an interaction between GHB and MDMA, and GHB and METH, that may be relevant to the experience of recreational users who mix these drugs.", 
    "89": "Possible central nervous system effects of the gymnosperm lectin from Araucaria angustifolia seeds were studied in seizure and open field tests. Male Swiss mice were administered saline (control), lectin (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg), flumazenil (1 mg/kg), or diazepam (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Lectin at the highest dose increased time to death in the pentylenetetrazole- and strychnine-induced seizure models as compared with control, but not in the pilocarpine model. In the open field test, lectin reduced locomotor activity at all doses tested, as did diazepam, when compared with control. These locomotor effects were reversed by flumazenil pretreatment. In conclusion, A. angustifolia lectin had a protective effect in the pentylenetetrazole- and strychnine-induced seizure models, suggestive of activity in the GABAergic and glycinergic systems, respectively, and also caused a reduction in animal movements, which was reversed by flumazenil, pointing to a depressant action mediated by a GABAergic mechanism.",

What are the effects of treatments for nausea and vomiting occurring either as a result of the disease or its treatment, in adults with chronic diseases other than cancer? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

    "95": "Ninety-three percent of women with FM reported taking at least one medication (1855 total, 499 types, on average 4.6 per person) compared with 56% of women without FM (269 total, 172 types, 1.4 per person on average). Half (n = 217) of the women with FM reported taking antidepressant drugs; more reported selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)-type with moderate effectiveness than tricyclic amines deemed to have strong effectiveness. Few were taking dual uptake inhibitors or the now approved pregabalin. Nearly 30% reported taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), which have weak efficacy evidence. Less than 8% of controls reported taking either antidepressants or NSAID. Having FM was associated with these medications plus guaifenesen, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, narcotics, other analgesics, and benzodiazepines. Highest effectiveness scores were for opioid narcotics and guaifenesin. Forty-three percent of women with FM reported taking at least one herb/supplement compared with 23% of control women. The most common types were omega esterified fatty acids, glucosamine, and gingko. No particular type distinguished between the groups. Both groups tended to rate overall effectiveness lower for herbs/supplements than for conventional medications.", 
    "96": "Substantial numbers of women with FM were taking pain medications that often lacked evidence for effectiveness. The variety of medications being taken by women with FM compared with women without FM indicates that there are few medications that consistently provide symptom alleviation for this condition.", 
    "97": "A significant number of head-injured trauma patients are likely to present with a positive toxicology. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether intoxication with substances such as cocaine, amphetamine, alcohol, and opiates on admission has any influence on the number of organs that are recovered after brain death in these patients. We conducted a retrospective review of all organ donor patients admitted to a Level I trauma center over a 4-year period (2002 to 2005). Patients with positive toxicology screens on admission were compared to counterparts with negative screens with regard to the number of organs harvested. There were 90 organ donor patients during the 4-year period. There were 63 (70%) patients to negative toxicology screens. The remaining 27 (30%) were found to be intoxicated with a variety of substances, including alcohol (18%), cocaine (4%), amphetamines (9%), benzodiazepines (4%), opiates (4%), and polysubstances (10%). A comparison of total organs and individual organs donated by both intoxicated and nonintoxicated patients showed no overall statistical difference in the number or type of organs donated between the two groups. Thus, the prospect of organ procurement should not be overlooked in intoxicated patients.",

Moreover, elderly people are more sensitive to frequently used drugs like NSAIDs, benzodiazepines, opioids, etc. There is an urgent need to develop better preventive strategies to reduce the burden of adverse drug reactions.", 
    "99": "Aim of the study was to investigate polypharmacy and psychotropic drugs as risk factors for falls in a Long-term Care Setting for elderly patients. In a cross-sectional study we investigated the characteristics of 414 subjects: 207 fallen patients 44 (21.3%) male e 163 (78.7%) female mean age 84.16 +/- 8.3 y.o. First generation neuroleptics (OR 1.739 CI 95% 1.047-2.889), benzodiazepines (OR 2.357 CI 95% 1.5-3.702) and mood stabilizers (OR 1.889 CI 95% 1.091-3.270) were associated to falls when adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities.

    "100": "Antipsychotic agents are widely used for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with several brain disorders. Antipsychotic drugs principally affect dopamine systems with the newer ones also affecting serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine systems. Other transmitter systems can be involved with selected antipsychotic drugs but effects on cholinergic system are less known. Considerable evidence has shown that complex interactions between dopaminergic and cholinergic systems are critical for the proper regulation of motor control and memory. These neurotransmitter systems have been studied in zebrafish, which has recently become a focus of neurobehavioral studies. Therefore, we have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effects of sulpiride, olanzapine, and haloperidol on acetylcholinesterase activity and ache expression pattern in zebrafish brain. For in vitro studies, all drugs were able to promote a decrease on acetylcholinesterase activity. For in vivo studies, olanzapine and sulpiride exposure did not change acetylcholinesterase activity. In contrast, this enzyme activity was significantly increased at 5 and 9 microM haloperidol (29.9% and 20.4%, respectively). Haloperidol exposure was able to increase acetylcholinesterase mRNA transcripts. These findings have suggested that the alterations in zebrafish acetylcholinesterase could reveal molecular mechanisms related to cholinergic signaling induced by antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "101": "Intrathecal administration of serotonin (5-HT) is antinociceptive through the involvement of spinal cord gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Therefore, 5-HT would interact with the GABA agonist, midazolam, which is well known to exert spinally mediated antinociception in the spinal cord. The present study investigated the antinociceptive interaction between spinally administered 5-HT and midazolam, using two different rat nociceptive models.", 
    "102": "Sprague-Dawley rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were tested for their thermal tail withdrawal response and paw flinches induced by formalin injection after the intrathecal administration of midazolam or 5-HT, or the midazolam/ HT combination. The effects of the combination were tested by isobolographic analysis, using the combination of each 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 of the 50% effective dose (ED50). The total fractional dose was calculated. Behavioral side effects were also examined.", 
    "103": "5-HT alone and midazolam alone both showed dose-dependent antinociception in both the tail flick test and the formalin test. The ED50 of the combination was not different from the calculated additive value either in the tail flick test or in phase 2 of the formalin test, but it was significantly smaller than the calculated additive value in phase 1 of the formalin test. The total fractional dose value was 0.90 in the tail flick test, 0.093 in phase 1 of the formalin test, and 1.38 in phase 2 of the formalin test. The agitation, allodynia, or motor disturbance observed with either agent alone was not seen with the combination treatment.",

    "105": "In this study, we compared the effects of five short-, medium-, or long-acting benzodiazepine-receptor agonists (BZDs) [alprazolam (APZ), clonazepam (CLZ), flunitrazepam (FLZ), loprazolam (LPZ), zolpidem (ZLP)], at two distinct doses, 0.2 and 2 mg/kg, on the cell surface regulation of mu-opioid receptor induced by 0.15 mg/kg buprenorphine (BPN) in specific regions of the rat brain. Using 0.312 - 5 nM [(3)H]-DAMGO concentrations and Scatchard plot analysis, B(max) (maximal receptor density) and K(d) (dissociation constant) were determined at different brain regions of interest (amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus). Acute BPN induced an expected down-regulation and addition of each of the BZDs to BPN induced less down-regulation than did BPN alone, sometimes while altering affinity. Some significant differences in the intensity of these effects were observed between BZDs. FLZ that is widely abused and enlarges BPN toxicity appeared the most potent to increase mu-cell surface receptor density at the lowest dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Besides, LPZ for which the effect on mu-opioid-receptor regulation appeared lower is considered to have a low risk of dependence in the epidemiological data banks. CLZ and ZLP (2 mg/kg) induced the strongest modification on mu-opioid-receptor density, but a substantial decrease in affinity could minimize the functional consequences. The reported changes were maximal in the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus. Among people using BPN and BZDs, the effects described here are likely to influence addictive behaviors and induce toxic effects that could be quantitatively different due to the quality of the BZD.", 
    "106": "In this study, we questioned whether propofol provided clinical benefits compared with midazolam in terms of neuropsychometric recovery, safety profile and patient tolerance. Patients, aged >18 yrs, were randomised to receive midazolam or propofol, given by non-anaesthetist physicians to achieve moderate levels of sedation as assessed by the electroencephalographic bispectral index (BIS; between 70 and 85). The primary end-point was the time delay until recovery of the BIS above 90. Other end-points included a neuropsychometric continuous performance test (CPT), serious respiratory adverse events, patient tolerance and physician satisfaction. Neuropsychometric recovery was improved in the propofol compared to the midazolam group as evidenced by faster normalisation of BIS index (5.4+/-4.7 min versus 11.7+/-10.2 min; p = 0.001) and better results at the CPT. In the midazolam group, 15% of patients presented profound sedation precluding CPT completion and one patient required mechanical ventilatory support. Patient tolerance was significantly better in the propofol group, whereas the operator's assessment was comparable in both groups. Compared with midazolam, propofol provided a higher quality of sedation in terms of neuropsychometric recovery and patient tolerance. BIS-guided propofol administration represents a safe sedation technique that can be performed by the non-anaesthesiologist.", 
    "107": "We have previously shown the neuroprotective effect of atypical antipsychotic agents by experimental cerebral ischemia. However the impact of their high dose related side effects on their low dosage related neuroprotectivity is still unknown.We evaluated the possible neuroprotective effects of high dose olanzapine (10mg/kg) treatment on ischemic brain injury 24 hr after permanent cerebral ischemia. Olanzapine showed neither a neuroprotective nor a neurotoxic effect after focal cerebral ischemia. This finding could suggest that dose related side effect of olanzapine could involve a restriction of its neuroprotective effect unlike lower doses that have been reported to have neuroprotective effect.", 
    "108": "Clinical investigation of a transdermal phenazepam preparation (phenapercuten) in patients diagnosed with different anxiety disorders revealed an original therapeutic action of the new drug, which included both a selective anxiolytic effect and an activating (antiasthenic) component in the absence of undesired sedative and miorelaxant properties. It is shown that the specific action of phenapercuten is related to features of the pharmacokinetic profile of this transdermal drug that is characterized by a low levels of active compound in the blood plasma and by the absence of peak concentrations. TTS Phenapercuten was most effective in patients with anxiety disorders of simple structure.",

The interviews were followed by a questionnaire consisting of 52 questions relating to the principles of treatment and a perception of the features of antipsychotics. One part of the interview focused on refractory schizophrenia treatment. The perception of antipsychotics was interpreted with the use of the Pin Points Analysis method.", 
    "111": "In-patient schizophrenic patients are treated most often with clozapine (57%), but olanzapine (38%) and risperidone (32%) are the most common in out-patients. Other neuroleptics are prescribed considerably seldom. According to the doctors' declaration, their choices of medicines would be different, if there were no external limitations in drug prescription. In spite of this, the psychiatrists' claim, that their choice of antipsychotics is based on their own knowledge (44%), to a smaller degree it is based on the experts' recommendations (32%) and the currently valid reimbursement rules (24%).", 
    "112": "The Refractory schizophrenia treatment that is applied in practice, is generally convergent with the principles of the treatment. Clozapine still has a significant place in therapy. Use of all the remaining atypicals, besides risperidone and the olanzapine, they are limited by the high price for patient.",

    "115": "The most frequently prescribed drug was olanzapine (33%), then risperidone (26%), and perazine (25%). In hospitals, risperidone was more frequently administered than perazine (29% and 24% respectively) while in out-patient clinics perazine slightly outnumbered risperidone (25% vs 23%). Fluoxetine was prescribed to 18% of out-patients, but not to hospitalized ones. Doctors performed treatment verification mainly (in 39% of patients) after 4 weeks of therapy. The change of antipsychotics was made more frequently in 28% of those hospitalized than the out-patients (16%) and mainly due to the lack of efficacy. More psychiatrists considered the most important attribute of the drug to be the efficacy toward the negative symptoms (77%) than the positive symptoms (59% of doctors).", 
    "116": "Prescription practice of psychiatrists shows the popularity of olanzapine and risperidone in the treatment of the first psychotic episode, but also indicates the strong position of perazine, which results from the current administrative regulations. Three times more psychiatrists think that patients should have an unrestricted (by the law) access to olanzapine or risperidone than to perazine. The most important attribute of an antipsychotic in the first episode schizophrenia turned out to be its efficacy toward the negative symptoms. Psychiatrists admitted that they chose an antipsychotic much more frequently on the basis of their own knowledge than on the basis of experts' opinion or the administrative regulations.", 
    "117": "There is an increasing interest in the health risks related to the use of herbal remedies. Although most consumers think that phytomedicines are safe and without side effects, interactions between complementary alternative and conventional medicines are being described. The aim of this clinical case report is to highlight the importance of the safe use of herbal remedies by providing a clinical interaction study between pharmaceutical medicines and herbal medicinal products. The case of a patient self-medicated with Valeriana officinalis L. and Passiflora incarnata L. while he was on lorazepam treatment is described. Handshaking, dizziness, throbbing and muscular fatigue were reported within the 32 h before clinical diagnosis. The analysis of family medical history ruled out essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Wilson's disease and other symptom-related pathologies. His medical history revealed a generalized anxiety disorder and medicinal plant consumption but no neurological disorder. Appropriate physical examination was carried out. An additive or synergistic effect is suspected to have produced these symptoms. The active principles of Valerian and passionflower might increase the inhibitory activity of benzodiazepines binding to the GABA receptors, causing severe secondary effects. Due to the increase in herbal product self-medication, the use of herbal remedies should be registered while taking the personal clinical history. Multidisciplinary teams should be created to raise studies on medicinal plants with impact on medical praxis.",

We compared the safety and efficacy of NAPS using PCA pumps with diazemuls-pethidine sedation (DPS) for outpatient colonoscopy.", 
    "120": "In a prospective randomized controlled trial patients underwent outpatient colonoscopy with sedation by either NAPS or DPS. For NAPS, following intravenous loading of 0.8 mg/kg propofol, mixtures of 14.3 mg propofol and 35 microgram alfentanil were titrated by nurses using a PCA pump. For DPS, 0.1 mg/kg diazemuls and 0.5 mg/kg pethidine were given as intravenous bolus; further titration was administered as half doses at the endoscopist's discretion.

With NAPS, levels of sedation both during colonoscopic intubation and at reaching the cecum were significantly deeper than with DPS (OSSA 3 vs. 5, P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in cardiopulmonary complication rates, pain scores, satisfaction scores, and patients' willingness to repeat colonoscopy with the same sedation. Drugs cost for NAPS was higher than for DPS (Hong Kong dollars [HKD] 98.34 vs. 5.01).",

    "123": "Objectives of the study were to evaluate the relationship between olanzapine plasma concentrations and efficacy, prolactin, and weight and to assess effects of smoking, sex, and race on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of oral olanzapine up to 40 mg/d. Patients were randomly allocated to olanzapine 10, 20, or 40 mg/d for 8 weeks. Olanzapine concentrations in 634 samples from 380 patients were analyzed. Mean sample collection time was approximately 15 hours after dose for all groups. Mean olanzapine concentrations were 19.7 +/- 11.4, 37.9 +/- 22.8, and 74.5 +/- 43.7 ng/mL for 10-, 20-, and 40-mg doses, respectively. Olanzapine concentration and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale improvement were not significantly correlated. Change in both weight and prolactin showed significant dose response. Prolactin concentration was correlated with olanzapine concentration (r = 0.46, P < 0.001). No significant correlation between olanzapine concentration and weight change was observed. Olanzapine concentrations were lower in self-reported smokers (16.5 +/- 9.6, 34.2 +/- 20.8, and 60.9 +/- 34.6 ng/mL) than in self-reported nonsmokers (25.6 +/- 12.3, 43.4 +/- 24.7, and 113.2 +/- 44.0 ng/mL) for 10-, 20-, and 40-mg doses, respectively (P </= 0.022). In the 40-mg group only, African Americans had a lower mean olanzapine concentration than whites (65.6 +/- 44.1 and 84.8 +/- 44.1 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.048). Women had numerically but not significantly higher mean olanzapine concentrations than men. In conclusion, olanzapine pharmacokinetics of doses up to 40 mg/d was generally consistent with prior findings in studies with fewer subjects and/or lower doses.", 
    "124": "The objective of this study was to characterize the usefulness and reliability of a commonly used urinary on-site drugs of abuse screening test device when used routinely at admittances to a psychiatric emergency unit. Urine samples from 262 emergency psychiatric admittances representing 217 patients were analyzed by a commercially available on-site test for the detection of amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, and opiates in urine. The samples were first screened by nurses at the psychiatric department, thereafter by 2 technicians at the laboratory, and finally, analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results of 45.8% of the screening tests were true negative for all 5 drugs/drug groups tested, whereas those of 29.4% were true positive for 1 or several drugs/drug groups and true negative for the others. Thus, in total, 75.2% were correct for all 5 drugs/drug groups. In general, the sensitivities (42.9%-90.0% for the various drug groups) were lower than the specificities (92.7%-100.0%). The accuracies were 86.3% for benzodiazepines, 92.4% for cannabis, 94.7% for opiates, and 97.0% for amphetamines. No cocaine was found in any of the samples. For cannabis, the accuracy was higher among the laboratory technicians than among the nurses. The results from on-site screening testing should not be considered as the final conclusion on the intake of drugs of abuse but must be interpreted with caution.",

Body temperature was reduced at a rate of 2-3 degrees C/h by perfusing water at 10 degrees C though a U-shaped plastic tube positioned in the colon. Cooling continued until shivering was observed by an investigator blinded to treatment, or until core temperature reached 34 degrees C. Core temperatures were recorded from the distal esophagus, and core temperature at the onset of shivering defined the threshold. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Results are presented as means +/- SD; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Five of the six rabbits given JM-1232(-) at a rate of 0.01 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) shivered at 35.7 +/- 0.8 degrees C, and one of these rabbits failed to shiver at 34.0 degrees C. None of the rabbits given JM-1232(-) at a rate of 0.1 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) shivered before reaching the 34.0 degrees C cutoff temperature.", 
    "128": "A low dose of JM-1232(-) reduced the shivering threshold in rabbits approximately 0.8 degrees C which is similar to the effects in humans given premedication doses of midazolam. In contrast, a 10-fold larger dose reduced the threshold more than 2.5 degrees C. This is a substantial decrement and might facilitate induction of therapeutic hypothermia.",

Possible explanations for the low, variable and fluctuating EEG parameters are that volunteers were intermittently asleep, and that remifentanil gave rise to a low amplitude, slowed EEG pattern despite maintained consciousness. BIS and entropy values should be interpreted in combination with clinical findings in patients sedated with these agents.", 
    "130": "Exposure to ethanol during critical stages of brain development and maturation has adverse effects on behavioral and cognitive functions. So far, most animal models focused on the effects of either pre- or early postnatal ethanol treatment on behavior. We here used a multiple crossover design to investigate the effects of neonatal (postnatal day 7) ethanol treatment (2.5 g/kg b.i.d., dissolved in saline), subchronic peripubertal (postnatal days 40-65) ethanol treatment (1.0 g/kg, dissolved in saline) and the combination of both on the performance of adult Wistar rats in a variety of behavioral tasks. We also assessed anatomical changes in limbic and cortical brain areas. No effects of either single or combined neonatal and pubertal ethanol treatment was found on prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI, a measure of sensorimotor gating), or on the acoustic startle response in the absence of prepulses. Peripubertal ethanol treatment reduced the explorative behavior in the open field. The breakpoint in a progressive ratio operant response task was increased in those rats that had received both neonatal and pubertal ethanol treatment, while the preference for palatable food used as reinforcer in this task was not affected. No treatment effects were found on object recognition memory. No treatment effects on anxiety-related behavior in the elevated plus maze were found, however, the anxiolytic effect of the prototypical benzodiazepine diazepam was enhanced in rats that had received peripubertal ethanol treatment. Additive effects of neonatal and pubertal ethanol treatments were found on behaviors related to spontaneous locomotor activity. Combined neonatal and pubertal ethanol treatment lead to a reduction of myelin sheaths in the prefrontal cortex, and the neonatal ethanol treatment lead to a reduced number of parvalbumine-immunoreactive cells in the dorsal hippocampus. These findings suggest that neonatal ethanol exposure increases the risk of some but not all adverse behavioral and brain anatomical effects of pubertal ethanol consumption.", 
    "131": "Certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are commonly used to treat seizures in children also affect cognition, and these effects can persist into adulthood, long after drug withdrawal. Widespread enhancement of apoptosis may be one mechanism underlying these lasting cognitive changes. Whether AEDs affect other processes in brain development during early postnatal life has not, however, been systematically analyzed. Here we determined whether chronic administration of common AEDs during early life alters cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Postnatal day 7 (P7) rats received phenobarbital, clonazepam, carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or vehicle for 28 days. Bromodeoxyuridine was administered on P34 to label dividing cells. Cell proliferation was assessed 24 hr later, and cell survival and differentiation were assessed 28 days later. Phenobarbital and clonazepam significantly inhibited cell proliferation by 63% and 59%, respectively, and doublecortin immunoreactivity (indicator of neurogenesis) in the dorsal hippocampus was also significantly decreased by 26% and 24%, respectively. Survival of new cells steadily decreased in phenobarbital and clonazepam groups over 28 days. Reduced cell proliferation and survival resulted in fewer new neurons in the dentate gyrus, as confirmed by neuronal counting on P62. There were, however, no differences in cell distribution pattern or differentiation toward neuron and glial cells when phenobarbital and clonazepam groups were compared with controls. There were no changes in rats exposed to carbamazepine, valproate, or topiramate. Thus, inhibiting cell proliferation, survival, and neurogenesis in the developing hippocampus may be another potential mechanism underlying brain impairment associated with certain AED therapies in early life.", 
    "132": "A 30 second burst of microwave irradiation at an energy level insufficient to cause DNA denaturation or damage drives the covalent reaction between pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) antitumour agents and double-stranded or hairpin oligonucleotides to completion, a process that normally takes between 3-24 hours and thus offering the opportunity for higher-throughput screening of covalent-binding DNA-interactive agents.", 
    "133": "Acute and chronic anxiety represents the core symptoms in anxiety disorders. Anxiolytic pharmacological treatment mainly consists in administration of benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Whereas benzodiazepines show little, antidepressants show a relative large interindividual variability in terms of drug response where about one-third of patients do not respond at all. With no meaningful predictors available, there is increasing hope that genetics can help in adding important pieces of information in order to avoid lengthy drug trials and/or to avoid side effects. However, only few studies have been conducted with antidepressants and benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders. Similar to studies in major depression, some significant findings indicate that presence of the long allele of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene is associated with favorable response. Other significant findings pointed to the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor and to the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1) genes. To date, the most promising strategy in clinical practice appears to incorporate testing of functional CYP450 gene variants (CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYPD26 and CYP2C19) to avoid over- or under-dosing in poor or rapid metabolizers, respectively. As research progresses, it is likely that further gene variants will be detected that in conjunction with clinical variables will lead to algorithms allowing for individualized anxiolytic drug treatment.", 
    "134": "Weight gain, a serious problem associated with some antipsychotic drugs, notably olanzapine and clozapine, was suggested to be associated with -759C/T polymorphism of the 5-HT2C receptor gene. This study aimed to examine a potential association of two functional polymorphisms of the promoter region of this gene: -759C/T (rs3813929) and -697G/C (rs518147), with weight gain after 6 weeks of olanzapine monotherapy. It included 107 patients with schizophrenia; among them 36 are first-episode drug-naive patients. Analysis was carried out by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A protective effect of -759T and -697C alleles was found: significantly less patients with -697C (3/51) and no patient with -759T (0/28) alleles experienced body mass index increase >or=10% (P=0.0006 and 0.002, respectively). The same was true for drug-naive patients possessing any of the variant alleles. There was a significant association of haplotypes with a >or=10% body mass index increase (P=0.001). On the basis of the additional statistical analysis, the more important role of -697C allele was suggested.", 
    "135": "Melanoma is one of the most chemo-resistant cancers. The remission rate of current therapy remains low. Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) are a group of antitumor antibiotics that binds to N2 of guanine to form a DNA adduct. However, significant cardiotoxicity hampers their clinical use. We have previously synthesized a PBD indole conjugate (IN6CPBD) that induced apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the IN6CPBD for established murine melanoma cells in vivo. IN6CPBD induced more apoptosis than DC-81 as evidenced by sub-G1 distribution, annexin V positivity, and decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(mt)). The melanomas were established in C57BL/6 mice by injecting B16F10 cells via the tail vein. Three courses of therapy were instituted after day 5 and the mice were sacrificed at day 20. The tumor growth rate in the foot pad was significantly reduced in IN6CPBD-treated mice than that in DC-81- and PBS-treated mice. The tumor burden in the lungs was also reduced significantly in IN6CPBD-treated mice accompanied with the most prominent TUNEL staining. Renal function, and cardiac enzymes were not altered significantly by IN6CPBD or DC-81, however, robust deterioration of liver function was noticed in the DC-81-treated mice. In summary, potent apoptosis could be elicited by the PBD indole conjugate IN6CPBD, accompanied with a better efficacy and less liver function impairment than the mother compound DC-81 in treating established melanoma metastasis in vivo.", 
    "136": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) were used to detect diazepam exposure in skeletal tissues of rats (n = 15) given diazepam acutely (20 mg/kg, i.p.), and killed at various times postdose. Marrow, epiphyseal, and diaphyseal bone were isolated from extracted femora. Bone was cleaned, ground, and incubated in methanol. Marrow underwent ultrasonic homogenization. Extracts and homogenates were diluted in phosphate buffer, and then underwent solid-phase extraction and ELISA. Relative sensitivity of detection was examined in terms of relative decrease in absorbance (ELISA) and binary classification sensitivity (ELISA and LC/MS/MS). Overall, the data showed differences in relative sensitivity of detection of diazepam exposure in different tissue types (marrow > epiphyseal bone > diaphyseal bone), which is suggestive of heterogenous distribution in these tissues, and a decreasing sensitivity with increasing dose-death interval. Thus, the tissue type sampled and dose-death interval may contribute to the probability of detection of diazepam exposure in skeletal tissues.",

    "138": "The aim of this study was to demonstrate the value of mechanistic simulations in gaining insight into the behaviors of modified release (MR) formulations in vivo and to use the properly calibrated models for prediction of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). GastroPlus (Simulations Plus, Inc.) was used to fit mechanistic models for adinazolam and metoprolol that describe the absorption, PK, and PD after intravenous (i.v.) and immediate release (IR) oral (p.o.) administration. The fitted model for adinazolam was then used to predict the PD profile for a MR formulation and to design a new formulation with desired onset and duration of action. The fitted metoprolol model was used to gain insight and to explain the in vivo behaviors of MR formulations. For each drug, a single absorption/PK model was fitted that provided simulated plasma concentration-time profiles closely matching observed in vivo profiles across several different i.v. and p.o doses. Sedation score profiles of adinazolam were fitted with an indirect PD model. For metoprolol, the fitted absorption/PK model for IR p.o. doses was used to select in vitro dissolution conditions that best matched the in vivo release of MR doses. This model also explained differences in exposure after administration of MR formulations with different release rates. Mechanistic absorption/PK models allow for detailed descriptions of all processes affecting the two drugs' bioavailability, including release/dissolution, absorption, and intestinal and hepatic first pass extraction. The insights gained can be used to design formulations that more effectively overcome identified problems.",

Acute toxicity, neurotoxicity and potentiation of pentobarbitone induced sleep by extract was also studied.",

Anticonvulsant effect of extract was comparable to clinically used antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and diazepam). However, PTZ induced seizures were not inhibited. Animals pretreated with cyproheptadine showed inhibition of the anticonvulsant effect of extract.",

    "155": "The anticonvulsant lamotrigine and atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, as therapeutic alternative mood stabilizing drugs to lithium and valproate, are well-tolerated maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that both lithium and valproate increased expression of glutathione s-transferase (GST)-M1 subtype in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical cells. GST conjugates glutathione, the major antioxidant in brain, with a variety of oxidized products to form non-toxic and excretable products, and plays an important role in cellular protection against oxidative stress. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether lamotrigine and olanzapine also regulate GST-M1. Using immunoblotting analysis and spectrophotometric assay, we examined the effect of lamotrigine or olanzapine on GST-M1 protein levels and GST enzyme activity in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical cells. We found that chronic treatment with lamotrigine or olanzapine increased both GST-M1 protein levels and GST enzyme activity. These results suggest that GST-M1 may contribute a significant component to the treatment of bipolar disorder with mood stabilizing drugs.", 
    "156": "Coumarin is a compound known to be present in a wide variety of plants, microorganisms and animal species. Most of its effects were studied in organs and systems other than the central nervous system. The present work evaluated the effect of coumarin administration on the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (GLU), glycine (GLY) and taurine (TAU) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice. Male Swiss mice were treated with distilled water (controls), coumarin (20 or 40 mg/kg, i.p.) or diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Results showed that in the prefrontal cortex, coumarin at the lowest dose increased the levels of GLU and TAU, while GABA increased with both doses studied and GLY had its levels increased only at the dose of 40 mg/kg. Diazepam (DZP) increased the levels of GABA and TAU and decreased the levels of GLU and GLY in this area. In the hippocampus, only glutamate had its levels decreased after coumarin treatment, while diazepam increased the levels of GABA and TAU and decreased the levels of GLU in this brain region. We concluded that coumarin stimulates the release of endogenous amino acids, increasing the levels of inhibitory and excitatory amino acids in the prefrontal cortex, and decreasing glutamate levels in the hippocampus. Together, these results are of interest, considering that some neurodegenerative diseases and seizures are related to the imbalance of the amino acid levels in the CNS suggesting a perspective of a therapeutic use of coumarins in these disorders.", 
    "157": "The aim of the present investigation was to analyze the molecular mechanism(s) of diazepam neuroprotection in two models of selective neuronal death in CA1 sector of hippocampus: in vivo following transient gerbil brain ischemia and in vitro in rat hippocampal brain slices subjected to glutamatergic (100 microM NMDA) or oxidative (30 microM tertbutyl-hydroksyperoxide (TBH)) stress. In the in vivo model the diazepam treatment (two doses of 10mg/kg i.p. 30 and 90 min after the insult) resulted in more than 60% of CA1 hippocampal neurons surviving the insult comparing with 15% in untreated animals. To test whether the protective effect of diazepam was due to the postulated drug-induced hypothermia we followed the fluxes of body temperature during postischemic reperfusion: diazepam reduced temperature from 36.6+/-1 degrees C to 33.4+/-2 degrees C. Equivalent hypothermia induced and maintained in animals after ischemia did not prevent neuronal cell loss to the same extent as diazepam did (42.8+/-9.2% and 72.4+/-14.5% of live neurons, respectively). In vitro, under constant temperature conditions, diazepam exerted neuroprotective effects following a \"U-shaped\" dose-response curve, with concentration efficacy window of 0.5-10 microM. Five micro-molar diazepam showed significant protection by reducing over 50% the number of (dead) propidium iodide labeled cells even in the presence of GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. Next, we have shown that diazepam reduced the efflux of cytochrome c out of mitochondria both in compromised CA1 neurons in vitro and in isolated mitochondria treated with 30 microM THB. Our results suggest that the neuroprotective action of diazepam relies on additional mechanism(s) and not solely on its hypothermic effect. We suggest that diazepam evokes neuroprotection through its central receptors located on the GABA(A) receptor complex and, possibly, through its peripheral receptor, the translocator protein TSPO (previously called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) located in the outer mitochondrial membrane.", 
    "158": "Hypnotic drugs designed to treat insomnia in adults are now increasingly used in children, but the effects of these compounds on neonatal sleep are poorly understood. We investigated the hypnotic effects of the commonly prescribed non-benzodiazepine sleep agent Zolpidem (Ambien) on sleep architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the neonatal ferret. Six ferret kits were surgically prepared for EEG/electromyographic (EMG) recordings using techniques adopted for use in neonatal animals. They were then administered in a counter-balanced design vehicle, or Zolpidem (2 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection (1x/day over three days at 1 p.m.). Zolpidem did not increase non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) or total sleep time. Instead Zolpidem reduced REM sleep and total sleep amounts and increased NREM sleep bout duration. Zolpidem also increased higher-frequency EEG energies during REM and NREM sleep and transiently produced a behavioral state that appeared intermediate between wake and sleep. Our findings demonstrate that hypnotics that improve sleep quality in adults may produce profoundly different behavioral changes in neonates.", 
    "159": "Using selective bi-directional breeding procedures, two different lines of mice were developed. The NC900 line is highly reactive and attacks their social partners without provocation, whereas aggression in NC100 animals is uncommon in social environments. The enhanced reactivity of NC900 mice suggests that emotionality may have been selected with aggression. As certain forms of anxiety promote exaggerated defensive responses, we tested NC900 mice for the presence of an anxiety-like phenotype. In the open field, light-dark exploration, and zero maze tests, NC900 mice displayed anxiety-like responses. These animals were less responsive to the anxiolytic actions of diazepam in the zero maze than NC100 animals; diazepam also reduced the reactivity and attack behaviors of NC900 mice. The NC900 mice had reduced diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptor binding in brain regions associated with aggression and anxiety. Importantly, there was a selective reduction in levels of the GABA(A) receptor alpha(2) subunit protein in NC900 frontal cortex and amygdala; no changes in alpha(1) or gamma(2) subunit proteins were observed. These findings suggest that reductions in the alpha(2) subunit protein in selected brain regions may underlie the anxiety and aggressive phenotype of NC900 mice. Since anxiety and aggression are comorbid in certain psychiatric conditions, such as borderline personality and posttraumatic stress disorder, investigations with NC900 mice may provide new insights into basic mechanisms that underlie these and related psychiatric conditions.", 
    "160": "Earlier imaging studies in schizophrenia have reported abnormal amygdala and prefrontal cortex activity during emotion processing. We investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during emotion processing changes in activity of the amygdala and of prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia during 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment. Twelve previously drug-free/naive patients with schizophrenia were treated with olanzapine for 8 weeks and underwent two fMRI scans after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment during implicit and explicit emotional processing. Twelve healthy subjects were also scanned twice to control for potential repetition effects. Results showed a diagnosis by time interaction in left amygdala and a diagnosis by time by task interaction in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In particular, activity in left amygdala was greater in patients than in controls at the first scan during both explicit and implicit processing, while it was lower in patients at the second relative to the first scan. Furthermore, during implicit processing, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity was lower in patients than controls at the first scan, while it was greater in patients at the second relative to the first scan. These results suggest that longitudinal treatment with olanzapine may be associated with specific changes in activity of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during emotional processing in schizophrenia.",

    "170": "The cardioprotective effects of estrogen remain controversial in clinical practice. Previous reports have shown that cardioprotective mechanisms converge on the mitochondria, but the role of mitochondria in estrogen's actions on cardiac arrhythmias is unclear. Here, we report that stimulation or inhibition of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (mBzR) affected ventricular fibrillation (VF) almost in an \"all-or-none\" manner in an in vitro rat heart model of ischemic VF. Low concentrations of estrogen did not provide antiarrhythmic effects; however, the combination of mBzR activator and estrogen reduced VF incidence in hearts from either gender. Such synergistic actions also enabled cardiomyocytes to resist metabolic stress-induced intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) overload. Ligand binding experiments revealed that estrogen itself did not affect mBzR activity under basal conditions but promoted its up-regulation under myocardial ischemia. Our results suggest that mBzR may be an important molecule for ischemic arrhythmia and may act as a molecular switch for estrogen's antiarrhythmic effects. This finding provides a clue for elucidating the conflicting results regarding estrogen's cardiac effects in clinical studies and also suggests potential new strategies for hormone treatment in the female population.", 
    "171": "It has been shown that increased cerebral noradrenergic activity is closely related to anxiety-related behaviours. Furthermore, the noradrenergic alpha-2 receptor antagonist yohimbine (YOH) increases noradrenaline- (NA) cell firing and release in discrete brain areas involved in the modulation of anxiety such as the locus coeruleus (LC) and amygdala (AMY). In addition, YOH is highly anxiogenic in both humans and laboratory animals. Here we used an in vivo dual methodology to measure concomitantly the extracellular levels of catecholamines in AMY with voltammetry and the cell firing rate in LC with field electrophysiology in anaesthetized rats to characterize the pharmacological effects of YOH. We found that systemic administration of YOH increases both noradrenergic cell firing in the LC and catecholamines release in the AMY. Prior administration of the alpha-2 agonist clonidine prevents these effects on both the electrophysiological and the voltammetric signals, suggesting that YOH effects are mainly mediated by the alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In addition, we found that pre-treatment with the behaviourally active doses of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDE, Librium: BDZ very similar to diazepam) and of the non-BDZ buspirone counteract the effects of YOH on catecholamines release and cell firing. This suggests that the neurochemical and physiological effects of YOH measured in this study might be related to the anxiogenic effects of the drug. Thus, the presented electrophysiological-voltammetric-YOH study may be proposed as in vivo real time model of anxiety and this approach might be suitable for the evaluation of the neurochemical and physiological effects of new anxiolytic compounds.", 
    "172": "The nervous respiratory system undergoes postnatal maturation and yet still must be functional at birth. Any antenatal suboptimal environment could upset either its building prenatally and/or its maturation after birth. Here, we would like to briefly summarize some of the major stresses leading to clinical postnatal respiratory dysfunction that can occur during pregnancy, we then relate them to experimental models that have been developed in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms implicated in the respiratory dysfunctions observed in neonatal care units. Four sections are aimed to review our current knowledge based on experimental data. The first will deal with the metabolic factors such as oxygen and glucose, the second with consumption of psychotropic substances (nicotine, cocaine, alcohol, morphine, cannabis and caffeine), the third with psychoactive molecules commonly consumed by pregnant women within a therapeutic context and/or delivered to premature neonates in critical care units (benzodiazepine, caffeine). In the fourth section, we take into account care protocols involving extended maternal-infant separation due to isolation in incubators. The effects of this stress potentially adds to those previously described.", 
    "173": "At the rat motor nerve terminals, activation of muscarinic M(1) receptors negatively modulates the activity of inhibitory muscarinic M(2) receptors. The present work was designed to investigate if the negative crosstalk between muscarinic M(1) and M(2) autoreceptors involved endogenous adenosine tonically activating A(1) receptors on phrenic motor nerve terminals. The experiments were performed on rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations loaded with [(3)H]-choline (2.5 microCi/ml). Selective activation of muscarinic M(1) and adenosine A(1) receptors with 4-(N-[3-clorophenyl]-carbamoyloxy)-2-butyryltrimethylammonium (McN-A-343, 3 microM) and R-N(6)-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA, 100 nM), respectively, significantly attenuated inhibition of evoked [(3)H]-ACh release induced by muscarinic M(2) receptor activation with oxotremorine (10 microM). Attenuation of the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine (10 microM) by R-PIA (100 nM) was detected even in the presence of pirenzepine (1 nM) blocking M(1) autoreceptors, suggesting that suppression of M(2)-inhibiton by A(1) receptor activation is independent on muscarinic M(1) receptor activity. Conversely, the negative crosstalk between M(1) and M(2) autoreceptors seems to involve endogenous adenosine tonically activating A(1) receptors. This was suggested, since attenuation of the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine (10 microM) by McN-A-343 (3 microM) was suppressed by the A(1) receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (2.5 nM), and by reducing extracellular adenosine with adenosine deaminase (0.5 U/mL) or with the adenosine transport blocker, S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (NBTI, 10 microM). The results suggest that the negative crosstalk between muscarinic M(1) and M(2) autoreceptors involves endogenous adenosine outflow via NBTI-sensitive (es) nucleoside transport system channelling to the activation of presynaptic inhibitory A(1) receptors at the rat motor endplate.",

Water samples were prepared using solid-phase extraction and extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in both positive and negative ionization mode. The efficiency of ten different SPE cartridges to extract diverse compounds from water was tested. The pH-value of the water sample, the volume of elution solvent and the sample volume were optimized. Matrix effect, especially pronounced for cephalexin and metamizole, was eliminated using matrix-matched standards. It was determined that extraction should be performed at pH approximately 7.5, i.e. without pH adjustment, and at pH 3, depending on the analyte. Azithromycin, doxycycline and acetylsalicylic acid must be extracted in acidic environment, whereas extraction of paracetamol, ampicillin, erythromycin and metamizole should be performed without pH adjustment. Repeatability of the method was generally lower than 20%. The estimated limits of detection were in the range from 0.15 to 12.46 ng l(-1). The method was applied to 26 water samples for monitoring of selected drug residues. Results revealed the presence of carbamazepine (80% of water samples), azithromycin (23%), as well as trimethoprim and paracetamol (both 15%). The most striking was the false positive signal of diclofenac in every analyzed water sample. Confirmation of the positive results was performed by repeated injection of the positive sample extracts using confirmatory method with additional transitions.",

    "185": "We identified 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria and evaluated 15 compounds: second-generation antipsychotics, first-generation antipsychotics, cholinergic enhancers, an antiepileptic agent, an inhaled anesthetic, injectable sedatives, and a benzodiazepine. Four trials evaluated delirium treatment and suggested no differences in efficacy or safety among the evaluated treatment methods (first and second generation antipsychotics). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor procholinergic drugs were effective in preventing delirium. Multiple studies, however, suggest either shorter severity and duration, or prevention of delirium with the use of haloperidol, risperidone, gabapentin, or a mixture of sedatives in patients undergoing elective or emergent surgical procedures.", 
    "186": "The existing limited data indicates no superiority for second-generation antipsychotics over haloperidol in managing delirium. Although preliminary results suggest delirium prevention may be accomplished through various mechanisms, further studies are necessary to prove effectiveness.", 
    "187": "Almost all clases of psychiatric drugs (typical and atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines) have been reported as possible causes of haematological toxicity. This is a review of the literature in which different clinical situations involving red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and impaired coagulation are detailed and the drugs more frequently involved are listed. The haematological adverse reactions detailed here include: aplastic anemia, haemolitic anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, disordered platelet function and impaired coagulation. The haematologic toxicity profile of the drugs more frequently involved: lithium, clozapine, carbamazepine, valproic acid and SSRI antidepressants is mentioned."
